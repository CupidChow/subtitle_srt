”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

2
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:17,630
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:21,210
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,710
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:28,250
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,440
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,290
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:38,860
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:42,260
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,970
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:49,470
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:53,140
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:56,420
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,980
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:03,590
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:07,110
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,620
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,080
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,950
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,840
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,260
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,930
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,190
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:31,920
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,500
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,960
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,100
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,100
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

[Eternal Love]

30
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,860
[Episode 9]

31
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,950
Your Second Highness.

32
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,880
You may all go.

33
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,410
Yes.

34
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,960
What do you think of this place?

35
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,090
How does it compare to Green Hill?

36
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:06,940
It's beautiful!

37
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,910
This is the Lotus Pond of the Heavenly Palace.

38
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,280
It's also the most beautiful place here.

39
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:18,810
Shao Xin, it wasn't my intention to sneak you up into the Heavenly Palace.

40
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:24,790
Give me some time to find a way to introduce you formally to everyone,

41
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:27,380
so that you can receive worship from all of the Immortals.

42
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,230
Your Second Highness.

43
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,230
Third Younger Brother.

44
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:46,530
Second Older Brother, does she come from the Green Hill Fox Den?

45
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,120
She's the maidservant that I just brought up.

46
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,810
I plan to have her serve me personally.

47
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,620
What's wrong, Third Younger Brother?

48
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:57,450
Since when did you show such interest to my personal maidservants?

49
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:01,520
I asked you if she came from the Green Hill Fox Den.

50
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,620
Did Ye Hua tell you?

51
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,870
So she really is Bai Qian's maidservant.

52
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,750
That's right.

53
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,870
Second Older Brother, we need to hurry.

54
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:22,910
You need to send this little Bashe snake back to Green Hill before Father Monarch returns.

55
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,880
No. You can't go.

56
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,760
I'll go.

57
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,110
Since I brought her up here, I won't send her back.

58
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,970
You can't mess around with this.

59
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:40,080
You can pick anyone, just not her!

60
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,950
I'm the second son of the Heavenly Monarch.

61
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:45,440
Can I not even decide who my wife and concubines should be?

62
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:50,650
After that battle 70,000 years ago, High God Mo Yuan's spirit was shattered,

63
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:53,530
and the Heavenly Realm's minor tribe leaders are growing more disgruntled with Father Monarch.

64
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,650
Father Monarch wanted to stabilize his throne.

65
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,690
That's why he formed your marriage alliance with Green Hill.

66
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:00,300
- Second Older Brother, you can't just—
- Enough!

67
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,940
I understand.

68
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,810
We can't offend Green Hill.

69
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,760
I'm glad you know.

70
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:11,320
It's fine if you want to force me to marry Bai Qian, but I like her maidservant.

71
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,440
She also needs to marry me.

72
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,980
You can't do that!

73
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,640
You haven't even married Bai Qian yet, but you've seduced her maidservant.

74
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,580
And you want to marry both at the same time?

75
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:26,410
Aren't you... you telling the world that Bai Qian can't even compare to a little Bashe snake?

76
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,560
Your Second Highness, you should just send me back.

77
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:37,590
Shao Xin, don't be afraid.

78
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,960
Third Younger Brother, you're right.

79
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,980
Please consider the big picture, Second Older Brother.

80
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:52,410
When Father Monarch returns, I will report to him and ask him to break off the engagement with Bai Qian.

81
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:57,260
Then I will officially marry my consort.

82
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,790
You're breaking off the engagement?

83
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,550
What did you say?

84
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:05,280
You want to break off the engagement?

85
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:21,270
Father Monarch, I originally thought since I was born as the prince of the Heavenly Tribe,

86
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:25,510
then my marriage will be in appearance only, for the sake of the Heavenly Tribe.

87
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,000
Is that not the case?

88
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,800
I honestly thought that before I went to Green Hill.

89
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,070
But once I arrived at Green Hill, I didn't see my fiancée, Bai Qian.

90
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:40,650
She left a message that she'll be in a cultivating retreat,

91
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,820
and left me at the Green Hill den.

92
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,360
Even thought I was mad,

93
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,860
I obeyed your instructions and kept waiting for her return.

94
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:58,100
But I waited for a month.

95
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:05,080
I think that Bai Qian of Green Hill is arrogant and despises our Heavenly Tribe.

96
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,980
A month is nothing.

97
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:10,990
Even if she asks you to wait for 30,000 years, you'll need to wait.

98
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,700
Besides, she inherited the title of the female monarch of Green Hill of Eastern Wilderness,

99
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,870
A prince marrying a female monarch.

100
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,450
How can you be unsatisfied?

101
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:22,470
But, Father Monarch, I—

102
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:29,070
Sang Ji, do you have something to say?

103
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,440
I...

104
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,060
I...

105
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,520
Let me guess what you want to say.

106
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:45,810
Did you fall deeply in love with another woman in Green Hill?

107
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:49,820
I won't dare do anything that disobeys you.

108
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,990
Fine.

109
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:56,720
Men, bring in the little Bashe Snake that trespassed into the Heavenly Palace.

110
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:14,040
How did you get to know him in Green Hill?

111
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,660
Heavenly Monarch, I do not know him.

112
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,720
You've forgotten?

113
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,570
You don't need to look at her.

114
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:30,330
In the Heavenly Palace, whether you are a prince or my grandchild, you have to sever any feelings.

115
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:36,470
Marrying and having heirs are for the sake of the Heavenly Tribe and Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses,

116
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,610
not for personal passions.

117
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,470
He can't save you.

118
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:45,200
He won't dare save you either.

119
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,750
Heavenly Monarch, I really don't know him.

120
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:54,660
- Throw this little Bashe Snake that trespassed into our palace into the Immortal Execution Platform.
- Yes!

121
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,540
Mercy, Heavenly Monarch! Heavenly Monarch!

122
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,550
You stop right there!

123
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,960
I'm the one that wants to break off the engagement. It has nothing to do with Shao Xin!

124
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,480
What did you say?

125
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,760
Even though Shao Xin is Bai Qian's maidservant, she is the one I love.

126
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,710
I beg of you, Father Monarch.

127
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:16,850
Please allow me to break the engagement with Bai Qian and marry Shao Xin.

128
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:21,380
Things have come to this extent, yet you still want to marry her?

129
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,820
That's right.

130
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:28,750
For the rest of my life, I will not marry anyone else but Shao Xin.

131
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,570
Scoundrel.

132
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:40,440
Throw this little Bashe snake in the Demon Tower.

133
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,610
Without my consent, no one can go near it.

134
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,740
- Yes!
- Heavenly Monarch, spare my life! Heavenly Monarch!

135
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,700
Father Monarch, Demon Tower isn't a place that she can go.

136
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,230
Father Monarch.

137
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:54,220
I want to see how long she can last in there.

138
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,200
She even dared to seduce my son.

139
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,800
She didn't seduce me.

140
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,490
I sincerely like her!

141
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,580
Sang Ji,

142
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,200
do you want your nephew to see how disappointing you are?

143
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,450
Kneel here.

144
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,630
Ye Hua.

145
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,880
I'm here.

146
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,070
Don't be like your Second Uncle.

147
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,870
I have high expectations of you.

148
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,170
You are the future Heavenly Monarch.

149
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,200
In this Heavenly Palace, you can have many concubines,

150
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:51,760
but you must not have a woman who can make you lose your principles.

151
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,510
You are born for the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses, not for a woman.

152
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,520
I understand.

153
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:04,280
Greetings, Heavenly Monarch.

154
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,410
Crown Prince, Your Highness.

155
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,830
- What do you have to say?
- Heavenly Monarch,

156
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:11,620
it is still about the Zhongrong Empire in the mortal realm.

157
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,410
I have handed this over to the Crown Prince.

158
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:18,380
The Fiery Golden Lion belonged to Qing Cang.

159
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:22,160
Go and subdue it to show your power to the Four Seas

160
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,910
as preparation for you to receive your crown prince seal in the future.

161
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,550
Yes.

162
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:39,420
Your Highness the Crown Prince, there's something you must remember.

163
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,910
What is it?

164
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:45,140
When you go and subdue the beast, do not mess with the fate of the mortals.

165
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:48,240
If an immortal were to have any relations with humans, it will mess with heavenly laws.

166
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,720
It won't benefit you.

167
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,910
The fate of mortals has always been handled by you.

168
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,940
I will not interfere.

169
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,180
I understand.

170
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:16,210
Heavenly Monarch, I have finished my homework.

171
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,730
In the past, Sang Ji had very high comprehension skills,

172
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,990
but he didn't do as well as you.

173
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:37,520
I will reward you handsomely. What do you want?

174
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:41,270
I want to see my mother.

175
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,580
A kind mother will bring up a useless son.

176
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,760
In the future you are to succeed me.

177
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,670
Your mother will not be able to raise you properly for sure.

178
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:51,570
She will only raise you to be indecisive and gentle.

179
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:55,760
I'm not letting you see her for your own good.

180
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,830
I just want to see Mother.

181
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,670
If I you want me to give you permission to see her,

182
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:08,800
you must achieve the High Immortal rank before you are 20,000 years old.

183
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:41,350
Heavenly Monarch, this lightning is not your average lightning.

184
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:44,160
It is heavenly lightning only immortals use for ascension.

185
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,500
If he cannot endure it, he will lose his life.

186
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,970
His Young Highness is only 20,000 years old.

187
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,760
Keep quiet.

188
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:16,160
Heavenly Monarch, you promised me that if I could achieve the High Immortal rank before I'm 20,000 years old,

189
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,680
you will allow me to see my mother.

190
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,460
Today, I have achieved it.

191
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:25,130
When can I see my mother?

192
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:31,070
Take Ye Hua to see his mother.

193
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,060
Thank you, Father Monarch.

194
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,900
Ye Hua.

195
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:22,660
He's my only son.

196
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:27,820
When he was born, he was already conferred as the Crown Prince.

197
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:32,150
Ever since you took him away from me 20,000 years ago,

198
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:35,640
I have never even see him once.

199
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:41,550
Why is your body full of scars when you finally show up?

200
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:51,780
Is it not his blessing to be born in the Heavenly Palace, but a misfortune?

201
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,340
Ye Hua is the future Heavenly Monarch.

202
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:59,470
Having heavy expectations for him is only natural.

203
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:02,030
So what if he'll be the Heavenly Monarch?

204
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:06,390
If he cannot be happy, I'd rather just give him a simple title.

205
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:11,280
Being a minor Water Monarch is better than being in this Heavenly Palace.

206
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,100
Mother, don't blame Father.

207
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,080
It's all my fault.

208
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,200
I clearly knew that I had to endure the heavenly tribulation,

209
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,890
yet I wore such plain and light-coloured clothes.

210
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:27,150
In the future, I will only wear black.

211
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:32,820
Then you won't be able to see any bloodstains so you won't be sad.

212
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,030
Look.

213
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:40,730
What have you become after being taught by your father and Heavenly Monarch?

214
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:45,080
Do you think by changing your clothes, you won't bleed?

215
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:52,430
You are merely hiding it, so no one can see.

216
00:16:52,430 --> 00:17:00,050
Your personality of gritting your teeth and suffering everything alone will only cause you to hurt yourself.

217
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,220
You're awake.

218
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,770
Why did you come here?

219
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:07,260
I've come to bring you food.

220
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,480
Here.

221
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,160
Who was that shadow?

222
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,160
Why does it keep appearing recently?

223
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,970
Could it be something ominous?

224
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:34,120
Ye Hua, I've made you so many clothes,

225
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,660
but why do you only wear black all the time?

226
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,130
Such a heavy demeanor.

227
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,570
You don't look like a youth at all.

228
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,330
Today, I heard people in the palace saying

229
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:49,300
that Second Highness especially went to Green Hill to propose marriage,

230
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,850
but instead fell for the maidservant of Bai Qian.

231
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:57,080
I actually feel that it's good for Second Highness to marry a little Bashe snake.

232
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:01,570
I heard that Bai Qian from Green Hill has inherited the throne as the female monarch.

233
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:05,490
Her status is very high, and we are both her juniors.

234
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:08,300
If one day, she really enters the Heavenly Palace,

235
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,650
I fear that the two of us won't be able to live comfortably.

236
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,800
Ye Hua!

237
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,530
Ye Hua!

238
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,460
Heavenly Monarch has given orders that no one is allowed entry into the Demon Tower.

239
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,240
How dare you!

240
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,890
You dare stop me, too?

241
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:39,590
Move aside.

242
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,050
Move aside!

243
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:44,520
Second Highness, please conduct yourself properly.

244
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,300
- You!
- Second Older Brother.

245
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,560
Second Older Brother!

246
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,550
This is the decree of Father Monarch. Stop making things difficult for them.

247
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:56,600
Shao Xin is inside and I don't even know if she's still alive.

248
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,870
How can I be at ease?

249
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,860
Let me try.

250
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,770
The decree of Heavenly Monarch is to not allow anyone to go near,

251
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:10,450
for being afraid that someone will take the little Bashe snake away.

252
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:13,720
But he didn't say that no one is allowed to speak with her.

253
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,420
Am I right?

254
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:26,330
Second Older Brother, go ask and see how Miss Shao Xin is.

255
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:28,510
Then, we can discuss and plan it at length.

256
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,290
Don't be rash.

257
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,750
Shao Xin, can you hear me?

258
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:46,640
Shao Xin! Shao Xin!

259
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,060
Second Highness!

260
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:55,050
Shao Xin, have the vile beasts in there hurt you?

261
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:02,840
Second Highness, other than Great Lady, you treat me the best.

262
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,010
I've lived for 70,000 to 80,000 years.

263
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:08,410
Meeting you is my great fortune.

264
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,900
Second Highness!

265
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,760
Shao Xin! Shao Xin!

266
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:20,020
Second Highness!

267
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:23,620
Second Highness!

268
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,650
Second Older Brother! Second Older Brother!

269
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,340
Ye Hua, you should have taken in one or two concubines already.

270
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:08,240
Do you have any women that you like?

271
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,640
None.

272
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:20,700
You... just don't have any interest in women.

273
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,370
Yet your Second Uncle...

274
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:28,300
It was clearly a great marriage that others could only dream about.

275
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,950
Yet he wants to break off an engagement.

276
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,990
Heavenly Monarch, Second Highness asks for an audience with you.

277
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,830
An audience?

278
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:41,410
Didn't I tell him to lock himself in his palace to reflect on his mistakes?

279
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:43,890
- Tell him to go back.
- Heavenly Monarch,

280
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:46,800
Second Highness is kneeling outside Purple Morning Palace.

281
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,610
I dare not ask him to leave.

282
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,400
- Let him in.
- Yes.

283
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,080
Leave now.

284
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,600
You need not go out.

285
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,800
Yes, Mighty Monarch.

286
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:22,840
Second Uncle.

287
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,770
Father Monarch.

288
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,760
Still afraid of being embarrassed?

289
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,320
No need to be afraid.

290
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,450
Since you fell for that little Bashe snake,

291
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:49,680
you surely will be a laughingstock of the whole Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses.

292
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,870
What's there to fear in front of your nephew now?

293
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:54,590
Say it.

294
00:23:55,780 --> 00:24:01,800
I came today to ask Father Monarch to let Shao Xin go.

295
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:07,930
No need to talk about this again.

296
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:10,760
I will never change my mind.

297
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:16,780
I beg you to stop forcing me.

298
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:25,100
If you insist on doing this,

299
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:28,000
I can only kill myself to keep her company.

300
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,170
Do you want to die for her?

301
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:33,560
I'm the distinguished second prince of the Heavenly Tribe,

302
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,000
but I can't even defend my own woman.

303
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,870
It's better to just die.

304
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,180
Okay.

305
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,980
Okay.

306
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:50,850
That's my son.

307
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:52,910
Sang Ji, listen well.

308
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:55,120
I won't stop you if you want to die,

309
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:00,660
but the life of that little Bashe snake is still in my hands.

310
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,340
Go destroy your spirit by yourself.

311
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:11,120
Once you die, I have my ways to torture that little Bashe snake.

312
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,500
Why must you make things difficult for Shao Xin?

313
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,930
I just wanted to take in a concubine.

314
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,990
Why can't I?

315
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:22,770
I don't care if you want to take in concubines.

316
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:29,680
But just for a woman, you disobeyed me, and even wanted to die for her!

317
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:35,910
As the prince of the Heavenly Tribe, you can equally favor women,

318
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:43,840
but you can't lose the right sense of propriety just because of a woman.

319
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:50,490
I'm not intentionally making things hard for her.

320
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,710
It's you who harmed her.

321
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:56,650
Leave now.

322
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,330
Second Highness has no sense of propriety.

323
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,790
In just a few days, the news about him breaking off his engagement

324
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:27,830
has spread all over the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses.

325
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Let him break off the engagement then.

326
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,020
But to use a maidservant to insult my daughter is intolerable.

327
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:40,050
I cannot accept this!

328
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,960
Indeed.

329
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,450
It mustn't be accepted.

330
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:48,940
Let's go to the Heavenly Palace.

331
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:54,490
They're not coming, but we need to go there instead?!

332
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:56,040
Don't you know yet?

333
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,310
Your daughter, the one who's a laughingstock to the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses,

334
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:01,610
has been living in my Peach Blossoms Forest for five days.

335
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:04,930
She doesn't want to marry him, either.

336
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:09,460
Why not use this chance for us in the Green Hill to take the initiative in breaking off this engagement?

337
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,070
What?

338
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:13,060
We break off the engagement?!

339
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,360
Right. Not only will we break it off,

340
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,600
we will make the Heavenly Tribe apologize to us.

341
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:48,220
You have been sleeping in ignorant bliss for five days.

342
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:51,240
Have I slept for five days?

343
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:59,050
The day after tomorrow is the day that Qing Cang will break through the bell.

344
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:01,870
I wonder if I will be able to come back.

345
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:05,230
Let me take another look of this Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms.

346
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,130
Your expression doesn't seem right.

347
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:11,690
Are you troubled by Sang Ji's wish to break off the engagement?

348
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:16,370
Because of Sang Ji?

349
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:22,500
I met him when I was Si Yin.

350
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,720
I have no opinions about him.

351
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,990
Hence, him breaking off of the engagement doesn't affect me.

352
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:29,090
What's there to be sad about?

353
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:31,750
That's good then. Let's go.

354
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:35,360
Fourth Older Brother, let me ask you a question.

355
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,580
Do you think that 70,000 years ago, if Qing Cang was not sealed,

356
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:41,400
how would the Four Seas be like now?

357
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,200
If Qing Cang wasn't sealed, then Mo Yuan would still be alive.

358
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,560
If Mo Yuan was alive, there would surely be peace in the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses.

359
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,190
That's right. If Teacher were alive,

360
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:54,170
there would be peace in Four Seas.

361
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:57,470
By the way, Fourth Older Brother, where is Young Jiu?

362
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,840
Didn't she say she would be in the Peach Blossoms Forest these few days?

363
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,480
Young Jiu?

364
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,750
She hasn't been back for the past few days,

365
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,980
but she will definitely be back today.

366
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,140
Why must it be today?

367
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:12,270
Did you forget? Today is your birthday.

368
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:14,540
Although you have lived for more than ten thousand years,

369
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:17,440
this birthday is not something to be cherished.

370
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,830
But Young Jiu has been with you since she was young.

371
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:22,490
She's even more filial to you than her biological father.

372
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:24,560
Today is your birthday.

373
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,980
She will definitely be back.

374
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,770
This is really too slow.

375
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:46,300
Once I go through this forest, it will be Green Hill.

376
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,900
Let's go.

377
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,950
I... I didn't mean to trespass this forest.

378
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,940
I'm just using this path.

379
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,290
I... I'm Bai Fengjiu from Green Hill.

380
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:50,310
Don't be unreasonable.

381
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,020
Emperor Dong Hua?

382
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,440
Who are you?

383
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,940
Emperor Dong Hua.

384
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,580
What?

385
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:52,100
How long will you keep hugging me?

386
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:01,190
Are you really Emperor Dong Hua?

387
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:02,740
Don't I look like him?

388
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:08,100
You don't. I saw a painting of you in Zhe Yan's library.

389
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:10,740
You really don't look like him.

390
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,500
Zhe Yan?

391
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,770
Yes, Zhe Yan. He's the High God from Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms.

392
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:18,020
Who are you?

393
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:23,050
I'm Bai Fengjiu, the daughter of the Northern Wilderness Emperor of Green Hill, a descendant of the Nine-Tailed Fox Tribe.

394
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,290
I, Bai Fengjiu from Green Hill, greet Emperor Dong Hua.

395
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:30,150
So, it's the Bai family.

396
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:34,100
Someone from the Bai family is afraid of the Golden Lion?

397
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,670
You haven't transcended into the immortal rank yet, right?

398
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,340
No, I haven't.

399
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:51,770
Since you have saved me, I must reciprocate.

400
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:53,380
No need.

401
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,910
How can this be?

402
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:58,380
My aunt always teaches me that there is a cycle of karma in this world.

403
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:01,830
If there's a reason, there's always a cause. Favors must be returned.

404
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,280
Your aunt?

405
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,410
Bai Qian from Green Hill?

406
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:07,990
Emperor, do you know my aunt?

407
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:10,390
We met by chance several times.

408
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:15,090
Your aunt and the Heavenly Tribe have a strong affinity.

409
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:18,740
Really? Why haven't I heard her mention this?

410
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:21,680
She doesn't seem to be willing to mention the Heavenly Tribe.

411
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:26,320
Don't you know that Zhe Yan and the Fox Emperor Bai Zhi are at Heavenly Tribe right now,

412
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,320
asking for an explanation for your aunt?

413
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,030
Is that so?

414
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:40,630
How long will you keep following me?

415
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:44,250
I... I merely wanted to repay your kindness.

416
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:25,700
Emperor, I had been guarding here for almost 70,000 years.

417
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,330
This Donghuang Bell has never showed any abnormal activities.

418
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:30,460
But I checked the cosmic objects today,

419
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:33,020
and it seems Qing Cang will be making some activities today.

420
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,530
How is this possible?

421
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:39,070
Several thousand years ago, wasn't Qing Cang sealed up by High God Mo Yuan?

422
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:46,100
If what you said is true, Emperor, I fear that...

423
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,850
I know you can't defeat Qing Cang.

424
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:50,420
Keep watching this bell closely.

425
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:53,230
If there are any unusual changes in the next ten days,

426
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:57,110
vibrate this bell, and I will rush back immediately.

427
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:00,140
I will abide.

428
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:06,330
Remember, regardless of any unusual movements,

429
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:09,110
you must use magic to vibrate the bell.

430
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,980
I will abide.

431
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:23,560
Because you are a Princess from Green Hill, I will not have any disputes with you.

432
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:27,880
However, if you keep following me, I will lose my temper.

433
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,600
That person...?

434
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,590
Your Highness, he's Emperor Dong Hua.

435
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:43,860
When I went to Heavenly Palace with the Winged Monarch twenty thousand years ago,

436
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:46,300
I was fortunate to see him once.

437
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,840
Emperor is a top senior in Heavenly Palace.

438
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:52,470
Even the Heavenly Monarch must be very polite to him.

439
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:55,060
What is he doing here?

440
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:58,240
I have no idea.

441
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:01,730
Let's not bother about them first.

442
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,260
Father Monarch,

443
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:24,250
ever since the day of the Great Battle,

444
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:27,270
Eldest Brother has been missing.

445
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:29,790
Second Older Brother...

446
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:33,100
Second Older Brother is no longer who he used to be.

447
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:38,780
He still hates what you have done to his birth mother.

448
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:45,870
It has been 70,000 years and he's still not willing to come to see you.

449
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,600
Father Monarch,

450
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:58,130
I beg you to bless me in finding my eldest brother soon.

451
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,680
Third Uncle, you followed me until here.

452
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,860
Do you have something to say?

453
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,310
Do I?

454
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:11,460
I didn't notice that I'd walked here.

455
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:14,430
Third Uncle, if you want to say something, just say it.

456
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,000
Ye Hua,

457
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,590
since you've been cultivating, you've achieved a lot of achievements that others can't surpass.

458
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:26,800
You're also the current crown prince, the future heavenly monarch.

459
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:32,320
But in my eyes, you're still imperfect.

460
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,990
How am I imperfect?

461
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,650
We both are standing here now.

462
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:46,100
With one eye, we can identify the phases of the moon.

463
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,370
But to say that a moon is full or perfect,

464
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:53,480
you must experience the taste of love to understand the phases of life.

465
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:57,110
You lack a love tribulation.

466
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,810
Love?

467
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:03,510
Look at that dismissive expression of yours.

468
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:05,230
Let me ask you then.

469
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:09,150
In your eyes, what does everything that your second uncle has been doing amount to?

470
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:11,460
Spinning a cocoon around himself.

471
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,020
Is that so?

472
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:20,150
If you were the one asked to marry a woman whom you didn't know and hadn't seen, would you be willing?

473
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,360
Let me give you some random example.

474
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:26,650
If you were to marry that Bai Qian of Green Hill, what would you do?

475
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:31,690
No matter if it's Bai Qian of Green Hill or Qing Qian of White Hills, there's not much difference.

476
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:34,910
As long as Heavenly Monarch grants the marriage, I'll marry her.

477
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:36,950
Really?

478
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:45,550
Third Uncle, are you trying to sound me out?

479
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:51,380
I'm thinking of a way to save your second uncle.

480
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:54,620
I think he has really fallen in love this time.

481
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:59,090
I fear that he'll commit a huge mistake for that little Bashe snake.

482
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:04,900
Hence, you want me to marry Bai Qian of Green Hill in place of Second Uncle?

483
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,780
Correct.

484
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,780
You are the crown prince of the Heavenly Tribe.

485
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:12,120
Although you haven't officially received the crown prince stamp,

486
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,350
for the 20,000 years you've been handling official affairs,

487
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:19,610
the immortals of the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses already see you as the crown prince.

488
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:22,300
Only you can pacify this matter.

489
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:26,810
Only you can replace your second uncle in placating Green Hill.

490
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,280
Okay.

491
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:33,130
That easy?

492
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:36,480
Don't you dare deceive me.

493
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,750
That Bai Qian is 90,000 years older than you.

494
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:42,690
It's just an additional person sleeping by your side.

495
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,720
There's nothing hard about it.

496
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,670
Through and through.

497
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:53,170
I'm glad you're able to see through it.

498
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:13,630
Heavenly Monarch brought up the marriage between the Heavenly Tribe and Green Hill to begin with.

499
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:16,260
Now, it led to this huge joke.

500
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:20,180
How will everyone from the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses look at my daughter, Bai Qian, now?!

501
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:22,990
Heavenly Monarch, do you know?

502
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:28,850
After this incident, I feel ashamed to face you, Fox Emperor.

503
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:31,040
That little Bashe snake is indeed hateful.

504
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,150
As a maidservant of High Immortal Bai Qian,

505
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:37,170
she dared to seduce my son and scheme to be married into the Heavenly Palace.

506
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:41,250
Even if you, Fox Emperor, are able to endure it, I can't.

507
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:45,910
In my opinion, Young Fifth didn't give any importance to this marriage alliance, either.

508
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:48,050
Why not just break it off?

509
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:50,350
- How about it?
- Yes.

510
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:52,150
No.

511
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:54,350
This engagement can't be broken off.

512
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:28,070
”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

513
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:29,990
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

514
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:32,740
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

515
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:38,100
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

516
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:47,060
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

517
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,330
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

518
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:56,740
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

519
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:02,810
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

520
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:08,730
♫ All are just illusions ♫

521
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:15,720
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

522
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:20,980
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

523
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:25,300
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

524
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:31,610
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

525
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:36,980
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

526
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:42,250
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

527
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:45,170
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

528
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:53,890
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from my previous life ♫

529
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:06,180
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

530
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:11,640
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

531
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:15,970
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

532
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:22,190
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

533
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:27,620
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

534
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:32,920
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

535
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,590
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

536
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:44,940
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

537
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:57,070
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
