00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,510
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:21,080
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,690
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,950
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:31,400
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,220
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,820
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,320
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,010
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:49,310
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:53,040
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,250
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,210
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,560
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,110
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,590
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,150
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,050
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,800
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,230
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:24,330
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,790
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:31,920
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,350
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,340
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,050
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:46,680
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:12,980
[Episode 34]

31
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,970
I got it.

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,710
Great Lady, do you have a mental disorder?

33
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,910
I want to get a little immortal from Green Hill

34
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:32,850
and let him be Ye Hua's closed disciple of the kitchen.

35
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:37,650
That way, we can still eat if Ye Hua leaves Green Hill.

36
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,800
Okay, I'll find someone.

37
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:54,160
I have arranged for a maidservant to disguise as a Daoist nun to take care of Yuan Zhen in the Mortal Realm.

38
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,770
Why must you insist on going to Green Hill to see Bai Qian?

39
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,960
You don't understand.

40
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:06,130
A mother wouldn't allow for her child to experience any pain or suffering.

41
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:11,900
I need to find Great Lady to have her help Yuan Zhen with his tribulation.

42
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:17,060
He brought this trouble upon himself; hence, he must suffer the tribulation.

43
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,750
Forget Bai Qian of Green Hill.

44
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,940
Even High God Zhe Yan can't help.

45
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,770
No.

46
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:29,000
Great Lady can help.

47
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:35,450
You believe in your Great Lady too much.

48
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,570
It's not that I believe in her too much.

49
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:42,210
Heavenly Tribe owes Green Hill because of what happened with me.

50
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:46,780
No one else may care about this, but Great Lady will be able to.

51
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,530
Even if Great Lady changes Yuan Zhen's fate,

52
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,890
Heavenly Monarch will turn a blind eye to it.

53
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,870
What you say does make sense.

54
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:03,760
But with Bai Qian's personality, if she gives you a hard time...

55
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,540
Don't worry.

56
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,570
Great Lady already gave me back the Cloud-Breaking Fan

57
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,710
and she allowed me one wish.

58
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,630
She's someone who keeps her words.

59
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,290
She definitely won't turn me down.

60
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,630
[Recruiting]

61
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,230
Mushroom Immortal, what are you posting?

62
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:31,090
Great Lady wants to choose a little immortal to be Monarch Ye Hua's closed disciple of the kitchen.

63
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,410
It's a rare opportunity.

64
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:37,110
To be Monarch Ye Hua's closed disciple is a fortune in itself, even if it's for the kitchen.

65
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,600
But in just a few minutes, there's a long queue of two lines in front of the fox den.

66
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,000
If we go now, I fear it's too late.

67
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,120
It's not late. It's tonight so we have time.

68
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,900
Let's go!

69
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:52,090
Take a look. It's His Highness the Crown Prince. Seriously.

70
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,650
Next.

71
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,280
Let me record this.

72
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,790
- My turn.
- I'm good.

73
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:09,490
I can wash the dishes. I can cook, too!

74
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,210
Next.

75
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:15,280
I heard from Mi Gu that you are choosing a disciple for me.

76
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,840
That's right.

77
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,980
I can cook beef!

78
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,860
I can cook fish.

79
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,480
Next.

80
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,310
What can you make?

81
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,840
Tell them all to go.

82
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,840
None of them are good.

83
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,910
I got it.

84
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,150
In my opinion, you're perfect for this.

85
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,170
But you don't need to learn from me.

86
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:44,510
It's good enough that one of us can cook.

87
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,740
Mi Gu.

88
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:54,960
Great Lady, who does His Highness the Crown Prince want?

89
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,700
He doesn't want any of them.

90
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,770
Tell them all to go.

91
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:03,060
Tell... Tell them all to leave?

92
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,170
You can go. You can go.

93
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:10,530
- Sure, let's go.
- Let's go.

94
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,920
I'll go row the boat with Young Heavenly Grandson then.

95
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,200
Let's go.

96
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,150
Come.

97
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,750
Qian Qian,

98
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,680
come on a walk with me.

99
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,020
You are so lazy and allow the flowers here to grow on their own,

100
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,500
yet they naturally become carvings.

101
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,800
It's even comparable to the ponds of the Heavenly Palace.

102
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,780
What a rare sight.

103
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,320
Who says so? This is a wild pond.

104
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,810
How can be it compared to your Jade Pond?

105
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:07,790
Over the years, the immortals and mortals have written thousands of poems about your Jade Pond.

106
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,760
It has been marveled by thousands and millions.

107
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,670
Do you want to see it?

108
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:16,150
- See what?
- Nine Heavens and the Jade Pond.

109
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,140
Maybe later.

110
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:23,850
Based on what you said, you have never been to Heavenly Palace.

111
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:26,400
Aren't you curious?

112
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,060
I haven't been to many places.

113
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:33,120
If I'm curious about everywhere, I'd be tired all the time.

114
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,440
Look at Kunlun Void. It's also a famous place in Four Seas.

115
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,100
I've never been there, either.

116
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,560
Do you admire Kunlun Void, too?

117
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,550
This is bad. Why did I bring up Kunlun Void?

118
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,070
Where is Mi Gu?

119
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,290
Mi Gu set up a divine barrier at the mouth of the valley.

120
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:02,590
I'm afraid that someone has trespassed.

121
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,050
Great Lady.

122
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,430
She brought this fan over so soon.

123
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,260
It seems like she's made up her mind.

124
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,250
Does that mean...?

125
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,890
Bring her in.

126
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,520
Yes.

127
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,570
What did Great Lady say?

128
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:39,410
She said you can go in.

129
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,530
Shao Xin, if I were you, I wouldn't try to meet her.

130
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:49,960
This is the last time.

131
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:54,970
After this, I will never step foot back in Green Hill.

132
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:02,000
Great Lady.

133
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,720
Great Lady.

134
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,050
Go play with Ah Li.

135
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,530
Young Highness, come.

136
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:22,160
You must've made up your mind if you're here.

137
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,590
Monarch Ye Hua isn't an outsider.

138
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:32,230
Just speak.

139
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,560
Great Lady,

140
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:40,230
can you save my son, Yuan Zhen?

141
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,430
Save your son?

142
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,410
A few days ago, at the Heavenly Tribe's banquet,

143
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,460
His Highness brought Yuan Zhen to celebrate.

144
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,760
They headed towards the Nine Heavens to congratulate Heavenly Monarch on his birthday.

145
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,810
Who knew...

146
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:58,590
Yuan Zhen broke into Pure Wutong Palace at night and almost...

147
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:02,670
almost took advantage of Consort Su Jin.

148
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,040
Took advantage of Su Jin?

149
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,630
Not just ordinary people can be the crown prince.

150
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:18,790
He even seems to be very happy for his wife to cheat on him.

151
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:24,560
However, at the last moment, Yuan Zhen stopped himself.

152
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,740
But it has angered the Heavenly Monarch.

153
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,460
The Heavenly Monarch was furious

154
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,560
and immediately tied up Yuan Zhen,

155
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,250
and gave an order to punish him to spend 60 years in the Mortal Realm.

156
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,950
Afterward, he's to become a minor immortal.

157
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:43,970
This punishment is indeed too severe for his crime.

158
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:46,330
Yuan Zhen is a kindhearted child.

159
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:49,720
He wouldn't even dare step on an ant.

160
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,810
Please save him, Great Lady.

161
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:59,310
But he took advantage of Monarch Ye Hua's side consort.

162
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,700
No need to spare my feelings.

163
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,540
I also think Yuan Zhen's punishment is too harsh.

164
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,380
The person he took advantage of is your side consort.

165
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,310
I don't have a side consort.

166
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,040
Since Your Highness the Crown Prince thinks it's a harsh punishment,

167
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,710
please save him, Great Lady.

168
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,920
He's just in the Mortal Realm to experience tribulation.

169
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,620
He'll be back after 60 years.

170
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,300
Why do I need to save him?

171
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:33,320
Because I heard Yuan Zhen is to go through a tragic tribulation when he turns 18.

172
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,710
This tribulation would make his entire life miserable.

173
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:40,360
I cannot bear to watch him undergo such torture.

174
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,350
So please help him through this tribulation

175
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:47,620
and let him spend his days peacefully.

176
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:53,880
So, you're here to help your son pass the tribulation?

177
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,710
Yes.

178
00:11:55,710 --> 00:12:00,860
I don't dare to ask you to ask for this punishment to be removed.

179
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:05,270
I'm begging you to help Yuan Zhen behind the scenes.

180
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:11,740
You were very smart in asking me to help you with this.

181
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,680
It is because you know that even if I change Yuan Zhen's fate,

182
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,670
Heavenly Monarch won't argue with me.

183
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:22,550
I know amongst all the realms,

184
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:25,650
only you can do this.

185
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,950
Sure. I promise you.

186
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,460
I'll do this for you.

187
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:37,430
But after this, our relationship of master and servant is over.

188
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,740
You have no relations with me.

189
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,100
I, Shao Xin,

190
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,150
thank your benevolence.

191
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,130
What's wrong?

192
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,730
Are you getting bullied by those little immortals again?

193
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:21,270
They're making fun of me for being a snake.

194
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:24,420
Saying that I'm not fit to serve the monarchess of Green Hill.

195
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,880
You have no guts.

196
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:32,330
If anyone bullied me when I was young, I'd beat them all up.

197
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:40,170
This is the Cloud-Breaking Fan.

198
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,540
It was given to me by the Lord of Lingbao.

199
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,300
I'm giving it to you.

200
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,860
It was from Lord of Lingbao?

201
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,070
That's too valuable. I can't take it.

202
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:52,000
Just take it.

203
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,080
You have been together with me for so long, yet I have never given you any weapons.

204
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,130
This fan is strong.

205
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:02,120
If anyone bullies you, use the fan to blow them out of Green Hill.

206
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,710
Is this fan that strong?

207
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,580
Yup! It's yours now.

208
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,750
Thank you, Great Lady.

209
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:10,240
Great Lady, just now you said that Shao Xin was very clever to ask you?

210
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,040
You were eavesdropping?

211
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,240
I wanted to see what this ungrateful person,

212
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,390
who caused you to become the laughing stock of the Four Seas,

213
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:25,420
shamelessly wanted from you.

214
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,880
In the Nine Heavens,

215
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:33,990
as long as you are an immortal, you have the ability to manipulate the fate of mortals.

216
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:36,230
But the Heavenly Tribe has a rule.

217
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:40,650
That is, even if you have this ability, you cannot use it.

218
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:45,700
But the Heavenly Tribe owes our Bai family too much, and they have not returned a single cent.

219
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,900
If I were to step out and interfere,

220
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:52,870
the Heavenly Monarch will just turn a blind eye since it is such a small matter.

221
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:56,650
So, the best person for this job is me.

222
00:15:56,650 --> 00:16:00,660
This snake is devious.

223
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:04,670
It's good that she's smart.

224
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:07,320
At least she won't be bullied in Northern Sea.

225
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:12,120
It's an easy job and it'll cleanly finish our relationship after I'm done.

226
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:21,370
Seems like I need to go find Emperor Dong Hua's subordinate, Star Monarch Si Ming.

227
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:24,310
I need to see what tribulation Yuan Zhen will face when he's 18.

228
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:28,860
Which hour and which day, and how it will affect the people.

229
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,780
Star Monarch Si Ming has a strange temper.

230
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:35,810
Not even the Heavenly Monarch can borrow his Book of Fate to read.

231
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:39,980
If you plan to use him, you might run into trouble.

232
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,560
What should I do?

233
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:49,930
Luckily for you, Star Monarch Si Ming owes me a favor.

234
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:53,410
It'll be easier if I go ask for you.

235
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:57,810
Really? You can help me?

236
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,470
You have to promise me one thing.

237
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,850
What is it?

238
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,900
When you enter the mortal realm, seal off your magic.

239
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,940
Seal off my magic?

240
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,620
Changing the fate of mortals is something that goes against Heaven.

241
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:14,440
With how much magic you use to change fate, your body will suffer the same amount of recoil.

242
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,690
Qian Qian, although you are a high goddess,

243
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:22,150
you could still be severely affected after being hit a few times by your own magic.

244
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:27,220
What if we have to eventually ascend the thrones of Heavenly Monarch and Heavenly Monarchess?

245
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:31,170
Ascend the throne of Heavenly Monarchess?

246
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,130
Did you forget?

247
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:37,330
You're going to marry into Pure Wutong Palace someday.

248
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:44,830
When we ascend the throne, we have to suffer eighty-one sets of uncultivated fire and nine sets of heavenly lightning.

249
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:49,150
If you suffer from the magic recoil, I'm afraid you won't be able to keep your life.

250
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:55,600
Fine. I promise you.

251
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:59,960
But the two of us are not married.

252
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,190
If you have to ascend the throne any time soon,

253
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,690
I will not be able to marry you in time.

254
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:09,900
So we need not talk about the eighty-one sets of uncultivated fire and nine sets of heavenly lightning.

255
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:16,570
What? Am I wrong?

256
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,900
Qian Qian,

257
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:23,150
are you blaming me for not proposing marriage earlier?

258
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,670
If I married you 300 years ago,

259
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:28,210
we wouldn't have this worry today.

260
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:33,130
I'm just casually saying.

261
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:36,770
It's getting late.

262
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:40,860
Monarch Ye Hua, why don't you help me finish this task earlier?

263
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,820
Then, I can help Yuan Zhen to overcome his tribulation.

264
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:58,240
Your Highness the Crown Prince, why did you want to read Yuan Zhen's fate?

265
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,690
High Goddess Bai Qian promised Second Uncle's wife to help Yuan Zhen with the tribulation.

266
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:04,090
I see.

267
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:06,730
Great Lady is loyal and kind.

268
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:11,710
She doesn't dispute that snake for taking away Second Highness 300 years ago...

269
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,940
Let me tell you about Yuan Zhen's story in the Mortal Realm.

270
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,430
Okay.

271
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:26,170
Yuan Zhen was reincarnated into a royal family.

272
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,510
The family name is Song.

273
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,660
His name is Song Yuanzhen.

274
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:32,890
He was conferred as the crown prince at the age of 12.

275
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:35,530
He's almost eighteen years old now.

276
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:37,640
His tribulation is about to commence.

277
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:44,160
Yuan Zhen's mother, in the Mortal Realm, is a noble consort.

278
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,910
After giving birth to him, she brought him to a Daoist temple and became a nun.

279
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:54,080
When he was sixteen years old, she allowed his teacher to send him back to the palace.

280
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:04,250
And Yuan Zhen's teacher is a maidservant sent by Water Monarch Sang Ji to protect him in the Mortal Realm.

281
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,710
Maidservant?

282
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,160
So, Second Uncle still secretly sent someone to protect him?

283
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,710
That's right.

284
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:17,840
In my opinion, if Great Lady doesn't want to mess up his fate,

285
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,710
she needs to replace his teacher and stay by Yuan Zhen's side.

286
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,630
This is the only solution.

287
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:32,930
As for how to help him pass his tribulation, she will have to consider it at length.

288
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,250
Thank you.

289
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,820
You are most welcome, Your Highness the Crown Prince.

290
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:55,100
It was Your Highness who pardoned Bai Fengjiu for Emperor Dong Hua's sake for stealing the Soul-Gathering Lamp.

291
00:20:55,100 --> 00:21:00,220
You could say I'm returning the favor for the Emperor today.

292
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:03,100
You just have to remind Great Lady that

293
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:06,540
when she's in the Mortal Realm, she must seal off her powers.

294
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,890
Or else...

295
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,650
I understand.

296
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:31,570
You're saying that the nine-tailed fox is going to the Mortal Realm to help Yuan Zhen with his tribulation?

297
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:35,860
Yes. That is what His Highness and the Star Monarch said.

298
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:41,520
They also said that Bai Qian must seal off her powers in the Mortal Realm.

299
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:52,250
Younger Sister Miao Qing, I'm going to have to ask you to go to the Mortal Realm, too.

300
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,940
Me?

301
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,000
Based on principle, I'm the older sister

302
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,210
so I should be taking the risks.

303
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:09,600
But as His Highness' side consort,

304
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,610
every move I make is under scrutiny by everyone.

305
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:15,000
I truly do not dare to make any rash moves.

306
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,340
But you can move around easily.

307
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:24,140
What do you need me to do?

308
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,930
I heard you saying how precious and cherished this book is.

309
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:37,050
I thought you would only get a copy.

310
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:39,520
I didn't expect you to come back with the original.

311
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,330
Take a look.

312
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:45,500
Si Ming wrote a story that really makes one want to tear up.

313
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:51,260
It's really a waste of Monarch Si Ming's talent if he doesn't write a few plays.

314
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,460
On the first day of the sixth month, the emperor will visit the Shuyu River.

315
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,510
Crown Prince Yuanzhen will also go along.

316
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:20,050
A roc bird will appear at the river and scare everyone into a panic.

317
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:22,950
A beautiful woman will accidentally fall into the river.

318
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:25,540
Yuanzhen will jump into the river to save her.

319
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:28,500
So, this tribulation is the test of a beautiful woman?

320
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,990
Yuanzhen and that woman fall in love with each other in the water;

321
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:36,720
but unfortunately, the emperor also takes a liking for that woman.

322
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,200
He takes her back to the palace and she becomes his favorite.

323
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,860
This emperor sure is affectionate.

324
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,930
Yuanzhen cannot accept losing the love of his life,

325
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:51,090
and on a certain drunken night, he and the beauty met in a secluded spot.

326
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:54,680
Not long after, the beauty gives birth to a prince.

327
00:23:54,680 --> 00:24:00,590
So, Yuanzhen steals his father's woman in the Mortal Realm?

328
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,380
That's right.

329
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:06,960
The prince is naturally Yuanzhen's son, but Yuanzhen doesn't know it.

330
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:12,010
A dozen years later, after the emperor falls ill, the prince fights with Yuanzhen for the crown prince position.

331
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:14,330
In the end, Yuanzhen kills the prince.

332
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:18,590
The grievance news relays to the beauty who then hangs herself.

333
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:22,200
Before her death, she writes a letter to Yuanzhen telling him the truth.

334
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,600
After reading it, Yuanzhen was inconsolable with grief and wishes to cut his own throat.

335
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,850
However, he was the only male heir to the imperial family,

336
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:31,780
he had no choice but to reluctantly take the throne.

337
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:37,080
And just like that, he ruled until 60 years old and dies from old age, having lived a miserable life.

338
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,550
What a tempestuous fate.

339
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:45,240
Yuanzhen's life is truly legendary.

340
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:52,530
So at 18 years old, the moment he sees the beauty fall into the water, is the turning point of his life.

341
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:56,650
As long as he doesn't save that beauty, he'll have a smooth life.

342
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:58,190
That's right.

343
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:02,190
Looks like I need to live in the Mortal Realm for six months.

344
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:06,220
I'll wait until the first of the sixth month and stop him from saving that beauty.

345
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,100
I've already paid preparations for you.

346
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,950
After you arrive in the Mortal Realm, Yuanzhen's Daoist teacher will refer you to the palace,

347
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:14,670
you'll be Yuanzhen's new teacher.

348
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:17,020
I'm going to be a Daoist nun?

349
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,490
That's right.

350
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:28,120
- Senior Sister.
- Junior Sister.

351
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:32,340
Your Highness the Crown Prince, my time with you has come to an end.

352
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,260
I should leave.

353
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,380
Teacher...

354
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:40,200
It's just that, as your teacher,

355
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,190
I feel like I'm letting you down by leaving so suddenly.

356
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:50,350
Fortunately, my senior sister who wanders the world happens to be here.

357
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:53,960
I asked my senior sister to look after you in my place.

358
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,630
She has not left the temple grounds for hundreds of years,

359
00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:04,240
so to call her your teacher is Your Highness's good fortune.

360
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:09,750
But...I can't bear for you to leave me.

361
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:14,930
The fate of meeting and parting is not up to us, Your Highness.

362
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:18,300
I understand,

363
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,800
but...

364
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:24,580
Thank you, Daoist Priest, for taking care of Yuanzhen for the past years.

365
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,260
Noble Consort, you are too polite.

366
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,370
Hurry and greet my senior.

367
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:32,140
Yuanzhen, pay your respects to the Daoist priest immediately.

368
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:37,060
Daoist Priest.

369
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,400
Not bad.

370
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,790
Daoist Priest, you mean...?

371
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:50,560
I can tell from a glance, Your Highness the Crown Prince is among the ranks of immortals from the Nine Heavens.

372
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:54,720
He's committed a crime so he descended to the Mortal Realm for a tribulation.

373
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,120
Will my son return to the ranks of immortals once he completes his trials?

374
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:02,550
If I properly guide and enlighten him,

375
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,750
and His Highness the Crown Prince is sincerely devoted to Daoist practice,

376
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,650
I believe it won't be difficult for him to return to the ranks of immortals.

377
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:10,230
Quick, call her "Teacher" now.

378
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,420
Teacher.

379
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:31,390
Teacher, if you don't mind, this will be your residence from now on.

380
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:34,230
It's not bad. Go back now.

381
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:37,160
Come back tomorrow to study Daoism from me.

382
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,720
Yes.

383
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,760
It's only the first day of the first month.

384
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,920
Do I really have to live here for half a year, until the beauty falls into the Shuyu River?

385
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:18,660
But that's fine, I can observe how the Royal Family in the Mortal Realm spends their days.

386
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:29,240
High Immortal.

387
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,930
You spoke very rudely at the Eastern Seas,

388
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:35,660
and now you are bowing your head to Kunlun Void?

389
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,670
I'm here to see High Immortal Si Yin.

390
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:39,270
What did you say?

391
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:42,170
You want to see Si Yin?

392
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:45,100
70,000 years ago, because of the war with your Winged Realm,

393
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,730
my teacher died at war and Si Yin disappeared as well.

394
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:52,610
How dare you have the nerve to say you want to see him?

395
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:55,600
High Immortal, a few days ago, I saw Si Yin.

396
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,490
I thought that since Si Yin was deeply attached to Kunlun Void,

397
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:04,030
if she's back, she'll come back here.

398
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:06,380
What?! You met him? Where?!

399
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:09,860
On the northern banks of the Eastern Seas, within the borders of the Northern Wilderness.

400
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,680
Northern Wilderness?

401
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,710
Please go back.

402
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:20,470
Although Kunlun Void isn't an enemy of the Winged Realm for the sake of the Heavenly Tribe,

403
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:23,770
we still have no relationship with you.

404
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:27,270
As for Si Yin, my fellow disciples and I will continue searching for him.

405
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:29,990
You need not trouble yourself, Winged Monarch. See yourself out.

406
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:31,880
High Immortal, please wait.

407
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,090
What is the use of asking him?

408
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:44,420
Since Ah Yin is purposely hiding her identity,

409
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:49,080
how would people form Kunlun Void know?

410
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:57,490
- Fire Kirin.
- Mighty Monarch.

411
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:00,160
- We'll return to Grand Purple Palace.
- Yes.

412
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:02,790
Mighty Monarch.

413
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,460
I've been investigating the Winged Realms's situation recently.

414
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:15,500
I've encountered many from the Winged Realm traveling in disguise to various regions, looking for High Immortal Si Yin.

415
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,700
They all carry this drawing.

416
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:22,790
I heard this drawing was drawn by the Winged Monarch Li Jing himself.

417
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:25,600
The rest are all copies.

418
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:32,570
There was word from Sixteenth Junior Brother just now. The Winged Monarch had visited Kunlun Void today.

419
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:37,940
He said he'd seen Si Yin, so he went to Kunlun Void to check if Si Yin had returned.

420
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:42,560
I've been searching for Seventeenth Junior Brother for 70,000 years without a clue.

421
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,480
How could he have seen him?

422
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,750
It is clearly another lie.

423
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,690
High Immortal Die Feng,

424
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:55,440
is the person in the drawing really High Immortal Si Yin?

425
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,560
Yes, this is Seventeenth Junior Brother.

426
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:05,950
You just said Winged Monarch Li Jing had seen Si Yin?

427
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:08,950
Yes, that's what Li Jing said to my junior brother, Zi Lan.

428
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,430
Did he say where?

429
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:13,110
On the northern bank of the Eastern Sea.

430
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:20,080
Northern bank of the Eastern Sea?

431
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:23,050
It is indeed the Eastern Sea.

432
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:28,710
Kunlun Void's seventeenth disciple, Si Yin, and Mo Yuan's body have been missing for 70,000 years.

433
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:32,670
This is the Heavenly Tribe's biggest unresolved case. I never thought that...

434
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:36,820
Qian Qian, you are High Immortal Si Yin.

435
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:39,750
Does Your Highness have a lead?

436
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,940
None.

437
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:45,410
I have merely heard of what happened to High Immortal Si Yin.

438
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:49,700
Seeing this drawing has reminded me of the great war 70,000 years ago.

439
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,180
You may leave.

440
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,720
Yes.

441
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:05,500
Why did she take Mo Yuan's body?

442
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,350
Why did she disappear?

443
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:10,180
You even avoid your fellow disciples.

444
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,750
Qian Qian, if I were to ask you,

445
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:17,200
would you tell me the truth?

446
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:34,270
Good boy. You are such a good boy, Ying'er.

447
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,750
- Mighty Monarch.
- You may go.

448
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:41,050
- Yes.
- Yes.

449
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:46,470
Mighty Monarch. Look, he's such a good boy.

450
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:48,270
Doesn't cry or make a fuss.

451
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,230
Stop fooling around.

452
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:54,160
It's been 300 years, why have you not come to your senses?

453
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:58,610
It's because you stole the battle formation, that's why our child is born sickly.

454
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:07,800
Mighty Monarch, I've already found a way to wake him up.

455
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:11,690
Mighty Monarch, as long as Ying'er wakes up,

456
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:14,830
that means that I can birth healthy children.

457
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:19,570
Then I'll bear more princes for you,

458
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:21,130
and a little princess.

459
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:23,520
Don't you miss Yan Zhi the most?

460
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,360
I'll give birth to a few princesses for you.

461
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,150
Wouldn't that be nice?

462
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:34,420
Since things have turned out like this, why don't you just let it go?

463
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:39,090
Let me ask you.

464
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,370
Who exactly is Si Yin?

465
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,840
It's been 70,000 years,

466
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,800
you're still thinking about that man?

467
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:05,490
Don't you know, he's just like you, a woman of the Fox Tribe?

468
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,810
A woman of the Fox Tribe?

469
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,980
Impossible.

470
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:19,780
I've seen him get dressed with my own eyes at Kunlun Void.

471
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:22,340
He is a man of the Heavenly Tribe.

472
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:24,790
Mighty Monarch, you were once with him.

473
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:27,800
How could you not know he is a man from the Heavenly Tribe?

474
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,620
I knew long ago that she was a woman,

475
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:34,790
but she never told me she was from the fox tribe, and not the Heavenly Tribe.

476
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,510
Fox Tribe?

477
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:40,390
A woman from the Fox Tribe?

478
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:47,100
Did you think of something?

479
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,930
I don't believe that she is a woman from the Fox Tribe.

480
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:53,440
Mighty Monarch, stop fooling yourself.

481
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,550
Do you really not know?

482
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,560
You're such a good boy, Ying'er.

483
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:12,900
As long as you listen to me, son, I will definitely wake you up.

484
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,230
Qian Qian,

485
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,780
so it was you.

486
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:35,880
I never would have guessed that Si Yin was you.

487
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:40,560
Why does the man that I love the most, keep thinking about you?

488
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,650
You already have Mo Yuan.

489
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:45,630
Why are you stealing Li Jing from me?

490
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,330
Mo Yuan?

491
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:54,700
Why have I never thought of it?

492
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:58,080
Mo Yuan.

493
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:34,530
- Look at this. This is a fresh jade dew made from gathering early morning dew.
- Great Lady.

494
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:36,750
Smell it. So fragrant.

495
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,790
Come, look!

496
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:45,550
Great Lady, good morning!

497
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:47,560
Great Lady, you're back!

498
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,970
- Didn't you say you were going to the Mortal Realm?
- Yes. You're back so soon.

499
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:53,210
Turns out Bai Qian isn't here.

500
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:55,450
I've been blessed.

501
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:58,180
One day here is a year in the Mortal Realm.

502
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:02,120
I think it's been fast, but it's been months down there.

503
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:07,360
That's right. You told us this morning you were going for half a year at least, and a year at most.

504
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,060
You wanted us to keep the loquat for you to pick up tomorrow.

505
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,400
Here. Do you want me to bring it to the fox den later?

506
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,770
No need. I'll take it.

507
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:20,100
Thank you.

508
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,390
Great Lady is so strange today.

509
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:26,220
- That's right.
- She is too strange.

510
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:35,680
Mother you're back!

511
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,530
- Great Lady.
- Mother!

512
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:41,460
What did you just call me?

513
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:45,350
Didn't you say you're leaving Green Hill for a day?

514
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:48,410
Why are you back so soon?

515
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:54,120
Because I missed you.

516
00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:01,720
Didn't you say you were going to the Mortal Realm for at least a day?

517
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:06,630
It's boring down there so I'm back early.

518
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,610
Boring?

519
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,260
What?

520
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:15,710
Weren't you going to help Shao Xin's son with his tribulation?

521
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:20,620
It's because the tribulation was too easy

522
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,950
that I'm back early.

523
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:26,450
Come inside with me, okay?

524
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:28,270
Sure.

525
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,850
Let's go.

526
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,740
Good son.

527
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,600
Although Great Lady does dote on Young Highness,

528
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:41,890
she knows the rules of the Heavenly Tribe and never calls him her son.

529
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:45,880
She's acting strange today.

530
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:56,940
All right. Bring High God Mo Yuan here.

531
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:59,680
Great Lady, did you forget?

532
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,450
Forget what?

533
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:07,630
Aren't you afraid that His Highness the Crown Prince will find him,

534
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:11,440
so you blocked off the Splendid Flame Cave?

535
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:16,330
That's right. The Splendid Flame Cave.

536
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:18,600
Let's go there now.

537
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,730
Son, wait for me.

538
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:22,350
Yes.

539
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:56,220
You're really here.

540
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,720
You're not Great Lady!

541
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,680
Mi Gu, don't joke.

542
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,900
Great Lady always greets High God Mo Yuan before seeing him.

543
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,960
You're not Great Lady! You're Xuan Nü!

544
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:11,780
You traitor! You still dare come here?!

545
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:39,520
Great Lady!

546
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,740
No.

547
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,380
Great Lady, what are your orders?

548
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:55,090
Bring Young Highness here.

549
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:57,040
Yes.

550
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:19,230
What if I save the beauty when she falls in the water?

551
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:25,690
I can't. It'll be more troublesome if she falls in love with me.

552
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:36,810
Qian Qian, I've missed you so much in these past few days.

553
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:38,750
Do you miss me?

554
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:46,860
I'm here to tell you some important news.

555
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:51,390
Do you know who reincarnated as Yuanzhen's father here?

556
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:22,640
”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

557
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,720
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

558
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,050
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

559
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:32,610
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

560
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:41,920
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

561
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,970
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

562
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:51,300
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

563
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:57,000
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

564
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:03,380
♫ All are just illusions ♫

565
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:10,300
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

566
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:15,510
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

567
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:19,970
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

568
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:26,020
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

569
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:31,530
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

570
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:36,760
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

571
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,630
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

572
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:48,770
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from my previous life ♫

573
00:43:55,530 --> 00:44:00,670
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

574
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:06,290
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

575
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:10,630
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

576
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:16,800
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

577
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:22,090
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

578
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:27,480
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

579
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:30,290
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

580
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:39,530
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

581
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:51,590
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
