”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

2
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,510
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:21,070
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:24,640
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,990
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,370
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:35,220
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,770
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:42,360
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,910
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:49,380
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,970
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:56,380
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:00,070
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:03,560
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,120
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,540
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:14,150
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,000
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,760
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,210
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,450
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,780
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,830
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,390
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:38,310
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,080
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,640
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

[Eternal Love]

30
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:13,120
[Episode 53]

31
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,280
Your Majesty.

32
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,450
Jiu'er.

33
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:40,570
I'm very happy that you carried me back here.

34
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:44,630
But you're soaking wet,

35
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,550
it makes me sad.

36
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,970
In the future...

37
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:56,770
we'll wait until the rain stops and then we'll go back, all right?

38
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,170
All right.

39
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,420
That's not real.

40
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,300
What is not real?

41
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,200
It's not real when I called you "Your Majesty."

42
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,400
You are the emperor.

43
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,160
Emperor Dong Hua.

44
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,470
You look better like this.

45
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:51,250
The way you looked in the Mortal Realm was somewhat ugly.

46
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,810
Really?

47
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,880
Could I be ugly?

48
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,490
I was just teasing you.

49
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:09,330
You look good in whatever form.

50
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:14,450
♫ I’ve liked you for a long time, ever since the moment we met ♫

51
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,600
Because of you,

52
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,370
I even cut off my tail.

53
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:23,240
♫ In the bonds of this world, I really hope time can stop ♫

54
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,420
In my dream...

55
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,810
♫ The pain of leaving you is like an arrow in my heart ♫

56
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,060
...shouldn't you repay me in my dream?

57
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:39,990
♫ In my memories, my tears drench the light breeze ♫

58
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:47,130
♫ Even if we do not end up together, and I cannot express my true feelings ♫

59
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:58,370
♫ My yearnings will still coat the moonlight and merge into the warmth of my tears ♫

60
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:16,310
♫ The moment I fell for you, even if I am like a moth
chasing fire ♫

61
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:23,670
♫ I will still courageously endure the pain and deeply love you ♫

62
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:30,950
Don't tell her that I was here.

63
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:38,140
♫ My yearnings will still coat the moonlight and merge into the warmth of my tears ♫

64
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:44,970
♫ Perhaps the moment I fell in love with you is destined to no result ♫

65
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:58,710
♫ Even so, I will persevere in my love for you without
complaints ♫

66
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:14,410
Last night, it was really just a dream.

67
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,860
You're awake, you silly girl.

68
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:25,500
Don't act foolishly again, okay?

69
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,660
You even cut off your own tail.

70
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,720
Luckily, we have Zhe Yan.

71
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,910
Otherwise, you would be the only eight-tailed little fox in our Green Hill Tribe.

72
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:44,920
My father told me once that the tails of a nine-tailed fox can do many things.

73
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,510
Therefore I wanted to try,

74
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:53,140
and see if I could carve my name and Emperor Dong Hua's name on the Three Lives Stone.

75
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,980
I've said all I should say.

76
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,910
Now there's nothing more I can say, except to sigh.

77
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,210
Aunt, do you know who I dreamed of last night?

78
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:14,680
It definitely wasn't me, right?

79
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,750
Right.

80
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:24,890
Today, I'll have Mi Gu accompany you back to the fox den for your recovery.

81
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:27,970
Once I have completed refining the medicinal pills for Teacher to go into seclusion,

82
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:31,190
I will go back and keep you company. Okay?

83
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:35,360
You are not allowed to do anything foolish again.

84
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,330
Aunt, don't worry.

85
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:42,050
Cutting off a tail is just like dying.

86
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:46,020
There are certain matters which I can only understood later.

87
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,030
Suddenly looking down on him?

88
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:52,200
No.

89
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,700
There's ample time.

90
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,430
I will definitely find a solution.

91
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,790
Xin Nu.

92
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:24,710
Look. Does this resemble her?

93
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:31,770
Yes. It's ninety percent in resemblance now.

94
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,090
My Lady.

95
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:04,660
I used my spell to create this.

96
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,070
It won't last long before it disappears.

97
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:11,870
It's different from when Ye Hua used the Soul-Gathering Lamp.

98
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:18,470
My Lady, you spent many days to create this.

99
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:21,040
How are you using it?

100
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,880
Let her experience the tribulation with Mighty Monarch in the Mortal Realm.

101
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:32,810
My Lady, are you saying that, you want her to go to the Mortal Realm... to be with Mighty Monarch?

102
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:42,430
Didn't I tell you that Bai Qian and I are similar?

103
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:45,590
The biggest flaw is that we love Ye Hua.

104
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:48,420
If we love Ye Hua, there will definitely be jealousy.

105
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:52,660
Just like when I was jealous over Su Su and Ye Hua.

106
00:09:54,300 --> 00:10:00,730
I want Bai Qian to know that she's just a substitute for Su Su.

107
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,170
So what if she's the High Goddess from Green Hill?

108
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:09,220
After all, she's just a substitute for a dead mortal's body.

109
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:13,840
There's no difference between her and this wooden figure.

110
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:19,710
My Lady, you want to dress her up like Su Su and keep her by Mighty Monarch's side.

111
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:23,010
And make Bai Qian suffer.

112
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:25,050
That's right.

113
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:29,610
When I first took offense to Su Su, it will be even more so for Bai Qian.

114
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:33,150
This has nothing to do with being a high goddess or not.

115
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:44,150
Starting from today, guard this woman daily.

116
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:49,360
If you see High Goddess Bai Qian visiting Mighty Monarch, report to me immediately.

117
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,220
Yes.

118
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,050
Lift up your head. Let me look at you.

119
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,610
That woman is not so gentle and warm like you.

120
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,200
She has a very strong personality.

121
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,850
But it's okay.

122
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:32,720
Mighty Monarch in the Mortal Realm has lost all his memories.

123
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,630
He will not remember that mortal person.

124
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:43,270
Starting from today, your name is Su Su.

125
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,190
Yes.

126
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:57,730
Congratulations.

127
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:00,020
This is a big event!

128
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,650
He's here!

129
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,880
My Young Master took first place in the Imperial examination.

130
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,550
Excellent! Congratulations.

131
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,680
My Young Master is distributing Happiness Cake. Everyone, come and take one.

132
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,150
Excellent! Congratulations!

133
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:14,870
Thank you, Young Master. Thank you, Young Master.

134
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,310
Thank you, Young Master.

135
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,920
You are here.

136
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,710
Official, did you recognize the wrong person?

137
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,170
No.

138
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,260
Although you look like her, you are not her.

139
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,300
Official,

140
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:49,920
could you be kind and buy me?

141
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:56,720
I'm in need of money to bury my father now.

142
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,540
Since I look like that woman of yours,

143
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:06,560
could you take this into account and help me?

144
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,310
Young Master, let's go back.

145
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,590
There are lots of such women in the street.

146
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,920
Official!

147
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,310
Take this.

148
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,650
Thank you, Official.

149
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,140
Do you have anyone else in your family?

150
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,720
No.

151
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,340
There is no one else.

152
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:42,950
After you have buried your father, come to my residence.

153
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:45,230
- Really?
- Of course.

154
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:48,410
My young master is the top scorer in the imperial examination. He wouldn't lie to you.

155
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:51,350
Thank you, Official.

156
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,640
You have been in the Pellet-Cultivating Room for six days.

157
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,540
Are you bored?

158
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,480
How could I be bored refining a medicinal pill for Master?

159
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,520
Sixteenth Disciple Brother,

160
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:20,890
do you still remember when we became Teacher's disciples?

161
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,730
How could I forget that?

162
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:27,160
We both stepped into the hall and wanted to become Teacher's disciples at the same time.

163
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,890
In order to be the sixteenth and seventeenth disciples, we fought like crazy.

164
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,500
Talking about this, Teacher was really prejudiced.

165
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:39,450
He made me a senior brother of yours, but he gave the newly cultivated Kunlun Fan of Yuqing to you instead.

166
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:42,060
You are really lucky.

167
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,310
You still say that?

168
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:47,840
Because of that fan, I had to call you the 90,000 years senior brother.

169
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,400
You should think that you are lucky instead.

170
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,610
Seventeenth.

171
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,720
Nothing.

172
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:01,970
What's wrong? Wanted to say something but are reluctant?

173
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:04,530
You seem to have lost your heart.

174
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,600
What are you talking about?

175
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,720
I'm a heartless person.

176
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,740
How could I have such moments?

177
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,370
Yes, you are such a heartless person.

178
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:18,710
How could you have left your heart with someone else?

179
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:24,300
Sixteenth Senior Brother.

180
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:37,190
Sixteenth Senior Brother! You... get up.

181
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:40,370
Are you okay? What's wrong with you?

182
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,400
You are definitely a high goddess.

183
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,380
Your blow is formidable.

184
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,520
I almost died on the spot.

185
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,260
I was only joking with you.

186
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:56,760
Moreover, your cultivation wasn't that low 70,000 years ago.

187
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,990
Even if you slacked off for the past 70,000 years, it shouldn't be like this.

188
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:03,310
What happened?

189
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,140
None of your business.

190
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:09,690
Fine.

191
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:13,060
If you don't want to tell me, so be it then.

192
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:19,120
But I'm guessing, it must be a helpless love.

193
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,150
You really hit the mark.

194
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:30,800
Is she... pretty?

195
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,920
She's prettier than you.

196
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,860
Really?

197
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:43,270
In my heart, she's thousands of times better looking than you.

198
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,150
I'm not talking to you anymore.

199
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,360
Teacher is going into seclusion tomorrow.

200
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,000
All senior brothers are going back to their jobs.

201
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,300
Sixteenth Senior Brother, what about you? Where do you plan to go?

202
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,900
I'm going to the Sea of Innocence.

203
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,720
Sea of Innocence?

204
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,180
Isn't that the holy burial place for the Heavenly Tribe?

205
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,340
Why are you going there?

206
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:10,850
What else could it be? Of course, I'll live there to guard the tombs for the Heavenly Tribe for the rest of my life,

207
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:12,780
What else could it be? Of course, I'll live there to guard the tombs for the Heavenly Tribe for the rest of my life,

208
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:17,120
till my soul disperses and I return to a formless mass.

209
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,880
Stop joking.

210
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,460
What's so great about guarding tombs?

211
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:26,100
You don't understand.

212
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:32,970
When one has nothing else to ask for, it's all the same whatever you want him to do.

213
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:38,160
To add further, this was a vow I made to God.

214
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:46,020
If he fulfilled my wish at that time, I would spend the rest of my life at the Sea of Innocence.

215
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:50,160
Senior Brother...

216
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,050
Don't ask. Even if you do, I won't tell you.

217
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,810
Teacher, I was wrong.

218
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:23,890
After drinking a lot, it's good to cry it out.

219
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:28,320
Or else, if your depression affects your inner organs, it would be a waste for these good wines.

220
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,970
Teacher, these are the medicinal pills refined by Zhe Yan.

221
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:19,140
Teacher, bring it with you into the cave.

222
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:33,100
Teacher, do you have any further instructions?

223
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:39,160
When's the wedding for you and Ye Hua?

224
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,010
In October, during Indian summer when all the peach flowers are blossoming.

225
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:44,680
It will be a good time.

226
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:52,450
Seventeenth, once you enter the Heavenly Palace, you will become Crown Prince's person.

227
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,740
The Heavenly Palace is not Kunlun Void.

228
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,810
There are a lot of complicated etiquettes and rules.

229
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:03,110
You must remember to control your temper and not cause trouble again.

230
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,880
When I was in Kunlun Void, I kept causing trouble.

231
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,450
You were always the one who'd fix them for me.

232
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:12,250
I knew about this.

233
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,970
I have always kept this in my heart.

234
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,180
Teacher, just be at ease and go into seclusion.

235
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:21,630
Ye Hua will take good care of me from now on.

236
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:24,710
He surely won't let me cause trouble again.

237
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:27,330
I'll wait for your early return from seclusion.

238
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,550
It'll be better if you can attend our wedding.

239
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:35,250
By then, I will surely bow to you and offer you a tea.

240
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,240
Fine.

241
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:42,080
Then... Teacher, I'm taking my leave first.

242
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,090
All right.

243
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,200
Just walk me until here.

244
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,470
Junior Brother, why must you make things difficult for yourself like this?

245
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:16,750
I'm a member of Kunlun Void, the disciple of Mo Yuan.

246
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,960
Of course, my words can't be taken back.

247
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,760
Moreover, the Sea of Innocence is a very quiet place.

248
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,550
It's very suitable for me to cultivate there.

249
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,750
Seventeenth, I won't be going to your wedding banquet with the crown prince.

250
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:39,970
However, if you need me to risk my life for you, just come to Sea of Innocence to seek me.

251
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:41,990
Devil's tongue.

252
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:44,780
Our senior brothers have all returned to their posts.

253
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:50,190
I will entrust Kunlun Void to you, Second Senior Brother.

254
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,780
I won't say anything unnecessary anymore.

255
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:57,560
I'm leaving.

256
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,030
Go back now.

257
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,470
Why are you still here?

258
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:29,810
Second Senior Brother, I have some matters to attend, too.

259
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:32,030
I'm leaving the mountain.

260
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:35,220
Seventeenth, you must be missing your lover a lot.

261
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,160
By the way, I have something for you.

262
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:41,600
Before Eldest Senior Brother left early this morning, he asked me to give this Soul-Gathering Lamp to you.

263
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,520
He said that you left it in the Western Sea.

264
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,790
The Soul-Gathering Lamp?

265
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:54,050
If not because Eldest Senior gave it back to me, I would have almost forgot about it.

266
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:55,910
This is, after all, a sacred item of the Heavenly Tribe.

267
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:58,140
I should return it.

268
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:04,050
In this period that Teacher is in seclusion, we have to trouble Second Senior Brother to take care of him.

269
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,050
Look at you, you're becoming courteous.

270
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:09,580
He's not just your teacher, but also my teacher.

271
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:14,990
If there are any problems in Kunlun Void, you must go to Green Hill to find me.

272
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:18,220
I'm leaving first, Second Senior Brother.

273
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:40,820
[Worshiping Ceremony for the Respected and Virtuous]

274
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:44,390
Ye Hua should be eighteen years old now.

275
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:49,260
I don't know what Ye Hua would look like at this age here in the mortal world.

276
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,980
Excuse me, young man.

277
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,580
Is your Young Master in?

278
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,990
Are you referring to our First Young Master?

279
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:01,500
Right. I'm looking for Zhaoge. Is he around?

280
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,120
He's not here. He has relocated.

281
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,620
Isn't this the Liu Manor?

282
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,060
Where would he move?

283
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:11,270
Of course, it's to setup his own manor.

284
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:15,650
He's only 18 and he has set up his own manor?

285
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,990
Our First Young Master is a rare genius of these centuries.

286
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:21,790
At age 12, he was able to enter the Imperial Academy.

287
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,990
Five years ago, the emperor granted a special imperial examination.

288
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:26,840
Young master casually took the exam and got first place.

289
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,290
From being a junior compiler of the Imperial Academy, he had a rapid rise.

290
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:31,890
Now, he's already the Chief Secretary of the Ministry of Revenue.

291
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:33,630
Such unrestrained ingenuity.

292
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:38,620
Miss, if you want to find him, you'll have to go to the Ministry of Revenue now.

293
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:41,770
Ye Hua, you are indeed the crown prince of the Heavenly Tribe.

294
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:45,900
Even in the mortal world, you are extraordinary.

295
00:24:54,890 --> 00:25:01,650
Official, let me give you a toast for the peach blossom tonight.

296
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,400
Sure.

297
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,590
Official, you're coughing more severely.

298
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:23,550
The doctor already said that you should stop over worrying.

299
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:26,220
If not, you will ruin your health.

300
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,840
I'm not worrying.

301
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:32,800
I'm lovesick.

302
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:56,460
After not seeing him for six days, he totally forgot about my love token.

303
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:00,280
He indeed attracted some messy romance to himself.

304
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:15,110
Ye Hua! Ye Hua!

305
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:18,530
Didn't your husband tell you not to leave the bamboo forest?

306
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,830
Ye Hua!

307
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:31,260
It's been so many days since I saw you.

308
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:35,230
High Goddess, greetings.

309
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,820
How did you know that I was here?

310
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,850
High Goddess, you must be confused.

311
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:45,290
The invisibility magic is only a sight deceiving trick.

312
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:49,520
It can trick a mortal's eyes, but not that of an immortal.

313
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,080
While on the clouds, I saw a flash of light over here.

314
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:57,500
I then came down the clouds to look for it and my guess was right.

315
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:01,250
And why are you here?

316
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:05,270
Mighty Monarch is here in the mortal world alone to go through his tribulations.

317
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:07,490
I was worried that he'd be lonely,

318
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:12,310
so I especially created a human puppet of the person that he has thought of so much.

319
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:19,560
I came down today to especially check if this person is taking good care of Mighty Monarch.

320
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:25,740
I wasn't paying attention earlier and didn't notice that this lady was just a human puppet.

321
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:28,690
You really have put quite an effort into it.

322
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:36,140
Do you know whose appearance I based this human puppet from?

323
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:51,130
Have you heard of the name Su Su?

324
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:59,570
Are you talking about Ah Li's mother who jumped off the Immortal Execution Platform?

325
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,700
But High Goddess, no need to feel bothered by it.

326
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,540
Mighty Monarch is just a mortal now.

327
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:09,910
He won't be able to notice that the one sitting in front of him is just a human puppet.

328
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:15,130
It can fulfill his dream in his heart and mind.

329
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:17,710
Once Mighty Monarch returns to his old identity,

330
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:22,500
based on his disposition, even if this puppet has Su Su's face,

331
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,880
he will not give any importance to a puppet.

332
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:33,710
You are clearly telling me that Ye Hua has given this puppet importance.

333
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:40,830
Aren't you afraid that when Ye Hua returns to his original identity,

334
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:45,110
and when he thinks about you deceiving him, he will blame you?

335
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:51,050
I merely created a puppet and placed it on the street in front of his residence.

336
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:55,530
It was Mighty Monarch who saw her and brought her into the residence.

337
00:28:55,530 --> 00:29:01,670
If Might Monarch were to blame me, I have nothing to say then.

338
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:07,950
It's evident that if one likes a person to the point of carving her to one's bone,

339
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:11,410
even if you drink the water from the River of Forgetfulness prepared by Lord of the Netherworld,

340
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:17,420
it will still leave an impression, turn back and fall in love with this person again.

341
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:21,580
You have experience with this.

342
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:25,390
About the deep love that I have for Mighty Monarch,

343
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:28,200
everyone in Nine Heavens knows this very well.

344
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,770
Of course, I have deep experience.

345
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:35,010
By the way, do you know that

346
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:42,040
Mighty Monarch has been using the Soul-Gathering Lamp to form Su Su's breath for three hundred years?

347
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:48,990
Of course, I know about this.

348
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:55,930
Su Jin, among the juniors, you are the most knowledgeable.

349
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:59,930
I can see that the puppet was created in great detail.

350
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:01,980
You have been very diligent.

351
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:06,300
With her taking care of Ye Hua, I will have fewer hassles.

352
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:10,670
When he goes back to his old identity and wants to blame you,

353
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:13,550
I will put in a few good words on your behalf, too.

354
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:18,670
Thank you, High Goddess.

355
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:21,370
I'm taking my leave now.

356
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:51,380
Ye Hua, when I asked you that night whether you remembered me,

357
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,470
you totally didn't have any impression.

358
00:30:53,470 --> 00:31:00,200
Even if you drank the Water of Forgetfulness, you still couldn't forget Ah Li's mortal mother, could you?

359
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,260
Weren't you at Kunlun Void?

360
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,670
Why did you suddenly come here?

361
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:26,940
Fourth Older Brother, do you know Ah Li's mortal mother?

362
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,290
I heard Zhe Yan mention her.

363
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:35,860
When he was in Heavenly Palace, he met her once.

364
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:40,390
He subsequently heard that she passed away young and left Young Heavenly Grandchild behind.

365
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:43,640
What's wrong? You didn't ask Ye Hua about this?

366
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:49,920
Ever since I found out that Ye Hua had loved some mortal,

367
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:53,060
I didn't want to bring this up.

368
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,800
Hence, I didn't ask him.

369
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,260
This person is already gone. Why are you still bothered by this?

370
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:06,320
I also feel that it's meaningless to be angry over a dead person.

371
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,140
What's with that crying face then?

372
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:14,960
Fourth Older Brother,

373
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,080
Ye Hua initially told me that he liked me.

374
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,380
I listened to him when he said that.

375
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:25,260
But I have never thought about why among the many immortal women in the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses,

376
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:28,080
he would fall in love with me.

377
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,040
If it's love, it's love.

378
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:34,470
Love is something that is hard to guess.

379
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:38,060
Emperor Dong Hua distinctly knows that he doesn't have any fate with Fengjiu.

380
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:41,600
Why did he still insist on getting involved with her in the Mortal Realm?

381
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:45,410
Fourth Older Brother, you are right.

382
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:51,390
But subsequently, I like Ye Hua, too.

383
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:56,180
After getting along with each other, I have never asked him this question again.

384
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:04,720
Thinking about this now, when I first met him in the Eastern Sea, he acknowledged me as Mochi's biological mother.

385
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,810
Fourth Older Brother, tell me.

386
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:12,360
If Ye Hua likes me only because I resemble Mochi's mother,

387
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,410
what's the difference in me being a substitute then?

388
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:23,570
Ye Hua loved that mortal for three hundred years.

389
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:27,450
For three hundred years, he has always been deeply in love.

390
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:29,360
He has never changed.

391
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,470
Why did he have a change of affections when he met me?

392
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:36,790
Ye Hua and I had never encountered each other by fate.

393
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:40,720
If you were to talk about understanding, you should know him better than I do.

394
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:47,280
Whether his feelings for you are real, or something else, don't you feel anything at all?

395
00:33:53,150 --> 00:34:01,360
If I didn't see Ye Hua and that puppet who looks like Mochi's mother being close with each other tonight,

396
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:08,900
I could still lie to myself that he's sincere towards me.

397
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,770
I love Ye Hua for who he is.

398
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:15,880
But if Ye Hua loves me,

399
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:20,700
it's only because I look like Mochi's mother.

400
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:27,430
He's lovesick over this mortal person and found me as the last resort.

401
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:31,920
I'm unable to bear this kind of love.

402
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:38,400
You've lived for far too short.

403
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:42,330
What's the point in being too serious about certain matters?

404
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:46,160
Think about how Ye Hua usually treats you.

405
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:51,880
You think more. What's the point to be bothered over a dead person?

406
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:57,160
Yes, I shouldn't live in such a confused manner.

407
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,050
Young Fifth.

408
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,610
Girl, what are you doing?

409
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:09,720
Why is she up and down so quickly?

410
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,880
Weren't things going smoothly?

411
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,870
She's going to get married and her teacher is back.

412
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:16,870
She was smiling every day and couldn't close her mouth.

413
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:22,170
There's indeed a clash in the five elements between Heavenly Tribe and Green Hill.

414
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:25,440
What's wrong? What happened?

415
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:31,370
I don't know. I really can't understand the thoughts of romantic couples.

416
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:35,260
It's right that you don't understand. Let them torture themselves.

417
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:39,710
Drink your medicine first. I brewed it for three to four hours.

418
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,510
I need to take this again?

419
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:44,920
You are not taking revenge on me for beating you at chess in Kunlun Void, right?

420
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,680
You must have deliberately added some extremely bitter stuff in there, right?

421
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:53,680
Zhen Zhen, o' Zhen Zhen, starting with sensibility, taking medicine has always been like this.

422
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,030
You keep saying that I added some bitter stuff in there.

423
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:06,420
Here. I specially obtained the best peach blossom nectar from the disciples in Kunlun Void.

424
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,500
Do you think I'm a one-year-old kid?

425
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,120
Taking medicine with peach blossom nectar?

426
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:25,720
It tastes good.

427
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:45,420
My Lady, how is it?

428
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:51,470
High Goddess Bai Qian saw that puppet with Ye Hua.

429
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:56,540
Although she seemed indifferent, she can't hide from my eyes.

430
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:03,590
I have finally found her weak spot.

431
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:07,960
It's only a matter of time before she leaves Mighty Monarch.

432
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:11,260
Congratulations, My Lady.

433
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:14,990
Get a hot cup of tea for me.

434
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:16,670
Yes!

435
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:45,490
Great Lady, would you like to eat your meal?

436
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:16,760
If I say that I won't hate you for a day, I fear it's today.

437
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:19,960
Mighty Monarch loves you very much.

438
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:24,270
I believe you don't want to see him marry and bring another person to Pure Wutong Palace, right?

439
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:26,510
It's Su Su.

440
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:34,630
My Lady, if Mighty Monarch returns and sees that you created a puppet to trick him, he will blame you.

441
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:37,140
Is this a good idea?

442
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:46,490
70,000 years ago, my tribe was destroyed for the sake of the Heavenly Tribe.

443
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:48,510
Take 10,000 steps back.

444
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:53,860
Mighty Monarch still needs to retain me to stabilize the leaders of each branch.

445
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:59,900
With Heavenly Monarch and so many leaders of the branches here,

446
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,200
don't worry.

447
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,090
Nothing will happen to me.

448
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,670
Yes.

449
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:16,760
Since Great Lady came back from Peach Blossom Forest, she has slept for two days.

450
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,000
That's right.

451
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,080
- Great Lady.
- Aunt.

452
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,760
Bring some wine here.

453
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,770
Aunt.

454
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:06,310
Fengjiu is here.

455
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:17,530
Do you know I asked Ye Hua a few days ago if he knows me,

456
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:20,080
he said that he doesn't?

457
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:29,150
Subsequently, he brought another woman home after a few days.

458
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,610
Aunt, His Highness the Crown Prince drank the Water of Forgetfulness.

459
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:38,430
It's a given that he doesn't remember you.

460
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,550
He doesn't remember me?

461
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:51,600
Do you know that the woman he took in looks exactly like Mochi's mother?

462
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,790
Su Su?

463
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:58,540
You know Su Su, too?

464
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:02,430
When I was in Heavenly Palace...

465
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:05,180
Don't say anymore. I don't want to listen.

466
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:16,370
Aunt, when His Highness the Crown Prince used the Soul-Gathering Lamp to build Su Su's flesh and blood,

467
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:19,860
I thought that you had a big heart and wouldn't fuss about this.

468
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,540
Wouldn't fuss about this?

469
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:30,150
That's because I'm stupid.

470
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:33,550
I thought that what happened in the past,

471
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:36,080
I didn't need to care too much about it.

472
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:45,370
I only know today when I saw that he didn't recognize me but that woman,

473
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:49,110
I then realized,

474
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:57,130
what he couldn't let go was someone else, not me.

”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

476
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:28,600
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

477
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:31,210
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

478
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:36,470
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

479
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:45,950
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

480
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:49,820
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

481
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:55,250
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

482
00:43:55,250 --> 00:44:02,550
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

483
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:07,320
♫ All are just illusions ♫

484
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:14,210
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

485
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:19,390
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

486
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:23,860
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

487
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:30,050
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

488
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:35,480
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

489
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:40,750
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

490
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:43,540
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

491
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:52,410
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from
my previous life ♫

492
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:04,620
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

493
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:10,180
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

494
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:14,490
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

495
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:20,760
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

496
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:26,010
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

497
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:31,570
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

498
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:34,280
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

499
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:43,220
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

500
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:55,700
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
