♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,120
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,630
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,820
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,460
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:35,160
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,760
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,230
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:46,050
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,360
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,090
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:56,430
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,240
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,630
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:07,130
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:10,530
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,150
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,010
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,860
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,310
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:24,800
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,860
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:31,910
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:34,320
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,930
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:42,070
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

What are you doing?

32
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,010
His Highness the Crown Prince said there will be a wedding in Pure Wutong Palace in a few days.

33
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:29,420
No one outside of this palace is allowed to come in or out.

34
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,210
How dare you! You dare stop Her Highness?

35
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:34,780
Heavenly Monarch arranged for Consort Su Jin's marriage to the crown prince already.

36
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,020
She's entering Pure Wutong Palace in half a month, too.

37
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,950
Are you two not afraid?

38
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,520
We just came back from the battlefield.

39
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,020
We've spent so much time in the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses.

40
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,550
We're unsure of the rules in Nine Heavens indeed.

41
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,760
We apologize if we insulted Miss.

42
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,540
Oh, I don't mean Miss. I mean Consort. Consort Su Jin.

43
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,460
Don't worry. No wonder I saw you two looked unfamiliar.

44
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,510
Once I enter Pure Wutong Palace later,

45
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,770
I'll naturally get familiar with you two.

46
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,570
Thank you for coming, Your Highness.

47
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,360
Be careful.

48
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,030
Thank you.

49
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:52,620
Strange. That woman smells naturally of peach blossoms.

50
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,100
That's the smell from my Peach Blossoms forest.

51
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,590
She must be connected to Young Fifth somehow.

52
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,610
I need to go back to Heavenly Palace.

Ah Li, I am leaving.

55
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,140
My Lady, Nai Nai brought His Young Highness to meet Consort Le Xu.

56
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,940
I got it.

00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,160
Where are you going, My Lady?

58
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,870
It's stuffy in here.

59
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,510
I want to take a walk.

60
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,970
Do you want us to accompany you?

61
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,510
No need.

62
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,360
I'm familiar with this route.

63
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,460
I can go by myself.

64
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:13,210
My Lady, are you sure you don't want company?

65
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,640
She's never even hugged His Young Highness once.

66
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,520
She doesn't like getting close to people.

67
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,960
She's quite pitiful.

68
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,760
I wonder what disease took her eyes.

00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:04,810
It must be connected to the person who sealed him.

158
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:09,990
Emperor, by saving Her Young Highness, you lost half of your power.

159
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:12,940
- I'm worried about you.
- It's right for you to worry.

160
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,050
I'm going into seclusion to recuperate.

161
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:20,420
While I'm doing that, help me to write something on the Book of Fate.

162
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:24,060
Book of Fate. I can only control the fate of mortals.

163
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:27,290
I'm unable to do anything about the fate of immortals.

164
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:31,780
After I leave my seclusion, I'm going to the Mortal Realm.

165
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:35,680
What are you going to do there?

166
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,930
My fate is not affected by the Red Comet.

167
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:47,420
Once I go to the Mortal Realm, you can write some predestined marriages in your Book of Fate.

168
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:52,720
She was with me in the Heavenly Palace for a long time.

169
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,130
I must fulfill her wish of staying with me for a lifetime.

170
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:03,450
If Heavenly Monarch were to ask, what should I say?

171
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,300
Just say that...

172
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:10,180
I want to experience the six sufferings of life.
(Life, old age, illness, death, love, and unfulfilled wishes)

173
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,770
Father Monarch, this is not desirable.

174
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:02,300
Members of the Heavenly Tribe require the Mythical Mushroom to purify their cultivation.

175
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:07,200
Or else, you and Ye Hua will be possessed and enter into the path of the demons.

176
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,920
In this kind of situation, we don't have time.

177
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,420
Even so, you mustn't!

178
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,970
One of you is the Heavenly Monarch and one of you is the crown prince.

179
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:18,110
If both of you go down the demonic path, what will the Heavenly Tribe do?!

180
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:21,650
Wait for me and Eldest Brother to get the Mythical Mushroom back from Eastern Sea. Father, have patience.

181
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:24,880
We can't. There's no time.

182
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,690
- Father, please forgive me.
- Third Younger Brother, what are you doing?

183
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:39,310
What do you think I'm doing?!

184
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:41,660
You know how much Father loves Ye Hua.

185
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,180
He's even willing to give up his life for him.

186
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,250
Why then would he be afraid of being demonized?

187
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,760
Don't waste time, Eldest Brother. Come with me to get the Mystical Mushroom.

188
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,850
Eldest Sister-in-Law, I will leave this to you.

189
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:55,130
Before we return, other than the Medicine King, no one can come in.

190
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,930
All right.

191
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,620
Let's go!

192
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:02,730
Okay.

193
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:12,430
Ye Hua, why are you like this to me?

194
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:16,020
What I ask is not to have you for myself only.

195
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:21,590
I merely want to be able to stay by your side. Will it not work?

196
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:26,490
Your Highness! Your Highness!

197
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:29,170
Quickly go to the Purple Morning Hall!

198
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:31,560
- What's wrong?
- His Highness the Crown Prince...

199
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,110
His Highness the Crown Prince jumped from the Immortal Execution Platform.

200
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:36,620
It's still unknown if he can survive.

201
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:39,050
What?! What did you say?!

202
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:41,370
Hurry. Please hurry up and go, Your Highness.

203
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:46,620
Maybe... you might be able to see him one last time.

204
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,230
Your Highness!

205
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,970
- High God.
- High God.

206
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:14,710
- What has happened?
- High God, His Mighty Monarch is heavily injured.

207
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,860
Heavenly Monarch is currently in the Purple Morning Hall waiting for the Mythical Mushroom,

208
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,010
so he could transfer his cultivation to the crown prince and save his life.

209
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:21,150
Heavily injured?

210
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:23,600
Wasn't he fine just earlier?

211
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,790
High God.

212
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:32,090
- Hurry. Medicine King, come with me.
- Wait.

213
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:37,450
High God, do you need anything else?

214
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,100
Why not take me with you?

215
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,380
My medicine skills might be of help.

216
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,770
That's right.

217
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:49,430
In the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses, you have the most advanced medical skills.

218
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:53,880
Jia Yun, take the two of us to see him.

219
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,450
All right, please come.

220
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:12,850
Your Highness can't go in.

221
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,850
Why can't I?

222
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:18,250
Eldest Highness and Third Highness gave instructions that until they come back,

223
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:21,360
other than the Medicine King, no one else can enter.

224
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:27,060
But why can High God Zhe Yan... High God Zhe Yan enter?

225
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,410
High God Zhe Yan's medical skills are known throughout the Four Seas.

226
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:35,520
I also risked getting beheaded and disobeyed orders, to let High God in to save His Highness the Crown Prince.

227
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,540
Your Highness won't be any help to His Highness the Crown Prince's injuries.

228
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:42,540
Please don't burden me.

229
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,910
Then tell me.

230
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,520
Is Ye Hua...?

231
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,240
He's still alive.

232
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,540
Consort Le Xu.

233
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,690
High God Zhe Yan.

234
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:48,710
Your Highness, my medicinal skills are way inferior to High God Zhe Yan.

235
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:52,280
High God just happened to be outside earlier.

236
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,760
Let him take a look first.

237
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,800
Sure. Sure.

238
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:01,890
High God Zhe Yan, if you can treat Ye Hua, naturally, I won't stop you.

239
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,400
Heavenly Monarch...

240
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,930
No need to explain. I didn't see anything.

241
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,530
I've long retired from the three realms.

242
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:19,860
I won't be particular with the formalities then.

243
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:28,690
Please leave.

244
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,030
Sure.

245
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:54,530
Your Highness, when High God Zhe Yan retired from the three realms,

246
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:57,270
although he sealed his magical weapon under Kunlun Void,

247
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,440
he still has his medicinal skills.

248
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,490
No one in the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses can compare to him.

249
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:06,450
We should wait patiently.

250
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,770
I don't know your relationship with Mo Yuan.

251
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:53,620
Even your spirits are similar.

252
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:58,490
If you are him, you better live.

253
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:01,450
Kunlun Void has waited for you for 70,000 years.

254
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:07,740
But if you aren't him, since you have the same face as him, you should be like him.

255
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:12,410
Live for the sake of the world and the lives of the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses.

256
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:34,220
Ye Hua,

257
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,530
my good grandson.

258
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:50,640
High God Zhe Yan.

259
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:57,390
Did my two unfilial sons bring you here from the Peach Blossoms forest?

260
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:00,910
It doesn't matter how I came.

261
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:05,080
Heavenly Monarch, Ye Hua isn't in danger now.

262
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:10,350
But... whether or not he can wake up will depend on his fate.

263
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:12,120
What?!

264
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:21,720
Do you mean...

265
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,230
that he'll sleep on forever?

266
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:28,230
That's a possibility.

267
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:03,810
How was it? Did you get the Mystical Mushroom?

268
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:07,690
Those four mythical beasts contain half of the cultivation power of Father God.

269
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:11,420
The two of us couldn't do anything against them.

270
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:21,730
It's fine. It's fine.

271
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:24,810
High God Zhe Yan has been in there all night.

272
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:27,430
Ye Hua will surely be saved.

273
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:31,150
High God Zhe Yan is inside?

274
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:35,430
Yes. He's been in there all night.

275
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,150
- Father Monarch.
- Father Monarch.

276
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:54,070
High God Zhe Yan, thank you for your help.

277
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:56,110
It's just a coincidence.

278
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:58,690
I've told Heavenly Monarch.

279
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:01,500
His Highness the Crown Prince's life is saved,

280
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:05,360
but whether or not he can wake up will depend on his fate.

281
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:11,490
Do you mean... there's a chance he won't wake up?

282
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,770
It depends on his will to live.

283
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:18,840
If he has anyone he treasures, bring them and keep them near him at all times.

284
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,770
It will help wake him up.

285
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:28,160
The only person he cares about is that mortal.

286
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:34,880
The soul of that mortal has completely been destroyed at the Immortal Execution Platform.

287
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,740
Mortal?

288
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,580
Was it that blind girl?

289
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,290
Everyone, I've done all that I can.

290
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:50,540
- I'll be leaving.
- High God.

291
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:54,470
We owe you a debt for helping us.

292
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:59,230
I will repay this debt another day.

293
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:03,980
I've withdrawn from the world. I don't have any requests

294
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:06,500
so I don't need any repayments.

295
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:10,020
His Highness the Crown Prince and I have just crossed fates.

296
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:32,770
Young Fifth.

297
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:27,370
Thank goodness nothing bad happened to you.

298
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:29,720
It's just skin injuries.

299
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,730
Do you have alcohol?

300
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:44,250
Huh?

301
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,280
I do.

302
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:51,450
But you need to tell me what happened.

303
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:58,660
Ever since you sealed Qing Cang, your parents and brothers have been searching for you like crazy.

304
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:02,160
Even I lost many days of sleep.

305
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:07,280
Your eyes and your injuries, what exactly happened?

306
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:17,340
What? Did you do something bad and are afraid I'll tell your fourth older brother?

307
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:29,890
I may have sealed Qing Cang,

308
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:34,430
but I didn't get away unscathed.

309
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:40,750
He sealed my memories and powers,

310
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:43,830
and I was thrown into Junji Mountain of the Eastern Wilderness

311
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:51,690
and went through a tribulation.

312
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,960
Zhe Yan,

313
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:04,450
I remember you have a medicine

314
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:10,200
that can erase your memories of what you want to forget.

315
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,870
Right?

316
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:20,450
You've had a rough few years.

317
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:29,630
It's up to you if you want to remember or forget.

318
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,810
But I'm warning you.

319
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:35,950
My medicine can't be undone.

320
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:42,930
Once you use it, all of your past will have nothing to do with you at all.

321
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,600
Mother always said that I've had a fortunate life.

322
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:06,030
Mother always said that I've had a fortunate life.

323
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:09,030
I was immortal from birth.

324
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:11,870
I didn't need to cultivate to become a goddess.

325
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,200
But nothing comes cheap among these Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses.

326
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:24,410
If I don't experience a heavenly tribulation,

327
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:27,050
how can I become a high goddess?

328
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,820
These years that passed

329
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:44,850
were merely a heavenly tribulation for me.

330
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:53,530
Now that this tribulation has passed,

331
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:59,260
there's no need to remember these events.

332
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,940
Ye Hua,

333
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:15,220
please open your eyes. Okay?

334
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,690
This is your child.

335
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:19,900
He just lost his mother.

336
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:24,240
If he also loses his father, he'll be pitiful.

337
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,350
Please look at him. Okay?

338
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,510
What happened all of a sudden?

339
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,850
He received lightening for days.

340
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:52,780
Then, for the crown prince coronation, he received thirty-six uncultivated fires and nine heavenly strikes of lightning.

341
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:57,420
His jump was clearly suicide.

342
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:03,450
If only... I let him marry that mortal,

343
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:08,200
at most, Pure Wutong Palace would have an extra side consort.

344
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,190
He wouldn't go as far as to commit suicide.

345
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,520
Enough.

346
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,940
It's my fault.

347
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:24,150
Father Monarch, I was not filial.

348
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:26,990
I raised a disappointing son.

349
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:39,550
He's always been the Heavenly Tribe's most trusted crown prince.

350
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:43,950
Ye Hua, I forced you into this state.

351
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:50,590
I thought if I forced that mortal to die, you would be upset for a few days,

352
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:59,420
but you'd continue to be the most revered Heavenly Crown Prince.

353
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:10,100
But I never knew... you treasured this mortal woman... to this extent.

354
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:16,520
Is it true Ye Hua will never wake back up?

355
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:20,890
I'm useless.

356
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:25,200
There might be another way.

357
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,730
What way?

358
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:32,760
Heavenly Tribe has a relic called the Soul-Gathering Lamp.

359
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,510
Father God created it during the great flood.

360
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:38,580
That lamp can gather the spirit of an immortal.

361
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:43,050
The Soul-Gathering Lamp is a relic of the Heavenly Tribe?

362
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:45,230
Why haven't I heard of this?

363
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:49,080
This relic is from the Sujin Tribe.

364
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,000
Sujin Tribe?

365
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,190
I remember it.

366
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:01,780
I remember that lamp.

367
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:06,690
My mother said this lamp can gather an immortal's spirit.

368
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:08,200
Are you sure?

369
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,120
Where is it now?

370
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:14,470
My mother used to protect it when I was young.

371
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:18,330
Later, my tribe was wiped out and buried in the Sea of Innocence

372
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:23,280
The things I buried with my mother are in the Sea of Innocence!

373
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,540
Sea of Innocence?

374
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,910
The place where we bury immortals' bodies.

375
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:40,290
Since it's buried with the dead,

376
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:43,430
it must be buried in your mother's crystal coffin.

377
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:48,060
But it's been 70,000 years.

378
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:52,720
If I open the coffin now,

379
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,730
I fear...

380
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:56,680
You do not need to hesitate.

381
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,910
Since that lamp can save the Heavenly Tribe's crown prince,

382
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:03,950
I'm sure those buried there wouldn't mind being disturbed.

383
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:10,010
I'll send Tian Shu to accompany you there to get the lamp.

384
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:14,290
Having her daughter open her coffin is better than a stranger.

385
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:18,890
Yes. I will go now.

386
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:36,550
Mother, thank you for giving me another chance.

387
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:40,120
I won't waste it this time for sure.

388
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,270
I won't for sure.

389
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:57,240
Your Highness, you've obtained the lamp?

390
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,090
This is the Soul-Gathering Lamp.

391
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:02,400
- Come back to the Heavenly Palace with me now.
- Yes.

392
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:32,630
I have retrieved the Soul-Gathering Lamp from my mother's coffin.

393
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:39,190
Heavenly Monarch, for everything that I've done for you,

394
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:42,330
will you remember what you once promised me?

395
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:46,160
Su Jin, you were once my side consort

396
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,410
and you're the descendant of martyrs.

397
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:52,790
If you want, I can give you a better marriage arrangement.

398
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:55,260
Why must you marry Ye Hua?

399
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,890
I beg you, Heavenly Monarch, to grant me this wish.

400
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:20,760
Fine. I promise you.

401
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,430
You were the one who brought this lamp today.

402
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:30,220
If Ye Hua really can wake up, I'll make sure you marry into Pure Wutong Palace.

403
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:32,820
Thank you, Heavenly Monarch.

404
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:27,970
”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

405
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:30,050
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

406
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:32,700
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

407
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:38,060
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

408
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:47,210
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

409
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:51,370
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

410
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:56,670
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

411
00:43:56,670 --> 00:44:02,680
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

412
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:08,820
♫ All are just illusions ♫

413
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:15,570
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

414
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:20,900
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

415
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:25,330
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

416
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:31,450
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

417
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:36,870
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

418
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:42,180
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

419
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:45,060
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

420
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:54,310
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from my previous life ♫

421
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:06,060
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

422
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:11,650
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

423
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:15,980
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

424
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:22,350
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

425
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:27,550
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

426
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:32,890
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

427
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:35,800
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

428
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:44,890
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

429
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:57,160
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
