”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

2
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:17,590
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:21,150
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,760
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,990
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,430
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:35,250
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,860
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:42,260
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,990
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,470
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:53,140
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:56,520
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,150
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:03,580
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:07,160
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,620
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,080
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,060
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,890
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:21,360
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,760
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,190
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:31,930
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:34,660
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:38,760
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,150
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,040
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

29
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:05,350
[Eternal Love]

30
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,920
[Episode 18]

31
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:18,160
There are many wounded soldiers inside; not suitable for women to go in.

32
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,090
You wait for me outside.

33
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,740
Let's go.

34
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,630
Your Second Highness.

35
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:38,140
- Your Second Highness.
- Your Second Highness.

36
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:45,180
Although these soldiers belong to Long Sea, they seem to obey you more.

37
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,890
Since I got back from Kunlun Void, I've been helping my uncle to lead the soldiers at Long Sea.

38
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,060
So naturally, they obey me more.

39
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,410
My uncle has no son.

40
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:57,610
That's also the reason that he's unwilling to break with the Merpeople Tribe so easily.

41
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:01,010
After all, the Heavenly Tribe is so far away.

42
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:04,750
When the Heavenly soldiers are gone, it leaves the Merpeople Tribe of Long Sea to him.

43
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,810
And eventually, Long Sea Water Monarch will have to endure the vengeance.

44
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:13,190
If we want to go into war, no one should be spared to prevent future trouble.

45
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,360
I want to keep my leg.

46
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,840
Do you want to keep your leg or your life?

47
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,570
For someone like me, losing a leg is like losing my life.

48
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,500
What will I use to make a living?

49
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:34,480
I'm telling you, your leg injury is too serious.

50
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,560
- Army physician.
- Your Second Highness.

51
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,710
What is the condition of these injured soldiers?

52
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:43,150
It... is not too good.

53
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,450
Do you want to go home?

54
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,960
I want to go home even in my dreams.

55
00:03:54,970 --> 00:04:00,630
If you are given a chance to end this war that has been going on for thousands of years, will you take it?

56
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:04,240
I will. I will.

57
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:17,220
Everyone, I have a favor to ask today.

58
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,490
Can I get some help from you all?

59
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:22,850
Your Second Highness, we are all wounded soldiers here.

60
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:25,110
We can only follow you and give up our lives for you.

61
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:28,360
How can we make changes?

62
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,350
- That's right! 
- There are altogether only 40 some people in this tent.

63
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:34,790
- How can we help you?
- I know what you are all worried about.

64
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:38,050
After all, Long Sea Water Monarch doesn't want to declare war with the Merpeople Tribe.

65
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,880
You all worry that instead of making things work, you'd be committing a crime.

66
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,510
Your Second Highness, we're not afraid to die.

67
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:48,340
- But we're afraid that our families may suffer during the war.
 - That's right!

68
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,600
People from the Merpeople Tribe are violent and vengeful.

69
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,080
During the endless minor wars that we had, only us soldiers are injured.

70
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,460
But if a big war comes, it's all right if we win.

71
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,430
If we lose, Water Monarch would just end it with a letter of surrender.

72
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:03,900
- But we would be the ones to endure suffering.
- That's right.

73
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,260
We fought with the Merpeople Tribe before.

74
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,520
We lost most of the time.

75
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,000
- That's right.
- It's true, Your Second Highness.

76
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,450
We have our difficulties.

77
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,400
How could I not care about your wellbeings at Long Sea?

78
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:21,030
This is Crown Prince of Heavenly Tribe.

79
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:27,570
The reason His Highness came is to show the determination of Heavenly Tribe to wage war against Merpeople Tribe.

80
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:31,480
Heavenly Palace has finally taken notice of Long Sea.

81
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,840
We beg Heavenly Palace to send troops to drive the Merpeople out of Long Sea, Your Highness.

82
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,230
All thirteen members of my family were killed by the Merpeople Tribe.

83
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:44,310
They are my enemies and I will never forget this hatred.

84
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:49,900
We beg Heavenly Palace to send troops to drive the Merpeople out of Long Sea.

85
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:58,410
I swear to you today that I will drive the Merpeople out of Long Sea and return forever peace to you all.

86
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:01,830
Thank you, Your Highness.

87
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,990
Are you all right?

88
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:21,230
I just ran into some wounded soldiers, saw blood, and suddenly I'm not feeling well.

89
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,450
Maybe it's because I drank yesterday.

90
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:30,710
Young Sir, you are gentle and quiet in nature, so you're not used to places like the military camp.

91
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,880
Here, drink some water.

92
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,950
No, thank you.

93
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:41,260
That's okay. Water from here may not be clean anyway.

94
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,680
How about you go back and take a rest?

95
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,030
Is there a clean tent?

96
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,130
Let an army physician come take a look at him.

97
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,770
Let me go now to find a clean tent.

98
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,190
How is he?

99
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,410
Just tell the truth.

100
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,180
Sir.

101
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:15,030
This young sir's pulse condition indicates pregnancy.

102
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,540
What?

103
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:25,770
I understand. You two can leave now, but don't speak to anyone about this.

104
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:28,080
Sir, please rest assured.

105
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:40,540
Ye Hua, is he telling the truth?

106
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,550
I—

107
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,620
Su Su, you can't stay here anymore.

108
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,860
I must send you back right away.

109
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,450
Why do you want to send me away?

110
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,580
There'll be a big war here at Long Sea.

111
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,280
Now that you are pregnant, I can't let you stay here.

112
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,910
You are just a mortal, too.

113
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,690
Why do you want to stay here?

114
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,700
One last time.

115
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,130
- Really?
- Really and truly.

116
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:25,960
Okay then. I will trust you one more time.

117
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,500
Where do you want to go?

118
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:36,480
Now that I'm pregnant, you're not going to let me move around?

119
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:47,230
Is this what it's like to be pregnant?

120
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:55,160
How come you don't look happy?

121
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,530
You've been keeping a straight face since you'd heard that I was pregnant.

122
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:01,720
Have I?

123
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:06,510
Yes, up till now I haven't seen you smile.

124
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,480
I'm just so happy that I forgot how to smile.

125
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,290
Congratulations, Sir.

126
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,580
You are going to be a father.

127
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,970
Congratulations to you, too. You are going to be a mother.

128
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:31,090
Does it taste good?

129
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,790
I cooked all these dishes.

130
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:37,960
If you are not used to these, I will find other ingredients to cook again.

131
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:44,350
When you were cultivating to be an immortal, were you a cook?

132
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:48,260
Was it because you knew how to wield a sword and fight, you were sent to subdue the demons?

133
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,030
I have never cooked for anyone.

134
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,560
Really?

135
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,140
These taste really great.

136
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:04,480
Ye Hua, what were you like when you were a child?

137
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,470
When I was a child?

138
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,220
Did you like to cry or create a fuss?

139
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:17,370
I was thinking, whether the child in my stomach would be like you.

140
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:24,530
When your mother gave birth to you, was it a smooth delivery?

141
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,750
My mother had a hard time when she was giving birth to me.

142
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,600
She was in pain for seven days.

143
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,460
Was it really that tormenting?

144
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,820
My father said that, too.

145
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:39,210
Your mother must dote on you very much.

146
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,660
I can't say that I was favored.

147
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,390
When I was born, I was carried away.

148
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:49,310
I only met my mother when I was a youngster.

149
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,590
I had a renowned teacher.

150
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:56,320
Therefore, I would go to study at around 7:00 a.m. every day.

151
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,780
Whenever I sat to study, it would be fourteen hours till the lights are lit up in every house around 9:00 p.m.

152
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:10,940
Because you were studying under a renowned teacher, you suffered this torture.

153
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:16,380
Wouldn't that Crown Prince in Heaven suffer even more torture?

154
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,120
Perhaps.

155
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,410
Why don't we leave?

156
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,940
Yan Zhi.

157
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,880
Uncle.

158
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:10,230
If you hadn't come, I would have forgotten about you, my nephew.

159
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,400
Uncle,

160
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,310
I'm here to borrow a few thousands of soldiers and horses from you.

161
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:23,300
Borrow my soldiers?

162
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,110
Forget about your unrealistic dream.

163
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,240
In the past, my grandfather treated you like his own son.

164
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:37,900
I didn't imagine that you would be so ungrateful now!

165
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,320
Your grandfather?

166
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:45,410
Your mother died 100,000 years ago.

167
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:51,390
Your father has been sealed in the Donghuang Bell for 70,000 years.

168
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:57,570
Even the entire Winged Tribe is in the hands of your younger, lazy brother.

169
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,210
What else do you have?

170
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:02,670
You dare to say such deceit in front of me?

171
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:05,140
If not because my grandfather didn't have a son,

172
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,280
and only had my mother and aunts,

173
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,560
would you even be a leader now?!

174
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,670
Leave! Don't get in my way.

175
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:15,950
If you keep nagging, I might refuse to speak to you.

176
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,630
- You!
- What "you?!" Scram!

177
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:20,600
I told you to scram. Didn't you hear me?

178
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,980
Let me tell you. Even the Water Monarch is giving us face now.

179
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:27,460
Even if the Winged Monarch were here, he must pay respect to our Grand Chieftain.

180
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:31,770
You are without any authority and power. You are only just a First Prince in name. Where are you from?

181
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,870
You dare to disturb the drinking zest of our Grand Chieftain?

182
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,690
That's right. Get lost now!

183
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,420
Our chieftain doesn't have the time to listen to your nonsense.

184
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:53,450
- Get lost!
- Get lost!

185
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:57,350
If your grandfather didn't give me this chieftain position, I would have chopped you a long time ago.

186
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,890
You ungrateful creature.

187
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,710
Chieftain.

188
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,600
You should drink less.

189
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,430
In a short while, you need to go to Long Sea Crystal Palace for a banquet.

190
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,090
Banquet?

191
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:16,030
Isn't it because that old Water Monarch wants to give me his daughter to avoid disaster?

192
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:19,710
He insisted on inviting that whatever Mo Yuan's eldest disciple to fight with me for thousands of years.

193
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,300
Now, he's trying to win me over with a beauty.

194
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:26,130
It's useless whatever he does. Long Sea will be mine sooner or later.

195
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,890
Greetings, Father.

196
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:36,720
Hong'er, rise.

197
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:45,750
Hong'er, go on my behalf and bring back a princess that is nice looking as my wife.

198
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:49,220
- All right.
- Go with the Prince.

199
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:54,720
Don't treat them too well or lest they take advantage of your weakness.

200
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:00,260
Don't let them think that just because they are giving me a princess, everything will be fine.

201
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,790
Yes.

202
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,810
How long did I sleep?

203
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:24,830
I slept till I'm disorientated.

204
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,570
There's a banquet tonight.

205
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,170
You are pregnant, so you shouldn't go.

206
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:34,190
Good. I didn't want to deal with those princesses, anyway.

207
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:38,640
I'm leaving now.

208
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,720
Your Highness, the situation has changed.

209
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,660
The chieftain of the Merpeople Tribe didn't come. It's his youngest son instead.

210
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,180
This is even better.

211
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,790
Come, let's drink. Let's drink. Okay?

212
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:10,300
Young Prince, you have the bearing of the chieftain from tens of thousands of years ago.

213
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:14,870
I'm so envious since I only have two daughters.

214
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:17,070
Water Monarch, no need to be so polite.

215
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:21,130
Come, let's all give a toast to the Young Prince.

216
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:23,500
- Cheers, Young Prince.
- Cheers, Young Prince.

217
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:33,410
Lu Xiu, hurry up and pour wine for the Young Prince.

218
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,620
Young Prince.

219
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,720
This is...?

220
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,260
This is my second daughter, Lu Xiu.

221
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:02,790
I see, it's Princess Lu Xiu.

222
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,110
Please.

223
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,490
- Shameless.
- What did you say?

224
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:10,960
Why did you touch my hand?

225
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,430
It's your blessing that I like you.

226
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:19,480
Would you rather marry my father and be among his countless women than to commit yourself to me?

227
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,000
- You!
- Lu Xiu.

228
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:30,220
Father, their whole tribe has no sense of honor. They're cruel and virtueless.

229
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,150
Why do you yield to them on everything?

230
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,650
You should let go and fight with them.

231
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:38,830
How presumptuous. Shut your mouth.

232
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,000
Greetings, Water Monarch.

233
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,660
If there are any problems, talk after the banquet.

234
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:53,480
Water Monarch, it's urgent military matters.

235
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,830
Urgent military matters?

236
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:04,580
What? Is this true?

237
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,950
It's absolutely so.

238
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:10,120
What happened?

239
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,690
It's nothing. A minor matter. A minor matter.

240
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,240
A minor matter?

241
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,400
But why does it sound like a military matter to me?

242
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,580
In this Long Sea, other than your troops, it's the troops of my Merpeople Tribe.

243
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:26,910
What other military matters would escape my eyes?

244
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,360
It's just some internal military matters.

245
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,310
It doesn't involve outsiders.

246
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:37,530
Uncle, I'm afraid it is related to the Merpeople Tribe.

247
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:41,130
Die Feng?

248
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,490
Uncle, mutiny is not a small matter.

249
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:49,980
If you can't give the soldiers any explanation,

250
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,170
I fear that before we take actions on the Merpeople Tribe,

251
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:55,590
Long Sea's many years of foundation will be destroyed!

252
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,930
If you still regard me as your uncle, then shut your mouth!

253
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:02,250
What's wrong? What do you mean by mutiny?

254
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:07,360
Young Prince, don't misunderstand.

255
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:12,050
I heard that Long Sea's Water Monarch is slow to take actions and is indecisive.

256
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:15,490
After meeting you today, it's indeed just like what the rumors say.

257
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:18,060
You have disappointed me.

258
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,480
You are an insignificant immortal.

259
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,740
How dare you act so unrestrained in front of me?

260
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,300
Nephew, your friend is...?

261
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:43,580
This is His Highness, the Crown Prince.

262
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,400
His Highness, the Crown Prince?

263
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,330
Greetings, Your Highness the Crown Prince.

264
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:58,760
Greetings, Your Highness the Crown Prince.

265
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,650
Please rise.

266
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,410
Yes.

267
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:09,510
I didn't know Your Highness came incognito to Long Sea.

268
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:13,470
If I was impolite, please forgive me.

269
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:18,770
Being impolite is not a sin, but losing propriety of the divine tribes is a major sin.

270
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,860
Your Highness, don't listen to slanderous talks of others.

271
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,920
I have been in Long Sea for 17,000 years.

272
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:28,020
Although I don't have any major merits, I have always adhered to my duties.

273
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:31,520
I wouldn't dare to lose the propriety of the divine tribes.

274
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,170
Is that so?

275
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:38,440
Merpeople Tribe repeatedly hurt the people and brought disaster to Long Sea.

276
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,590
Why didn't you report to Heavenly Palace?

277
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:45,770
As the Water Monarch of the Long Sea, you even bowed and scraped to the mere son of the Merpeople Chieftain,

278
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:48,270
and also tried to cover up the mutiny!

279
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,570
What's the use of having you?

280
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:54,820
I... I had no other options.

281
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:58,910
As the Water Monarch of Long Sea, firstly, you couldn't let your people live in peace.

282
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:01,220
Secondly, you couldn't allow your soldiers to surrender.

283
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,280
Thirdly, you couldn't even protect your own family.

284
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,260
How do you expect me to trust you?!

285
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,630
Stand up!

286
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:18,300
Your Highness the Crown Prince, spare my life. Spare my life.

287
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:22,500
Uncle, get up first.

288
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:32,910
His Highness especially came here to Long Sea this time to exterminate the Merpeople Tribe.

289
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:36,490
If you want to live, you must do something.

290
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:44,410
Have a sacrifice ceremony.

291
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:46,480
The Merpeople Tribe are the most bloodthirsty.

292
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,240
Their chieftain dotes on his youngest son the most.

293
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,840
What if we really kill him?

294
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,960
What if we really kill him and don't win this war?

295
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,900
I fear that the whole Long Sea will be destroyed.

296
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,550
If you hesitate further, it's a death penalty.

297
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:18,770
Men, detain these two people of the Merpeople Tribe.

298
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:23,350
- Behead them for the sacrifice ceremony!
- Yes!

299
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:37,380
Long Sea Water Monarch, my father will definitely massacre your entire tribe at Long Sea.

300
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:40,160
Let's go.

301
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:45,390
- My father will definitely massacre your entire Long Sea tribe!
- Let's go.

302
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:48,870
Your Highness, we only have 10,000 soldiers.

303
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:52,530
We are not worthy of the 70,000 brave and skillful soldiers of the Merpeople Tribe.

304
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:56,710
Your Highness, please help us.

305
00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:02,540
Although Long Sea is a colony, Heavenly Tribe has always treated you equally.

306
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,960
Since you have decided,

307
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,400
I will appoint someone to assist you and guarantee that Long Sea will have many years of peace.

308
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,830
Thank you, Your Highness the Crown Prince.

309
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:15,300
Thank you, Your Highness the Crown Prince.

310
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:56,640
Ye Hua, my grudge with you is absolutely irreconcilable!

311
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:02,160
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

312
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,650
This hairstyle highlights your powerful immortal appearance.

313
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:16,270
There's nothing else to remedy it.

314
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,900
Su Su, close your eyes.

315
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,410
Are we going to the Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms again?

316
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,320
Isn't this our Junji Mountain?

317
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,680
Come here.

318
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,140
We are finally back.

319
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,030
We are back.

320
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:04,260
We will never leave again.

321
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:15,000
I have some important task left to do.

322
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,690
Will you be here in time before our child is born?

323
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:23,500
I definitely will.

324
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:27,350
I will leave and come back soon, and never leave the both of you again.

325
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,080
Do you still remember the copper mirror?

326
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:34,640
If there's anything urgent, use the copper mirror to summon me.

327
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:37,650
I will be back within two weeks.

328
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:42,280
If more than two weeks pass, and you are still not back...

329
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,440
What will happen if I don't?

330
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:50,690
If you are still not back, I will give you another two weeks.

331
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:54,060
If you still delay, I will not let you off that easily.

332
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,770
Fine.

333
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,310
But Su Su, you must remember that

334
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:02,500
when I'm gone, you must not leave this forest.

335
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,290
You are pregnant with my child.

336
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:07,610
It will be very easy for my family to find out.

337
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:10,660
If they find out, it won't be good.

338
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,940
What's not good about it?

339
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:16,900
I will tell you the details when I'm back.

340
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:22,330
I'm already pregnant with your child and still can't meet your family?

341
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,720
Once I come back,

342
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:34,340
we will find a suitable place to plant your own plot of Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms.

343
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:21,280
All right.

344
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:27,760
I will permit you to send out the troops tomorrow morning.

345
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,790
Exterminate the Merpeople Tribe of Long Sea within a month.

346
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,590
Make it seven days.

347
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,330
Seven days?

348
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:42,920
I will surely bring back the head of the Merpeople Chieftain within seven days.

349
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:47,140
Make use of suppressing the Merpeople Tribe to bring up the power of Four Seas again.

350
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:51,530
Ye Hua, don't disappoint me.

351
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:54,370
I will not disgrace you.

352
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:57,450
There's another matter.

353
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:59,790
There's a reply from Green Hill regarding the date of your marriage.

354
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,640
Bai Qian is currently in seclusion.

355
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,600
Once she comes out, it will be your wedding day.

356
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,290
Yes.

357
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:12,180
Congratulations, Your Highness the Crown Prince.

358
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:25,530
I'm going to ask you one last time.

359
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:31,590
Just because of this woman, are you really going to give up your post as the future Heavenly Monarch?

360
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:34,240
What is this called in the mortal world?

361
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,450
"Choosing to love a woman over one's empire is not the act of a wise emperor."

362
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:44,510
If I reluctantly get on the throne, I won't be a wise ruler, either.

363
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:49,620
It's better to leave the seat vacant as soon as possible for a more virtuous person.

364
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:52,510
Once I die, who knows?

365
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:55,850
Heavenly Monarch may choose an even better successor.

366
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:06,450
This battle is also my way of repaying the debt I have to Heavenly Monarch for raising and teaching me for all these years.

367
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:21,350
Third Uncle, will you help me?

368
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,410
This is karma.

369
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:29,820
When I bounded you to the marriage to Bai Qian of Green Hill,

370
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:32,250
I must have done it wrong.

371
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:36,060
Look now. The retribution came back so quickly.

372
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,800
But don't worry,

373
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,380
I will definitely help you.

374
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,130
I will definitely testify in front of my father.

375
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:46,830
I will testify that you have dissipated into dust, and I can't find any trace of you.

376
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,810
Thank you, Third Uncle, for fulfilling my wish.

377
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:59,790
But I still want to remind you:

378
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:02,170
My father has always been extremely skeptical.

379
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:04,180
You must be extra cautious.

380
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,280
This can't be rushed.

381
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,840
What if you attract his suspicions?

382
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,710
Even if you hide outside the three realms and five elements,

383
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:14,680
he will still personally bring you back for punishment.

384
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:20,670
I know Heavenly Monarch's temper and nature better than you do.

385
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:57,630
Your Third Highness, Your Highness the Crown Prince.

386
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,970
What are you doing?

387
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:06,600
Heavenly Monarch made orders that the whole Pure Wutong Palace must be cleaned and renovated.

388
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,030
It's a preparation for your upcoming wedding.

389
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:11,280
I see.

390
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,380
That's right, too. It's the Crown Prince marrying his crown princess consort.

391
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,550
It can't be done so hastily.

392
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:19,560
Indeed. Not a single drop of sloppiness is allowed.

393
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,700
Hence, I can't dare let the subordinates be in-charge of it.

394
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,030
I came here especially to check.

395
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:29,250
Where are Your Highnesses going?

396
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:31,160
Us?

397
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:35,060
We are going to greet Princess Consort Le Xu.

398
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:38,360
I just came back from Her Highness Le Xu's place.

399
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,680
Her Highness misses the Crown Prince very much.

400
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,950
If Your Highness visits her, she will be very happy for sure.

401
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:50,650
Talking about this, you are definitely the closest to Princess Consort Le Xu in Heavenly Palace.

402
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:53,690
Her Highness raised me. I owe her that.

403
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:56,950
It's a given that I should frequently visit her.

404
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,400
Congratulations, Your Highness the Crown Prince.

405
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:17,430
Congratulations, Your Highness the Crown Prince.

406
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,800
Congratulations, Your Highness the Crown Prince.

407
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,920
It seems like this good news has spread to all corners of Heavenly Palace.

408
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,730
Mother.

409
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:49,830
Ye Hua, come here.

410
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:08,380
Every time you visit me, you display so much etiquette.

411
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:11,290
It dissolves our affections as mother-and-son.

412
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:15,740
I feel sad and bitter, but I don't blame you.

413
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:20,440
Since you were born, I was not allowed to see you.

414
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:28,070
Whether you are hungry, tired, or having a tough time,

415
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:31,820
I couldn't be by your side to take care of you.

416
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:38,480
When I think of this, I feel very guilty.

417
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:44,020
Even regarding the marriage to Bai Qian of Green Hill,

418
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:48,590
I was the last to know in the palace.

419
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:54,690
Neither did I have the right to ask if you were happy with this marriage.

420
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:58,800
Mother, don't blame yourself.

421
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,240
As the Crown Prince of Heavenly Tribe, it's hard to act for myself.

422
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,770
My satisfaction is not important.

423
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,230
For the title of crown prince,

424
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:15,430
you have invested too much time and energy since you were a child.

425
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:21,480
I really hoped that you could be an ordinary and mediocre child

426
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,540
who does not need to be shackled.

427
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:30,260
Sister-in-Law, you're a bit too sentimental about the past today.

428
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,460
I don't know why either.

429
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:39,290
Ever since I heard that Ye Hua was going to lead the troops to Long Sea, I have been very nervous all this time.

430
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:43,580
His Highness's power is not lacking to the former High God Mo Yuan.

431
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:48,250
Why should you worry about the Merpeople Tribe?

432
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:52,330
In less than three days, you'll receive good news.

433
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:56,560
Women like to worry and overthink.

434
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:09,120
After I have departed, I hope you will take good care of yourself.

435
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:13,660
All right. All right.

436
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:18,300
I'm very safe here.

437
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,630
Don't worry about me,

438
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:24,600
for it might distract you from killing the enemies on the battlefield.

439
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:42,570
Your father is not here, so you'll just have to suffer for a little while.

440
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:46,180
We distinctly bowed to Heaven and Earth and became a married couple,

441
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:49,190
but he still can't bring me back to his family.

442
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:51,830
I'm just like a mistress.

443
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:54,510
I can't move around out there, either.

444
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:57,060
It's too devastating.

445
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,820
Greetings, Your Highness the Crown Prince.

446
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,760
I brought 30,000 elite soldiers from the Western Sea.

447
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,560
They are ready to listen to your command at any time.

448
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:50,290
Although I have only 10,000 soldiers from Long Sea, they are willing to fight for their lives.

449
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:53,930
They are ready to listen to your command at any time.

450
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:56,440
Greetings, Your Highness.

451
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:02,700
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

452
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,310
Su Jin is also ready to listen to your command.

453
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:07,350
What are you doing here?

454
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:13,220
70,000 years ago, my whole tribe sacrificed their lives for the Heavenly Tribe.

455
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:16,760
Now, all the chieftains of the other sub-tribes are here.

456
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,570
I'm the only one left of my Sujin Tribe.

457
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:21,380
I have gotten the permission of Heavenly Monarch to wear my armor and join the battlefield,

458
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:24,990
to move and retreat with all the other chieftains.

459
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:32,260
Princess Consort Su Jin, please come out with me.

460
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:47,580
Although you are my father's consort, I shouldn't talk much about you.

461
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:53,240
I still want to advise you that you can't even pick up your weapons.

462
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:58,180
You dress like this. Other than for appearance, what use does coming here have?

463
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:04,360
I want to live and die with His Highness the Crown Prince.

464
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,500
Su Jin,

465
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:11,140
do you still have feelings for Ye Hua?

466
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,540
Don't even talk about what's in your heart.

467
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:20,390
Since you have entered the palace to be my father's consort,

468
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:23,020
you'll never have any possibilities with Ye Hua.

469
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:27,490
Hence, I advise you to give up on this idea immediately.

470
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:33,140
In the past, Bai Qian was able to cancel her marriage agreement to Water Monarch of the Northern Sea and marry Ye Hua, instead.

471
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:37,260
Who can be sure about what will happen in the Heavenly Palace?

472
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,370
Absurd!

473
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,400
Two armies are fighting soon.

474
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,900
I only hope that you don't hinder Ye Hua.

475
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:50,590
Take care of yourself, Princess Consort Su Jin.

476
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:01,700
- We are sending out the troops tonight.
- What? We are sending out the troops tonight?

477
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:04,190
Your Highness, why are we in such a hurry?

478
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:06,660
Your Highness, the Heavenly Tribe's army just arrived here.

479
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,350
They are not familiar with Long Sea and its territorial waters.

480
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:11,500
The chieftain of the Merpeople Tribe have been here for 70,000 years. He also knows–

481
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:15,210
What you are thinking is exactly what the Merpeople Tribe are thinking.

482
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:18,390
They think we will rest for a few days before we send out the troops.

483
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:20,590
This is the time when they are most off guard.

484
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:24,030
Tonight is our best opportunity.

485
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:27,230
Quickly sort out the soldiers. We are sending out the troops tonight.

486
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:29,200
- Yes.
- Yes.

487
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:41,500
Ye Hua, I fear that Su Jin's appearance might affect your plan.

488
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,350
You must make your fake death very thorough.

489
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:46,680
Don't let her see any flaws.

490
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,230
There won't be any.

491
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:54,310
If you are hacked by that Soul Severing Blade of the Merpeople, you will surely die.

492
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:57,700
Are you planning to really get hacked by it?!

493
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,700
That's right.

494
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,000
You are hopeless.

495
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,860
You are even going to risk your life for her?

496
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,100
Third Uncle, don't worry.

497
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:13,240
I will make sure to accurately grasp the degree of my injury and make it look serious,

498
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,600
but it won't really be life-threatening.

499
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,980
Swords have no eyes.

500
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:20,820
How could you make it sound so easy?

501
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:31,000
I just beg that you do not forget to hide me in a remote area after this is over,

502
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,390
and report to Heavenly Monarch that my body has dissipated into dust.

503
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,900
I will ask you one last time:

504
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:51,940
After this war, Crown Prince Ye Hua will no longer exist in the Heavenly Palace.

505
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:54,150
Will you be content with that?

506
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:04,140
I only hope that I can extricate myself as soon as possible and never be shackled again.

507
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:35,090
”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

508
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:37,100
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

509
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,950
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

510
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:45,210
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

511
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:54,370
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

512
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:58,410
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

513
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:03,830
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

514
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:11,200
And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

515
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:15,600
♫ All are just illusions ♫

516
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:22,800
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

517
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:28,040
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

518
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:32,460
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

519
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:38,710
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

520
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:44,160
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

521
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:49,270
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

522
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:52,200
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

523
00:43:52,200 --> 00:44:00,990
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from my previous life ♫

524
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:13,330
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

525
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:18,700
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

526
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:23,110
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

527
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:29,400
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

528
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:34,690
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

529
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:40,070
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

530
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:42,780
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

531
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:51,610
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

532
00:44:53,430 --> 00:45:04,410
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
