00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:17,550
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,060
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,660
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,170
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,380
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,250
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,830
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,260
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,830
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:49,330
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:52,930
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:56,490
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:00,000
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,490
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:07,130
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:10,450
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:14,080
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,960
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,750
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:21,190
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:24,770
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:27,920
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,830
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,590
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,890
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,010
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:47,350
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

[Episode 15]

31
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,460
If you know me, you should know that

32
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:26,590
everything that I have done is to marry Ye Hua.

33
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:30,650
Your Highness, are you saying that...

34
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,570
Su Jin.

35
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,340
Heavenly Monarch.

36
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,890
I'm here to see you.

37
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,370
Heavenly Monarch, you need to deal with lots of problems every day.

38
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:50,050
You don't need to think too much about me.

39
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:53,950
Tonight, I will enter the palace alone according to your arrangement.

40
00:02:53,950 --> 00:03:00,110
No. I'm here to tell you that since we are husband and wife by name only,

41
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,090
you can continue to live in this palace

42
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:05,910
so that you won't feel uneasy staying in my bedroom palace.

43
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,570
This... is illogical.

44
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,360
It's not a problem.

45
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,180
Thank you, Heavenly Monarch.

46
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,440
Hang some red silk.

47
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,180
After all, being conferred as a heavenly consort is worth celebrating.

48
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,830
Yes. I will go and prepare now.

49
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,770
I have done injustice to you.

50
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,410
It's a stop-gap measure.

51
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:37,290
Heavenly Monarch, you don't need to blame yourself.

52
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,580
I was just thinking...

53
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,900
Why don't we make use of this joyous occasion?

54
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:46,690
Let me go back to my ancestor tribe to see my uncles first thing tomorrow morning.

55
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:50,570
We must let them know your kind intentions towards them.

56
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:53,970
Not bad.

57
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,790
Rest well tonight.

58
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:59,490
I will let Lian Song and Yang Cuo escort you there first thing tomorrow morning.

59
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:05,580
No. I think it's best to let the Crown Prince go instead.

60
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,300
Ye Hua?

61
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,080
That's right.

62
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,210
His Highness is the crown prince.

63
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:16,820
If His Highness shows up with me, it will attach great importance.

64
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:23,430
Even more so, don't you have the intention to let His Highness lead the troop in the war against the Merpeople Tribe?

65
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,350
It's always good for him to meet these chieftains in advance.

66
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,910
All right.

67
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:38,420
I will inform Ye Hua about this first thing tomorrow morning and let him meet those chieftains.

68
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,590
Thank you, Second Sister-in-Law.

[Grand Purple Palace]

70
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,520
I'm doing this as a last resort.

71
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:22,440
I'm doing this for the family.

72
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,210
I don't want to see the two brothers fighting against each other again.

73
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:09,430
Li Jing, even the younger sister that you dote on the most, will betray you, too.

74
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:20,030
Starting from now, in the Grand Purple Palace, I will be the closest to you.

75
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:29,860
I don't believe that even in this situation, I can't capture your heart.

76
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,850
Mighty Monarch.

77
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,060
You are drunk.

78
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,320
Do you want to...?

79
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:52,110
Your Highness, since you have obtained the command token, let's depart now.

80
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,500
Golden Lion,

81
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:02,210
if I rescue Eldest Brother,

82
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:08,960
will the hard-earned peace in the Winged Realm fall into turmoil again?

83
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,560
Your Highness, Second Prince ascended to the throne 70,000 years ago.

84
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,220
The foundation is firm.

85
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:20,250
Even if your father were still alive, it will be hard to shake his position.

86
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:25,060
We are doing this just to save the First Prince's life.

[Grand Purple Palace]

88
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:21,390
Emperor, I have something to say to you.

89
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:33,190
Today, Third Highness mentioned that in the Heavenly Realm, people often use repaying a kindness as an excuse to get closer to you.

90
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:35,550
But I'm not.

91
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:40,150
Since young, my parents have taught me that a small drop of kindness should be repaid as though it is a spring.

92
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:43,530
A life savior must be treated in this way, too.

93
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:48,780
Although I'm still young, I understand these principles.

94
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:58,900
My aunt also taught me that as immortals, we should not hide behind our reputation.

95
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,480
We should say what we truly think.

96
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:10,130
Today, Third Highness asked me again if I'm interested in you.

97
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,610
I deeply thought about it.

98
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,780
I do have that kind of feeling towards you.

99
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,600
Do you understand, Emperor?

100
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,600
Are you done talking?

101
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:46,540
Y-Yes.

102
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,550
Leave if you are done.

103
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:52,250
Huh?

104
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,440
Still not leaving?

105
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,420
I'll leave.

106
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:13,570
I wonder where this divine maid who came to pay gratitude is from.

107
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,250
She is the little empress of Green Hill, Bai Fengjiu.

108
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,030
Bai Fengjiu?

109
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:25,230
She is indeed someone we should not offend.

110
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:29,140
But how did you save her life?

111
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:33,840
- By chance.
- By chance?

112
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,680
I didn't think that she was actually royalty.

113
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,130
Don't look down on her.

114
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,410
She is the only grand-descendant of Green Hill.

115
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:49,540
In the future, she will rule at least one of the five wildernesses of Green Hill, becoming a monarchess.

116
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,890
So what?

117
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:56,510
You are just young, rash, and unable to see the situation.

118
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,580
You need to listen to me.

119
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:01,680
Don't ever wrong people from Green Hill.

120
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,020
Yes.

121
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:12,600
But Emperor Dong Hua, you have long ago decided to not meddle with worldly affairs.

122
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,700
Seems like the efforts of this little empress will be in vain.

123
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:23,900
I hear that Heavenly Monarch, you have taken Su Jin as a consort?

124
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,550
That's right.

125
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:31,680
It has been a while since we had a joyous occasion in the heavenly palace.

126
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:44,600
Su Su!

127
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:48,820
Ye Hua, leave quickly.

128
00:12:56,390 --> 00:13:01,340
Su Su, what did you do again?

129
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:04,620
I wanted to roast a chicken for you.

130
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,770
Didn't we agree to let me do it?

131
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:09,500
You always cooked for me.

132
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,580
I was embarrassed.

133
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,190
- Our wedding clothes!
- Don't go!

134
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:20,200
The fire is so big. Our wedding clothes would have already been destroyed.

135
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,750
But those are the clothes from our wedding. We only have this one in our lifetime.

136
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:27,050
If you like it, I will marry you repeatedly every day.

137
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:33,080
Ye Hua, you really know how to say romantic things.

138
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,420
Our house has burned down.

139
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,310
Where should we sleep tonight?

140
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:44,060
Where do you want to live?

141
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:48,240
I just want to live here.

142
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:01,170
Ye Hua, don't worry about me.

143
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:03,110
I'm not afraid of this fire.

144
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:06,460
I've even seen a little black dragon before.

145
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:09,320
It's really okay. Don't worry about me, Ye Hua.

146
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,120
You—

147
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,610
Where's the fire?

148
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,090
Who are you?

149
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:37,640
This...

150
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,730
You are not a monster, right?

151
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,610
No wonder when I first met you, I felt that you were different.

152
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:54,890
You had many serious wounds in your body and you recovered very quickly.

153
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,990
Ye Hua, you can't be...

154
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:08,130
the Golden Lion that was harming the citizens and caused the king to commit suicide, right?

155
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,430
Su Su, why do you think I'm a monster?

156
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,230
Why?

157
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,180
Are you scared of me?

158
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:38,000
Ye Hua, regardless of what kind of monster you are,

159
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,930
we have vowed to Heaven and Earth that we are a married couple.

160
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:46,520
Ye Hua, if you are really that Golden Lion,

161
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:51,190
then you must have fought with the little black dragon I took care of.

162
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:56,230
If that black dragon knows that you didn't die from your injuries, he will return to find you.

163
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:00,810
He knows this place very well. No. Let's leave now.

164
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:04,010
- Let's leave now.
- Su Su.

165
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:08,420
If I'm really a monster, will you still be with me?

166
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:14,310
Ye Hua, starting from now, don't say such things.

167
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:18,690
Since I have made an oath to follow you through all our lives,

168
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:23,330
and through joys and sorrows, I will never leave you, I don't care what you are.

169
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,070
Even in death, you are not afraid?

170
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,210
So what if I die?

171
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,560
This is what my personality is like.

172
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:41,060
Although I asked you to devote yourself to me that day so that I would have some company,

173
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:46,840
after interacting for many months, we have become husband and wife.

174
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:52,690
So, since we are husband and wife, I don't care if you are a human or monster.

175
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:55,590
I will still be with you.

176
00:16:55,590 --> 00:17:02,370
Even if you have done bad things that require you to pay with your life, I will follow you to pay with my life.

177
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:04,740
Isn't that the worst that could happen?

178
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,100
Say that again.

179
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:23,360
In this world, no matter what, no matter where,

180
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:28,730
as long as you don't betray me, I will never abandon you.

181
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,860
Ye Hua, we should hurry and escape.

182
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,230
No need to escape.

183
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,270
I'm not a monster.

184
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,310
You... are not a monster?

185
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,060
Su Su,

186
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:04,390
I'm an ordinary person.

187
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,150
What?

188
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:14,730
I am just a person trying to cultivate into an immortal, so I learned a little bit of magic.

189
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:24,080
What's wrong?

190
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,150
Disappointed?

191
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:30,090
It's not that.

192
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:35,690
I just... thought of at least a hundred ways we could escape.

193
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:41,960
How could monks like you marry?

[Pure Wutong Palace]

195
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,570
This is bad. Father Monarch is going to Pure Wutong Palace.

196
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,660
Greetings, Heavenly Monarch, Emperor.

197
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:25,030
Is the Crown Prince in the palace?

198
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,540
Yes.

199
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:32,220
Su Jin is getting married today.

200
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,780
Everyone is at the wedding reception.

201
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,970
It's improper that he's not there.

202
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:41,320
His Highness said he is tired and doesn't want to join the festivities, so we are not to bother him.

203
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:47,580
You go in to ask him to wake up and come greet the Emperor.

204
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,150
Yes.

205
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,030
- Wait. Wait.
- How presumptuous!

206
00:19:55,890 --> 00:20:01,360
You're a divine monarch. How dare you make such a fuss in front of the Emperor?

207
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,030
Father Monarch and Emperor, please forgive me.

208
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:06,360
I feared that if Ye Hua is trying to heal his injuries right now,

209
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,180
and this divine maid disturbs him, he might make a mistake and cause further damage.

210
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,760
Is that so?

211
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:16,620
His Highness has just fought with the Fiery Golden Lion.

212
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,830
How was he injured that seriously?

213
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:22,330
His injury is not that serious nor minor.

214
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:25,070
Enough. He's the crown prince of the Heavenly Tribe.

215
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:28,800
It's just a minor injury. No need to keep repeating this the whole day.

216
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,200
Go ask him to come out.

217
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,970
Yes.

Crown Prince, Your Highness.

Heavenly Monarch, Emperor, Third Uncle.

223
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,140
Ye Hua,

224
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:15,920
where are you?

225
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:48,530
When you came back yesterday, didn't you say it was a minor injury?

226
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,550
Why are you so pale?

227
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:58,770
Since I've been back from the mortal realm, I've been discussing with Third Uncle about the Merpeople Tribe.

228
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:00,890
I forgot to eat and sleep.

229
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,780
Good.

230
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:06,650
This is what the future Heavenly Monarch should do.

231
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:08,410
But you must remember to rest.

232
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:10,310
Yes.

233
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:22,750
I wonder why the both of you are here. What is it about?

234
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:26,360
It's to discuss your engagement with Green Hill.

235
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:33,030
That day, you suddenly bestowed the marriage,

236
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:36,810
and I didn't dare say anything in order to appease the Fox Emperor.

237
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:42,000
Since it's just Heavenly Monarch, Emperor, and Third Uncle here today,

238
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,560
I would like to be blunt with my words.

239
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:48,160
What's wrong?

240
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,990
You are not happy with this engagement?

241
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:53,720
I dare not.

242
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:07,050
Heavenly Monarch, when I was young,

243
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:11,570
my father always told me that I will succeed the future Heavenly Monarch position,

244
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:13,740
so I can't be compared with an ordinary person.

245
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:18,280
When Second Uncle Sang Ji was born, only 36 colored birds circled around.

246
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:23,210
But when I was born, 72 colored birds congratulated and celebrated it.

247
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:28,560
Heavenly Monarch, in front of the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses, you named me as the Crown Prince.

248
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:33,750
For countless years, I have been trembling with fear and dared not make any mistakes.

249
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:36,930
I was afraid of disappointing you and my father.

250
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,530
And you have definitely done well.

251
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:46,520
I aspire to be a wise ruler instead of being intoxicated with the relationship between men and women.

252
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:52,620
Hence, I think it's too early to get married now.

253
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:56,250
Please allow me to have another 20,000 years of training.

254
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:02,430
What you said does make sense.

255
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,690
Ye Hua.

256
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:10,330
Are you sincere in saying this?

257
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:12,120
It's really true.

258
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:18,920
Since young till now, this is the first time you have refuted me.

259
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:24,860
I'm not filial. Heavenly Monarch, please forgive me.

260
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:29,180
Ye Hua.

261
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,050
You don't want to marry Bai Qian of Green Hill.

262
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,950
Is there a reason you are not willing to tell?

263
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,450
I don't have any.

264
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:58,980
In the past, I doted on your Second Uncle the most.

265
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:03,640
But he has also disappointed me the most.

266
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,280
You know that, right?

267
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,050
I know.

268
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:12,400
I expended a lot of efforts on you over countless years more than the effort I spent on your Second Uncle.

269
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,950
more than the effort I spent on your Second Uncle.

270
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:20,420
Hence, you must not make any mistakes.

271
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:25,750
Especially, when it concerns women. Understand?

272
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,450
I understand.

273
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,880
It's good that you understand.

274
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:47,740
With regards to your engagement with Green Hill, let me think about it again.

275
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,700
Emperor, what do you think?

276
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,360
It's rather urgent.

277
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:02,350
The engagement was just decided and we immediately have to go discuss with them about the wedding ceremony.

278
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:07,560
I fear it might scare the Fox Emperor and make him think that our crown prince has some hidden illness

279
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,970
making us afraid that Green Hill will back out of this engagement.

00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,970
By the way,

282
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:31,160
I heard that you revealed your dragon form in the mortal realm.

283
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,950
Why did you do that?

284
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:36,870
Naturally, it was to defeat the Golden Lion.

285
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:39,130
When did I ask you?

286
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:44,400
I originally wanted to organize my thoughts first before reporting to you.

287
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:51,950
Didn't Mo Yuan give this weapon to his precious disciple in the past?

288
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:54,280
Kunlun Fan of Yuqing?

289
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,590
This is Kunlun Fan of Yuqing.

290
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:59,180
I met Winged Monarch Li Jing when I was in the mortal realm.

291
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,600
He was holding this.

292
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,770
Li Jing had it?

293
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:08,160
High God Mo Yuan's divine body and Si Yin went missing 70,000 years ago.

294
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,930
How did this magical weapon fall into the hands of the Winged Tribe?

295
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:13,480
I also found it rather strange.

296
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,440
That day, there were some twists and turns in my attempt to obtain the fan.

297
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,290
After displaying my dragon form, I wanted to return to Heavenly Palace to investigate this matter.

298
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:25,300
Perhaps, this fan can help us find the reason why High God Mo Yuan went missing.

299
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:29,790
High God Mo Yuan was the direct son of Father God and the master of Kunlun Void.

300
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:32,370
He should have been buried in the Sea of Innocence.

301
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:40,170
You must find out the truth but, since it's been so long, don't be impatient.

302
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:41,050
Yes.

You grew up together with her.

305

At the very least, you should drink some wedding wine to celebrate.

306

- Today?
- That's right.

307
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:58,200
Conferring her is a way to appease the branch chieftains.

308
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,620
The Merpeople Tribe has the intention to rebel.

309

A war can start at any time.

310
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,920
I was going to confer her sooner or later.

311
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,790
Congratulations, Heavenly Monarch.

312
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:13,860
Ye Hua, prepare to depart soon.

313

Escort the new consort to pay respects to her ancestors.

- Pay respects?
- Yes.

315
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:21,760
Paying respects is just a facade.

316
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,340
This is just a display for the branch chieftains to see.

00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,560
You are the next Heavenly Monarch.

318
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,260
You must have good relationships with them.

319
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:32,640
With Su Jin accompanying you, the relationships can be managed better.

320
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,710
After all, this chieftains especially dote on this descendant.

321
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,430
I understand.

322
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:47,750
I also had plans to meet them to make preparations for the war with the Merpeople Tribe.

323
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,460
Fine.

324
00:29:53,310 --> 00:30:01,610
My three sons can't even catch up with a good grandson like you.

325
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:26,530
Fortunately, you used the Kunlun Fan of Yuqing to avoid that crisis.

326
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:29,090
I obtained this fan by coincidence, too.

327
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:31,270
I didn't expect it to save me.

328
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:36,460
Looking at this fan, it really made me think of that High Immortal.

329
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,680
70,000 years ago at Ruoshui,

330
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,670
High Immortal Si Yin and I were comrades.

331
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:47,670
He and High God Mo Yuan... had a very strong teacher and disciple relationship.

332
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:54,030
Ye Hua, let's talk about something serious.

333
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,290
Third Uncle, please speak.

334
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:00,640
How should I say this?

335
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,180
Your father will never allow you to marry someone from the mortal realm.

336
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,120
You must think carefully.

337
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:10,360
You and her, when you are with her, it can only be out there.

338
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,580
One day in Heaven is a year in the mortal realm.

339
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,930
Are you going to use two months to be with her lifetime?

340
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:22,130
No, I want more than two months.

341
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,560
I knew you couldn't bear to leave her.

342
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,640
You want her to be with you for a long time.

343
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,130
Hence, you want to take her away from the mortal realm.

344
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:34,490
But, Ye Hua, you should know that all immortals know that you are going to marry Bai Qian of Green Hill.

345
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:36,560
You can't bring her here to Heaven.

346
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:41,040
You have your second uncle's example right before you.

347
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,460
I really feel guilty.

348
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:52,940
Why did I put you and Bai Qian of Green Hill together?

349
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:56,550
Looking at it now, I dug a hole for you to be buried.

350
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:58,060
Third Uncle,

351
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:04,510
even if there's no Bai Qian of Green Hill, there will be another.

352
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:08,230
When I was born, I was already set to be the next Heavenly Monarch.

353
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:13,140
Whether there's an engagement or not, Heavenly Monarch will never let me marry a mortal.

354
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,650
Not bad.

355
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:19,210
At that time, your Second Uncle and that snake were considered lucky and their lives were saved.

356
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:23,120
If Heavenly Monarch finds out that you fell in love with a mortal,

357
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:27,810
that person whom you love can neither live nor die and be miserable.

358
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:31,220
Let's not talk about this first.

359
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,340
I must go back to Junji Mountain.

360
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,130
You can't.

361
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,880
Heavenly Monarch just instructed you to accompany Su Jin to visit her ancestors.

362
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,830
Everyone in the palace is preparing for this. If you leave, you will be exposed.

363
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,350
But Su Su doesn't know about the situation.

364
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:48,220
I left suddenly, she must be extremely anxious.

365
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,600
Anxious just from that?

366
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,420
How will she face Heavenly Monarch later on?

367
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,220
But...

368
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,870
Someone's here.

369
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:03,070
Ye Hua, I really didn't imagine that Su Jin, this brat, could become Father's consort.

370
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:05,560
I thought she was going to marry you.

371
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,880
God really makes fools out of people.

372
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,420
Ye Hua.

373
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,820
Ye Hua.

374
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,720
Ye Hua.

375
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,920
Ye Hua.

376
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:53,740
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

377
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:58,660
Third Highness...

378
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:02,350
Heavenly Consort Su Jin.

379
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:08,740
To Your Third Highness, I'm still the same Su Jin.

380
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,790
Sit.

381
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:34,490
I wonder when we can set off, Your Highness.

382
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,250
Heavenly Monarch just instructed.

383
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:47,290
I have nothing to do, so I will accompany you and Ye Hua on the journey.

384
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:49,990
Heavenly Consort, do you mind?

385
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,740
Third Highness, do you want to go, too?

386
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:54,280
That's right.

387
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:58,560
Heavenly Monarch just said that

388
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,030
you are a descendant of brave heroes. Your whole tribe fought for justice for Heaven and Earth.

389
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:03,110
They risked their head and bled their passionate blood.

390
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:05,530
Our Heavenly Tribe should treat you well.

391
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:07,470
You are the Heavenly Consort now.

392
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:11,930
With these two relationships, of course, I need to go with you.

393
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:16,390
Thank you, Third Highness, for attaching importance to this.

394
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:20,050
Let's cut the idle talk, then. Let's leave early and come back soon.

395
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:27,600
Since the travel is quite far, I've already received permission from Heavenly Monarch to stay in the adjacent palace for the night.

396
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:33,900
I just fear that traveling back and forth is too bumpy and would cause His Highness exhaustion.

397
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,600
Stay for a night?

398
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,090
Yes, it will be hard for Your Highness.

399
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,530
Your Young Highness.

400
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:44,990
You are...?

401
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:49,670
Your Young Highness, I really didn't know that you were here to gain experiences under the Emperor.

402
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:52,020
I was disrespectful to Your Young Highness in the past.

403
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,900
Please don't take this to heart.

404
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:57,160
I'm apologizing to Your Young Highness.

405
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:58,960
Gain experience?

406
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,600
Yes, the Emperor issued the instruction today.

407
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:06,970
He said that you wanted to hide your identity and came here to Early Dawn Palace to observe the daily activities of maids,

408
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:08,960
that's why you temporarily stayed here.

409
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,720
Did the Emperor tell you this?

410
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:16,460
Emperor also told us to escort you in choosing a room here where you want to stay.

411
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:19,720
I'm not staying anywhere else. I like it here.

412
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:23,890
Your Young Highness, as the granddaughter of an emperor, how could you live with us?

413
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,930
I want to live with all of you.

414
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:28,430
That's why it's called gaining experience.

415
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:29,500
This...

416
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,750
I'll tell the Emperor myself.

417
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,270
- Your Young Highness!
- Your Young Highness!

418
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:35,730
- What should we do?
- That's right.

419
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:58,200
I think that since I'm here to repay your kindness, I should do it properly.

420
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,620
I must temporarily forget that I'm a granddaughter of an emperor.

421
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:05,480
Hence, I ask you to allow me to live with your divine maidservants.

422
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:11,070
I won't stop you if you really want to live with them.

423
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:13,540
Thank you for fulfilling my wish.

424
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:19,830
Are you here really to repay your gratitude?

425
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:21,560
That's right.

426
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,710
A drop of kindness should be repaid with an everlasting lake.

427
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:32,410
Then how would you repay someone for saving your life?

428
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:37,220
Saving my life? Well—

429
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:42,270
If you're just going to serve teas and water, I fear that it might need you to 100,000 years of serving teas

430
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:46,630
and 200,000 years of pouring water here in Early Dawn Palace for it to be enough.

431
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:54,250
Then, do you have an unfulfilled wish in mind?

432
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:55,790
I do.

433
00:37:55,790 --> 00:38:00,120
What is it? I'll do my best to help.

434
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:06,610
70,000 years ago, High God Mo Yuan gifted me this tea set.

435
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:11,040
I've always wanted to repay him for this tea set.

436
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,190
Can you help me to do it?

437
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,120
High God Mo Yuan?

438
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:20,580
What a shame... He's been retired for a long time.

439
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,840
No one knows where he is.

440
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:28,780
Frankly, High God Mo Yuan...

441
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:36,060
Wait. Is he trying to deceive me?

442
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:40,350
Unless he already knows that Aunt is Si Yin?

443
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:44,060
And also knows that Mo Yuan is in Green Hill?

444
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,890
When High God Mo Yuan disappeared, I was just born.

445
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:53,210
I don't have a clue as to where he is.

446
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:55,590
Do you have other wishes?

447
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:00,720
The second wish?

448
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:05,700
- I do have one.
- Please speak.

449
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:10,930
Tell me the relationship between your aunt and Mo Yuan.

450
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:18,380
Didn't I tell you that my aunt has nothing to do with Kunlun Void?

451
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:23,160
That's right. I forgot.

452
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:28,620
You keep telling me that your aunt has nothing to do with Kunlun Void.

453
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:35,400
Why are you so interested in High God Mo Yuan?

454
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:40,230
Other than High God Mo Yuan, don't you have other wishes?

455
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:45,930
I have no desires, so my wishes...

456
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:48,070
I can't think of anything else.

457
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:51,040
Take some time to think about it. I'm not in a hurry.

458
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,400
I know.

459
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,430
There's still something else.

460
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:02,730
Have you seen the Kunlun Fan of Yuqing?

461
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,900
What's that?

462
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,060
The name sounds strange.

463
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:15,230
I will help you wash the teacup.

464
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:44,620
Strange. Why does the Emperor keep asking me about the relationship between Mo Yuan and Aunt?

465
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,330
What are you doing?

466
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,870
You... How dare you treat me like this?!

467
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:51,540
You're so impudent!

468
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,380
- Oh no.
- You!

469
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,380
Why didn't you make a sound?

470
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,970
Hey! You poured tea on me.

471
00:40:57,970 --> 00:40:59,520
Why are you blaming me?

472
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,040
You're so unruly!

473
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,370
Don't think that because you're an empress of Green Hill, you can make up some excuses for repaying a kindness,

474
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:06,950
and come and go here in the Heavenly Palace as you like!

475
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:11,420
This is not Green Hill! Don't think you can act as you like!

476
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:14,680
This cup was given to the Emperor by High God Mo Yuan.

477
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:19,110
The ruckus is giving me a headache.

478
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:28,300
Greetings, Emperor Dong Hua.

479
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,930
According to cousin's servants,

480
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:33,120
you and Heavenly Monarch went to cousin's Purple Morning Palace this morning

481
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,550
to talk about Cousin and Bai Qian's marriage.

482
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:37,030
That's right.

483
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:45,250
- Is His Highness going to marry my aunt?
- Yes.

484
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:48,480
Then are you going to meet her family?

485
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:51,840
Of course.

486
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,820
Do you have any other questions?

487
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,830
I don't have anymore.

488
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:57,230
I... I have one!

489
00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:00,510
- I want to ask—
- If you have nothing urgent, you should leave.

490
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:03,260
I need to handle the affairs of Early Dawn Palace.

491
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:07,210
Okay, I'm taking my leave.

492
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:14,040
Fengji,

493
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:20,240
you broke the teacup given to me by High God Mo Yuan.

494
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:24,460
How does Your Young Highness plan to pay this debt?

495
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:27,510
Do we also add this to the debt of saving your life?

496
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,580
Can you do that?

497
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:47,150
Aunt, your teacher Mo Yuan needs to come back soon.

498
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:51,710
Otherwise, I won't ever be able to repay this debt, even in three lifetimes.

499
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:23,550
”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

500
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:25,530
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

501
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:28,270
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

502
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:33,660
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

503
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:42,680
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

504
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:46,940
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

505
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:52,210
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

506
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:59,610
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

507
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:04,180
♫ All are just illusions ♫

508
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:11,270
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

509
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:16,490
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

510
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:20,950
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

511
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:27,140
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

512
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:32,610
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

513
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:37,770
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

514
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:40,550
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

515
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:50,340
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from my previous life ♫

516
00:44:56,490 --> 00:45:01,730
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

517
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:07,090
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

518
00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:11,540
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

519
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:17,850
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

520
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:23,190
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

521
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:28,390
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

522
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:31,250
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

523
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:40,200
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

524
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:52,870
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
