”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,580
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,140
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,640
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,060
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:31,430
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:35,170
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,800
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,370
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:46,000
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,460
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,990
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:56,390
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,030
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,480
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,050
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:10,600
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,110
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:16,010
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,660
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,190
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:24,670
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,830
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:31,920
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,350
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,350
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:42,050
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:46,610
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

[Eternal Love]

30
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,070
[Episode 56]

31
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,500
You didn't expect this, did you?

32
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:22,610
Even if I couldn't injure you, wouldn't this Double-Sided Halberd hurt you?

33
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:27,400
Li Jing, I want your life!

34
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,510
Excellent.

35
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:38,770
You are indeed my good son.

36
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:42,990
I didn't expect to charge out from the Donghuang Bell that soon.

37
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,320
Fortunately, it's due to you.

38
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:52,500
You only need to give me your life and I'll get the 70,000-year cultivation.

39
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:58,810
Today is the day that I take revenge!

40
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,500
The people in Heaven dared to betray me.

41
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,020
You dared to betray me, too.

42
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:38,610
Once my soul is returned and I break out from the Donghuang Bell,

43
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:44,610
it will be the day the Red Lotus Fire destroys the Eight Wildernesses and the entire universe.

44
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,560
It's the Red Lotus Fire. Winged Monarch is back!

45
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,630
- Winged Monarch is back!
- Winged Monarch is back!

46
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,100
Jiu'er!

47
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:11,110
Emperor, what's wrong with Young Highness?

48
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,820
- Quick. Go to Kunlun Void and find Mo Yuan.
- Yes.

49
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,490
No, it's too late.

50
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,890
Go to Green Hill. It's the closest.

51
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,360
Bai Qian knows the Sealing Spell, too.

52
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,190
Yes.

53
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,890
Tian Shu, listen to my order.

54
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,710
I'm here.

55
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,510
Great Lady, His Highness the Crown Prince is still standing at the entrance of the den.

56
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,480
He hasn't moved at all.

57
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,360
If you dare to mention this name again,

58
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,610
I will beat you to your original form.

59
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,310
Why did the sky suddenly change, Mi Gu?

60
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:17,560
Great Lady, I don't know.

61
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,720
Is he still out there?

62
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,470
Yes, Great Lady.

63
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:28,590
He is out there beaten by the weather.

64
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,200
Emperor,

65
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,070
if we die here today,

66
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:56,820
Heaven won't be able to manage.

67
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,720
With me here, you won't die.

68
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:08,290
Later, I will use my spirit to block him for a while.

69
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:12,050
I lost most of my divine power. I can only block him for a short period of time.

70
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:16,870
You must leave now to find your aunt and fourth uncle.

71
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,130
- No, I'm not leaving.
- Stop messing around.

72
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,990
I'm not messing around.

73
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:26,360
I already said that I would live and die with you.

74
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,050
No one can live and die with me.

75
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,400
In order to protect the people, I severed my predestined marriage.

76
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,620
If I force you to be with me, there will be constant battles in the Four Seas.

77
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,540
People's lives will be in misery.

78
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,930
We will not end well.

79
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:44,510
Bai Fengjiu, you are not an ordinary woman.

80
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:48,120
You are the future monarchess of Green Hill. Stop messing around.

81
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,810
I'm not.

82
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:52,380
Dong Hua, if you live, I will live.

83
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,940
If you die, I will die.

84
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:58,380
If you can seal Qing Cang now, I won't stop you.

85
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,910
The worst is that I'll die with you, but you can't fight him now.

86
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,490
You can't even defeat him at all.

87
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:06,330
I can't let you die in vain.

88
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,140
- Don't go.
- Move aside!

89
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,750
Unless you beat me to death.

90
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,740
I want everyone under the sun to die for me today.

91
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,700
You won't be able to escape from me.

92
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,460
Jiu'er!

93
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:51,330
Jiu'er! Jiu'er!

94
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,650
Great Lady, step out and take a look, even if it's just a glance.

95
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,580
I am unable to take this first step.

96
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,270
Star Monarch Si Ming requests to see Great Lady.

97
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:07,780
Something bad has happened at the bank of Ruoshui River.

98
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,700
- What did you say?
- There's an anomaly in the Donghuang Bell.

99
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,330
Emperor said Great Lady is the only one who knows how to seal Qing Cang.

100
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,770
Qing Cang removed the seal?

101
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,480
When I just came, he didn't, but it looks like he's going to soon.

102
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,730
Mi Gu, relay a message to Fourth Older Brother and tell him to help me at Ruoshui.

103
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:22,330
- Yes.
- Qian Qian!

104
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:34,380
Protect the Emperor!

105
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,150
Tutelary! High God Mo Yuan couldn't defeat him then.

106
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:53,180
We are only junior immortals. How can we take him on?

107
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,290
I'm the Tutelary here.

108
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:58,240
Even if I can't defeat him, I must fight till death, too.

109
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,530
Even if I die fighting, I must fight till the end, too.

110
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,080
- Tutelary.
- Qing Cang!

111
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,050
I've guarded you for 70,000 years.

112
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:11,040
Give up on escaping from here and bringing disaster to the universe!

113
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,220
Tutelary!

114
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,610
- Great Lady.
- Move aside.

115
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,540
Si Yin, is that you?

116
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,160
Yes, Qing Cang. It's me.

117
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,660
I didn't expect that it hasn't been 300 years after I sealed you and you are escaping.

118
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,450
I have been waiting for you and Mo Yuan to come.

119
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:51,830
The both of you detained me here for more than 70,000 years.

120
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,270
I want to pay off old scores.

121
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,730
I want both of your lives!

122
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:59,710
What an overbearing tone.

123
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,170
What magic weapon did you use? Release me now!

124
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:13,640
Based on your cultivation, you won't be able to fight Qing Cang. Let me do it.

125
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,660
You gave Teacher all your cultivation.

126
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,100
You are less able to fight him.

127
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,720
Watch over her.

128
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,150
Ye Hua!

129
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:26,480
Ye Hua! Ye Hua!

130
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,020
Untie me now. He's seeking death.

131
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,760
High Goddess, don't panic. This magic weapon is odd.

132
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,540
I can't untie it.

133
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,510
Call Emperor Dong Hua for me.

134
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:40,650
Currently, Emperor Dong Hua lost his divine power and is even worse than me.

135
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,600
Emperor?

136
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,980
Young Highness?

137
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:56,220
Qing Cang, if you want to fight, come out now.

138
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:01,300
Mo Yuan, you are finally here.

139
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,860
Who are you? You are not Mo Yuan.

140
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,030
I'm Ye Hua, the Crown Prince of the Heavenly Tribe.

141
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:14,370
What?! Qing Cang is out again?!

142
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,820
Look! Our Winged Monarch is back.

143
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:53,520
Kill everyone and the universe will be ours.

144
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,120
Winged soldiers, stop being savages.

145
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,150
Fourth Older Brother!

146
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:18,390
- Winged Monarch!
- Ye Hua!

147
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:23,560
Rascal, I lost to you today.

148
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,590
I'm not happy.

149
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:30,890
If I weren't heavily injured 70,000 years ago,

150
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:35,290
if my vitality wasn't injured by my ungrateful son today,

151
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:37,990
I wouldn't have lost to you.

152
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:40,000
Ye Hua.

153
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,550
Eventually, you still lost.

154
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:47,400
Ye Hua lost a lot of his cultivation and he could still defeat Qing Cang.

155
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,130
- Winged Monarch!
 - Winged Monarch!

156
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:52,070
- Winged Monarch!
- Winged Monarch!

157
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:55,480
Ye Hua!

158
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,470
Qing Cang, what did you do?

159
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:26,020
I used 70,000 years of time to connect my life with the Donghuang Bell.

160
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:40,530
If I die, this Donghuang Bell will emit the Red Lotus Fire and bury you with me.

161
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,050
Ye Hua!

162
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,830
- Ye Hua!
- Qian Qian! Qian Qian!

163
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,960
Ye Hua!

164
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:12,540
- Qian Qian, you can't go!
- Come back!

165
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,020
Ye Hua!

166
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:21,360
Ye Hua, come back!

167
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,800
- Ye Hua!
- You can't go!

168
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,810
- Ye Hua!
- Qian Qian!

169
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:31,440
Come back, Ye Hua!

170
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:42,860
Ye Hua!

171
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,660
Ye Hua!

172
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,100
Ye Hua.

173
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,630
Don't cry.

174
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,760
I am fine.

175
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,230
This level of injury is nothing.

176
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:36,370
Ye Hua! Ye Hua! Ye Hua!

177
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:39,480
Ye Hua. Ye Hua.

178
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:46,060
You are trying to swallow your blood again, right?

179
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,730
How old are you?

180
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:52,110
It's fine even if you are weak.

181
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,650
Ye Hua.

182
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,250
Tell me the truth.

183
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:10,420
Are you going to die?

184
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,450
Ye Hua.

185
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:19,300
Mo Yuan is awake.

186
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:23,930
You can be together with him.

187
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:28,680
He... He will take care of you.

188
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:33,730
He will do it better than me.

189
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:38,040
I'm at ease.

190
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,610
- No.
- Qian Qian.

191
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,340
Qian Qian.

192
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:56,680
From the start till the end, you are the only one I have loved.

193
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:03,850
Don't... forget me.

194
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,540
Don't...

195
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:10,550
Don't. Don't forget me.

196
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,230
Don't, Ye Hua.

197
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:22,820
Don't die. Hang in there.

198
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,660
Hang in there. I'll take you to see Teacher.

199
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:30,010
Teacher will definitely have a solution, Ye Hua.

200
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:32,290
Ye Hua.

201
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,750
Don't die.

202
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,540
I beg you, don't die.

203
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:40,480
If you die...

204
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,110
If you die, I will look for Zhe Yan and get the medicinal water.

205
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:49,060
I will forget you.

206
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,620
I will do well on my own.

207
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,880
I don't want to think of you anymore.

208
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:58,070
Do you hear me?

209
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,350
This is good, too.

210
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,000
Ye Hua.

211
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:20,270
Ye Hua!

212
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,330
Ye Hua.

213
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,200
Don't die.

214
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,850
Ye Hua, open your eyes.

215
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,300
Ye Hua!

216
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,940
Heavenly Monarch!

217
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,710
Qing Cang propelled Donghuang Bell and summoned the Red Lotus Fire to destroy the land.

218
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:20,250
His Highness the Crown Prince used his spirit as a sacrifice to the Donghuang Bell.

219
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,980
What? You said the crown prince—

220
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:32,550
How could this happen? Didn't Emperor Dong Hua say that the seal would only be unblocked 70,000 years later?

221
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,730
His Highness the Crown Prince seems to have found out earlier.

222
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:39,500
Before he left for the Mortal Realm for tribulation, he had told Tian Shu to guard Donghuang Bell day and night.

223
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:43,410
We didn't expect that when he just left for the Mortal Realm—

224
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:52,680
Le Xu! Le Xu.

225
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:20,830
Teacher, did you hear the bell?

226
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:23,810
I heard a bell lamenting. It seems to be coming from Ruoshui River.

227
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:26,990
- It's the Donghuang Bell.
- Teacher.

228
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:30,860
Could it be that Qing Cang came out again?

229
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,650
Teacher! Teacher!

230
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:34,510
You can't go. Let us go instead.

231
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:37,000
It has ended.

232
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:43,750
Someone used his spirit as a sacrifice for the Donghuang Bell.

233
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:56,400
So what if Donghuang Bell opened up again?

234
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,650
So what if the immortals of the Eight Wildernesses would be burned and become extinct?

235
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:02,890
After all, we two are together.

236
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:07,030
Why do you leave me behind, Ye Hua?

237
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:10,270
How could you leave me alone?

238
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:15,760
With Young Fifth's stubborn personality, if this continues on, she will definitely die.

239
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,860
Look! What should we do?

240
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,770
I don't know.

241
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:25,840
Previously, it was her teacher.

242
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,510
Now it's her future husband.

243
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:35,060
Young Fifth keeps going through life and death in this lifetime.

244
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:38,910
Right. She was about to be married to Ye Hua.

245
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:41,180
Now, what should we do?

246
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:44,650
High Gods.

247
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:49,970
I'm waiting for the Heavenly Monarch's orders to retrieve His Highness the Crown Prince's corpse.

248
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:53,760
Please make a decision.

249
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,610
Everyone, go back.

250
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:05,220
I can see that she's going to hug His Highness the Crown Prince and sit on the bank of Ruoshui forever.

251
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:21,010
Aunt.

252
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:23,850
Aunt, be more open. Okay?

253
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:26,460
A dead person won't come back to life, Aunt.

254
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,650
You still have me.

255
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:30,360
You still have uncles.

256
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,340
You still have everyone at Green Hill, Aunt.

257
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,810
Aunt!

258
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:43,370
Aunt, don't be like this.

259
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:46,580
If you are like this, I'm scared.

260
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:52,540
Aunt! Aunt!

261
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,940
How is it?

262
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:16,620
Your disciple is deeply in love.

263
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:19,130
No one can persuade her.

264
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:28,700
Seventeenth.

265
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,940
Teacher, you're here.

266
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:48,850
You know a way to save Ye Hua, right?

267
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:51,920
You also suffered the tribulation from the Donghuang Bell.

268
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,460
So you must have a way.

269
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,100
Seventeenth,

270
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:13,350
get a coffin to let Ye Hua leave in peace.

271
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,950
Teacher, don't joke around.

272
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,290
I can wait.

273
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:35,480
Not mentioning 70,000 years, I can wait for him no matter how long it'll be.

274
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,800
Teacher.

275
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,250
He's gone.

276
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:55,000
When you used your spirit as a sacrifice to the Donghuang Bell back then,

277
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,730
they also said your soul dispersed.

278
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:05,350
But I still brought you back.

279
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,520
Ye Hua will come back, too.

280
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:15,660
He will.

281
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:25,430
Even if we want to wait, you should make him comfortable.

282
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:30,360
Sitting here is not a long-term solution.

283
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,790
You're right.

284
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:39,830
I promised Ye Hua before that

285
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:50,570
I wanted to bring him to Green Hill and lock him in my fox den,

286
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:53,970
so he could only see me day and night.

287
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:01,820
I'll take him to Green Hill now.

288
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:08,840
Go back first.

289
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:20,540
- Aunt!
- What should we do?

290
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:23,660
- That's right.
- This!

291
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:30,160
Emperor.

292
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,050
Go.

293
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:45,420
- What's going on?
- What should we do?

294
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:48,050
- What should we do?
- That's right.

295
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:51,410
- We can complete our mission.
- This is bad.

296
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:53,690
What should we do?

297
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:10,720
Dear Immortals, this is the residence of the past dynasties of Green Hill's monarchs.

298
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,560
Our Great Lady is the monarchess of Green Hill for Five Wildernesses.

299
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:22,800
Although there are less rules in Green Hill than in the Heavenly Tribe, no one is allowed to enter the monarchess' residence.

300
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,920
About this...

301
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,260
What should we do?

302
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:34,750
We understand she's the monarchess of Green Hill and the crown prince's fiance.

303
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:38,520
It's just that... His Highness the Crown Prince is not an ordinary immortal.

304
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,250
He's our crown prince of Nine Heavens.

305
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:45,660
Now, the Heavenly Monarch sent us to escort His Highness the Crown Prince back.

306
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,860
But Great Lady...

307
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:53,830
Little Immortal, it's hard on us as well.

308
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:56,170
- That's right!
- That's right!

309
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:58,080
That's right.

310
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:04,660
Can you ask Great Lady to give us His Highness the Crown Prince's corpse?

311
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:10,730
Our Great Lady already said that no one is allowed in.

312
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:14,630
Please go back.

313
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:16,720
This is too much.

314
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,120
- We can't complete our mission.
- That's right.

315
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:26,430
It looks like Great Lady is not willing to hand over His Highness the Crown Prince to us.

316
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:28,500
It's been 10 days.

317
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:32,570
I think we should report back to the Heavenly Palace first.

318
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:35,500
About this...

319
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:56,090
Great Lady, Ah Li is still at the Heavenly Palace.

320
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:59,540
Do we want to bring him to Green Hill?

321
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:03,850
Can't you see that I'm taking care of Ye Hua?

322
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,500
I don't know how to persuade you, either.

323
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:31,150
High God.

324
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,670
Our Great Lady is like this day and night.

325
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:37,420
What if she gets sick?

326
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:39,990
I'll prescribe a medicine for you.

327
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:43,060
You decoct it and let her drink it.

328
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,140
Let her sleep first.

329
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:47,350
I'll go do it now.

330
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:13,390
Su Jin, as the guardian of the bell, you failed to carry out your duties with dedication

331
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:16,230
and report it timely to Heaven,

332
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:19,040
which caused Ye Hua to fight Qing Cang alone and without any help.

333
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,650
He even sacrificed his spirit for the Donghuang Bell.

334
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:23,860
How do you plead?!

335
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:29,190
I saw that there were so many high dods,

336
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:32,030
I didn't want to cause trouble.

337
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:36,190
I wasn't useful at all.

338
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:45,010
Your tribe helped the Heavenly Tribe knowing that it would be their demise,

339
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:47,810
but they still willingly went.

340
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:54,400
But you aren't like your parents one bit.

341
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:58,200
I'm disappointed in you.

342
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:02,720
Heavenly Monarch, please let me off this time!

343
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:07,110
Please let me go, Heavenly Monarch!

344
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:19,690
Guards.

345
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,730
Heavenly Monarch.

346
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:32,600
Based on the law of the Heavenly Tribe, you are demoted to leave Nine Heavens!

347
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:41,140
- Take her down.
- Yes.

348
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:59,390
High Goddess Bai Qian is a noble and distinguished person.

349
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:04,760
Those people whom I sent there are afraid of giving her a hard time.

350
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:17,660
Could Emperor respectfully go to Green Hill to help my two sons and bring Ye Hua back?

351
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:28,230
I was there at the battle of Ruoshui, too.

352
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,360
At that time...

353
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,990
Forget it.

354
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:40,000
Since you've personally asked, I'll go with you two then.

355
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,480
I want to go, too.

356
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:48,470
With Emperor and us there, you don't need to go.

357
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:58,420
I want to go see what I need to do in order for that Su Su, Bai Qian, to return to me, my son.

358
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:02,800
My poor son.

359
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,990
Is it done?

360
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:25,710
I wonder if Zhe Yan's medicine will work and let Aunt sleep for a day.

361
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,340
I'm worried if this goes on,

362
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:31,940
Heaven will send Heavenly Soldiers to take His Highness the Crown Prince back by force.

363
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:34,410
Who knows?

364
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:38,990
Who touched my divine barrier?

365
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:09,790
Greetings, Emperor Dong Hua, First Highness, Third Highness, Lady Le Xu.

366
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:13,980
Could you please notify Great Lady that we're here to bring Ye Hua back to the palace?

367
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,240
All right. Please wait here, Emperor.

368
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,590
I'll go tell Great Lady now.

369
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:45,250
Stop! Le Xu.

370
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:51,680
High Goddess Bai Qian, I'm here today to ask an unreasonable request.

371
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,010
Although I know that you and Ye Hua are deeply in love,

372
00:38:55,010 --> 00:39:01,500
the Heavenly Monarch and Ye Hua's parents haven't seen him ever since he passed away.

373
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,060
Heavenly Monarch dotes on his first grandson.

374
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:07,140
When he heard about this, he was in great pain.

375
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,090
He's an old man.

376
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,380
It's been many days.

377
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,620
He hasn't seen his grandson's corpse.

378
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:18,640
Whether it's emotional or rational, it's not proper.

379
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:30,470
So... you're all here to take Ye Hua away?

380
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:31,900
That's right.

381
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:38,880
Ye Hua's parents have prepared an Icy Mystic Crystal Coffin to take him back

382
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,580
and deliver it to the scared land of the Heavenly Tribe, the Sea of Innocence, for people to worship.

383
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,830
You can't take him.

384
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:54,760
He promised me to let me bring him back here.

385
00:39:55,930 --> 00:40:04,830
As soon as I knew you were that mortal Su Su, I was very worried.

386
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:09,900
Who knew, this still happened.

387
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:18,600
I wonder what consequence of evil Ye Hua created to fall twice into your hands.

388
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:24,090
When you were the mortal, Su Su, he suffered so much for you.

389
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:26,930
He was even willing to give up being the crown prince!

390
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:29,450
For the debts between you and Princess Zhaoren,

391
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:33,390
Heavenly Monarch made you give your eyes to her

392
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:37,930
and suffer 3 months of lightening after giving birth to Ah Li.

393
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:41,590
You just gave her your eyes.

394
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:45,630
Ye Hua suffered lightning for you!

395
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:53,550
And you went and jumped off the Immortal Execution Platform.

396
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:57,750
Ye Hua jumped with you, too.

397
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:01,810
It was all a tribulation for you to ascend to a high goddess,

398
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:04,280
but what did Ye Hua get out of it?

399
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:11,290
He's never had a moment of happiness since he's met you.

400
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:17,470
He's given up so much for you, but what about you?

401
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:21,580
You haven't given anything up.

402
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:30,990
You just stuck to him and now that he's dead, you're sticking to his corpse!

403
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:33,690
I have one thing to say.

404
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:39,210
Bai Qian, what gives you the right?!

405
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,370
That's enough.

406
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,290
My son killed the Winged Monarch Qing Cang

407
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:57,990
and used his spirit to prevent the Donghuang Bell from destroying Nine Heavens.

408
00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:00,650
That was to die for Heaven and Earth.

409
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:02,490
Heavenly Monarch has made it clear.

410
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:05,520
What Le Xu said, it was just an opinion of a woman.

411
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,560
High Goddess, please don't take this to heart.

412
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,520
However, it's not appropriate for High Goddess to take possession of my son's body.

413
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:16,630
Although my son was engaged to you, you were not married to him yet.

414
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:21,140
You taking possession of my son's body isn't proper whether it's emotional or rational.

415
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:24,330
My son was born as the crown prince of the Heavenly Tribe.

416
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:27,990
Our Heavenly Palace has a rule that can't be abolished.

417
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:35,500
Hence, could you please let us take him back and bury him at Sea of Innocence in the Thirty-Six Heaven?

418
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,230
Please grant our wish, High Goddess.

419
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:09,390
”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

420

♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

421
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:14,030
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

422
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:19,400
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

423
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:28,890
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

424
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:32,760
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

425
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:38,040
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

426
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:43,600
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

427
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:50,500
♫ All are just illusions ♫

428
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:57,000
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

429
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:02,200
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

430
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:06,680
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

431
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:12,860
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

432
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:18,180
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

433
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:23,510
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

434
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:26,360
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

435
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:35,870
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from
my previous life ♫

436
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:47,440
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

437
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:52,880
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:57,390
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

439
00:44:57,390 --> 00:45:03,520
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

440
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:08,850
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

441
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:14,270
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

442
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:17,070
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

443
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:26,120
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

444
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:38,360
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
