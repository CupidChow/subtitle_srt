”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

2
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:17,570
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,970
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,610
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:28,010
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:31,490
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:35,170
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,830
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,280
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,830
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:49,410
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,050
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:56,350
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,970
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:03,480
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,910
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,430
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:14,000
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,020
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,810
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:21,270
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:24,760
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,880
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,780
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,370
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:38,910
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,070
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:46,870
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:12,820
[Episode 51]

31
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,950
Teacher.

32
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,610
I tidied up the Pellet-Cultivating Room.

33
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:32,210
Thanks to your senior brothers.

34
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:35,900
Kunlun Void has returned to its original state.

35
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:41,780
Being with everyone daily, it seems like we have gone back to the past.

36
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,910
Frankly, I was just thinking.

37
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:53,430
This was the place where you withstood three bolts of heavenly lightning for me.

38
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,590
You can't remember the battle formations and spells that I taught you,

39
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,600
but you remembered this minor matter.

40
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:09,080
Teacher, I will never forget your kindness.

41
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:14,990
In the future, I will always be filial to you.

42
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,010
Filial?

43
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,780
Teacher, are you thirsty?

44
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,680
I'll go brew a pot of tea for you.

45
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,760
No need.

46
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,990
Go back to work.

47
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,760
All right. I won't disturb you then.

48
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,970
I'm leaving.

49
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,040
Why am I cornered by you again?

50
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:54,710
I taught you zither, painting, and calligraphy. You want to defeat me?

51
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,680
It won't be easy.

52
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,600
Fourth Older Brother, this is known as "a beaten army in total collapse."

53
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,400
You are pacing up and down.

54
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,480
You must have something to request from me, right?

55
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,150
You are pretty close.

56
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:25,310
Fourth Older Brother, come out with me for a while.

57
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:28,250
Kunlun Void is really your place.

58
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,980
You talk differently to me.

59
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:35,490
When I'm back, I will slaughter you in a round.

60
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,930
You are pulling this stunt again.

61
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:40,030
Don't underestimate me.

62
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,070
Let's go.

63
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,400
- Fourth Older Brother, let's go.
- Forget it.

64
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,600
I will set up a game and wait for you to come back.

65
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,780
If you lose again, you'll be unhappy and avoid me for half a month.

66
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,320
Fourth Older Brother, help me with a favor.

67
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,340
What's wrong? Weren't you serious just now?

68
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,010
You are now asking a favor from me?

69
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:07,930
It's a small matter.

70
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:12,640
If it involves the crown prince of the Heavenly Tribe, how can it be a small matter?

71
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,210
How did you know it's about him?

72
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:21,390
Other than him, I have never seen anyone who's able to make you act like a little girl.

73
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,560
Okay, you are the best.

74
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,630
It's him.

75
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:31,940
Fourth Older Brother, can you help me hide for a few hours?

76
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:35,250
I want to go to the Mortal Realm to see Ye Hua.

77
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,670
Are you going through all this trouble

78
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:41,730
because you're afraid your senior brothers will find out

79
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:45,240
and laugh at you for being so immersed in love?

80
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,830
Fourth Older Brother, looks like even you misunderstand things.

81
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:54,850
I'm not trying to hide because of my senior brothers.

82
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:58,780
I'm just worried about Teacher.

83
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:02,230
I'm worried Teacher will worry about his twin younger brother''s tribulation in the Mortal Realm,

84
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,910
so I want to take a look.

85
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:07,520
You also know how foul the air is in the Mortal Realm.

86
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,390
If Teacher goes, it will affect his recuperation.

87
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,380
If you think this way, you are overestimating me.

88
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,770
I'm so thin-skinned.

89
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:24,310
If a few hours is the time you require, I won't be able to sleep tonight.

90
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,560
At most, I will grant you half an hour.

91
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,870
Ye Hua went to the Mortal Realm just for a tribulation.

92
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:33,340
It's not a big deal and you want to follow him down there?

93
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,640
You are watching him too closely.

94
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,340
Then... it's agreed?

95
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,460
Half an hour at most.

96
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:46,150
Otherwise, don't blame me for personally going down to get you.

97
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,810
Fourth Older Brother, look.

98
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:56,340
It's snowing in Kunlun Void.

99
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:01,130
This is the first time you came together with Zhe Yan, right?

100
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,930
You two should go take in the view at the back of the mountain.

101
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:05,700
Kunlun Void's snow landscape is renowned in Four Seas.

102
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,360
Never mind the snow.

103
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,140
Even if it's falling fire, I'm too lazy to watch.

104
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,990
Half an hour and nothing more.

105
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:15,710
When I have defeated Zhe Yan, you must be back.

106
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:27,780
This is not right. If I were to calculate, the crown prince can't be more than ten years old now.

107
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,310
Why is she going down to the Mortal Realm?

108
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:34,410
Forget it. Let that Old Phoenix wait.

109
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,810
I'm going down to the Mortal Realm to take a look at the fun.

110
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:43,230
Before Luan Wuzi didn't have a 100-household estate.

111
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,710
- His family was so poor that they couldn't even prepare a complete set of funeral offerings.
- This mortal world

112
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:50,340
- is also snowing like in Kunlun Void.
- But he was able to propagate good morality and strictly follow the rules.

113
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,620
Famous among the different feudal lords of different states.

114
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,780
These feudal lords tried to be close to him,

115
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:58,590
a few citizens willingly submitted to him; hence, pacifying the Jin State.

116
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:04,110
He promulgated the laws, didn't engage in any malpractice, and prevented any disasters from happening.

117
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:08,770
Before Luan Wuzi didn't have a 100-household estate.

118
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:11,650
His family was so poor that they couldn't even prepare a complete set of funeral offerings.

119
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:16,630
But he was able to propagate good morality and strictly follow the rules.

120
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,960
Famous among the different feudal lords of different states.

121
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,470
These feudal lords tried to be close to him, a few citizens willingly submitted to him;

122
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,690
hence, pacifying the Jin State.

123
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,630
He promulgated the laws, didn't engage in malpractice,

124
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:30,100
and prevented any disasters from happening.

125
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:34,240
Stop. Zhaoge, stand up.

126
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,110
Continue to recite.

127
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,910
Yes.

128
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,770
When this reached Huanzi, he became too arrogant and conceited. Spending excessively.

129
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,370
Has insatiable greed.

130
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,990
Breaking the law and doing wild acts.

131
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,910
Lending with interest and amassing great wealth.

132
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:53,550
He should have suffered great disaster, but due to accumulated good karma by his father, Luan Wuzi, he was able to get a good ending.

133
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:58,130
They all said that Crown Prince Ye Hua's teachers were Spiritual Master Ci Hang and Lord of Yuanshi.

134
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:00,390
He was both knowledgeable in Daoist principles and immortal techniques.

135
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,120
A child genius that was never seen before in the Nine Heavens.

136
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,750
This knowledge in the Mortal Realm is considered too easy for him.

137
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,930
...and strictly follow the rules.

138
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,430
It's snowing!

139
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,490
Rice is expensive! Oil is also expensive!

140
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,840
The Liu Family has a disabled child!

141
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:29,220
Even if he knows so many words, without strength, what can you do?

142
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,630
- without strength, what can you do? 
- What are you doing?

143
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:39,660
They are too undisciplined. They even dared to bully Young Master in the courtyard of the study.

144
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,970
That's right. We have tolerated them for many days.

145
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:44,030
Let's teach them a lesson. Let's go.

146
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,880
No need.

147
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:54,000
Heavenly Monarch is so cruel to his grandson.

148
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,550
He made him lose an arm even while undergoing tribulation in the Mortal Realm.

149
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,620
Even good people have to suffer.

150
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,510
Young Master is such a good kid.

151
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:12,130
How could God let him lose an arm?

152
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,820
What happened?

153
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,900
Something happened?

154
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:43,350
This must be a dream.

155
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,690
Hey.

156
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:57,880
I'm not dreaming after all.

157
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,480
Do you know me?

158
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,250
I don't.

159
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,680
Who are you?

160
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,330
How did you enter my room?

161
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:10,070
Let me tell you. I'm...

162
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:14,110
I'm originally a little immortal from Green Hill who was able to peek into Heaven's plans.

163
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:18,520
I learned that after 10 years, we are fated to be husband and wife.

164
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:23,390
I'm here today to take a look at my future husband.

165
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:28,550
I'm... your future husband?

166
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,410
Why the face?

167
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:36,490
Do you dislike my appearance?

168
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:39,290
You are very pretty.

169
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:41,580
Do you really mean it?

170
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,220
Although I haven't seen a lot of girls,

171
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:48,070
those in drawings still aren't half as beautiful as you.

172
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,480
Do you believe what I just said?

173
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,620
That we are destined to be a married couple in the future?

174
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,490
Yes.

175
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:08,210
I have a pearl bracelet.

176
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:12,810
If I'm not by your side, it will keep you company. Okay?

177
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:17,340
I have a jade.

178
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,760
It's for you.

179
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:24,390
- This is for me?
- Yes.

180
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,290
Thank you.

181
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:28,460
I will wear it every day.

182
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:32,060
All right. I will wear this, too.

183
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:34,570
It's agreed between us then.

184
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:37,220
You cannot marry someone else.

185
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,550
When I have the time, I will visit you.

186
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,280
I will marry you when you have grown up.

187
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,420
What?

188
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,780
I'm here just to watch some fun.

189
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,780
I'm surprised, I'm surprised.

190
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:58,770
Your thoughts are scarily too meticulous that you didn't even spare a child.

191
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:03,690
I'm just afraid that he'll invite unnecessary romance while here in the mortal world.

192
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:06,460
They all said that Second Sister-in-Law is the most easily jealous in our Bai Family.

193
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,670
How come I feel that you're worse than her?

194
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,750
Fourth Older Brother!

195
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,530
Even if I tell you, you wouldn't understand.

196
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:17,530
In Heaven and Earth, you are the one who least understands women.

197
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:38,000
Young Master, you are awake.

198
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:49,350
Green Hill?

199
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:01,690
Young Master, what are you looking for?

200
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:05,280
I'm looking for a place called Green Hill.

201
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,780
Green Hill?

202
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,560
What a strange name.

203
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,650
I've accompanied you in your studies every day and have never heard of it.

204
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,500
Young Master, stop looking.

205
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,770
You can ask the teacher.

206
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:25,950
That's right. I can ask the teacher.

207
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:28,110
[Moral and virtue shapes people]

208
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:32,130
You haven't heard of this, either?

209
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:33,540
I haven't.

210
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,170
I've read tens of thousands of books.

211
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:39,730
I have never read about Green Hill.

212
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:06,460
My dear niece, what brings you here?

213
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,960
Aren't you afraid that your father will beat you?

214
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:15,360
My father doesn't care about me anymore.

215
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:22,680
Did Second Older Brother finally figure it out and isn't hindering you anymore?

216
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,350
He isn't.

217
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:31,400
My father knows that Emperor won't accept me no matter what,

218
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,870
so there's no point for him to stop me.

219
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,610
Foolish girl.

220
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:51,880
I initially thought that you'd be fine after crying it out.

221
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,510
Turns out you still can't forget him.

222
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:59,300
I can't forget him.

223
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,940
Even if he speaks rudely to me,

224
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,590
even if he bullies me,

225
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:07,310
I just can't forget him.

226
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,720
If you are asked to forget about His Highness the Crown Prince,

227
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,930
can you do it?

228
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:24,480
It's my fault for not putting myself in your shoes.

229
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,250
You still haven't answered me.

230
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,830
Can you forget him?

231
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,580
I can't.

232
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:42,520
Old Phoenix, why are you eavesdropping on us?

233
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:47,460
Young Highness, High God Mo Yuan and I have been standing here for quite some time.

234
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,090
You two should have evaded.

235
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:54,060
We were having a girl talk,

236
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,880
but you have eavesdropped on all of it.

237
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,040
You are so rude.

238
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,070
You are finally awake?

239
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:05,740
Fengjiu, why are you being so rude to my teacher?

240
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:08,510
Please forgive me, High God.

241
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:12,230
Earlier, when I saw you standing there,

242
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,750
I didn't realize it.

243
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:19,350
After all... I've seen you sleeping in Splendid Flame Cave for 70,000 years.

244
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:24,090
Hence, suddenly seeing you alive and— Oh, wrong!

245
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:28,040
Suddenly seeing you bursting with life and intimidating presence,

246
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,710
I wasn't able to immediately get used to it.

247
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:32,260
High God, please forgive me.

248
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,170
It's okay.

249
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,840
Since you're here, too, why don't you join us for drinks?

250
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,940
Mo Yuan once took some tens of thousand-year-old good brew from my place.

251
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,010
Today's the perfect day to drink them.

252
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:46,620
Sure! Drinking wine can drown my sorrows.

253
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,150
Problems would just get more worrisome.

254
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:54,750
Then, I will just worry about them tomorrow.

255
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:08,910
I still remember that when you asked me for this wine,

256
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:12,170
it was for Young Fifth's birthday present. Right?

257
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,730
Yes.

258
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:18,540
I also recall that. It's a pity that I didn't even get to drink it

259
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,930
before I was caught by Teacher's admirer, High Goddess Yao Guang.

260
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,620
I was imprisoned in the Water Prison.

261
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,890
My birthday was spent in the Water Prison.

262
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,930
- It was really unforgettable.
- Oh?

263
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,390
Did that really happen between him and Yao Guang?

264
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:33,240
Let's not discuss a person who has returned to the formless mass.

265
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,790
I said the wrong thing.

266
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,690
I will punish myself with this cup of wine.

267
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:46,710
Old Phoenix, tell me about the emperor's past.

268
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:52,130
Dong Hua?

269
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:56,440
He's even worse than Mo Yuan at getting close to women.

270
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,380
Why doesn't he get close to women, either?

271
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,250
Is he a man or not?

272
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:05,270
Young Jiu, you must get this straight.

273
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:09,470
That man in your heart used to be the ruler of Heaven and Earth.

274
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:12,170
He's an outstanding man.

275
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:19,050
In any case, I also respect you for choosing such a person from thousands of others.

276
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:22,040
You are not allowed to talk bad about him.

277
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:27,570
This little brat's alcohol tolerance is nothing compared to yours.

278
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,080
It's good to have bad alcohol tolerance.

279
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,790
You will get drunk faster.

280
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:36,720
But Zhe Yan, do you know why this Emperor Dong Hua doesn't get close to women?

281
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,340
It's because of Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses.

282
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:47,560
Yes, it's because of the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses.

283
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:14,310
When I came with Zhe Yan a few days ago, I could still go up the mountain freely.

284
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:19,340
With the dragon aura here now, I feel that it's hard to approach it.

285
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:26,070
So to say, High God Mo Yuan's spirit has returned to his body.

286
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:39,510
Brothers, why are you standing here?

287
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,030
It's nothing.

288
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:46,190
I only feel that Kunlun Void has restored its life again,

289
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:48,330
so I'm here to take a look.

290
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,650
High God Mo Yuan's spirit has returned to his body.

291
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:56,450
Even High God Zhe Yan, High God Bai Zhen of Green Hill, and the Great Lady are here.

292
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,420
I see.

293
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:04,620
Thank you for letting me know.

294
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,660
This man is strange.

295
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:17,000
After hearing that High God Mo Yuan is back, he doesn't look happy.

296
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,900
Could he be from another tribe?

297
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,810
Probably so.

298
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,740
Young Jiu.

299
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,730
Aunt, morning.

300
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:41,810
It's not morning anymore. Fourth Older Brother and the others have been waiting for you for a long time.

301
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:44,650
- They are waiting for me?
- That's right.

302
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:49,370
You should know that the Heavenly Tribe and Green Hill are preparing to hold the wedding between me and Ye Hua.

303
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:50,920
You are going to take over my post.

304
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:54,370
You should concentrate on more serious matters and go back to Green Hill soon.

305
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:59,100
Aunt, you want me to go back and take over your post?

306
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:03,340
In Green Hill, you're the only girl of your generation.

307
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,610
If you don't accept it, who would?

308
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:09,420
You want me to give up on Dong Hua, too.

309
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:12,760
I didn't say that.

310
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:17,680
If you marry into the Heavenly Tribe, you can't succeed the throne.

311
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:22,210
Because you are marrying into the Heavenly Palace, you won't be able to take care of the people in Green Hill.

312
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:26,660
But if I want to marry Emperor Dong Hua, I will marry into the Heavenly Palace, too.

313
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:29,800
I won't be able to take care of the people in Green Hill, either.

314
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,020
Aunt, you obviously knew about this.

315
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,850
Why do you still want me to take the throne?

316
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:38,600
Aunt, do you want me to remain forever in Green Hill?

317
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,760
Young Jiu,

318
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,000
just forget him.

319
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,820
But, Aunt, you told me last night that you can't forget Crown Prince Ye Hua, either,

320
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:54,170
because you like him.

321
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:59,170
What you can't do, why do you want me to handle it instead?

322
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:10,840
Young Jiu, listen to me.

323
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,660
You are not fated to be with Dong Hua.

324
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,010
Why must you force it?

325
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:23,620
I thought that you were on my side last night,

326
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:27,460
that even if everyone in our family wanted to lock me up,

327
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:30,250
you were the only one who could free me,

328
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:35,840
that you would let me try to make the emperor fall in love with me again.

329
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:43,310
I don't want to be the monarchess.

330
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:47,470
If I become the monarchess, I won't be able to go to Nine Heavens again!

331
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:49,200
Young Jiu!

332
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,430
Young Jiu!

333
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,670
Young Jiu!

334
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:01,960
It still doesn't work?

335
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:06,630
I merely told her to go back to Green Hill and take over the post of the monarchess,

336
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:08,960
and she started crying like this.

337
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:14,170
Between the both of you, one was enlightened too early and other too late.

338
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:15,790
Forget about this. Leave this to me.

339
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:18,110
I will escort her home safely.

340
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:22,570
Tell Second Older Brother not to pressure her too much.

341
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:25,840
Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.

342
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,510
You are her aunt, and you dote on her.

343
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:32,490
I'm her fourth uncle who equally dotes on her.

344
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:36,520
Zhe Yan is worried about Mo Yuan's health and needs to remain in Kunlun Void for a few more days.

345
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,030
I will leave first.

346
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,910
All right.

347
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,630
Do you want to see Ah Yin?

348
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:57,820
I do.

349
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:02,000
Me, too.

350
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:08,280
Perhaps, this is the last chance for me to see her.

351
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,530
Isn't His Highness the Crown Prince marrying her soon?

352
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:14,600
By then, the wedding invitation will be delivered to the Grand Purple Palace.

353
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,360
You will be able to see them.

354
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,510
I can't wait that long.

355
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,430
You can't wait that long?

356
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,610
Why not?

357
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:36,330
Isn't it soon?

358
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:56,810
What are you looking at?

359
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,640
Little girl, you are ugly when you cry.

360
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,750
It's a rare sight in Kunlun Void.

361
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,810
You said that I look ugly when I cry?

362
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:14,560
Then, I will stay here and cry till you can't take it anymore.

363
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,890
Cry then.

364
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,960
You are only making it hard for yourself.

365
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,310
It doesn't concern me.

366
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:38,860
Does this cave look nice?

367
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,550
To me, it's very nice.

368
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,210
Such an uninteresting person.

369
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:51,540
That's right.

370
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,560
Uninteresting.

371
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:57,040
I said that you are an uninteresting person.

372
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,460
I know.

373
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:02,210
I was talking about myself, too.

374
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:07,900
Standing in front of the cave and looking back past tens of thousands of years ago,

375
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:14,280
I just realized that my life is endless and uninteresting.

376
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:33,710
- Good boy.
- Winged Monarch.

377
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:40,280
Second Older Brother, did you meet His Highness the Crown Prince?

378
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,110
No.

379
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,610
You didn't?

380
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:47,940
Did you meet Heavenly Monarch or Emperor Dong Hua then?

381
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,530
Why not?

382
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:57,250
Aren't you afraid that Father will break out from Donghuang Bell and use Red Lotus Fire to destroy the Four Seas?

383
00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:00,180
And that's why you went to Heavenly Tribe to discuss this?

384
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,850
The Winged Realm is in great chaos now.

385
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:07,600
Many sub-tribe chieftains are currently unable to suppress the mobs.

386
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,560
Second Older Brother, we can't delay any further.

387
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,800
If Father really breaks out from the Donghuang Bell,

388
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,640
many people will follow him.

389
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,440
By then, when we go to the Heavenly Tribe to plead, it will be too late.

390
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,490
I know.

391
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:23,240
Second Older Brother!

392
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,660
Say something. Let me know what's on your mind.

393
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:29,300
Or else, I'll die from anxiety.

394
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,480
Yan Zhi, do you know?

395
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,310
Ah Yin and the Crown Prince will marry soon.

396
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:40,950
They were previously engaged.

397
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:46,840
This is a marital alliance between the Heavenly Tribe and Green Hill.

398
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:51,190
This is the most prestigious marriage in Four Seas.

399
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:04,260
In the past, I thought that, as a prince of the Winged Tribe,

400
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:07,580
I would give my most beloved woman the best wedding.

401
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:11,850
But compared to Ye Hua,

402
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:14,500
that's such a joke.

403
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,280
Second Older Brother,

404
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:21,360
I know you only have High Goddess Bai Qian in your heart.

405
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,410
But...

406
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:30,360
High God Mo Yuan's spirit is back to his body now,

407
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:35,260
and Ah Yin is in Kunlun Void.

408
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,990
She must be extremely happy.

409
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:41,030
High God Mo Yuan's spirit is back to his body?!

410
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:46,680
That's good. Second Older Brother, let's go and tell High God Mo Yuan.

411
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:51,230
That our lives are the key to helping Father increase his power.

412
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:57,780
Tell Kunlun Void that because Eldest Brother died, Father is already stronger,

413
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:00,460
so he can't remain sealed.

414
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,080
We can't tell them.

415
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,710
Why?

416
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:07,540
Yan Zhi, have you ever thought of this?

417
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:11,510
If Father breaks out from Donghuang Bell, who will seal him?

418
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,810
Of course, it's High God Mo Yuan.

419
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:18,120
Donghuang Bell was created by him.

420
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,570
70,000 years ago, he succeeded once in sealing Father.

421
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,160
Naturally, it will be him again.

422
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,200
Think carefully again.

423
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,370
If Ah Yin finds out that Mo Yuan wants to seal him,

424
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:33,060
would she let her Teacher disperse his soul again?

425
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:39,840
By then, she will definitely go all out to protect her teacher.

426
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:44,540
Seeing that she's going to marry soon,

427
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:50,350
I don't want anything to happen to her at this time.

428
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,130
But...

429
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:58,030
As the Winged Monarch for 70,000 years,

430
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:03,120
I never did any good deed to bring blessings to my citizens and the Winged Realm.

431
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:10,130
I was wandering around the Mortal World looking for the whereabouts of Ah Yin.

432
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:13,710
As of today,

433
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:17,050
if I still don't do anything,

434
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:20,260
I will be incompetent trash.

435
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,210
Second Older Brother, you...

436
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,780
What are you talking about?

437
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,890
Second Older Brother, what are you doing?

438
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:59,060
Get up now.

439
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:08,710
Yan Zhi,

440
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:13,060
I'm entrusting my son to you.

441
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:16,550
In the Grand Purple Palace,

442
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:19,560
you will be the only one left with royal blood.

443
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:26,350
I'm even entrusting the Winged Realm to you today.

444
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:28,850
Second Older Brother, what are you going to do?

445
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,150
- Fire Kirin.
- Mighty Monarch.

446
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,770
Lock up the princess in Land of Extreme Coldness.

447
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:59,180
Before the issue of Donghuang Bell is concluded, don't let her out.

448
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,610
No, I can't leave you.

449
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:03,160
Listen to me!

450
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,580
I can't.

451
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:08,880
Even you don't want to acknowledge me as your monarch?

452
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,540
It's not that.

453
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,830
You grew up with me.

454
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:22,720
Other than my mother, you are my closest family.

455
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:28,890
I can only hand over Yan Zhi and the child to you so that I can be at ease.

456
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:30,800
Do you understand?

457
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:38,920
Mighty Monarch, can I find you again after I have escorted the princess there?

458
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,090
You can't.

459
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:49,070
When I'm dead, I want you to help Yan Zhi become the new Winged Monarchess.

460
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:53,050
You are the most auspicious deity beast in the Winged Realm.

461
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:58,350
With you by Yan Zhi's side, no one will dare to hurt Yan Zhi.

462
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:05,690
Without Father, without me, they will naturally acknowledge Yan Zhi as the Winged Monarchess.

463
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:10,840
Hurry and take the princess away!

464
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,400
- Yes!
- Yes!

465
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:30,920
- Mighty Monarch...
- Leave!

466
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:55,650
Seven days.

467
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:59,390
Give me seven days.

468
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:02,260
I will definitely succeed.

469
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,560
For the past few days, there has been great waves in Ruoshui.

470
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,610
I wonder what the reason is.

471
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:22,770
It doesn't seem that simple.

472
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:25,630
We must be careful and take precautions.

473
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,210
A guest is here to pay homage again.

474
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,510
Brew tea.

475
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:54,550
Zhe Yan, stop fooling around. Let me sleep.

476
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:57,550
I didn't have a good rest yesterday.

477
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:01,920
I'm here to find you regarding an important matter.

478
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:07,600
What important matter would you have for coming to Kunlun Void?

479
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,970
High God Mo Yuan has already set the date for his seclusion.

480
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:16,330
It's in seven days.

481
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:18,670
I'm going to refine some medicinal pills for him

482
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:22,790
to take into seclusion at the cave to help him with his recovery.

483
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:26,210
During this period, I want you to assist me.

484
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:28,490
Teacher is going into seclusion?

485
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:31,750
He has been back for eleven days. He should go into seclusion.

486
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:35,620
After all, the cultivation of Ye Hua was only enough to wake him up.

487
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:40,230
He's still very weak, and needs to rest and recuperate.

488
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:48,600
For the past days, you were either at the pharmacy or the Pellet-Cultivating Furnace.

489
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:53,740
You didn't even have time to drink some tea and moisten your throat.

490
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:56,830
If you have nothing to do today, go visit your teacher.

491
00:36:56,830 --> 00:37:01,110
I fear when he goes into seclusion, you won't be able to see him for quite a while.

492
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,720
How long will Teacher be in seclusion?

493
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,920
It could be 10 days, or half a month, or even 10 years.

494
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,430
I'll go see Teacher right now.

495
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:17,990
Oh! Teacher loves peach blossoms.

496
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:22,380
I'm going to pick some to replace the ones in Teacher's room.

497
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:51,330
I love hearing you play the zither.

498
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:54,550
It always soothes me.

499
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:59,640
Can I become a high immortal faster if I listen to you play more often?

500
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:16,520
Teacher, I'm going to help Zhe Yan refine your medical pills tomorrow.

501
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,440
I won't be able to greet you for many days.

502
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,440
I'm here especially to replace your peach blossoms.

503
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,780
Peach blossoms wither after just one day.

504
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:30,910
I've instructed Sixteenth Senior to come and change them every day from now on.

505
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:37,030
You came just for that tonight?

506
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:43,360
Teacher, ever since you came back to Kunlun Void,

507
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:47,810
we have been very busy, so I haven't had time to have a proper chat with you.

508
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:52,490
Moreover, Zhe Yan told me that you are going into seclusion soon.

509
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:56,770
It could take ten days, half a month, or even several years,

510
00:38:56,770 --> 00:39:00,440
so I wanted to come see you.

511
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:09,570
Am I bothering you?

512
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:11,530
No.

513
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:17,340
I remember when I first came to Kunlun Void, I was very childish.

514
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:20,020
I only knew that you played the zither very well,

515
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:22,880
so I bugged you to play musical pieces every day.

516
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,070
Do you remember?

517
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,470
I remember.

518
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:33,870
Speaking of which, I've never heard Ye Hua play for me.

519
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:42,850
Does Ye Hua... treat you well?

520
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:48,600
His way of treating me well is different from the way you treat me well.

521
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,540
In any case, he's very sincere.

522
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,610
That's good to hear.

523
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,660
It's snowing.

524
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:51,520
An unexpected mishap. An unexpected mishap.

525
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,520
What are you thinking about?

526
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,620
You are so focused.

527
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:11,690
I'm thinking about what Teacher used to say.

528
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:15,390
That the disciples from Kunlun Void love to brew peach blossom honey.

529
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:16,950
That's only to humor the kids.

530
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:18,530
It's too sweet.

531
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:21,120
Are you interested?

532
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,850
Is it sweet?

533
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:25,720
Then, please pack some for me.

534
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,970
Zhen Zhen has loved sweets ever since he was little.

535
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:33,550
When he got sick, he would only drink his medicine if it was sweet.

536
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,830
Zhen Zhen?

537
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:38,910
When did you get married?

538
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:43,430
He's not my child. I'm talking about High God Bai Zhen.

539
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:48,770
You are right. Compared to you, High God Bai Zhen is still a kid.

540
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:51,230
I'll pack some extra for you.

541
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,580
Are you cold?

542
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,650
I'll close the windows.

543
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:21,660
No need.

544
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:27,790
It's getting late.

545
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:30,450
You should go back to rest.

546
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:32,600
It's my fault.

547
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,240
I forgot you still have to recuperate.

548
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,610
I'll be leaving now.

549
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:22,990
”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

550
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:25,010
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

551
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:27,640
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

552
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:32,910
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

553
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:42,160
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

554
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:46,310
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

555
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:51,580
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

556
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:58,970
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

557
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:03,990
♫ All are just illusions ♫

558
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:10,680
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

559
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:15,840
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

560
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:20,360
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

561
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:26,450
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

562
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:32,010
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

563
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:37,050
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

564
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:39,850
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

565
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:48,870
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from
my previous life ♫

566
00:44:55,860 --> 00:45:01,090
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

567
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:06,660
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

568
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:10,910
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

569
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:17,230
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

570
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:22,490
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

571
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:27,770
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

572
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:30,620
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

573
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:39,530
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

574
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:52,080
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
