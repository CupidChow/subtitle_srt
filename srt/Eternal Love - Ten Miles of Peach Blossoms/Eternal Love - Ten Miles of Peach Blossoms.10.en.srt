”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

2
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,580
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,110
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:24,690
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,960
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,490
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:35,230
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,810
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:42,360
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,880
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,460
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:53,090
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:56,450
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:00,080
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,570
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,070
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,590
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,000
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,060
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,830
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:21,230
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:24,840
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,080
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,910
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:34,550
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:38,890
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,130
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:46,100
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

[Eternal Love]

30
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,070
[Episode 10]

31
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,030
In my opinion, Young Fifth didn't give any importance to this marriage alliance, either.

32
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,190
Why not just break off it?

33
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,230
- How about it?
- Yes.

34
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,920
No.

35
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,070
This engagement can't be broken off.

36
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,600
This is the agreement between us, the Heavenly Tribe, and Fox Tribes.

37
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:39,590
How can we allow such an insignificant Bashe snake to destroy such a nice marriage?

38
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,500
That's right.

39
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,730
What you said, makes sense, too.

40
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,920
In my opinion,

41
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,770
His Second Highness is not interested in our Young Fifth, either.

42
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:02,640
Brother Bai, we shouldn't be so insistent on breaking up this pair of lovers. Right?

43
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,920
That's right.

44
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,340
Fox Emperor,

45
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,480
what exactly do you have in mind?

46
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,490
You're fine with both breaking off the engagement and not breaking off it.

47
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:17,340
I think that both your arguments sound logical.

48
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,250
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

49
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,530
Greetings, Heavenly Monarch.

50
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,940
Rise.

51
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,400
Yes.

52
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:47,100
High Gods, this is my grandson, Ye Hua.

53
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:58,050
My greetings to the High Gods.

54
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,530
What is your relationship to Mo Yuan?

55
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,650
There isn't any.

56
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:12,760
Heavenly Monarch, don't you think that your grandson is identical to the deceased High God Mo Yuan?

57
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,890
I was puzzled, too.

58
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:18,430
I even had the thought that

59
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:22,350
although High God Mo Yuan's spirit had shattered 70,000 years ago,

60
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,370
his soul could have been retained.

61
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:29,430
And after 20,000 years of recuperation, he borrowed Ye Hua's body to be reborn.

62
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,180
Borrowed His Highness' body?

63
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,580
It can't be.

64
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,920
Even if Mo Yuan's soul still remains,

65
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,820
he would never reincarnate it anywhere else.

66
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:43,580
He would definitely return to Kunlun Void.

67
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,390
This was my initial inference, too.

68
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,780
I subsequently felt relieved later on.

69
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,070
When High God Mo Yuan was 250,000 years old, he transcended into a High Immortal.

70
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:57,360
My grandson already transcended into a High Immortal when he was 20,000 years old.

71
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,040
This child...

72
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:07,970
wants to prove that he's not Mo Yuan.

73
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,230
Is that so?

74
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:17,340
He transcended into a High Immortal when he was 20,000 years old?

75
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,570
The younger generation will surpass the older generation.

76
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,220
Definitely so.

77
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,330
I wonder if Your Highness has a Royal Consort.

78
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:35,760
I'm not married.

79
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,180
Not bad. Not bad.

80
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,310
- Second Highness.
- Second Highness.

81
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:53,490
Are there a lot of visitors in the palace today?

82
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:58,150
Other than Emperor Dong Hua who doesn't like lively events, everyone else is here.

83
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,010
- You may leave.
- Yes.

84
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,040
Are you afraid?

85
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:12,240
I'm not afraid.

86
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,730
All the immortals are in the palace right now.

87
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:17,420
If we use this opportunity to plead to my Father Monarch,

88
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,940
perhaps, we still might have a chance.

89
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:23,190
If he wants to take your life,

90
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,890
I will die with you.

91
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,380
Second Highness.

92
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,320
I gave the Tutelary of Ruoshui a token.

93
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,060
I said that if Qing Cang makes any movements these days,

94
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,540
I would personally go and check.

95
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,860
But we need to report to the Heavenly Monarch first.

96
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,500
Wait.

97
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,350
Dear High Gods.

98
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,890
Stop. Leave.

99
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,020
Yes.

100
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,120
He's really smart to choose such a festive event to plead for mercy.

101
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,910
I already told you that this is not a good idea.

102
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:48,950
You said that we'd be able to break off this engagement by us echoing one another.

103
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:51,900
Now, we're in the presence of so many gods.

104
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,930
This will only embarrass Young Fifth even more.

105
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:58,650
Don't blame me for this.

106
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:02,890
How would I know that His Second Highness had such a strong character?

107
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,090
Sang Ji, how dare you!

108
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,690
Without my consent, you trespassed into Demon Tower.

109
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,690
I beg you, Father Monarch. Please agree to my request.

110
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,150
Shao Xin doesn't know any magic.

111
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,180
If I didn't save her,

112
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:43,180
I fear that she would have died in Demon Tower after today.

113
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:47,800
You care so much about her wellbeing.

114
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,880
No matter the cost, are you even willing to die with her?

115
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,010
Yes.

116
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm willing to die with Shao Xin.

117
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,240
Fine.

118
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:23,180
I will fulfill your wish.

119
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,840
Today, in front of these two gods,

120
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:33,660
you and that little Bashe snake will die for your sins.

121
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:48,230
I will abide.

122
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:11,740
Shao Xin, although we have been together for only three months,

123
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:16,330
it was better than the tens of thousands of years I have lived.

124
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:23,790
Today, you will go first and I will follow later.

125
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,020
Second Highness,

126
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:38,010
I am willing to die with you.

127
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,200
Fox Emperor.

128
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,830
Look at how strong their love is.

129
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:10,130
They didn't even commit any evil sins which can't be forgiven.

130
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:15,100
Why don't you decide to break off the engagement now and let this matter rest?

131
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:21,170
Since High God Zhe Yan has pleaded on behalf of His Second Highness—

132
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:23,010
No.

133
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,860
It's the fault of my tribe.

134
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,890
We need to give the Fox Tribe an explanation.

135
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,270
Father Monarch, could you listen to what I have to say?

136
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,110
What do you want to say?

137
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:51,590
I think the engagement of Second Older Brother and High Immortal Bai Qian can just break off here.

138
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,340
How presumptuous!

139
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:58,570
Is the engagement between the Heavenly Tribe and Fox Tribe for you to decide?

140
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:01,170
Father Monarch, please let me finish talking.

141
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,030
Speak.

142
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:07,890
If you say anything presumptuous again, I will punish you.

143
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:10,950
Thank you, Father Monarch, for letting me finish what I have to say.

144
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:14,210
And thank you, Fox Emperor, for letting me talk boldly.

145
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:19,580
Second Older Brother and High Immortal Bai Qians' engagement is also the engagement between Heavenly Tribe and Fox Tribe.

146
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,400
It's a major event and a necessary event.

147
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,530
It's also Heavenly Tribe and Fox Tribes' goodwill.

148
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:28,500
Since Second Older Brother can't marry High Immortal Bai Qian,

149
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:33,180
why don't we change to another distinguished person from Heavenly Tribe to marry High Immortal Bai Qian?

150
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,270
First, this is still an engagement between the Heavenly Tribe and Fox Tribe.

151
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:40,070
Second, it will also preserve the reputation of both tribes.

152
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,790
How can we simply change the candidate for the engagement at a whim?

153
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,010
Who do you think our Young Fifth is?

154
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,790
Fox Emperor, please don't misunderstand.

155
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,010
I wouldn't dare to look down on the Fox Tribe.

156
00:12:55,010 --> 00:13:01,830
Hence, the distinguished person from the Heavenly Tribe whom I'm referring to, is none other than the Heavenly Grandson Ye Hua.

157
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:06,870
- Ye Hua?
- That's right.

158
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:12,380
It's the Crown Prince of Heavenly Tribe and the future Heavenly Monarch, His Highness Ye Hua.

159
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:16,980
This idea sounds interesting.

160
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:20,260
High God, you are indeed an understanding person.

161
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:23,170
My Second Older Brother and High Immortal Bai Qian have never met.

162
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,880
Nor are they in love.

163
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,440
Now that he has someone whom he loves,

164
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,830
he's not right for High Immortal Bai Qian.

165
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:37,220
If my Second Older Brother were to continue with this engagement, we will have wronged Green Hill and the Fox Tribe.

166
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,360
That's right. They will definitely be wronged.

167
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:45,060
But if we change to Ye Hua, Heavenly Tribe will look even more sincere.

168
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,020
He's the future Heavenly Monarch.

169
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:50,390
If High Immortal Bai Qian marries him, she will be the future Heavenly Monarchess.

170
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,410
She will be the most distinguished woman in Heavenly Palace.

171
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:56,020
In this way, everyone will be happy.

172
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,790
Not bad. Not bad.

173
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,690
Everyone will definitely be happy.

174
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:04,990
I also think that Young Fifth and he are a good match.

175
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,600
Seriously?

176
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,100
I watched Young Fifth grow up.

177
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,040
How could I choose the wrong husband for her?

178
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,870
She has a strong temper.

179
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:16,070
When I arranged this engagement for her last time, she flatly refused.

180
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,360
It wasn't easy to break off this engagement today.

181
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:24,690
If you let her accept another unknown engagement, won't it bring more troubles?

182
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:28,240
If she's still unhappy by then, we will just break it off again.

183
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,570
Fox Emperor and I think this is a good idea, too.

184
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:37,270
Heavenly Monarch, what do you think?

185
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:43,230
Ye Hua, come forward and listen to the decree.

186
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,620
Heavenly Monarch.

187
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:57,500
Today, I order you to accept this engagement.

188
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,880
Once Fox Emperor has decided on the wedding date,

189
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:06,900
marry Empress Bai Qian of the Eastern Wilderness of Green Hill on behalf of our Heavenly Tribe as your main consort.

190
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:11,980
Once you succeed me, Bai Qian will become the Heavenly Monarchess.

191
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,470
I will abide.

192
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,370
Sang Ji.

193
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,500
I'm here.

194
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:33,760
You are exiled to the North and demoted as the Water Monarch of the North Sea.

195
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,260
I will abide.

196
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:45,980
Rotten rascal, we went easy on him.

197
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,320
He destroyed his future because of a woman.

198
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,680
Why bother?

199
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:02,870
I still feel a bit guilty.

200
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:05,870
It feels as if my breath can't go up or down.

201
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:11,520
Third Uncle, if you feel guilty, why don't you marry Bai Qian instead?

202
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,130
It can be considered a good predestined marriage, too.

203
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:17,170
She's not an ordinary woman.

204
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:20,440
She's the daughter of the Fox Emperor, the Empress of the Eastern Wilderness Green Hill.

205
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,440
If she transcends into a high goddess in the future,

206
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,260
she'll become the only High Goddess that no one would dare to provoke.

207
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,870
Earlier at the palace, if I had suggested to marry her,

208
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:31,640
Fox Emperor Bai Zhi and High God Zhe Yan wouldn't approve of me.

209
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,900
Third Uncle, there's no need to explain further.

210
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:38,010
Since it has come to this, I will marry her then.

211
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,590
[Pure Wutong Palace]

212
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:46,010
I feel so guilty. So guilty.

213
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:03,320
Why did you accept the decree?

214
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,410
Why shouldn't I accept it?

215
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:12,270
Ye Hua, I know you are fully aware,

216
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,630
fully aware of how I feel about you.

217
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:22,810
Since you are aware, why did you do this?

218
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:29,040
What do you think I should be fully aware of?

219
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,030
You should be fully aware that...

220
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,460
I like you.

221
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:57,660
Su Jin, I have always regarded you as my aunt.

222
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,820
I respect you like how I respect my mother.

223
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,860
You...

224
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:10,120
Are you complaining that I'm older than you by 20,000 years?

225
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,260
But that main consort that you are marrying,

226
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:20,990
the High Immortal Bai Qian of Green Hill,

227
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:24,290
is older than you by 90,000 years.

228
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,920
Ye Hua, I shouldn't have said that.

229
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:35,900
I know that you had no other choice.

230
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,710
It's also to pacify Green Hill.

231
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:41,020
That's not true.

232
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,300
I will need a main consort sooner or later. Anyone will be the same.

233
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:51,080
If you have the ability, be like Bai Qian, and make it so that I have no choice but to marry you.

234
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,130
Su Jin.

235
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,040
It's useless for you to kneel to me, too.

236
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:32,100
In this Heavenly Palace,

237
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:37,110
only the Heavenly Monarch has the right to arrange Ye Hua's marriage.

238
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:42,120
I will go and beg the Heavenly Monarch then.

239
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:49,070
Su Jin...

240
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:55,240
I have something to tell you.

241
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,210
Your Highness.

242
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:03,710
I personally raised you up.

243
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:06,700
I know how you feel for Ye Hua.

244
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,490
I also know that if you marry Ye Hua,

245
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:15,060
you will surely take care of him with undivided attention.

246
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:19,650
But this is only my opinion.

247
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:26,160
Heavenly Monarch and Ye Hua's father have high hopes for him.

248
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:34,000
The woman who marries Ye Hua needs to be from a distinguished tribe for the Heavenly Tribe.

249
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,250
Do you understand?

250
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,760
Your Highness,

251
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,750
are you saying that my title of the princess is just in name only?

252
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:53,450
I don't have a tribe or family or even parents.

253
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,980
I don't have the right to marry the future Heavenly Monarch.

254
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,890
Isn't that so?

255
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,620
That's right.

256
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:09,110
I was also from a distinguished tribe.

257
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:14,190
It's just that in that great battle, they were all... for the Heavenly Tribe.

258
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,120
For the Heavenly Tribe, they...

259
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,380
That's right.

260
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:24,180
Your entire tribe did sacrifice themselves to the Heavenly Tribe.

261
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:27,130
Your entire tribe did sacrifice themselves to the Heavenly Tribe.

262
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:33,230
That's why you were conferred as a princess and raised by me.

263
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,870
If Ye Hua was interested in you,

264
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:42,130
perhaps, you may still have the opportunity.

265
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,790
But he's not interested in you.

266
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:49,180
Why do you need to be obsessed with this?

267
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:02,540
Go and find someone who will treat you well.

268
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:33,100
Oh, my. You shook me so badly.

269
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,140
That Golden Lion from earlier is much stronger than you.

270
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,680
- Golden Lion?
- Yes.

271
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:41,070
- Was it that Golden Lion from the mountain and forest of Winged Realm?
- Yes.

272
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,780
He's very formidable.

273
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:46,990
I fear that only a High Immortal with great magical power can subdue him.

274
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,640
High Immortal again. High Immortal again.

275
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,890
Can you not mention High Immortals to me again?

276
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:52,950
I don't even know when I can transcend.

277
00:22:54,460 --> 00:23:00,500
By the way, I wonder why you summoned me again.

278
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:06,510
The Emperor said that you'll use your magic to shake the bell he gave you whenever there is any abnormal happening here.

279
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,070
Do you still remember?

280
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:10,700
I wouldn't dare to forget.

281
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,880
The Emperor has changed his mind now.

282
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,220
He said it is more appropriate for you to use this flute.

283
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,100
This...

284
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,050
Don't you believe me?

285
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:22,980
I wouldn't dare.

286
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,520
You came with the Emperor.

287
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,830
I personally witnessed that.

288
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:31,430
It's just that this small brass bell...

289
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:33,310
Just give it to me.

290
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:36,680
Okay, fine. Keep it safe.

291
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,160
I'm taking my leave.

292
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:47,530
Oh no, I need to rush over to celebrate Aunt's birthday with her now.

293
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,030
Your Highness, spare my life!

294
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,670
I beg Your Highness to spare my life!

295
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:04,090
Your Highness!

296
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:07,950
Spare your life?

297
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:12,550
Do you know that I wanted to take your life?

298
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:20,220
Only because your face looks rather similar to mine,

299
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:23,330
I chose you from among those in the palace

300
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:27,090
and specially sent you to His Mighty Monarch to serve him.

301
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:32,150
Yet you dare to secretly throw away the contraceptives soup and be pregnant with His Mighty Monarch's child?

302
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,350
You are just a palace maid.

303
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:40,360
You even dared to attempt to give birth to a prince?!

304
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,060
Your Highness, it wasn't me. It was His Mighty Monarch.

305
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,130
His Mighty Monarch wanted a child very much.

306
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:49,050
I had been sleeping with him for three months and there weren't any signs from my belly.

307
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:53,290
He found a shaman to diagnose me and found out that I had been taking the contraceptive soup.

308
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:55,730
Yes, it was His Mighty Monarch. His Mighty Monarch didn't want me to—

309
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:57,260
Shut up!

310
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,410
Your Highness, I went against your intention.

311
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:02,170
Please spare my life, Your Highness.

312
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,070
Spare your life?

313
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:13,310
If you weren't pregnant, perhaps I might spare your life.

314
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:17,160
But now that a slut like you is pregnant,

315
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,590
how do you expect me to spare your life?

316
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:27,800
Don't tell me you want the people to mock His Mighty Monarch?

317
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,980
Your Highness.

318
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,750
Take her away. Settle this without any trace tonight.

319
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,480
- Yes.
- Yes.

320
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,950
Xuan Nü, you deserve a horrible death!

321
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:42,780
I was extremely loyal to you and this is how you treat me?!

322
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,280
You even called me a slut?

323
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,430
It's you who can't even be pregnant!

324
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:50,390
You are jealous. Jealous that I'm pregnant after only being with His Mighty Monarch for three months!

325
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:52,390
You deserve it. It's retribution!

326
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:54,770
It's retribution for betraying Heavenly Tribe and Green Hill!

327
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:57,920
You will forever be infertile!

328
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:13,200
I will let you know now what it's like to die a horrible death!

329
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:16,870
Throw her into the Land of Extreme Coldness

330
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,760
- and feed her to the snow wolves.
- Yes.

331
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,010
Xuan Nü, you deserve a horrible death!

332
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:23,760
You deserve a horrible death!

333
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,390
Aunt!

334
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:43,730
Aunt.

335
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:46,990
- Little Fox, you're back.
- Yes.

336
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,290
I specially came back to celebrate Aunt's birthday.

337
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:55,900
I wish for Aunt to continue being the most beautiful person in the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses.

338
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,250
Aunt, are you happy upon hearing this?

339
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,990
Yes.

340
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:03,810
Aunt, you are still the same. Disrespectful as an elder.

341
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:15,840
Dare to say that I'm old? I will let you be a little fox for a while.

342
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:23,450
This is a nice item,

343
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:26,230
although I don't know where you stole it from.

344
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:43,840
Aunt, where are you going?

345
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:36,370
The past Kunlun Void was encircled by divine mist.

346
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:38,720
It was worshiped by the gods.

347
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,820
How did it fall into this state now?

348
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,510
Wow.

349
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:28,040
So, this is the legendary Kunlun Void?

350
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:38,750
From today, you two will be disciples of God of War, Mo Yuan, of Kunlun Void.

351
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:41,900
You will be the sixteenth disciple, Divine Monarch Zi Lan.

352
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,140
Thank you, Teacher!

353
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:46,180
You will be the seventeenth disciple, Divine Monarch Si Yin.

354
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:49,540
Thank you, Teacher!

355

♫ We once missed out in regret ♫

356
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,680
♫ Peach blossoms drift down ♫

357
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,790
♫ The light fragrant hiding the bitter anguish ♫

358
00:30:56,790 --> 00:31:00,840
Teacher, this is my heavenly tribulation! Teacher!

359
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,050
♫ The moon paints ten miles of night with light ♫

360
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:12,880
♫ It brings up the loneliness in my eyes ♫

361
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,870
♫ My unwillingness to leave you has been drowned by vicissitudes of life ♫

362
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:18,640
Ninth Senior Brother? Ninth Senior Brother!

363

♫ Three thousand years have flown by ♫

00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,310
Teacher.

367

♫ I thought I could let go  ♫

370
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:52,350
♫ But after I awake from my dream, I remember you and my tears flow ♫

371
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:57,670
Yesterday, I passed by Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms and got you three jugs of peach blossoms wine from Zhe Yan.

372
00:31:57,670 --> 00:32:01,260
Teacher, why did you get me some wine?

373
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,760
Isn't it your birthday tomorrow?

374
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,990
Aunt came here late in the night just to drink secretly?

375
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:25,030
Oh, no!

376
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:35,860
Little brat, you followed me all the way here.

377
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:39,950
Did you appreciate the scenery of the most sacred place of the Heavenly Tribe?

378
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,100
I'm going to go far away soon.

379
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:58,620
There is a spell recorded in this book.

380
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:03,560
As of today, I'm the only one who knows this spell.

381
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:08,140
If I die and this spell is no longer passed down,

382
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:11,470
the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses will be in great trouble.

383
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:20,460
Did Emperor Dong Hua give you this brass bell?

384
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:23,500
I knew when I saw it earlier.

385
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,570
As for how you got this brass bell...

386
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:30,990
If I'm fated to return, I will interrogate you.

387
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:35,150
What? Why did she say that?

388
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:37,810
Aunt, where are you going?

389
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:45,080
You definitely want to know where I'm going.

390
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:52,840
You definitely also know that what I don't want to talk about, no one can make me do it.

391
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,470
Sleep here for three days.

392
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:03,590
After three days, the divine shield I placed to protect you will shatter.

393
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:08,080
It will shake the bell and help you call the Emperor here.

394
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,270
Go to sleep.

395
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:31,900
It's indeed the time the seal is going to break.

396
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,240
Little immortal, you should protect yourself.

397
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,410
It has been 70,000 years.

398
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:13,020
Mo Yuan's shattered spirit was only able to trap me for 70,000 years.

399
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:17,720
Qing Cang, do you think you can be free after being locked up for 70,000 years?

400
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:22,720
Although my teacher is not here, he has transferred his seal spell to me.

401
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:28,100
Even if I pay with my life, I will lock you up for another 70,000 years.

402
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:31,210
You are Mo Yuan's disciple?

403
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,410
Who are you exactly?

404
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:41,040
I'm Bai Qian, the Empress of Green Hill, and also the previous Si Yin!

405
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:06,540
Red Lotus Fire?

406
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,770
[Early Dawn Palace]

407
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,610
You want to seal me?

408
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:29,870
That's only possible if Mo Yuan came back to life!

409
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:45,740
I want you to lose your magic and beauty

410
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:50,440
and spend the rest of your life suffering from illness and die of old age as a mortal!

411
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:56,060
And to never know who you are.

412
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:40,330
There were signs of Qing Cang waking up yesterday.

413
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:43,640
Why is it so quiet today?

414
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:59,740
Greetings, Emperor.

415
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:02,090
What happened?

416
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:07,340
Emperor, at sunrise today, this Donghuang bell really vibrated.

417
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:09,940
But when I came to explore,

418
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:13,400
I was sent back by an extremely beautiful lady.

419
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,220
An extremely beautiful lady?

420
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,960
That's right.

421
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,830
Was it the young lady who came with me yesterday?

422
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,570
No, it's not her.

423
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:23,240
It's not?

424
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,070
Who could it be?

425
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,010
That's right.

426
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:37,340
The young lady, who came with you yesterday, had exchanged the bell with this flute.

427
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:39,050
Is that so?

428
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:44,390
This Donghuang bell has gone into deep sleep again.

429
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:46,790
Something major probably wouldn't happen.

430
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:48,500
Give the flute to me.

431
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,300
Yes.

432
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:55,660
I'm taking my leave.

433
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:49,630
Who lost this fan?

434
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,280
Forget it. I will keep this for now.

435
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:07,980
Where's this place?

436
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,870
Who am I?

437
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:12,070
Where's my home?

438
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:38,000
Is this where your owner lives?

439
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:43,850
Who am I?

440
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:16,430

♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

443
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:26,570
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

444
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:35,780
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

445
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:39,840
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

446
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:45,140
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

447
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:50,870
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

448
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:57,140
♫ All are just illusions ♫

♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

451
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:13,780
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

452
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:19,950
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

453
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:25,370
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

454
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:30,610
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

455
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:33,550
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

456
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:42,100
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from my previous life ♫

457
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:54,540
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

458
00:43:54,540 --> 00:44:00,000
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

459
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,410
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

460
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:10,560
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

461
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:15,960
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

462
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:21,390
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

463
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:24,180
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

464
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:32,920
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

465
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:46,290
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
