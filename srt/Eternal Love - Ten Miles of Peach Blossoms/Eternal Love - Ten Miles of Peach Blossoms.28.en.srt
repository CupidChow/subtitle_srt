♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:21,170
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:24,630
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,000
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,480
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,120
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,850
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,310
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,960
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,410
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,200
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,380
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14

♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,580
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16

♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,090
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,010
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,810
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,710
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:31,910
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:34,370
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:38,940
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27

31
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:28,220
Your Mighty Monarch, Her Highness asks to see you!

32
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:32,920
Her Highness said that she has a way of saving Su Su!

33
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,320
I beg Your Highness the Crown Prince to visit Her Highness!

34
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,670
She will surely tell you the method.

35
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:46,970
I beg Your Highness the Crown Prince to visit High Highness...

36
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:51,080
Do you know the punishment of deceiving a crown prince?

37
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,780
Your Mighty Monarch, I dare not! I dare not!

38
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,420
I dare not deceive you, Your Mighty Monarch!

39
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,080
I beg you to visit Her Highness.

40

She will surely tell you the method.

41
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,750
It was Her Highness who told me all these.

42
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:09,930
I dare not lie to you, Your Mighty Monarch.

43
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:15,220
I beg Your Mighty Monarch to visit her.

44
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:31,550
Ye Hua, tonight is supposed to be our first night as husband and wife.

45
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:34,900
I've looked forward to it for tens of thousands of years.

46
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,490
I know that you're waiting for me to say that method.

47
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:48,350
Ye Hua, we knew each other since we were little.

48
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:51,720
You surely know that I hate her so much,

49
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,830
but I will still help you save her.

50
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,310
Although I'm an orphan,

51
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:03,830
my life was smooth sailing for 70,000 years.

52
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:07,010
Only on the thought of marrying you,

53
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:11,430
I kept being pushed to the edge.

54
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,480
I refuse to accept it.

55
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,990
I can't accept it.

56
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,850
What do you want?

57
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:26,560
I want... to enter Pure Wutong Palace.

58
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,710
I won't lie to you!

59
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,840
No one can deceive the crown prince of the Nine Heavens.

60
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,530
You need to use that Soul-Gathering Lamp.

61
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:47,490
If it's the Soul-Gathering Lamp, I can just ask Emperor Dong Hua.

62
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,220
No, he only knows how to gather the spirit of an immortal,

63
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,190
but he doesn't know how that lamp can create mortal blood and bone.

64
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,500
Only I know.

65
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,090
Continue speaking.

66
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,750
Have you agreed?

67
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,580
Even if you enter Pure Wutong Palace, I won't marry you.

68
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,550
It's fine.

69
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,510
It's fine.

70
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:23,010
I just want to see you more often. Like when we were young.

71
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,410
Sure. Speak.

72
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,410
I will agree.

73
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,490
Thank you, Your Mighty Monarch.

74
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:40,610
Your Mighty Monarch, you just need to put items with that mortal's spiritual breath

75
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,120
into the Soul-Gathering Lamp to be burned overnight.

76
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,890
Let that lamp recognize that mortal's spiritual breath

77
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:52,890
and it will slowly absorb that mortal's breath that has been left within thousand of miles.

78
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:57,370
Once it has absorbed all of it,

79
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:04,510
it can then create an identical person from that one whose soul and spirit dissipated.

80
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:13,260
Ye Hua! Do you not want to see her?

81
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,420
Even if it's a fake?!

82
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,550
Ye Hua! Ye Hua!

83
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,520
Your Highness...

84
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:36,860
His Mighty Monarch asked me to carry you into Pure Wutong Palace.

85
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,210
His Highness has one more message.

86
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:49,050
No matter what the heavenly decree stated, Pure Wutong Palace only has one royal consort named Su Su.

87
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:53,000
When you enter Pure Wutong Palace, you're not allowed to approach the Courtyard of Moonlight.

88
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,660
Without the decree of His Mighty Monarch, you're not allowed to go near the Young Heavenly Grandchild.

89
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,550
Yes.

90
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:08,150
As long as he's willing to let me in, I'm willing to obey his will.

91
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:15,870
Go. Prepare a palanquin.

92
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,240

♫ I foresaw all of your joy and sadness ♫

156

♫ Three thousand flowers just to remember you ♫

157
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:15,030
Mother, Father Monarch and I are going to live again in the place where you two got married!

158

♫ Counting years and months is only to see your face when the flower blossoms ♫

159
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,520
Father Monarch, can I live here for a few days?

160
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:31,190
♫ I foresaw all of your joy and sadness ♫

161
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:36,190
♫ Three thousand flowers just to remember you ♫

162
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:38,260
Father Monarch!

163
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:43,020
Father play with me!

164
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,980
Sure.

165
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,990
Young Highness, have some water.

166
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:12,820
Young Highness.

167
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:17,270
Mi Gu, do you know if there's anything my aunt wants?

168
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:20,280
I want to gift it to her on her birthday.

169
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,860
I don't know, either, Young Highness.

170
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,400
You're right.

171
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,590
She has no lack of anything special.

172
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:33,910
She doesn't have any unfulfilled wishes, either.

173
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:36,330
Unfulfilled wishes?

174
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,490
She does have one.

175
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:42,310
What is it? Tell me.

176
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:47,170
Young Highness, do you remember that person who must not be mentioned in the Splendid Flame Cave?

177
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:51,870
Yeah! How can I forget him?

178
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:56,690
Ever since I was born, Aunt has always wanted High God Mo Yuan to wake up.

179
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:06,540
But how can I do something even my grandparents and High God Zhe Yan can't do?

180
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:10,940
Recently, I heard a rumor.

181
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:14,010
You might be able to do it.

182
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,730
What is it?

183
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:20,220
Three hundred years ago, just to save His Highness the Crown Prince,

184
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:25,040
Consort Su Jin took a treasure from the Sea of Innocence called the Soul-Gathering Lamp.

185
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,640
I heard that it can gather the spirit of an immortal and recreate a mortal's bone and blood.

186
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,790
His Highness the Crown Prince almost fell into a deep coma,

187
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,140
but he woke up with this.

188
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,930
Really?

189
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,660
- I'll go borrow it.
- Young Highness!

190
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,880
I fear that the Heavenly Tribe won't let us borrow their treasure.

191
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,620
Then I'll sneak it out.

192
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,160
Anyway, Crown Prince is engaged with my aunt.

193
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,470
If he finds out, he probably won't say anything.

194
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:57,150
Moreover, I'm saving their God of War.

195
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,730
They should lend it to us.

196
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:03,710
That's true, too.

197
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,040
[Pure Wutong Palace]

198
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,670
I'll use this evil woman's appearance.

199
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,400
Consort Su Jin.

200
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:51,830
Where is His Mighty Monarch?

201
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:54,100
His Mighty Monarch?

202
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:59,680
His Mighty Monarch goes to live on Junji Mountain of the Eastern Wilderness for several months around this time every year.

203
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:04,590
Did you forget?

204
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:10,310
I did forget.

205
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,370
What are you doing, Your Highness?

206
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,730
I want to go inside to see.

207
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,070
What?

208
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:23,380
As His Mighty Monarch's side consort, I can't even enter his bed chamber?!

209
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,440
You can.

210
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,710
- But...
- What?

211
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:33,760
A lowly official like you dares to stop me?

212
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,700
I don't dare.

213
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,760
- Your Mighty Monarch.
- What is it?

214
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,630
Consort Su Jin suddenly trespassed into Purple Morning Hall. I dared not stop her.

215
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,630
I was worried because the Soul-Gathering Lamp was still inside the hall.

216
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,690
What?!

217
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:10,250
Ye Hua.

218
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:14,360
Where is the Soul-Gathering Lamp?

219
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,120
Soul-Gathering Lamp?

220
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,850
Isn't the Soul-Gathering Lamp inside your bed chamber?

221
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,580
Where is it?!

222
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:25,610
Ye Hua, what's wrong?

223
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:33,360
Don't forget that it was because of that lamp that you're able to enter Pure Wutong Palace.

224
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,390
Ye Hua, you must be mistaken.

225
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:40,800
Three hundred years ago, I gave you that lamp.

226
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,480
I haven't touched it since!

227
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,920
I don't dare. I really don't dare touch it.

228
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,210
I know how much you treasure it.

229
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:53,650
Your Mighty Monarch, please appease your anger!

230
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:01,290
You better not be lying.

231
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:12,810
Your Highness? Are you all right, Your Highness?

232
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:17,180
What happened to His Highness the Crown Prince?

233
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:20,090
I've never seen him so agitated.

234
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,900
It's all for that mortal again!

235
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,880
It's been 300 years.

236
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,220
She's been dead for 300 years!

237
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:39,600
But through that lamp,

238
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:44,020
she is still blocking my path.

239
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:12,170
- Hey!
- Third Highness.

240
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:16,090
Why are you all in a rush? Is the world ending?

241
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:18,980
Third Highness, don't you know? The Soul-Gathering Lamp in Purple Morning Hall is missing.

242
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:22,150
Someone disguised as Consort Su Jin and stole the lamp.

243
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:26,240
His Highness the Crown Prince got so mad that he wants to interrogate each servant of the Heavenly Palace one by one.

244
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,700
The Soul-Gathering Lamp went missing?

245
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,670
That's Ye Hua's life.

246
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:16,420
Ye Hua, I know the Soul-Gathering Lamp is gone.

247
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:23,260
But you see, it's been 300 years.

248
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:26,310
If that lamp can really recreate a Su Su,

249
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:28,560
it should have done so long ago.

250
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:34,080
Why must you still stay entangled to a woman who has died 300 years ago?

251
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,930
Third Uncle, stop saying it.

252
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:47,510
Through this, Su Su is telling me

253
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:51,930
that she still won't forgive me.

254
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:57,830
She won't even let me create a fake version of her.

255
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:19,800
How do you use this lamp?

256
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,190
I heard you have to light it for a few days.

257
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,770
And you can't use magic to keep it burning.

258
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:26,910
You must personally guard it.

259
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:28,920
Won't we be found out?

260
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,020
Aunt visits here twice a day to pay her respects.

261
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,730
What are we going to do if she finds out?

262
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:35,890
I don't know.

263
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,440
What are you two doing?

264
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,550
- Aunt!
- Great Lady!

265
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:46,720
What are you two up to?

266
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,970
I... I borrowed a lamp from the Heavenly Palace.

267
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:55,910
I wanted to help you recover High God Mo Yuan's spirit.

268
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:00,850
What is it?

269
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:02,890
Soul-Gathering Lamp.

270
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:05,030
Soul-Gathering Lamp?

271
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,800
That's a sacred treasure of the Heavenly Tribe.

272
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,830
How did you get it?

273
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,750
I borrowed it.

274
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,480
Tell me the truth.

275
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:20,910
I disguised as Consort Su Jin and stole it from the Crown Prince's bedchamber.

276
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:22,390
You stole it?!

277
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,760
Who gave you the guts to do something like this?

278
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,870
Aunt! I heard there's a lamp in the Heavenly Palace

279
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:30,040
that woke up the previously unconscious Crown Prince.

280
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,630
I thought it could help High God Mo Yuan.

281
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,380
Kneel down.

282
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:39,410
- Aunt.
- What did I teach you?

283
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:42,980
A Green Hill empress like you dares to do such a thing?

284
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:47,150
What am I supposed to do if your father finds out?

285
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,890
Aunt, I was wrong.

286
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:51,000
What should you do, then?

287
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,990
I'll go ask for forgiveness.

288
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:55,830
I'll take responsibility for what I did wrong.

289
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,050
Go.

290
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,240
Are you afraid?

291
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:06,050
No.

292
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:09,180
But it wasn't easy for me to get this lamp.

293
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:12,210
Are you really not going to try to use it?

294
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:16,120
No need.

295
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:23,520
I heard about this lamp before.

296
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:32,190
But to use it, you must find a portion of the spirit for it to be able to gather the rest of it.

297
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:36,800
For these 70,000 years, Teacher's body may be here,

298
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:41,510
but I don't know where his spirit is.

299
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:46,300
So this lamp is useless.

300
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:50,200
Do you really not want to try it?

301
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,690
Take it back.

302
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:59,680
Yes.

[Early Dawn Palace]

304
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,980
Young Highness, why are you here?

305
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:42,120
I disguised as Consort Su Jin and stole the Soul-Gathering Lamp.

306
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,700
- You disguised as Su Jin and stole the Soul-Gathering Lamp?
- Yes.

307
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:48,850
Oh no. You caused big trouble.

308
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:50,460
I just took it for a few days.

309
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,520
I didn't think it would be a big deal.

310
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:56,440
Do you know why this lamp hasn't gone out for 300 years?

311
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,230
His Highness the Crown Prince was using this lamp to recreate the blood and bone of the late Lady Su Su.

312
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:02,960
What?! Su Su's blood and bone?

313
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,600
He hasn't forgotten about that mortal since then?

314
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,580
His Highness the Crown Prince has protected that light for 300 years.

00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:12,290
No one dares to go near Purple Morning Hall.

316
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:16,370
How can you sneak in and steal it?

317
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:19,450
Is the fire still lit?

318
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:21,500
It went out.

319
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,970
Oh, no.

320
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:29,660
Emperor is still in seclusion to cultivate, so he can't help you.

321
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:35,760
I'll see what I can do to save you from punishment.

322
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:52,860
Young Highness, wait here.

323
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,110
Third Highness and I will go in to talk to him.

324
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:59,120
I hope His Highness the Crown Prince can be magnanimous and let this matter go.

325
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,570
Thank you, Your Third Highness.

326
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:06,860
Don't thank me too soon.

327
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:10,700
You don't know how important this Soul-Gathering Lamp is for Ye Hua.

328
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:14,740
Just let me and Si Ming go in first to see the situation.

329
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,470
It went out.

330
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,720
It went out?

331
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,250
Who did it?

332
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:44,280
The Young Highness of Green Hill, Bai Fengjiu.

333
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:47,500
Bai Fengjiu?

334
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:52,410
She didn't know you were using this to create Su Su's blood and bone.

335
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:59,730
She thought it looked interesting and took it to play.

336
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:05,530
Interesting?

337
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:11,890
Ye Hua, give Green Hill some face.

338
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:14,210
Don't pursue this anymore.

339
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:20,840
No matter what, her aunt is your future main consort.

340
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:27,440
If you fight with Green Hill because of a deceased mortal, it would just lead to greater disaster.

341
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,550
It's unreasonable whether in reason or affection.

342
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:41,310
What if I want to cause trouble?

343
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:52,510
Then... I can only use... Emperor Dong Hua's name to beg you for leniency.

344
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,820
Let me be frank.

345
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:58,030
Emperor is going down the mortal world soon to undergo tribulations.

346
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:02,500
This tribulation is to pay back the Young Highness for a debt of affection.

347
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:10,100
Hence, may Your Highness the Crown Prince forgive Bai Fengjiu for the sake of Emperor Dong Hua.

348
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:26,980
Give Green Hill some face.

349
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,780
Give Emperor Dong Hua some face.

350
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:33,310
Don't make a fuss about it anymore.

351
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:38,870
Even if this lamp can really recreate a Su Su,

352
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:41,630
it's just a substitute.

353
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:49,630
- I beg Your Highness Crown Prince—
- Tell her to leave!

354
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,260
Thank you, Your Highness!

355
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,250
How did it go?

356
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:37,060
His Highness the Crown Prince decided not to pursue this.

357
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:43,190
Young Highness, you can't continue being so willful.

358
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,610
I didn't know that he was recreating Su Su's blood and bone.

359
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:49,310
I thought no one used it ever since it woke up His Highness the Crown Prince.

360
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:51,160
Sure.

361
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,320
Young Highness, please go back.

362
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:56,790
I... What about Su Jin?

363
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:59,370
It's easy to take care of Consort Su Jin.

364
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:04,030
I'll drag Third Highness to beg for leniency for you first from Heavenly Monarch.

365
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:05,920
Based on Consort Su Jin's personality,

366
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:10,060
she will surely not escalate this matter in front of Heavenly Monarch.

367
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:16,950
Remember this from now on, Young Highness.

368
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:23,980
Other than the people of Early Dawn Palace, don't offend other people and don't be involved with them.

369
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,050
Or else, I can't help you.

370
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:28,030
Understood.

371
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:31,670
Then... is the Emperor all right?

372
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:34,120
He's all right, very well.

373
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:37,600
In a few days, I might go to Green Hills to look for you.

374
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,560
- Look for me?
- Right.

375
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,580
I've thought of a way to help you repay your debt of gratitude.

376
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,060
- Really?
- It's true.

377
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:46,810
But I can't tell you now. Stay calm.

378
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:50,290
Please wait for me at the Green Hill fox den, Young Highness.

379
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:52,290
Yes.

380
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,260
Are you crazy?!

381
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,540
Let go. Let me go.

382
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:26,480
Let... Let me go!

383
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:34,080
Do you plan to use your own spirit to light up that Soul-Gathering Lamp?

384
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:38,120
Other than that, there's no other way.

385
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:41,960
I don't have any other item that's related to Su Su.

386
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:49,130
Other than my spirit, in this whole Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses, there's no more item that's related to Su Su.

387
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:51,170
That's enough!

388
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:54,760
Have you forgotten you're still the Crown Prince?!

389
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:59,140
Have you forgotten you still have a son with Su Su?!

390
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:02,690
So what if you light it again?

391
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:05,720
So what if you recreate her blood and bone?

392
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,670
Is it still the same Su Su?

393
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:22,430
Think this through.

394
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:30,370
Just to create a fake human, is it worth it?

395
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:34,400
After you die,

396
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:39,540
Ah Li will become an orphan.

397
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:42,900
Is it worth it?

398
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:50,290
It's fine... if you don't want to live.

399
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,050
But what about Ah Li?

400
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:58,080
He's still waiting for you in Eastern Wilderness.

401
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:03,120
It's been 300 years.

402
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,000
You acted as both a mother and a father.

403
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,640
Finally, you raised him to this age.

404
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:15,450
Whom can you entrust with to take care of him?

405
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:20,090
That fake person you make?

406
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:25,360
Or Su Jin, who hates Su Su the most?

407
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,800
Let it go.

408
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:37,030
It's been 300 years.

409
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,740
Don't torture yourself anymore.

410
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:45,660
Forget her.

411
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:09,100
The light really went out?

412
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:15,630
Father Monarch, it really went out.

413
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:17,530
It's good that it went out.

414
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:20,690
This matter has trapped Ye Hua for 300 years.

415
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:22,820
I also was unable to have any peace.

416
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,770
Su Jin.

417
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,150
I'm here.

418
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:30,430
Even though that Young Highness of Green Hill pretended to be you and stole the Soul-Gathering Lamp,

419
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:32,480
she still returned it after all.

420
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,220
At most, Ye Hua just lectured you a little.

421
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:41,400
Look, Si Ming and Third Highness are here to beg on her behalf.

422
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,330
Don't pursue this anymore.

423
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,770
I understand.

424
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:57,360
I'll just pretend that this never happened.

425
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,790
Okay.

426
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:02,570
You are the best at thinking for the greater good.

427
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:27,330
Ye Hua, from now on, there won't be a mortal in between us now.

428
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:33,780
Young Highness. Young Highness, it's time to wake up.

429
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,720
Young Highness?

430
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,360
Young Highness?

431
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:42,340
Young Highness!

432
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:46,750
Oh, no. Where did he go?

433
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:34,770
Little rabbit, are you lost?

434
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:37,580
I'm lost, too.

435
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,040
How audacious of you, monster! You dare follow me, the Heavenly Grandchild?

436
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:54,480
Heavenly Grandchild? Then I'm the Heavenly Monarch!

437
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:06,830
This mountain is so weird. It's as if a divine barrier has been placed on it.

438
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,710
Help me!

439
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:12,870
Help me!

440
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,920
Help me, Older Sister!

441
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:35,320
Are you not going to chase it?

442
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:38,610
This mountain is dangerous. We should be careful.

443
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,460
Why is a little immortal child like you in the mortal realm?

444
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:46,690
I, Ah Li, thank you for saving my life.

445
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:49,330
It's just a coincidence. Where do you live?

446
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:50,810
Should I bring you home?

447
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:53,150
I live in a thatched hut nearby.

448
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:55,800
Thatched hut?

449
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,760
It must be that place covered by the divine barrier.

450
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,550
I lost the Young Heavenly Grandchild.

451
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:01,980
I deserve to die!

452
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,530
Your Highness, please grant me death!

453
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:06,000
- Go search for him again!
- Yes!

454
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,380
Your Mighty Monarch, he's back!

455
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:09,630
The Young Heavenly Grandchild is back!

456
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:13,660
Ah Li!

457
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,920
Father Monarch!

458
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:47,050
”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

459
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:49,060
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

460
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:51,630
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

461
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:57,010
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

462
00:42:57,010 --> 00:43:06,400
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

463
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:10,350
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

464
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:15,520
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

465
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:21,350
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

466
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,730
♫ All are just illusions ♫

467
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:34,610
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

468
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:39,860
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

469
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:44,380
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

470
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:50,510
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

471
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:55,890
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

472
00:43:55,890 --> 00:44:01,180
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

473
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:04,090
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:13,500
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from my previous life ♫

475
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:25,090
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

476
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:30,610
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

477
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:34,890
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

478
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:41,190
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

479
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:46,480
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

480
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:51,810
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

481
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:54,630
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

482
00:44:54,630 --> 00:45:03,910
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

483
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:15,820
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
