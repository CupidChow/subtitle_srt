”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

2
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:17,560
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,090
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,630
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,040
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,390
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:35,210
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,830
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,280
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,710
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:49,370
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:52,760
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,400
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,830
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:03,490
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,700
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,590
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,040
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,050
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,800
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,150
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,460
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,020
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,910
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:34,520
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,740
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,060
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,890
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,150
[Episode 35]

31
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:22,860
Qian Qian, I've missed you so much in these past few days.

32
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,960
Do you miss me?

33
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:33,130
I'm here to tell you some important news.

34
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:37,620
Do you know who reincarnated as Yuanzhen's father here?

35
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,100
Is it your grandfather?

36
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,870
He's not my grandfather, but it's about the same.

37
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,150
Then...

38
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,720
It's Emperor Dong Hua.

39
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,020
Emperor Dong Hua?

40
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,030
Don't tell me, Young Jiu...

41
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,730
I'll go and close the window.

42
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,670
Are you sleeping on the outside or the inside?

43
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,610
I'll sleep on the floor.

44
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,060
Qian Qian, it doesn't matter if you're sleeping on the bed or not,

45
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,020
the result will be the same.

46
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,110
If you had any powers,

47
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,550
you could probably fight me and we'd both end up badly battered.

48
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,590
But I have sealed your powers.

49
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:12,120
Or maybe, you're just half-heartedly refusing, but also half-heartedly willing?

50
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:18,370
You must be joking, Monarch Ye Hua.

51
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:22,530
I'm just afraid the bed is too small and you might not have enough space.

52
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,840
I'm used to sleeping on the outside.

53
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:51,220
Say, is there really a roc bird here in the mortal world?

54
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,020
That roc bird was borrowed from Buddha.

55
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,900
My second uncle has a grudge with Si Ming.

56
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,830
Si Ming really invested a lot of effort this time.

57
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,110
I didn't think Si Ming would hold such a grudge.

58
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:12,520
He made such a big act only for me to get in the way.

59
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,900
Won't he hate me?

60
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,880
Qian Qian, don't worry.

61
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,510
He still owes me a favor.

62
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,180
Do you want me to hug you to sleep?

63
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,970
I was right.

64
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,530
I know that you don't behave when you sleep,

65
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:48,160
that's why I wanted to hug you to sleep.

66
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,810
The bed is too small.

67
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:53,200
Yes. It is.

68
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,960
Qian Qian,

69
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,910
do you know Divine Monarch Si Yin?

70
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,210
I...

71
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:27,120
I heard about him but I've never met him.

72
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,670
I heard he disappeared with High God Mo Yuan.

73
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,990
I thought you'd know more.

74
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,160
I don't know.

75
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:47,090
Recently, Winged Monarch Li Jing drew a portrait of Divine Monarch Si Yin.

76
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,140
He then secretly went to search for him.

77
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:54,070
I received a copy of that portrait.

78
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:58,940
At a glance, he looks like you dressed as a man.

79
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:08,750
It must be a coincidence.

80
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,180
It's getting late.

81
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,250
Let's go to sleep.

82
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:58,470
Third Highness, are you going to the Peach Meeting, too?

83
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,110
Excuse me.

84
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,420
I don't know why I'm like this today.

85
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,450
Seems like someone is talking about you behind your back.

86
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:08,280
Huh? How can that be?

87
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,640
I am such an easygoing immortal.

88
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,950
There's nothing for them to gossip about.

89
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,640
Where is His Highness the Crown Prince? I just saw him earlier.

90
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:21,560
He's missing a certain high goddess.

91
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:27,070
While the other immortals are toasting drinks, he went to the mortal realm again and will be back in a few minutes.

92
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,790
Qian Qian, come help me tie my hair.

93
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,000
You're asking me?

94
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,030
Mi Gu said you're good at this.

95
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,690
I must see Heavenly Monarch today.

96
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:55,310
It won't be good if my appearance isn't proper.

97
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,170
I'm done.

98
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,720
You used to...

99
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,370
Never mind.

100
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,750
Qian Qian,

101
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,150
take this chain of beads.

102
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,650
You are currently no different from a mortal.

103
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,970
Although we don't know what dangers will come,

104
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,560
it's better to be safe.

105
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:13,020
I must go back to the Heavenly Palace now.

106
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,660
By the way, I was too busy with proper business last night that I almost forgot to tell you.

107
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,300
On June 1st, find a way to stop Yuanzhen

108
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,690
and then find someone to push Emperor Dong Hua into the water.

109
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:25,500
Once that happens, you'll protect Yuanzhen

110
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,590
and also not get in the way of Emperor Dong Hua's tribulation.

111
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:31,070
That's the best solution.

112
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,070
I understand.

113
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:57,360
What proper business was he doing last night?

114
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,500
I almost forgot about Young Jiu.

115
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,860
Teacher.

116
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,160
I was just about to go find you. Come with me.

117
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,930
Yes.

118
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:36,410
Teacher, what happened to your neck?

119
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:38,830
It looks like...

120
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:51,130
You noticed such a small red line.

121
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:56,920
Someone once told me, you have such a kind heart that you wouldn't even dare step on an ant.

122
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,190
Seems like they were right about you.

123
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:07,120
Did you know that not stepping on ants when you walk requires not only kind-heartedness, but also attentiveness?

124
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,040
These two traits are one.

125
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,730
I understand.

126
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:17,790
In that case, I will test your attentiveness today.

127
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:20,540
Yes. Please tell me.

128
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:25,270
I know you've been at the Daoist temple until you were 16 years old.

129
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:27,870
You entered the palace after you turned 16.

130
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,500
So I won't burden you.

131
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,920
I'll ask two questions only.

132
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,890
One is about Daoism and one is about the palace.

133
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,380
In the Daoist temple you previously lived at,

134
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:43,500
there was a nun who always wore white and she often used a duster.

135
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,180
What material is the duster made out of?

136
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,310
Duster?

137
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,640
You don't need to answer now.

138
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,850
I'll ask you the second question.

139
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:58,550
There's a woman in the palace you're staying at

140
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:01,770
who has a Phoenix flower birthmark on her forehead.

141
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:04,040
Where does she live,

142
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,160
what's her position, and what's her maiden name?

143
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:11,180
Teacher, I have not seen much or heard much.

144
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:15,980
When I lived in the Daoist temple, I never met a nun who wore white.

145
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:20,900
As for this woman who has a Phoenix flower birthmark on her forehead,

146
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,650
I know.

147
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:25,610
It is Noble Lady Chen who lives in the Lotus Courtyard.

148
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:29,360
As for her maiden name,

149
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,410
I don't know.

150
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:36,740
Young Jiu really did follow Dong Hua.

151
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:40,000
This attentiveness of yours is hard to come by.

152
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,840
But don't forget, you need to be more attentive to learn Daoism.

153
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,580
You may go today.

154
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:49,850
Try to apply this attitude.

155
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,140
I understand.

156
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,260
Brother Yuanzhen, you're already attentive enough.

157
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:03,850
If you become any more attentive, you're going to become one of the Eight Dukes.

158
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,790
Miss.

159
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,360
Do you have an order, Daoist Priest?

160
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,390
Take me to Noble Lady Chen's Lotus Courtyard.

161
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,360
Yes.

162
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,330
Please come with me.

163
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:27,830
Daoist Priest, this is the Lotus Courtyard.

164
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:42,260
Young Jiu, I'm here to see you.

165
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,370
Aunt! Aunt!

166
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:49,260
I beg of you, please don't take me away.

167
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,660
I love him. I can't be without him. Please, Aunt!

168
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,420
I'm begging you!

169
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,920
I'll do anything for you. I'll repay you.

170
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,630
Please let me be with him, okay?

171
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,250
Aunt, I beg you...

172
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,710
With how crazy she's acting, I think she used Green Hill's forbidden spell, Two Lives Spell,

173
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:06,030
- on herself?
- I'm begging you! I'll do anything for you!

174
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,730
I'll repay you, so please—

175
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,930
Someone!

176
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,140
Take Noble Lady Chen inside.

177
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,070
Yes.

178
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:40,540
Why did Young Jiu randomly use the Two Lives Spell on herself?

179
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:54,220
Aunt, I beg of you. Don't take me away.

180
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,200
I want to be with His Majesty forever.

181
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:01,180
Aunt! Aunt!

182
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,430
That's strange.

183
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,720
Why would Aunt be here?

184
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:16,430
If Aunt learns that I used the Two Lives Spell,

185
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:19,810
she'll drag me back to Green Hill.

186
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:22,570
How would I repay my debt then?

187
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,360
Your Highness, aren't these two very important people in the Heavenly Tribe?

188
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,080
How did they show up here?

189
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,650
Because I am going to use their bodies to save my child.

190
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:45,290
Your Highness, you making puppets to kill Heavenly Tribe immortals is punishable by death.

191
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:47,780
If His Mighty Monarch finds out about what's happening today,

192
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:50,860
it'll be a sin added to another sin.

193
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,380
Your Highness, please send them back!

194
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,630
Shut up! Why would I have a lowly servant like you tell me what to do?

195
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:59,340
- Please appease your anger!
- Guards.

196
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,980
Lock this lowly servant in the Water Prison.

197
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,790
Yes.

198
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:08,030
- Also, call the generals in for me.
- Yes!

199
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,730
Your Highness! I don't dare say anymore!

200
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:13,140
Please! I don't dare anymore!

201
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:24,520
I like this body very much.

202
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:28,960
Greetings, Your Highness.

203
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,320
Come see.

204
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,790
High God Mo Yuan?

205
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:41,840
Didn't he disappear for 70,000 years, Your Highness?

206
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,510
I'll explain everything in a few days.

207
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:50,040
I asked you all to come here to ask you to prepare the Pellet-Cultivating Room.

208
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,120
I'm going to start the furnace and create a spell.

209
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:56,230
I'm going to use the immortal body of Mo Yuan to cultivate a pellet and help my son recover.

210
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:59,780
- This...
- Cultivate a pellet?

211
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,760
That's right.

212
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:09,020
In a few days, my son will have the spirit of the Heavenly Tribe's God of War.

213
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:12,220
Don't you think it's interesting?

214
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,920
Aunt, I, the unfilial one, am here to ask for forgiveness.

215
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,120
You indeed used the Two Lives Spell.

216
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,310
You're wise.

217
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,160
Sit down and talk.

218
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:52,680
Since you came here to repay his kindness, why must you use the Two Lives Spell on yourself?

219
00:18:52,680 --> 00:19:01,140
A few days ago, I went into the Emperor's dream to find out if he had any wishes to be fulfilled in this lifetime.

220
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,410
What did Emperor Dong Hua, who is made of stone, say?

221
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:12,140
Don't tell me he doesn't want anything but just a sincere heart?

222
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,610
You're wise.

223
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,090
The Emperor Dong Hua here is so tacky.

224
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:24,060
Maybe because Emperor experienced some human affection and warmth in his early years here,

225
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:27,390
he just wants to have a woman who won't abandon him.

226
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:31,650
So you got yourself involved?

227
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:34,020
I didn't involve myself in this.

228
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,780
Star Monarch Si Ming said Emperor won't be able to meet his lover.

229
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:41,270
But on the 1st of June, he will find a woman who he treasures,

230
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:44,490
but she loves Crown Prince Yuanzhen.

231
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,770
Yuanzhen?

232
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:51,160
So, I want to give him my heart.

233
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:55,930
I'll leave once he finds that woman he loves.

234
00:19:55,930 --> 00:20:00,500
I thought this was a great idea. But as Noble Lady Chen,

235
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,220
whenever I see Emperor, I can't bring myself to say any sweet words.

236
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,660
Dead ashes aren't that easy to reignite.

237
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,960
No need to blame yourself.

238
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:13,350
Hence, I can only cast the Two Lives Spell on myself.

239
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:17,970
During the day, I will act as if I love Emperor so much.

240
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:22,020
Once the sun sets, I can then be released from it.

241
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:29,160
Have you been taken advantage of by the emperor?

242
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:35,560
Emperor Dong Hua came once to Lotus Courtyard and then left shortly afterward.

243
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:40,190
Look at you.

244
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:44,250
Acting like you love him to death every day.

245
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,750
Why are you doing this?

246
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:51,870
I just think that loving someone means you need to give him your all.

247
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:55,060
I can't pretend to love him only when others are looking,

248
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:59,060
and then act like I don't love him when no one is looking.

249
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:02,000
Forget it. I'll let you go.

250
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,130
Continue to give him that sincere heart of yours.

251
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:16,690
You were so carefree when you lived in Green Hill.

252
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:20,510
Look at what you've become for Emperor Dong Hua.

253
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,280
Seriously.

254
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:32,780
Looks like this Purple Bamboo Garden is an auspicious place.

255
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:35,120
How come you're also here?

256
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:47,620
I forgot to tell you something.

257
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:52,230
The night after you went to the Eastern Sea, Heavenly Monarch's grandson Ye Hua came to find me.

258
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:56,480
He asked me what happened to you 300 years ago.

259
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,770
I told him you fell into a deep sleep after fighting Qing Cang.

260
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:04,910
He stopped asking after that and left.

261
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:09,590
Don't tell me this marriage isn't going to work either.

262
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,220
It should be fine.

263
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,210
That's good to hear.

264
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,050
Zhen Zhen misses your cooking.

265
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:20,250
Come back to the Peach Forest for a visit sometime.

266
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:23,120
But I'm still repaying my debt in the Mortal Realm.

267
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,950
Repaying your debt?

268
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:31,370
This Two Lives Spell you cast on yourself is not bad.

269
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:39,770
Aunt, he threatened me!

270
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:45,140
He's doing it so you can go back to cook for him and Fourth Older Brother.

271
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,970
You're right.

272
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:49,750
By the way, why are you here today?

273
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:52,640
- I'm here for Yuanzhen.
- Yuanzhen?

274
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,460
He's the crown prince's cousin.

275
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:59,210
He did something wrong and was sent down here as punishment.

276
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:01,430
I won't say too much.

277
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:06,330
Didn't you say on the first of the 6th month, a beauty will fall in the water?

278
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:10,360
Yuanzhen will save her and she will fall in love with him,

279
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,320
but Emperor Dong Hua will also fall in love with her.

280
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,950
That's right.

281
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:22,070
So, I need to take Yuanzhen away from Emperor Dong Hua's love tribulation.

282
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:24,550
Have you thought of a solution?

283
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,490
I have.

284
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,590
On that day when the beauty falls into the water,

285
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:33,430
I'll stop Yuazhen and find someone to push Emperor Dong Hua into the water,

286
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:35,320
and he'll naturally try to save her.

287
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:39,270
And once they meet, Yuanzhen won't have anything to do with this.

288
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:43,750
Young Jiu, are you willing to push Emperor Dong Hua in the water?

289
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:49,350
Since I'm under the Two Lives Spell, I forget about myself during the day.

290
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:52,090
I'd be glad to just not destroy your plan.

291
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:54,600
I fear that I'm unable to do it.

292
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,620
Forget it. You're right.

293
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:03,930
If there's no one who can, I'll have to do it.

294
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:16,240
So you were here?

295
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,000
I even went to the Mortal Realm to find you.

296
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,390
Let's go. I've been waiting for you. Let's go to the Western Sea.

297
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:25,660
- Western Sea?
- That's right.

298
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:30,290
When I was in the Mortal Realm, I ran into the Western Sea's Second Prince.

299
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,990
- Mo Yuan's disciple and Young Fifth's eldest senior brother?
- Yes, that's him.

300
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:38,910
I accidentally bumped into him in a restaurant at the mortal world and had a meal together.

301
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,680
And then, someone suddenly came to report about what happened in the Crystal Palace.

302
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,290
I saw him looking anxious while he was listening to it.

303
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:45,630
He kept drinking wine.

304
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:47,720
Hence, I asked him about it.

305
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:52,160
It turns out that you can actually help resolve this matter that's bothering him.

306
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:56,260
- Me?
- That's right, you High God Zhe Yuan.

307
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,940
Let's go.

308
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:13,200
Thank you for coming to save my son.

309
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:19,700
I'm not sure if I can save him yet, but let me see him first.

310
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,350
Yes.

311
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,850
Please.

312
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:46,620
He said that 600 years ago, the eldest prince of the Western Sea,

313
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:49,740
with his already-frail health, suddenly started deteriorating.

314
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:52,470
All the doctors in the Crystal Palace of Western Sea

315
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:54,760
haven't been able to find the cause after searching for so long.

316
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,380
Hence, they couldn't employ any treatment.

317
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:59,530
Then, as the eldest prince started coughing up blood more heavily,

318
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:04,050
they could only send a request to the Medicine King from the heavens to resolve it.

319
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:06,460
But even the Medicine King couldn't figure it out.

320
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:11,080
He could only prescribe two medicines that stopped Die Yong from coughing out blood.

321
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,630
Before the Medicine King left,

322
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:18,780
he said this isn't a physical illness,

323
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:23,330
so there's no use calling him for help since it's not related to physical health.

324
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:28,040
Seeing how they're left without options, they could only ask for doctors all over Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses.

325
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,600
But there's still no one who can help.

326
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,750
Why did this happen?

327
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:51,250
High God, why do you have such a heavy expression on your face?

328
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:53,380
Could my son...?

329
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:57,710
Water Monarch, don't worry.

330
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:00,580
His life is not in danger.

331
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:05,470
Then can you heal him, High God?

332
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,420
Let me think about this.

333
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:27,300
Why are you showing such a weird expression?

334
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:31,510
The eldest prince's illness is very strange.

335
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:34,630
Give me a few days to find the truth,

336
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:36,490
then I'll tell you.

337
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:39,150
It's rare seeing you so serious.

338
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,920
Zhen'er,

339
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:58,100
I miss you very much, son.

340
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,630
- Great Lady.
- Come with me.

341
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:14,910
Sit down and talk.

342
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:17,850
I'll stand.

343
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:21,430
I figured out a way to help Yuanzhen pass his tribulation.

344
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:23,890
- Thank you, Great Lady.
- There's no need.

345
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:25,720
Sit down.

346
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:33,010
Everything is now ready to help Yuanzhen escape his tribulation.

347
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:35,560
We just lack someone who will push a person.

348
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,480
Pushing someone?

349
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,540
To keep it simple, on the first of June,

350
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,410
when the beauty appears,

351
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:45,860
someone needs to push the emperor into the water.

352
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:48,750
Okay. I'll do it.

353
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:52,100
At this time, use the Invisibility Spell.

354
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,930
When that beauty appears,

355
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:58,810
quietly walk behind the emperor and push him in the water.

356
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:04,110
But doing this will cause you to suffer the counter effect of your magic.

357
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:06,450
It's quite dangerous for you to do it.

358
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:09,300
You should find someone stronger to do it.

359
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:13,330
Since this is something that we must do,

360
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:15,960
I'll have my husband do it.

361
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:20,180
That's good. He's Yuanzhen's father anyway.

362
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:24,450
He's indeed the most suitable person to do such an immortal act.

363
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:29,150
I will go bring him to see you right away.

364
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:31,440
Sure. Be fast.

365
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,150
There's not much time left until June 1st.

366
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,180
Rest assured.

367
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:44,590
All are now prepared.

368
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:54,050
High God, you took me in 70,000 years ago.

369
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:59,190
And now, you're about to save my son.

370
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:02,590
You're truly our savior.

371
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:08,800
Your Highness, the sacrificial altar will be completed before the sun sets.

372
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,630
All right.

373
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:17,020
I can wait a few more hours.

374
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,890
What?

375
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:27,270
Bai Qian wants me to push Emperor Dong Hua into the water?

376
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:30,520
- That's right.
- Did you promise her?

377
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:34,370
She said this is the only way to save Yuanzhen.

378
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:35,670
Why?

379
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:38,480
There wasn't enough time to ask,

380
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,030
but if she says so,

381
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:43,570
this must be the most thorough solution.

382
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,790
Don't tell me...

383
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:57,450
She's using this chance to take revenge on us?

384
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:59,280
Revenge?

385
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:06,030
Don't you know that whenever immortals change something in the Mortal World with their magic,

386
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,080
they get punished?

387
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,710
Bai Qian chose me out of all people.

388
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:18,640
Is that not to avenge me for withdrawing the marriage back then?

389
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:23,040
Don't talk about her like that, Mighty Monarch.

390
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,930
She was willing to go to the Mortal Realm to help me

391
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:29,220
because she was willing to ignore the past for the sake of our previous master-servant relationship.

392
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,940
And she's the Great Lady I've always looked up to.

393
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:35,310
With her character, she wouldn't do something like that to us!

394
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,500
I understand. I understand.

395
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:41,170
Don't get agitated. Don't get agitated.

396
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:43,930
I was too narrow-minded.

397
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,920
Please don't get agitated.

398
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:51,160
I'll go to the Mortal Realm now.

399
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,310
- High Goddess.
- Sit down.

400
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:18,580
I have to apologize for what I did all those years ago.

401
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:23,640
No matter the reason, I broke the engagement like that was my fault.

402
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,670
You don't need to mention that anymore.

403
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:28,450
Sit down.

404
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:40,980
Has anyone mentioned that you look similar to Mo Yuan's seventeenth's disciple, Si Yin?

405
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,260
I've met him once. You two—

406
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:49,830
Since you're here for Yuanzhen, let's stay on the topic.

407
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,380
Let's talk about tomorrow.

408
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,190
Yes.

409
00:32:54,290 --> 00:33:00,310
To tell the truth, the person you're pushing into the water is Emperor Dong Hua.

410
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:03,170
I originally wanted your wife to do this,

411
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:06,060
but she's pregnant, so it's not a good idea.

412
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:10,290
Thank you for being empathetic.

413
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:12,020
You're welcome.

414
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:15,630
Let's talk about what you're going to do tomorrow.

415
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:17,290
All right.

416
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:23,090
When tomorrow comes, you first need to use the invisibility spell...

417
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:23,820
Your Highness the Crown Prince, you're really worried about High Goddess.

418
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:27,710
After all, this involves Emperor Dong Hua.

419
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:32,820
Your Highness, don't worry. Emperor isn't a petty person.

420
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,540
It's almost time. The roc bird is about to come.

421
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:54,850
I need to summon Yuanzhen over soon.

422
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,360
Go bring the crown prince here.

423
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,270
Yes.

424
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,790
Your Highness the Crown Prince, your teacher calls.

425
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:08,730
Teacher?

426
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:24,470
Teacher, do you need me to do something?

427
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:26,290
You're just in time.

428
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:30,760
I don't know why, but a white light suddenly flashed through my mind earlier,

429
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:34,300
and I finally understood all the principles I couldn't understand before.

430
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,770
Do you know why?

431
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:38,490
Of course, I would like to know.

432
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:41,340
That would be great. Go to the Crown Prince Hall to wait for me.

433
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,660
I'll be there soon.

434
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:51,280
Is this performance more important than the Daoism I am about to teach you?

435
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,560
No. I was wrong.

436
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,010
I will head back soon.

437
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:12,890
Look! That seems like a... roc bird.

438
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,950
I can't believe such a huge roc exists in this world.

439
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:26,680
That giant roc looks so ferocious.

440
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,730
It's flying so fast.

441
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:32,790
Such a big roc bird has only been mentioned in scriptures before.

442
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:36,070
Could its appearance now be a sign of something?

443
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:41,940
Your Majesty, this clearly is an auspicious sign.

444
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,940
Auspicious sign?

445
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:48,360
Just based on one bird, you say that it's an auspicious sign?

446
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,390
Your Majesty, it's dangerous!

447
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:52,260
Shut up!

448
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,930
Watch out, Your Majesty!

449
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:13,570
Your Majesty!

450
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,380
Save me!

451
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,560
Your Majesty, don't get near the water!

452
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,730
Your Majesty!

453
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:24,070
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

454
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:26,080
- Help me!
- Guards!

455
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,770
Go save her!

456
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:33,510
- Your Majesty!
- His Majesty has fallen in the water!

457
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:36,100
- Your Majesty!
- Someone save him!

458
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:39,280
- Your Majesty!
- His Majesty can't swim!

459
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:44,040
- Your Majesty!
- Guards!

460
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,020
Come! Hurry!

461
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,670
Hurry.

462
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:53,040
Hurry come and save His Majesty!

463
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,850
Your Majesty!

464
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:57,040
Your Majesty!

465
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,290
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

466
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:08,190
I calculated everything, but I didn't realize Dong Hua reincarnated into someone who can't swim.

467
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:11,330
Who is going to save this beauty now?

468
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,320
Your Majesty!

469
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:18,110
Your Majesty! Come save him!

470
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:20,790
Your Highness, don't use your magic!

471
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:32,910
How are you? Are you all right?

472
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:35,890
Why would someone push me in the water?

473
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:40,220
Maybe because I usually favor you too much,

474
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:43,530
someone got jealous and pushed you as punishment.

475
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:47,510
Ye Hua, using your magic is against Heaven's rules.

476
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:52,670
I don't care as long as you're safe.

477
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:03,400
If you save me, what about Dong Hua and Fengjiu?

478
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,670
High Goddess, they're both fine.

479
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:08,400
This was their original tribulation.

480
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,490
In a few months, Young Highness can fulfill her wish.

481
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,580
That's good. You two should go back to the Heavenly Palace now.

482
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:21,090
The crown prince staying in the Mortal Realm isn't good.

483
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:25,240
I'm not done here either so I'll be leaving first.

484
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,930
Your Majesty!

485
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:37,860
Your Majesty, wake up!

486
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:40,360
Your Majesty! Wake up!

487
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,590
Your Majesty! I'm begging you.

488
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:46,060
Your Majesty!

489
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:49,060
I'm begging you. Please wake up, Your Majesty.

490
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:52,900
I can't live without you, Your Majesty.

491
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,430
Your Majesty.

492
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,320
You saved me.

493
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:10,180
Don't say anything.

494
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:11,900
The imperial doctors are coming soon.

495
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:16,280
Please hang in there a little.

496
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:20,160
- Come quickly!
- Your Majesty will be fine.

497
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,390
Come save His Majesty quickly!

498
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:27,240
- Your Majesty!
- Hurry!

499
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,390
What?!

500
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:42,520
You personally tried to push High Goddess Bai Qian into the river?!

501
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,760
Is High Goddess okay?

502
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:48,320
I didn't know His Highness the Crown Prince was nearby.

503
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,730
He personally used magic to save High Goddess.

504
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:55,280
This princess is easy to coax.

505
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,050
I told her to go teach High Goddess Bai Qian a lesson

506
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:02,080
and she was even willing to kill a High Goddess.

507
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:05,840
If she had succeeded, that would be okay, but she failed.

508
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:11,460
It'll be a problem if His Highness the Crown Prince looks into this.

509
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,680
You're so insensible.

510
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,000
How could you do this to the Great Lady of Green Hill?

511
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,990
I understand your jealousy against her,

512
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:30,230
but His Majesty will reign over the Four Seas in the future,

513
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:33,060
so there'll surely be a lot of women in his harem.

514
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:37,430
How can you enter Pure Wutong Palace with such greed?

515
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:40,110
Older Sister, didn't you tell me to—

516
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:42,260
You misunderstood me.

517
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:49,980
But don't be scared.

518
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:53,920
Only Xin Nu and I know about this.

519
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,900
Let's find a way to help you quickly become the crown prince's woman.

520
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:03,660
Let's use this celebration to cover this incident.

521
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,970
Is this true?

522
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:09,030
Of course. I sincerely like you.

523
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,720
So, of course, I'll help you.

524
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,610
Don't worry.

525
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:51,030
”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

526
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:53,130
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

527
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:55,710
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

528
00:42:55,710 --> 00:43:01,090
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

529
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:10,370
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

530
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,590
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

531
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:19,670
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

532
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:25,690
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

533
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:31,780
♫ All are just illusions ♫

534
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:38,730
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

535
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:43,940
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

536
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:48,420
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

537
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:54,590
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

538
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:59,930
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

539
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:05,220
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

540
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:08,070
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

541
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:17,990
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from my previous life ♫

542
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:29,120
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

543
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:34,690
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

544
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:39,090
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

545
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:45,220
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

546
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:50,520
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

547
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:55,860
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

548
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,730
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

549
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:07,820
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

550
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:20,120
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
