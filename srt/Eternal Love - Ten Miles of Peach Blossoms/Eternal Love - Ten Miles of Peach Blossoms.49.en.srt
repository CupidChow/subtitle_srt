”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,560
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,110
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:24,600
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,070
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,450
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:35,200
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,820
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,250
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,920
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,340
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:53,270
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:56,470
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,990
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:03,640
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,060
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,540
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:14,160
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,060
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,820
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,210
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,600
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,790
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:31,830
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,380
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,930
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:42,110
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:46,660
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

[Eternal Love]

30
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,930
[Episode 49]

31
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,500
Aunt, are you really going to marry His Highness the Crown Prince?

32
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,350
Since we have to regardless, it's okay if we marry earlier.

33
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:31,760
No. I'm just really surprised at you and Ye Hua's uncontrollable love.

34
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,320
Marry him if you want.

35
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,960
I don't dare say anything.

36
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:42,480
The discussion of such an important marriage between the Heavenly Tribe and Green Hill is not entirely up to our wishes.

37
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:49,980
Ye Hua's mother brought this up first, so I came back to discuss it.

38
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,190
So, it was Consort Le Xu.

39
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:57,550
- But...
- Second Older Brother, look at you.

40
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,290
The engagement has been set. It's just the wedding ceremony now.

41
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,860
Why are you so hesitant?

42
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:07,270
What about Mo Yuan then?

43
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,800
Teacher?

44
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,640
Since he's my teacher, he's also my father figure, so I indeed need to tell him this.

45
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,150
This wedding was decided by Heavenly Monarch and Father,

46
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,460
so Teacher probably won't say anything about this. Right?

47
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:24,110
Besides, he still doesn't know that I'm a female.

48
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,630
Naive. You are really too naive.

49
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,560
Do you think High God Mo Yuan can't see through Zhe Yan's spell?

50
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,040
They are brothers.

51
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:39,770
I always thought you liked Mo Yuan.

52
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:42,730
Second Older Brother! Don't joke about that.

53
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,720
Teacher helped me go through the tribulation and saved my life.

54
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,410
I owe him a lot for teaching me.

55
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:52,340
To me, he's just like Father; a family member.

56
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:56,840
One day, if I were to die for my teacher, I wouldn't refuse.

57
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,730
But Ye Hua is the only one in my heart. That's for certain.

58
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:06,990
All right. Since you're sure of what you want, I won't stop you.

59
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:10,220
It's just... this engagement has been set for so long.

60
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,910
Why are you suddenly in such a rush?

61
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:16,960
It's because Ye Hua went to Yingzhou on my behalf

62
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:21,290
and used his cultivation to refine the medicinal pill to save my teacher.

63
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:25,360
He doesn't have much cultivation left now.

64
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,340
I'm worried. If he succeeds as the Heavenly Monarch,

65
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:32,770
he wouldn't be able to withstand the nine bolts of lightning and eighty-one uncultivated fires.

66
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,820
How does his succession as the Heavenly Monarch concern you getting married?

67
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:44,670
Since ancient times, the Heavenly Monarch and his Monarchess have received lightning and fire together.

68
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:49,320
If I'm married to him, I can receive these together with him.

69
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,520
You two aren't even married yet, but your feelings for him are so strong.

70
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,880
Young Fifth is really a member of Green Hill.

71
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,400
She's extremely loyal.

72
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:03,170
Fine. Tomorrow, I will write a letter on our parents' behalf and deliver it.

73
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:06,330
- Thank you. Then I'll be leaving.
- Okay.

74
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,950
Where are you going?

75
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:11,030
This is your home; the fox den of Green Hill.

76
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:14,680
Mochi is still little and Ye Hua is busy with official work.

77
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,370
I need to take care of Mochi.

78
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:19,620
What about us? You don't care about us anymore?

79
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,630
Forget about him. Go do what you need to do.

80
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,590
Okay, Second Older Brother. I'll go then.

81
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,760
Look at how genuine this stepmother is.

82
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,960
It's a pity that Ye Hua has a side consort who was conferred by the Heavenly Monarch in his palace.

83
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,610
He and Young Fifth won't be able to form a lifelong, monogamous bond.

84
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:45,680
That's right! I forgot something.

85
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,340
What is it?

86
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:53,420
I'm going to marry into the Heavenly Palace, so I need to pass down my post of Five Wildernesses.

87
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:57,760
I can't be both the Heavenly Monarchess and Green Hill Monarchess .

88
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:02,660
That's right, but our parents only have the five of us.

89
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,050
There are five wildernesses in Green Hill and five emperors.

90
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:07,610
We can't have one person rule two wildernesses.

91
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,070
What I mean is...

92
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:14,300
Among the five of us, only you have a daughter, Second Older Brother.

93
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,400
Why not give it to Fengjiu?

94
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,140
Me?

95
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:22,370
Sure. It's a good idea.

96
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:25,790
But Second Older Brother is one of the emperors of the Five Wildernesses.

97
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:28,610
If Fengjiu really takes over your place,

98
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:31,420
wouldn't the seniority in the family be rather messy?

99
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:38,310
Go back first. Once I discuss this with our parents and eldest brother, we will discuss this again later.

100
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:41,550
Okay, I am going back first.

101
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,480
Aunt, what do you need me for?

102
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,930
Did your father hit you again?

103
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,520
He didn't beat me severely.

104
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,310
What's going on exactly?

105
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:03,630
I don't know the details,

106
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:07,430
but His Third Highness's confidante wanted me to relay her message.

107
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:10,060
She wants you to go to Nine Heavens to see her.

108
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,500
- Primary Monarch Cheng Yu?
- That's her.

109
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,300
She has always been very cautious in what she does.

110
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:23,330
If she asked you to relay the message, it must be urgent.

111
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,410
I'm not very sure about the details.

112
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:29,850
But looking at her expression, it seems very serious.

113
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:34,990
I can't chat anymore. I need to rush back to Heaven to have dinner with Mochi.

114
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:39,040
If you want to sneak out and go to Heaven, ask Fourth Older Brother to help you.

115
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,320
Respectfully sending Aunt off.

116
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,750
You have been smiling the whole day.

117
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,580
What's wrong? Encountered something happy?

118
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:02,340
That's right. Furthermore, it's two happy events.

119
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,810
Firstly, our little Fengjiu is going to take over the post of the Monarchess of Green Hill.

120
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:10,720
Doesn't that post belong to Young Fifth?

121
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,920
This is the second happy event.

122
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,550
Our Young Fifth is getting married.

123
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:17,210
Her Red Star has really moved this time.
(an auspicious sign for getting married)

124
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:20,250
She personally asked my second older brother to discuss it with our parents.

125
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,190
She has also set the date.

126
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,550
It's the second day of September.

127
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,810
Mo Yuan, oh, Mo Yuan.

128
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:31,530
Aren't you saying anything?

129
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:33,520
You are not surprised?!

130
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,610
Even someone like my Second Older Brother was shocked.

131
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:40,800
What's so surprising?

132
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,600
That's right.

133
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,360
Ye Hua's father is already writing down the betrothal gifts.

134
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:57,440
I have many things to prepare, too.

135
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,210
Su Jin,

136
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:04,150
you are the side consort of Pure Wutong Palace and the only consort in this harem.

137
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,610
You must help to manage this, too.

138
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:10,700
Arrange for the palace maids to get ready.

139
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,990
Seriously, there hasn't been such a happy event for a long time.

140
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,410
Your Highness, don't worry.

141
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:28,740
I will arrange everything perfectly for you

142
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,850
and let High Goddess Bai Qian marry in a noble manner.

143
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,290
I wonder when the wedding is.

144
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:42,010
The date is not set yet.

145
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,080
Not set yet?

146
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,090
Didn't Ye Hua previously go to sink Yingzhou in the Eastern Sea

147
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:49,740
and slash the four ferocious beasts left behind by Father God?

148
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,870
He has been punished to go down to the Mortal Realm for tribulation.

149
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:56,240
He will be back in two months.

150
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,110
The date will be set later.

151
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,100
I understand.

152
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,630
High Goddess.

153
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,570
Is His Mighty Monarch in there?

154
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,710
Mighty Monarch didn't know when you would be back,

155
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:28,080
so he told me to wait here for you and take you to him.

156
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,990
Making it so mysterious.

157
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,680
This way, please.

158
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,790
Do you have an order?

159
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,740
It's nothing.

160
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:55,050
I've been here at the lotus pond before.

161
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,990
Why is the fog so dense tonight?

162
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,850
His Mighty Monarch specially arranged this.

163
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:05,530
High Goddess, this way, please.

164
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:17,120
Greetings, Great Lady.

165
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,050
Qian Qian, come here.

166
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,830
Come here.

167
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,870
Qian Qian,

168
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:32,090
these are the immortals of the Heavenly Tribe.

169
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:34,950
Nice to meet you all.

170
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:48,000
Why did you arrange for me a welcome ceremony at the crown prince level?

171
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,930
You are the crown princess of Nine Heavens.

172
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:52,250
Of course, we need to do at this level.

173
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,220
I didn't expect that, sometimes, you...

174
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,820
What?

175
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,540
You are quite likable.

176
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,110
I'm only likable?

177
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:13,300
Greetings, Father and Mother.

178
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,830
- Come here.
- So cute.

179
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:18,730
Mother, why did you secretly sneak here again?

180
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:23,280
I thought it would be many days until I saw you again.

181
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,420
I went to Green Hill to see your uncles

182
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:33,450
and told them to make the arrangements to let me marry your father as soon as possible.

183
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:36,220
Really? That's great!

184
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:47,240
Ye Hua, I went back today to see my older brothers.

185
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,630
Second Older Brother has agreed to talk to my parents.

186
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:55,290
If there are no big mistakes, we will marry on the second day of September.

187
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:59,210
Qian Qian, I fear it can't be done on the second day of September.

188
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,960
Why?

189
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,610
I need to go down to the Mortal Realm for tribulation.

190
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,650
Everything's going well. Why do you need to experience tribulation?

191
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:17,910
I have to go because of those four beasts of Yingzhou of the Eastern Sea.

192
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:20,920
Although I destroyed the Mystical Mushrooms and obtained merit,

193
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:24,090
my killing the four beasts is a major sin.

194
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:27,680
After all, they had half of Father God's divine power.

195
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,350
Even if the merit and fault are evened out, the punishment can't be eliminated.

196
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:34,800
I need to receive the punishment and go down to the Mortal Realm for tribulation.

197
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,630
So it's because of those four beasts.

198
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:44,200
In the past when they injured my father, I really disliked them.

199
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,380
Looks like it's my fate to be in opposition against them.

200
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:52,740
Hence, how long will you be gone?

201
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,340
In the Mortal Realm, it's a life and death tribulation of sixty years.

202
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:59,880
I'll only be apart from you for two months.

203
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,080
It requires two months?

204
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,470
You are leaving for tribulation at the beginning of August.

205
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:11,850
If it's two months, let's move our wedding to October.

206
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:13,730
If it's October, it'll be an Indian summer.

207
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:16,060
It's also a good time.

208
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:25,880
It's just that, although it's two months to me, it's a long lifetime for you.

209
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,140
Did you look at the Book of Fate that Si Ming has written for you?

210
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:34,570
He wouldn't write one that's full of love triangles or whatever, right?

211
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,540
This time, the story is not written by Si Ming.

212
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:40,020
Instead, Heavenly Monarch wanted to leave my Book of Fate blank.

213
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:43,110
What I encounter will be determined by myself.

214
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,380
Blank?

215
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:50,720
That's to say, no one will know how your tribulation will go.

216
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,690
That's right.

217
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,020
Then, I need to give you some reminders.

218
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,030
Speak.

219
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:04,650
Even if you go down to the Mortal Realm and forget your status as the crown prince of Nine Heavens,

220
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:09,120
and that you still have an unmarried main consort in Pure Wutong Palace,

221
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,800
you can't marry other women.

222
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,430
I'm not worried about other things.

223
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:20,160
I'm just worried you might attract an irrelevant woman when you're in the Mortal Realm.

224
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,600
You know that I separate love and hate clearly.

225
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,850
I can't tolerate unfairness.

226
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,600
What will you do if I really attract a woman in the Mortal Realm?

227
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:43,830
If that happens, I'll steal you back to Green Hill and lock you in the fox den,

228
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:46,790
so you can only see me every day.

229
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:50,970
You will see me when you are eating and reading.

230
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:53,420
You will also see me when you are painting.

231
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:59,570
If so, I really want you to kidnap me and bring me there now.

232
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:03,560
Then, is that a promise?

233
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:08,120
Once you are done with your tribulation, go to Green Hill to find me.

234
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:13,040
By then, let's not follow the wedding formalities.

235
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,660
Just follow the rules of Green Hill

236
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,180
and lock you up in the fox den.

237
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:22,250
Sure. Qian Qian,

238
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,380
let's sleep.

239
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:35,330
- You want to go to the Heavenly Palace?
- Yes.

240
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:39,570
When I was in Heavenly Palace, Primary Monarch Cheng Yu took good care of me.

241
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:42,530
She was suddenly anxious and wanted Aunt to relay a message to me.

242
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,860
There must be something urgent.

243
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:48,020
I can't evade this at this time, Fourth Uncle.

244
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,860
You are right. She kept taking care of you.

245
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:55,310
If she wants to see you today, you must not evade it.

246
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:59,470
But your father has banned you from leaving Green Hill.

247
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,420
But Fourth Uncle, you can leave.

248
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,840
You can leave quietly.

249
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,660
As long as you take me with you, I will be able to avoid the barriers that my father set in the valley.

250
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,300
It's not a problem to take you with me,

251
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:14,660
but you must remember that you can't hide this from your father forever.

252
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:18,430
If you escape, your father will definitely try to capture you.

253
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,010
Also, think about it.

254
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:23,780
If you are trying so hard to escape, you are definitely going to the Heavenly Palace.

255
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,850
By then, your father doesn't even have to try looking.

256
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:28,340
He'll go straight to Emperor Dong Hua.

257
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,680
I'm not going to see the emperor this time.

258
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,820
Forget it. Let's talk again when my father finds out.

259
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,160
Forget it. Let's talk again when my father finds out.

260
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:41,400
Fourth Uncle, okay?

261
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,310
- Fourth Uncle.
- All right, you brat.

262
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,940
I will make it happen for you this time.

263
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,350
Thank you, Fourth Uncle!

264
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,340
Fourth Uncle, where are you going?

265
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:08,040
You are not staying for lunch?

266
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,770
I was pondering about whether to visit Die Yong in the Western Sea

267
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:14,380
and see how's Mo Yuan's spirit is doing.

268
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:17,740
Young Fifth is in the Heavenly Palace taking care of her future husband.

269
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,510
She's in no mood to think about the Western Sea.

270
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:23,360
I will tell Young Highness that I won't leave food for you.

271
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,450
Fengjiu is still sleeping. Don't wake her.

272
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:28,710
She hasn't been in a good mood lately. Just let her sleep.

273
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:31,270
Call her right before lunch.

274
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,430
All right.

275
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:44,050
Today, Fourth Uncle... is very caring.

276
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,200
Uncle! Be more gentle!

277
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,020
I almost got hurt.

278
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:09,620
Still so much nonsensical talk. If you don't hurry, your father is going to catch you.

279
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,810
I'll be going then. Thank you for your help, Fourth Uncle.

280
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,500
Since I found an excuse to come out,

281
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,420
if I go back now, I will have problems.

282
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:27,110
Because of that brat, I didn't even get to eat lunch.

283
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:32,310
Forget it. I'll go see Zhe Yan.

284
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,000
High Gods, what are you doing here?

285
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,450
Your Seventeenth Junior Brother is taking care of His Highness the Crown Prince in the Heavenly Palace,

286
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,020
so she has no time to come here.

287
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:55,660
Hence, Zhen Zhen and I are here to see how your oldest brother is doing.

288
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,560
He suddenly didn't feel well last night.

289
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,460
He kept tossing and turning. I thought he had a relapse.

290
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,640
I didn't expect him to lighten up on the second day.

291
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,550
It seems like the shackles for many years have vanished.

292
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,720
He ate quite a lot, too.

293
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,040
- Is this true?
- Yes.

294
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,980
From the looks of it, there will be good news soon.

295
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,960
High God, are you saying...

296
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,010
Your teacher is coming back.

297
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:21,480
Really?

298
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:25,420
I was rude.

299
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,710
It's okay. Hurry up.

300
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:30,650
Take me to see your oldest brother.

301
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:32,280
After you.

302
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,110
Just as I suspected.

303
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:02,490
Your teacher's spirit is no longer here.

304
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,060
I'm guessing his spirit has returned.

305
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:09,270
Then... what should I do?

306
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,800
Don't panic.

307
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,790
Go back to Kunlun Void now.

308
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:17,360
Assemble your juniors and tell them to prepare to welcome the return of Mo Yuan.

309
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,880
Zhen Zhen and I will rush back to Splendid Flame Cave in Green Hill

310
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,680
and check whether Mo Yuan's spirit has really returned to his body.

311
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,850
Yes. I will go back to Kunlun Void now.

312
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:36,370
Looking at him, he really doesn't seem like the eldest disciple of Kunlun Void.

313
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:39,050
He's more like a young boy.

314
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:44,650
Don't even mention him. My happiness is going out of control, too.

315
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:48,000
Quick! Let's go back to Green Hill now.

316
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,820
Go now.

317
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:55,620
After seeing the Heavenly Monarch, I will leave for the Mortal Realm.

318
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,040
Why aren't you letting me see you off to the Mortal Realm?

319
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,220
It's only for two months.

320
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:04,940
If others find out that High Goddess Bai Qian of Green Hill personally sent me off, they will laugh at you.

321
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:08,320
The rules here are so annoying.

322
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,510
By the way, I have something for you.

323
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,810
Take this.

324
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:17,870
Jaded Soul?

325
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:21,410
Do you know why Li Jing gave this to Mi Gu?

326
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:26,130
It must be because I saved him and his younger sister at Yingzhou at the Eastern Sea.

327
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:30,300
Since you saved them, it's appropriate for you to accept it.

328
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:37,490
You must feel strange about why I happily accepted this.

329
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:41,390
You must be afraid that Li Jing will use this as an excuse to find me.

330
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:45,410
I'm leaving first.

331
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:48,620
Go.

332
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:04,010
- Second Senior Brother.
- Second Senior Brother.

333
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:07,280
- Second Senior Brother.
- Listen, the bell is ringing again.

334
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,160
- It's Teacher. It's Teacher.
- Teacher is back!

335
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,450
- Teacher is back!
-This is great.

336
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,830
Teacher is back!

337
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:17,010
Teacher.

338
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:18,590
- Teacher!
-This is great. We've been waiting for so long.

339
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,300
That's right.

340
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,010
It's Kunlun Void.

341
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:39,600
Emperor, do you recognize this bell?

342
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,110
Just as you guessed, this sound is coming from Kunlun Void.

343
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:48,030
Mo Yuan is back.

344
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:09,600
Young Fifth, you can fulfill your long-cherished wish today.

345
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,540
Fourth Older Brother, did you hear the bell, too?

346
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:18,650
Not just that, we just came back from the Western Sea.

347
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,910
Die Yong was tossing and turning around last night,

348
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:23,310
so I used the Soul-Pursuing Spell to investigate.

349
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:27,160
I discovered that Mo Yuan is already no longer in Die Yong's spirit,

350
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,480
so we rushed here to see inside Splendid Flame Cave.

351
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,240
Mo Yuan has been sleeping for so long.

352
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,970
Finally, he picked a good day to wake up.

353
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,800
Teacher.

354
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:44,300
Teacher is going to wake up.

355
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,420
Your Highness the Crown Prince, based on regulations,

356
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,350
before I send you to the Mortal Realm,

357
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:11,510
you must drink this bowl of water from the River of Forgetfulness.

358
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,960
Then, is that a promise?

359
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,910
Once you are done with your tribulation, go to Green Hill to find me.

360
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:21,260
Let's not follow the wedding formalities.

361
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:26,310
Just follow the rules of Green Hill and lock you up in the fox den.

362
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,710
Qian Qian,

363
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:51,400
wait for me to return.

364
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:17,270
What are you doing?

365
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:22,650
I want to become a male again.

366
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:26,100
After all, Teacher only saw me as Si Yin before.

367
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,110
He won't recognize my current self.

368
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:32,210
With Mo Yuan's cultivation, he'd already known you were a female.

369
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:35,360
He didn't expose you because he wanted to give your parents face.

370
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,050
Did you think you really fooled him for 20,000 years?

371
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,590
Fourth Older Brother told me this in the past,

372
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:46,810
but I think he's used to seeing me as Si Yin.

373
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:48,900
Stop deceiving others.

374
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,800
Go now.

375
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:55,330
Don't be afraid. Go see your teacher.

376
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,900
It has been 70,000 years.

377
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:11,360
With the Four Seas and Six Hexagrams, I've seen the Green Hill Great Lake dry up 779 times.

378
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,580
70,000 years is half of my lifetime.

379
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:20,080
I used half of my life just to do this,

380
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,110
to wait for Teacher to wake up.

381
00:28:53,640 --> 00:29:00,790
Starting from today, you are Mo Yuan of Kunlun Void's seventeenth disciple, Divine Monarch Si Yin.

382
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:03,460
Teacher, don't leave.

383
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:17,760
Teacher, I should be receiving this Heavenly Tribulation! Teacher!

384
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:32,140
Teacher! Teacher!

385
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,700
Seventeenth.

386
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,190
Come let me see how you've grown.

387
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:07,630
Teacher.

388
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:15,380
You really are my little Seventeenth.

389
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:26,200
Teacher, you're finally back.

390
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,420
That's right.

391
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,730
I'm back.

392
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:51,970
You look good like this, too, my little Seventeenth.

393
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,160
Teacher,

394
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:00,890
you haven't changed a bit.

395
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:04,820
Is that so?

396
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,330
Mo Yuan, it's been 70,000 years.

397
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:30,970
You're finally awake.

398
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:33,200
Seventy thousand years...

399
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,870
That's right.

400
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:37,910
It's neither long nor short.

401
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:46,150
Young Fifth has been hiding in Green Hill for 70,000 years in order to guard your body and wait for your return.

402
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:49,880
It's too cold here. Let's go out.

403
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:24,930
For the past 70,000 years, I believe you have suffered a lot, too.

404
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:29,030
When my spirit first shattered,

405
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:33,510
it took a long time to put it back together.

406
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:50,100
Mo Yuan,

407
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:53,560
you're finally awake.

408
00:32:53,560 --> 00:33:01,510
Did you think that you could still suppress me without your spirit on the Donghuang Bell?

409
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:04,530
Give me some time.

410
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:07,330
It won't be long.

411
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:10,820
We'll meet then.

412
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,200
Teacher.

413
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:39,060
Zhe Yan.

414
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:46,010
Has anyone who looks like me appeared in the 70,000 years I've been asleep?

415
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:52,970
There is.

416
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:56,500
Your little disciple is very close to him, too.

417
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,920
Little Seventeenth, do you know him?

418
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:07,650
What's wrong?

419
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:10,950
Only when you are here with Mo Yuan, you know what fear is?

420
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:13,650
Don't be shy. Tell him.

421
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:26,130
The person you're talking about is probably... my fiancee, the crown prince of the Heavenly Tribe.

422
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:34,500
Fiancee.

423
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,270
What's his name?

424
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:42,490
When was he born?

425
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:51,700
His name is Ye Hua, born about 70,000 years ago when I brought you out from Kunlun Void.

426
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:03,280
Little Seventeenth, my twin younger brother is kidnapped by you just like that.

427
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:09,080
Why didn't I ever hear that you had a twin younger brother?

428
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,950
I don't blame you for being surprised.

429
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:17,420
About this, I only found out before Father God's death.

430
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:21,850
A golden lotus? Father.

431
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:28,480
I'm going to tell you a story from the past.

432
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:35,680
That year, the four poles broke and Heaven and Earth collapsed.

433
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,850
Your mother, in order to support the Four Great Pillars that held up Heaven,

434
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:42,490
she suffered from a miscarriage.

435
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:46,470
She was originally supposed to give birth to twin boys,

436
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:51,610
but she could only protect the older child, not the younger child.

437
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:57,990
The older child is you.

438
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:02,180
I have a younger brother?

439
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:10,590
I felt deeply sorry to your younger brother,

440
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:16,320
so I exhausted half of my life's divine power to create a divine embryo

441
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:22,040
and used it to create a golden lotus.

442
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:27,100
Now, I'm about to return to a formless mass.

443
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:31,990
I'm entrusting your younger brother's embryo to you.

444
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:37,100
You must raise and protect him in the lotus pond of Kunlun Void.

445
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:45,010
I hope that he will be born into this world one day.

446
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:48,310
You and his blood are connected.

447
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:57,230
I hope you have the good luck to awaken him and protect him.

448
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,760
Mo Yuan,

449
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:08,440
this is my

450
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:14,710
only wish.

451
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:17,790
Yes.

452
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:27,070
It must be when I sacrificed my spirit as an offering to the Donghuang Bell,

453
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:29,190
he finally woke up.

454
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:39,690
I only know that after Father God passed away, you had been diligently raising that golden lotus in the pond.

455
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:43,480
I never suspected the origin of that golden lotus.

456
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,920
No wonder when your spirit shattered, that golden lotus wilted.

457
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:53,680
And not long after, Consort Le Xu of Heavenly Tribe gave birth to Crown Prince Ye Hua.

458
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,800
No wonder when he was born,

459
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,830
seventy-two colorful birds sang for eighty-one days.

460
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:02,080
The mist and clouds in the Eastern wilderness dazzled for three years.

461
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,590
Unexpectedly, it was Mo Yuan's twin younger brother.

462
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:06,040
This is rightly so.

463
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:12,440
Only High God Mo Yuan's twin younger brother, the son of Father God, can be celebrated as such.

464
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:19,540
In the historical records of Nine Heavens, it's clearly recorded that Father God had only one son, High God Mo Yuan.

465
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:24,840
Seems like these historical records can't be fully trusted.

466
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:30,360
Rather than believing these historical records, we might as well read those novels written by Si Ming.

467
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:35,490
Everyone says that Ye Hua looks like Teacher.

468
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:38,840
Even I thought they were the same person when I first saw Ye Hua.

469
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:45,250
Who could've known Ye Hua and my teacher have this type of relationship.

470
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:49,720
Seventeenth,

471
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,300
I want to see my brother.

472
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,940
How is he doing?

473
00:38:55,940 --> 00:39:00,100
Teacher, you just woke up.

474
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:05,510
If you want to recover, you need to meditate in seclusion for a period of time.

475
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:08,930
Ye Hua is currently in the Mortal Realm.

476
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,910
I can't find him, either.

477
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:13,200
Why don't you wait till you have recovered?

478
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,420
Then, I will take him to see you.

479
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,480
All right.

480
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,470
Let me meditate in seclusion in Kunlun Void and wait for him to return.

481
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,880
How are your senior brothers?

482
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:33,780
When you passed away 70,000 years ago,

483
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:38,650
my senior brothers looked for us for several thousands of years.

484
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:44,390
They were subsequently brought home by their families and went to fulfill their respective missions.

485
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:48,920
Kunlun Void is not the same as before.

486
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:54,880
Plus, I don't want you to see what Kunlun Void has become.

487
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,660
It's okay.

488
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:02,890
Let's leave immediately for Kunlun Void.

489
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:06,150
I will obey.

490
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:12,830
What did you say?

491
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:15,990
Emperor is going to comply with tribulation?

492
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:18,770
Fengjiu, you must get over this.

493
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:23,340
Immortals in Heaven, no matter how capable or highly-ranked they are,

494
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,750
they can't escape from complying with their tribulation.

495
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:29,460
In the end, they all returned to a formless mass.

496
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,740
Look at old the emperor is. He has been living for a long time.

497
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:37,550
It's time... he complies with tribulation.

498
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:45,840
I don't believe this. I don't believe this.

499
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,540
I'm going to personally ask him.

500
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:53,980
Emperor! Emperor!

501
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:58,830
Emperor! Emperor, where are you?

502
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:01,890
Emperor!

503
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:22,110
Emperor.

504
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,760
Why are you crying?

505
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:39,180
If you are alive, I will be alive.

506
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:44,020
If you die, I won't remain living.

507
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:53,710
Fengjiu,

508
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:55,720
don't be like this.

509
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,810
No.

510
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:03,710
You are the Monarchess of Green Hill, and you ran here to hug me without any reason.

511
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:05,650
Aren't you afraid of losing face?

512
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:07,450
We were a married couple for many years.

513
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:09,350
Why would I be afraid?

514
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:13,130
That was just a tribulation. How can you mix this up?

515
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:21,650
Emperor, are you still thinking about the incidence between Yuan Zhen and me?

516
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:24,350
Star Monarch Si Ming made me do it.

517
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:27,450
I don't have any relationship with Yuan Zhen!

518
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:29,190
I know.

519
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:34,890
In any case, before you comply with the tribulation, I won't leave you.

520
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:39,090
Who told you I'm going to comply with tribulation?

521
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,310
Aren't you?

522
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:13,870
”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

523
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:15,910
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

524
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:18,560
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

525
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:23,890
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

526
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:33,110
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

527
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:37,220
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

528
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:42,400
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

529
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:48,020
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

530
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:54,830
♫ All are just illusions ♫

531
00:43:55,960 --> 00:44:01,480
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

532
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:06,660
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

533
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:11,180
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

534
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:17,360
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

535
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:22,770
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

536
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:27,990
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

537
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:30,820
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

538
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:40,210
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from
my previous life ♫

539
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:51,810
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

540
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:57,460
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

541
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:01,860
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

542
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:08,090
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

543
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:13,290
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

544
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:18,740
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

545
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:21,560
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

546
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:30,630
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

547
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:43,260
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
