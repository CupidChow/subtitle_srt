”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

2
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,590
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:21,110
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:24,620
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,080
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,380
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,210
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,760
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,170
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,540
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:49,390
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,730
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:56,440
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,780
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,460
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,730
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:10,570
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:14,060
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,950
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,820
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,170
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:24,530
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:28,090
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:31,870
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:34,480
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,730
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:42,090
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:47,280
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

[Eternal Love]

30
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,050
[Episode 30]

31
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:11,120
Why does this wine taste different from the wine I drink every day?

32
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:38,230
Where did that young lad come from?

33
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:55,420
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

34
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,970
♫ And transforming into spring soil ♫

35
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,480
Su Su...

36
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,110
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

37
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:11,350
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

38
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:16,730
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

39
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:21,990
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

40
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,860
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

41
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:34,070
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from my previous life ♫

42
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,210
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

43
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,200
Su Su...

44
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,600
Su Su!

45
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,720
Su Su! Su Su!

46
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:02,030
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

47
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,780
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

48
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,670
Su Su!

49
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,300
Su Su!

50
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,480
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

51
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:24,530
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

52
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:34,560
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫

53
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,690
Did I get hit by a bewitching enchantment set up by High God?

54
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:42,670
I'll just return to visit High God after the Eastern Sea banquet.

55
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,620
How did I get here?

56
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,320
A very interesting dream.

57
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:44,980
What dream makes you so delighted?

58
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,370
A dream of love.

59
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:54,280
In my dream, I seemed to have used an enchanting spell to flirt with a young lad from a decent family.

60
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,290
Oh? That's interesting.

61
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:00,090
Do you remember what he looks like?

62
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,440
It's all because your wine was too strong last night.

63
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,770
I couldn't even see the moon.

64
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:08,760
Of course, I don't remember what he looks like.

65
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:14,680
He seemed to be wearing dark green clothes.

66
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,810
Even I can't break the enchanting spell of your Nine-Tailed Fox Tribe.

67
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:21,330
Here. Go now.

68
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,580
Don't waste time.

69
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,010
I'm leaving.

70
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:32,000
Oh, yeah.

71
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,350
Your fourth older brother has been gone for a while.

72
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:38,790
When you bring the wines, deliver a message for me. Tell him to come back when he has time.

73
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:42,430
It's more or less time to turn over those lands on the hill in front.

74
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,560
It's you who angered him.

75
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,700
You should be the one to get him back.

76
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,040
I don't want to get scolded for your sake.

77
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,920
In here, I am—

78
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,790
I'm afraid I'll be struck by lightning.

79
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,310
Older Sister.

80
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,600
Miss, why did you call me?

81
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,200
I can see that you're surrounded by a divine aura.

82
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,570
You must be an immortal attending the banquet in the Eastern Sea.

83
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:23,200
Can you guide me there?

84
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,210
Come with me.

85
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:38,770
Thank you for leading me here.

86
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:41,220
May I ask which immortal you are?

87
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:46,290
I have been living in Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms, the place where High God Zhe Yan lives.

88
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:50,020
Do you know His Highness the Crown Prince of Nine Heavens then?

89
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,130
I don't know him.

90
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,790
Princess, don't worry.

91
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:37,210
With your beauty, His Highness will surely not forget you.

92
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,880
He must be missing you day and night.

93
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,330
That's right. Even though it's long been decided who his main wife will be,

94
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:46,510
how is it possible that Crown Prince Ye Hua would like that old woman from Green Hill?

95
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:50,460
Old woman?

96
00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:01,420
Weird. How come there are so many water lily leaves on these crystal lamps?

97
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,900
May I ask if you brought your invitations?

98
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,970
Please go in.

99
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:41,690
No matter how hard it is for you to accept it, I'm still the Winged Monarch.

100
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:44,050
Even if your father, the Water Monarch of Western Sea, comes,

101
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:47,270
he must bow to me.

102
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,800
What Winged Monarch?

103
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,520
In our eyes, you are just that scoundrel who stayed below the Kunlun Mountain 70,000 years ago,

104
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,380
who drank and had fun all day.

105
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,050
Shut up!

106
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:00,450
Gentlemen! I fear that you all are just being too hot-tempered.

107
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,010
Just lessen your talk.

108
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,920
Lessen your talk.

109
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,080
Winged Monarch, please appease your anger.

110
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,820
You both are the previous disciples of the late High God Mo Yuan.

111
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,400
Please appease your anger.

112
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,430
During recent years, we have had a good relationship with the Winged Realm.

113
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:23,530
Don't destroy an amicable relationship built through so many years just for some personal grudges, right?

114
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,600
Today, please give me this honor.

115
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,470
Please appease your anger.

116
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,440
Winged Monarch, please calm down.

117
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,480
Your Highness, we've searched everywhere,

118
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,340
but we cannot find Young Heavenly Grandchild.

119
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,980
Ah Li has never been to Crystal Palace before.

120
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,860
I'm guessing that he found it novel, so he went around to play.

121
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,700
Go look for him again. I'll go search in the back garden.

122
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,870
- Yes.
- Yes.

123
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:19,010
Little Mochi, what're you digging for?

124
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:24,100
Pulling grasses. Father Monarch said that the hidden corals below these grasses

125
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:27,080
are the pretties things in the sea bed of the Eastern Sea.

126
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,760
I've never seen them, so I want to pull one out and look.

127
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,750
- Father Monarch?
- Yes.

128
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,330
You're from the Heavenly Tribe?

129
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,490
Yes.

130
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,790
Use this fan to fan it.

131
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:50,420
Just lightly wave this fan, and all those herbs will get blown away.

132
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,220
This fan is so pretty.

133
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,820
It looks like an item of our immortal clan.

134
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,140
Cloud-Breaking Fan...

135
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,420
Please.

136
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,430
Quickly go check again.

137
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,500
Great Lady from Green Hill will be here soon.

138
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,660
Don't let any strong light peek out.

139
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,740
Yes.

140
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:46,020
Did I cause trouble?

141
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,440
It's not only you.

142
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,890
I'm the one who gave you the fan.

143
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,660
Mother!

144
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,010
- Mother!
- Mother?

145
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:06,820
Mother! Mother, why did you abandon me and Father Monarch?

146
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,860
Young Immortal Monarch, did you recognize the wrong person?

147
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,310
Su Su...

148
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,160
Father Monarch.

149
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,740
Teacher.

150
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:38,240
No, he's not Teacher.

151
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,850
He's not.

152
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,870
Unruly!

153
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,370
I mistook you for someone.

154
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,360
She wouldn't talk in such a hasty and fierce manner.

155
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:13,180
Sorry to have offended you.

156
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,770
You are being too polite.

157
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,540
Mother, are you mad?

158
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:25,450
Ah Li, let's go.

159
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,440
Mother...

160
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,580
Ah Li!

161
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,690
We will take our leave.

162
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:55,450
Father Monarch, she and that portrait of mother in Pure Wutong Palace look so much alike.

163
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,670
Pure Wutong Palace?

164
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:02,860
Could he be Crown Prince Ye Hua of Heavenly Tribe?

165
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,510
Great Lady!

166
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,210
Shao Xin?

167
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,890
Great Lady.

168
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,230
We are no longer master and servant.

169
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:27,480
You don't need to bow.

170
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,130
Great Lady, for 300 years, I've painstakingly waited for you at the mouth of the valley daily,

171
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,350
but you never allowed me an audience.

172
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:37,360
Great Lady, do you still hate me?

173
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,850
You've waited for me at the mouth of the valley?

174
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:44,350
Mi Gu never told me that.

175
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:52,700
But how come you've become this fat after not seeing you for 300 years?

176
00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:01,560
Oh, I heard from Zhe Yan that this is your fourth pregnancy.

177
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,830
Looks like you and that Water Monarch have a good relationship.

178
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:08,590
Water Monarch has always treated me well.

179
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:12,290
But I still can't let go of what happened three hundred years ago.

180
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:19,130
Shao Xin, you should know that I don't want to see you.

181
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,460
Although you've offended me before,

182
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,630
in consideration that we were once master and servant,

183
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,660
just tell me what you want.

184
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,100
I'll fulfill you one wish.

185
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,570
I don't want anything.

186
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:36,690
For 300 years, I only want to earn your forgiveness.

187
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:41,020
No matter how long has passed, I still belong to the fox den.

188
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,300
Don't.

189
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,670
You're no longer a member of my Green Hill.

190
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,440
This wish is my marriage gift for you.

191
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,940
Say it.

192
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,090
I'll fulfill whatever it is.

193
00:17:55,090 --> 00:18:00,720
After saying it, the master-servant affection between us will be over.

194
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,510
I've expected you to be mad at me,

195
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:06,960
but why won't you give me a chance?

196
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,650
You really don't understand?

197
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,930
But you've never seen Sang Ji before,

198
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,670
and you said that you would never like him.

199
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:18,870
If you married him, you would never be happy.

200
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:23,090
Also, after losing Sang Ji, you obtained something better.

201
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:33,080
Monarch Ye Hua is very good.

202
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,290
He's the future Heavenly Monarch.

203
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,830
But if I lose Sang Ji,

204
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,390
I will really have nothing.

205
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,440
You are right.

206
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:50,880
I thought you were angry at me for leaving Green Hill without permission,

207
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,130
but it couldn't be because you were angry with me for marrying Sang Ji

208
00:18:55,130 --> 00:19:00,540
because in my heart, you have always had a strong sense of justice.

209
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:05,230
Looks like you really don't understand.

210
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:13,900
Shao Xin, do you remember the people from my tribe who bullied you back in Green Hill?

211
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:32,500
- I do.
- You should know that some of them didn't really want to bully you.

212
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,190
But if they turned around and protected you instead,

213
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,910
they would be the one bullied by others.

214
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:42,220
So, they could only follow the strongest to bully you, the weakest.

215
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:47,340
Would you forgive them?

216
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,560
No.

217
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,720
Hence, treat others as you would treat yourself.

218
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,900
It's reasonable if I don't want to see you.

219
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,320
You also saw that I'm a High Goddess,

220
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:05,100
but I cultivated for many years to only attain this current grade.

221
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,430
My sentiment and comprehension levels are very low.

222
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:11,500
I'm not a High Goddess who has a strong sense of justice.

223
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,710
You are overpraising me.

224
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,880
Don't you still understand?

225
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,800
Although you didn't do it on purpose, you caused me to be ridiculed by Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses.

226
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:36,120
Mother, why do you say that you are a High Goddess without a strong sense of justice?

227
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,920
Mother, you are the High Goddess with the strongest sense of justice in Heaven.

228
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,360
Where did you pop out from?

229
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,130
I didn't use magic to come here.

230
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:50,690
Father Monarch brought me here to look for you, Mother.

231
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:09,980
I didn't know that you were the High Goddess Bai Qian of Green Hill.

232
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,300
I'm impartial.

233
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:18,020
I'm older than you by 90,000 years.

234
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,740
In theory, I'm your elder.

235
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,880
You should call me Great Lady.

236
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:29,540
Ah Li calls you mother, yet I must call you Great Lady?

237
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:33,520
Qian Qian, what kind of logic is this?

238
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,720
Talking about logic.

239
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,320
When I was talking to this lady, you two were eavesdropping for a long time.

240
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,580
What kind of logic is this?

241
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:49,040
Father Monarch and I didn't eavesdrop on purpose.

242
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,710
Father Monarch said that Mother was also pursuing us,

243
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,330
so we turned around over there and came back.

244
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:58,100
When we came near here, we saw this lady talking to you, Mother.

245
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,000
We could only try to sidestep.

246
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,440
Mother, you came after us because you couldn't bear to leave me,

247
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,840
and you wanted to go back to Heavenly Palace with Father Monarch and me. Isn't that so?

248
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,730
Who says so? I merely lost my way.

249
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:15,830
Ah Li is right.

250
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,980
Your mother can't bear to leave us.

251
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,670
Mother, you are the best.

252
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:28,010
When are we going back to Heavenly Palace, Mother?

253
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:30,580
Go back to Heavenly Palace?

254
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,840
Let's go back tomorrow.

255
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:38,380
This is great. Mother is going home.

256
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,090
You haven't been home in a long time.

257
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:42,830
Are you excited?

258
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,020
Excited?

259
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:50,510
Mother, since you two are done talking, let's leave.

260
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,910
Wait.

261
00:22:56,910 --> 00:23:01,000
I... still have something to say to this lady.

262
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:09,220
Go back and carefully think about what favor you want to ask of me.

263
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:12,850
Once you've decided, come to Green Hill and look for me.

264
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:18,500
Thank you, Great Lady.

265
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:22,960
I want it, too.

266
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,770
Little kid, why do you want a weapon of destruction?

267
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:28,200
Mother.

268
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,890
Be good.

269
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:47,630
I suddenly remembered that I have some matters to settle.

270
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:50,720
I will meet up with the both of you again tomorrow. I'm leaving.

271
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:57,430
Qian Qian, are you afraid that entering the banquet with us will fuel gossips?

272
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:01,480
Monarch Ye Hua, you are overthinking.

273
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:08,110
So, you know that we have a marriage agreement.

274
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,630
We don't need to avoid people's suspicions.

275
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:11,910
Marriage agreement?

276
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,160
Talking about this... When Heavenly Monarch wanted to engage me to your Second Uncle,

277
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,270
you weren't even born yet.

278
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:27,230
In the blink of an eye, you have grown up a lot.

279
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:31,810
The years are really not forgiving. I'm leaving.

280
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:34,000
Immortal colleagues, please wait.

281
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:41,190
Your Highness the Crown Prince. Your Young Highness.

282
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:44,700
This immortal, I wonder how I offended you.

283
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:49,350
In a day when I'm celebrating, you just have to vent your anger on my garden.

284
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:54,240
Water Monarch, do you mistake me for someone else?

285
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,500
Don't you dare to deny it? The coral sprite in my garden personally saw it.

286
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,260
That gale was done by a young immortal in a green dress.

287
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:03,400
Even if you want to deny it, you can't.

288
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:08,500
I can't push the child to admit his sin.

289
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:16,960
Water Monarch, you are right.

290
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,370
I have previously been living in the Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms forest,

291
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:25,040
so this is the first time I'm out here and created such a disaster.

292
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:29,740
I caused you to lose your good mood and also embarrassed my High God.

293
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,820
Water Monarch, please punish me.

294
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,960
Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms?

295
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,330
You are from Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms?

296
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:38,160
Yes.

297
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:42,240
Isn't the High God of Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms...?

298
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:48,970
My High God indeed hasn't communicated with other immortals for a long time.

299
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:52,790
I came this time because of a request by High Goddess Bai Qian of Green Hill;

300
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:56,430
hence, I was fortunate to come and see this Crystal Palace.

301
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,020
High Goddess Bai Qian?

302
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,680
Did Great Lady come here with you?

303
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,690
Great Lady didn't come.

304
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:08,030
When she was a guest at the peach blossoms forest, she fell sick.

305
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:11,220
But Great Lady previously received your invitation,

306
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,010
and she didn't want to spoil your good mood.

307
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:17,170
Hence, she entrusted me to bring these gifts here.

308
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,990
These are the gifts from High Goddess Bai Qian, a luminous pearl,

309
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:28,070
and next to it, are peach blossoms wine personally brewed by my High God.

310
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:32,030
I'm just here to deliver these gifts.

311
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:36,280
I didn't expect to create such a disaster.

312
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,790
Water Monarch, please punish me.

313
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,790
You came from afar and I didn't welcome you.

314
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,300
It's my fault, too.

315
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,830
Please don't feel guilty.

316
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:46,710
I would like to invite you to the front hall to have a cup of wine.

317
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,300
There's no need for this.

318
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,700
After all, my High God doesn't like me loitering outside.

319
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,910
Immortal, you are too formal.

320
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,480
Water Monarch, you are too hospitable.

321
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,260
I'm taking my leave.

322
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:03,100
It's just a cup of wine.

323
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,500
No need to be so courteous.

324
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,960
It was only just a small lie.

325
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,180
This lie was to safeguard that little mochi of his.

326
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:25,990
He could have turned a blind eye, but insisted on going against me instead.

327
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:27,550
So infuriating.

328
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:31,390
Su Su, did you really forget me?

329
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:33,940
Or are you pretending?

330
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:45,070
Your Highness the Crown Prince. Immortal. The main hall is just in front.

331
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,780
This way, please.

332
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:06,510
His Highness the Crown Prince is here!

333
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:12,000
Greetings, Your Highness the Crown Prince!

334
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:33,410
Your Highness the Crown Prince, please take your seat.

335
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:35,530
Water Monarch, please.

336
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:53,470
It's her?

337
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,740
You know this princess, too?

338
00:29:55,740 --> 00:30:00,540
I do, but I'm not close with her.

339
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:18,930
Did Your Highness the Crown Prince drag me here to shield you from your admirers?

340
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:22,350
What admirer?

341
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:12,660
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

342
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:16,560
I boldly ask that Your Highness the Crown Prince meet with my younger sister.

343
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:20,100
See? The admirer has come.

344
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,530
Take care of Ah Li first.

345
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:23,520
I'll be back in a while.

346
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:32,700
He's not really planning to drag me to the Heavenly Palace, right?

347
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:40,070
Mother, where are you going?

348
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:45,740
I'll go look for your Father Monarch and give you back to him.

349
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,430
Oh?

350
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:52,390
You're worried about him having a rendezvous with a beautiful woman;

351
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:56,040
hence, you're using me as an excuse. Right?

352
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,330
What does your little brain usually think about?

353
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:02,500
Your Father Monarch is such an upright man.

354
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,260
How could he have a rendezvous with some woman? Let's go.

355
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:09,790
It's really regretful that we couldn't see Great Lady today.

356
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,310
Did Great Lady not come today

357
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:16,040
because she learned that Crown Prince and the Northern Sea Water Monarch would both be attending?

358
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:21,960
Afraid that the situation would get so awkward if she meets her former and current fiancés?

359
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,220
Awkward?

360
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:33,090
Eldest Senior Brother?

361
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:35,460
Now is not the good time for us to meet.

362
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,190
Let's go.

363
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:44,280
High Immortals, long time no see.

364
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,460
I'm really happy to see you two today.

365
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,940
- Come. Please come in.
- Okay.

366
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,450
Okay.

367
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:59,670
Mother, why are your eyes red?

368
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:01,640
It's been so long since I've been here in the Crystal Palace.

369
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,410
I'm a bit not used to the humidity.

370
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:06,960
Let's go look for Father Monarch then.

371
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,630
Ye Hua is having a rendezvous with his lover.

372
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:11,590
If I go there like this, am I not being too insensible?

373
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:14,290
Mother, let's quickly go.

374
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,730
Hey! Hey!

375
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:22,640
Your Father Monarch might not want to get interrupted.

376
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,180
If you don't go in to separate those love birds,

377
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:29,030
Father Monarch will be stolen by that Princess Miao Qing.

378
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:32,040
Look. Your Father Monarch is in the prime of his youth.

379
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,130
That Miao Qing is also a young budding beauty.

380
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:39,180
It's just usual for young men and women to think and admire each other.

381
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,160
Since they are already lovebirds,

382
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:45,250
why must we separate them. Right?

383
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:48,490
It's not good to destroy other people's marriage. Okay?

384
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:53,130
What deep grudge do you have against that Miao Qing that you have to break them apart?

385
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:57,380
Mother, are you scolding me?

386
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,290
Okay, okay.

387
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:03,250
Although she saved me once, I've expressed thanks to her.

388
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:07,570
She then assumed that she would be treated differently by Father Monarch

389
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:10,510
and insisted on staying in your Junji Mountain, refusing to leave.

390
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:14,250
She's infatuated and kept pestering Father Monarch. So annoying.

391
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:17,920
A debt of life is a big deal.

392
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:21,570
How could it be repaid by just saying thanks?

393
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:22,810
She's overstepping her boundaries.

394
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,860
She clearly knows that Father Monarch has a wife,

395
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:28,250
yet she keeps pestering Father and even lived in your house.

396
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:32,580
She used your cookware and even wants to steal your husband?!

397
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:37,250
Earlier, you said that Junji Mountain of the Eastern Wilderness is owned by Su Jin?

398
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,480
No. No. Not Su Jin.

399
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,300
It's yours.

400
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:44,820
Father Monarch said that you were a mortal before.

401
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:48,920
You two met at Junji Mountain of the Eastern Wilderness.

402
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:53,000
Your mother is a mortal and not Su Jin?

403
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,420
Mother, why are you confused again?

404
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,440
You gave birth to me.

405
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,320
I never thought that His Highness the Crown Prince's only son is actually from a mortal.

406
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,240
But you've never seen me before, so how did you recognize that I'm your mother?

407
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,230
Father Monarch drew two portraits and hanged them in his bedchamber and the thatched hut.

408
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:13,240
It's exactly how you looked like in the garden earlier.

409
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,860
A woman wearing a green dress and eyes covered with a white blindfold.

410
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:18,230
No wonder.

411
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:23,320
Father Monarch said that after you gave birth to me, you jumped off the Immortal Execution Platform.

412
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:27,390
And he said that you went to the mortal world and would eventually return.

413
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:29,920
Immortal Execution Platform?

414
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,190
So his mother abandoned him and jumped off the Immortal Execution Platform.

415
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:35,820
I'm sure that even her corpse wasn't found.

416
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:38,620
This child is so pitiful.

417
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:43,900
Mother, you look so indifferent.

418
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:48,490
Is it because you love someone else and don't want me and Father Monarch anymore?!

419
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:54,240
Look. Your father and I are indeed engaged to be married,

420
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,900
but we only saw each other today.

421
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:59,320
It's really too early to say that we care for each other.

422
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,530
Excuses! My dad is marrying my stepmother, while my mom is marrying my stepdad!

423
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:04,460
The meaning of my name came true!
("Li" means "to separate")

424
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,300
I deserve to not have a united family!

425
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:09,280
I should end up alone and lonely! You all don't want me!

426
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,360
I'll just live alone then!

427
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,210
Okay, okay. Don't cry.

428
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:17,980
Don't cry anymore.

429
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:24,650
My goodness, since I'm your mother, how could I not want you?

430
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:26,800
It's all right now. It's all right now.

431
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,400
Don't cry anymore.

432
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,950
But you don't want Father Monarch.

433
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:34,390
If you don't want him, he'll marry that Miao Qing.

434
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:37,450
Once he marries her and they have another child,

435
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:39,720
he won't want me anymore.

436
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:43,130
Stop crying.

437
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:49,240
Since I... I'm your mother, how could I not want your Father Monarch?

438
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:54,630
Your Father Monarch is my heart, my liver, my precious sweet fruit.

439
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,360
Isn't that so?

440
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,390
Really?

441
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:01,390
It's more real than real gold.

442
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:04,450
Then Mother, come with me quickly.

443
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:15,290
Mother, it's your turn to appear.

444
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:19,350
Let me think of how I should appear.

445
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:32,860
Greetings, Father Monarch.

446
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,730
Mochi.

447
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:54,480
You are...?

448
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:59,990
This child calls me "Mother."

449
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:16,190
With a scenery like this, I couldn't help but get in an artistic mood to make a poem.

450
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:19,010
What do you say, Little Sister?

451
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:25,850
Vast sky, wide wilderness,

452
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:29,640
there's a red apricot that wants to go out of the wall.
(T/N: pertaining to infidelity)

453
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:34,870
Little Sister, do you think it fits this scene?

454
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:39,210
Your Highness, please appease your anger! I didn't know that you were here.

455
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:41,690
I dare not wish to be you little sister. (T/N: to share a husband)

456
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:46,450
I just admire His Highness, but I'm not asking him to promise me anything.

457
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:50,270
My older brother wants to marry me off to the Western Sea.

458
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:53,860
That second prince of the Western Sea is a hedonistic young lad.

459
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:58,240
I had no choice but to come up with this idea of dancing then asking him to meet up.

460
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,210
I only wish to follow His Mighty Monarch for all eternity,

461
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:03,010
just to be a maidservant to attend to him.

462
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:06,900
I have no other intentions. May Your Highness allow it!

463
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:12,120
Is that second prince of the Western Sea you've mentioned, Die Feng?

464
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,930
Indeed.

465
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,560
How is he hedonistic?

466
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,270
Quickly tell me.

467
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:23,070
He...

468
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:29,450
He indeed was an upright gentleman back in Kunlun Void.

469
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:32,380
But since High God Mo Yuan died,

470
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:35,240
he became depressed when he returned to the Western Sea.

471
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:39,160
He would drink wine and be merry all day; taking pleasure in beautiful women.

472
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,130
Really?

473
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:44,530
All that I've said are true.

474
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:47,840
I reckon that Eastern Sea Water Monarch is rushing to let his little sister be connected with Ye Hua,

475
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,500
that's why he instigated her to say that.

476
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,380
Looking at her, she has long developed deep feelings towards Ye Hua.

477
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:55,620
It will not be good for Eldest Senior to marry her.

478
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:59,780
Little Mochi,

479
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:06,120
looks like the sun and moon can bear witness to the sincere love of this lady towards your Father Monarch.

480
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:09,850
I really am unable to separate them.

481
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:12,110
I better just leave.

482
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,740
Don't leave!

483
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:19,420
Mother, you even said earlier that Father Monarch is your heart, your liver, your precious sweet fruit.

484
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:23,190
Other people are trying to steal Father Monarch away, and you're just letting them do so.

485
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:26,650
You're going against your words!

486
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:28,600
I—

487
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:34,550
You said... that I'm your heart,

488
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:38,710
your liver, your precious,

489
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:42,770
your sweet fruit?

490
00:40:55,510 --> 00:41:02,880
Su Su, are you pretending to be dumb, or have you really forgotten me?

491
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,420
Oh, no.

492
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:10,990
Is it possible this Crown Prince can't handle sweet words, became delirious, and thinks that I'm his wife?

493
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:15,650
You... clearly know, yet you still have to make me say it.

494
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:17,780
Hateful.

495
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:35,160
Father Monarch, aren't you going to go after Mother?

496
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,470
No need to chase her. I know where she will go.

497
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:42,090
Okay. Are we still going to stay here tonight?

498
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:43,970
No.

499
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:45,910
We'll go to Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms.

500
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:49,910
- Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms? You're taking me with you?
- Yes.

501
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:53,650
I have some things to ask High God Zhe Yan.

502
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:25,350
”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

503
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:27,360
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

504
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:30,000
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

505
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,320
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

506
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:44,660
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

507
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:48,590
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

508
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:54,000
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

509
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,710
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

510
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:06,190
♫ All are just illusions ♫

511
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:12,930
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

512
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:18,170
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

513
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:22,620
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

514
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:28,720
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

515
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:34,260
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

516
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:39,430
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

517
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:42,310
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

518
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:52,090
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from my previous life ♫

519
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:03,390
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

520
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:08,920
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

521
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:13,310
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

522
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:19,490
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

523
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:24,790
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

524
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:30,160
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

525
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,800
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

526
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:42,390
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

527
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:54,190
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
