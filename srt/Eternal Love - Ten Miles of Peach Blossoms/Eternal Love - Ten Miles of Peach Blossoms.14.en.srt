”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

2
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,560
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,090
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,670
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:28,110
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,470
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,200
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,790
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,240
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,710
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:49,380
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,930
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:56,440
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,070
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:03,480
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,120
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,530
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,020
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,950
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,760
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,250
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,830
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:28,240
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,870
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:34,440
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:38,850
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,980
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:47,190
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

[Eternal Love]

30
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:12,910
[Episode 14]

31
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,740
I like your eyes the most.

32
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:40,550
Winged Monarch, don't make fun of me.

33
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:46,840
Tell me. Where are you?

34
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,410
Am I not in your arms?

35
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:01,390
Did you go to look for Eldest Brother again?

36
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,580
What did you find?

37
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,070
I still don't have any clues.

38
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:11,870
Everyone, leave. I want to talk to the Princess.

39
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,080
- Yes.
- Yes.

40
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,020
It has been 70,000 years.

41
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,660
You should let go of what you ought to let go.

42
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:32,650
Father Monarch has already left me.

43
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,350
Eldest Brother's whereabouts are unknown, too.

44
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:41,290
If I let go, I will really have nothing at all.

45
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,630
You still have me.

46
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:48,180
Yes, I still have you.

47
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:52,950
Since young, you have always treated me the best.

48
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,130
You treat me even better than Father Monarch.

49
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:04,100
Second Brother, for the past few days, I have been thinking about when we were young.

50
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,970
The lively days between you, Eldest Brother and me.

51
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:10,910
If there wasn't a great war with the Heavenly Tribe,

52
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,440
Eldest Brother and you would definitely...

53
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,600
Don't talk about him to me.

54
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,140
Don't you miss Eldest Brother?

55
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:25,290
After all... After all, we are biological siblings.

56
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,290
Biological siblings?

57
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:33,560
You and he share the same mother.

58
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,600
However, I don't.

59
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,190
- Second Older Brother.
- Enough.

60
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,530
You are you and he is he.

61
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:45,740
Whatever relationship you have with him, it doesn't concern me.

62
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:51,380
In my life, you are my only sibling.

63
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,890
Yan Zhi, don't mention him to me again.

64
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:06,360
Could it be that the both of you will never reconcile?

65
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,520
Reconcile?

66
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,340
Enough, Second Older Brother, don't be angry.

67
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:23,030
It's just that I didn't imagine, in this huge Grand Purple Palace, only the two of us would be left.

68
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,630
By the way, Second Older Brother.

69
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,580
Look. I found this in the mortal realm.

70
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,590
This is the Kunlun Fan of Yuqing.

71
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,590
Isn't this Ah Yin's magical weapon?

72
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,770
Where did you find this?

73
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,460
Did you see her?

74
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,000
Listen to my explanation first.

75
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,290
Where did you find this exactly?

76
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,620
I didn't find him.

77
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,930
I met a mortal woman at Junji Mountain of the Eastern Wilderness in Zhongrong Empire.

78
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:55,030
She told me that she picked up this fan in Junji Mountain.

79
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:57,200
Junji Mountain?

80
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,590
Li Jing, have you been to Junji Mountain of the Eastern Wilderness?

81
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:05,090
When a few of my senior brothers and I go to the mortal realm to play, we always go there.

82
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,080
Junji Mountain?

83
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,150
Junji Mountain? Why didn't I think of this?

84
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,190
Second Older Brother, what did you say?

85
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:18,400
- I'm going to see Ah Yin.
- Second Older Brother!

86
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,740
Winged Monarch! Winged Monarch!

87
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,240
Winged Monarch, save me!

88
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:33,810
You didn't kneel when you saw me. You broke the rules of this palace. Even the Winged Monarch can't save you.

89
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,780
I just didn't see the Winged Monarchess.

90
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,590
- Shut up.
- Enough.

91
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:43,130
Didn't I tell you not to come to the Soup Pond if there's nothing important?

92
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,630
Why can't I come here?

93
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,590
You are the Winged Monarchess.

94
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,570
You need to remember your identity.

95
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,690
You should know that I'm the main consort.

96
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,600
How many times have you been to my palace in these 70,000 years?

97
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,750
As the main consort, I don't have a child.

98
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,800
How will the people of Winged Tribe see me?

99
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,850
Just leave the child to fate.

100
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,620
Mighty Monarch.

101
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,430
I have important work to do.

102
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,850
Stay in the palace. Watch yourself.

103
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:10,170
You are going to the mortal realm again?

104
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:18,150
Do I need to tell you what I'm going to do?

105
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,970
It has been 70,000 years.

106
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,250
Don't tell me you don't remember what happened at Kunlun Void...

107
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,410
Stop it.

108
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,720
Don't mention Kunlun Void to me.

109
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,240
Why can't I?

110
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,510
It has been 70,000 years. She has been missing for 70,000 years.

111
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:35,550
What does Si Yin have that I don't have?

112
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,160
Remember your identity.

113
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:21,690
Come take a look.

114
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:24,390
It's very fragrant.

115
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:36,610
Okay, fine.
[Gathering Teahouse]

116
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,260
It's said that hero, with its gold armor,

117
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,170
- was invincible with his silver spear skills.
- Good! Good!

118
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:48,990
At this time, three arrows were coming towards him.

119
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:53,630
This hero suddenly flipped his body and climbed up the ridge of the house.

120
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:56,140
- Good! Good!
- Good! Good!

121
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:02,770
In a split second, that hero shot up towards the peak of the clouds like a raccoon and disappeared in the middle of the night.

122
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:05,580
- Good! Good!
- Good! Good!

123
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,000
High God Mo Yuan?

124
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,440
I'm Ye Hua, the Crown Prince of Heavenly Tribe.

125
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,300
I am the Winged Monarch Li Jing. Greetings, Your Highness.

126
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,600
You are Li Jing, the Winged Monarch.

127
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,050
Your Highness, please forgive me for being impolite just now.

128
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:32,540
Crown Prince, Your Highness, you really resemble High God Mo Yuan.

129
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,920
No problem.

130
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:39,450
Do you know this is a forbidden place of Heavenly Tribes?

131
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,010
The Fiery Golden Lion brought disaster to the Zhongrong Empire for ten years.

132
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:49,200
After I killed it, this place has been marked a forbidden place by the Heavenly Tribes.

133
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,800
Your Highness, my apologies.

134
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,590
I didn't know about this and trespassed into the forbidden place.

135
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,220
Junji Mountain is inhabited.

136
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,170
You don't need to search anymore.

137
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,940
Your Highness, do you know why I'm here?

138
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:11,420
The Kunlun Fan of Yuqing you're holding belongs to Kunlun Void.

139
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,450
Is the person you are looking for High Immortal Si Yin?

140
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,830
Does Your Highness know where Si Yin is?

141
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:26,970
I only know that High Immortal Si Yin and High God Mo Yuan went into seclusion after the great war 70,000 years ago.

142
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,530
This matter is intricate and complicated.

143
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:35,290
I still don't believe it.

144
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,810
I'm taking my leave.

145
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,370
Wait.

146
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,930
Your Highness, what other instructions do you have?

147
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:51,050
The Kunlun Fan of Yuqing belongs to the Heavenly Tribes, so it should be returned to the Heavenly Tribes.

148
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,570
I'm taking my leave.

149
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:42,260
- What should we do?
- Okay. Okay. Let me do it.

150
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:54,790
There wasn't that much rice in the first place. I wasted it again.

151
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:58,790
It's okay. Once I have recovered from my injury,

152
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:01,270
I will think of a way to get food.

153
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:07,580
If you still don't recover from your injury, I'll starve to death with you soon.

154
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:55,260
Why am I... am I sleeping on the bed?

155
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,250
You would climb up here in the middle of the night when you are sleeping.

156
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:01,630
My body is seriously injured. Naturally, I couldn't stop you.

157
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:06,380
Then... I'm the only who wanted to hug you?

158
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,000
That's right.

159
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:11,190
- Then...
- Don't move.

160
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,650
Did I... touch your injury?

161
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,110
Are you asleep?

162
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,420
Your Young Highness.

163
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,560
Your Young Highness, what are you doing?

164
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,200
Trimming some peach blossoms to place in a vase.

165
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:22,460
How interesting. I heard High God Zhe Yan of Green Hill planted ten miles of peach blossoms.

166
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:26,770
Seems like you didn't have enough to appreciate and have come to Early Dawn Palace to trim the peach blossoms.

167
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:29,110
Stop making fun of me.

168
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:31,220
Since I've come to Early Dawn Palace,

169
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,690
I haven't even seen the Emperor

170
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:35,980
and I keep being summoned all over the place.

171
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:39,190
I have forgotten what I was here for.

172
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:41,090
The Emperor is in Early Dawn Palace.

173
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:43,080
It's just that he rarely goes out.

174
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:47,910
Why? Is he being excluded by the people in the Heavenly Palace?

175
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:50,360
Your Young Highness, you're so funny.

176
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:55,200
Do you know how the people from Heavenly Palace appraise the Emperor?

177
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,490
What do they think of him?

178
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,460
He is unconventional. He stays away from the mortal world.

179
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,990
He only cares about important matters of the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses.

180
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:06,370
He doesn't care about others. He is an immortal suitable for hanging on the wall only.

181
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:10,010
- Is he really like this?
- Absolutely.

182
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:14,470
Thus, whether you can repay his kindness or not is not a big deal.

183
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:18,570
This old Emperor doesn't mind about such minor matters.

184
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:22,220
Kindness must be repaid especially when it's about saving someone.

185
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,710
Whatever you like, Your Young Highness.

186
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,420
Why don't we do this?

187
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,890
If you want to repay the kindness, you need to see him.

188
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:36,080
Cut a few branches of peach blossoms for me to bring to Emperor, and sing praises to give you a chance to thank him.

189
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,780
What do you think?

190
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:45,620
But when Emperor sees me showing up here at Early Dawn Palace, wouldn't he blame me?

191
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:50,540
In order to repay the kindness, you have even stooped so low as to become a maidservant.

192
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,420
I think the Emperor will only be touched by you.

193
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,500
He wouldn't blame you.

194
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:00,180
That's right, too. Since young till now, I have never served others.

195
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:04,860
Moreover, this is for repaying his kindness. He will definitely forgive me.

196
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,740
Your Young Highness, pick the peach blossoms now.

197
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,450
You're the best, Star Monarch.

198
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,950
Which should I pick?

199
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,140
These peach blossoms are not bad.

200
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:39,180
They are nice.

201
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:43,470
These were picked by a new beautiful palace girl.

202
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,180
Palace girl?

203
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,490
- She's also new?
- What's wrong?

204
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:52,280
Third Highness, are you interested in meeting her?

205
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:57,260
- Yes.
- I will call her here.

206
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:22,970
Greetings, Emperor.

207
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,510
Greetings, Third Highness.

208
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,000
Stand up and let me see.

209
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,600
What do you want to see, Third Highness?

210
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,240
Third Highness is a well-known playboy in the Heavenly Tribe.

211
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,230
Of course, he wants to see your face.

212
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:58,310
Yes, I do want to look at your face.

213
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:02,910
And see if what Si Ming said is true that your face mesmerized him.

214
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,110
I didn't. I didn't say anything.

215
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:11,860
Isn't that true, Star Monarch Si Ming?

216
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:15,620
Ah... yes. You're right, Third Highness.

217
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,630
Greetings, Emperor.

218
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:30,030
Did you all plan to stage a play in my study?

219
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:35,630
What do you mean by that, Emperor? Do you understand?

220
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:37,650
I don't.

221
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:39,890
Do you understand, Third Highness?

222
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,680
I really didn't understand.

223
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:10,580
How come you're so timid?

224
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,920
When seeing Emperor, why aren't you acting like the empress of Green Hill?

225
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,160
Why are you being so docile?

226
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,050
It makes me so anxious!

227
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:23,370
That's all because you intervened and made things worse.

228
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:28,240
It was not easy for me to bring Her Young Highness in front of the Emperor.

229
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:34,050
You know her?

230
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:36,410
Yes.

231
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:39,090
You know her, too?

232
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,970
Yes.

233
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,090
Then, your real identity is...?

234
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:47,720
Bai Fengjiu of Green Hill.

235
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:53,100
So, you are the Young Highness from Green Hill.

236
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:58,110
In Emperor's palace, you're dressed like this because...?

237
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:00,690
Repaying kindness. To repay kindness to him.

238
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:03,770
Don't say anything. Let me guess.

239
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:06,200
Is it repaying him for saving your life?

240
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,830
Huh? How did Your Third Highness know?

241
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,780
From experiences.

242
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,940
Experience?

243
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,190
A few days ago, there was a person who had his eyes on a woman.

244
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,470
I taught him a lot of methods.

245
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:23,380
From a knight saving a damsel in distress to using the beauty trick.

246
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:27,850
At last, he chose to pretend to be saved to repay the kindness later.

247
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:32,520
About this repaying of kindness, especially a life savior, would take some time.

248
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:36,110
After several interactions, feelings will develop.

249
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:39,130
I see.

250
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,520
Third Highness, you're wise.

251
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:44,590
It's not like that.

252
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,390
I really came here to repay the kindness.

253
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,360
The Emperor really saved my life.

254
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,470
Your Highness doesn't understand.

255
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:52,360
The Emperor lived tens of thousands of years.

256
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:58,890
The women who used "repaying kindness" as an excuse to get close to him number up to 10,000.

257
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:02,930
But... But I'm really here to repay his kindness.

258
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:05,610
The Emperor really saved my life.

259
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:10,100
Emperor has one more famous trait which is he doesn't like to meddle in other people's business.

260
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:15,390
So, it's hard for me to believe that he saved your life.

261
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:18,430
Don't falsely accuse me, Third Highness.

262
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:20,570
I... I'm really here to repay his kindness.

263
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:24,390
- They all know about this. I really...
- Enough. Enough.

264
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,790
Okay then.

265
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,720
Let me ask you this.

266
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,110
Do you have any feelings for the Emperor?

267
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:48,000
Si Ming, how did you meet Her Young Highness? So interesting.

268
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,100
Emperor won't be able to clear his name now.

269
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:56,400
It's certainly out of good intentions, yet he instead invited a little peach blossom, who doesn't know what love is, to his side.

270
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:01,010
My fate with Her Young Highness has a long story.

271
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:06,470
But for Her Young Highness to get into the Early Dawn Palace, Cheng Yu helped her a lot.

272
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:11,250
Hey, you and she aren't related at all, so why did you get involved in this?

273
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,830
I saw injustice. Can't I?

274
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:18,200
Is that how you use that phrase?

275
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,730
I was moved by her earnest feelings, so I wanted to help her.

276
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,720
Can't I?

277
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,620
You can, as long as you are happy.

278
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:37,480
Si Ming, a man cannot annoy a woman from the past.

279
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,690
So long as there's love, even if your relationship has ended,

280
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:42,680
you need to yield to her forever.

281
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:46,840
Or else she will think you're scum.

282
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:51,050
Yes. Thank you for teaching me.

283
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,370
These are the last bits of rice.

284
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,610
Ye Hua.

285
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,930
Speak.

286
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,510
It's like this.

287
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:04,610
You see. I can live pretty well over here on this mountain.

288
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:13,810
I can take care of small animals, but taking care of a person like you is really difficult.

289
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:18,050
It took me half a month to pick enough fruits to trade for this rice.

290
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,910
Within a few days, it was gone.

291
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:24,020
Now, we really don't have any food.

292
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,420
Not having enough food is indeed a problem.

293
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,330
It's already deep autumn.

294
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:34,560
It will be hard to get through winter.

295
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:38,050
It's not about getting through winter.

296
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:40,060
What is it then?

297
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:51,030
I can see that the wound on your body has gotten better.

298
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:56,260
So, isn't it time for you to leave?

299
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,550
Do you want me to leave?

300
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:02,720
I... I didn't mean to drive you out.

301
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,730
It's just that... although I saved you, I cannot take care of you.

302
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:12,240
You saved me, so it's a given that I need to stay and repay you.

303
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,580
You... You don't need to repay me.

304
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:19,260
When I first saved you, I really didn't think you would repay me.

305
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:26,100
What you want and what I want to do are totally two different things.

306
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,760
I'm not an ungrateful person.

307
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,880
Whether you accept it or not, I have to repay this kindness.

308
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,800
But I'm not lacking in anything.

309
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,660
You can think carefully.

310
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:51,390
If you really want to repay me, let's devote to one another.

311
00:26:56,850 --> 00:27:02,190
Because I live in the mountains, I don't lack anything.

312
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:05,330
It's just no one can accompany me, it's quite lonely.

313
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:12,470
So if you really want to repay me, devote yourself to me and be my companion.

314
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:22,990
Of course, if you don't agree, that's understandable.

315
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:26,590
After all, I just rescued you and didn't do anything.

316
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:29,460
It doesn't really count as too great of a kindness.

317
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,320
All right.

318
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,350
All right?

319
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:37,460
I'll promise you.

320
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:43,250
To devote myself to you.

321
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:57,290
I thought you were going to think about it for a few days.

322
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:59,040
You agreed that quickly?

323
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:03,770
I... I didn't prepare anything.

324
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:05,920
What is there to prepare?

325
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:10,760
Since you've agreed to give yourself to me,

326
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:15,990
shouldn't we face the Great Lake of Eastern Wilderness and bow to Heaven and Earth,

327
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:22,190
make vows, become husband and wife, and never abandon each other?

328
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:28,740
Although I don't have any parents, if I skip this step, too,

329
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,330
isn't that not good?

330
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,970
You want to get married?

331
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,370
I want to get married.

332
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:44,230
I haven't bowed to Heaven and Earth with another human before.

333
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,840
Me, either.

334
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:52,210
Then, let's simplify everything.

335
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:54,430
The ceremonies aren't important.

336
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:56,750
Simplify everything?

337
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,770
Then, what should we do next?

338
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:09,920
Buy stuff.

339
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,970
Buy stuff?

340
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:21,190
Other than your red marriage blanket, we still need to add some more decoration to this house.

341
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,510
That isn't a marriage blanket.

342
00:29:56,730 --> 00:30:00,660
You clearly have the Crown Prince in your heart.

343
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:03,880
Why then did you personally ask to be a Heavenly Consort?

344
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,280
Moreover, Heavenly Monarch is already old.

345
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:10,020
He has long stopped favoring his harem.

346
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:14,940
Out of all heavenly consorts, you are the youngest.

347
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:18,070
Also, you are the one with the least power.

348
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:23,790
Look. The decree was made yesterday, and you have to move in all of a sudden today.

349
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:30,770
Other than your wedding dress, this palace... doesn't even have an atmosphere of a joyous celebration.

350
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,630
- You don't understand.
- What don't I understand?

351
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:37,940
I have been serving you since I was young.

352
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:43,710
Heavenly Monarch not having any time to favor his harem is exactly what I want.

353
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:46,910
Your Highness, you are perfectly well.

354
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:51,610
Do you want to guard a marriage without a husband by your side?

355
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:53,840
Isn't that perfect?

356
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:04,740
Your Highness.

357
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:12,590
Your Highness, can you tell me what you're thinking?

358
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:18,250
Although I'm at a low level, my heart is with you always.

359
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:24,410
If you can't tell me your thoughts, who can you tell?

360
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:27,700
You don't even have parents or siblings.

361
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:35,490
Look around and see what you need.

362
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,090
Hey, it's broad daylight!

363
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:44,800
I'm the son-in-law of the Heavenly Emperor!

364
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,570
Is this man crazy?

365
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:48,340
Let's go.

366
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,000
Looks like he's gone crazy.

367
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,020
[Gathering Teahouse]

368
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:55,480
- What illness could he have?
- Look at that man.

369
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:04,200
- Hey, say, do you all know why that Taoist priest became crazy?
- Stop looking. Stop looking.

370
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,960
- Why?
- I'll tell you.

371
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,120
This priest has a wife.

372
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,990
- I see.
- It can't be, can it?
- A few years ago, she wandered off.

373
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:15,050
- A few days ago, she suddenly returned and brought a child with her.
- Is that right?

374
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:17,710
When he brought the child to acknowledge his ancestors,

375
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:22,740
this child's biological father came, found the priest, and beat him up,

376
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:27,310
took the child away, and stole all of the banknotes that he saved.

377
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,980
This time, he really has gone crazy.

378
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:34,550
It's only been a few days. This is more brilliant than any dramas.

379
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,870
What happened? Do you know that priest?

380
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:40,690
He's an evil person.

381
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:42,310
Did he offend you?

382
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:45,320
He made it difficult for me twice.

383
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:49,830
Seems like he already got retribution, so there's no need to talk about him.

384
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:52,470
What else do you still need to buy?

385
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,010
Do you need anything else?

386
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:00,270
You've already sold your only jade pendant.

387
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,310
Yet we got so little in exchange.

388
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:05,330
Are you also going to sell your iron sword?

389
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:08,580
- Waiter, water!
- Okay!

390
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:13,960
I asked you to marry me, not for you to get me things.

391
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:17,670
But talking about this, Ye Hua,

392
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:22,210
I only have that thatched hut yet you married me.

393
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:26,260
Are you... not trying to trick me into marriage, right?

394
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,410
The person who asked me to use my body as payment is you.

395
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:32,650
Do you regret it now?

396
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:35,920
Don't worry, I won't complain.

397
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,390
But are you going to just marry me like this?

398
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:46,330
How are you going to explain to your family?

399
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:51,620
Or they are no longer around, either?

400
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:55,370
Let's talk about the future in the future.

401
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,870
Take a look.

402
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:08,250
- I want to buy this.
- Okay.

403
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:11,080
- And this too.
- Okay.

404
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:16,120
- Miss, hold this.
- Here.

405
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:21,250
Cheap and fresh, okay?

406
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:23,330
Ah Yin?

407
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:46,980
These clothes are so nice. We will wear them for only a day.

408
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,620
Isn't it wasteful?

409
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:56,340
If you like it, no one will care if you wore them for a year.

410
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:25,160
Ye Hua, after you get to know me more, what should we do if our personalities aren't compatible?

411
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:30,060
Is it too sudden for us to do this?

412
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,730
You didn't take me to meet your parents.

413
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:37,610
If your parents know that you got married outside,

414
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:40,180
will they be unhappy?

415
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,560
Also, I forgot to ask you.

416
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,760
Do you have a prior marriage engagement?

417
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:02,310
In the city, men around your age are all married and have children.

418
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:06,700
Do you... have a prior wedding engagement?

419
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:15,760
Su Su, my family condition is very difficult.

420
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,190
It's hard to explain in a few words,

421
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:26,180
but you must remember that starting from today, you are my wife.

422
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:30,550
Since I have married you, I will then never break your heart.

423
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:40,070
Okay, I trust you.

424
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:55,690
This should be uncovered by your husband.

425
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:58,200
I don't know what to say.

426
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:04,220
Just follow what I say.

427
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:13,520
I'm feeling a bit flustered.

428
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,530
It's okay.

429
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:21,190
It's only kneeling before Heaven and Earth.

430
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:24,250
Okay, let's do it.

431
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:39,980
I, Ye Hua, in this Great Lake of the Eastern Wilderness

432
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:42,810
ask all the gods of the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses to be my witness.

433
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:46,390
Starting today, Su Su and I are going to be a married couple.

434
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:49,760
For all eternity, we will treat each other wholeheartedly.

435
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,460
No matter if it's during a disaster or good fortune, we will never leave each other.

436
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:56,900
I, Su Su, in this Great Lake of the Eastern Wilderness today,

437
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:00,400
ask all the gods of the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses to be my witness.

438
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,110
Ye Hua and I are going to be a married couple.

439
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:05,880
For all eternity, we will treat each other wholeheartedly.

440
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,460
No matter if during a disaster or good fortune, we will never leave each other.

441
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:52,770
Since we are now husband and wife, I need to say some things beforehand.

442
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:56,480
Say it.

443
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,490
We've made a vow to the Great Lake of Eastern Wilderness,

444
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:02,870
that we're going to be a married couple for all eternity.

445
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:06,410
You then can't be unfaithful to me for all eternity.

446
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:10,420
I'm a person who separates love and hate very clearly.

447
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:12,920
I can't allow any flaws.

448
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,960
If you break my heart...

449
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,120
What will you do?

450
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:22,570
If you break my heart, those vows will be voided.

451
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:25,550
I will abandon you and never see you again.

452
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,840
If I break your heart, you'll abandon me.

453
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,710
Aren't you then granting me my wish?

454
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:36,230
I'm not kidding with you!

455
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:52,460
Su Su, close your eyes.

00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:49,680
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

472
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:55,110
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

473
00:42:56,990 --> 00:43:01,910
♫ All are just illusions ♫

474
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:08,660
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

475
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:13,870
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

476
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:18,360
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

477
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:24,530
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

478
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:29,910
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

479
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:35,130
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

480
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:37,970
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

481
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:46,590
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from my previous life ♫

482
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:59,100
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

483
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:04,590
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

484
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:08,960
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

485
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:15,290
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

486
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:20,450
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

487
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:25,830
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

488
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:28,480
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

489
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:37,880
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

490
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:50,400
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
