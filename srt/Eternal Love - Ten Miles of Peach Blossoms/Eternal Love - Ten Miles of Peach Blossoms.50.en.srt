”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

2
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:17,560
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,160
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,610
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:28,100
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,480
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,220
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,800
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,220
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:46,040
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,570
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:52,990
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:56,390
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,070
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:03,630
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:07,090
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:10,550
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:14,090
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,990
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,900
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,230
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:24,800
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,030
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,990
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:34,570
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:38,940
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:42,080
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,770
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,870
[Episode 50]

31
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:19,340
In any case, before you comply with the tribulation, I won't leave you.

32
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,800
Who told you I was going to comply with a tribulation?

33
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,990
Are you not?

34
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,920
Look at me.

35
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,270
Do I look like someone who's going to die?

36
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:40,160
You... You don't look like one.

37
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,350
I don't care. It doesn't matter who told me.

38
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,130
In any case, you are going to comply with the tribulation.

39
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:48,550
No matter what, before you go, I won't leave you.

40
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,100
I will keep watch over you.

41
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,470
I won't waste my time on others.

42
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,890
I'll make whatever you want to eat.

43
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:01,320
I'll go wherever you want to go.

44
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,940
Your father is here.

45
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,660
Who cares if he's here?

46
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,970
I won't listen to anyone.

47
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,410
Emperor Dong Hua.

48
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:21,080
High God Bai Yi, why are you suddenly in Nine Heavens?

49
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,710
It's regarding my younger sister's wedding.

50
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:30,420
Yes. The wedding between the Heavenly Tribe and the Nine-Tailed Fox Tribe is an important matter.

51
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,340
I won't delay your time.

52
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,200
I'm taking my leave.

53
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:47,540
- Father.
- Do you still remember you have a father?

54
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,120
Father,

55
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,140
I don't care how you hit me.

56
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,690
I will still stay with Emperor in Nine Heavens.

57
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,690
You really can't give him up?

58
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,690
I can't.

59
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:38,880
Are you thinking of the scenery in the mountain when I brought you there when you were young?

60
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:49,850
Of the 20,000 years when I was learning at Kunlun Void,

61
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:52,030
Kunlun Void has always been low profile.

62
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:55,710
But after 70,000 years, it has become so high profile.

63
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,950
They must be admiring Kunlun Void's style.

64
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:01,900
When they heard that High God Mo Yuan was back, they specially came here to pay homage.

65
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,070
Kunlun Mountain is a divine mountain that rose up from a dragon bone.

66
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,510
Perhaps, when it became aware that Mo Yuan was coming back,

67
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,750
it got excited and used its dragon energy to welcome him back.

68
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,470
Thus, it attracts all these minor immortals here.

69
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:18,770
In order to not disturb these immortals who are here to watch the fun, it's better that we conceal ourselves.

70
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,480
Fine.

71
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:27,040
- High God Mo Yuan!
- What? High God Mo Yuan!

72
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:31,050
The leader just now was High God Mo Yuan.

73
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:37,510
Welcome back, High God Mo Yuan, to Kunlun Void.

74
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:50,840
Welcome, Teacher.

75
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:56,740
I kept you all waiting for a long time.

76
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:07,430
- Teacher!
- Teacher!

77
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,740
Zi Lan sent us a message days ago that the dragon energy in Kunlun Void had greatly increased and the bells were ringing nonstop.

78
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:19,470
Although we didn't know what the signs were, we all rushed here overnight.

79
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:22,670
Although we didn't know when you would be back,

80
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:27,350
we knew very well that you would return to Kunlun Void.

81
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:32,420
Subsequently, I found out that you borrowed my oldest brother's body to maintain your spirit.

82
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:36,930
Although he consumed the medicinal pill, I thought it would take at least three months.

83
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:42,940
Today, when we sensed your divine aura outside the gates, we rushed here,

84
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:47,450
but we didn't arrive in time to welcome you at the gates of the temple.

85
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,700
Teacher,

86
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,270
you were gone for 70,000 years.

87
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:55,110
You're finally back.

88
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,090
You may all stand.

89
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,890
Stand up.

90
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,330
Teacher, I have something to report.

91
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:51,160
Ever since you were gone, Seventeenth disappeared for no reason as well.

92
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:56,230
We've been looking for him these years, but we haven't had any luck.

93
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:59,630
I fear little junior brother is fraught with grim possibilities.

94
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,800
I'm not.

95
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,910
Senior Brothers, I am Si Yin.

96
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:17,300
- Si Yin?
- Si Yin?

97
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,110
- Si Yin?
- Teacher.
This?

98
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,310
Teacher.

99
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:42,750
Seventeenth?!

100
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,640
Teacher,

101
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,220
- I was the one who drugged my seniors back then.
- What?

102
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,840
- Then, I took your body overnight and left Kunlun Void.
- This...

103
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,380
I shouldn't have kept it a secret from you.

104
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:12,700
But Sixteenth Senior Brother didn't bring it up earlier probably because he wanted to protect me.

105
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,350
- This...
- What?

106
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,620
Seventeenth! Seventeenth!

107
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:31,020
Tenth Senior said that just to hide from us, Si Yin must have changed his name.

108
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,150
We've been searching all over for you.

109
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,790
We couldn't find you anywhere.

110
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,570
We knew you were hiding from us.

111
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:50,220
We didn't know... you would pretend to be a female just to hide from us?!

112
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,490
This...

113
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,970
Senior Brother Zi Lan,

114
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:01,200
do you really think I look like a man pretending to be a female?

115
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,000
You have never bathed with us.

116
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,640
So, this was the reason.

117
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,480
Turns out you were female.

118
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:14,320
That's right. That's right. She is... a woman.

119
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,520
I was afraid you didn't want to admit it.

120
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,270
I realized when you came in female clothing.

121
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:24,220
I just didn't want to expose you.

122
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,920
What?! You knew it already, Eldest Senior Brother?

123
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,270
So, you were hiding there and watching the show?

124
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,910
I wouldn't dare to. I wouldn't.

125
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:35,080
Seventeenth is High Goddess Bai Qian of Green Hill now.

126
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,380
Within Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses, we must respectfully call her Great Lady.

127
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:41,570
In terms of rank, I should greet her first.

128
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:46,420
Hence, Sixteenth, how could I dare give the final conclusion for Seventeenth?

129
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:50,140
If she doesn't say so, how would I dare?

130
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,960
With Teacher here,

131
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:04,000
I will always be Kunlun Void's Si Yin and everyone's Little Seventeenth.

132
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,650
- Seventeenth!
- Come!

133
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:10,430
- Come! Come!
- Seventeenth, you're so pretty. I never knew.

134
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:14,760
- All those years, I really couldn't tell you were a girl.
- That's right.

135
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,560
- I really couldn't tell.
- Me, either.

136
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,470
I missed you so much.

137
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,270
That's right.

138
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,780
- I miss you all so much.
 - Yes.

139
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,890
I thought it would take Teacher three months to wake up.

140
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,840
I didn't expect him to wake up in such a short time.

141
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,320
This is really unbelievable.

142
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,610
It's not a waste for Ye Hua to lose all his cultivation to help Mo Yuan wake up so soon.

143
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:45,360
Ye Hua is a very affectionate person.

144
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,410
But, Young Fifth, your luck is really bad.

145
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:51,660
You just repaid your debt to Mo Yuan, and now you owe Ye Hua.

146
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,810
You paid back Mo Yuan by giving him the blood from your heart for 70,000 years.

147
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:59,570
How will you repay Ye Hua for his 40,000 years of cultivation?

148
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:04,300
I think Ye Hua and I will eventually be married.

149
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,240
A married couple should get to know and love each other.

150
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,280
Who owes who doesn't have to be separated so clearly.

151
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,680
Fourth Older Brother, what do you think?

152
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,910
I'm going back to my room first.

153
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,230
I brought some peach blossom wine here. Want to try it?

154
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:05,310
Fine.

155
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,710
Why did you answer so quickly today?

156
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:10,720
In the past, you almost never drank.

157
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,550
I have many questions to ask you.

158
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:17,440
If we don't talk while drinking, won't it be quite lonely?

159
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:25,220
Why did Seventeenth take my body to Green Hill?

160
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:36,750
I knew you were going to ask this.

161
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:41,820
Mo Yuan, you must think carefully about what you want to ask.

162
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:45,950
After you woke up, I can see that your heart hasn't been calm.

163
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,920
After I tell you everything, I fear that you will be even more uncertain

164
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,390
if your relationship with Bai Qian is that of a teacher disciple, or as a woman and man.

165
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,480
Just tell me.

166
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,620
I would like to hear about it.

167
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,300
When your spirit shattered,

168
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:12,410
Seventeenth held your body and sat on the bank of the Ruoshui River.

169
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:15,660
No one could go near her as if she had gone crazy.

170
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,570
She insisted that the Winged Tribe died with you.

171
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,740
Seventeenth, are you asleep?

172
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,550
I'm already asleep.

173
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,840
You could even talk when you are asleep?

174
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,150
I'm coming in.

175
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,350
It's been so long since Kunlun Void has had this many people. The guest rooms are full.

176
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,540
My room is occupied by several seniors.

177
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,780
I will make do with your place tonight.

178
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,550
I will tidy up the new guest room tomorrow.

179
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,600
Seventeenth,

180
00:14:54,430 --> 00:15:00,680
you've worked hard taking care of Teacher for these 70,000 years.

181
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:09,040
In the past, when my sixteenth senior brother talked to me, he would always provoke me.

182
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,030
If I say east, he would definitely say west.

183
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:13,970
If I say it's okay, he would definitely say it wasn't.

184
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:18,210
The words you said today... Are you really my sixteenth senior?

185
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,360
Are you Zi Lan?

186
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:25,180
You deserve not being able to get a husband all these years.

187
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,320
You really are Zi Lan.

188
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,460
And you deserve not being able to get a wife for so long.

189
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:38,860
By the way, guess what I was just thinking about.

190
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,930
What?

191
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,420
I was just thinking.

192
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:50,260
Although I have lived until this age and experienced different kinds of regrets,

193
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:54,270
after lying down in this small bed in Kunlun Void,

194
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:58,720
I realized that the past regrets are not regrets anymore.

195
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:05,460
That's right. After living for so long, you're able to move on from many things.

196
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:11,350
Do you still remember Yan Zhi?

197
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:18,010
The princess from the Winged Realm?

198
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:24,230
After the battle at Ruoshui, I had never seen her again.

199
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:28,360
I remember she's kind and likable.

200
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,550
That's right.

201
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,940
She's very likable.

202
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,550
Have you met her?

203
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:41,680
I met her a few times in the Mortal Realm when I was looking for you.

204
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:46,520
From your voice, it seems like you're in love.

205
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,650
Let's talk about it.

206
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,040
It's getting late.

207
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,110
Let's go to sleep.

208
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,380
You are going to sleep now when we are having a serious talk?

209
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,430
Don't want to talk anymore?

210
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,210
I really want to chat with Ye Hua like this,

211
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:13,340
but he probably wouldn't understand what I'm saying.

212
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:17,400
At this time, he's probably a year old now.

213
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,010
What does he look like when he's a year old?

214
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:23,950
I wonder if he looks like Mochi.

215
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:37,620
It's here.

216
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:41,050
She got the blood from her heart for you.

217
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:46,580
Then, she poured it into a bowl and carefully and slowly fed it to you.

218
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:50,500
It's fine if doing so was certainly able to revive you,

219
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,580
but she didn't know if you would really be able to return.

220
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:58,410
She merely wanted to preserve your divine body.

221
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:07,180
She used her Nine-Tailed Fox's blood of Green Hill to preserve your divine body that was already without a spirit.

222
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:36,830
Emperor.

223
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:39,210
Who hurt you?

224
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:43,580
My father said that since I lost my chastity to you in the Mortal Realm,

225
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,370
he'll beat me to death.

226
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:49,390
I finally escaped just to see you.

227
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:53,530
Then, out of filial piety, I let him beat me.

228
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:55,500
Emperor.

229
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:59,060
Your injuries look real.

230
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,430
You almost fooled me.

231
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:03,960
Your acting wasn't complete.

232
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:09,250
When I touched your wound, you should have avoided it and said that it hurts.

233
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,690
It hurts.

234
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:14,450
Act more realistic.

235
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,420
I was wrong.

236
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,920
These injuries are fake.

237
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:26,820
Who taught you this?

238
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,500
Cheng Yu.

239
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:44,680
His Third Highness's confidante doesn't know anything except how to deceive people.

240
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,840
I begged her to teach me.

241
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,590
It's my fault.

242
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,820
Don't blame her.

243
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,970
Little fox, in that small run-down house in the Mortal Realm, I already told you.

244
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:05,300
When you are hesitant to cut off a relationship, you will only hurt yourself.

245
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,270
Do you still not understand?

246
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:10,260
The debt you owe me is over.

247
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:14,160
Why are you here again today at Early Dawn Palace?

248
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:19,810
Because you are complying with the tribulation soon, I want to be with you.

249
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:22,900
Who told you I'm doing that?

250
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,940
I can't tell you.

251
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:33,520
Do you know how much older I am than you?

252
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,210
Before your father was born,

253
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,610
I was already like this.

254
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:42,560
In hundreds of thousands of years, great changes were seen in the course of time,

255
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,620
many lives were born and gone back to ashes.

256
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,610
You have never seen that.

257
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:52,530
You didn't see when my hands were stained with blood and mechanical in killing, either.

258
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:58,490
Who is the one you love?

259
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,470
Is he the person you see right now?

260
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,530
But Fengjiu, the person standing in front of you, is not the real me.

261
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:11,220
That person teasing you in Early Dawn Palace is not the real me, either.

262
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:15,270
That person in the Mortal Realm who lived with you also wasn't me.

263
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:20,820
This person in front of you isn't only the ruler of both Heaven and Earth that made all the heavenly laws.

264
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,490
I don't have any emotions or desires, either.

265
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,050
I don't know what the mundane world is.

266
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:27,230
No matter what you do, in my eyes, they are all like child's play.

267
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:30,310
That's me, Emperor Dong Hua, the Shaoyang Monarch of the Purple Manor.

268
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,150
- But...
- There's no buts.

269
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,500
You should go.

270
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,910
Leave now.

271
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:54,180
- You let the emperor scare you this way?
- Yes

272
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,220
He already saw through my fake wounds.

273
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,820
Would I still have the face to stay?

274
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:04,210
What did Emperor experience in the past?

275
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:06,370
Si Ming, tell her.

276
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:11,160
It's said that when Heavenly Monarch was still in diapers, Emperor had fought war after war,

277
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,750
leading the different gods under him to pacify the Four Seas.

278
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:19,670
Of course, I know about these from historical records.

279
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:22,420
Emperor is already so old.

280
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,470
No wonder, he must comply with the tribulations.

281
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:27,910
Tribulation? Emperor is going to comply with a tribulation?

282
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:31,940
Isn't that so?

283
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,760
You are with him every day and you don't even know?

284
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,800
Of course, I know.

285
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,530
He wouldn't comply with a tribulation at this time.

286
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:41,450
You should know that complying with a tribulation is very important.

287
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:44,090
Emperor used to be the ruler of Heaven and Earth. If he complies with a tribulation,

288
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:46,440
the whole Nine Heavens will already be mourning and this news would have spread all over the Four Seas.

289
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:50,170
How could he be quiet about this and let the both of you know?

290
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:53,530
Then, he's not complying with a tribulation?

291
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:58,350
Of course not. Furthermore, I can guarantee that he can live for another hundreds of thousands of years without any problems.

292
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,900
He will even live longer than you.

293
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:06,250
Don't forget that, he's the only immortal in this world who was born from a rock.

294
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,050
He won't die so easily.

295
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:13,160
Who exactly told you that Emperor was complying with a tribulation?

296
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,760
Cheng Yu told me.

297
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,300
Huh?

298
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:26,980
That day, I unintentionally overheard... the Lord of Lingbao and Emperor talking about whatever tribulation.

299
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,580
I thought Emperor was going to comply with a tribulation.

300
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:33,480
I was wondering why Young Highness came here today with a frown on her face.

301
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,250
Why didn't you ask me instead?

302
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:38,630
I'm the immortal who has been with the Emperor for the longest time.

303
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:46,540
If he doesn't need to go,

304
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:50,490
what I did that day was really embarrassing.

305
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:55,760
If my father knew, he'd beat me to death.

306
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:20,520
Emperor Dong Hua, I wonder if you have the leisurely time to discuss my unworthy daughter, Bai Fengjiu?

307
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,030
Please have a seat.

308
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:36,660
What would you like to talk about?

309
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:41,310
I will get to the point.

310
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,300
Since you and my daughter were married in the Mortal Realm,

311
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:51,260
could you grant her a marriage with you?

312
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:59,550
Although I always lecture her not to follow you around and lose face for Green Hill,

313
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:02,480
as her father,

314
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,150
I can see she's set on being with you.

315
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:13,240
So, I'm here today as her father to propose marriage on her behalf.

316
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,960
Please consider this marriage.

317
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,940
Since you are serious about this, I will be direct.

318
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:25,060
Your daughter and I have no fate.

319
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:42,020
I'll take my leave.

320
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,950
You can come out.

321
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,930
Emperor.

322
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:15,350
What troubles are you trying to create again?

323
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:19,370
I merely heard from someone that you wouldn't be living for long,

324
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:22,460
so I wanted to walk your remaining life with you.

325
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:27,960
Even if I don't have long to live, what status are you going to use to keep me company?

326
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,240
- In the past Mortal Realm, we were...
- It doesn't count.

327
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,020
It counts! In my heart, you were once my husband.

328
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,470
That's just in your heart.

329
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:44,510
Fengjiu, how many times do I have to say it?

330
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:48,870
You were only going through the tribulation with me in the Mortal Realm.

331
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:51,770
Don't place any hopes in me.

332
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:53,780
It's useless.

333
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,090
There's no fate between us.

334
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:01,690
That's not possible. That's not possible.

335
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:05,540
Dong Hua, if you didn't have me in your heart.

336
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,210
why did you go to that rundown hut?

337
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,980
You can't let go of me.

338
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:12,370
If you can't let go, so why can't we try this?

339
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:15,710
- When we were in the Mortal Realm...
- That's enough!

340
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,830
Why?

341
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:10,520
Why do you have to be so cruel to me?

342
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:14,260
I'm cruel to everyone.

343
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,430
Not like this.

344
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:18,710
It shouldn't be like this.

345
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,740
Do you have any predicaments?

346
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,050
Tell me. Okay?

347
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:28,930
Do you know why your father came to see me just now?

348
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:35,650
He begged me to marry you.

349
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:42,230
My father begged you to marry me?

350
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,930
That's right.

351
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:48,760
My father begged you?

352
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,640
And you still don't want to?

353
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,540
That's right.

354
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:00,240
It's my fault.

355
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,070
Everything's my fault.

356
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:07,090
My father's never begged anyone before.

357
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:10,000
He's never.

358
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,250
I shouldn't be like this.

359
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,550
I shouldn't lose face for Green Hill.

360
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:18,170
I keep losing face for Green Hill.

361
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:23,150
I shouldn't cling onto you, Emperor Dong Hua.

362
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,070
Father.

363
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:05,340
You know that you have embarrassed others?

364
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,440
All right.

365
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,430
Let's go.

366
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:08,160
Why're you looking at me?

367
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,620
Young Highness left early this morning.

368
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:18,650
Do you not have any questions?

369
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:23,510
If you have something to say, say it or don't say anything at all.

370
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:30,260
You were once the ruler of Heaven and Earth.

371
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:35,790
Although, there was peace later in Four Seas and you handed over your position to the former Heavenly Monarch,

372
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:37,710
and again, handed it over to the current Heavenly Monarch...

373
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:39,980
Get to the point.

374
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,900
I think...

375
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:49,860
Her Young Highness came to Heavenly Palace just to repay her debt of gratitude

376
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,410
and was willing to go to the Mortal Realm as a consort.

377
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:55,760
As such, she didn't receive any feelings from you.

378
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,590
As a bystander,

379
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:01,470
I think it's unfair for Her Young Highness.

380
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,050
Si Ming,

381
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:09,290
have you ever separated a fated couple in the Book of Fate?

382
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:12,080
Of course.

383
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:19,540
Then, if it's clearly written in your Book of Fate that these two people have no fate,

384
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:22,710
do they still have a chance to be together?

385
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:29,270
I have to write the change myself, or it'll be impossible.

386
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:44,040
What if the Three Lives Stone has predestined the two aren't fated?

387
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,180
Three Lives Stone?

388
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,820
Mighty Monarch, in just a few days,

389
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:10,420
the rumor has spread quickly to the sub-tribes.

390
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:15,230
They are saying that the former Winged Monarch is coming back soon to punish a non-filial son like you.

391
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:18,820
Those chieftains who supported you are having a big headache.

392
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:22,170
After all, the current Winged Realm is not as good as before.

393
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:25,820
Everyone desires to go back to that spectacular glory in the past.

394
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:29,480
Mighty Monarch, if we don't think of a solution, I fear a disaster will occur.

395
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,690
The loyal generals died under the hands of High Goddess Bai Qian.

396
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:36,540
Those who remain are from the former Winged Monarch's old divisions.

397
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:39,450
When they found out about this information, they are ready to take action.

398
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:42,710
Some are monitoring the situation before they make any decisions.

399
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:46,230
Before we came, we visited a few colleagues.

400
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:48,080
They closed the doors and refused to see us.

401
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,960
In the end, only the two of us are here.

402
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:00,550
If we can really go back to the past,

403
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:03,080
I would be most willing.

404
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:08,450
But we can't wait until the former Winged Monarch comes back.

405
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:13,920
With his disposition, he doesn't care about the people at all.

406
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,950
Once he leaves the Donghuang Bell,

407
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:25,260
I'm very sure that he will use this kingdom to take revenge for him

408
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:27,980
for being sealed in the Donghuang Bell for 70,000 years.

409
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:30,040
I agree with you.

410
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:33,160
Hence, even if I die, I will not support the former Winged Monarch.

411
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:36,480
- I vow to follow Mighty Monarch till death.
- I vow to follow Mighty Monarch till death.

412
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:42,900
Who knew in the end only you two would stand by me?

413
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:49,500
Perhaps, I need to perform a great task in Grand Purple Palace

414
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:54,270
to protect the peace in the Winged Realm, or even the entire world.

415
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:01,420
Go and transfer the most trusted soldiers here to protect Grand Purple Palace.

416
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,450
Yes.

417
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,110
Second Older Brother.

418
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:20,160
Am I really incapable?

419
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,470
No, you're not.

420
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:27,500
The time before that great battle 70,000 years ago was the most glorious period for the Winged Realm.

421
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,240
Everyone misses it.

422
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,980
Some might even wish to return to that spectacular period.

423
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:34,910
That's why they are putting their resentments on you.

424
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:41,330
But that great battle depleted the financial resources and manpower of the Winged Realm.

425
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:46,670
It was you who gradually brought it back again to the current Winged Realm now.

426
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:49,220
If it was another Winged Monarch,

427
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,940
he wouldn't have done a better job than you.

428
00:35:55,810 --> 00:36:00,570
Whatever you want to do, I will definitely help you.

429
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:05,500
I'm going to the Heavenly Palace to meet His Highness the Crown Prince first.

430
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:08,270
Crown Prince Ye Hua?

431
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:11,260
That's right.

432
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:18,790
[Pure Wutong Palace]

433
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:33,120
Winged Monarch.

434
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:38,610
I'm here to seek an audience with His Highness the Crown Prince.

435
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:43,090
He won't be in the Heavenly Palace for two months.

436
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:45,720
- He's not here?
- Yes.

437
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,860
Do you know where he went?

438
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:52,690
About this... I can't tell you.

439
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:00,260
Is something celebratory happening at Pure Wutong Palace?

440
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:03,360
Yes. Heavenly Monarch has arranged to meet the Fox Emperor.

441
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:07,920
I estimate that in a few months, you will receive the wedding invitation from Pure Wutong Palace.

442
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:14,400
Are you referring to His Highness the Crown Prince and Ah Yin?

443
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:19,590
No, I should say, High Goddess Bai Qian.

444
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,240
That's right.

445
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,310
I will offer my congratulations first.

446
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:29,070
I'm taking my leave.

447
00:37:55,790 --> 00:38:00,080
Teacher, you have been tired for a long time. I brewed new tea for you.

448
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:25,570
It has already been ten days.

449
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:27,660
Why are there still so many guests?

450
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,190
Teacher's return is an important event.

451
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:30,940
I wonder how the news spread.

452
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:33,100
Those that fly in the sky, those that crawl on the ground,

453
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,760
any creature with some spiritual roots,

454
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:38,480
all know now that the high god who had been the war commander since ancient times has returned.

455
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,010
This is what the rumor says.

456
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:44,300
Teacher wore a purple crown, black armor, rode a horse,

457
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:47,080
wore boots in black leather and wielded the Xuanyuan Sword.

458
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,740
He even carried a delicate, cute and young lady in his arms.

459
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,850
At the third quarter of wei hour (1-3 pm) of August 16th,

460
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:55,040
he majestically landed on top of the mountain of Kunlun Void.

461
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,380
When Teacher landed on the top of the mountain in Kunlun Void,

462
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:01,430
the long mountain range which Kunlun Void is part of shook three times.

463
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:03,510
The birds and beasts were screaming.

464
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:08,350
Even the Arowana fish in the water swam out and cried tears of joy.

465
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:11,230
This rumor is not reliable at all.

466
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:13,490
It's not too unreliable, either.

467
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:16,290
Purple crown, riding on a horse, black leather boots, and Xuanyuan Sword.

468
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:19,080
This is what Mo Yuan usually wears on expeditions.

469
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:24,690
For 70,000 years, he was always in the main hall of Kunlun Void, being revered by the disciples.

470
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:29,720
As for that delicate and cute young lady, it must be talking about you. Right?

471
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:37,720
I can accept being called cute and young, but "delicate" is not accurate.

472
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,660
Seventeenth, at your current age,

473
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:44,710
don't even talk about your in-laws, shouldn't you have some children by now. Right?

474
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:48,110
When will you let us meet your husband?

475
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:52,800
With your looks and character, I wonder what kind of husband you will marry.

476
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,060
Easy! In two months is my wedding.

477
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,330
I will invite you all.

478
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:04,910
Grand Teacher, there's another guest here to pay homage to you.

479
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:09,920
I'm leaving.

480
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:18,170
Hey.

481
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:22,180
He has been receiving guests for many days.

482
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,470
He should rest.

483
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:26,010
Teacher is leaving just like this?

484
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:27,600
There will be more people coming later to pay homage.

485
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,290
What should we do?

486
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:31,400
Just send them to the main hall for tea.

487
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,470
After they are done drinking, just send them off.

488
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:37,550
Do we have enough tea leaves?

489
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,220
We do.

490
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:44,760
Teacher is behaving strangely.

491
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:53,420
In the past, your fourth older brother and I often discussed your marriage.

492
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:56,220
We feel that you speak without engaging your brain first.

493
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,690
While you're good at being an immortal,

494
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:02,560
when it comes to small talk or romance, you are an amateur.

495
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,490
Fourth Older Brother told me this, too.

496
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:08,580
It's exactly the same.

497
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:12,500
You really talk without engaging your brain.

498
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:15,210
Talk without engaging your brain.

499
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:36,100
This place is very clean.

500
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,990
Of course, it's clean.

501
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:41,140
Kunlun Void has been empty for several hundreds of thousands of years,

502
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:43,520
but the Pellet-Cultivating Furnace has never been idle.

503
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,400
Why?

504
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:49,110
Didn't your future husband tell you?

505
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:51,750
Ye Hua?

506
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:53,840
He never mentioned this.

507
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:58,480
That night, His Highness the Crown Prince was bleeding and even lost an arm.

508
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,550
Honestly speaking, he scared me.

509
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:02,920
I thought he was injured and wanted to recuperate here.

510
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,510
I didn't expect that he was here to refine a medicinal pill.

511
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:08,130
Who do you think he did it for?

512
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:10,000
Why did he come to Kunlun Void?

513
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,420
Why didn't he use the Pellet-Cultivating Furnace in Nine Heavens?

514
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:23,650
He left Nine Heavens probably because he didn't want people to know that he was refining a pill.

515
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:31,200
He refined the medicinal pill for me.

516
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,870
So it was for you.

517
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:35,070
His Highness the Crown Prince treats you so well.

518
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:37,920
All right. Go back to work. I'm going to prepare dinner for everyone.

519
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,740
All right.

520
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:45,180
He has been bearing everything for me.

521
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:47,820
Whether it's the Mythical Mushrooms or his lifetime cultivation,

522
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:52,130
it was for me to return my debt of gratitude to Mo Yuan.

523
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:54,080
As for him...

524
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:27,880
”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

525
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:30,000
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

526
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,660
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

527
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:37,940
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

528
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:47,190
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

529
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,250
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

530
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:56,630
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

531
00:43:56,630 --> 00:44:02,170
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

532
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:09,110
♫ All are just illusions ♫

533
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:15,590
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

534
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:20,690
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

535
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:25,230
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

536
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:31,360
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

537
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:36,820
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

538
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:42,000
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

539
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,960
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

540
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:53,900
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from
my previous life ♫

541
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:06,030
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

542
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:11,550
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

543
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:15,920
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

544
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:22,110
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

545
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:27,420
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

546
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:32,780
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

547
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:35,540
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

548
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:44,700
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

549
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:57,040
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
