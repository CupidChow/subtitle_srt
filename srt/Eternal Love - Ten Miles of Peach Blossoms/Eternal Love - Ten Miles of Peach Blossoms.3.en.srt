”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,550
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,160
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,660
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,870
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,420
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,210
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,790
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,210
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,920
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,400
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,960
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,460
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,070
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:03,560
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,090
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:10,530
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,120
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,960
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,780
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,240
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,750
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,020
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,820
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,550
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:38,940
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:42,000
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,750
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

[Eternal Love]

30
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:13,020
[Episode 3]

31
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,370
- Everyone, leave.
- Yes.

32
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,750
Awake now?

33
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,900
Do you know how long you have slept?

34
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,330
A full ten days and an hour.

35
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,250
I've slept for ten days?

36
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,000
That's right.

37
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,190
Leave now.

38
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,960
Rascal, you drank all the fine wines in my palace.

39
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:00,610
Fortunately, I was there with you to feed you the Grand Purple Palace's unique chaser.

40
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:04,460
If not, the consequences would have been unimaginable.

41
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:08,410
How has my Ninth Senior Brother been doing these past ten days I've been asleep?

42
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,280
He... ran into three pillars,

43
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,660
cut his wrists twice,

44
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,230
seems to also have thrown himself into the lake twice.

45
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,770
I heard he's now on a hunger strike.

46
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,600
What did you say?

47
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,830
What's so bad about my father?

48
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,470
He's the Winged Monarch of the Four Seas and Eight Wilderness.

49
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,170
Why does your senior brother refuse to accept him?

50
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:39,020
Of course, acknowledging a person as a godfather is not child's play.

51
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,710
Can you take me to go see my Ninth Senior Brother?

52
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,720
What's the hurry? Let me finish talking.

53
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,910
The godfather celebration ceremony has been set for the third day of next month.

54
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:56,440
Whether your Ninth Senior Brother agrees or not, the invitations have been sent out.

55
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,720
- Godfather celebration ceremony?
- Yes.

56
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,500
In other words, no one can see your Ninth Senior Brother before the ceremony.

57
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:09,050
- Not even you can see him?
- Of course I can, but you can't.

58
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,830
Second Younger Brother.

59
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,860
Preposterous. You dare to touch Father's person!

60
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,700
Why wouldn't I dare?

61
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:32,580
Even if someday you were to die somewhere, I wouldn't bother about you,

62
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,940
but you can't mess with this person.

63
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,420
He's just a measly immortal.

64
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,460
Just bait.

65
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:49,640
If you two want to coerce Mo Yuan, Ling Yu is good enough.

66
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,270
Just leave this one to me.

67
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:54,370
If Father didn't take pity on you and your mother,

68
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,450
trash like you would have have been kicked out a long time ago.

69
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:01,850
But as of today, you are still dawdling around here.

70
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,590
Dawdling?

71
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:08,760
I can clearly see that she is Mo Yuan's hidden female disciple in Kunlun Void.

72
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,880
She's pretending to be a man.

73
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,290
Eldest Brother, there is no need for you to be so berated.

74
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:19,260
The more I live aimlessly, the more happy you are. Right?

75
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:23,020
Fine. Great.

76
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,970
Be free and unfettered.

77
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:27,970
Once we declare war on the Heavenly Tribe,

78
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,460
let's see what you will do.

79
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:45,100
Beauty, you are a woman. Right?

80
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:50,090
Actually, I've already seen through your male guise magic.

81
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:05,070
Tell me. Are you a woman?

82
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:09,130
Can he really see through my magic?

83
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:16,490
You... Stop talking nonsense.

84
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,700
Tell the truth.

85
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,950
Did you really see through it?

86
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,520
Even Kunlun Void's people didn't see through it.

87
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,350
Great, this is the explanation.

88
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,090
You are really a woman.

89
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:31,540
I tricked the truth out of you so easily.

90
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,860
Why did you pretend to be a man in this Grand Purple Palace?

91
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,930
Are you afraid that my father would seize you and take you into the palace?

92
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,050
Don't worry.

93
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,990
My father is only using you to lure Mo Yuan here.

94
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,640
But your disciple brother is stubborn.

95
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,770
He's not as carefree as you, being drunk for ten days.

96
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,350
I heard that he's been thinking about suicide recently.

97
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:57,040
- Are you being serious?
- Yes.

98
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,910
Even the ceremony invitations have been sent out in order to humiliate your Kunlun Void.

99
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:05,330
If Mo Yuan can come and rescue you two, that'll be fine;

100
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,230
but if not even Mo Yuan can save you,

101
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:15,660
I'm afraid you and your senior brother will be skinned as a demonstration towards the Heavenly Tribe.

102
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,820
In both the heavens and Earth, nobody can defeat my teacher.

103
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,120
Are you really that confident?

104
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,500
My teacher is the God of War!

105
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,440
All right, all right. Your teacher is the most powerful.

106
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,010
However, according to me, it's best not to begin a war.

107
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:37,590
After all, if the two tribes clash in a war, all life would be plunged into misery and suffering.

108
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,550
How about this? Just wait patiently for a few days.

109
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:44,130
I already made plans to send you out of the palace on the third day of the next month.

110
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,390
What do you think?

111
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,590
You're going to help me escape?

112
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,300
You don't trust me?

113
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,400
Why would you help me?

114
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,360
We've gotten along since our first meeting.

115
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,540
Even if you don't want me as a friend, I want you as a friend.

116
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,330
Fine, then!

117
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,880
No matter the future relationship between the Heavenly and Winged Tribes,

118
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,790
we will be friends, since we have such a fate between us.

119
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,560
Sit down.

120
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,440
Write whatever you'd like to say to your senior brother on this piece of paper.

121
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,700
I'll deliver it to him tonight so that he can relax.

122
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,190
Okay.

123
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,870
By the way, I have something to ask you.

124
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,550
My younger sister, Yan Zhi, likes you.

125
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:43,130
Why don't I send her out of the palace along with you?

126
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:46,140
Help me take care of her for the rest of her life. What do you say?

127
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,500
I... Don't do that.

128
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,900
I... I'm also a woman.

129
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,670
Don't joke with me.

130
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,460
Then, tell me how you'll also explain to her that you're a woman.

131
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,570
Can't tell her. Can't tell her.

132
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:07,440
Fine, then. Since you're a woman, I won't put my younger sister through such suffering.

133
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,230
Keep writing.

134
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:29,090
I am the second prince of the Winged Realm.

135
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,730
This is a letter written to you from your junior brother.

136
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,560
Junior Brother?

137
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:43,500
Once you are done reading this, I'm taking it away.

138
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:07,680
How has Your Second Highness come to like gazing at the lotuses all of a sudden?

139
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,900
You are here at the lotus pond several times a day.

140
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:17,180
Occasionally being graceful and refined. Is that not okay?

141
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,790
Your Second Highness!

142
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,920
- Second Older Brother.
- Have you completed it?

143
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:53,930
This time Father's sending out the ceremony invitation to humiliate Kunlun Void means he's determined to rebel.

144
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:59,380
If we really release Si Yin like this, it'll be hard to see each other again.

145
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:06,800
As a princess of the Winged Tribe, it's impossible for me to be with someone from the Heavenly Tribe,

146
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,150
so whether I'm willing is not important.

147
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,560
You are right.

148
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:23,480
Someone from the Heavenly Tribe can never be with someone from the Grand Purple Palace.

149
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:38,710
Teacher, Teacher, hurry and come save us!

150
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,550
No. No, you can't come.

151
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:43,910
If you come, you'll fall into that Winged Monarch's trap.

152
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,320
You're in the Winged Realm.

153
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,030
You're drunk again.

154
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:08,120
Ah Yin, I will tell you a secret.

155
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,110
Do you want to listen?

156
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:14,740
How much have you drunk?

157
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,450
Do you want to listen or not?

158
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:21,380
Looks like you really regard me as your friend.

159
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,250
Speak.

160
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:30,320
Ah Yin, I like you.

161
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,210
What?

162
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:38,090
Hello. You are taking off my clothes again?!

163
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:42,370
Since you've already accepted me by remaining silent, why are you being bashful?

164
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:45,880
When have I accepted you by remaining silent?

165
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,910
You like me?

166
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:11,260
You've drunk too much and are acting crazy.

167
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,680
[Ceremony Invitation]

168
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:47,630
Qing Cang actually dares to humiliate Kunlun Void so openly?!

169
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,710
With Mo Yuan's personality, he'd never allow it.

170
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:56,310
It looks like Qing Cang is determined to rebel this time.

171
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:04,970
Go secretly investigate the current situation in Grand Purple Palace, especially Qing Cang's sons and daughter.

172
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,820
Yes.

173
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:18,610
Such a bully! They actually dare to kidnap Kunlun Void's disciples,

174
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:22,120
and openly send an invitation to humiliate my teacher!

175
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,650
Right! The Winged Realm has gone too far.

176
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:31,200
Second Senior Brother, since Teacher is currently in retreat, and Eldest Senior is searching in the Mortal Realm,

177
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,190
you're the only one in charge of Kunlun Void.

178
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:38,790
With just one word from you, we'll charge into Winged Realm and save Ninth Junior Brother and little Seventeenth.

179
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,890
- Right!
- Right!
- Right!

180
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:43,090
We can't be so impulsive.

181
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,420
- Teacher!
- Teacher!

182
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,420
You may all rise.

183
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,750
- Yes.
- Yes.

184
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:05,360
Teacher, Ninth Junior Brother and Seventeenth have been kidnapped by Winged Monarch Qing Cang.

185
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:11,380
The Winged Monarch even sent an invitation, forcing Ninth Junior Brother to be his godson in order to humiliate our Kunlun Void.

186
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,360
I already heard about it.

187
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,160
We were just talking about going to Grand Purple Palace and taking them back.

188
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,120
I will go alone.

189
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,510
After all, the Winged Tribe has yet to openly declare war on the Heavenly Tribe,

190
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:25,050
so we don't need to mobilize too many people.

191
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,820
Quickly call Die Feng back.

192
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,750
Once I return, immediately close off the mountain.

193
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:32,140
Nobody else is to enter or exit Kunlun Void.

194
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,460
Yes!

195
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:56,830
You... Why was I sleeping in your place?

196
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:07,010
You were drunk last night, and ran here in the middle of the night, saying that you like me.

197
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:11,070
What did you say? Hey!

198
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:15,090
I... I'm telling you, I didn't do it on purpose.

199
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:19,820
I really see you as a friend. Us Winged Tribesmen can't be with Heavenly Tribesmen.

200
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,130
Right. You didn't do it on purpose.

201
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:29,620
You! What does this mean?

202
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,630
You're acting like I took advantage of you.

203
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:35,300
You almost ripped off my clothes last night.

204
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,870
You're lying!

205
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:43,610
You almost ripped my clothes off twice, yet you're saying that I'm lying?

206
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,540
I--!

207
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,390
I really did?

208
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,650
Little immortal.

209
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:18,490
Yes, Your Highness.

210
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:21,030
Have you seen my second older brother?

211
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,910
- The Second Prince?
- Yes.

212
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:29,070
He... He was drunk last night, and slept in my room overnight.

213
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:31,750
Then what?

214
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,900
Then... Then, he left.

215
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:47,360
My second older brother and I are planning to send you two away in these upcoming days.

216
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,260
Thank you, Your Highness.

217
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:55,280
No need to thank me. Winged Tribesmen only do things for our own benefit.

218
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,540
I...

219
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,330
I...

220
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:04,730
Never mind. You can keep enjoying the lotuses.

221
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,750
What a shame.

222
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,680
I'm also a woman.

223
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,900
How can I avoid wasting your sincerity?

224
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,160
What's wrong with me?

225
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,900
Do I really like her?

226
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:38,650
Teacher.

227
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,160
Teacher, I knew you would come to save us.

228
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,000
Are you okay?

229
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,350
I will eventually get revenge for today's grudge.

230
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:51,290
Let's go save your Ninth Senior Brother first.

231
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,790
Teacher. Teacher.

232
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,390
Senior Brother! Senior Brother!

233
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,990
I'm an unworthy disciple. I've burdened you, Teacher.

234
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:14,140
You are my disciple, so don't apologize for such a thing.

235
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,910
Let's leave now.

236
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:28,610
Who is that? How dare you trespass Grand Purple Palace?

237
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:30,590
Attack!

238
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:39,780
Teacher, let's leave now.

239
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:50,190
Hurry and report back to my father.

240
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:21,600
Mo Yuan!

241
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:29,300
I can't believe you would violate the alliance contract between our two tribes for your disciples

242
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:34,090
and kill people in my Grand Purple Palace.

243
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:43,350
Qing Cang, although you're the king of your tribe, you are actually a coward.

244
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:47,730
You actually used such a dirty trick of kidnapping my disciples.

245
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:55,300
If you want to have a battle, let's do it.

246
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,510
Just as I wished.

247
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:22,710
- Li Jing!
- Hurry and run! He has the Donghuang Bell!

248
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,590
Teacher!

249
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,930
The heavenly tribulation.

250
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:38,120
Let's go.

251
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,520
You bastard!

252
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:56,620
Just kill me.

253
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,670
Do you think I'm scared to kill you?

254
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,490
Of course, I know you want to kill me.

255
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,710
I also know why you won't kill me.

256
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:15,290
Unfilial son. Don't forget who gave you this supreme glory.

257
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:19,010
Men! Lock up this unfilial son.

258
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:21,930
Without my consent, no one can release him!

259
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:23,920
- Yes.
- Yes.

260
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,560
- Teacher!
- Teacher!

261
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,260
- Close off the mountain.
- Yes!

262
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,840
Zi Lan, come here.

263
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,870
- Everyone else, come with me.
- Yes!

264
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:59,370
Teacher.

265
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:12,020
Teacher! Teacher!

266
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,800
Teacher, let me out! Teacher!

267
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:18,390
Teacher, let me out! Teacher! Teacher!

268
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:25,250
Teacher, I should be the one to endure this heavenly lightning.

269
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:30,230
Let me out!

270
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,260
Teacher!

271
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:44,480
Teacher! Teacher, this is my heavenly tribulation!

272
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,960
Teacher!

273
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:09,690
Teacher! Teacher! Teacher!

274
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:13,890
- Teacher! Teacher!
- Seventeenth! Seventeenth, you're awake.

275
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:16,360
Teacher is in retreat.

276
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,660
Teacher.

277
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:22,500
Teacher is in retreat?

278
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:31,590
Teacher took three heavenly lightnings on your behalf yesterday

279
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:36,000
Seventeenth, you should seriously focus on improving yourself in the future.

280
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,050
Otherwise, it'll be bad if Teacher has to endure your next tribulation to transcend into a High God.

281
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,220
Heavenly lightning.

282
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:48,410
How is Teacher doing?

283
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,660
Before he went to save you two from the Winged Realm, he mentioned closing off the mountain.

284
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,760
I thought that something had gone wrong.

285
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,440
It turns out that Teacher was already prepared to take the heavenly lightning for you,

286
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,270
and also worried that if the Winged Realm came for revenge, we wouldn't be able to fight them off while he's in retreat.

287
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:06,010
Seventeenth! Seventeenth! Seventeenth, where are you going?

288
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:30,840
Teacher! Are you seriously injured?

289
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:38,020
Teacher, I am useless.

290
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:40,430
I was a hindrance to you.

291
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,610
I have been studying under you for 20,000 years,

292
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:46,170
but I couldn't even predict the day of my heavenly tribulation.

293
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:48,210
Teacher, hurry and come out!

294
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:51,890
I'll cook myself into soup for you.

295
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:04,470
Teacher!

296
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,870
He's gravely injured.

297
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:10,210
If you keep crying, he'll get distracted and become possessed.

298
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:12,500
Such a stupid fox.

299
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:33,910
- Greetings, Your Highness.
- Have you seen the Second Prince?

300
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:38,500
His Second Highness is locked up.

301
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:43,400
- Why?
- Because of those two little immortals.

302
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,920
Your Second Highness.

303
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:07,770
Second Older Brother, why don't you go hide in the Mortal Realm for now?

304
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:10,520
Once Father Monarch calms down, you can return.

305
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,010
Fine, then. I'll go have some fun.

306
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:15,990
Don't worry about me.

307
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:21,950
You, on the other hand, must not admit that you released me.

308
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,510
Second Older Brother, don't worry.

309
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:28,310
Even if Father Monarch finds out, he won't do anything to me.

310
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:39,460
By the way, if you... see Si Yin, greet him for me.

311
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:54,780
Your Second Highness, will we go to the Bright Jade Garden that we frequently visit?

312
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:57,750
No, let's go to Kunlun Void.

313
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,200
Kunlun Void?

314
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,210
That... That's the sacred place of the Heavenly Tribe.

315
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:25,540
Seventeenth, you never studied this seriously 20,000 years ago.

316
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:29,070
After your heavenly tribulation, you learned to study Dao.

317
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,690
Eldest Senior Brother, you came just in time.

318
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:33,290
I have a question for you.

319
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:35,470
Look here.

320
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,940
"At the appearance of the Donghuang, the world will become ash.

321
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,710
Everything under the heavens will face destruction."

322
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:45,090
Is it saying that Donghuang Bell is a top-tier magical and unusual weapon,

323
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:48,870
that Teacher created it, and it's one of the Heavenly Realm's magical weapons?

324
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:51,390
Seventeenth, if you had studied so hard earlier,

325
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:53,890
Teacher wouldn't have needed to endure the tribulation for you.

326
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,660
Hurry and run! He has the Donghuang Bell!

327
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:08,580
Eldest Senior Brother, a guest is looking for Si Yin.

328
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:19,150
I'm the fourth son of Green Hill's Fox Emperor, Bai Zhen.

329
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,830
Fourth Older Brother! Fourth Older Brother!

330
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,950
This is great!

331
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:32,800
Since I grew up around High God Zhe Yan,

332
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,140
I'm used to calling him my fourth older brother.

333
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,610
Fourth Older Brother, this is the first disciple of High God Mo Yuan.

334
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:45,030
He's the second son of the Water Monarch of the Western Sea, Die Feng.

335
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,740
Kunlun Void really is spectacular.

336
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,160
No wonder Zhe Yan wanted to send you here to study.

337
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:57,490
You have turned our little Si Yin into a little suave immortal.

338
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:02,200
Why are you crying?

339
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,890
It's all my fault.

340
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:10,120
Teacher had to endure my heavenly tribulation for me.

341
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,260
No wonder the aura around you is different.

342
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,740
It turns out you've transcended.

343
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:18,490
Your teacher is so good to you.

344
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:21,220
Not anybody can endure a heavenly tribulation.

345
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,420
We're all family here. You two can chat.

346
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,210
I'll ask the kitchen to prepare more food for you.

347
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:29,960
Don't trouble yourself. I was just passing by and also checking on Si Yin, who had just experienced the heavenly tribulation.

348
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,250
I won't stay long.

349
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:35,270
Then, I really should give you two some space. Make yourself at home.

350
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,880
Come here, Fourth Older Brother. Come here.

351
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:47,120
Fourth Older Brother, you just got here. Why are you in a rush to leave?

352
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,410
Because of the trouble in the Winged Realm.

353
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:51,020
Qing Cang?

354
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:54,530
Right. It's because of Qing Cang.

355
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:55,890
Now that we're on this topic,

356
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:59,830
instead of staying in Kunlun Void, why did you run to the Winged Realm?

357
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:02,930
I heard that Second Sister-in-Law was about to give birth,

358
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:05,850
so I wanted to go home for a look.

359
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:09,870
You, seriously... It's no surprise you're the daughter of the Fox Emperor.

360
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:13,470
You created chaos in all the realms with just one harmless trip.

361
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,740
Because of Mo Yuan and Qing Cang's battle in Grand Purple Palace,

362
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:23,300
Heavenly Monarch is very worried and asked Zhe Yan over to discuss how to suppress the Winged Realm.

363
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:26,350
Thus, I came to visit Kunlun Void on the way.

364
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:28,000
They're going to suppress the Winged Realm?

365
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,060
Is Qing Cang really trying to rebel?

366
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,780
It'll happen eventually.

367
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:37,710
You're Mo Yuan's youngest disciple.

368
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:41,380
He probably wouldn't send you onto the battlefield, right?

369
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:47,300
One day as my teacher, one lifetime as my father.

370
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:50,190
If Teacher really needs to lead an army into battle,

371
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:52,690
I won't avoid it.

372
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,730
On the day Father God returned to a formless mass,

373
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:15,950
I sealed my weapon, the Zither of Fuxi, under the Kunlun Mountains.

374
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:19,030
Even if I have intentions of helping out in this battle,

375
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:21,640
I have no means of attacking.

376
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,790
I understand.

377
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:27,320
Go report to Kunlun Void.

378
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,980
Yes.

379
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:38,580
On the day of Qing Cang's defeat, I will send someone to deliver

380
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:42,140
peach blossom wine that I personally made to celebrate your victory, Heavenly Monarch.

381
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,840
Thank you, High God.

382
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,700
Farewell.

383
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,750
The ancient high gods have mostly died off.

384
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:59,930
Only a few of them remain, but they've retired from the world, and they can't be of help.

385
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:06,120
If you need someone to resolve this temporary crisis, Mo Yuan will be enough.

386
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:09,670
But if you want to ensure the eternal peace among the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses,

387
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:13,890
it's better to support onto the throne a Winged Monarch who obeys you.

388
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:18,080
Find a chance to replace Qing Cang.

389
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:21,440
Emperor, do you already have someone in mind?

390
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,760
Heavenly Monarch,

391
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:39,300
Winged Tribe's eldest prince, Li Yuan, has always hated the Heavenly Tribe.

392
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:44,020
The second prince, Li Jing, is useless and indulges in women all day long.

393
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:50,290
As the rumors say, in order to consolidate power, the first prince has been bullying and oppressing the second prince.

394
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:53,420
The father and sons are not of one heart, and the siblings are fighting amongst themselves.

395
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:56,550
That's the current situation of Grand Purple Palace.

396
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:03,790
Father Monarch, Emperor's words are correct.

397
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:08,680
If we find a good chance to support Li Jing onto the Winged Monarch throne,

398
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:12,750
we'll be able to ensure longlived peace.

399
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,600
Right.

400
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,730
The more useless he is,

401
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:23,430
the easier he is to control.

402
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:32,380
Young Fifth, I'm leaving now.

403
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:36,090
Fourth Older Brother, what's the name of my niece?

404
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:39,530
Fengjiu. Bai Fengjiu.

405
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,730
Fengjiu?

406
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:43,800
The phoenix (feng) flies through the Nine (jiu) Heavens.

407
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,660
It sounds like a great name.

408
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:50,180
That's a good explanation for it.

409
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:54,410
I just hope that this kind of name won't damage her future marriage.

410
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:55,960
Has Mother tried to read her fortune yet?

411
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,140
She was just born. Why are you already worried about her marriage?

412
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:01,710
Our family is most worried about you.

413
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:05,690
Quickly finish your training so you can leave this mountain, and we can find a good husband for you.

414
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:09,220
Otherwise, Mother will keep nagging me to get married.

415
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,920
Get married, then!

416
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,460
You're always using me as your shield.

417
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:17,530
All right. I really have to go now.

418
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:24,350
Young Fifth, you must remember that as a disciple of Kunlun Void, you need to follow Mo Yuan onto the battlefield.

419
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:26,510
We don't have the right to dissuade you

420
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:29,160
and our parents would never stop you,

421
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:32,230
since this is your duty as a disciple.

422
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:35,530
But you must remember that you have four older brothers.

423
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:40,800
No matter what happens, don't carry the burden alone.

424
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,590
Okay, got it.

425
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:09,940
Ah Yin, I've come.

426
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:21,810
I heard that the dragon energy in Kunlun Void clashes with our physique the most.

427
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:28,430
I'm afraid that this dragon energy will hurt Your Second Highness's spirit.

428
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:31,100
Is it really that strong?

429
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,590
I really want to try it out.

430
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:37,010
Your Second Highness!

431
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,630
You've been following me since you were young.

432
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:44,660
When have you ever seen me so serious about a person before?

433
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:50,530
I just want to see her.

434
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:52,900
Wait for me here at the foot of the mountain.

435
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:57,570
Don't follow me.

436
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:45,880
Who dares trespass Kunlun Void?

437
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:49,770
Thank you for saving me. I'm looking for Ah Yin.

438
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:51,760
Seventeenth?

439
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,740
Who are you?

440
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,070
Ah Yin calls me his elder brother.

441
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:00,030
Elder brother?

442
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:06,270
Fine, then. I don't think you would dare to lie in Kunlun Void.

443
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:08,180
Follow me.

444
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:16,750
Wait.

445
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:36,060
What are you doing?

446
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:41,770
I can't come to the sacred place of the Heavenly Tribe in untidy clothes.

447
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:44,360
That's disrespectful to High God Mo Yuan.

448
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,440
That's right.

449
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,390
Come with me.

450
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:09,690
Your Second Highness?

451
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:11,730
Ah Yin!

452
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:14,790
Thank you for helping me escape Grand Purple Palace the other day.

453
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:17,600
Did your father make things difficult for you?

454
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,770
Why is your face injured?

455
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:23,980
I'm fine. Ah Yin, I've thought it through.

456
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:27,290
I came this time to be with you.

457
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:31,590
What did you say? This...

458
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:36,780
I'm willing to give up my identity and status just to be with you forever.

459
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:40,150
I... I...

460
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:46,520
B-But I'm a disciple of Kunlun Void.

461
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:52,250
I saw that you get along well with the ladies who serve you.

462
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:55,250
You're not lacking women.

463
00:41:58,290 --> 00:41:59,990
I knew it.

464
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:04,900
I knew that I would shock you, but listen to me.

465
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,720
Ever since you left Grand Purple Palace,

466
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,190
and I was imprisoned by my father in the dungeon,

467
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,700
I've been thinking about you day and night.

468
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:18,980
That's when I knew my heart could never hold another person.

469
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:51,450
”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

470
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:53,560
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

471
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:56,260
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

472
00:42:56,260 --> 00:43:01,620
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

473
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:10,880
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

474
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:14,920
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

475
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:20,320
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

476
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:25,540
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

477
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:32,840
♫ All are just illusions ♫

478
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:38,900
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

479
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:44,440
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

480
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:49,170
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

481
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:55,190
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

482
00:43:55,190 --> 00:44:00,140
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

483
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:05,820
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

484
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:08,550
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

485
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:16,670
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from my previous life ♫

486
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:29,610
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds
are as sudden as a dream ♫

487
00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:35,050
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

488
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:39,490
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

489
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:45,830
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

490
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:50,920
♫ When will the cold ten miles
of peach blossoms bloom again? ♫

491
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:56,260
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

492
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:59,270
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

493
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:07,300
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

494
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:20,580
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
