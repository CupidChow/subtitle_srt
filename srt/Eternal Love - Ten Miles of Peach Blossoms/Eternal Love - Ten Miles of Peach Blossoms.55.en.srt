”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

2
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,500
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,050
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:24,610
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:28,050
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,380
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,120
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,740
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,260
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,820
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:49,340
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,880
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,360
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,950
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:03,490
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,760
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,520
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,990
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,960
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,720
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,130
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:24,650
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:27,860
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:31,790
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,450
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:38,830
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:42,110
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:46,770
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

[Eternal Love]

30
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:13,000
[Episode 55]

31
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,640
- Your Highness the Crown Prince.
- Your Highness the Crown Prince.

32
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,440
Your Highness the Crown Prince, I have been looking for you.

33
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,190
Shouldn't you wake up from Pure Wutong Palace?

34
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:36,940
I don't know. I woke up from Kunlun Void.

35
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,970
How did you know I was back?

36
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:45,590
I read the Book of Fate and knew you had an unrequited love and was sick at a young age.

37
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,050
It's good that you are back. There's a major issue in the hall.

38
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,560
You should come with me to take a look.

39
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,860
What happened?

40
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,770
High Goddess Bai Qian intruded into Pure Wutong Palace.

41
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:59,930
After taking Lady Su Jin's eyes, she disappeared.

42
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,810
Then, Young Highness from Green Hill came here later and created a scene with Lady Su Jin.

43
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,030
One said that Green Hill bullied her and the other said that Lady Su Jin framed High Goddess.

44
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:08,470
One said that Green Hill bullied her and the other said that Lady Su Jin framed High Goddess.

45
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,460
They were locked in a heated dispute.

46
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:14,890
Did you say that Qian Qian robbed Su Jin's eyes?

47
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,500
Yes.

48
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,270
- Qian Qian.
- Your Highness, you can't leave.

49
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:23,050
The emperor said that you are the only one who can settle this.

50
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,070
Fine.

51
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,960
Help me to invite three people here.

52
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:34,470
My Second Uncle, Third Uncle and Yuan Zhen who just came back from tribulation in the Mortal Realm.

53
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:38,560
- Yes.
- Also, there's a puppet who serves my mother in the Mortal Realm.

54
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,140
Her name is Su Su.

55
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,600
Su Su?

56
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,840
I'm going now.

57
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,790
Your Highness the Crown Prince,

58
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:58,930
I wonder why you want to see us that urgently? What's going on?

59
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:05,090
Today, I want to redress Yuan Zhen and return justice to him.

60
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,560
Forget it.

61
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,430
Yuan Zhen has returned from tribulation.

62
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:14,460
High Goddess Bai Qian didn't suffer from protecting him in the Mortal Realm.

63
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:19,400
Let's not have this justice.

64
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:24,880
I know that Father Monarch punished Yuan Zhen because when I was demoted to Water Monarch of Southern Sea,

65
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,120
I know that Father Monarch punished Yuan Zhen because when I was demoted to Water Monarch of Southern Sea,

66
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,920
I still doted on Shao Xin.

67
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,950
He was angry and merely wanted to teach me a lesson.

68
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:37,960
As his son, I hurt his heart.

69
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:43,840
What my son has to bear now, I have nothing much to say.

70
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:50,260
Ye Hua, I appreciate your kindness.

71
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:58,380
Second Uncle, have you ever thought, if you don't clear this matter today,

72
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:04,510
in the future, Yuan Zhen or perhaps your other children will go through this again.

73
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:07,320
What will you do then?

74
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,160
About this...

75
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,470
Second Older Brother, Ye Hua is right.

76
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:16,970
What's right or wrong, you should understand this.

77
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:21,630
Or else, it won't be fair to Yuan Zhen.

78
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,210
Fine.

79
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:32,070
When we are at the Great Hall, I will do according to what you say.

80
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,010
You only need to speak the truth.

81
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,930
Do you understand?

82
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,440
Fine.

83
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,590
Your Highness the Crown Prince, please take a look.

84
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:44,420
Is this the person?

85
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:47,220
That's right. It's her.

86
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,220
Let's go in.

87
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:11,160
That Bai Qian of Green Hill even threatened me.

88
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,240
She wants me to confess my sins and go and guard...

89
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,190
Go to Ruoshui to guard Qing Cang who was sealed in Donghuang Bell,

90
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:23,090
and never return to Heaven again. Right?

91
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:25,480
That's right.

92
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,600
At ease.

93
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,580
Your Highness the Crown Prince is back.

94
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,790
It just happens that I'm back today.

95
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:41,760
I heard something happened at the Great Hall today and came to take a look.

96
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,030
You should be here.

97
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:46,040
Talking about this, it's matters regarding your harem.

98
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:52,140
If you want me to preside over this, it's rather difficult, too.

99
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,200
Yes.

100
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,190
Ye Hua! Ye Hua!

101
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:01,590
Ye Hua, you must make the judgment today.

102
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,940
Ye Hua.

103
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,520
Don't worry.

104
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,490
I'm here today to make a judgement for you.

105
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,960
My Lady.

106
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,990
- Who are you?
- It's me, My Lady.

107
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:25,060
I don't know you. Don't call me!

108
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,470
My Lady.

109
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:30,040
Who are you? I don't know her. Tell her to leave now!

110
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,460
Don't follow me! Tell her to leave!

111
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,480
This is...?

112
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,590
A puppet?

113
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,610
Heavenly Monarch.

114
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:14,380
Ye Hua, what's going on?

115
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:20,530
When I was in the Mortal Realm undergoing my tribulation, Su Jin created this puppet to tempt me.

116
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:22,930
She didn't abide by the rules of Heaven.

117
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:25,670
Father Monarch, how will you punish her?

118
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:29,330
Using a sorcerer's black magic to charm the Crown Prince of the Heavenly Tribe,

119
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:33,560
it's equivalent to removing immortality and being demoted to livestock.

120
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,660
- Record this.
- Yes.

121
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,930
No, I didn't do this.

122
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:45,870
I didn't do this. It wasn't me!

123
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:50,340
Why is the Water Monarch of the Northern Sea so free today?

124
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:54,060
You even came to the Great Hall with your first son.

125
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:07,120
I'm here for the wrong judgment of Yuan Zhen.

126
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,970
Wrong judgment?

127
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:14,120
Are you saying that I made the wrong judgment then?

128
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,280
Yuan Zhen,

129
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,820
tell him what happened that day.

130
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,550
Yes.

131
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,120
Heavenly Monarch. Emperor. Aunts and Uncles.

132
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,320
Greetings, everyone.

133
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,030
Dispense with the formalities. Speak directly.

134
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,680
I'm here today.

135
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,580
I will seek justice for you.

136
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,760
Yes.

137
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,850
I didn't take liberties with Lady Su Jin.

138
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:46,560
That day on Heavenly Monarch's birthday, I came with Father for the celebrations.

139
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,050
Father Monarch went to meet Heavenly Monarch first and told me to wait outside.

140
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:55,320
Lady Su Jin came to me at this time and said that Heavenly Monarch was in Pure Wutong Palace.

141
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,750
She even smiled and said that she would take me there herself.

142
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,180
Subsequently, Lady Su Jin used a spell to render me unconscious.

143
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,420
She made me drunk and stripped my clothes.

144
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:08,630
When I woke up, Lady Su Jin cried and said that I took liberties with her.

145
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,390
Everything was very chaotic at the scene.

146
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:15,270
I sat there foolishly until I saw her hanging the white silk on the ceiling.

147
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,360
Heavenly Monarch came then.

148
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,850
This was what happened.

149
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,910
I'm done talking.

150
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:28,170
You spoke well and very clearly.

151
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:32,350
Su Jin, what refute do you have?

152
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,420
He's lying!

153
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:41,150
It was clearly him who was drunk, intruded into my bedchamber, and conspired against me.

154
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:43,570
He's lying.

155
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:47,790
Yuan Zhen, how many times had you been in the Heavenly Palace before that time?

156
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:50,080
It was my first time.

157
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:54,310
So, Su Jin, do you think that for a person who was at the Heavenly Palace for the first time,

158
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,310
would be able to find Pure Wutong Palace that easily,

159
00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:00,410
and was also able to find your bedchamber from the many bedchambers in Pure Wutong Palace

160
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,240
and indecently assaulted you?

161
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,050
I... He...

162
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:08,310
If you can't think of a reason, don't say anything first.

163
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,030
Lady Le Xu, regarding the sin of framing Heavenly Monarch's grandson,

164
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:16,550
how should this be handled?

165
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:20,420
Remove her immortality and demote her to being livestock.

166
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,730
- Si Ming.
- Here.

167
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,190
- Record this.
- Yes.

168
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:31,800
Before we even hold the trial regarding you and High Goddess Bai Qian,

169
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,880
how could you have committed so many sins?

170
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,870
No, Emperor!

171
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:41,360
Emperor, you are falsely accusing me!

172
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,060
You colluded with Bai Fengjiu of Green Hill to falsely accuse me! You falsely accuse me!

173
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,050
How presumptuous!

174
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:53,100
Heavenly Monarch. Heavenly Monarch.

175
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,920
Heavenly Monarch, you must make the judgment for me! Heavenly Monarch....

176
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,470
They... They are a group of villains.

177
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,980
Don't listen to them.

178
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,270
They ganged up together to falsely accuse me.

179
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:08,750
They are falsely accusing me, Heavenly Monarch.

180
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:21,280
Are you saying that I'm currying favors with these villains, too?

181
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:28,000
As my side consort, how could you slander the monarch?

182
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,130
What is the criminal charge for this?

183
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:34,120
It's a serious criminal charge.

184
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,910
It's even more serious than the two previous charges.

185
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:40,630
Su Jin, you must think carefully.

186
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,230
Ye Hua.

187
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,180
Ye Hua!

188
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:56,710
Ye Hua! Ye Hua!

189
00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:00,280
Ye Hua, you can't be so cruel towards me.

190
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,240
You can't.

191
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,590
Did you forget that I grew up with you?

192
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:10,330
I was... I was in a hurry just now and panicked.

193
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:13,880
Ye Hua, you can't slander me together with them.

194
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,350
You can't. You can't.

195
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,630
I'm the crown prince of the Heavenly Tribe.

196
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:22,700
I would never side with anyone.

197
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,520
Even if I want to side with someone,

198
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:29,200
I should take your side, who's my side consort. Isn't that so?

199
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,460
No!

200
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,180
You have never taken sides with me!

201
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,060
Never!

202
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:40,660
You have always excluded me.

203
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:45,500
No matter how well I treated you, it's useless.

204
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,540
It's useless.

205
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,320
What else do we still need to put on trial?

206
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:58,820
Based on High Goddess Bai Qian's personality in contrast with this inferior woman,

207
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,130
if we continue to hold the trial,

208
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:08,310
I fear Green Hill will blame us for believing this kind of woman who falsely accused the monarchess of Green Hill.

209
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:12,660
There's no need to continue with the trial.

210
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,870
Su Jin,

211
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,970
you have really disappointed me.

212
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:21,080
Too disappointing.

213
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:29,910
I think what the emperor said, it makes sense.

214
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,790
Fortunately, everyone here is within the family.

215
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,310
It wasn't amplified.

216
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:42,380
As the one who raised Su Jin from young till now, I'm very embarrassed to have taught such a woman.

217
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:45,570
Father Monarch, please issue the decree soon to dispose of her.

218
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:48,510
Lest something like this will happen again in the future.

219
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:56,700
I second this and have nothing to say, too.

220
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,610
I second this, too.

221
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,370
Uncles? Uncles!

222
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,440
Uncles, you can't do this to me.

223
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,550
You can't do this to me. Uncles, look at me.

224
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:15,730
I'm a princess of Nine Heavens.

225
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:17,670
Uncles.

226
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:23,040
Uncles, did you forget about my parents?

227
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,000
They sacrificed their lives to save you.

228
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,150
Did you forget this?

229
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,160
Look at you!

230
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,910
How can you be worthy of the loyalties of your parents?!

231
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:41,160
Su Jin, thinking about how your tribe was loyal,

232
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:46,750
I won't pursue the criminal charge for creating a puppet to tempt Ye Hua.

233
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:54,010
But regarding Yuan Zhen and High Goddess Bai Qian, you need to be punished.

234
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,840
Spend the rest of your life in Ruoshui now.

235
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,580
Take her away.

236
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,900
Don't, Heavenly Monarch!

237
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,740
I don't want to.

238
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,250
- I don't want to go. I won't go.
- My Lady.

239
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,130
- Emperor! Ye Hua!
- My Lady!

240
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:17,000
- I'm not leaving.
- My Lady.

241
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,780
Ye Hua,

242
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:27,440
you must not delay your wedding with High Goddess Bai Qian.

243
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:36,180
I will meet the Fox Emperor to set the date to marry her and bring her to Nine Heavens.

244
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,400
I will abide.

245
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:45,100
Congratulations, Your Highness the Crown Prince!

246
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:56,380
Ye Hua.

247
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,220
Mother Consort, what instructions do you have?

248
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:12,150
I really didn't expect High Goddess Bai Qian was the mortal Su Su from three hundred years ago.

249
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:23,530
Although you need to marry her due to the friendship between the Heavenly Tribe and Green Hill,

250
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:29,430
I still feel that it has caused you to suffer.

251
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:36,080
Regarding your wedding, what are your plans?

252
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,150
It's on the second day of September.

253
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,760
What?

254
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,100
Qian Qian said that the second day of September is an auspicious day.

255
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,700
She wants to hold the wedding on this day.

256
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:53,840
Mother Consort, don't worry.

257
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:59,330
No matter what happened in the past, she's still the one I have been waiting for.

258
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:03,220
Other than her, I don't want anyone else.

259
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,730
All right.

260
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:12,560
I will make the arrangements.

261
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,830
What's wrong?

262
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,470
Do you have any other matters?

263
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,930
I have something to ask you.

264
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:32,600
- Ask.
- If...

265
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:37,430
I'm saying if... that year, you didn't wipe out your name from the Three Lives Stone,

266
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:40,170
would you like me?

267
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:48,060
You haven't answered me.

268
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:53,090
I allowed you to ask, but I didn't say I would answer.

269
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:07,410
Why are you following me?

270
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:11,320
If you don't answer, I will keep following you.

271
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,420
Continue to follow then.

272
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:19,350
Emperor, are you still going to Ruoshui?

273
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,330
I'm going back to the study first.

274
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,170
Yes.

275
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:39,750
From today, I'm going to seclude myself in the valley.

276
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,210
I won't see anyone.

277
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:44,380
Yes, Great Lady.

278
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,770
It's not right. Where is Young Highness?

279
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,030
I better not disturb Great Lady.

280
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:02,560
In any case, with Young Highness' disposition, she wouldn't suffer.

281
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,390
Your Highness the Crown Prince, Great Lady has drunk a lot of wine.

282
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:32,940
She's asleep now and has instructed me that no one can enter her fox den.

283
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,940
Help me to bring a message to her.

284
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:40,850
Tell her that I will wait out here till she sees me.

285
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:42,840
Yes.

286
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:57,520
I set up the altar in front of the Great Hall, Mighty Monarch.

287
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,810
Good. Excellent.

288
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:08,360
Fortunately, you set up the altar within seven days.

289
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:19,540
It's also fortunate that Father Monarch is still in the Donghuang Bell and hasn't broken the seal yet.

290
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,810
It has been 70,000 years.

291
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:27,180
Who caused thousands of our people to die at the battle of Ruoshui then?

292
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,250
The Heavenly Tribe!

293
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:35,490
Our Winged Tribe's best food, most beautiful women and largest Night Pearls were offered to them.

294
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:38,750
Think. Think carefully.

295
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:42,450
- If the previous Winged Monarch were still here, would we have been subjected to this?
- That's right.

296
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,140
There has never been such precedent, right?

297
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,100
- That's right!
- That's correct!

298
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,680
Everyone, look at the sky.

299
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:53,600
This vision in the sky is the sign of the return of our legitimate Winged Monarch.

300
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,160
A day will come when our previous Winged Monarch returns with the Red Lotus Fire

301
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,230
to defeat the Heavenly Tribe and unite the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses!

302
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:06,030
- Winged Monarch, abdicate!
- Winged Monarch, abdicate!

303
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:20,400
Mighty Monarch, many ruffians have gathered outside Grand Purple Palace.

304
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,680
What should we do?

305
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:30,120
What you need to do is to guard Grand Purple Palace for these seven days.

306
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:42,790
I'm going to use these seven days to remove the red clouds from the sky and restore peace to the Winged Realm.

307
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:49,260
Father Monarch, when you used your children to train in venom,

308
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,990
you should have thought of today.

309
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:56,510
We are also the only few who can summon your spirit with our blood.

310
00:22:56,510 --> 00:23:03,570
Please return to the former monarch's Grand Purple Palace and sever the relationship with your son, Li Jing.

311
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:07,660
Whether it's the fate of my mother consort or Eldest Brother's fate,

312
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:12,960
you and me, father and son, will end this totally.

313
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,780
Li Jing, ungrateful son.

314
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,960
You even dare to use your blood to summon my spirit?

315
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,830
What are you trying to do?

316
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,840
I shouldn't have spared you 70,000 years ago.

317
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:32,910
Greetings.

318
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:35,360
Why are you here at Ruoshui?

319
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,670
What can I do for you?

320
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:40,190
This is Fairy Su Jin.

321
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:44,220
She has been directed by the Heavenly Monarch to present a letter to willingly remove her heavenly immortality.

322
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:47,750
She's here to cultivate and also guard the Donghuang Bell.

323
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:52,390
For old times sake, Heavenly Monarch was kind, permitting this and ordering me to send her here.

324
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:57,310
Fairy Su Jin is so kind that even Heaven appreciates her.

325
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:05,860
I'm taking my leave.

326
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:09,040
Let's go.

327
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,960
Isn't that Consort Su Jin?

328
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,200
Yes. I wonder what mistake she committed.

329
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,280
Her eyes were ruined, too. Heavenly Monarch instructed us to catch a big fish in the Northern Sea

330
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,790
and use its eyes to create fake eyes to place in her.

331
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,770
She can kind of recognize objects.

332
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,330
Is Mighty Monarch back?

333
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:37,480
He's back, but he's in Green Hill.

334
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,450
Green Hill?

335
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,390
Presumably, Mighty Monarch just came back from the Mortal Realm.

336
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:46,560
He should have gone to Green Hill to discuss the wedding with Great Lady.

337
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,750
All right, go back first.

338
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,450
Yes.

339
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,410
Ye Hua,

340
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,440
I love you.

341
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,410
I want to be with you forever.

342
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:46,080
At that time, I didn't look carefully into my heart.

343
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,090
Don't take those remarks I made to heart.

344
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:52,730
Now that we are in love,

345
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:55,360
naturally, we won't cancel the engagement.

346
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:25,180
Great Lady.

347
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:28,230
His Highness the Crown Prince has been watching at the entrance for seven days.

348
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,330
He said that he wants to see you.

349
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:39,230
I received your order and dare not let anyone in.

350
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:42,460
Even if he's His Highness the Crown Prince, I dare not let him in, either.

351
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,310
But it has been seven days.

352
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:48,570
His Highness the Crown Prince has no indication of leaving.

353
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:54,590
I can't make the decision and can only come in to inquire about what I should do.

354
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:10,110
Ye Hua, three hundred years ago, did you marry me because Su Jin betrayed you?

355
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:12,790
Did you ever love me?

356
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:16,520
If it was love, how deep was your love?

357
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,590
If I wasn't deceived in jumping off from the Immortal Execution Platform,

358
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:23,050
would you have willingly married Su Jin?

359
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:29,600
Were your affections for me due to remorse from what happened three hundred years ago?

360
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,650
What if he says yes and admits to everything?

361
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:37,880
Great Lady, will you see him or not?

362
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:42,440
I'm not seeing him.

363
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:49,820
Tell him never to come to Green Hill again.

364
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:54,620
I will see Heavenly Monarch tomorrow to cancel the engagement.

365
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,560
Yes.

366
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:34,920
Your Highness the Crown Prince, our Great Lady still...

367
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,660
She still doesn't want to see me?

368
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:41,940
Not really so. She's confused from drinking too much and ignores me, too.

369
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:44,190
Your Highness has been standing here for seven days.

370
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:46,290
Why don't you go back first?

371
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:48,770
When Great Lady is sober, I will invite you again.

372
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:51,420
I'm not going anywhere.

373
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:56,470
I'm going to get an umbrella for your first. I fear it's going to rain.

374
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,500
No need.

375
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:03,080
I'm taking my leave then.

376
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,120
Mi Gu.

377
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,690
Your Highness the Crown Prince, what instructions do you have?

378
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:11,790
Relay another message for me.

379
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:14,050
Your Highness, please speak.

380
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,760
When I was undergoing the tribulation in the Mortal Realm,

381
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:25,460
your Great Lady told me if I had any romantic relationship with another woman in the Mortal Realm,

382
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:28,660
she would bring me back to Green Hill and lock me up.

383
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:39,080
If she counts the maid that I brought home to serve my mother in the Mortal Realm as a romantic relationship,

384
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:45,990
ask her if what she said before still counts.

385
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:49,940
All right, I will definitely relay the message to her.

386
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:15,460
Great Lady, His Highness Crown Prince has a message for you.

387
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:20,930
He wanted to ask you... When you said that if he had a romantic relationship in the Mortal Realm,

388
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:23,420
you would lock him up in Green Hill.

389
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:30,500
If you count the maid that he brought home to serve his mother in the Mortal Realm as a romantic relationship,

390
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:34,400
do your words still count?

391
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:38,640
It doesn't count.

392
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,470
Whatever I said doesn't count.

393
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:44,440
Tell him to leave!

394
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,120
I don't want to see him again!

395
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,920
Great Lady, don't be angry! Great Lady, don't be angry!

396
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,980
Leave! Go!

397
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:55,660
♫ My temple has once been covered in frost, and it once reflected light for you ♫

398
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:58,370
♫ Years flow by leisurely, ♫

399
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:09,830
♫ So how can I waste my time wandering and exchanging it for some growth? ♫

400
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,310
♫ Cold and brilliant peach blossoms become hotter in this lifetime ♫

401
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:16,930
♫  become hotter in this lifetime ♫

402
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:19,610
♫ I’ve placed one blossom on my heart ♫

403
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:31,390
♫ Which is enough to keep me company for three lives and three worlds by the waters ♫

404
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:36,780
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

405
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,940
Mighty Monarch, you have new injuries and old wounds.

406
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,920
You don't have enough cultivation to protect your body.

407
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,190
You shouldn't be drenched in the rain.

408
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:45,050
- Remove the umbrella.
- Mighty Monarch.

409
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:48,580
Remove it!

410
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:54,700
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

411
00:32:54,700 --> 00:33:00,190
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

412
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:05,360
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

413
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,380
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

414
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:14,920
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from
my previous life ♫

415
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,950
Your Mighty Monarch has been standing there for seven days?

416
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:19,510
Yes, High God.

417
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:21,680
Please persuade Great Lady.

418
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:26,190
You know very well that when he went to refine the medicinal pill to save High God Mo Yuan,

419
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:29,270
he lost his cultivation and his arm, too.

420
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:31,680
He almost died and went to the Netherworld.

421
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:35,000
It wasn't easy for High God Zhe Yan to save his life.

422
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,540
If he continues to torment himself, he will die young.

423
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,430
I spit on it. What are you saying?

424
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:42,900
Stop cursing my brother-in-law.

425
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,620
Does this mean you have agreed to persuade Great Lady?

426
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:48,420
I can't. I won't be able to persuade her.

427
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:51,140
Why not?

428
00:33:56,550 --> 00:34:00,180
Jia Yun, are you married?

429
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,400
I'm not.

430
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:06,630
When a married couple fights, it's their personal issue.

431
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:09,950
Sometimes, it's useless to persuade anymore.

432
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:12,700
The more you persuade, the worse it will be.

433
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,720
That's right.

434
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:19,070
If we can't persuade him, even his biological son wouldn't succeed, either.

435
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:22,750
In any case, just wait.

436
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:24,130
Wait?

437
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:26,670
Wait till our young fifth has thought it through.

438
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:29,940
Do you think it's that easy to marry our monarchess of Green Hill?

439
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:33,650
We have four older brothers in our generation, there is only a younger sister.

440
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:36,250
She's very stubborn.

441
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:40,070
She's also a high goddess who has been tortured by others and even had her eyes dug out.

442
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:42,650
Of course, she will be in pain for a few days.

443
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:45,470
But it's okay. Everything will be fine in a few days.

444
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:47,890
What if it doesn't?

445
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,690
It won't.

446
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:55,240
We can see her love for Ye Hua.

447
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:00,400
High Gods, please rest.

448
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,880
I'm taking my leave.

449
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,590
How's the Donghuang Bell?

450
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:27,930
It has been raining heavily for the past few days at the bank of Ruoshui River.

451
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:32,320
Is there a problem?

452
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,300
Emperor, should we ask His Highness the Crown Prince

453
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,470
since he has been monitoring the movements of Ruoshui?

454
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:42,240
Perhaps, he's already aware of some bad news.

455
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,010
Where is Ye Hua?

456
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:47,260
He's... in Green Hill.

457
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:50,070
That's right.

458
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:52,030
He should be in Green Hill.

459
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:55,510
Let's not talk about those "absence makes the heart grows fonder" for lovers.

460
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:58,060
- Yes.
- Forget it.

461
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:02,410
I will personally go there so that I can be assured.

462
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,730
- Si Ming.
- Here.

463
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:28,850
No matter what happens, protect Young Highness.

464
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:30,560
Yes.

465
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,240
Father Monarch, stop struggling.

466
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:21,500
Please come back to this Winged Realm which went downhill because of the war you started 70,000 years ago,

467
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:25,510
and this Grand Purple Palace which was popular in the past and has been dispersed.

468
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,900
Ungrateful son!

469
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:35,270
Do you want me to kill you?!

470
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:58,400
- Emperor.
- How was last night?

471
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,260
There were surging waves and dark clouds overhead last night.

472
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:04,470
This scene caused me to be uneasy.

473
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:06,550
I lost my divine power.

474
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:09,390
I can't explore the situation inside of Donghuang Bell.

475
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:13,780
But looking at the sign in the sky, Qing Cang's spirit may have stabilized.

476
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:16,860
He will rush out from the Donghuang Bell soon.

477
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:20,190
If we want to explore the situation of Donghuang Bell, we can only use the Soul-Pursuing Spell.

478
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:22,450
I don't know how to use this spell.

479
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:26,900
Si Ming, go to Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms now and invite High God Zhe Yan to come here.

480
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,850
Yes.

481
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:32,540
Emperor, I know the Soul-Pursuing Spell.

482
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,240
You?

483
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,050
Aunt and Zhe Yan taught me when I was in Ten Miles of Peach Blossom Forest.

484
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:38,260
Hence, I know how to use it.

485
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:43,310
Moreover, your divine power was because when we were in the Mortal Realm...

486
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:46,370
Let me handle this.

487
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,430
Emperor, stop hesitating.

488
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:51,440
Let me go.

489
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:23,020
Emperor, there isn't any spirit in here.

490
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,720
What?

491
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,420
Perhaps... Perhaps, my divine power is not refined.

492
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,780
I will give it another try.

493
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,170
Ungrateful son.

494
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:25,680
You even dared to retain my spirit?

495
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:29,790
Father Monarch, it has been a long time.

496
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:43,720
Don't forget.

497
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,600
Only your spirit is here.

498
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,890
You won't be able to touch me.

499
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:52,200
My biggest mistake was to spare you 70,000 years ago.

500
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,380
My biggest mistake was to spare you 70,000 years ago.

501
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:57,950
You are wrong!

502
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:00,490
Your biggest mistake was raising me from young till now.

503
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:03,460
You only wanted to use me to improve your divine power, right?

504
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:09,070
To raise me as venom.

505
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:13,290
Who's the most vicious father in the kingdom?!

506
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,430
You exhausted all military resources.

507
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:23,740
Hundreds of thousands of Winged soldiers died in a night.

508
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,930
You deserve to be killed!

509
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:33,180
You raised your son to be venom and you are extremely cruel.

510
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:35,460
You deserve to be killed!

511
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:39,610
You distinctly knew that when Red Lotus Fire was back, it would destroy the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses.

512
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:42,660
You want the people in the kingdom to be buried with you without any hesitation.

513
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,890
You deserve to be killed!

514
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,770
Ungrateful son.

515
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:52,160
Did you forget my kindness in raising you?

516
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:56,160
Did you forget my blood that's flowing in you?

517
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:59,190
You want to kill your father?

518
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:02,050
This is outrageous.

519
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:10,690
You used all your blood to summon my spirit.

520
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:13,720
How much longer will you live?

521
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:17,270
Fine.

522
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:23,800
Then, our father and son relationship will end here today.

523
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:38,400
Double-Sided Halberd?

524
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,760
You didn't expect this, did you?

525
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:47,940
Even if I couldn't injure you, wouldn't this Double-Sided Halberd hurt you?

526
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:52,540
Li Jing, I want your life!

527
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:28,750
”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

528
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:30,840
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

529
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:33,450
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

530
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:38,740
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

531
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:48,060
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

532
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,050
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

533
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:57,430
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

534
00:43:57,430 --> 00:44:03,380
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

535
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:09,830
♫ All are just illusions ♫

536
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:16,390
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

537
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:21,570
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

538
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:26,100
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

539
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:32,220
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

540
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:37,650
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

541
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:42,860
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

542
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:45,780
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

543
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:55,240
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from
my previous life ♫

544
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:06,800
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

545
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:12,300
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

546
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:16,720
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

547
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:22,910
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

548
00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:28,200
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

549
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:33,570
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

550
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:36,480
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

551
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:45,130
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

552
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:57,800
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
