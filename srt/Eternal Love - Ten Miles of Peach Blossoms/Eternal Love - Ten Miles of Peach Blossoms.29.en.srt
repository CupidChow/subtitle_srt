”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

2
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:17,560
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,200
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,520
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously

5
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,030
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:31,450
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:35,210
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,830
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,250
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,030
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,470
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:53,110
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:56,560
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity

14
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,370
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,620
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,760
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,580
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:14,010
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,120
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,820
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,360
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,840
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,210
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:31,970
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,690
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:39,010
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:42,190
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:46,460
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:13,030
[Episode 29]

31
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,970
Father Monarch!

32
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,960
Where did you go? Why didn't you bring Jia Yun with you?

33
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:32,290
You always talked about how Mother often got lost in the woods

34
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,900
and I thought it was interesting,

35
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,400
so I secretly went there today and I indeed got lost as well.

36
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,960
Father Monarch, I even bumped into a snake monster.

37
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,370
I almost got killed.

38
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:46,640
Good thing, this older sister saved me.

39
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,220
Don't run off on your own again.

40
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,000
Okay.

41
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:01,620
Thank you, Miss, for helping.

42
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,270
It's nothing.

43
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,200
May I ask, you are...?

44
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,420
His Mighty Monarch is the crown prince of the Heavenly Tribe, Ye Hua.

45
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,780
Your Highness the Crown Prince, I, Miao Qing, greet Your Highness.

46
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,510
No need for formalities.

47
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:19,140
My eldest brother is the Water Monarch of the Eastern Sea.

48
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,900
So, it's Princess Miao Qing.

49
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,000
You saved Ah Li today.

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,510
I will have to repay your kindness.

51
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:29,490
Do you have any wishes?

52
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,450
I've long admired Your Highness the Crown Prince's mighty name.

53
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,820
It's a good fortune worth three lifetimes to be able to see you today.

54
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,860
If you ask if I have any wishes,

55
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,630
I want to be by your side.

56
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,900
By my side?

57
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,410
You want to marry my father?

58
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,540
That's not it. Please don't be mistaken, Your Young Highness.

59
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:01,700
I know that I'm just a princess of the Eastern Sea and will not be able to enter Pure Wutong Palace.

60
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,410
I just want to live here in this thatched hut

61
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:10,260
and take care of you two when you visit.

62
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:15,610
Princess Miao Qing, doing that is not fit for your status.

63
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:18,800
Moreover, I need to return you a favor.

64
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,200
It's unreasonable to let you serve us.

65
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,250
This is my wish.

66
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,730
I hope you can grant me this.

67
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,410
Father Monarch.

68
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,080
Do you only have this wish?

69
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,940
Fine, you can do so for ten days.

70
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,480
After ten days, you must leave.

71
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,000
Your Mighty Monarch!

72
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,690
What is it?

73
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:54,120
I will obey your command.

74
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,950
Father Monarch, I don't like that older sister.

75
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,660
Don't let her stay here.

76
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,610
It's clear.. clear that she just wants to replace Mother.

77
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,170
That's enough.

78
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,290
Princess Miao Qing saved you.

79
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:17,040
I've promised to fulfill her one wish, so I can't go back on my words.

80
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:25,620
Father Monarch, you've said that Mother is coming back soon!

81
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,470
If you do this, Mother will get mad once she gets back!

82
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,550
That's enough!

83
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,870
Ah Li, your mother is not coming back.

84
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,870
Why? Didn't you say that as long as the light in the Soul Gathering-Lamp doesn't extinguish,

85
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,400
Mother will come back?

86
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,900
The Soul-Gathering Lamp's light has extinguished.

87
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,930
She won't come back anymore.

88
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:54,070
Why did it get extinguished? Did Tian Shu not take good care of it?

89
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,940
Enough! Leave!

90
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,680
Father Monarch!

91
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,030
Leave!

92
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,930
Your Highness, please appease your anger. Young Highness just misses his mother a lot.

93
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,850
You two immediately go follow him.

94
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,460
Just let him cry for a while.

95
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,030
Yes.

96
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,710
Young Heavenly Grandchild.

97
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,380
- Young Highness!
- Young Highness!

98
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,740
- Young Highness, slow down!
- What happened to Young Heavenly Grandchild?

99
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,890
He and His Highness had an argument. It's better that you don't go in.

100
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,610
His Highness is currently very mad. He doesn't want anyone to disturb him.

101
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,390
Young Highness!

102
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:44,850
Dragonfly, Father Monarch was just lying to me, right?

103
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:47,710
I've waited for Mother for 300 years.

104
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:51,350
Mother will surely come back, right?

105
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:55,450
What happened? Why did His Highness say that the light of the Soul-Gathering Lamp was extinguished?

106
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:00,080
It's all because that Bai Fengjiu of Green Hill was too mischievous.

107
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,490
She disguised as Consort Su Jin to steal the lamp causing its fire to get extinguished.

108
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:09,460
Think about it. She's the empress of Green Hill, the niece of Bai Qian, and she's close with Emperor Dong Hua.

109
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:13,130
Hence, His Highness couldn't do anything and had to let it go.

110
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:16,270
His Mighty Monarch and Young Heavenly Grandson have waited for 300 years.

111
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,480
Who cares if it's been 300 years?

112
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,160
To tell the truth, that light can only make a similar person.

113
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,330
She's not the real one.

114
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:27,780
There are benefits to it being extinguished, too.

115
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,600
- Aunt.
- Did you give it back?

116
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,350
I did.

117
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,950
Did the Heavenly Tribe blame you?

118
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,460
Third Highness helped me beg for leniency.

119
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,220
That's good. Your long stay in the Heavenly Palace didn't go in vain.

120
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,740
In a few days, I'll be going to the Eastern Sea.

121
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,690
On my way back, I'll visit Fourth Older Brother's manor.

122
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:14,970
Stay here in Green Hill obediently and don't cause any trouble.

123
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:17,380
Why are you going to the Eastern Sea?

124
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,580
Water Monarch of the Eastern Sea had a son.

125
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,900
He invited me to a banquet to celebrate it.

126
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,340
You never liked these events before.

127
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,850
How come Eastern Sea Water Monarch is so fortunate to be able to convince you to go?

128
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,850
I usually don't like these kinds of lively events,

129
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:40,370
but when Mother gave birth to me, it was a difficult labor.

130
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:44,920
It was all thanks to the help of Water Monarch's midwife that my mother suffered less.

131
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:51,440
Now that he has invited me for a celebratory event, I shouldn't be ungrateful. Right?

132
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,930
Mi Gu!

133
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:57,270
Young Highness, you're back! I thought you'd get locked in Heaven for 30 to 50 years.

134
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,470
It was all your stupid idea!

135
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,020
Great Lady, what is your order?

136
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:05,890
Go get me the largest luminous pearl in the pond.

137
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:08,240
You're gifting someone a present again?

138
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,790
You know it again?

139
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:13,340
Who in Green Hill doesn't know that you love gifting luminous pearls?

140
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:19,440
Based on the status of the immortal and your mood that day, you decide on the size of the pearl.

141
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,980
When Fox Emperor lived in this den, there were so many pearls in the pond.

142
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,680
Now, you can almost see the bottom.

143
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,480
- Stop talking and go get it.
- Okay.

144
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,000
My spendthrift Great Lady.

145
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,470
This Eastern Sea Water Monarch...

146
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:39,770
Just to prepare for his son's one-month-old celebration, that Eastern Sea Water Monarch

147
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:42,710
has been successively absent in the court meetings here in Rosy Cloud Hall.

148
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:45,020
That's right. Isn't it just a banquet?

149
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,980
Why make so much trouble in preparing for it?

150
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,720
My colleagues, don't you know yet?

151
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,160
Even the Great Lady from Green Hill will be at this Eastern Sea banquet.

152
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,280
This Great Lady has an eye disease and can't stand bright light,

153
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:04,230
but the glazed coral tile of his Dragon Palace is too lustrous and dazzling.

154
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:10,160
Hence, the Eastern Sea Water Monarch was busy looking for water lily leaves everywhere

155
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,540
to weave them into fabric for covering these excessively bright items.

156
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:23,070
Is the Great Lady that you mentioned High Goddess Bai Qian, the daughter of Emperor Bai Zhi?

157
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,000
Correct.

158
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:32,450
In the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses, only this one high goddess is worthy for us to call her Great Lady.

159
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:37,050
- Indeed.
- It's really not easy to be able to see Great Lady.

160
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:43,360
Hence, I've prepared my tribute: fresh flowers facial moisturizing cream.

161
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:49,410
It'd really be an honor if Great Lady likes it.

162
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,760
- Indeed.
- Isn't she

163
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,190
the High Goddess who's engaged to His Highness the Crown Prince?

164
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:58,950
Three hundred years ago, Heavenly Monarch personally set this marriage agreement.

165
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:02,910
I thought then that I'd be able to attend His Highness the Crown Prince's wedding banquet.

166
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:09,510
I never thought that during these 300 years, there was never any news about their wedding.

167
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,170
That's right. That's right.

168
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:15,480
Although His Highness has a son, the maid consort position is still empty.

169
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,630
Since High Goddess Bai Qian was born, she has always stayed in Green Hill.

170
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:22,630
She never accepted anyone's event invitations.

171
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,770
These two high gods have never seen each other.

172
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:28,300
Right!

173
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:33,350
Say, both are unmarried but both aren't rushing it.

174
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,650
Isn't that strange?

175
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:37,260
This...

176
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,340
It is indeed strange.

177
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,060
But the Eastern Sea Water Monarch is so fortunate.

178
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,110
Great Lady has never left Green Hill for tens of thousands of years.

179
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,770
And now, he was able to invite her.

180
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:48,970
It's really such a great honor for him.

181
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:51,770
It is indeed a reputation booster,

182
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:55,510
but I'm sure that Water Monarch must have been so anxious these past days.

183
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:59,950
He never expected that Great Lady would accept his invitation.

184
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,540
And he had previously invited the Northern Sea Water Monarch.

185
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:08,700
Yesterday, His Highness took Young Heavenly Grandchild to the Eastern Wilderness and will also attend the banquet in passing.

186
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,790
If the three of them bump into each other during the banquet...

187
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:17,330
The Eastern Sea Water Monarch is currently living in fear.

188
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:21,920
He doesn't know what trouble might happen during the banquet.

189
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,750
Who is that Great Lady from Green Hill?

190
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:31,240
Does she have any conflict with Ye Hua and the Northern Sea Water Monarch?

191
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,150
You're still young, so you probably don't know this.

192
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:38,450
Before the great war between the Heavenly Realm and Winged Realm,

193
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:43,090
Great Lady and the second son of Heavenly Monarch had an engagement.

194
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:46,590
It initially was a good marriage between two compatible people.

195
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:52,690
But for some reason, Sang Ji suddenly fell in love with Great Lady's maidservant

196
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:55,140
and insisted on canceling the engagement, regardless of the consequences.

197
00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:01,700
The Northern Sea Water Monarch was willing to offend Fox Emperor Bai Zhi just to marry to Great Lady's maidservant.

198
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,680
How beautiful is that maidservant?

199
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,470
I've seen that lady before.

200
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:12,680
Back then, Second Prince personally held her and knelt down in front of Heavenly Monarch,

201
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,040
asking that she be given a status.

202
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,470
She is indeed a beautiful lady.

203
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:23,710
But compared to the daughter of Emperor Bai Zhi, she's way inferior.

204
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:26,930
I have never seen that girl before,

205
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:30,690
but I heard that Great Lady looks similar to her mother.

206
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:35,210
She's even more beautiful than her mother.

207
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:39,380
I was fortunate to have seen Great Lady once.

208
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:44,010
That time, I was just a little boy serving under Heavenly Monarch.

209
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:47,960
I accompanied Heavenly Monarchess to admire the peach flowers in High God Zhe Yan's place.

210
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:52,690
I happened to see Great Lady dancing on top of the peach trees.

211
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:57,980
Because I was far, I could only see that luminous red dress in between those peach trees.

212
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:02,920
That scenery was so wonderful! So wonderful!

213
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:09,210
Even the marriage of a beauty like that would get called off.

214
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:12,910
It's so hard to predict the will of Heaven.

215
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,180
Indeed.

216
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:20,540
Maybe, because of that, Great Lady refuses to leave Green Hill.

217
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,200
It's really hard to predict the will of Heaven.

218
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,410
That's right.

219
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,460
You scared me.

220
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,800
You really can't bear for the world to be in peace.

221
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,040
You're everywhere.

222
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,340
Good thing I didn't marry you.

223
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:45,000
You want to marry me?

224
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,010
I won't agree to it.

225
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,400
Ah Li.

226
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,560
I've received an invitation from the Eastern Sea Water Monarch.

227
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,580
Do you want to go there and check it out?

228
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,060
I don't want to.

229
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,490
I'll go myself, then.

230
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:10,480
Are you leaving me here alone?

231
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,500
It's your choice.

232
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,650
Then I'll go.

233
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,840
Your Mighty Monarch, today is the tenth day.

234
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,700
You may leave.

235
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,430
Aren't you going to my eldest brother's Eastern Sea today?

236
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,880
- I can lead the way.
- No need.

237
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,650
I will take my leave.

238
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,040
Sit down.

239
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,060
Who are you?!

240
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:57,120
How dare you trespass into Green Hill?

241
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,650
This little brother, I'm Star Monarch Si Ming.

242
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:02,660
I came to visit the Young Highness of Green Hill, Bai Fengjiu.

243
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,750
- Si Ming?
- That's me, indeed.

244
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:14,990
Si Ming! I waited for you for so long I couldn't sleep. You're finally here.

245
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,550
- Young Highness.
- Let's go talk inside.

246
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,060
Young Highness! Young Highness!

247
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,210
Everything inside the valley is precious to Great Lady.

248
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:24,390
Outsiders are not allowed.

249
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,730
Especially Heavenly Tribe people.

250
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,010
I apologize, Star Monarch Si Ming.

251
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:35,270
There's a strict rule in the fox den against outsiders coming in.

252
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:38,790
It's okay. Since I'm here to fetch you to pay back your debt of gratitude,

253
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,340
it's fine if I go in or not.

254
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,490
It's just that you might need to go prepare.

255
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:45,420
You might be gone for two months.

256
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,110
- Two months?
- That's right.

257
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:08,650
Mi Gu.

258
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:13,110
Say, do you have any ideas on how I can avoid this Eastern Sea banquet?

259
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:15,580
You can't. Pay the money back if you borrow it.

260
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:18,100
If you owe another a favor, you then must return it with a favor.

261
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,670
No matter how great you are, you still have to pay it back.

262
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:25,760
You're acting strange. Who offended you?

263
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,780
Nothing.

264
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,070
I'm afraid that if Aunt hears about this, she won't let me go.

265
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:35,730
Wait a few days after I leave before telling her. Okay?

266
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,710
By the way,

267
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,140
where's my luminous pearl?

268
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,750
Right! The luminous pearl!

269
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:59,150
Great Lady, this is the biggest one in the pond.

270
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,320
Mi Gu, I want something from you.

271
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,200
What is it?

272
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,690
I want one of your buds.

273
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,530
The travel to the Eastern Sea is quite far.

274
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:25,790
If I get lost, I can rely on it to go back to the right path.

275
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:28,850
Right. My branch is able to point you in the right direction.

276
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:32,430
It is indeed suitable to a High Goddess like you, who always gets lost.

277
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,840
You're acting strange.

278
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,910
It's nothing. I'm always acting strange.

279
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,780
Great Lady, you're going to the Eastern Sea now?

280
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:56,450
Right. On my way back, I'll pass by my fourth older brother's place in the Northern Wilderness.

281
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:58,450
You and Fengjiu just watch over my den well.

282
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:00,940
Don't argue.

283
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,060
Fourth Uncle has indeed been in the Northern Wilderness lately.

284
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,300
He said his Bi Fang Bird threw a tantrum and went home.

285
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,190
He then went to look for it.

286
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,140
You believe that?

287
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:14,830
Fourth Older Brother would use that same excuse whenever Zhe Yan angers him.

288
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:17,460
Counting the times since I woke up 300 years ago,

289
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,200
that Bi Fang Bird has "escaped" more than ten times.

290
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,550
You are wise.

291
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:28,560
When will Young Highness stop repaying that kindness?

292
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:38,740
Long live, Your Majesty!

293
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,050
Rise.

294
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:42,620
Thank you, Your Majesty!

295
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,900
That is... Emperor?

296
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,560
Indeed

297
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:04,870
Did he do something wrong to offend the Heavenly Monarch, so he got demoted to the mortal world?

298
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,670
How is that possible?

299
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,760
He requested to undergo tribulations.

300
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,840
Tribulations?

301
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,910
Emperor wants to go through 60 years of tribulations here in the mortal world.

302
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:16,860
I thought that if you want to repay his kindness,

303
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,780
this is the best time.

304
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:22,090
How do I do that?

305
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:24,260
I already have a plan.

306
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,540
Why did you bring me here to the harem? Who's that?

307
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:46,600
Emperor wants to be an emperor here in the mortal world, so I arranged for you to be part of his harem.

308
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,180
That's the body you'll use to pay for his kindness.

309
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:53,810
This Noble Lady will fall into this pond later, suffer a cold, and get severely ill.

310
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:56,570
No medicine can cure her. She'll fall and break like a jade, wither like a flower.

311
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:59,060
You will then continue her story.

312
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:02,630
From then on, you'll be Noble Lady Chen.

313
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,230
She's so pitiful.

314
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,760
Not really.

315
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,570
Since she entered the palace and saw the emperor twice, she hasn't had any chance to attend to his bed again.

316
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:15,060
The earlier she's released from such a life in the palace, the better.

317
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:20,170
But if I become Noble Lady Chen, how would I repay my debt of gratitude?

318
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,260
Just act accordingly.

319
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:33,710
Hurry! It's exactly this moment! Hurry!

320
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:38,110
Help! Help!

321
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:41,740
Quickly pull! Quickly pull her up!

322
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,520
Pull harder.

323
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,470
Slow.

324
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:12,120
All are mediocre doctors. They just give one look, casually write us a prescription, and then brush us away.

325
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,780
Are they bullying Her Highness for not being favored?

326
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,200
Forget it.

327
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,170
Don't mind them.

328
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,750
You leave now.

329
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,450
I'm tired.

330
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:25,380
Yes.

331
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,220
Young Highness.

332
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:50,170
- You're here?
- I'm here to check if you're used to the rules here in the palace.

333
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:53,020
I've stayed in Early Dawn Palace. This place is more or less the same.

334
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:56,840
Moreover, I cough out blood every day, like what's written on the Book of Fate.

335
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,060
Hence, I don't really need to interact with anyone.

336
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:03,220
At the start of spring, your illness will be cured.

337
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:10,090
But that phoenix flower on your forehead is quite troublesome.

338
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:11,790
Is it very troublesome?

339
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,830
My aunt said that this was given by Heaven.

340
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,270
It's very beautiful.

341
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,620
Beautiful. It is beautiful.

342
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:22,720
It's just that Noble Lady Chen doesn't have that on her forehead.

343
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,450
I fear that people will speculate if one suddenly appeared.

344
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,710
Will they?

345
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:49,000
When will His Majesty see me?

346
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,320
The imperial doctor said that you're almost cured.

347
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,090
I've also reported it. Don't worry.

348
00:23:56,090 --> 00:24:00,230
Once His Majesty sees your name tablet, he will remember you.

349
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,870
Who is that?

350
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:14,690
That seems to be Noble Lady Chen.

351
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:16,430
Noble Lady Chen?

352
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:18,970
Right. It's Noble Lady Chen.

353
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:22,890
I heard that she fell into the water on the 12th lunar month and has been bedridden since.

354
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:25,170
She was able to get up from her bed only recently.

355
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:31,860
That Noble Lady Chen who was able to attend to His Majesty only twice since entering the palace?

356
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,810
Yes, Your Lady Highness.

357
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:52,820
- Greetings, Your Majesty Empress and Your Lady Highnesses.
- Greetings, Your Majesty Empress

358
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:56,550
- Get up.
- Thank you, Your Majesty Empress.

359
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,430
What kind of forehead makeup is that?

360
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:04,500
It's so dreadful.

361
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,920
Quickly wash it off.

362
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,990
I was born with this.

363
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:13,260
I don't remember such a thing on your forehead.

364
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:19,230
Your Majesty Empress, after getting sick, Her Highness developed a phoenix flower mark on her forehead.

365
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:21,280
Not even the imperial doctors know how it came about.

366
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,750
They said it might be a good omen.

367
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:28,490
How could an eyesore birthmark like that be good?

368
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:31,240
I feel uncomfortable just looking at it.

369
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:35,530
Your Majesty, in my opinion, that's a demonic flower.

370
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:38,550
How could it be a demonic flower? It clearly is my—

371
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:40,820
Clearly what?

372
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:46,040
Clearly a sign of me getting a second leash on life after my severe illness.

373
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:48,680
Your Majesty, listen to what Noble Lady Chen said.

374
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,430
I'm going to die laughing.

375
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:52,710
Who in the imperial harem has never been sick?

376
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:56,160
Only she is acting like she has been reborn and even had an additional mark.

377
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,900
Enough.

378
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,130
That thing on your forehead came in a strange manner.

379
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:05,690
I can only remove your name in the choice of consorts to attend to His Majesty's bedchamber,

380
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:10,210
to avoid him getting implicated if that happens to be some evil thing.

381
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:14,030
Yes.

382
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:30,280
She was clearly looking for an excuse to bar you from attending to His Majesty.

383
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,420
I can't even see the Emperor.

384
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,710
How would I repay my debt of gratitude?

385
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:38,620
Since I can't attend to him in his sleeping chamber, there's nothing wrong with a chance encounter. Right?

386
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:43,630
In those novels of Fourth Uncle, doesn't the emperor usually accidentally meet the love of his life?

387
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:47,820
The lower the status, the more he likes her.

388
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:54,870
Your Highness, why are you looking at me?

389
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:59,440
Yu Dang, prepare me a set of the palace maid clothing similar to what you're wearing.

390
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,100
Yes.

391
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,640
Emperor!

392
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,090
I don't know how his temperament is here in the mortal world.

393
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:29,740
Is he easy to get along with?

394
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:33,810
What should I say to make him remember me?

395
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:35,750
I shouldn't be like how I acted in the Heavenly Palace.

396
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,240
Right, I must act dignified.

397
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:41,110
I must have the noble air and bearing of an empress of Green Hill.

398
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,380
Your Majesty.

399
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:57,690
- Your Majesty.
- Empress.

400
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:00,150
Is Your Majesty going to...?

401
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:02,330
To visit Noble Consort.

402
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:07,000
I won't delay you then.

403
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:18,070
He just left like that?

404
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,720
Your Majesty Empress.

405
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:30,590
Noble Lady Chen,

406
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:35,300
why are you wearing a palace maid uniform?

407
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:58,750
Your Highness, did you see His Majesty?

408
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:02,160
It's okay if you didn't see him.

409
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,120
I've asked around for the schedule of His Majesty for the next few days.

410
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,370
We'll follow him and surely find a chance to see him.

411
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,520
Empress said that I'm not allowed to step foot out of Lotus Courtyard.

412
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:16,930
I won't be able to see His Majesty anymore.

413
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,880
You want my peaches?

414
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:30,040
Do you think just anyone can get the peaches of my Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms?

415
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,810
High God, you are quite right.

416
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:34,780
Because of my wife's pregnancy cravings,

417
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,830
she keeps asking for peaches.

418
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,270
But at this season,

419
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:40,430
peach flowers are in full bloom everywhere.

420
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:45,930
But in both Heaven and Earth, the peaches can only be found in your place.

421
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:50,260
Hence, I boldly ask you to bestow me some fresh fruit.

422
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:55,080
Not much, a few will be enough.

423
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,080
Since you're already boldly asking,

424
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,100
I mustn't make things too hard on the previous second prince like you.

425
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:10,270
After all, I'm your elder.

426
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,570
Fine. Come with me.

427
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:16,150
Thank you, High God.

428
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:19,370
Don't thank me. If you want to thank something, thank your identity.

429
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:23,200
I'm giving you a few peaches for the sake of your father.

430
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:32,290
In a day, Great Lady and Young Highness both left.

431
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:43,110
The fox den that has been lively for 300 years is cold and silent again.

432
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,320
It's really so quiet.

433
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,210
Still not giving up?

434
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:18,860
The Northern Sea Consort seeks an audience with Great Lady.

435
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:21,970
You come here more than ten times a year. Don't you get tired?

436
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:24,890
What? You aren't getting down from your carriage now?

437
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:26,760
Why put up this front?

438
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,420
Her Highness is pregnant.

439
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:31,220
It's inconvenient for her to move around.

440
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,220
Wait!

441
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,080
Go away. She won't see you.

442
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,260
Don't disturb me eating my nuts.

443
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:56,420
Your Highness, although Bai Qian of Green Hill is the well-respected high goddess,

444
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,940
our Northern Sea isn't that inferior to her.

445
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,620
Why must you keep asking to see her?

446
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:03,630
Three hundred years ago, I committed a mistake.

447
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,120
I have been guilty since.

448
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:10,310
Only after this knot in my heart is untied can I peacefully live my days.

449
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:12,500
I don't understand.

450
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,900
Your Highness, we still must attend the banquet in the Eastern Sea.

451
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,610
Let's go back now.

452
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:20,310
I'll come back here after the banquet.

453
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,880
Young Fifth, come sit.

454
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,710
Young Fifth.

455
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:49,550
A few days ago, the Northern Sea Water Monarch and his wife came here to view my peach blossoms.

456
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,640
Because of his wife's pregnancy cravings,

457
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:54,070
she keeps asking for peaches.

458
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:59,560
You also know that in this season, in both Heaven and Earth, only I have peaches.

459
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,690
Since he shamelessly asked me for them,

460
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:04,300
I couldn't really reject him. Right?

461
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:07,920
You own this peach forest and the fruit inside it.

462
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,290
- No need to explain anything to me.
- Look at you.

463
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:12,560
You're green from anger.

464
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,090
It's just a few contraceptive peaches.

465
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:17,110
You gave them contraceptive peaches?!

466
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,650
Why?

467
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:23,350
You are embarrassed that I gave that sweet couple some contraceptive peaches?

468
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,750
Don't worry.

469
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:31,130
That contraceptive peach will only temporarily prevent the Northern Sea Water Monarch from having a fifth child for a few thousand years.

470
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:35,660
It won't reduce many blessings for him, nor increase much bad karma on me.

471
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:40,840
Actually, whether he has a fifth child or not is none of my business.

472
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,730
Why then do you keep holding a grudge against them?

473
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:49,000
What I'm annoyed with is if that Sang Ji didn't cancel our engagement,

474
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,060
those troubles that came afterward wouldn't have happened.

475
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:57,200
Without me knowing, you and my father even set another engagement for me.

476
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:02,240
It's been 300 years since and the situation has become more awkward.

477
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,710
Indeed. That family of the Heavenly Monarch just loves to say flowery words.

478
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:10,990
He's not even coming to me or your father to discuss your wedding date.

479
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:17,190
Now, Ye Hua has married a side consort, Su Jin, whom he favors greatly and he also has a son.

480
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:20,690
He must be even less interested in thinking about your wedding.

481
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:24,150
But delaying this isn't the answer.

482
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:26,050
After Heavenly Monarch announced the wedding,

483
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:31,020
even if someone is interested in marrying you, they wouldn't dare offend the Heavenly Tribe.

484
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:34,410
Good thing, I'm not in a rush to marry.

485
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:36,050
That's not the point.

486
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:40,380
If this gets dragged further, you might become the laughingstock of Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses again.

487
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:46,480
No, I must find time to discuss this with your parents.

488
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,990
In terms of seniority, he should call me aunt.

489
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:53,880
In terms of age, he should call me an ancestor.

490
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:58,220
I can't bear to be heartless and force myself to proceed with this marriage.

491
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,720
Forget it, forget it.

492
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:03,070
Let's not talk about those bastards in the Heavenly Tribe.

493
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:06,280
The Eastern Sea birthday banquet will start tomorrow.

494
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,220
Just rest here for the night and go down to the sea tomorrow.

495
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,260
I indeed had such a plan.

496
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:14,820
Oh, your fourth older brother asked me to especially make him two jars of wine.

497
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,380
I buried it under that tree beside the Green Jade Pond.

498
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,750
Before you leave, dig it out.

499
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,610
Take it to your fourth older brother.

500
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:26,190
Remember, don't spill it nor secretly drink it.

501
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:29,170
What kind of wine are you not letting me drink? So petty.

502
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:33,890
That wine of yours isn't even enough to fill up my little jade bottle.

503
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:37,370
You really can't drink that wine.

504
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:40,010
If you want to drink it, just get some from my Pure Yang Cave.

505
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:41,910
You can get as many as you can take with you.

506
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:46,100
Okay. I will listen to everything you say, High God.

507
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:26,570
This little hut is exposed to the wind, rain, and the sun, yet is still standing erect here and has been maintained so clean.

508
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:29,650
Zhe Yan is really so meticulous.

509
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:36,420
Hey, why don't I use this to dig those two peach blossoms wine he made?

510
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,410
It's really just right for the task.

511
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:05,210
I must still secretly drink this peach blossoms wine,

512
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:09,190
and also move those wines in your wine cellar in Pure Yang Cave.

513
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:11,160
Not one less.

514
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,310
What medicinal skills?

515
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:25,330
Making wines is the true expertise of Zhe Yan.

516
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:43,990
Your Highness the Crown Prince,

517
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:47,240
to reach the Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms of High God Zhe Yan from our Eastern Sea,

518
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,300
you just need to go up to the shore.

519
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:54,820
Father Monarch, is Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms the lodging

520
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:58,780
of that mysterious High God who has retired from the Three Realms, not asking about the mundane world,

521
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:03,850
has very refined interest, and has a taste that's more refined than his interests?

522
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:07,310
In terms of age, you should be calling him "old ancestor."

523
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:10,010
Are we going to visit Old Ancestor?

524
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:11,350
You should go to sleep now.

525
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:14,000
Then, please come back soon, Father Monarch.

526
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,260
If you get used to not going back to your bedchamber at night,

527
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:19,240
Mother will be hurt.

528
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:25,320
Ah Li, did I tell you your mother wouldn't come back?

529
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:29,240
I understand. I'll listen to everything you say.

530
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:33,660
But I have a feeling about this.

531
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:36,620
Mother will come back.

532
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:53,500
Take Young Highness to go to sleep.

533
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,320
Yes.

534
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:12,360
Quickly, check if everything has been covered with water lily leaves.

535
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,420
Great Lady's eyes aren't well.

536
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,960
Don't let any dazzling light show.

537
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,940
Yes.

538
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,260
Younger Sister.

539
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,640
Why are you waiting here?

540
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,560
I want to see His Highness the Crown Prince.

541
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,280
His Highness the Crown Prince?

542
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,140
You actually know him, too?

543
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:42,930
I saved his son a few days ago.

544
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:46,160
And coincidentally, I met His Highness the Crown Prince.

545
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:50,730
Afterward, I used the excuse of saving his life to make a request.

546
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:53,510
I attended to His Highness the Crown Prince in that little hut for ten days.

547
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:55,490
What a coincidence.

548
00:39:56,310 --> 00:40:01,450
Don't tell me you've fallen in love with him, Younger Sister.

549
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,870
You must think about it well.

550
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:10,750
That Pure Wutong Palace isn't a place that anyone can stay.

551
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,890
The main consort is Bai Qian of Green Hill.

552
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:17,130
The side consort is Su Jin, a Heavenly Consort previously highly favored by Heavenly Monarch.

553
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:21,900
With those two around, what position can you have in that palace?

554
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,840
His Highness the Crown Prince will be the future Heavenly Monarch.

555
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,760
How could he have only two consorts in his harem?

556
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,240
Moreover, I just want to be by his side.

557
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,230
I'm willing to be a maid, too.

558
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:36,620
Have you thought this through?

559
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:42,530
I heard that several hundreds of years ago, when the merpeople revolted,

560
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:47,020
Princess Lü Xiu of Long Sea also fell in love with His Highness the Crown Prince at first sight.

561
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,660
But in the end, she didn't even get a chance to approach him.

562
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:52,750
You are prettier than Lü Xiu,

563
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:55,410
and you even saved Young Heavenly Grandchild.

564
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:57,280
It would indeed be easier for you.

565
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,570
Let me give it some thought.

566
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:09,540
I have an idea.

567
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,530
What is it?

568
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:15,160
Tomorrow, after your dance during the banquet,

569
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:18,150
I'll earnestly ask His Highness the Crown Prince to meet with you.

570
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:22,000
Tell him that I'm forcing you to marry the second prince of the Western Sea.

571
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,320
Then, I"ll describe that second prince of the Western Sea as some hedonistic lad.

572
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,070
Try hard to beg him.

573
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:29,320
With the fact that you've saved Young Heavenly Grandchild,

574
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:33,660
I think His Highness the Crown Prince would not just watch you getting forced like that.

575
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:37,820
Become his maidservant first, then think of a way to enchant him.

576
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,010
This is a tribute item: Fresh Flowers Facial Moisturizing Cream.

577
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:47,860
Tomorrow, if you can get the attention of everyone,

578
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:52,750
maybe you'll successfully earn the right to stay by the side of His Highness the Crown Prince.

579
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:55,170
Thank you, Older Brother.

♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

586
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:20,230
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

587
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:25,900
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

♫ All are just illusions ♫

♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

594
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:05,710
