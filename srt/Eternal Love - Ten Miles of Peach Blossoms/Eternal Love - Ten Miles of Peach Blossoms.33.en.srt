00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,490
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,080
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,630
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,180
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,440
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,200
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,820
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,300
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,830
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:49,460
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,950
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:56,410
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:00,040
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,570
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,040
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,520
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,070
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,040
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,820
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,250
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,810
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,030
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,830
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,410
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:38,880
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,000
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,980
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

[Episode 33]

31
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:17,350
The person in the front shouted, "It's bad."

32
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:23,400
If you want to know what happened, listen to the next chapter.

33
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,810
Okay. I'm leaving.

34
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,210
Customers, take care. Come back next time.

35
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:34,060
- Where's Ah Li?
- Hurry. Hurry.

36
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,820
Where's Ah Li?

37
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,220
Why did he go to a brothel?

38
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:07,110
Brother, do you know where the brothel nearby is?

39
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,390
It's that building over there.

40
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,400
Thank you.

41
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:18,600
Who knew such a good looking man could be a pervert?

42
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,670
What kind of desperate and painful world is this?

43
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,300
The storyteller is not bad.

44
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,050
When you first hear it, it sounds interesting.

45
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:52,810
But after listening, why did you follow them to the brothel?

46
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:57,730
Just now, a fatty wanted to kiss a lady in the public.

47
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,450
But the lady wouldn't let the fatty kiss her.

48
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,900
The fatty got really mad because he didn't get it.

49
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:08,110
He beckoned a few ugly weirdos who were with him and surrounded her.

50
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:12,560
I ran downstairs to save her, but there weren't any signs of them.

51
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,910
An uncle nearby told me he went to a Flower Building.
(T/N: A Flower Building actually means a brothel.)

52
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:22,560
I went all over the building but didn't see any flowers.

53
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,420
This is a mortal saying.

54
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:29,180
Don't worry about it too much.

55
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,270
Then I couldn't find that fatty.

56
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:35,750
I searched all over and didn't find him, so I went into a room.

57
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:40,650
I didn't see if the person inside was a man or woman when you came.

58
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:44,400
This is our secret.

59
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,530
Don't tell your Father Monarch, all right?

60
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:49,190
I understand.

61
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:05,030
In ten minutes, I will return to discuss this matter in detail with you.

62
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,280
Your Highness, take care.

63
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,820
Your Highness.

64
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,580
I heard His Mighty Monarch is back.

65
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:41,050
He did but he just left.

66
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,930
He left again?

67
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:48,050
The Great Lady from Green Hill is playing in the Mortal Realm, so His Mighty Monarch is accompanying her.

68
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,860
She's playing in the Mortal Realm?

69
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:55,180
Doesn't that mean he'll miss the Heavenly Monarch's birthday banquet?

70
00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:00,360
You don't have to worry about that. His Mighty Monarch has said that he'll definitely be there.

71
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,460
That's good.

72
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,050
I was just worried that if His Mighty Monarch stays too long in the Green Hill,

73
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:11,080
he would miss the birthday banquet of Heavenly Monarch.

74
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,850
Since he will return, that puts me at ease.

75
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:20,120
Don't worry. His Mighty Monarch will be in the main hall soon.

76
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,310
Okay. I understand.

77
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,570
Young sir, you are very fine-looking.

78
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,470
I really admire you.

79
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,620
You flatter me.

80
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,630
Your hands are also so soft and white.

81
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:01,140
I fell in love with you at first sight.

82
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,460
I wonder if you...

83
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,380
It hurts, it hurts.

84
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,860
You seem to be having fun teasing my wife.

85
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,070
You're back?

86
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:16,420
Able to make my father angry, you are quite a talent, too.

87
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,370
Let's not meet again. Take care.

88
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:22,880
How dare you! Do you know who I am?

89
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,650
- Where did you teleport him?
- No idea, either.

90
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,390
If you didn't come just now, I was planning to do the same.

91
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:39,320
He was being frivolous with you. Why didn't you avoid it?

92
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,810
He just touched me a little.

93
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:31,000
It was just a kiss.

94
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,040
Buy some lanterns, young sirs.

95
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,310
Buy some lanterns.

96
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,290
Gentlemen, come take a look.

97
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:58,000
Mortals pray to immortals when they buy lanterns.

98
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,910
If we buy them, who are we praying to?

99
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:05,740
Just as a souvenir. Did you really think that lanterns can resolve your problems?

100
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,300
Let's go.

101
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:15,140
Since you're both men, sharing a room shouldn't be a problem.

102
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,380
There are only three inns in this small town.

103
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:20,150
Owner Wang and Owner Li's inns were already fully occupied yesterday.

104
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,260
A guest just withdrew from our inn.

105
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,020
This is the only vacant room.

106
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,180
Do you... want to stay here for a night first?

107
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,920
Please bring us some hot water.

108
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,870
Yes.

109
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:37,300
And bring us some small dishes while you're at it.

110
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,310
Yes.

111
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:59,110
If you can't eat, why don't you go to sleep?

112
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,710
I have always known your temper.

113
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:59,960
I didn't expect you to be so firm.

114
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:04,980
If you've forgotten the past, then let it be.

115
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:08,210
I hope that you will remember

116
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:13,080
and also hope that you won't ever remember.

117
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,090
Your Mighty Monarch.

118
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,740
No need to chase them.

119
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,240
I neglected my duty. Please forgive me.

120
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,060
No matter.

121
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,370
These people would dare attack people from the Heavenly Tribe.

122
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,480
Don't you plan to go after them?

123
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,180
They aren't real people.

124
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,960
They're puppets created by black magic and especially for killing.

125
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:02,250
Even if you kill them, they'll only disappear. You can't ask them anything.

126
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:06,700
Black magic? Who wants to be enemies with the Heavenly Tribe?

127
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,670
High Immortal Die Feng just said that

128
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:13,670
all the guests who left the Water Monarch's banquet were also ambushed by them.

129
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,610
I'm preparing to investigate this.

130
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,950
Your Mighty Monarch, the Heavenly Monarch's birthday banquet will be starting soon.

131
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:22,860
I know. You return first.

132
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,950
Yes.

133
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:38,180
[South Gate Stage Station]

134
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,870
Mother! Mother! This porridge is really thick.

135
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,660
Good boy.

136
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:54,650
This place's food is unappetizing,

137
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:57,960
so I borrowed their kitchen to cook.

138
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:03,750
No wonder. I thought that this porridge was the same as the one you cooked before.

139
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,330
In the past when I was at Junji Mountain,

140
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:11,500
I also couldn't get used to the food that the Eastern Sea princess cooked for me.

141
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:16,380
But Father Monarch never personally cooked for me.

142
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:22,150
I have some matters to attend to and need to go back to the Heavenly Palace.

143
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,980
Father Monarch, you need to go?

144
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,750
Cheng Yu said that absence makes the heart grow fonder.

145
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:30,670
You and Mother have been apart for 300 years.

146
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:33,700
You are still willing to separate?

147
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,350
Did you forget what today is?

148
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,960
What day is it?

149
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,370
Let me think about it.

150
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:42,140
What day is it?

151
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:45,610
- It's Heavenly Monarch's birthday!
- That's right.

152
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:49,560
Do you need to bring me and Mother to celebrate?

153
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,610
Celebrate?

154
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,020
Your mother doesn't really like to go to these kinds of events.

155
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,700
I can go alone.

156
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,620
Okay!

157
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,870
Don't worry. You just go with ease.

158
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:04,220
I'll take Mochi back.

159
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:13,610
Great Lady, you returned!

160
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,910
Where's His Highness the Crown Prince?

161
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:20,140
He went back to the Heavenly Palace. He has a few things to take care of for a few days.

162
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:23,120
Doesn't that mean there won't be anyone to cook?

163
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:30,710
We'll go to the marketplace this afternoon and buy some loquats.

164
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:48,920
You indeed are punctual.

165
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,430
Ten minutes is ten minutes.

166
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:55,010
Just now in the Mortal Realm, I also ran into those people you spoke of.

167
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:57,290
Your Highness also ran into them?

168
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,580
How could they dare attack Your Highness?

169
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,150
It wasn't against me.

170
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,190
They just want an immortal's life.

171
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:07,010
Then they ran into my guard Tian Shu.

172
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:10,650
Did you leave any survivors?

173
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,040
It's useless to spare one.

174
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,320
Those people were controlled by black magic.

175
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,650
That's right. It's black magic.

176
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,940
These people are from the Winged Realm.

177
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,320
But the Winged Realm has an alliance with the Heavenly Tribe.

178
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,960
Why would they do this all of a sudden?

179
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,180
Let's suppress this matter for now.

180
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:32,620
First, let's find the identities of the immortals that are being chased.

181
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,650
Yes.

182
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,150
Your Highness.

183
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,600
- His Mighty Monarch is back?
- He's back.

184
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,560
His Highness the Crown Prince is back.

185
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,110
Did Bai Qian of Green Hill return with him?

186
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,760
I saw it very clearly,

187
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,740
His Highness the Crown Prince returned alone.

188
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:25,440
When he returned, he went to Purple Morning Hall to talk to the second prince of the Western Seas.

189
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,130
He hasn't gone to the birthday banquet yet.

190
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,950
Good.

191
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:33,950
It's best that she didn't come.

192
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:38,980
This way, I can ensure that I can keep Ye Hua here tonight.

193
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,800
Your Highness, I'm afraid...

194
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,680
Don't be scared.

195
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:49,110
The Heavenly Monarch has always hated that little Bashe snake.

196
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:53,160
He doesn't even like her son Yuan Zhen.

197
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,450
They have finally reconciled a little these years.

198
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,420
Supposing that...

199
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,860
Yuan Zhen takes advantage of me,

200
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:08,070
Heavenly Monarch definitely won't forgive him.

201
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,900
So you don't need to be afraid.

202
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,800
I'm very important to the Heavenly Monarch.

203
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:18,310
Even if he doesn't consider the fact that he cared for me growing up,

204
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:23,590
he will take into account the sub-tribe chieftains and seek justice for me.

205
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,870
I am Ye Hua's side consort.

206
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:29,410
If I'm being molested by his cousin,

207
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:32,870
no matter what, it's a big problem.

208
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:38,310
Ye Hua will surely stay here in the Heavenly Palace for a few days.

209
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,280
For today's plan,

210
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,550
what's most important is to retain him in the Heavenly Palace.

211
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:48,350
Stop him from going to Green Hill to be charmed by that Nine-Tailed Fox.

212
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:55,660
You go prepare here.

213
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,360
I'll go look for Yuan Zhen.

214
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,400
I'll find a way to bring him here.

215
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,850
Yes, Your Highness

216
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,330
- Is that the Northern Sea Monarch's eldest son?
- That's right.

217
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,990
Look at how pitiful he is.

218
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:24,140
He has to wait here instead of going to greet him, even though he's the Heavenly Monarch's grandson.

219
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,710
Who let the Northern Sea Water Monarch marry that Bashe snake?

220
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,600
Exactly.

221
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:42,210
Who are you? Did you need me to help with something?

222
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:45,060
You should call me Consort Su Jin.

223
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,650
So, it's Consort Su Jin.

224
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:50,510
Greetings, Consort Su Jin.

225
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:54,160
Based on seniority, I'm your older sister-in-law.

226
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,060
You don't need to be so formal.

227
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,760
Don't listen to those maids.

228
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,960
So what if you live long?

229
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,190
What's important is that you're with the one you love.

230
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:12,090
I envy your parents' relationship.

231
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:14,230
You are right.

232
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:19,920
Oh that's right, why are you here alone?

233
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:24,120
My Father Monarch went to go greet Heavenly Monarch and told me to wait here until I'm summoned.

234
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,360
Is that right?

235
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,730
Why don't I bring you in?

236
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:34,370
How can I do that? I can't just go in without being summoned.

237
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:37,860
It's okay. He's your grandfather after all.

238
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,530
Besides, Heavenly Monarch has been praising you these last few days.

239
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:43,550
He said that you wrote the congratulations messages very well.

240
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,370
Really?

241
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:47,400
Come, follow me.

242
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,290
Heavenly Monarch is now at Pure Wutong Palace.

243
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:51,240
I'll take you there.

244
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:18,760
Your Highness, this place is...?

245
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:49,290
Go now. Carry him up there.

246
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,480
Yes.

247
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,920
Go now.

248
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,980
Take a white silk and hang it on the beam.

249
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,970
Yes.

250
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:40,920
Go now and scream that I was molested by the drunken Young Highness and I wanted to hang myself.

251
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,120
Yes.

252
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,520
Someone, help!

253
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,940
Her Highness was molested by the drunken Young Highness.

254
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,930
She is trying to hang herself.

255
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:54,860
Someone, come quick!

256
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,530
Someone, come quick!

257
00:21:56,530 --> 00:22:00,300
Her Highness has hung herself!

258
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:04,140
Someone, help!

259
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,610
- Crown Prince.
- Second Uncle.

260
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:14,260
I heard that you've been living in the Green Hill lately.

261
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,700
The wedding must be coming soon.

262
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:22,030
I heard from Shao Xin that the woman next to you at the Eastern Sea was High Goddess Bai Qian.

263
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:24,450
At first, I thought she was joking.

264
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:27,020
I didn't expect it to be true.

265
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:30,290
I heard from Third Uncle that you are here for Heavenly Monarch's birthday banquet.

266
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,120
You even brought your eldest son, Yuan Zhen.

267
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,830
That's right.

268
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:37,560
Just now, Father Monarch even praised his intelligence.

269
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:45,000
It's a pity that no matter how smart, he's just the Northern Sea Water Monarch's son.

270
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:50,900
I fear he has no affinity with Nine Heavens.

271
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,230
Ye Hua. Second Older Brother. Hurry to Pure Wutong Palace.

272
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:56,130
Something happened with Yuan Zhen!

273
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:57,990
What?

274
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,680
- Father Monarch.
- Heavenly Monarch.

275
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,510
Rise.

276
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,910
- Thank you, Father Monarch.
- Thank you, Heavenly Monarch.

277
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:58,110
You taught your son to be like you.

278
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:00,400
Lost in lust.

279
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:05,040
Yuan Zhen, what exactly did you do?

280
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,680
Father Monarch, I didn't do anything!

281
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,530
I didn't do anything!

282
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,510
He trespassed into my bed chamber.

283
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,810
I almost...

284
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:21,780
I almost lost my chastity to him.

285
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:34,170
I disappointed your previous grace, Your Mighty Monarch.

286
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:40,870
I beg you for a piece of white silk to let me die an innocent death.

287
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:58,510
Heavenly Monarch and Your Mighty Monarch, I'm begging you to let me die.

288
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:06,470
You little scoundrel!

289
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:08,820
You beast!

290
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:22,010
Yuan Zhen wasn't sensible and did something so ugly to Side Consort Su Jin.

291
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:28,270
But I beg you to consider his youth and spare him!

292
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:35,210
I'm begging you to spare his life and punish him leniently.

293
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:49,120
Although Su Jin resisted strongly,

294
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,510
her chastity wasn't destroyed.

295
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:57,060
If he was someone else's son, I would have punished him with leniency,

296
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,450
but he's your son!

297
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,000
Among my three sons,

298
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:08,610
I doted on you the most.

299
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:14,110
It is also you that hurt me the most.

300
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:16,670
Who would've thought that today,

301
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:19,700
it would be your son who hurt me.

302
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:25,160
I didn't expect that, after countless years,

303
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,360
when I allowed you to bring your son to Heavenly Palace for the first time,

304
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:38,490
my own grandson would actually cause me to lose face in front of all my subjects during the banquet.

305
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:40,960
I admit my mistake.

306
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,900
Father Monarch, please don't be angry.

307
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:47,240
Yuan Zhen.

308
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:54,170
You are so young, yet you could even make such a mistake.

309
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:57,750
You forced me to re-examine you.

310
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:03,380
I previously thought that you had a kind disposition.

311
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,860
Heavenly Monarch, please investigate wisely.

312
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,820
I really didn't do anything.

313
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,780
Consort Su Jin wanted me to come here.

314
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:11,170
I really didn't do anything.

315
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:14,550
- I'm begging you to investigate this wisely...
- You scoundrel!

316
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:19,170
Which woman would frame others to destroy her chastity?

317
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:22,660
You are still quibbling at this moment?!

318
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,360
Men.

319
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:38,040
- Heavenly Monarch.
- Tie Yuan Zhen up with immortal locks.

320
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:41,080
Send him to the Mortal Realm to suffer tribulations for 60 years.

321
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,300
Afterward, relist him in the immortal ranks.

322
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,360
Yes.

323
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,450
No...

324
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,390
No. Father Monarch! Save me!

325
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:57,560
Father Monarch! Father Monarch!

326
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,750
- I really didn't do anything!
- Please retract your decree!

327
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:03,040
- I really didn't do anything!
- Yuan Zhen is a gentle soul by nature.

328
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,830
He doesn't lust after women!

329
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,890
No one knows a son better than his father.

330
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:09,570
He wouldn't do such a thing!

331
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:11,630
Please investigate, Father Monarch!

332
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:15,200
- Please investigate, Father Monarch!
- Father Monarch, save me.

333
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:21,710
I once thought you were a gentle soul and didn't lust after women.

334
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,910
But you also did such a shameful thing!

335
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,030
Take him away!

336
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:35,930
- No! No! Father Monarch, help me!
- Yuan Zhen!

337
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:39,030
Father Monarch, help me!

338
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,980
Father Monarch!

339
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:44,620
Father Monarch! I really didn't do anything!

340
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:57,300
This child fell asleep so fast.

341
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:02,150
Ye Hua is lucky to have a son like you.

342
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:14,700
I beg Your Mighty Monarch to grant me death to prove my innocence.

343
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:19,120
Your Mighty Monarch!

344
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:29,140
What was that act of yours today?

345
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:33,500
What do you mean, Your Mighty Monarch?

346
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:40,440
Don't tell me... Don't tell me that you think I tarnished myself?

347
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,910
Which woman would do that to herself?

348
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:46,820
And I only love Your Mighty Monarch.

349
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,550
Don't Your Mighty Monarch know that?!

350
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:54,030
You framed Su Su the same way back then.

351
00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:00,990
Do you think I couldn't see through your act?

352
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:04,020
You've wronged me!

353
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,660
Do you know why I kept you alive?

354
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:18,220
1. Because of the Soul-Gathering Lamp.

355
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,850
I spared your life because of that lamp.

356
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,780
2.

357
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:29,650
Because you have Su Su's eyes.

358
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:37,460
Once you're dead, Su Su's eyes will be dead, too.

359
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,580
But...

360
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:46,860
if you keep digging your own grave with these acts,

361
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:50,060
don't blame me for having no mercy.

362
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:54,240
Su Jin, even if you are dead,

363
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,610
I can find a new owner for this pair of eyes.

364
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:04,850
Your Mighty Monarch! Your Mighty Monarch!

365
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:17,340
Is the love I have for you by staying by your side for all these years really worth nothing to you?

366
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,070
That's right.

367
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:23,860
It means nothing.

368
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:52,170
- I think...
- Su Jin planned it.

369
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:54,940
Heavenly Monarch went along with it to bring down Second Uncle.

370
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:59,320
You're getting good at reading other people's intents.

371
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:03,680
It's a shame Yuan Zhen has bad luck.

372
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,430
Second Older Brother wasn't careful, either.

373
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:09,130
That year, Father Monarch demoted him to the Northern Sea because of that Bashe snake.

374
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:13,220
His relationship with his wife is getting stronger, and they are going to have a fourth child soon.

375
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:17,510
Isn't he embarrassing Father Monarch in front of the entire Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses?

376
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:20,800
Yuan Zhen has suffered for his parents.

377
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,560
It's fine, too.

378
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:29,500
I will go and advise Second Older Brother later to reel in his actions.

379
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,960
Kindness and love must be hidden.

380
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,690
If Father Monarch doesn't have face, he won't have a peaceful life, either.

381
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:49,510
Is there something you're not telling me, Third Uncle?

382
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,860
I just think it's strange.

383
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:54,680
Since you know Su Su is Bai Qian,

384
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,500
why don't you just bring her here to Heavenly Palace?

385
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,360
She's engaged to you.

386
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:06,890
Didn't I tell you she has completely forgotten about me ?

387
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:09,640
She really did?

388
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:15,210
Then, it must be High God Zhe Yan's love-forgetting medicine.

389
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:18,010
Looks like she remembered that you dug out her eyes.

390
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:21,060
That's why she totally erased you from her mind.

391
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:31,310
What do you plan on doing now that you're living in Green Hill?

392
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:47,340
I want to start over with her.

393
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:51,110
Start over?

394
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:58,810
She didn't have a single good memory of the Heavenly Palace as Su Su.

395
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:03,780
Since that's the case,

396
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:07,130
it's fine if she forgets.

397
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:15,920
I just need to take it slow and make her fall in love with me.

398
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:28,450
There won't be any barriers this time in marrying her.

399
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:31,190
That's good, too.

400
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:33,430
That's for the best.

401
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:06,030
Noble Lady, the wind has picked up.

402
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:08,080
You should go back inside.

403
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:13,740
It's been two years and His Majesty still hasn't visited me.

404
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:17,160
Everyone in the palace has heard about the rumor that the evildoers spread about you.

405
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,740
They say that the flower on your forehead is a demonic flower.

406
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:24,590
It's natural that His Majesty wouldn't visit after hearing about it.

407
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:33,800
So it's about the birthmark.

408
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,640
Aunt loves this birthmark the most.

409
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:43,650
Noble Lady, you don't need to be sad.

410
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:46,220
Rumors will eventually go away.

411
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:50,330
You're still young. You'll eventually gain his favor.

412
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:54,270
But if I don't see him,

413
00:35:54,270 --> 00:36:00,510
how can I give him my heart to fulfill his wish?

414
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,530
Your Majesty.

415
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:31,200
Sit down.

416
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:34,390
I don't dare.

417
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:36,520
I'm allowing you to sit.

418
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:38,910
Yes.

419
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:49,750
In the end, Noble Consort was unwilling to return to the palace.

420
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:52,580
Noble Consort?

421
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:58,730
I've doted on Noble Consort since she joined the palace at the age of 15.

422
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:01,840
I didn't imagine that after giving birth to Crown Prince Yuanzhen,

423
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,440
she would want to become a nun.

424
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:08,100
I couldn't do anything.

425
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:12,640
I could only build her a Daoist temple in the mountains behind the imperial city

426
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,300
for her to devote herself to cultivation.

427
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:20,560
She seems very devoted to the Daoist study.

428
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:27,960
She lived in the Daoist temple with Yuanzhen till he turned sixteen years old

429
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:34,770
before she sent a Daoist nun to send Yuanzhen back to the palace.

430
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:41,610
She will only return on the first and fifteenth day of the month to visit her son.

431
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:44,770
She never meets with me.

432
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:49,800
She has never been willing to see me.

433
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,100
It is as if I don't exist.

434
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:59,970
Si Ming said that Emperor entering the Mortal Realm is to experience the six pains of life.

435
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:05,340
From the look of this, Si Ming really put a lot of effort to write this story.

436
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:10,310
Isn't he afraid the Emperor will get mad at how much suffering he experienced in the Mortal Realm

437
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:12,980
and send him down here to have a taste of it himself?

438
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:15,370
Why aren't you saying anything?

439
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,510
I was...

440
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:25,410
I was feeling your pain.

441
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:28,820
Noble Consort didn't treasure how much you doted on her.

442
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:31,610
She not only wasted your sincerity to her,

443
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:34,700
but also wronged the women in the palace who admire you.

444
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:37,270
Do you love me, too?

445
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:42,780
I'm your consort so, of course, I do.

446
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:49,220
I'm willing to take out my own heart for you to see who is in my heart.

447
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:53,050
You're good at sweet words.

448
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,840
Your Majesty smiled.

449
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:59,200
Smiling is good.

450
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,550
You can forget things faster if you smile.

451
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:05,970
My aunt said that time brings great changes to the world.

452
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:09,680
No matter who you are, you will eventually turn into a speck of dust,

453
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,790
so is there a need to think so much to make it hard for yourself?

454
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:17,770
That makes sense.

455
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:27,530
This flower... is very beautiful.

456
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:35,270
I don't know why every time I see this flower I keep finding it familiar.

457
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:39,710
Your Majesty... remembers this birthmark?

458
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,730
I don't know.

459
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:44,040
I just want to keep looking at it.

460
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,660
I don't want to look at anything else.

461
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:50,600
I also thought that it was strange,

462
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:55,650
and I thought that I had been affected by your witchcraft.

463
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:58,340
Hence, I have been avoiding you for the past two years.

464
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:05,920
I was afraid I'd keep looking for the rest of my life and never be able to let go.

465
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:14,370
Your Majesty, your tea is finished.

466
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,800
I'll go pour you another.

467
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:39,730
Why couldn't I say any sweet words?

468
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,490
I can't be like this.

469
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:49,960
I got it.

470
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,130
Two curses.

471
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:58,360
Mother, when is Father Monarch coming back?

472
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:02,840
I want to eat steamed mushrooms and eat cabbage and radish soup.

473
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,060
It should be soon.

474
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,770
Father Monarch, you're back!

475
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:09,650
You're back?

476
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:20,240
Didn't I tell you Ah Li is growing so he can't keep eating this?

477
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,770
I know.

478
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:25,840
That's why we were looking forward to you coming back to make food.

479
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:32,570
Were you really waiting for me to return?

480
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:39,000
Father Monarch! Mother's face is red.

481
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,360
I was just looking forward to your food.

”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

483
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:20,050
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

484
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:22,710
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

485
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:27,900
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

486
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:37,230
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

487
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:41,250
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

488
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:46,630
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

489
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:53,980
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

490
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:58,910
♫ All are just illusions ♫

491
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:05,610
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

492
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:10,860
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

493
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:15,160
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

494
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:21,460
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

495
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:26,860
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

496
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:32,120
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

497
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:34,930
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

498
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:44,260
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from my previous life ♫

499
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:56,050
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

500
00:43:56,050 --> 00:44:01,490
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

501
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:05,910
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

502
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:12,150
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

503
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:17,490
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

504
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:23,010
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

505
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:25,670
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

506
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:34,550
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

507
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:47,510
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
