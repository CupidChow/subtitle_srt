”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

2
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:17,580
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,060
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,600
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,110
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,290
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:35,150
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:38,720
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,460
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,840
♫ If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,400
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,010
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,380
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,950
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:03,530
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:07,070
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,420
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,990
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,980
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,840
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,250
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,830
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:28,060
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:31,850
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:34,490
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:38,890
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,060
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,910
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

29
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,470
[Eternal Love]

30
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,850
[Episode 13]

31
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:28,380
At that time, I picked you up over here.

32
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,390
When I picked you up, you were dying.

33
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,490
When I took you back, you weren't awake.

34
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,610
I thought I picked up a dead snake.

35
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,290
I was here to recover.

36
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,320
I could have fully recovered in three days.

37
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,080
I never expected to be taken in by you, who applied the flesh-decaying herb on my wound.

38
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,820
The wound hasn't gotten better.

39
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:47,840
But you won't understand anything I've said.

40
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,730
Over here, you can leave if you want.

41
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:58,240
But if you really go, I won't have anyone to talk to.

42
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,450
Little Kingfisher.

43
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,280
Little Kingfisher, are you injured?

44
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,080
You look like the one that ran away from me.

45
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,060
If you don't mind, let's go back home together.

46
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:26,040
This bird is very pitiful. I'm bringing her home now.

47
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:55,440
To you, am I any different from this Kingfisher?

48
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,380
You're an unmarried woman.

49
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:33,020
Yet you have shared a bed with the crown prince of the Heavenly Tribe for three months.

50
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:38,000
If I don't marry you, I fear no one else would dare touch you again.

51
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,780
Golden Lion!

52
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,810
Princess, Your Highness.

53
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:16,800
You're alive? Where were you in the last 70,000 years?

54
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,260
Your Highness, since Second Prince took the throne, I left.

55
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,240
Why did you leave?

56
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,370
Have you seen my eldest brother?

57
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:30,240
Have you always been looking for His First Highness?

58
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,760
Yes.

59
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,350
All these years, I have been searching for my eldest brother's whereabouts.

60
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:39,070
Do you know where he is?

61
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,920
His Second Highness never told Your Highness anything?!

62
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,520
Told me what?

63
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:49,870
- In this world, only he knows where the His First Highness is.
- What does that mean?

64
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:53,730
70,000 years ago, Winged Monarch personally led the rebelling army

65
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:57,190
and locked Eldest Prince in the Land of Extreme Coldness Prison.

66
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,940
It cannot be.

67
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,850
How could it not be?

68
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,760
My second older brother would never do anything like that.

69
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:09,010
But what if Eldest Prince personally killed Winged Monarch's birth mother?

70
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,290
What did you say?

71
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:14,930
Big Brother killed the second older brother's birth mother?

72
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,800
Your Highness, don't make a sound.

73
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,290
I can smell Heavenly Tribesmen.

74
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,360
Heavenly Tribesmen?

75
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,590
Come take a look.

76
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,950
Good. She actually brought a black snake into this city.

77
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:51,360
That is the greatest taboo in the Zhongrong Empire!

78
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:04,460
You again.

79
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:07,990
Miss, you still remember me.

80
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,230
Last time, it was you who snatched my fan.

81
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:13,840
- Of course, I remember.
- Last time, you embarrassed me.

82
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,760
Even in my dreams, hatred could wake me up.

83
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:22,370
Fortunately... Fortunately, I met you again today.

84
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,980
What do you want to do?

85
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,380
What do you think?

86
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,280
What are you doing?

87
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:33,310
- I want to let everyone see just what is inside here!
- Let go!

88
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,010
- Everyone look! This witch came back again.
- Witch?

89
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:40,470
- What? Witch?
- Witch?

90
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:46,160
That day, she and another witch colluded and snatched away a treasure from my ancestors.

91
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:54,230
For the sake of all the citizens, I never left just to reveal this witch's true identity one day and let everyone know the truth.

92
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,970
This young lady is really out of luck.

93
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,510
You've got your eyes on her. Right?

94
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:03,540
A few days ago you snatched her fan and failed, and even got ridiculed by a passing beauty.

95
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:07,530
So what! You lost and are now bent on revenge because of that?

96
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:08,960
- That's right.
- That's right.

97
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,510
Don't blame me for not telling you what's in the basket.

98
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:16,440
The evilest thing is inside here.

99
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,450
- A black snake!
- What? A black snake?

100
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,350
- A black snake?
- A black snake?

101
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:23,550
- Such a monster!
- A monster!

102
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:26,260
How about it? You're scared, right?

103
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,400
You, a Taoist priest, have lied to us before.

104
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,420
You say it's a black snake.

105
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,250
Do you think we'll believe you?

106
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,460
- Yes! That's right!
- If you don't believe me,

107
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,090
I can uncover this old cloth and let you all see it.

108
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:39,960
Never mind! Never mind!

109
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,080
It's only a small snake.

110
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,930
It won't harm anyone.

111
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:51,550
Miss, hearing your words, there is really a black snake in this basket?

112
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,260
Yes, but it is really not an evil thing.

113
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:58,140
- There really is an evil thing!
- Burn it!

114
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,000
- Burn it! Burn it!
- No!

115
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,050
Burn it! Burn it!

116
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,930
Burn it! Burn it!

117
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:08,200
- No!
- Burn it!

118
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,410
Burn it! Burn it!

119
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:17,890
The demon-trapping rope of my ancestors can finally be used today!

120
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,140
- Burn it!
- Burn the black snake! Burn it!

121
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,210
- There really is a black snake in it!
- There is really one.

122
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:30,730
- Burn it! Burn it!
- Hit it to death!

123
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,710
Hit it to death! Hit it to death!

124
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,100
Hit it to death!

125
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,630
- Hit it to death!
- Hit the witch to death!

126
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:38,200
Hit it to death!

127
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,680
They are going too far!

128
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,740
Hit it. Hit it!

129
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,950
Your Highness, calm down.

130
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:45,150
- Take a look at what is in the basket.
- Hit it to death!

131
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:49,380
- Hit it!
- An evil thing.

132
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,080
Red Dragon.

133
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,890
It's a divine dragon!

134
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:04,320
It's a divine dragon! It really is!

135
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,180
It's a divine dragon!

136
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,740
No, it can't be. It can't be!

137
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:51,580
Aren't you... you a black snake?

138
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:55,120
In this world, only you treat me as a snake.

139
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,050
But you've become so big now.

140
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:59,850
How am I suppose to take care of you in the future?

141
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:03,770
Now that I have revealed my true form, the Heavenly Palace will know about this.

142
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:05,820
Please wait for me patiently for a few days.

143
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:33,660
Miss! Miss, this black dragon rescued me and my grandson before.

144
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,660
I don't have anything to repay you with.

145
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:39,290
Miss, why don't you come over and eat with us?

146
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:41,060
No need, Grandma.

147
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,740
He's your life savior, not me.

148
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,920
- Miss, we wrongly accused you just now.
- Yes, that's right.

149
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,840
Miss, you must stay here.

150
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,580
Please stay here so we can make it up. Okay?

151
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:56,070
No need. It's going to be dark soon if I don't go back.

152
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:58,070
Miss, you cannot just leave.

153
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,750
- Yes, Miss.
- Yes, Miss.

154
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,920
- If you leave it this way, we'll feel very guilty.
- Thank you.
- Come to my house.

155
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,090
- Miss! Miss, please stay!
 - Don't leave.

156
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:09,070
- Stay here! Miss! Miss!
- Miss! Miss!

157
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:12,790
Miss! Don't leave.

158
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:17,910
- We wrongly accused this young lady earlier.
- It's our fault. It's our fault.

159
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:23,270
Earlier, you said that my eldest brother killed my second brother's older birth mother?

160
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:26,610
Yes. I heard it personally from Li Jing.

161
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,030
It cannot be wrong.

162
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:32,940
When Eldest Prince first disappeared, have you never suspected anything?

163
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,130
No.

164
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,270
I never suspected my second older brother.

165
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:41,110
If you don't believe me, you can follow me to the Land of Extreme Coldness Prison in the Winged Realm.

166
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:43,640
You'll know immediately know the truth once you see it.

167
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,940
Without my second older brother's commander seal, no one can get close to there.

168
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,870
Right. So, we need Your Highness to steal the commander seal.

169
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,550
We can then rescue His First Highness.

170
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,710
- Steal?
- Your Highness,

171
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:58,930
His First Highness's life is in your hands.

172
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:01,150
Why hesitate?

173
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,780
I took care of you for so long,

174
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:32,740
but I didn't know you were a small black dragon.

175
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:39,060
Since you are a dragon,

176
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:43,980
you should go to the place you belong to.

177
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,950
Crown Prince, why did you come to me?

178
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:59,900
A few days ago, I asked you about the Kunlun Fan of Yuqing. Do you still remember?

179
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:04,360
I remember. Didn't you say that the fan was in the hands of a mortal?

180
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:09,330
That's right. But when I went to the mortal realm to investigate, I discovered that the fan vanished.

181
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:11,790
Will you be able to find its whereabouts?

182
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:17,290
All the weapons of our Heavenly Tribe are the same as us immortals.

183
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,110
They don't appear in the records.

184
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:29,070
If you are interested in this mortal, I can help you look at her book of fate.

185
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,750
No need.

186
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,360
I do not need to know about her life.

187
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:40,520
Sorry for being nosy.

188
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:43,350
About this,

189
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:49,570
I do want you to go to the mortal realm to help me with something.

190
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,690
Your Highness, please say.

191
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,670
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

192
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,420
- You may leave.
- Yes.

193
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,760
How dare you!

194
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:33,890
In this palace, only you like to be mean to me.

195
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,330
Heavenly Monarch already decided on the date to confer you as a side consort.

196
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,240
You shouldn't come here anymore.

197
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:45,870
But I want to serve you one last time, can I not?

198
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:51,810
Since you were 10,000 years old, I accompanied you with reading every day.

199
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:54,960
Whether in the morning or evening, I was beside you.

200
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:59,280
Can't you grant me my wish this time?

201
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:03,000
Leave.

202
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,870
Su Jin, you better think about it carefully.

203
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:17,780
If you don't leave, I will call the servants to come and see how you are behaving in my palace.

204
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:20,330
Even if you have thousands of reasons,

205
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,890
you won't be able to become the heavenly consort.

206
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,040
You're threatening me.

207
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:48,000
I am currently in my prime.

208
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:55,410
If it were not for you, why would I marry myself to the Heavenly Monarch?

209
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:08,540
So are you saying you want to spend time with that woman?

210
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,190
That's right.

211
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,540
You brat, you even have such a day like today.

212
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,310
Do you now know what a woman is?

213
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,900
It's not what you think it is, Third Uncle.

214
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,750
To me, she is like something that I have lost.

215
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,690
After going through many trials, I've finally found it.

216
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:25,780
Third Uncle, do you understand what I said?

217
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,290
Of course, I understand.

218
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:29,830
You've said so much. I only need three words.

219
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,340
What is it?

220
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,580
You're in love.

221
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:37,070
Instead of saying I'm in love, treat it as a repayment of gratitude.

222
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:41,330
Repay her gratitude? Just for that little injury you received from the golden lion?

223
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:44,000
Is that worth you saying the words "repay her gratitude?"

224
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,720
Come on. You don't need to be embarrassed.

225
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,150
Based on what you said, you guys are fated.

226
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:52,850
Also, you shared the same bed as her for several months in the mortal realm.

227
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:54,910
Although that is just a few hours in heavenly time,

228
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,700
it's also considered as your first time.

229
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,380
Think back. You have lived for thousands of years.

230
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:02,980
How many female immortals in all those banquets wanted to talk to you more.

231
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,400
Have you ever given them a chance?

232
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,480
So, unless you have fallen in love, how can you share her bed?

233
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,840
Okay, don't argue.

234
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,480
It's okay if you're in love. We can still talk about it.

235
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,050
Talk about what?

236
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:25,510
Didn't you come to me to ask me how you can make her like you back?

237
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,000
Yes.

238
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:32,320
But about the mortal women, I have never had any exposure to them.

239
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,260
There's a good saying.

240
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,830
Since ancient times, beautiful women have loved good looking men.

241
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:41,300
Would any young woman not like a Prince Charming?

242
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:47,370
Walk in front of her then stand and smile.

243
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:50,740
I guarantee she'll get captured.

244
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:56,290
Don't want to appear to the visuals?

245
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:58,730
Okay, let's change to something else.

246
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:01,960
Since ancient times, beautiful women have loved heroes.

247
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,290
Go to the mountain and release a monster to scare her.

248
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:07,030
Once she's scared out of her wits,

249
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:11,560
bring out your Qingming Sword, charge out in a heroic and valiant manner, and kill that monster.

250
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,390
You will become her savior then.

251
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:16,430
She would have nothing to repay you but give herself to you.

252
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:22,370
Third Uncle, is this the method you used to trick Cheng Yu into giving herself to you?

253
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:26,280
Cheng Yu and I ended it 30,000 years ago.

254
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,460
That's in the past.

255
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,060
Why are we talking about her? Continue with yours.

256
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,890
Do you like this method?

257
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,990
Third Uncle, this method won't work.

258
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:38,630
A few days ago, I revealed my true form in front of her,

259
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:42,050
- but she was not even afraid. She—
- What?

260
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:48,040
She's different from other girls.

261
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:54,270
You looked down on being a Prince Charming.

262
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:57,000
The hero tactic doesn't work, either.

263
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,990
So why don't we reverse it?

264
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,500
How about using the trick of self-injury to win her over?

265
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:09,070
- Third Uncle.
- You like this one?

266
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:11,850
Perhaps, this could be used.

267
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,640
Thank you, Third Uncle.

268
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:16,550
I'll remind you of something.

269
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:21,040
You better put up a divine barrier with several layers on that Junji Mountain to prevent Heaven from knowing about it.

270
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,910
Otherwise, one day people will eventually realize that you, the crown prince of Heavenly Tribe, lives in the Eastern Wilderness.

271
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:29,410
Third Uncle, don't worry. Before I came here, I already prepared the divine barrier.

272
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:31,570
I'm not even finished yet!

273
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:36,250
He's so good looking. Why would he need to use the trick of self-injury to win her over?

274
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,690
No! No! It cannot be!

275
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,650
It cannot be!

276
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:46,110
Why couldn't you have offended anyone else?

277
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:49,340
Instead, you chose the Crown Prince.

278
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:53,880
His Highness has said that people like you should be punished.

279
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,990
Lowlife! He's trying to hurt me...

280
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:59,570
- He used deception.
- Enough, enough.

281
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:05,000
I have read your book of fate.

282
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,460
You did many bad deeds.

283
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:11,240
- Your good health...
- Deception. Deception.

284
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,080
Your good health will end this year.

285
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:20,330
I came here from afar, what should I write about you?

286
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:33,000
Originally, I thought that since winter was almost here,

287
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,560
I'd dig a snake hole to let you hibernate.

288
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:42,740
It turns out that the black dragon has flown away.

289
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,130
I don't need to worry anymore.

290
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,620
Let's go.

291
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,230
You... What's wrong with you?

292
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,000
Are you okay?

293
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:52,250
There's so much blood.

294
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:01,320
Oh, no. Oh, no.

295
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,730
These herbs are for kingfishers and small black snakes to use.

296
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:07,250
I don't know if it's usable on humans.

297
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:13,150
Don't move. Don't move.

298
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,150
You just lost a lot of blood.

299
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,960
Are you okay?

300
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,220
Miss, don't worry. It's just a minor injury.

301
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,370
It's just a minor injury? You... have been bleeding non-stop.

302
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:24,990
You... wait here.

303
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:28,290
The medicine will be ready soon. Wait for me.

304
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,890
I didn't clean the wound for you yet.

305
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:40,380
Wait for me.

306
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:14,700
Can you... you take off your own clothes?

307
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:20,050
No need to trouble you.

308
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,050
Okay. Okay.

309
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:26,180
I... I'll help you.

310
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,940
I'll clean it up for you.

311
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,620
It will hurt a bit. Please bear with it.

312
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,180
Does it hurt?

313
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:03,000
I'll help you change the bucket of water.

314
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:17,830
Could it be that I pushed it too far?

315
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:20,160
Why is she crying so much?

316
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:24,260
I'll call a physician for you. Okay?

317
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:35,650
I should help you find a physician.

318
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:37,900
This medicine can only be used on small creatures.

319
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,000
I see that your wound is pretty deep.

320
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,670
I'm afraid—

321
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:45,600
Your wound healed?!

322
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:51,480
The wound got healed completely.

323
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,820
How can it be?

324
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,770
But... just now—

325
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:14,280
I heard Junji Mountain of the Eastern Wilderness had a miracle herb that could heal injuries.

326
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:18,100
Perhaps the herb that you used on me is that miracle herb.

327
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:23,580
I... picked up those medicinal herbs randomly.

328
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:27,300
I don't know if it is a miracle herb or not.

329
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,630
Then, do you have internal injuries?

330
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:38,610
Miss, you are right. The internal injury is very serious.

331
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:40,670
Why were you so badly injured?

332
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:43,470
Did your enemy seek revenge?

333
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:47,510
I met a monster and fought with it.

334
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:49,240
Monster?

335
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,730
Are there monsters here?

336
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:54,860
Miss, you are not aware, but there are many monsters in the mountain.

337
00:27:56,590 --> 00:28:01,530
I have lived here for many months and I have never seen a monster.

338
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:03,470
That mon—

339
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,700
If you... you are having a hard time, stop talking.

340
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,810
Just lie down.

341
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:12,590
Okay then. Thank you, Miss.

342
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,290
I will cook some food for you.

343
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:16,090
Okay.

344
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:39,310
I used a basket of loquat fruits to trade for a small amount of rice at the base of the mountain.

345
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:41,490
There aren't many vegetables, either.

346
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:44,210
- Sorry for the trouble, Miss.
- Here.

347
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:45,930
Okay.

348
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,300
Looking at your condition, I think I should feed you.

349
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,690
I dare not trouble you.

350
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,660
It's okay.

351
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,690
Anyway, I usually take care of injured birds and animals.

352
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:01,540
It's not a problem.

353
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,860
Miss, you are very kind.

354
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:11,720
I'm the only one living here in the mountain. The town is also far away.

355
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:16,230
Instead of saying that I took them in, it's more like they keep me company.

356
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:21,370
Or else, it's too lonely for me to be here alone.

357
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:25,680
Looking at how serious your injury is, why don't you stay here and recuperate?

358
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:29,420
In any case, the rice that I traded for should last you for a few days.

359
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,270
Thank you, Miss.

360
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:36,850
What about you?

361
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:43,640
The porridge that I... I cooked today doesn't seem sufficient.

362
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:49,600
If you are still not full, I will go and look for some fruits for you.

363
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,290
Miss.

364
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,970
You are my savior.

365
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:57,440
Can you tell me your name?

366
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:04,790
I... I don't have a name.

367
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:06,960
You don't have a name?

368
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:10,990
I don't have a name or family.

369
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:15,770
I live alone in the mountain and don't have any friends, either.

370
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:19,740
Since this is the case,

371
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:23,520
let me give you one. Okay?

372
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,190
You will give me one?

373
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:31,250
Miss, you are simply dressed and elegant.

374
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:35,090
The word "Su Su" (plain) suits you very well.

375
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:40,440
Su Su? Su Su.

376
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,100
Okay, I'm called Su Su then.

377
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:46,410
Thank you for giving me a name. I'm going to find fruits for you.

378
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:48,470
Miss...

379
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:51,400
Don't you want to know my name?

380
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,490
I forgot to ask.

381
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:58,680
What's your name?

382
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,530
Ye Hua.

383
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:06,330
Which characters are Ye Hua?

384
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:11,480
Can you write it down for me?

385
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,650
I got it.

386
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,830
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

387
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:06,560
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost

388
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:11,880
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

389
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:20,950
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

390
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:25,060
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

391
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:30,540
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

392
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:37,880
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

393
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:44,260
♫ All are just illusions ♫

394
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:49,830
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

395
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:55,130
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

396
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:59,440
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

397
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:05,830
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

398
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:11,150
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

399
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:16,420
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

400
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:19,160
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

401
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:27,160
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from my previous life ♫

402
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:37,880
♫ Still holds some hatred from my previous life ♫

403
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,320
What's wrong?

404
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,920
Did I bump into your injury?

405
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,810
- No problem.
- Good.

406
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:03,650
Let's quickly leave then.

407
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:08,790
What happened?

408
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:12,550
I wanted to cook something for you.

409
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:16,850
Why is there such thick smoke when you are cooking?

410
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:19,290
It has always been like this.

411
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,010
How did you survive before I came?

412
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:30,230
Because I'm not picky with food, when I'm hungry, I would just look for fruits.

413
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:35,690
If I could hunt some small animals, I would just roast them.

414
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:37,790
Fortunately, you know to roast them.

415
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:39,790
People can't eat raw meat.

416
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:41,280
I can't eat raw meat.

417
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,520
If I do, my stomach will hurt.

418
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,500
But in the past, I kept a small black snake.

419
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,680
It loved raw meat and ate a lot daily.

420
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,080
It was hard to rear it.

421
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,180
Was it that hard to rear?

422
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:56,330
You haven't reared a snake before, right?

423
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:59,550
Naturally, you don't know how tough it is.

424
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:02,800
That little black snake was extremely finicky.

425
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,860
It wanted to sleep with me every day.

426
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:09,600
Moreover, because I feared it would get cold, I even got a bed quilt for it.

427
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:15,460
Su Su, do you know that snakes don't need to sleep on a bed?

428
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,380
They don't need to be covered by a bed quilt, either.

429
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:20,230
- Really?
- Yes.

430
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:26,990
Perhaps, that snake was different from the others.

431
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:32,570
So after that, it really transformed into a big black dragon.

432
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:34,980
It's probably as big as this thatched cottage.

433
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:38,770
It flew away later and didn't come back again.

434
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:42,800
Okay, let's stop talking about that ungrateful snake.

435
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,340
There should still be some fruits left in the house that you can eat.

436
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:48,080
I'll go gather some medicinal herbs for you.

437
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,060
Su Su.

438
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:09,580
Why are you here? You were injured badly.

439
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:12,150
You also walked this far. Are you okay?

440
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:16,970
I'm fine. I saw how you were not yet back, so I came out to look for you.

441
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:19,850
- I was lost.
- You're lost?

442
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:26,090
The last time I came into the forest, it took me a total of seven to eight days to come out.

443
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:28,300
Seven to eight days?

444
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:32,710
For you to be able to get lost like this, it is also a kind of ability.

445
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:35,570
I know you want to laugh at me. It's okay.

446
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:37,970
You can laugh. Don't hold it in.

447
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:45,140
I'm always very forgiving to unintelligent people.

448
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:53,770
You were injured and walked pretty far.

449
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:57,110
You don't have any energy to walk back, right?

450
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:06,610
Actually, I wanted to pick up some medicinal herbs for you and then go back.

451
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:09,590
But I got lost.

452
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:14,200
It looks like a person like me is more suitable for handling small animals.

453
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:19,390
No wonder after my small black dragon left, it never came back to visit me.

454
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:22,030
He must've really disliked me.

455
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,190
- You really miss him?
- Yes.

456
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:32,670
Maybe, he had to leave.

457
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,800
Dragons are of the ancient divine tribes.

458
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,750
They only appear in the mortal world to eliminate monsters and demons.

459
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:44,490
And exactly because it's from the divine tribe, it can't stay long in the mortal realm.

460
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:48,490
Or else, it will affect the fate of the mortals and lead to trouble.

461
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:51,080
Really?

462
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,720
I remembered.

463
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,360
When my little black dragon flew away,

464
00:38:55,360 --> 00:39:01,280
the citizens in the city indeed said that he had subdued the Gold...

465
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,760
Fiery Golden Lion.

466
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,480
Right, Golden Lion!

467
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,280
How did you know?

468
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,980
It looks like we need to stay here for a night.

469
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:15,400
You can make the fire and I'll tell you.

470
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,720
Okay, wait for me.

471
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:34,310
You can continue.

472
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:35,900
Are you tired?

473
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:40,900
I'm not. Although the story you told isn't as exciting as those said in teahouses,

474
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,840
at least I've never heard them before.

475
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:49,560
That Fiery Golden Lion arrived here at the Junji Mountain of the Eastern Wilderness ten years ago.

476
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:54,550
It caused the Zhongrong Empire below the mountain to suffer drought for ten years.

477
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:57,810
Its citizens were forced to leave their homes and wander miserably.

478
00:39:57,810 --> 00:40:01,110
- Is it really this strong?
- Yes.

479
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:05,330
After ten years, that Golden Lion became more arrogant.

480
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:09,310
He fell in love with the wife of the king and abducted her back into his cave.

481
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,980
And then?

482
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,780
He tainted her.

483
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:31,330
Look at you.

484
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:36,160
I didn't even feel embarrassed, but you're blushing.

485
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:46,830
Then, you can continue on and finish the story.

486
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:52,370
Then...

487
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:57,420
Then, that Golden Lion got subdued by that little black dragon you cared for.

488
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,620
What happened next?

489
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,280
Then...

490
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:09,940
although that black dragon defeated the Golden Lion,

491
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:13,350
he got injured a bit.

492
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,180
Then...

493
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,110
Then he met you.

494
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:30,510
”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

495
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:32,410
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

496
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:35,010
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

497
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:40,550
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

498
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:48,670
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

499
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,870
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

500
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:59,200
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

501
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:06,470
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

502
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:11,160
♫ All are just illusions ♫

503
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:18,190
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

504
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:23,400
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

505
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:27,650
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

506
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:34,100
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

507
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:39,270
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

508
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:44,670
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

509
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:47,360
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

510
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:56,130
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from my previous life ♫

511
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:08,690
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

512
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:14,110
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

513
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:18,530
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

514
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:24,800
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

515
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:29,930
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

516
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:35,390
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

517
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:38,170
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

518
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:47,450
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

519
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:59,540
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
