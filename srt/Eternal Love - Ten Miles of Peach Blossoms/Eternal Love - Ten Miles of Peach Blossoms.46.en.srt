”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

2
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,580
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,110
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:24,660
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,210
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,390
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:35,310
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,800
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,410
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,980
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,460
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:53,000
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,480
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,930
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:03,570
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,180
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,550
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:14,200
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,020
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,830
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:21,260
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,900
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,160
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,890
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,580
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:38,970
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:42,140
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:46,650
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

[Eternal Love]

30
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:12,920
[Episode 46]

31
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,660
I'm going to have a good rest.

32
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,470
Don't disturb me.

33
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,370
Teacher's soul has been completed.

34
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:35,890
Next, I should prepare to go to Yingzhou in the Eastern Sea to obtain the Mystical Mushroom.

35
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,130
I need to find a way to avoid Eldest Senior Brother,

36
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:42,450
lest the seniors will fight with me again if they find out.

37
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,650
I was wondering who it was, so it's you.

38
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,800
I'm very tired. Can you let me sleep for two days?

39
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,660
Someone is here to see you.

40
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,720
Who? Tell him that I can't go out and ask him to come in instead.

41
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,950
Are you sure?

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,900
Please come in.

43
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,660
Young Fifth.

44
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:19,120
Welcome, Second Older Brother.

45
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,590
Since you did this to guard High God Mo Yuan's soul,

46
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,440
you don't need to go through all these formalities.

47
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,280
Thank you, Second Older Brother, for your understanding.

48
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,560
I will get straight to the point then.

49
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,150
I heard that the Water Monarch of the Western Sea say that

50
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,170
whoever can cure the eldest prince's illness,

51
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:38,150
the daughter of that family can marry into Crystal Palace.

52
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,050
He did say that.

53
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,590
High God Bai Yi, are you...

54
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,890
What do you think of my daughter?

55
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,280
That little girl?

56
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,000
She's young,

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,720
but her mother also married young.

58
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,900
Even if I'm willing,

59
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,420
Bai Qian may not be willing.

60
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,660
What?

61
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,460
I feel that...

62
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:10,200
There's a wide gap in age.

63
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,860
To add further, I don't know anything about love.

64
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,680
Why don't we do this? I will take you to meet my older brother.

65
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,350
What do you think?

66
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,810
What's wrong? Are you rejecting my daughter?

67
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,790
I wouldn't dare. I wouldn't dare.

68
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:31,570
Second Older Brother, I understand that you hope Young Jiu will forget...

69
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,190
certain things,

70
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,490
but forcing a marriage is not a good idea.

71
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:45,100
Then, as Fengjiu's aunt, do you have a better way to make her forget that emperor of Nine Heavens?

72
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,820
I...

73
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,590
Do you have a way or not?

74
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,950
I have one.

75
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,210
Huh?

76
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,220
Who is Bai Fengjiu of Green Hill?

77
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:04,590
Once she's of the right age, if you publicize it, there will surely be a lot of men coming to seek her hand in marriage.

78
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:08,760
I don't understand love, and my brother is sick and lying in bed.

79
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,420
Neither of us is a good candidate.

80
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:14,400
It's better to let those young people of the same age come and propose marriage.

81
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,330
What do you think, High God Bai Yi?

82
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:21,060
It makes sense.

83
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,540
This can't be delayed.

84
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,960
Let Fengjiu start from the Western Sea then.

85
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,590
Start what?

86
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,990
Start to accept the visiting cards.

87
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:33,390
I don't believe there aren't any talented men of proper age in Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses.

88
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,610
That's right. That's right.

89
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,940
The both of you can discuss this first.

90
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,060
I... I'm very sleepy.

91
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,690
I'm going to sleep first.

92
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,860
I won't be keeping you company.

93
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:51,130
High God, let's go out and talk further.

94
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,000
- After you.
- Fine.

95
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:02,960
Young Jiu, no one in our family dares to provoke your father.

96
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,030
Just deal with it and see who can capture your heart.

97
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:10,670
Your Majesty, look at how nice the weather is today.

98
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,550
Let me accompany you to the garden for a stroll. Okay?

99
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:53,900
Emperor, did you hear the news from Green Hill?

100
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,000
They said that Her Young Highness Bai Fengjiu has come of age.

101
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,860
They are recruiting a potential partner for her.

102
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:04,600
High God Bai Yi is in a hurry to marry Her Young Highness off.

103
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,000
They are not waiting for her to return to Green Hill.

104
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,930
They have started to accept visiting cards in the Western Sea.

105
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,500
What are you trying to say?

106
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,820
I'm casually mentioning this.

107
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:21,120
After all, Her Young Highness and you are considered old friends.

108
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,070
Deliver this to the Western Sea.

109
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:49,330
Western Sea? Emperor, since when were you friends with the Western Sea Water Monarch?

110
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:53,120
Didn't you say that Bai Fengjiu is in the Western Sea?

111
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,960
Emperor, do you mean to give this to Her Young Highness?

112
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,670
That's right.

113
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:03,610
May I ask what's in here?

114
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:08,430
That way when I hand this to her, I can explain it to her.

115
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,180
You can open it.

116
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:18,300
- Just this?
- That's right.

117
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,500
Emperor, do you have a message to be relayed?

118
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:29,050
Tell her that she saved me once in the Mortal Realm.

119
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:31,660
We are even now.

120
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,730
It's useless for me to keep this.

121
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:35,210
Return this to her.

122
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:38,450
Regard it as a memento of our relationship.

123
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,870
That's all?

124
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:43,610
What else do you want?

125
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:47,760
I wouldn't dare to guess what's on your mind.

126
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,730
I'm going now.

127
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:10,380
Aunt, I'm hiding in the Western Sea,

128
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,940
but my father still found me.

129
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,880
Just accept your fate.

130
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,290
Staying in this nice garden and receiving gifts from talented young men in Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses

131
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:23,620
Staying in this nice garden and receiving gifts from talented young men in Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses

132
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:27,060
is better than marrying my eldest senior brother, right?

133
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,950
Rightly so.

134
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,510
- Great Lady.
- Young Highness.

135
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,560
This was made from the scales of Qiongqi, one of the four great mythical beasts of Yingzhou in the Eastern Sea.

136
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,320
It's just a little gift that's not enough to show my respect.

137
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,160
I hope Your Young Highness won't find it too ordinary.

138
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,610
What rare item is there from Yingzhou in the Eastern Sea?

139
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:53,510
My grandfather went there for a stroll once, too.

140
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,950
He also brought back the Mystical Mushroom.

141
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,890
That's right. Fox Emperor Bai Zhi is indeed the emperor of the Five Wildernesses.

142
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:02,110
He even managed to get the Mystical Mushroom from the four ferocious beasts on his own.

143
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:05,050
Our generation really worships him. No one in Heaven or Earth can surpass him.

144
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,740
What about Emperor Dong Hua?

145
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,090
The Emperor... That old man...

146
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:10,770
Is he old?

147
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,490
He's not old. Although he's been around since the former Heavenly Monarch's reign,

148
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,930
he has a youthful appearance.

149
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:18,230
He's definitely not old.

150
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:22,910
This was made from the wings of the Great Roc that Buddha sits on.

151
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,330
This is the luminous pearl from the Long Sea.

152
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:33,160
Everyone, please go to the front hall and leave behind your names so I can know who delivered the gifts.

153
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,400
I will return them in the future.

154
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,110
Can Your Young Highness repay so many gifts?

155
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:49,090
Si Ming!

156
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:51,570
Si Ming, you are here at the right time. Keep her company.

157
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,510
I'm going to sleep.

158
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,510
Si Ming, I met a lot of people today.

159
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:01,070
I'm the happiest to see you.

160
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:05,560
Is that so? Does my face have that effect?

161
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,660
Speak. Why are you here to see me?

162
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,200
Congratulations, Young Highness.

163
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:15,500
Although you have used more than three hundred years, but eventually, you paid back your debt of gratitude.

164
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,560
That's right.

165
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,970
After repaying my debt of gratitude, Nine Heavens and I are not connected anymore.

166
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,120
Aren't you usually busy taking care of the Mortal Realm?

167
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,600
Why do you have the time to specially visit me today?

168
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:39,660
The Emperor instructed me to return these two items to you.

169
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:44,280
He said that you saved his life once in the Mortal Realm, so you are even now.

170
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,140
It's useless leaving these two items with him.

171
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:52,060
It's better to gift them to you as a memento of you two's relationship.

172
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:21,410
Your Majesty, you must remember that I took that arrow for Your Majesty willingly

173
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:24,300
and do not ask for any rewards.

174
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:30,260
I only ask that you remember me and always keep me in your heart.

175
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:36,410
I will never betray you.

176
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:55,060
I got it.

177
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,720
He shouldn't have sent you here just to deliver such a worthless item over.

178
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:04,450
Emperor really...

179
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,690
has no sense of empathy.

180
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:20,990
That night, when we were escaping, there was lightning and thunder.

181
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,710
Did Si Ming do that to deliberately make things hard on us?

182
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:07,390
You are the Monarchess of Green Hill, and not just some ordinary lady.

183
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:12,460
Although there are certain things that I didn't say, you should already know.

184
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,490
I understand.

185
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:24,450
The love fate of the past life should end with the past life.

186
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:29,310
The love fate of the past life should end with the past life.

187
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,080
It's a good phrase.

188
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,270
Emperor!

189
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,340
If you can really end a past love fate in the past life,

190
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:51,300
why did you come to this run-down shack?

191
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,870
Is there something you can't forget?

192
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,200
Emperor, do you still remember

193
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:11,220
what I said when I protected you from that arrow?

194
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:19,510
You must remember that I took that arrow for Your Majesty willingly

195
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:22,470
and do not ask for any rewards.

196
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:28,660
I only ask that you remember me and always keep me in your heart.

197
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,770
I remember.

198
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,660
Then, Emperor...

199
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:42,460
I came to the Mortal Realm for tribulations to experience the hardships of the mortals.

200
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:47,780
Even if it was a love tribulation with you, it was my tribulation to go through.

201
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:53,400
You need to understand that we're not mortals.

202
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:57,310
If there's a start of fate, then there will be a day that it will end.

203
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,910
There's bound to be an end.

204
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,830
If you waver when you should have resolutely ended it,

205
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:06,260
you will only harm yourself and others.

206
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,450
Father.

207
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,380
I'm back.

208
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,410
All right.

209
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:45,650
I'll prepare food for you now.

210
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,340
Go then.

211
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,440
I'm taking my leave.

212
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,760
You woke up at the right time.

213
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,360
I just made an arm for you.

214
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,260
See if it fits you.

215
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,220
I can't feel anything.

216
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,580
It's already hard to make it look like one.

217
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,640
Just nourish it for now.

218
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,030
Perhaps, a few thousand years later, you will be able to move it.

219
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,130
Thank you, High God.

220
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,720
You indeed should thank me.

221
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,790
I spent a lot of energy just to cure your injuries.

222
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:23,980
I was so afraid that the soul of the crown prince of the Heavenly Tribe would dissipate

223
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:26,240
and die here in my Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms.

224
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,860
If that happens, I really would be wronged.

225
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,970
You just woke up and you want to act tough already?

226
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,480
What time is it?

227
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,070
Is Qian Qian still in the Western Sea?

228
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,090
I'm not sure.

229
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:49,700
Die Feng told me that you instructed Young Fifth

230
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:53,570
to attend by the bedside of the Western Sea Prince for three days and nights,

231
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:55,710
not even an hour less.

232
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:59,900
This early morning is exactly the end of the third day.

233
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,500
Did you see my medicinal pill?

234
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,180
Oh.

235
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,170
It's here.

236
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,590
That's good.

237
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,940
Please deliver this to Qian Qian,

238
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,550
but don't tell her that I gave it to you.

239
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,400
I can send this to her,

240
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,290
but you must tell me where you got this medicinal pill from.

241
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:44,380
This medicinal pill was a congratulatory gift given to me by my senior.

242
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:48,060
A few days ago, Heavenly Monarch sent me to Yingzhou in the Eastern Sea to destroy the Mythical Mushroom.

243
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:52,140
I then obtained a few in passing and refined it with the medicinal pill.

244
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:55,040
You can then give it to High God Mo Yuan.

245
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,640
You went to Yingzhou to obtain the Mystical Mushroom.

246
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,420
When the Fox Emperor previously went, he was seriously injured, too.

247
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:09,470
No wonder one of your arms was severed.

248
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:13,190
It wasn't supposed to be severed.

249
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:17,080
It's just that time, Winged Monarch Li Jing and his wife were also inside the cave.

250
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,950
In order to save them, I was careless and lost it.

251
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:23,300
Winged Monarch also wanted the Mythical Mushroom?

252
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,700
You even saved him while in the cave?

253
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:30,380
What a twist in the story.

254
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,400
Let's not talk about this.

255
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:36,410
You just told me not to tell Qian Qian.

256
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:38,990
Since this medicinal pill was created by Lord of Lingbao,

257
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:41,270
why can't you tell her?

258
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:43,890
She should be grateful to you instead.

259
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:49,900
High God, you also know that Qian Qian hates owing other people favors.

260
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:53,060
If she were to find out that I gave the medicinal pill to her,

261
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:57,310
she surely would have misgivings and not save Mo Yuan wholeheartedly.

262
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:00,460
High God, you only need to say that you're the one who gathered the Mythical Mushroom

263
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:03,000
and used your cultivation to make the medicinal pill.

264
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,360
Qian Qian is bent on saving Mo Yuan. She won't suspect anything.

265
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:14,660
Okay, I promise you.

266
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:17,370
I won't stay here for long, then.

267
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:19,790
I need to return to the Heavenly Palace to report on my mission.

268
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,120
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

269
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,750
Have you thought about this?

270
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:32,510
If Mo Yuan's spirit returns to its original body and he wakes up,

271
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:36,770
the seal of the Donghuang Bell might disappear.

272
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:40,020
What will happen to the people of this world then?

273
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:46,160
If Qing Cang wants everyone in the Four Seas to be buried with him,

274
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:50,210
the guardian of the Eight Wildernesses will naturally appear to counter him.

275
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:55,170
70,000 years ago, Mo Yuan used his spirit to seal him in the Donghuang Bell.

276
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:59,140
300 years ago, Qian Qian risked her life to fight with him.

277
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,590
In the future,

278
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:07,080
there will naturally be someone who will do the same thing.

279
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,460
Mighty Monarch.

280
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:25,210
- Let's leave.
- Yes.

281
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,020
Hey.

282
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,740
Why did you pull me back?

283
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:34,030
I only wanted to tell him that Young Fifth does care about him,

284
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:37,130
so that the two of them can sincerely treat each other.

285
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,980
The start and end of a love fate have their own reason and result.

286
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,980
It's not something that we can dictate.

287
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:57,050
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

288
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,600
Jia Yu.

289
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,040
I'm here.

290
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:16,260
Go look for Cheng Yu and tell her to take Ah Li to the Buddhist assembly in Ling Mountain for a few days.

291
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,500
Tell him that the sugar cane in the mountain is very delicious.

292
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,040
Let Ah Li have some fun.

293
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,480
- Eat sugar cane?
- Go now.

294
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,220
Yes.

295
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:31,050
- Tian Shu.
- I am here.

296
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:33,480
Go to the main hall and report on my mission.

297
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,860
Tell them that I've destroyed all the Mythical Mushrooms,

298
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:40,630
killed the four mythical beasts, and sank Yingzhou Island.

299
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:44,800
But because of it, I've consumed all my cultivation.

300
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,070
What? Mighty Monarch, your cultivation...

301
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:56,490
Remember, never mention that I've been to Ten Miles... Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms.

302
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:59,170
Mighty Monarch! Mighty Monarch!

303
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:12,880
Father Monarch really allowed it?

304
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:17,720
That's right, Young Highness. Mighty Monarch said that the sugar cane in Ling Mountain is very delicious.

305
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,820
That you can go there to join the fun, eat some sugar cane, and stay for a few days.

306
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,680
Did Father Monarch encounter some happy event?

307
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:26,220
Why is he suddenly so lenient and allowed me to play on my own?

308
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,170
What happy event can it possibly be?

309
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:31,190
Your mother must have agreed to marry your father.

310
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:36,490
Right, right. That day, Third Great Uncle said that my mother will soon get married to my Father Monarch.

311
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:37,960
Are you happy for me?

312
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,950
Yes, I'm happy.

313
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:42,730
- Young Highness, let's quickly go.
- Okay!

314
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:52,490
Quickly say it! What really has happened?!

315
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:55,320
His Highness the Crown Prince went to Yingzhou alone this time.

316
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,370
Not only did he kill the four great mythical beasts, he even sank Yinghzou Island

317
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:58,730
and destroyed all the Mythical Mushrooms.

318
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:01,900
And because of that, he exhausted all his cultivation.

319
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,780
What?

320
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:32,460
Silly child. You were fine.

321
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:39,140
Why did you insist on destroying the Mystical Mushrooms and lure this disaster on your life?

322
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,700
Where's Young Jiu?

323
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:13,780
Immortal, you are finally awake.

324
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,860
Did anything happen?

325
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:18,100
Immortal, you've been asleep for several days.

326
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:22,510
High God Zhe Yan has been waiting for you in the main hall below for two days.

327
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,950
I actually slept that long?

328
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,080
Zhe Yan.

329
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:44,070
Looking at your situation, Mo Yuan's soul has probably been cultivated.

330
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:47,060
A few days ago, I refined this medicinal pill.

331
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:50,410
I brought this especially for you. Perhaps you can use it.

332
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,060
This...

333
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:03,430
is the medicinal pill that you used your own cultivation to refine?

334
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,720
You actually knew that I wanted to transfer my cultivation to Teacher?

335
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,650
Is your body okay?

336
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,450
When you went to Yingzhou to obtain the Mystical Mushroom,

337
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:21,320
were you injured by the four ferocious beasts?

338
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:26,470
Even when my father went there, it wasn't that easy for him.

339
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,840
You are going to transfer your cultivation to Mo Yuan?

340
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,880
I didn't think of this.

341
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,620
I merely refined the medicinal pill and brought it here specially for you.

342
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:43,590
When you used your power to seal Qing Cang,

343
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,920
you lost quite a lot of your power.

344
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,280
Now that you are going to transfer your power to Mo Yuan,

345
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:51,020
you will only have a bit left.

346
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:54,740
You do not deserve the high goddess title.

347
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:00,160
Father God brought me up,

348
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:05,150
but I couldn't repay him for his kindness,

349
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:08,460
so I will help you with whatever I can.

350
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:12,400
No matter your relationship with my teacher,

351
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,970
please accept my bow for this medicinal pill.

352
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,920
Skip the formalities. I'm leaving first.

353
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,670
Find a day when Die Yong's feeling energetic and let him have this medicinal pill.

354
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:29,440
However, I don't know if his body can handle this pill.

355
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,390
It's best that you stay next to him and take care of him.

356
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:33,190
I understand.

357
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,900
High God, why are you suddenly here? Great Lady is not back yet.

358
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:51,570
No, I just saw her at the Western Sea.

359
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:54,140
Are you here to see Fourth Uncle?

360
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,600
Didn't he go to Peach Blossoms Forest?

361
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,020
I'm here to find you.

362
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,520
Me?

363
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,250
I want you to go to the Winged Realm.

364
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:04,590
Winged Realm?

365
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:08,630
High God, are you joking with me?

366
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:13,110
Do I look that bored?

367
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:23,120
Eldest Brother, this medicinal pill was refined from tens of thousands of years of cultivation.

368
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,430
Although it has the Mystical Mushroom, we fear it may be too strong.

369
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:29,400
Shield your heart first before you take it.

370
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,490
I have been sick for six hundred years.

371
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:34,280
What medicines haven't I taken?

372
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:38,140
Don't worry. I'm not that weak.

373
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:43,150
Mother Consort, don't be nervous.

374
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:46,510
I have been more relaxed in the past few days.

375
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:50,730
After going through this last stage, perhaps I can completely recover.

376
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:19,500
- Eldest Brother!
- Yong'er! Yong'er! This!

377
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,490
Immortal, didn't you say that the last stage is the most critical?

378
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:24,020
Look. What's going on?

379
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,970
Please don't worry.

380
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:29,540
High God Zhe Yan told me about this situation.

381
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:32,710
It's because Eldest Prince was sick for hundreds of years,

382
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:36,790
so his body is weak and can't handle such a potent medicinal pill.

383
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:39,800
Hence, it's normal for him to faint.

384
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:46,690
Mother Consort, don't worry. Everyone in Four Seas knows about High God Zhe Yan's medical skills.

385
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:50,980
Hence, Eldest Brother will wake up after some time.

386
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:12,350
Why are you spacing out here alone?

387
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:15,780
- I'm afraid.
- Afraid? Afraid of what?

388
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:20,660
I'm afraid that everything is fruitless and Teacher won't be able to come back.

389
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:31,340
Ever since you and Teacher vanished,

390
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:35,030
I have been looking for you for the past 70,000 years.

391
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:37,090
I didn't take a break at all.

392
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:40,360
Seventeenth, let me tell you.

393
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:46,660
Being able to see you in the Western Sea for these past days is already a great gift from Heaven to me.

394
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:50,140
As for Teacher, I believe...

395
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:55,420
there'll be a day when he returns to manage Kunlun Void and be respected by the Immortals again.

396
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:20,340
Zi Lan, you've already followed her all the way here.

397
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:23,460
She's safe and sound.

398
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,630
Stop following her.

399
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:30,450
If I step forward, it's the Winged Realm.

400
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:35,740
This is still the territory of the Heavenly Tribe.

401
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,990
I must not take another step forward.

402
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:41,690
I must... not take another step forward.

403
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:34,190
Second Senior Brother.

404
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,400
Zi Lan?

405
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,860
Rotten rascal, you are finally back.

406
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:45,120
I'm a few days late.

407
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:50,680
By the way, you tricked me into feeding your cranes and went to the Mortal Realm to find Seventeenth.

408
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:54,640
Where's Seventeenth?

409
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,280
I couldn't find him.

410
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,460
If I had found him, it wouldn't be like this.

411
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:04,850
I would have beat drums and clashed cymbals to let everyone in Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses know.

412
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:08,290
By the same, Second Senior Brother.

413
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:12,010
On the way here, I heard the Bai family of Green Hill issued a notice that

414
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:17,740
their daughter has grown up and is waiting for someone to propose marriage to her.

415
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,560
Bai Fengjiu of Green Hill?

416
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,510
Her aunt is the future monarchess of Heaven.

417
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:23,410
Who would dare to marry her?

418
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:29,170
Even if you dare to marry, she may not be willing.

419
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:31,110
You can marry her then.

420
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:34,640
I wouldn't dare. Second Senior Brother, continue with sweeping the floor.

421
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,370
I'm going to tidy up.

422
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,480
Second Older Brother.

423
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:40,380
I'm a princess, so my cultivation is useless.

424
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,380
You are the monarch of the Winged Realm.

425
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:44,810
You need to protect our people.

426
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:49,810
This child is, after all, your flesh and blood.

427
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:54,100
Since His Highness the Crown Prince gave you the Mystical Mushroom,

428
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:57,050
I will give it a try and transfer all my lifetime's cultivation to him

429
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:59,480
and see if we can wake him up.

430
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,870
Yan Zhi,

431
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,990
transferring cultivation is something the Heavenly Tribe does.

432
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,470
If you violate Heaven's will,

433
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,330
don't you know the consequences?

434
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:20,370
He's your only child.

435
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:23,030
He's also my nephew.

436
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:25,720
How could I not even give it a try?

437
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,920
Second Older Brother, please trust me.

438
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,760
I will definitely wake him up.

439
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:55,300
Mighty Monarch, someone from Green Hill is here to see you.

440
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,760
Green Hill?

441
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:04,430
- Is it a woman?
- Mighty Monarch, it's a man.

442
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:06,340
Man?

443
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,310
- Let him in.
- Yes.

444
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,940
I'm Mi Gu, an immortal under Monarchess Bai Qian of Green Hill.

445
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:24,130
Greetings, Winged Monarch.

446
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:26,990
What does the Great Lady want?

447
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:29,930
It's not from Great Lady. It's High God Zhe Yan.

448
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:32,020
High God Zhe Yan?

449
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,700
I have admired him for a long time,

450
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,200
but have never met him.

451
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:42,180
I wonder what message High God Zhe Yan has for me.

452
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:47,290
High God said that since Monarch Ye Hua saved you at Yingzhou in the Eastern Sea,

453
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:50,270
you should repay him.

454
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:55,540
- Repay him?
- Yes, repay him.

455
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,880
Zhe Yan was right.

456
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:09,300
This Eldest Prince indeed can't endure the pure cultivation within the pill.

457
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:12,040
This won't do. I should go to Peach Blossoms forest

458
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:16,500
and ask that old phoenix if there's another way to wake up Die Yong.

459
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,140
Immortal, someone from Green Hill is out there.

460
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,480
He would like to see you.

461
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,490
Green Hill?

462
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:35,250
Great Lady!

463
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:37,160
Mi Gu, what are you doing here?

464
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,750
I'm here to deliver this to you.

465
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,180
Jaded Soul?

466
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,380
Why is this with you?

467
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,900
A few days ago, High God Zhe Yan came to find me.

468
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:55,020
He wanted me to go to Grand Purple Palace to obtain the Jaded Soul from the Winged Monarch.

469
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,750
Zhe Yan?

470
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:01,390
Why did Zhe Yan tell you to go to the Winged Realm to ask for this?

471
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:03,560
How did he know that Li Jing would give this to you?

472
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,190
And he asked you to deliver this to the Western Sea?

473
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:09,420
High God only said that you shouldn't worry.

474
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:12,070
He knows that you hate to owe any favors to others.

475
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:15,710
This Jaded Soul wasn't given as a favor to you.

476
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:20,170
A few days ago, Winged Monarch was saved by His Highness the Crown Prince.

477
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:22,960
Since you are the crown prince's future wife,

478
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,930
it's natural that this debt of gratitude should be returned to Green Hill.

479
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:29,820
When did Ye Hua save Li Jing?

480
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,560
Huh? I don't know, either.

481
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,160
I only followed High God's instructions to relay what he said.

482
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,310
Forget it. Even if I ask you, you wouldn't know anything.

483
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:43,840
Once the eldest prince wakes up, I'm going to question Zhe Yan.

484
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:46,440
By the way, Great Lady!

485
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,200
There's something else.

486
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,880
High God Zhe Yan also said that the medicinal pill is too potent.

487
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,070
If Eldest Prince takes it, he won't be able to withstand it.

488
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:56,800
If you want Eldest Prince to take it without any adverse reactions,

489
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,890
you must place this Jaded Soul on his body.

490
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:02,930
He will wake up after three days.

491
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:10,370
It's such an important message and you left it till the end.

492
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:12,760
You stuttered through so much irrelevant stuff first.

493
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,480
You almost ruined my plan.

494
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,800
Forget it. I'll personally ask Zhe Yan about Ye Hua.

495
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,910
You can leave.

496
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:49,820
Based on what Zhe Yan said, will you really be able to return this time?

497
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:56,710
When did Ye Hua save Li Jing?

498
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:27,350
”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

499
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:29,450
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

500
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:32,000
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

501
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,320
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

502
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:46,780
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

503
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:50,670
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

504
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:55,960
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

505
00:43:55,960 --> 00:44:01,470
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

506
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:08,300
♫ All are just illusions ♫

507
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:14,970
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

508
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:20,200
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

509
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:24,680
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

510
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:30,870
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

511
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:36,260
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

512
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:41,510
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

513
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:44,340
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

514
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:53,840
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from
my previous life ♫

515
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:05,390
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

516
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:10,920
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

517
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:15,360
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

518
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:21,520
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

519
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:26,820
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

520
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:32,150
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

521
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:34,930
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

522
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:44,100
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

523
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:56,360
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
