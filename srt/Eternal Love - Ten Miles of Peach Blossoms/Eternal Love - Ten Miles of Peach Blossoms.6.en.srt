”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

2
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,580
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,120
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,550
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:27,900
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,390
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:35,170
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,730
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,320
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,900
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,360
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,810
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:56,330
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:59,990
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:03,560
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,030
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:10,570
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:14,120
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,010
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,840
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,210
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,770
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:28,000
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,870
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:34,350
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,340
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,090
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:46,670
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:12,980
[Episode 6]

31
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,160
Qing Cang is such a joke.

32
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,670
Before he has won the battle, he is already celebrating.

33
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,540
- Teacher.
- Teacher.

34
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,740
These two are my disciples, Si Yin and Ling Yu.

35
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:42,580
Give your greetings to the three sons of the Heavenly Monarch and High Goddess Yao Guang.

36
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,750
I, seventeenth disciple of Kunlun Void, Si Yin...

37
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,450
I, ninth disciple of Kunlun Void, Ling Yu...

38
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:49,110
- Greet High Goddess Yao Guang and Your Highnesses.
- Greet High Goddess Yao Guang and Your Highnesses.

39
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,240
Let's end here for tonight.

40
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,020
Teacher, why did people from the Heavenly Palace come?

41
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:10,210
Teacher, could there be bad news from the Heavenly Palace even the three princes of the Heavenly Monarch would come?

42
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,900
That's not it.

43
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,230
The three princes of the Heavenly Monarch haven't experienced a large-scale battle before.

44
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:17,700
They've come to gain experience this time.

45
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,850
I also needed some powerful people to lead the troops.

46
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:24,590
I've set up seven formations, and each formation will change into seven forms this time.

47
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,930
In total, there'll be 49 formations.

48
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:31,450
Although the princes have studied the formations, they've never practiced them.

49
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:35,060
Ling Yu, tomrrow you will lead 10,000 soldiers in the front army.

50
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,420
- I trust putting you there more.
- Yes, Teacher.

51
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,780
Teacher, what about me?

52
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,190
- You will lead the middle section with me.
- Yes.

53
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,930
Although the formations are well-designed, Qing Cang cannot be underestimated.

54
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,310
You must not underestimate our enemy.

55
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,730
Yes, Teacher. I will not fail you for sure.

56
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,210
Teacher.

57
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:13,510
Are you worried about tomorrow's great battle?

58
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:20,400
Whenever I think that this place will soon be filled with corpses,

59
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,150
I think it's a waste of this beautiful view at Ruoshui Riverside.

60
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:30,740
This battle can bring at least 70,000 years of peace to the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses.

61
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:38,510
If you think about it this way, will you feel better?

62
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,510
- Seventeenth,
- Yes?

63
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:49,780
you once asked me about the spell that can seal the Donghuang Bell.

64
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,290
Do you remember?

65
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,010
I remember.

66
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:56,500
Tonight, I will pass this spell onto you.

67
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,590
Really? Thank you very much, Teacher.

68
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:02,350
I have seventeen disciples,

69
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:05,540
but you're the only one who has enough talent to use this spell.

70
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,450
If that wasn't the case,

71
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:12,430
I really wouldn't want to teach such a dangerous spell to you.

72
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,540
Thank you, Teacher, for the praise.

73
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:21,520
Has Teacher perhaps realized my identity, and knows that I'm the daughter of the Fox Emperor?

74
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,830
What's wrong?

75
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,620
Nothing, Teacher.

76
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,510
You can begin.

77
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,460
Break through the heavenly formation.

78
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:19,670
Those who can take the heads of the enemy's highest ranking generals will be promoted.

79
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,750
- Charge!
- Charge!

80
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,770
High Immortal, they have broken through the formation!

81
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:04,750
Impossible. How could they break through the formation so quickly?

82
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,410
Second Older Brother, don't go.

83
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,000
I can't watch Ah Yin die.

84
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,970
Second Older Brother, you clearly know that...

85
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,960
Second Brother, you clearly know that they're bound to lose.

86
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,660
Why did you still go?

87
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,430
Was what Eldest Brother said true...

88
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,940
that the person you like is Si Yin?

89
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,810
Ninth Senior Brother!

90
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,370
Seventeenth!

91
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:03,070
Seventeenth! Don't come near!

92
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,940
Senior Brother!

93
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,920
Senior Brother!

94
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,640
Senior Brother? Senior Brother!

95
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:56,640
Senior Brother! Senior Brother! Senior Brother!

96
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,090
Seventeenth, hurry and leave.

97
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:04,770
Senior Brother! Senior Brother, hold on!

98
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:08,730
Senior Brother, wake up! Senior Brother!

99
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:13,170
Senior Brother! Senior Brother! I'll take you out of this place.

100
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,840
I'm sure Teacher can save you.

101
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:19,940
Senior Brother! Senior Brother!

102
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:24,460
High Immortal Si Yin,

103
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:30,130
you should first worry about if you can escape.

104
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,530
Li Jing!

105
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,230
How dare you betray us?

106
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:48,850
My wife broke through this formation, so naturally, the merit belongs to me.

107
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:53,370
Why? I don't even have the right to protect one person?

108
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,050
Fine, then. You're right.

109
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:03,980
It's true that Xuan Nü rendered a meritorious service by helping you steal the formation map

110
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,770
so that you could reap the benefits.

111
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:09,910
But right now, since you dare to openly protect the enemy,

112
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,630
I have the right to execute you on the spot.

113
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,500
What did he just say?

114
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,070
Ah Yin, I'll tell you about this in the future.

115
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:23,220
Li Jing, you asked Xuan Nü to steal Kunlun Void's battle formation map?!

116
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,260
Ah Yin, I—

117
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,940
High God.

118
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,420
Teacher! Teacher!

119
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:14,000
Teacher, save Ninth Senior Brother quickly. Teacher.

120
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:26,190
Send a message to Die Feng.

121
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:31,230
Ask him to bring Ling Yu's corpse back to Kunlun Void.

122
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,150
Teacher!

123
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:44,850
Even you can't save Ninth Senior Brother?

124
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:48,100
Ninth Senior Brother! Ninth Senior Brother!

125
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,250
I'm sorry, Seventeenth.

126
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:54,110
This time, even I can do nothing.

127
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,890
It's all my fault. Teacher, it's all my fault.

128
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:04,320
If I had discovered it sooner,

129
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,790
Ninth Senior Brother wouldn't have died.

130
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:10,350
This isn't your fault.

131
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:13,100
It's because they broke through the battle formation.

132
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:17,460
Teacher, the battle formation was broken because of Xuan Nü.

133
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,690
Xuan Nü had stolen the formation map.

134
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,120
What did you say?

135
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:30,850
It was because Xuan Nü stole the formation map and gave it to Qing Cang.

136
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:38,770
Mo Yuan, once we set the formation, there is no point of return.

137
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:40,580
Then we...?

138
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,730
Not only will we...

139
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:50,710
suffer a crushing defeat,

140
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:55,940
we will also let the 200,000 heavenly soldiers lose their lives at Ruoshui Riverside.

141
00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:00,230
High God! High God, after the Winged Tribe broke the formation,

142
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,440
they immediately set a strange formation that trapped my army!

143
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:06,060
- High God!
- High God! Our Left Yuhou Army has been breached with a great number of casualties.

144
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:10,140
High God! Our left and back armies have been breached with a great number of casualties, too!

145
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,620
Thank you, High God, for extending a helping hand.

146
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:21,240
High God, are you of the Fox Tribe?

147
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,870
I am Bai Zhen.

148
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,430
You are the fourth son of the Fox Emperor Bai Zhi?

149
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,910
Yes, I am.

150
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,800
You are not a general of the army for this war.

151
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,970
You need not stay here.

152
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:38,630
I hope you can take my little disciple away from the battle.

153
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:42,940
Okay, then I shall not disturb all of you here.

154
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,550
Si Yin.

155
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,250
Fourth Older Brother,

156
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,810
it was I who harmed Ninth Senior Brother.

157
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:11,940
If I didn't know Li Jing,

158
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,860
if I didn't agree to let Xuan Nü stay,

159
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,790
Ninth Senior Brother would not have died.

160
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:21,200
Young Fifth, with your logic,

161
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,900
I'm the one who let Xuan Nü look for you at Kunlun Void.

162
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,780
So do both of us have to pay with our lives then?

163
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:34,810
A few days ago, oldest sister-in-law sent a letter, saying she was satisfied with Xuan Nü's marriage.

164
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:37,460
She wanted me to thank you.

165
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:41,960
If not for oldest sister-in-law, I would have killed her earlier!

166
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:46,750
Since she has chosen the Winged Tribe, she has nothing to do with our Green Hill from now on.

167
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:50,980
In the future if you see her, you can kill her with one strike.

168
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,510
You need not feel soft-hearted.

169
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,650
It is what she deserves.

170
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,530
High God, my army requests to battle.

171
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:09,580
- High God, our armies request to battle, too.
- High God, our armies request to battle, too.

172
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,950
Princes, you need not rush to go to battle.

173
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:15,110
If you need someone to lead the army, my Kunlun Void still has sixteen disciples.

174
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:17,880
Since we have come here, we are not here for display.

175
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,650
We will willingly survive and die with you!

176
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:22,570
- We will willingly survive and die with you!
- We will willingly survive and die with you!

177
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:33,360
Right now, I need 10,000 people to sacrifice themselves.

178
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:36,110
Sacrifice?

179
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:40,110
That's right, to sacrifice.

180
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,980
The soldiers outside are all descendants of the Heavenly Tribe.

181
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:54,840
Although they are not as honorable as the royals, they still have lives.

182
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:00,070
High God, please reconsider.

183
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,760
The battle situation now is urgent.

184
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,700
We need to make a risky move to turn the tides.

185
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:13,380
If this plan works, everyone else will survive.

186
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:16,160
If we do not go with this plan,

187
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,680
I fear that this world will have a new master.

188
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,880
I'll then personally lead an army to make a void within the formation of the enemies.

189
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,560
But I need a valiant and highly skilled general

190
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:33,730
to lead these 10,000 soldiers to the southeast, break through the closure, and defeat the enemies.

191
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:36,880
If he can lure the 100,000 soldiers of the Winged Tribe to pursue them,

192
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,160
he can then gain one last chance at survival for us.

193
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:43,730
High God, I'm from the first branch of the Heavenly Tribe.

194
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:46,350
I just happen to have brought 10,000 soldiers with me.

195
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:50,620
My whole tribe is willing to help you create this opportunity at survival.

196
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,960
Are you from the Sujin Tribe?

197
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,360
- Correct. We're indeed from the Sujin Tribe.
- Good!

198
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,250
Mo Yuan.

199
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:15,590
In this tent, the only valiant generals skilled in fighting are you and me.

200
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:18,770
If you send an unknown general to lead an army,

201
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:21,930
I fear that Qing Cang will not believe it.

202
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,090
I'm willing to personally lead the 10,000 soldiers.

203
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:31,530
For you, I'm offering my life, too.

204
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,450
This path will lead straight to death for sure.

205
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:41,100
For all living things,

206
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:44,220
I'm willing to accept this duty.

207
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:50,140
Fourth Older Brother,

208
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:56,330
if we lose this battle, wouldn't Ninth Senior Brother's life be lost in vain?

209
00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:00,430
If Ninth Senior Brother's parents learn that he had lost his life by the Ruoshui Riverside,

210
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:02,850
how sad would they be?

211
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,750
Everyone will die.

212
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,830
It's just a matter of how soon.

213
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:13,420
He lived a regretless life, and he died a courageous death.

214
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:16,220
He died a worthy death.

215
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,910
I initially planned to just observe this battle from afar.

216
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:22,130
But turns out, everything went against our expectations.

217
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:26,130
- Fourth Older Brother, do you know the Donghuang Bell?
- I know.

218
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:28,790
I saw it when I was little.

219
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:31,850
But it has disappeared.

220
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,540
It's in Qing Cang's hands.

221
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,640
Really?!

222
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,300
That is indeed troublesome.

223
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:02,010
In an hour, just proceed according to the circumstances.

224
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:07,050
Remember. Once you've broken through the enclosure, pull the battlefront of the enemies as far from us as possible.

225
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:08,740
I understand.

226
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,860
Let's part here.

227
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:16,030
When I return, let's duel one more time.

228
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:18,510
No matter who wins or loses,

229
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:21,770
after the duel,

230
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,160
may all our past grudges be forgotten.

231
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:26,640
How about it?

232
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:29,130
Okay.

233
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:39,340
Everyone, I, Yao Guang, will go on ahead.

234
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,800
Respectfully sending off High Goddess!

235
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:10,220
I've set up seven formations.

236
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,770
Now, one general has died.

237
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,620
One general is leading an army to lure the enemy.

238
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:16,100
I still need two new generals to lead a troop.

239
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,710
We are both leading a troop.

240
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:23,820
If we ask for generals from the Heavenly Monarch now, it will be too late.

241
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:27,160
Teacher, I volunteer.

242
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:32,860
You've never led your own army, Seventeenth.

243
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,120
I've followed you for 20,000 years.

244
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,440
I've long etched the formation in my mind.

245
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,640
Teacher, please believe in me.

246
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,280
High God, I'm also willing to lead an army.

247
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,630
You?

248
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:53,820
In this great war, in terms of magical power, I think that I'm second to you.

249
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:57,930
Okay. You two will each lead an army.

250
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:01,050
Si Yin will lead the Left Yuhou Army of High Goddess Yao Guang.

251
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:04,240
- Bai Zhen, you will lead the front army of Ling Yu.
- Yes!

252
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,660
Later, I will follow my plan with High Goddess Yao Guang

253
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,240
to lead the middle army in breaking through the southeastern corner of the enemy lines,

254
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,390
so High Goddess Yao Guang can break through the enclosure and escape.

255
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:16,970
At this time, Yang Cuo, Sang Ji, and Lian Song, you three will pretend to not want to fight.

256
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:19,070
You will keep on retreating while you fight them.

257
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,930
High God, Qing Cang has changed his battle formation.

258
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:57,890
He transferred at least 10,000 soldiers to chase after High Goddess Yao Guang.

259
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,090
Okay.

260
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:11,060
Take Qing Cang's head as a sacrifice to the brave soldiers of the Heavenly Tribe who sacrificed their lives!

261
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:15,490
Take Qing Cang's head as a sacrifice to the brave soldiers of the Heavenly Tribe who sacrificed their lives!

262
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:20,810
Take Qing Cang's head as a sacrifice to the brave soldiers of the Heavenly Tribe who sacrificed their lives!

263
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,220
Qing Cang,

264
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:14,400
if you surrender without a fight, your subordinates might have a chance of surviving.

265
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:20,610
But if you don't surrender, then prepare to give your life to my Heavenly Tribe's soldiers who died in battle.

266
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:29,190
As long as I am the Winged Tribe's monarch, I will never surrender.

267
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:33,340
It's time to change the master of this world.

268
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:38,440
In this battle, if the gods of the Eight Wildernesses can die with me,

269
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,190
then my death won't be in vain.

270
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:04,680
Mo Yuan, do you recognize this?

271
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,860
Donghuang Bell?

272
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:08,830
You created this Donghuang Bell.

273
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:13,450
Today, you can die because of it.

274
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,050
Si Yin!

275
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,200
Catch him!

276
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:00,220
Si Yin.

277
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,560
Qing Cang, since I created the Donghuang Bell,

278
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,090
then I naturally know how to control it.

279
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:21,060
Teacher!

280
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:30,020
- Seventeenth, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

281
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,070
Wait for me.

282
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,240
Teacher.

283
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,620
Teacher.

284
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:43,190
Teacher!

285
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,830
Teacher! Teacher!

286
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,590
- Teacher!
- Seventeenth!

287
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:09,880
Teacher!

288
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,700
Teacher!

289
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,240
Teacher!

290
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,390
Teacher!

291
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:23,020
Teacher!

292
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,240
- Teacher!
- Teacher!

293
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:51,550
Teacher!

294
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:56,030
Teacher!

295
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:02,980
Immortals, this is the Winged Tribe's letter of surrender.

296
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:05,480
My father is already sealed within the Donghuang Bell.

297
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,580
The Winged Tribe does not want to be the Heavenly Tribe's enemy.

298
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:14,410
I hope you will accept the letter of surrender, and spare the lives of our 30,000 remaining soldiers.

299
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:29,020
What's the use of a letter of surrender?

300
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:35,240
I will make you all die!

301
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:40,410
- Seventeenth! Seventeenth!
- Seventeenth, stop!

302
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:43,800
This involves all common people in this world. Don't be reckless!

303
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,450
My Winged Tribe has over 100,000 members. You can't kill us all!

304
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:52,580
Even if I dedicate my whole life to it, I will annihilate your entire tribe!

305
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:56,310
High Immortal, it's inevitable that lives are lost in battle.

306
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:58,360
After all, my father is already sealed inside.

307
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:01,160
Please stop implicating others.

308
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,670
Let go of me!

309
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:06,460
- Si Yin!
- Seventeenth!

310
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:10,420
Let's go back to Kunlun Void.

311
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,990
What did you say?

312
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:31,050
High God Mo Yuan used his spirit as a sacrifice to the Donghuang Bell.

313
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:34,010
His soul has shattered.

314
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:45,380
Okay, I got it.

315
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,920
Wait.

316
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,340
Emperor, what other orders do you have?

317
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:58,390
No matter what, Qing Cang is also sealed.

318
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:00,120
Hurry and go to the Grand Purple Palace.

319
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,570
Do not delay this.

320
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,650
Yes.

321
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:41,670
Here, have some fruits.

322
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:43,730
Get lost!

323
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,960
For Your Highness, I was heavily beaten and severely injured.

324
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,310
I also stole the battle formation from Kunlun Void for Your Highness.

325
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:57,840
The loss happened because it's your father's fate.

326
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,920
Why do Your Highness still treat me this way?

327
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:05,820
What does win or lose have anything to do with me?

328
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:11,250
Also, what does your doing have anything to do with me?

329
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:15,380
Why isn't it your business?

330
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:20,130
Now that the Winged Tribe has lost and Mo Yuan has died for it,

331
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:23,080
I've become a sinner to Kunlun Void.

332
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:30,550
From now on, of Heaven and Earth, Your Highness is the only one I can rely on.

333
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:36,530
Xuan Nü, do you know that you're relying on the wrong person?

334
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:42,130
In the Winged Tribe, I have no power or rights.

335
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,760
I'm also always at odds with my eldest brother.

336
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:52,280
Now that my father has died, once my brother ascends the throne, I'll die very soon.

337
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,660
You'll rely on me?

338
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:57,270
Then, whom should I rely on?

339
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:01,840
Your Second Highness.

340
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,780
What happened?

341
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,230
Someone from the Heavenly Tribe is here.

342
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,950
Bring him inside.

343
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:13,520
Yes, Your Highness.

344
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:22,070
I am Star Monarch Si Ming. Greetings, Your Second Highness.

345
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:25,610
Didn't my eldest brother already hand over the letter of surrender?

346
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:28,500
Why are you, a Heavenly Tribesman, coming to find me?

347
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:33,330
I'm here to help Your Second Highness seize the throne of the Winged Monarch.

348
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:36,110
Throne of the Winged Monarch?

349
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,690
I'm not interested at all.

350
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:40,330
You should leave.

351
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:50,110
Your Second Highness, if the first prince ascends the throne, you may only be able to survive till tomorrow.

352
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:52,810
Moreover, he killed your mother.

353
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:56,490
How can you give up before you get revenge?

354
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:07,150
How could Teacher...?

355
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,080
Teacher.

356
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:47,020
Teacher? Teacher!

357
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:50,660
Teacher!

358
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,320
Teacher.

359
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:58,230
Zhe Yan, when will my teacher regain consciousness?

360
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:28,210
”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

361
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:30,220
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

362
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:32,920
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

363
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:38,250
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

364
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:46,850
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

365
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:51,550
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

366
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:56,900
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

367
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:02,020
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

368
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:09,020
♫ All are just illusions ♫

369
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:15,870
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

370
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:21,100
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

371
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:25,530
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

372
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:31,740
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

373
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:37,220
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

374
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:42,370
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

375
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:45,230
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

376
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:54,030
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from my previous life ♫

377
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:06,300
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

378
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:11,700
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

379
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:16,140
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories, ♫

380
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:22,390
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

381
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:27,760
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

382
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:33,280
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

383
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,810
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

384
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:44,940
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

385
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:56,770
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
