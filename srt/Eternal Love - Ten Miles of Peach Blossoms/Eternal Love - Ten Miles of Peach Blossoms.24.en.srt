”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,530
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:21,180
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,710
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,940
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,410
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,140
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,780
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,280
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,960
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,370
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:53,310
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,480
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,070
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:03,550
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:07,010
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:10,560
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,260
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,960
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,840
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,260
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,610
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:27,760
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,920
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,330
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:38,950
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:42,110
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:46,630
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,010
[Episode 24]

31
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:36,970
Your eyesight has never meant anything special to him.

32
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,540
Su Jin?

33
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,790
It's me, Su Su.

34
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,250
How is your recovery from your injury?

35
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,220
Does it still hurt?

36
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,000
I trusted you very much.

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,050
Why would you frame me?

38
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:01,510
Not only did you hurt your own eyes, but you also made me lose mine, too.

39
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,690
How will this benefit you?

40
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,780
It's true you can't see,

41
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:12,280
but I can see now.

42
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:22,360
I'm here to tell you that I'm using your eyes very well.

43
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:29,550
You're using... my eyes?!

44
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,120
Didn't Ye Hua tell you?

45
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,330
He took your eyes for me to use.

46
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,170
When Medicine King changed my eyes,

47
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:52,490
Ye Hua took care of me for an entire day.

48
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:56,600
How can you understand our relationship?

49
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,620
You can keep living in the Courtyard of Moonlight,

50
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:17,120
but you should remember... this is a gift from me, Ye Hua's future side consort Su Jin, to you.

51
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:34,340
This was between them originally.

52
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:46,320
I was just a passerby... who cluelessly got dragged in and became their stumbling block.

53
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,630
How dare you!

54
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,320
Watch this courtyard well.

55
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,310
Although she doesn't have a status, she's still His Highness the Crown Prince's woman.

56
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:04,720
If there are any mistakes, I will interrogate you.

57
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,470
Yes, Consort Su Jin.

58
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,960
Your Highness, are you okay?

59
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,180
This creature raised by the mortal is wild and untamed.

60
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,290
Go and beat this beast to death.

61
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,810
Yes.

62
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:42,370
Consort Su Jin.

63
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,460
Didn't you already go down to the divine mountain in the lower realm?

64
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:55,250
Your Highness, Consort Le Xu has allowed me to wait until the little prince has reached one year of age before demoting me.

65
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:00,040
Does this fox belong to the Courtyard of Moonlight?

66
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:08,190
Your Highness, this fox does come often, but it's not My Lady's.

67
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:11,220
I clearly saw it come out of there.

68
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,250
You even dare to lie for a beast?

69
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:18,370
- This fox is definitely not My—
- How presumptuous!

70
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:32,340
- Emperor.
- I lost my little fox.

71
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,230
Has Your Highness seen it?

72
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,460
Little fox?

73
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:42,580
It's the one your servant is holding.

74
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:46,630
Tell me. Who hurt it?

75
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:52,910
Emperor, it bit Her Highness's wrist.

76
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:57,520
Her Highness only threw it to protect herself.

77
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,860
It was disobedient?

78
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:07,400
No way, it must have been unintentional.

79
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,450
So was it intentional or not?

80
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:15,170
Unintentional. It must be.

81
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:17,720
I was probably in its way,

82
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,990
so its mood was unstable and it was irritated.

83
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,050
It's not a big injury.

84
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:27,620
If it's your fox, I will return it.

85
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:48,720
Since you said that it injured you, I won't be partial towards it.

86
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:53,980
Why not tell me what just happened?

87
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:56,260
The fox...

88
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:01,210
Isn't this the Crown Prince's mortal wife's living chambers?

89
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:05,670
I heard something minor happened a few days ago

90
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:08,730
and now you two aren't on good terms.

91
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:13,910
Why don't you go inside with me and ask that mortal

92
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:21,070
why this fox was provoked and learned to bite.

93
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,930
Emperor, you must be joking.

94
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:24,710
It was just a small bite.

95
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,570
How could it be worth your investigation?

96
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:30,780
It bit me and I hurt it.

97
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:34,320
We're even.

98
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,470
We're even?

99
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,150
It looks more injured than you.

100
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,810
How is it even?

101
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,780
Emperor, please appease your anger.

102
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,180
It was all my fault.

103
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,330
What did you say?

104
00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:01,300
I saw that mortal in the Courtyard of Moonlight and I was in a bad mood.

105
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:05,950
This small fox just happened to be playing here,

106
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:09,350
yet I hurt it for no reason.

107
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:13,530
Hurt it for no reason?

108
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,880
Please don't be angry.

109
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:22,060
I was moody and irritated and hurt this fox from Early Dawn Palace.

110
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:33,590
I'm willing to kneel for two hours to pay for my sin.

111
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,650
That'd be great.

112
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:38,140
You grew up here in Nine Heavens.

113
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:44,900
I'm sure you've heard that in the old days, I used to command troops, so I'm protective and unreasonable.

114
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:55,040
Please stay away from my people and my fox in the future.

115
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,300
I understand.

116
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:08,730
- Your Highness, please get up.
- No need.

117
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:13,460
If anyone tells the Emperor, it'll cause more trouble.

118
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,160
No matter what, you are still a Heavenly Consort.

119
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,350
You don't need to yield to him.

120
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,600
What do you know?

121
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,770
Although the Emperor never meddles with Heavenly Palace affairs,

122
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:28,390
if he speaks, no one can disobey him.

123
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:32,140
It's obvious he was angry just now.

124
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,860
Even if Heavenly Monarch were here, he couldn't help me.

125
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:39,530
He might even punish me by making me kneel an entire day.

126
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,080
Xin Nu,

127
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,190
I finally got to where I am today.

128
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:51,400
I will have to endure as much anger as I can.

129
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:57,100
As long as I can enter Pure Wutong Palace without any hitches,

130
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,680
I don't care about anything else.

131
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:10,600
Your Highness, if His Highness the Crown Prince knew your sincerity towards him, that would be great.

132
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,690
He will know sooner or later.

133
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:32,000
This is the memorial scroll submitted by the sub-tribe chieftains and feudal princes from the Four Seas.

134
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,720
Ye Hua has won the hearts of many people from the battle at Northern Wilderness.

135
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,200
They are petitioning me to let Ye Hua officially hold the crown prince seal.

136
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,500
Congratulations, Eldest Brother and Father Monarch.

137
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,590
Once Ye Hua officially accepts the crown prince seal,

138
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:47,130
he will be able to help you two with the big and small problems in court.

139
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:51,100
He didn't disappoint me. He didn't disappoint me.

140
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,390
In this world, there is something called tribulation.

141
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:21,590
Whether immortal or mortal, we all have our own tribulations.

142
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,920
You can't help her and she can't help you.

143
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,300
Heavenly Monarch.

144
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,470
Emperor.

145
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,770
Heavenly Monarch, it seems like you have happy news.

146
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:55,520
These couple of days I have received quite a few scrolls.

147
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:00,980
Most of what was submitted wanted His Highness the Crown Prince to hurry and finish the coronation.

148
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,200
Is that so?

149
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,100
Then congratulations, Heavenly Monarch.

150
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,320
His Highness the Crown Prince didn't disappoint you.

151
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,560
He won the hearts of all the people in all the realms.

152
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,420
Yes, I am very pleased.

153
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:20,420
Didn't you already start sending government affairs to the Purple Morning Hall 20,000 years ago?

154
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,850
When the Crown Prince accepts the seal, you can be like me,

155
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:28,800
stand aloof and stop worrying about matters of the palace.

156
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:33,210
You are right.

157
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:36,780
For the past decade,

158
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:41,370
I have been feeling my strength fall short of my intentions.

159
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,060
Let's prepare Ye Hua's coronation ceremony for early next month.

160
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,910
Thank you, Heavenly Monarch.

161
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,880
Rise.

162
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,400
Ye Hua,

163
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,210
I must congratulate you.

164
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,560
Thank you, Third Uncle.

165
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,720
Ye Hua.

166
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,280
Father Monarch has always had high hopes for you.

167
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:34,220
After your coronation, you must act and speak cautiously and take over Father Monarch's doctrine as the leader.

168
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,000
I will follow your teachings, Father.

169
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:56,010
Nai Nai, this lotus smells good.

170
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:01,760
If you like it, I'll take you here to smell it every day.

171
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,350
My Lady, Heavenly Monarch has decreed that you are not allowed to step out from the Courtyard of Moonlight.

172
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:34,990
You slept for a long time.

173
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,490
Nai Nai,

174
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,250
what day is it?

175
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,530
Why am I so drowsy?

176
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:48,900
It must be because you're pregnant, so you are extra sleepy.

177
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:54,490
My Lady, His Highness the Crown Prince is here to visit you.

178
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,090
Ye Hua is here?

179
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:06,160
Are the stars bright tonight?

180
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:14,220
Su Su, did you forget that the Heavenly Palace has no nighttime?

181
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,720
I am going to be crowned the Crown Prince soon.

182
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,260
We can get married soon.

183
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:29,080
Once you are the Crown Prince Consort, we don't need to care about what others say.

184
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,400
We can start to live our own lives.

185
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:44,250
I know you're busy so you should go.

186
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,110
I'm sleepy.

187
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:48,520
I'll go back to sleep.

188
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:54,180
I heard from Medicine King you've been sleeping a lot recently.

189
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,110
Yes.

190
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:01,130
Rest up.

191
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,710
In a few days, I will accept the crown prince seal.

192
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:35,950
I must suffer thirty-six strikes of uncultivated fire and nine strikes of heavenly lightning.

193
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:39,940
If Su Su hears the sound of thunder, don't tell her the truth.

194
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:42,380
I'm afraid that she might worry.

195
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,300
Yes.

196
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,440
It doesn't matter if you don't eat.

197
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,360
I will get someone to extend your life.

198
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,410
I guarantee that you won't die.

199
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:36,430
If I knew this day would come, I wouldn't have...

200
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,190
Shouldn't have what?

201
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,300
Shouldn't have spared me?

202
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:46,150
Or should you have killed me when you killed my mother?

203
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:51,090
That's right.

204
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:57,850
My biggest regret is not killing you when I had the chance 70,000 years ago!

205
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,150
Let me tell you.

206
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,460
Don't think that Father Monarch really loved you.

207
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:19,930
You are just a venomous insect that he raised.

208
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,840
What do you mean?

209
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:33,210
You, me, and Yan Zhi.

210
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:35,030
We are his sons and daughter,

211
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:39,830
the Winged Tribe's princes and princess,

212
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:42,230
and also his lifesaving talisman.

213
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:49,650
No matter who dies among the three of us, his powers will increase.

214
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:55,400
We are just blood-related venomous insects that he uses to train his martial arts.

215
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:01,010
My mother found this secret when she gave birth to me.

216
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:07,360
That's why he threw her into the cold palace and you had a chance to kill her.

217
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,830
Believe me.

218
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:18,270
As soon as you save Father Monarch, we're the first to die.

219
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:23,660
Then his powers would increase greatly and he would get revenge on the Heavenly Tribe.

220
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:28,440
That's not possible!

221
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,050
He wouldn't do that to me for sure!

222
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:39,850
What is impossible in this Grand Purple Palace?

223
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:45,870
So as long as I am alive, I will also keep you alive.

224
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:54,980
From today on, you will be trapped in here day and night.

225
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,930
You won't see the lights of day again.

226
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:59,810
I'll kill you!

227
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,150
Winged Monarch.

228
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,100
Second Older Brother.

229
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,870
It's late. Why aren't you resting?

230
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:57,620
I want to leave the Winged Realm for the Mortal Realm.

231
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,590
Yan Zhi,

232
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:12,710
you're my only younger sister.

233
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:17,210
I can forgive you for all your past betrayal.

234
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:24,070
I just want you to live well here in the Grand Purple Palace as the princess royal.

235
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:28,290
Don't think about saving Eldest Brother or Father Monarch anymore.

236
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:36,340
Eldest Brother, you, and I grew up together in this Grand Purple Palace.

237
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,770
You are both dear to me.

238
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:44,320
You want me to not care, but I can't do it.

239
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:49,290
But I don't want to betray you anymore.

240
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,980
So please let me go.

241
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,420
Let me leave here.

242
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:20,510
Leave.

243
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:23,250
Remember.

244
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:30,700
Stay safe no matter where you go.

245
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,540
Listen up.

246
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,730
Follow the princess royal.

247
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:15,420
You will serve her now.

248
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:21,090
Protecting her is your only mission.

249
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:23,090
Yes.

250
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:19,090
Mighty Monarch, drinking too much will harm the body.

251
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:22,150
You should drink less.

252
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,140
Child,

253
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,450
you're my only family left.

254
00:25:53,450 --> 00:26:00,170
Mighty Monarch, you still have me besides our child.

255
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:29,880
Ah Yin.

256
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,500
Ah Yin?

257
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,640
Why do you only care about her?

258
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:42,280
Si Yin, you better not appear again.

259
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:47,340
Otherwise, I'll pull out your tendons and skin you alive.

260
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,820
Northern Sea Water Monarch. Eastern Sea Water Monarch.

261
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,390
Southern Sea Water Monarch.

262
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:59,830
Northern Sea Water Monarch.

263
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,410
Winged Monarch.

264
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:17,070
It seems like the monarchs of the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses have gathered together.

265
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:19,340
Correct, correct.

266
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,510
The Crown Prince of the Heavenly Tribe accepting the seal is a big event.

267
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:23,750
Naturally, we have to come.

268
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,850
Winged Monarch.

269
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:40,650
I heard Your Highness has been arranged to marry the Crown Prince.

270
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:43,420
Winged Monarch, you are well informed.

271
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,660
I still have to bring clothes to Consort Le Xu.

272
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:48,510
I can't stay and talk more with you.

273
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,320
- Your Highness.
- Yes?

274
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,050
Do you have something to say?

275
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:58,370
I wanted to ask something.

276
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:02,960
How is the noble lady from the Courtyard of Moonlight doing?

277
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:07,930
Are you asking about Younger Sister Su Su?

278
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:09,950
That's right.

279
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:15,110
- She...
- She caused Her Highness to go blind.

280
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:18,350
You're asking the wrong person.

281
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:22,590
Shut it. How dare you speak in front of the Winged Monarch?

282
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,930
Your eyes?!

283
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:26,730
It's a long story.

284
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:29,770
I believe it was unintentional.

285
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:32,480
She's now waiting to give birth at the Courtyard of Moonlight.

286
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,590
She's going to give birth soon.

287
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,870
Because my fire kirin has also injured her before,

288
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:43,930
I have always felt guilty about it.

289
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:47,720
Since I came to the Heavenly Palace, I just wanted to ask about her.

290
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,330
Please don't mind me, Your Highness.

291
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:05,000
Look at how knowledgeable Consort Su Jin is.

292
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,970
Yes, yes. No wonder Heavenly Monarch married her to His Highness the Crown Prince.

293
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:14,160
Only such a woman is worthy of assisting Heavenly Tribe's ruler.

294
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,960
Yes.

295
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,940
Fire Kirin.

296
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:23,400
Check to see if she's still in the Courtyard of Moonlight.

297
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,350
Yes.

298
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,910
My Lady, why did you secretly come out again?

299
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:43,460
Medicine King said that your health hasn't been good recently.

300
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:47,030
You need to be careful. You can't catch a cold.

301
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:52,330
I just wanted some sun.

302
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:59,070
The warm sun on the back of my hand feels nice.

303
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:04,110
It's as if I can see the light again.

304
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:07,870
My Lady...

305
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,400
You may go.

306
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:41,280
Grandson Ye Hua is awarded the precious scroll and imperial seal,

307
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:45,740
conferring him as the Crown Prince and his palace as the Eastern Palace.

308
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:51,870
He is entrusted with the heavy responsibility of governing the Four Seas and connecting the hearts of the Eight Wildernesses!

309
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,800
His palace as the Eastern Palace.

310
00:32:54,800 --> 00:33:01,460
He is entrusted with the heavy responsibility of governing the Four Seas and connecting the hearts of the Eight Wildernesses!

311
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:42,540
Congratulations, Your Highness the Crown Prince.

312
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:17,720
My Lady! My Lady!

313
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,350
My Lady, it's His Highness the Crown Prince's coronation ceremony today.

314
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:23,630
I heard from the other servant-maids of Pure Wutong Palace that Heavenly Monarch decreed

315
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:29,450
that Heavenly Consort Su Jin will be bestowed to His Highness the Crown Prince after the coronation ceremony.

316
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,610
This was going to happen sooner or later.

317
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:36,170
But Consort Su Jin has a grudge against you.

318
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:40,650
If she moves into Pure Wutong Palace, she might harm you.

319
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,250
That won't happen.

320
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:47,710
In any case, Pure Wutong Palace has nothing to do with me now.

321
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:51,660
My Lady, if His Highness heard that, he wouldn't be happy.

322
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,770
In the future, try not to say things like that.

323
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:58,920
Nai Nai, why am I hearing thunder?

324
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:04,150
That's... to celebrate His Highness the Crown Prince.

325
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:13,190
Are you all right?

326
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:16,380
I think I'm about to give birth.

327
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,660
I'll go find His Highness the Crown Prince! I'll go find His Highness the Crown Prince!

328
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:21,880
Don't go, Nai Nai! Don't go.

329
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,990
Don't go.

330
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,590
What should I do?

331
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:44,160
It's three months early, and you're bleeding heavily.

332
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,520
Your Highness, you must not force yourself to give birth.

333
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,040
If you can't protect my child,

334
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,870
you're dead!

335
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,930
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

336
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:57,670
The royal family is the base of the Winged Realm.

337
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:00,050
If His Mighty Monarch finds out that I used a forbidden spell

338
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:04,420
to extend the life of the prince in your womb and deceive His Mighty Monarch,

339
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:07,590
I will die for sure.

340
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:12,050
This spell is forbidden because it's dangerous and goes against Heaven's will.

341
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:13,320
You are having a premature birth today.

342
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:17,110
It clearly means that it's going against Heaven's will, Your Highness.

343
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:21,220
Don't try to keep this child. Let this child go.

344
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,880
Continue with the delivery.

345
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:28,450
Regardless of any methods, you must get him out of my womb!

346
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:30,140
He lives, you live.

347
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,880
He dies, you die!

348
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,550
Your Highness.

349
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:56,130
Congratulations, Your Highness the Crown Prince, for being awarded the official seal.

350
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:07,280
- Stand.
- Thank you, Your Highness.

351
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:14,260
Congratulations, Your Highness the Crown Prince.

352
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,010
- Mighty Monarch.
- Mighty Monarch.

353
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:32,520
What's wrong? Why are you so frantic?

354
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,560
Speak first. Did something happen in the Winged Realm?

355
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,910
- Congratulations, Mighty Monarch. Monarchess has given birth.
- Is this true?

356
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:43,160
It was last night. Monarchess ordered me to request that you go back.

357
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,360
Let's go!

358
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:21,150
- Mighty Monarch.
- Mighty Monarch.

359
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:22,700
What's wrong?

360
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,040
Monarchess is going into labor early. It's very dangerous.

361
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:29,030
The shaman said no one is allowed in.

362
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:31,340
All right.

363
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:34,010
I'll wait here.

364
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,910
Congratulations, Your Highness the Crown Prince, for receiving the seal today.

365
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:05,080
I think that Your Highness can come tomorrow instead.

366
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,870
No need.

367
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:10,910
No one can defy Heavenly Monarch's decree.

368
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:16,930
All right. Your Highness, please ascend the Platform of Punishment.

369
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:24,380
”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

370
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,430
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

371
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:28,970
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

372
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:34,420
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

373
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:43,350
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

374
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:47,700
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

375
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:53,070
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

376
00:42:53,070 --> 00:43:00,390
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

377
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:05,160
♫ All are just illusions ♫

378
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:12,020
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

379
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:17,230
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

380
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:21,740
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

381
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:27,890
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

382
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:33,350
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

383
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:38,550
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

384
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:41,350
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

385
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:50,300
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from my previous life ♫

386
00:43:57,310 --> 00:44:02,480
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

387
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:07,990
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

388
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:12,370
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

389
00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:18,750
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

390
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:23,940
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

391
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:29,310
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

392
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:31,860
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

393
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:41,010
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

394
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:53,720
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
