”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

2
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,580
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,080
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,620
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,130
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:31,390
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:35,170
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,750
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,020
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,880
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,420
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,990
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:56,460
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,000
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,550
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:07,050
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:10,570
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:14,150
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,960
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,790
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,260
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,810
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,010
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:31,800
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,520
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,910
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,080
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,050
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

29
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:04,940
[Eternal Love]

30
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,990
[Episode 31]

31
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,750
I finally got rid of that father and son.

32
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,890
Tonight, I'll just look for someplace to rest, here in the northern bank.

33
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,640
I'll go to Fourth Older Brother's manor tomorrow to deliver the wine.

34
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,560
- Ah Li is asleep?
- Yes.

35
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,510
He usually falls asleep around this hour.

36
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,710
You've been acting as both parents for all this time.

37
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,140
It's been hard on you.

38
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:06,030
I still haven't thanked you for saving my life.

39
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,550
I thought that you would never thank me.

40
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,110
Why?

41
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,620
Three hundred years ago, even though I saved you,

42
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,040
I wasn't able to wake you up.

43
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,160
That time, you were in severe despair and didn't want to live.

44
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,830
Since you didn't want to live anymore, why are you thanking me now?

45
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,560
But from the look of it now, you have a new drive to keep living.

46
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,610
Come. Taste this, my peach blossoms wine.

47
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,010
Say it.

48
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:58,400
Why did you come here today?

49
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:01,340
Bai Qian of Green Hill.

50
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:07,780
Three hundred years ago, I set this engagement between you two in the main hall of the Heavenly Palace.

51
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,210
You didn't seem interested at that time.

52
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:12,780
Now, you are?

53
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,320
I have three questions.

54
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:22,680
Which three? Say it and let's see if I can answer.

55
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,590
Why are Bai Qian's eyes that afraid of strong light?

56
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:28,070
Did they get injured?

57
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:32,220
It was congenital.

58
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:39,950
Three hundred years ago, after her fight with Qing Cang,

59
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:43,240
is it true that she went into a coma for several years because of grave injuries?

60
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:48,660
Of course, it's true. The whole Four Seas know it.

61
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,350
What?

62
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,960
You don't believe it?

63
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,000
Look at how old I am. I'm an old phoenix.

64
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,270
Why would I lie to a young one like you?

65
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:03,480
It's true. It's true.

66
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:07,380
Seeing how High God Zhe Yan is responding, it doesn't seem to be a lie.

67
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,420
Could it be...? No, it can't.

68
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,970
Even if all her actions were just coincidental, her scar can't be fake.

69
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:17,260
No one can remove a scar left by the Red Lotus Fire.

70
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:21,000
What's the third question?

71
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,200
Has she ever forgotten anything?

72
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,210
How did you know?

73
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:28,140
She really has amnesia?

74
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,400
You said it too seriously. It's not amnesia.

75
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:36,510
It's just that when she was asleep, a lot happened that she doesn't know about.

76
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:43,510
Why do you think that she has lost her memories?

77
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,750
I was overthinking.

78
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,130
Does this lad know something?

79
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:53,850
Could he be the one that Bai Qian wanted to forget?

80
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:58,050
Oh right, Ye Hua, I also have a question for you.

81
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,980
High God, please say it.

82
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:05,790
Since the first time I met you, you've been wearing a black robe.

83
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:08,400
Until now, it's still the same.

84
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,940
I find it really weird.

85
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:16,750
For a young man like you, why would you like a dark gloomy color?

86
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:23,470
This color is indeed not pleasing to the eyes but it's very practical.

87
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:25,830
If one day, I get hacked by someone,

88
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,040
my blood might soak my clothes but others wouldn't see it.

89
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,550
They would only think that I'd fallen into the pond.

90
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,890
If others can't see it,

91
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:39,100
my enemies won't feel happy not knowing they'd hurt me,

92
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,050
and the people around me also wouldn't worry because of it.

93
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:47,710
At this aspect, you and Mo Yuan are very much alike.

94
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:55,240
Sometimes, even I would ponder if you are Mo Yuan or not.

95
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,310
I'm not.

96
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,210
I'm not Mo Yuan.

97
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,040
Come.

98
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:38,030
Mighty Monarch, you're awake.

99
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,860
What time is it?

100
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,540
You only slept for an hour.

101
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:47,710
Do men from the Winged Realm all have good alcohol tolerance?

102
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,090
For others, I don't know.

103
00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:00,020
But I was able to train my alcohol tolerance

104
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,940
for the past 70,000 years.

105
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:07,820
Mighty Monarch, stop looking like you've lost your heart.

106
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:13,230
Since we were fated to meet, let's be like a short-lived couple.

107
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,820
You have me in your eyes.

108
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:22,030
You probably also have me in your heart.

109
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,690
Although this forest isn't as good as Zhe Yan's, it's good enough to block off the wind.

110
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,760
I'll sleep in this underbrush for the night.

111
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,880
Ah Yin.

112
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,280
Where have you been for all these years?

113
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,540
So it's Winged Monarch Li Jing.

114
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:32,890
Ah Yin, don't talk to me like that.

115
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:37,070
I'd broken off our relationship a long time ago.

116
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,280
I don't dare be "Ah Yin."

117
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,590
Please call me by my title.

118
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:53,230
Ah Yin, you've hidden from me for 70,000 years.

119
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:56,270
How much longer are you going to hide from me?

120
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:59,980
I've been searching for you for so long.

121
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,370
I was wrong.

122
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:04,430
I made a grave mistake, Ah Yin.

123
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,170
I searched all over Kunlun Void and the Heavenly Tribe.

124
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,980
I know you blame me.

125
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,450
You said the Grand Purple Palace was an irreconcilable enemy. You know I-

126
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:25,430
You've been wasting your efforts.

127
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:29,410
Everything I said before was out of anger.

128
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:32,590
The Heavenly Tribe and the Winged Tribe are amicable now.

129
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,080
I'm not a fool.

130
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,580
I've lived long enough to know better.

131
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:42,210
Of course, I won't be running amok the Grand Purple Palace stirring up trouble.

132
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,940
What do you mean?

133
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,720
You don't even blame me anymore?

134
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,940
Why would I blame someone I don't care for?

135
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:54,390
Let's go our separate ways from now on.

136
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,520
No, Ah Yin.

137
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,080
At least hear me out.

138
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,800
I hurt you back then.

139
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,390
Just because you were part of the Heavenly Tribe, I-

140
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:09,020
All these years,

141
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,970
they told me you had already...

142
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,580
I didn't believe it.

143
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:22,490
Ah Yin, I've been thinking about you and searching for you for so long.

144
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:25,810
I don't believe you don't care for me at all.

145
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:31,350
Who said I'm a part of the Heavenly Tribe?

146
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:34,030
Open your eyes and look clearly.

147
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:36,420
I'm Bai Qian of Green Hill.

148
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,900
You're Bai Qian of Green Hill?!

149
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:46,120
But back then, you-

150
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:51,710
I hid my identity as a nine-tailed fox back then because I wanted to train in Kunlun Void.

151
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:56,510
Since you want to bring up what happened back

152
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:59,320
then, let's talk about it.

153
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,330
You abandoned me and chose Xuan Nü.

154
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,720
You officially married her with four mythical kirin beasts.

155
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,670
The celebration lasted for nine days. Is that true?

156
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,810
Don't bring her up.

157
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:13,800
Weren't you heartbroken back then?

158
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,510
Why didn't you tell me you were from the Fox Tribe?

159
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:22,660
I indeed was sad for a while back then,

160
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,800
but I don't remember it anymore.

161
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,520
Since you're in love with Xuan Nü,

162
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,370
you must love her character and temper.

163
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:35,710
Of course, you wouldn't be in love with her because she looks similar to me.

164
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:39,470
The relationship between us has been severed.

165
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,790
It's the same whether to say it or not.

166
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,790
Ah Yin,

167
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:50,000
I know.

168
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,170
I know you blame me.

169
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:59,850
You hate me for not giving you the Jaded Soul when you were in the Grand Purple Palace back then, but I regretted it.

170
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:03,430
When I went back to Kunlun Void, they said you already...

171
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:08,390
You already left with Mo Yuan's body.

172
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,520
High Immortal.

173
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:21,310
You haven't changed a bit.

174
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:23,950
You still look like a child.

175
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:33,470
Winged Monarch, what happened 70,000 years ago was a mess.

176
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:36,190
You don't have to worry about it too much.

177
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:40,870
Since you have a beauty with you, don't hang onto the past so much.

178
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,190
I'll be taking my leave.

179
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:50,250
Ah Yin. Ah Yin! Ah Yin!

180
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,020
Ah Yin,

181
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,980
you leave like this.

182
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,190
How can I look for you?

183
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,800
How can I find you again?

184
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,920
Mighty Monarch!

185
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,000
Mighty Monarch!

186
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:27,960
Is that female immortal earlier your lover, too?

187
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,540
Leave.

188
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:34,530
Mighty Monarch, I heard everything you two said.

189
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:37,470
She's just a past lover.

190
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:39,140
If it didn't work out, leave it be.

191
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:43,750
If you like female immortals, I'm a female immortal, too.

192
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,190
Female immortal?

193
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,490
Don't tell me you want to enter the Grand Purple Palace?

194
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:01,340
Did you know you immortals will have a short life span if you live in the Winged Realm?

195
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:09,790
Did you also know all the children born from you immortals in the Grand Purple Palace

196
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,690
will die of sickness?

197
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:24,860
Mighty Monarch! Mighty Monarch!

198
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,880
Mighty Monarch.

199
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,870
Mighty Monarch!

200
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,830
Do you really want to enter the Heavenly Palace?

201
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,140
That's all I've ever wished for.

202
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,540
Please grant me this wish.

203
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,790
If you want to, I'll have Tian Shu bring you into the palace.

204
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:22,650
Once you've thought it through, you can leave whenever.

205
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,870
Thank you, Your Mighty Monarch.

206
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,610
Hurry, Father Monarch!

207
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:54,050
Father Monarch, is this the place mother lived for all these thousands of years?

208
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,520
That's right.

209
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,440
Who knew she was so much older than you?

210
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,570
You must really regret not being able to be by her side since you were little.

211
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,760
Your Highness the Crown Prince!

212
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:13,320
Your Highness the Crown Prince, Great Lady isn't here.

213
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,320
I know she's not back yet.

214
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:20,320
Then, do you know where she went?

215
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,890
She escaped from the Eastern Sea.

216
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:25,180
She escaped?

217
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,060
Did she offend someone?

218
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:31,160
That's weird. She finally became a High Goddess after more than 10,000 years.

219
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,300
She shouldn't be afraid of anyone.

220
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,270
Why did she escape?

221
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,570
I have something to take care of. I'll leave Ah Li here.

222
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:44,380
Young Heavenly Grandchild? I don't dare.

223
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,160
How can I take care of him by myself?

224
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,910
I'm easy to take care of. Just give me a cup of tea and two books.

225
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:54,170
Bring me whatever my mother usually likes to read.

226
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:56,600
Young Highness, stop joking.

227
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,420
I came here to Green Hill when I was about your age and have never left.

228
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,260
How would I know what your mother likes to read?

229
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,670
High Goddess Bai Qian is my mother.

230
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:08,730
Whatever she likes to read, I like to read.

231
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,440
What?!

232
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:23,190
When I burned Su Su's clothes, the flames turned into her favorite color: green.

233
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:26,100
If...

234
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:44,300
It's green. It's green.

235
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:01,790
Why aren't you giving up still?

236
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,570
Why is this lamp...

237
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:11,130
I thought you didn't possess any of Su Su's items anymore.

238
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:16,010
It wasn't easy for you to find it. Why did you put it out?

239
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,510
I don't need it anymore.

240
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:20,390
You don't need?

241
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:25,220
I have found her.

242
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:29,100
What do you mean?

243
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:33,890
Did that mortal survive the jump from Immortal Execution Platform? Impossible.

244
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:36,240
Unless the person who jumped wasn't her.

245
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,570
It's neither.

246
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:39,870
You, a taciturn person, hurry and tell me!

247
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:42,250
I feel like I'm suffocating from anxiety.

248
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:52,500
It turns out that the Soul-Gathering Lamp was lit for three hundred years without creating even a shadow

249
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:57,300
because Su Su's soul had not dissipated.

250
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,830
She had just completely forgotten about me.

251
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,600
Her soul didn't dissipate?

252
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,900
How could a mortal not die after jumping off the Immortal Execution Platform?

253
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,250
Unless she's an immortal.

254
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,900
Are you saying she's an immortal?

255
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,670
That's right.

256
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:18,120
Where is she from? I have never seen her in the Heavenly Palace.

257
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:26,150
She's the monarchess of Green Hill, High Goddess Bai Qian.

258
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,280
What did you say?

259
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,540
Don't let anyone know about this for the time being.

260
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,650
There are still two things I can't figure out.

261
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:41,680
Why she initially didn't have a divine aura when she was wandering in the Eastern Wilderness,

262
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,170
and why she has forgotten me now.

263
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,870
Wait! I need some time.

264
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:50,970
I must organize my thoughts.

265
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,610
Where are you going?

266
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:57,190
I'm going to find Emperor Dong Hua.

267
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:01,260
He knows the most about what happened after Qing Cang broke the seal three hundred years ago.

268
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:05,280
I'm going to the Early Dawn Palace. Third Uncle, please put away the Soul-Gathering Lamp for me.

269
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:10,860
Su Su is Bai Qian, and Bai Qian is Su Su.

270
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,220
Wasn't all that past torment for nothing, then?

271
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,610
If we knew it was her, you could've just married.

272
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:18,300
Everyone would have celebrated.

273
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,590
Your Highness the Crown Prince, are you here to see the Emperor?

274
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:41,480
Right. Did he already go down to the mortal world to have his tribulations?

275
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,250
That's right. He already left.

276
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,620
You have always been with him.

277
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:51,890
Do you know what happened 300 years ago when Qing Cang broke the seal?

278
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:54,660
Didn't this matter already conclude?

279
00:21:54,660 --> 00:22:00,230
Great Lady Bai Qian of Green Hill was injured when sealing Qing Cang and fell into a deep sleep.

280
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,120
Is that it?

281
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,550
I don't know about the rest.

282
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:09,320
All right. I understand.

283
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,830
Yun Sheng.

284
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:23,240
Great Lady, it has been many years since you last came here.

285
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,480
This is most unfortunate.

286
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,010
Bi Fang Bird left home again.

287
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,990
Fourth Uncle went out to look for it yesterday.

288
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:35,140
If you don't mind, let me, Yun Sheng, entertain you for now.

289
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,410
This is interesting.

290
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:40,250
Chasing after a bird every day.

291
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,820
I'm used to it.

292
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,030
Great Lady, let's go in now.

293
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,730
Wait.

294
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:52,730
You are acting rather strange.

295
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:57,150
Is my second older brother here?

296
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:03,360
Great Lady, you are really good at predicting things.

297
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,270
Second Uncle has been here since morning. He was angry.

298
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:08,550
Can't you see that we are waiting out here?

299
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,490
We dare not go in.

300
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,330
I'll just go then.

301
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:15,510
- Hey...
- Young Fifth, come in.

302
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,950
Second Older Brother.

303
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,880
Let's go.

304
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:53,710
Great Lady just came.

305
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:55,810
She probably hasn't had breakfast yet.

306
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:59,250
I... am going to prepare her breakfast.

307
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,130
Where is Young Jiu?

308
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,650
She was cooking in my fox den a few days ago.

309
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:15,540
She has done many embarrassing things because of Dong Hua.

310
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:20,870
When she came back 300 years ago, I had to hang her and beat her twice before she behaved.

311
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:25,300
If she's in your den, you better strictly watch her.

312
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:29,510
Second Older Brother, don't worry. I will tie her up in the fox's den in Green Hill for sure.

313
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,420
I won't let her do anything embarrassing again.

314
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,340
Fine.

315
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,180
The debt of Emperor Dong Hua saving her life...

316
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,490
Second Older Brother, please don't worry.

317
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:41,210
Green Hill will bear the favor that Young Jiu owes Emperor Dong Hua.

318
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:42,960
As her aunt, I will repay him.

319
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:49,170
I surely won't let that evil root, which took great pains to be cleanly cut off, to bud again.

320
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:52,460
Emperor Dong Hua is an immortal that came from a rock.

321
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:56,470
He can't be loved and you mustn't put him in your heart, for he will never warm up.

322
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:59,070
Okay.

323
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:04,930
Why did you suddenly come to the Northern Wilderness?

324
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:10,120
It's the first-month celebration for Water Monarch's son.

325
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,810
He sent the invitation to Green Hill.

326
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:15,190
Father and Mother went traveling for leisure.

327
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:18,380
I was alone and bored; hence, I came to take a look.

328
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,010
The Eastern Sea is in the east.

329
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:23,960
If you wanted to go back to Green Hill, you should have gone through the Eastern Wilderness.

330
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:27,350
If you hadn't told me, I would have forgotten.

331
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:31,320
Fourth Older Brother asked me to get two jars of peach blossoms wine from Zhe Yan.

332
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,110
I came to deliver it here.

333
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:36,290
Waste of time.

334
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:38,910
I'll deliver them to the kitchen, then.

335
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,440
All right.

336
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:00,700
Great Lady, are you not going to have breakfast?

337
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:10,290
I'm leaving. These are the peach blossoms wine that Fourth Older Brother wanted.

338
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:15,420
By the way, Great Lady, I just overheard that you went to the banquet in the Eastern Sea.

339
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:18,240
- Yes, I did go.
- I heard His Highness the Crown Prince went, too.

340
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,300
Did you see His Highness the Crown Prince?

341
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,370
I saw him.

342
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:26,100
That year, when he came to the Northern Wilderness to suppress the rebels,

343
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,860
I had the honor of delivering the map of the Northern Wilderness to His Highness the Crown Prince.

344
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:33,290
His Highness the Crown Prince's charms and good looks were unforgettable to me.

345
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:37,540
You were just a little immortal 300 years ago.

346
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,390
How could you remember it that clearly?

347
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:44,000
I won't hide this from you, but I love hearing others talk about His Highness the Crown Prince.

348
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,900
Great Lady, you should know, in all the wars within these 30,000 years,

349
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:51,660
as long as His Highness the Crown Prince took action, he was undefeatable.

350
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,200
If one day you marry His Highness,

351
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,350
you must remember to bring me along.

352
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,030
I'm leaving now.

353
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:02,820
Carefully serve that person in there.

354
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,540
Young Highness, slow down.

355
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,280
Young Highness.

356
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,490
Mother!

357
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:16,420
Mother you lied!

358
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:21,100
Yesterday, you said you were going back to the Heavenly Palace with us.

359
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:24,600
I should die. You told me to guard Green Hill

360
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,140
but when His Highness the Crown Prince came, I couldn't stop him.

361
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,960
Please punish me for my mistake.

362
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,080
Monarch Ye Hua came, too?

363
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,270
Father Monarch said you don't want to go back with us

364
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:40,000
because you can't get used to the Heavenly Palace. That's fine.

365
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,520
Father Monarch and I can move here to live with you instead.

366
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:48,340
I don't care where I live as long as I'm with you, Mother.

367
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,730
You want to move in with me?

368
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:53,600
Your father monarch wants to, too?

369
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,000
Great Lady, don't rush.

370
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,670
There's a precedent.

371
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:01,240
- Precedent?
- I heard when Heavenly Monarch became the crown prince,

372
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,360
the former Heavenly Monarch bestowed our older cousin to him as the crown prince consort,

373
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:09,400
but Heavenly Monarch wasn't happy, so the former Heavenly Monarch punished him by confining him at Aunt's place.

374
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,230
After one month, they developed affection for each other.

375
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:15,500
They then returned to the Heavenly Palace, and that became a story passed on for generations.

376
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,150
Story passed on for generations?

377
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:23,170
That's right. Monarch Ye Hua coming here to live in Green Hill is perfectly justifiable.

378
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:25,500
No one can refute that he can't go.

379
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:34,120
I feel like he's coming here to bring me trouble.

380
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:37,870
Did you provoke him in the Eastern Sea?

381
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:42,000
I interfered in his marriage with the princess of the Eastern Sea.

382
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,460
My goodness.

383
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:48,370
Well... he's not here yet.

384
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:50,400
You can hide for a while.

385
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:55,160
- He's not here?
- Yes, he left as soon as he brought Young Highness here.

386
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,520
Mother, I'm hungry.

387
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,800
- Do you have food?
- No.

388
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,150
What about Young Jiu?

389
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:06,570
Doesn't she cook?

390
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:10,800
She left for the Mortal Realm to repay her debt right after you left.

391
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,980
She went to repay her debt again?

392
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:17,080
Don't tell me it's Emperor Dong Hua?

393
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,610
This is bad.

394
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:21,810
Let's buy Ah Li some food from Mushroom Market first.

395
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:23,820
Let's go.

396
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,850
Noble Lady! Noble Lady!

397
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:43,660
Noble Lady, His Majesty is here.

398
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,980
Your Majesty, that is Noble Lady Chen who almost died after falling into the pond.

399
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,930
She now has almost recovered.

400
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,730
- Noble Lady Chen?
- Yes.

401
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:10,300
You've never really summoned her before.

402
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,290
It's pitiful that she was sick. I'll choose her for tonight.

403
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:21,120
Yes.

404
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:44,210
Noble Lady, be prepared to attend to His Majesty tonight.

405
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:47,520
- Attend to him tonight?
- Congratulations, Noble Lady.

406
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:02,290
Did he... Did he say I will attend to His Majesty tonight?

407
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:06,900
Yes, Your Highness. His Majesty finally chose you to attend to him.

408
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:21,750
When I was an immortal, I always thought about repaying my debt.

409
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:24,610
But I didn't know how to repay this debt.

410
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,810
Now that I'm in the Mortal Realm, I'm going to spend the night with him.

411
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:31,000
What a surprise.

412
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:37,450
That night, I was scared and waited for the eunuch to pick me up.

413
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:41,600
I didn't imagine that after waiting...

414
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,670
Greetings, Consort De and Consort Xian.

415
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:05,800
I heard after Noble Lady Chen recovered,

416
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,400
she grew a phoenix flower mark on her forehead.

417
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:15,220
I want this flower to be judged by the priest.

418
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:31,390
Daoist Priest, are you saying the flower on my forehead is a demonic flower?

419
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:35,460
Yes. This is a demonic flower.

420
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:43,240
Guards, lock Noble Lady Chen in her room.

421
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:49,690
She's not allowed to leave this Lotus Courtyard without my orders.

422
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:12,010
Is it a demonic flower?

423
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:13,740
Forget it then.

424
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:18,140
Are you not going to order to have her removed from the palace?

425
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:23,250
I don't believe in the priest's words.

426
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:25,040
I just think it's a pain.

427
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,560
I just won't summon her again. Now leave.

428
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,230
Yes.

429
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,480
She got off easy.

430
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:53,020
That fraud priest.

431
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:56,390
He said my flower, which is the mark of a goddess, is a demonic flower?

432
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:58,750
Stupid.

433
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:03,160
I've been locked in here for seven days.

434
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:07,290
Don't tell me I'll never be able to see Emperor again in this life.

435
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:16,990
I should go into the Emperor's dream and ask him what his wish in this life is.

436
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:21,050
This way, I can give him exactly what he wants to repay his debt.

437
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,310
I apologize, Emperor.

438
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:11,740
I really just want to repay my debt this time.

439
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:16,230
I hope you can tell me what you wish for.

440
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:20,530
I'll do my best to help you.

441
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:46,000
What do you wish for in this lifetime?

442
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,610
Who's speaking?

443
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:58,670
I'm an immortal from the Nine Heavens.

444
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:04,450
I'm talking to you through your dream to ask you why you have such an expression on your face.

445
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:08,140
Do you have any unfulfilled wishes?

446
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,990
Wish?

447
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:14,470
I don't want land nor riches.

448
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:17,490
I just want someone's heart.

449
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:21,140
Can you give someone like that to me, Immortal?

450
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:37,510
Can you not do something so easy even though you're an immortal?

451
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:43,090
Is that true?

452
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:47,670
All you want is someone who wholeheartedly loves you?

453
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,190
As the emperor of a nation, naturally, I won't lie.

454
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:58,180
Okay, then I'll promise you.

455
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:48,620
Emperor... Isn't he an immortal birthed from a rock?

456
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:51,340
Why is he now yearning for love?

457
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:01,290
Did you personally make this?

458
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:04,560
She did many embarrassing things because of Dong Hua.

459
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,310
When she came back 300 years ago,

460
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:09,100
I had to hang her and beat her twice before she behaved.

461
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:12,560
If she's in your den, you better strictly watch her.

462
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,730
One day in Heaven is a year in the Mortal Realm.

463
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:19,250
Young Jiu'll be back in two months at most.

464
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:22,200
Second Older Brother probably wouldn't realize.

465
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,010
Young Jiu o' Young Jiu, please come back soon.

466
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:28,900
Otherwise, even I can't protect you.

467
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,880
Great Lady.

468
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,590
Great Lady, you're back. Where is Her Highness Fengjiu?

469
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:36,550
She's usually the one to pick fruits for you.

470
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:38,710
She'll be back soon.

471
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,170
Great Lady!

472
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,110
My mother is so young and beautiful.

473
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:55,040
Why do you call her as if she's old?

474
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,410
When did you have a child, Great Lady?

475
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:00,690
Yesterday.

476
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:02,840
So you're Great Lady's young highness.

477
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,810
In Mushroom Market, there are many nice foods and toys.

478
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:10,100
Do you like it, Young Highness?

479
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,840
Mother, I want this.

480
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,670
Take one.

481
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,330
Great Lady.

482
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:41,940
There was a big harvest so why do you look so down?

483
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,840
It's because of the big harvest that I'm upset.

484
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,320
A big harvest means I have to sell it cheaper.

485
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,140
Although the harvest last year was few, you earned a lot.

486
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,520
This looks good.

487
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:57,130
You learned how to pick fruit from Young Jiu,

488
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:59,210
so you pick.

489
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,090
Then, let's get half a basket of this.

490
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,790
Monarch Ye Hua, you're here.

491
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:18,310
Good timing. We're eating loquat for lunch.

492
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:20,380
Do you want to join us?

493
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:24,710
Ah Li's still growing but you're giving him this?

494
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:27,570
- Do you like it?
- Yes!

495
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:32,150
Where can we find some meat and vegetables?

496
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:35,290
- Do you still want the loquat?
- Yes!

497
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:44,120
Take a look at this one.

498
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:48,740
- So handsome.
- Right.

499
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:51,690
That child calls our Great Lady his mother.

500
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:55,190
Yeah, he also calls that man Father Monarch.

501
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,970
Great Lady! Great Lady, you're back!

502
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:01,330
These two fish are gifts of respect for you.

503
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:03,920
Stew them and eat them as nourishment for your body.

504
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,660
Thank you. She takes care of her son alone so she does need nourishment.

505
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:18,530
Go and make some food.

506
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:25,970
Great Lady, you clearly know... you clearly know I don't know how to cook.

507
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:28,060
There's a first for everything.

508
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:30,150
You were even able to endure a heavenly lightning tribulation.

509
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:32,020
I'm optimistic that you can do it.

510
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:35,090
Mother, I'm hungry.

511
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:37,210
Great Lady, please spare me.

512
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:39,820
I'm a tree sprite. I hate fire.

513
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:41,500
I know.

514
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:44,970
But I'm not telling you to use yourself as firewood.

515
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:46,820
Ah Li is hungry.

516
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,640
I—

517
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:05,710
I don't understand you.

518
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:09,630
Green Hill is a place for immortals but you've made it resemble the Mortal Realm.

519
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:11,260
Men till the land and women weave clothes.

520
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:13,880
There's not even a hint of divine powers.

521
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:19,710
It's not interesting if we use divine powers to solve everything.

522
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:22,330
They'll get bored, too.

523
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:30,940
I'm thinking about making a battlefield someday and have them fight each other to prevent them from getting too bored.

524
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:33,960
That seems interesting.

525
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:37,850
I'll bring some Heavenly Soldiers to add to the fun.

526
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:11,770
”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

527
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:13,830
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

528
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:16,450
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

529
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:21,780
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

530
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:30,890
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

531
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:35,100
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

532
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:40,390
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

533
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:45,980
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

534
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:52,430
♫ All are just illusions ♫

535
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:59,420
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

536
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:04,610
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

537
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:09,000
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

538
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:15,290
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

539
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:20,560
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

540
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:25,950
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

541
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:28,730
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

542
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:38,360
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from my previous life ♫

543
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:49,900
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

544
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:55,380
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

545
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:59,770
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

546
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:06,060
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

547
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:11,220
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

548
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:16,560
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

549
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,320
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

550
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:28,460
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

551
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:40,500
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
