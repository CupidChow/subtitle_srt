”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

2
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,550
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,070
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:24,650
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:28,250
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,450
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:35,250
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,840
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,300
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,920
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,490
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:52,990
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:56,430
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,030
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,440
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,100
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,610
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:14,050
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,980
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,820
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,310
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:24,800
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,050
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,880
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,570
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:38,830
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:42,100
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,700
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

[Eternal Love]

30
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,930
[Episode 16]

31
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,230
Eldest Brother.

32
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:49,180
Did Li Jing send you to kill me?

33
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:55,990
Eldest Brother, I'm here to get you out of here.

34
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,430
Are you awake, Mighty Monarch?

35
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,820
Xuan Nü.

36
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,530
It is I.

37
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:35,040
Where exactly have you been for those 70,000 years?

38
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,490
Ah Yin again? It's been 70,000 years!

39
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:41,160
Why are you still thinking about that girl from the Heavenly Tribe?

40
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,900
She's from the Heavenly Tribe, so what?

41
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:49,530
All my 3,000 concubines are inferior to her.

42
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,790
What has Ah Yin ever done for you?

43
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,290
She only uses you.

44
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:02,190
Even after Mo Yuan's death, she used your love for her to get the Jaded Soul!

45
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,850
Mighty Monarch!

46
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,750
Aren't you supposed to be in the Land of Extreme Coldness?

47
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,920
Royal Princess took the traitor Li Yuan!

48
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,240
What did you say?!

49
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,250
Her Highness had the commanding seal. I didn't dare stop her, so I came to report back!

50
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,500
Why does Yan Zhi have my commanding seal?

51
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,910
I clearly put it in—

52
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,930
Did you take my commanding seal?

53
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,990
She came to me and asked for it.

54
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,690
How dare you give away something that important?!

55
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,890
Do you know Li Yuan was taken?!

56
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:04,570
I thought she wouldn't do anything to hurt you because you dote on her so much!

57
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:08,690
Li Yuan's mother is from the Merpeople Tribe, so he definitely would flee to the Long Sea.

58
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:12,520
If the Merpeople Tribe rises in rebellion, I will hold you solely responsible if the Winged Realm goes into chaos!

59
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,120
Guards!

60
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,270
- Mighty Monarch.
- Go quickly and tell all the generals

61
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:20,720
that Li Yuan, the traitor, has been rescued by the princess and should be on his way to Long Sea.

62
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,910
- Hurry and capture him back for me.
- Yes.

63
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,380
Wait!

64
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,040
Don't make this matter public, especially to the Nine Heavens.

65
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,050
Carry this out in secrecy.

66
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,590
Yes!

67
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:03,360
Do you not worry about my old age?

68
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,440
It's not appropriate to ride clouds here, so I ran all the way here!

69
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,020
What about Su Jin?

70
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,160
She went to serve tea to the chieftains.

71
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,020
She won't be back for a while.

72
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,520
Just hurry up.

73
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,000
Guards!

74
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,020
Present.

75
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,820
No one is allowed to enter without my permission.

76
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,410
Yes!

77
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,320
Your Highness!

78
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:54,220
I want to see His Highness the Crown Prince.

79
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,390
Mighty Monarch ordered that no one is allowed to enter.

80
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,670
Your Highness the Crown Prince, I, Su Jin, beg for an audience.

81
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:20,350
I ask to meet with Your Highness the Crown Prince.

82
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,780
This Su Jin is really something.

83
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,250
Isn't she supposed to go serve tea?

84
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,550
Why is she here all of a sudden?

85
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,760
What should I do?

86
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:33,740
If he doesn't respond quickly, she might get suspicious.

87
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:38,180
If she tells Heavenly Monarch, we're done for!

88
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,230
Your Highness!

89
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,360
His Highness usually does not rest this early.

90
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,390
Is he feeling unwell?

91
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,520
Does he need to be checked?

92
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,550
Please go back. When His Highness the Crown Prince does not wish to see anyone,

93
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,200
only the Heavenly Monarch can make him come out.

94
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,670
Don't you think it's weird?

95
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:09,630
Even if His Highness the Crown Prince doesn't want to see me, he would at least respond.

96
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:13,420
His Highness might not... might not have heard you.

97
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,150
Please look, Your Highness.

98
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,250
His Highness even blew out his candle.

99
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,570
He's telling us he's resting now.

100
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,620
Your Highness knows him the best.

101
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:38,950
If he's not in the mood to talk, he won't say a single word for a whole day.

102
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:42,760
Now, he even blew out the candle.

103
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,090
He might be telling you to leave.

104
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,290
Keep an eye on him.

105
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,950
Do not be negligent.

106
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,520
Yes!

107
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,450
This is not the way to solve the problem.

108
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:20,650
Ye Hua is the Crown Prince of Heavenly Tribe but he locks himself in his room every day.

109
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:23,300
People will notice sooner or later.

110
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,930
Su Su!

111
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,820
Where did she go?

112
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,990
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

113
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,610
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

114
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:05,000
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

115
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:14,250
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

116
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,240
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

117
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,650
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

118
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:29,380
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

119
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:36,100
♫ All are just illusions ♫

120
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:42,870
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

121
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:48,210
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

122
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,350
Ye Hua...

123
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:57,900
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

124
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,600
I'm back.

125
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,680
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

126
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:11,700
Do you know that you have gone for half a year without saying a word to me?

127
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:16,430
Did anything happen to you that threatened your life?

128
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,230
No.

129
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,820
No?

130
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:30,790
Do you know that you had left for such a long time and you can brush it off with a "no?"

131
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,410
I had to take care of something urgent.

132
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:39,540
What kind of thing was that urgent that you couldn't tell me before you left?

133
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm sorry.

134
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:54,970
Do you know that everything about you is good except that you never tell me everything?

135
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:57,820
It's hard for me to understand you.

136
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,420
Never mind how much I've told you, you just need to trust me.

137
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,660
All right.

138
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,620
I lost.

139
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,930
You don't have to say anything if you don't want to.

140
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:27,290
But if you keep taking things upon yourself, that makes me feel like I'm not your wife.

141
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,380
Look! You're not saying anything again.

142
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:40,530
You introvert, I'm no longer angry with you.

143
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:43,100
Can't you just say something sweet to me?

144
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,440
It's all my fault.

145
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:56,830
You... You disappeared for over six months.

146
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:59,680
You can only say that you're sorry.

147
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,800
In this world, nobody else acts like you do.

148
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,860
- Were you injured?
- No.

149
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,830
In this world, not many people can harm me.

150
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,870
- You liar.
- Why?

151
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:25,600
Didn't you lie in front of my house covered in blood on the day we first met?

152
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:29,850
That day was an exception.

153
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,620
Su Su.

154
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,230
I need to go.

155
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:01,130
Ye Hua!

156
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:04,000
You have to leave again?

157
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,370
How long this time?

158
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:11,990
A year... or two.

159
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:14,060
A year or two?

160
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,940
Do you know how long that is?

161
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,650
I'm sorry.

162
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:32,220
I married you because I hoped you could always be by my side.

163
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:42,520
Who'd know after half a year of good days, we would have to separate for such a long time?

164
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:49,750
It's fine.

165
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:53,830
It's just two cycles of seasons.

166
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,360
I can wait.

167
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,600
Go ahead.

168
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:05,360
Let me give you something.

169
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,480
Take this copper mirror.

170
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:26,620
If you talk to this, I can hear you no matter where I am.

171
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:30,400
I can respond if I'm not busy.

172
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,470
Ye Hua.

173
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:45,320
Before you came here, I lived on this mountain all by myself and I didn't think much of it.

174
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:50,200
But we're married now.

175
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:55,720
Please stop making me wait for you.

176
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:01,520
I'll get mad if you take too long.

177
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:18,610
I'm really afraid... that if I find you lying in front of the hut covered in blood again one day, what should I do?

178
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,500
Su Su,

179
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:26,860
if I had nothing, would you still be with me?

180
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:38,090
Except for that sword at the corner of the wall, you never had anything to begin with.

181
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:42,600
And I only use that sword to chop wood.

182
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:48,790
It's not that useful for me, yet I accept you for who you are. Do I not?

183
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,670
It is true.

184
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:53,000
You never rejected me.

185
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:02,010
Close your eyes.

186
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:12,160
Wait for me to return.

187
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:21,400
Ye Hua?

188
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,840
Ye Hua!

189
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,250
Ye Hua!

190
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,440
Ye Hua?

191
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:00,930
That was fast.

192
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:06,930
You have several hours' worth of time in such a long night to spend quite a few months with her in the mortal realm.

193
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:10,100
Why did you come back as soon as I sent Su Jin away?

194
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,290
This is Heavenly Tribe's branch territory.

195
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:16,980
They'll overthink if they realize that I disappeared by using magic.

196
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,200
That's true, too.

197
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,850
Then get some rest.

198
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:25,230
We need to head back tomorrow after meeting their chieftain.

199
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:48,230
Have you decided?

200
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,440
Are you going to fake your death?

201
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,010
I've thought about it for the whole night.

202
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:56,040
I compared all possible methods.

203
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,970
Faking my death may be the most dangerous method,

204
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,030
but it's the most effective one.

205
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:03,160
If I want to stay with Su Su,

206
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:08,390
I have to fool this group of pedantic old gods here in Heaven that my soul has dissipated.

207
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:15,880
This is the only way to protect her life and to have a good ending with her.

208
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,610
If you want to deceive the Heavenly Monarch, it's going to be very hard.

209
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:24,070
Hence, I must fake my death in front of everyone.

210
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:27,010
I can't give the Heavenly Monarch any doubt.

211
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:32,220
There is a good chance right in front of me now.

212
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,150
- What's that?
- The Merpeople Tribe.

213
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,480
Do you want to use the battle with the Merpeople Tribe to fake your death?

214
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,940
This is the perfect opportunity for me to escape.

215
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,170
Have you made a conclusive decision?

216
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,990
Ye Hua, you're not a normal person.

217
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,030
You're Heavenly Tribe's crown prince.

218
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:55,820
For you to fake your death means you're giving up the whole world!

219
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:59,760
I'm a crown prince but I'm also her husband.

220
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:05,140
If Ye Hua disappears from the Heanvely Tribe, another person can be the crown prince.

221
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:10,280
If I still do nothing now, people will eventually discover her existence.

222
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:14,460
At that time, Heavenly Monarch won't let her off.

223
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:19,070
Looks like this isn't just a casual affair for you.

224
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:21,510
You're being serious.

225
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:27,420
Between the crown prince position and her life, I only want her.

226
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,200
But to do my duty as the crown prince,

227
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,610
I will surely convince them to send out an army in pacifying the Merpeople Tribe.

228
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:44,700
This is my final contribution for the Heavenly Monarch and the Heavenly Tribe as the crown prince.

229
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,970
Chieftains, we haven't seen each other in more than 70,000 years.

230
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:03,380
How are you, Your Third Highness?

231
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,970
I'm doing very well. I'm doing very well.

232
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,680
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

233
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:15,590
We didn't expect the Crown Prince to personally accompany little Su Jin to the memorial ceremony

234
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:18,120
and come to visit us bunch of old soldiers.

235
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,820
I'm really surprised!

236
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,170
Dear Chieftains, you are all my elders.

237
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:25,330
This is not the Heavenly Palace, so we don't need the formalities.

238
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:29,680
The Heaven Monarch sent me here also to get acquainted with you.

239
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,810
I'm not the Crown Prince today.

240
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:35,360
I will respectfully call you "senior uncles" instead.

241
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,470
Your Highness, just be frank with us.

242
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,390
It's about the Merpeople Tribe, right?

243
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:47,510
I heard that the Merpeople Tribe, the branch of the Winged Tribe, is stirring again.

244
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,900
What? Are they planning for a rebellion?

245
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:54,210
Right. I won't beat around the bush with you all.

246
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:56,260
This way, please. Let's go back first before talking.

247
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,210
I'll entertain you all with good food and drinks.

248
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:01,180
Good! We'll go back and have the meat and drinks you're offering.

249
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:04,490
We'll listen to Your Highness the Crown Prince talk about those rebels!

250
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,290
- Please.
- Please.

251
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,390
I've always heard that Your Highness the Crown Prince looked a bit like the God of War, High God Mo Yuan.

252
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:33,090
Seeing you today, it is indeed true!

253
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:37,220
When I saw Your Highness, it's as if High God Mo Yuan came back!

254
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,280
Hey, you can't say it that way.

255
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,160
His Highness progressed to the High God rank at just 20,000 years old.

256
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:46,230
That was never before seen in our Heavenly Tribe.

257
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:51,770
Indeed! High God Mo Yuan only became a High God by the age of 25,000 years.

258
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:55,730
Your Highness, you are a level above him!

259
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,340
Right, right. I was being muddled-minded! I'm muddled!

260
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:02,990
It must be because Your Highness looks so alike Mo Yuan,

261
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:07,000
that you were naturally born with an exceptional body.

262
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:15,460
For you Senior Uncles to mistake me as High God Mo Yuan clearly shows the weight of High God Mo Yuan in your hearts.

263
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,730
I have achieved no war merits yet.

264
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:21,750
I'm really embarrassed to accept the praises you have for me.

265
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:30,560
Your Highness was able to tug on the pain in my heart with just a few words.

266
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,600
High God Mo Yuan. I really miss him a lot.

267
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:42,230
That's right. I can never forget the graceful bearing of High God.

268
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:47,910
In the past, you all accompanied High God Mo Yuan to pacify wars.

269
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:51,330
All of you are chieftains with outstanding military contributions.

270
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:53,330
But now that the world is in peace,

271
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:56,560
High God Mo Yuan has also returned to a formless mass.

272
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:01,570
May I ask if you all still have the drive to guard this world?

273
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:13,870
To be honest, it may look like that I came this time to ask you all to send out your army to fight the Merpeople.

274
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:20,850
But in reality, it's to strengthen the friendship between the Heavenly Tribe and all you branch chieftains.

275
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,350
Your Highness might be joking with us.

276
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:31,900
Although we are subtribes, we are still members of the Heavenly Tribe. Right?

277
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,340
The friendship is still there. Right?

278
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,590
That's right. It's still around.

279
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:42,560
Even if the friendship is still present, hearts have grown distant.

280
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:57,650
All of you are my elders.

281
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:00,790
Please forgive me for being frank.

282
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:06,830
After the Great Battle in the Four Seas, Emperor Dong Hua abdicated his throne

283
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:09,230
and passed it on to the current Heavenly Monarch.

284
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:13,550
Because of this, you all have some veiled criticisms,

285
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:18,250
leading to the current conflicts between the main branch and its sub-branches.

286
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,220
Am I right?

287
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,830
That happened very long ago. Your Highness is exaggerating.

288
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:31,000
Old people like us don't remember those things of the past.

289
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,550
Right. We don't remember anymore.

290
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:36,620
Senior Uncle, what you said is right.

291
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:41,870
I also am willing to believe that all these are in the past.

292
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,800
Your Highness, don't worry.

293
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,090
We all are always of one heart with the Nine Heavens.

294
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:49,180
When the Heavenly Tribe had that great war with the Winged Tribe back then,

295
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,980
we all willingly led our men and charged ahead.

296
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:55,780
Su Jin's Tribe even willingly sacrificed their whole tribe just to be the bait.

297
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:59,500
Your Highness, you surely have heard of it. Right?

298
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,480
I did.

299
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:05,650
Not only did I hear it, I've remembered it in my heart.

300
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:21,940
In that great war 70,000 years ago,

301
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:25,260
although our Heavenly Tribe obtained victory in the end,

302
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:28,320
we also paid a very painful price.

303
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:35,470
Not only the Sujin Tribe, but your tribe also lost 2,000 men.

304
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:40,680
And more than half of your elite young men have died.

305
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:49,160
For you, even the women in your tribe also joined the battle.

306
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,170
A total of 1,760 died.

307
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:59,250
I know all about the sacrifices of these comrades.

308
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:13,360
In here, I want to offer a toast to everyone and also a toast to those heroes that have died.

309
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,710
Thank you, Your Highness!

310
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:24,590
I also want to ask everyone one more question.

311
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:30,660
70,000 years ago, why did Mo Yuan sacrifice his soul?

312
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,870
Do you all remember?

313
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,810
For the sake of our world, of course.

314
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:40,430
That's right. It's for our world.

315
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:44,200
High God Mo Yuan was Father God's son and the God of War,

316
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,650
but he was willing to sacrifice his life to seal the Donghuang Bell.

317
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:50,760
He did it for the numerous lives on this land.

318
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:58,020
Now, I want the Merpeople Tribe to surrender for the same reason, the people of the Four Seas.

319
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:07,170
I sincerely request that you let go of your animosity and give me your troops.

320
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:12,620
I will defeat the Merpeople Tribe and return our world to peace.

321
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:26,850
Seeing Your Highness today, you are indeed a capable and wise man.

322
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:29,420
You truly uphold your reputation.

323
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:34,720
But ever since the war against Qing Cang, my tribe has been discouraged.

324
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:16,450
What His Highness just said made me remember my father and tribesmen.

325
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:22,880
Everyone, I ask that you not forget,

326
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:32,060
my father and my whole tribe were willing to die to protect the Heavenly Tribe and the world 70,000 years ago.

327
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:41,910
I ask you to let bygones be bygones and fight alongside His Highness to protect our world.

328
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:45,680
It will allow my father to rest in peace.

329
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:57,540
All right! I'll trust you, Your Highness.

330
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,930
That's right. That's right.

331
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:03,160
We're good men. Why should we hesitate because of the past?

332
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:06,080
- If there's something we want to do, then do it.
- That's right!

333
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,730
Our troops can be deployed anytime. We await your command.

334
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:11,520
Good.

335
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,020
I thank you all for your trust.

336
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,520
The Merpeople Tribe has been causing trouble in Long Sea for thousands of years.

337
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,940
I will pacify the armed rebellions within half a month.

338
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:26,050
I'll toast to you.

339
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:29,560
During the battle, I will be at the front line.

340
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:43,310
We pledge our lives to follow Your Highness.

341
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:03,020
Your Highness, why is the Merpeople Tribe causing trouble at Long Sea?

342
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:06,060
Do you know the reason why?

343
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:11,950
I heard that the admiral of the Long Sea navy is not a good leader and has a weak personality,

344
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:14,710
so it has lead the Merpeople Tribe to strengthen; causing disaster.

345
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:18,560
That's right. It's because of Water Monarch's indulgence.

346
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:23,590
That why Your Highness must find a good assistant before we go.

347
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:27,680
- An assistant?
- For the past thousands of years, the Water Monarch of Long Sea

348
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:30,800
would often ask His Second Highness of the West Sea Water Monarch for help.

349
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,930
Back in the days, His Second Highness was High God Mo Yuan's disciple.

350
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:35,860
Ever since Kunlun Void was abandoned,

351
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:41,230
he left Kunlun Void, is wandering the lands and searching for his teacher and seventeenth junior brother.

352
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:44,310
Whenever Long Sea was in a state of emergency, he would lead troops to help.

353
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:47,710
He has fought with the Merpeople Tribe multiple times.

354
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:49,170
Mo Yuan's disciple?

355
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:52,070
Mo Yuan's eldest disciple, Die Feng.

356
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:54,120
Die Feng?

357
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,790
I've heard my father mention him before. I got it.

358
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:02,060
Recently, I've heard that Water Monarch of Long Sea wants to marry off his daughter

359
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:05,020
to the leader of the Merpeople Tribe to preserve peace.

360
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:09,990
If you want to start a war, the Water Monarch would be an obstacle.

361
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:13,830
I'm afraid if we lead troops there, the Water Monarch might speak up for the Merpeople Tribe.

362
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,950
I'm afraid if we lead troops there, the Water Monarch might speak up for the Merpeople Tribe.

363
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:19,240
Then we'll look really bad.

364
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:24,470
Before we start the war, I will go meet the Water Monarch of Long Sea.

365
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:26,520
I have said all that I needed to say.

366
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,270
I won't disturb you anymore.

367
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:30,970
I will take my leave.

368
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,690
Su Su.

369
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,260
Are you there?

370
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:51,850
I thought the copper mirror was broken.

371
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:54,140
It wasn't a convenient time to talk earlier.

372
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,040
It's nothing much.

373
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:02,850
I just wanted to ask you what you want to eat when you return. I'll prepare it for you.

374
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:05,190
Su Su.

375
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,960
What?

376
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,520
You should stay put.

377
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,370
Are you angry?

378
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:24,800
No. I'm playing with my bird.

379
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,100
I don't feel like bickering with you.

380
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:33,020
I wish you'd bicker with me more.

381
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:35,260
Why?

382
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:40,100
If you bicker with me more, then you'll talk to me more.

383
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:50,740
Ye Hua, I thought about something today.

384
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:53,190
I want to discuss it with you.

385
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:55,070
What is it?

386
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,660
I'm thinking...

387
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:08,530
If... If we have a child who could keep me company,

388
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:11,890
I wouldn't be afraid if you left me all the time.

389
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:15,140
But I'm afraid you might not like children,

390
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:18,770
so I want to discuss this with you.

391
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:30,640
It's okay if you don't like children. Really!

392
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:35,320
Without children, it's more peaceful and quiet.

393
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,860
Do you want a boy or a girl?

394
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:40,060
What?

395
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:44,140
Tell me in person when I get back.

396
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,460
Heavenly Monarch.

397
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,810
You may leave for now.

398
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:12,750
Yes.

399
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:29,830
I asked you to come here because I wanted to ask you what happened when you traveled back with Heavenly Consort.

400
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,930
How was it?

401
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:38,090
After meeting with those chieftains, what are your thoughts on the situation with the Merpeople Tribe?

402
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:41,020
I would like to ask your permission to go to the Long Sea.

403
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,280
You want to go to the Long Sea?

404
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,040
Yes. I want to go to the Long Sea.

405
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,320
First, I want to meet the Water Monarch of Long Sea

406
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:55,080
to see if he's as rumors say, backing down to the Merpeople Tribe and giving them his land.

407
00:35:55,080 --> 00:36:00,730
Second, I want to keep watch of the Merpeople Tribe's every move from the Long Sea

408
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:05,520
in order to find an opportunity to start a war against them.

409
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:09,970
We have to resolve this situation with the Merpeople Tribe sooner or later.

410
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:15,170
But isn't it too early to start a war now?

411
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:18,650
I think it's better to do it sooner rather than later.

412
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:23,690
Our catching them off guard is the key for us to win.

413
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:34,100
All right. I will allow you to go to the Long Sea.

414
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,050
Yes.

415
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,610
As the crown prince of the Heavenly Tribe,

416
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:46,880
going to your own land to see the local conditions and customs shouldn't raise any suspicions.

417
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,970
But Ye Hua, the Merpeople Tribe have been a danger to the Long Sea for the past 70,000 years.

418
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:54,840
It's called a danger because it's a perennial problem.

419
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,600
So you can't rush things.

420
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,440
I think so, too.

421
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,590
So going there this time, I don't want to go as the Crown Prince.

422
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:06,070
You want to go undercover?

423
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:08,230
Like what you said,

424
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:14,050
Long Sea is our territory and the Merpeople Tribe is a problem for us.

425
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:17,150
I'm going there this time to find an opportunity

426
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:20,220
to break the ties between the Long Sea's Water Monarch and the Merpeople Tribe.

427
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:25,130
If we have the Water Monarch's request for our troops, then we can send our troops openly and properly.

428
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:26,790
That's right.

429
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:29,050
You've thought about things meticulously.

430
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:32,230
I haven't interfered with the Merpeople Tribe situation

431
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:34,390
because I was afraid that the other Water Monarchs would get suspicious

432
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:37,060
and think that our tribe is using the Merpeople Tribe as an excuse

433
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:41,440
to take away their authority, starting with the Long Sea.

434
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,690
I understand.

435
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:48,740
All right. We'll do as you say.

436
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:51,890
Yes.

437
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,500
Emperor?

438
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,120
Have you seen Si Ming?

439
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,420
No.

440
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,940
What are you eating?

441
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,820
- Fruits.
- Who gave them to you?

442
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:50,520
Exactly who gave them to you?

443
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:57,700
I think it was Cheng Yu.

444
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,810
You dare eat the food that she has given you?

445
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:22,930
I can't finish all of these fruits.

446
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:24,880
Emperor, have one.

447
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:29,800
Judging from the way you are acting, you probably don't even know what I'm saying.

448
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:42,680
Emperor, honestly...

449
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:46,170
I like you.

450
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:49,120
I like you so much.

451
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:55,680
Even if you didn't tell me, I already knew.

452
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:04,850
I... I heard the view at Early Dawn Palace is especially amazing.

453
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:08,540
But I've been living in Early Dawn Palace all this time.

454
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:11,280
How come I never realized that?

455
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,580
When you are free, you can ask Si Ming to show you around.

456
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:19,600
You don't need to waste your time on worthless activities with me, an old man.

457
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:23,790
You're not old.

458
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:29,020
When I was the Ruler of the Heavens and Earth,

459
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:32,160
your grandfather wasn't even married yet.

460
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:47,260
So you dislike it that I'm younger than you?

461
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:52,830
All right. Just sit here, and don't mess around.

462
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:55,980
I'll go find two divine maids to send you home.

463
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:03,580
No. If I go back, Crown Prince's cousin will scold me again.

464
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:07,250
- Does she scold you often?
- Yes.

465
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:23,970
Let's go. It's none of our business now.

466
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:26,210
Why?

467
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:29,130
You write mortal stories every day.

468
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:31,560
You don't even understand this?

469
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:35,000
Her Young Highness is in a daze right now.

470
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,040
Everything she says right now is the truth.

471
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,820
It will make others fall for her charms.

472
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:46,470
I'm sure there will be some sparks between her and that old emperor.

473
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:51,780
Oh! This is the trick you used to win over His Third Highness in the past.

474
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:54,250
Am I right? Am I right?

475
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:56,660
Don't talk to me about that playboy.

476
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,600
I won't. I won't.

”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

479
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,550
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

480
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:40,150
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

481
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:45,610
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

482
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:54,690
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

483
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,870
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

484
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:04,280
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

485
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:11,500
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

486
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:16,710
♫ All are just illusions ♫

487
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:23,220
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

488
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:28,360
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

489
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:32,720
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

490
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:38,820
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

491
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:44,510
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

492
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:49,630
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

493
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:52,560
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

494
00:43:52,560 --> 00:44:01,570
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from my previous life ♫

495
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:13,590
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

496
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:19,120
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

497
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:23,460
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

498
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:29,790
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

499
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:34,940
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

500
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:40,410
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

501
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:43,170
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

502
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:52,140
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

503
00:44:53,790 --> 00:45:05,120
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
