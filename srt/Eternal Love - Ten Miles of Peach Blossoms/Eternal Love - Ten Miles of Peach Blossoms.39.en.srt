”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,570
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,970
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,620
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,260
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,420
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,270
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,840
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,350
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,900
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,450
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,970
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:56,430
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,020
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,660
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,120
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,670
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:14,170
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,000
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,780
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,230
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:24,770
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:28,120
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,810
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,560
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,880
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,150
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,560
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

29
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:05,020
[Eternal Love]

30
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,910
[Episode 39]

31
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,080
And you?

32
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,840
When my affection for you was the strongest, you gave me a big blow.

33
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,980
You only know that I let go quickly and confidently,

34
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,880
but you don't know that behind it, I went through so much heartache.

35
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,730
That year, when Teacher died,

36
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,910
I forcefully brought a humble heart

37
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,390
and went to your Grand Purple Palace to borrow the Jaded Soul.

38
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:47,260
You will never understand how much courage I mustered.

39
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:53,830
And you won't ever understand how much you had disappointed me.

40
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,360
It wasn't like that.

41
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,370
I didn't know how seriously injured you were then.

42
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:04,860
If you have told me that you used the blood from your heart to preserve Mo Yuan's body,

43
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,260
I would have given it to you.

44
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:13,380
I didn't give you the Jaded Soul because I knew you were protecting Mo Yuan.

45
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:17,030
Yes, I was jealous.

46
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,050
I was jealous of Mo Yuan.

47
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,090
But Ah Yin,

48
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:26,010
the truth is... is that I've never forgotten you.

49
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,760
Can you forgive me?

50
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,630
Winged Monarch, you are telling me now that you have never forgotten me?

51
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:50,340
It's because you are constantly pursuing something you can't have or something you have lost.

52
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:56,990
But once you get it, you won't treasure it anymore.

53
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:04,750
Are you just saying this to lessen your own burden?

54
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:11,270
You never actually loved me, right?

55
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,080
After the incident with Xuan Nü and me,

56
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,980
you let go so quickly

57
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,160
because you were already disgusted with me. Right?

58
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:31,160
But everyone makes mistakes.

59
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,170
You're my only love.

60
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,200
Why can't you forgive me?

61
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:44,200
You did such a thing back then.

62
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,880
Do you wish for Xuan Nü and me to share the same husband?

63
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:57,450
When I left Grand Purple Palace, I was definitely angry and hated you.

64
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:02,020
But after losing so much blood in Splendid Flame Cave and I was hanging on for life,

65
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,670
I discovered that the face in my head wasn't you at all.

66
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:09,750
I knew then...

67
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,890
that I was not heartbroken,

68
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,620
that I was finally free.

69
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,830
Ah Yin! Don't say that.

70
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:25,980
Li Jing, you are indeed

71
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:30,130
the only man that I loved in these 140,000 years,

72
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,290
but time changes everything.

73
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,120
We can't go back to how we used to be.

74
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:42,140
I understood too late.

75
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,890
And you...

76
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,580
won't remain in the same spot to wait for me.

77
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:56,860
Let's be strangers from now on.

78
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,190
Goodbye.

79
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,550
They were such sweet words,

80
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:42,030
but the way you say it sounds so hurtful.

81
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,060
Look at the sky.

82
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,350
It might rain soon.

83
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,960
Let's go.

84
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,790
- High God, are you looking for Great Lady?
- Yes.

85
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,080
Didn't she just come back last night?

86
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,490
- Where did she go again?
- She went to Heavenly Palace.

87
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:29,090
His Highness the Crown Prince said that Lord of Lingbao has a Heavenly Spring Pool in High Clear Plane.

88
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:32,860
Soaking in it will help to heal Great Lady's injury, so he brought her to Nine Heavens.

89
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,770
Where's Zhen Zhen then?

90
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,590
Fourth Uncle went to the market.

91
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:40,890
He said that he wanted to personally choose some ingredients to cook for you.

92
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,790
He's not Fengjiu. His cooking is terrible.

93
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,960
He's torturing me.

94
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:50,200
By the way, I'm here for another important matter.

95
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,720
A few days ago, when Young Fifth brought Mo Yuan back, did she leave him in Splendid Flame Cave?

96
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,300
Yes, High God Mo Yuan is still there.

97
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,290
But Great Lady didn't leave him there.

98
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:02,020
When she came back, she was seriously injured and unconscious.

99
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:05,800
His Highness the Crown Prince personally brought High God Mo Yuan back.

100
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,750
While Zhen Zhen is not back yet, take me to see Mo Yuan.

101
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,440
Okay. High God, please come with me.

102
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,640
I will go in alone. You can go back first.

103
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,320
Yes.

104
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,650
For the time being, don't let anyone know that I came to visit Mo Yuan.

105
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,090
Yes, High God.

106
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:09,820
Zhe Yan! Come drink with me.

107
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:11,990
What wine?

108
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:14,310
It definitely can't be better than mine.

109
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:17,100
Looks like you wasted money again.

110
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,820
This is the best wine in Green Hill.

111
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,090
Just make do.

112
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:27,170
Even if I want to, I fear that I can't do it today.

113
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,300
I need to rush back to Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms forest.

114
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,100
Going back there?

115
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,660
Didn't you say that you were going to stay in the fox den for a few days?

116
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:39,340
I thought of a way that could save the eldest prince of the Western Sea,

117
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:43,680
but I need to rush back to the Peach Forest to flip through my medical books.

118
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,620
Really?

119
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,850
Go back now.

120
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,670
Go now and come back soon.

121
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,410
It's indeed as I expected.

122
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:08,500
This Kunlun Void is a divine mountain that grew from a dragon bone.

123
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,140
When Mo Yuan left, it became deserted.

124
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:17,010
But now, there's a faint dragon energy moving below it.

125
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:20,060
This place is indeed abnormal.

126
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:30,040
High God Zhe Yan.

127
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,030
You are...?

128
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:35,040
Second Disciple of Kunlun Void.

129
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:42,380
I met you before when Si Yin first met her teacher.

130
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:46,180
Yes, it was during that time that I had the honor to meet you.

131
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,210
Just now, when I was feeding Teacher's divine cranes,

132
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:51,800
I heard them calling and I knew that an important guest was here.

133
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,780
I didn't expect that it would be you, High God.

134
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,770
High God, I wonder why you are here.

135
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:01,260
What can I do for you?

136
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,890
When Father God passed away,

137
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:07,560
I once eternally sealed the divine weapon Zither of Fuxi under the Kunlun Mountain.

138
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,280
In the blink of an eye, many years have passed.

139
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,920
I suddenly miss this old partner, so I came to take a look.

140
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,430
I see.

141
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,870
I had heard Teacher mention this magical weapon before.

142
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:20,660
High God, this way, please.

143
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:31,580
You are the only disciple left in Kunlun Void?

144
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:37,750
These past 70,000 years, some disciples return home if they have family affairs,

145
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:41,620
and those that don't, go and look for Teacher and Seventeenth's whereabouts.

146
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:45,100
A few days ago, Zi Lan came back and cleaned up this place.

147
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:49,170
Then, Winged Monarch came, saying he saw Si Yin.

148
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:52,250
Zi Lan was so excited and said he would go to the Mortal Realm to find him

149
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,310
and asked me to take care of the cranes.

150
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:58,900
Oh? The Winged Monarch said he saw Si Yin?

151
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:03,040
I don't know if he was telling the truth,

152
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,750
but Zi Lan couldn't sit still and went to find him.

153
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:31,010
Even Green Hill's entrance has Mi Gu watching at least.

154
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:34,090
This Eternal Heavenly Realm of yours made of 36 heavens...

155
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,910
There's not even a single guard here.

156
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,900
Doesn't look imposing at all.

157
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:42,320
Today, Old Monarch Taishang is having a public Dao lecture.

158
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,760
I reckon they went to the assembly.

159
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,740
So, there's a religious assembly.

160
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,760
Qian Qian, I heard that when you were in the mortal realm to help Yuan Zhen with his tribulation,

161
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,100
you often discussed Daoism with Yuan Zhen.

162
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,790
I'm sure you now have a deep knowledge of Dao.

163
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:08,950
For tens of thousands of years, Old Monarch Taishang can be considered as unrivaled in speeches.

164
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:11,140
He's at the very top,

165
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,350
and you can say that he's been very lonely.

166
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,410
Now that you are here, you can debate with him.

167
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,770
Well said. Well said.

168
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:35,210
[Pure Wutong Palace]

169
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:37,980
I hear when you were 30,000 years old, you set up the office for military affairs,

170
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,460
and Heavenly Monarch named this Pure Wutong Palace.

171
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,000
That's right.

172
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,630
But this place is so dim.

173
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:52,290
It looks like the Crystal Palace of the Eastern Sea during that 100-day old celebration.

174
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,700
It's because you can't look at glaring light.

175
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,910
Because of me?

176
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,130
Qian Qian.

177
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,860
I'll take you inside.

178
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:32,970
I didn't imagine that we would need to jump in when we would come to Nine Heavens

179
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:35,250
and not be able to even take the main gate.

180
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:42,210
If we walked through the main gate, we would surely alarm all the courtyards here.

181
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:44,890
It would be annoyingly noisy.

182
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,820
It's more convenient to jump over the wall.

183
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,030
That's reasonable.

184
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:58,010
By the way, we came early today.

185
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:02,110
It's still not the time for that Little Immortal Jia Yun to deliver you your official documents.

186
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:06,200
Did you not tell him to stop sending documents to Green Hill

187
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,590
and are causing him to go there in vain?

188
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,870
What you just said makes sense.

189
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:20,750
Fortunately, we didn't use the main door and alert the little immortals.

190
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,910
If not, it would be troublesome.

191
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:31,380
But talking about this, we went home late yesterday,

192
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,880
so many documents have accumulated.

193
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,930
How's your review of them?

194
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:47,530
Usually, this Crown Prince acts even more serious and calm than the solemn Dong Hua,

195
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:52,480
but today, he showed expressions that can only be seen in a young lad.

196
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,920
It's really difficult.

197
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,440
I have something to discuss with you.

198
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,300
Qian Qian, why are you suddenly so serious?

199
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,390
I wonder what it is.

200
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,600
It's not something serious.

201
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:15,280
I will recuperate in Nine Heavens for a few days.

202
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:20,190
Since I came here quietly and didn't use my High Goddess status,

203
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:23,850
I can't let you openly set up a bedchamber for me.

204
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:29,030
Why don't I stay at Mochi's Qingyun Hall and make do for a few days?

205
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,580
You want to live in Ah Li's Qingyun Hall?

206
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:36,170
Is it not convenient?

207
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,800
I...

208
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,680
I have set up a bedchamber for you.

209
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:58,670
By the way, about my teacher...

210
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,730
No one will find out.

211
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,410
You have peach blossoms in your courtyard, too.

212
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:29,400
Did you move them from the Peach Garden?

213
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,730
I planted these 300 years ago.

214
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:34,910
They finally blossomed after all these years.

215
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:39,060
They blossomed for the first time after 300 years?

216
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,390
You have patience.

217
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:57,240
[Courtyard of Moonlight]

218
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:01,070
"Courtyard of Moonlight?"

219
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,100
It's a good name.

220
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,720
It fits your Pure Wutong Palace.

221
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,460
Since I stepped into this courtyard,

222
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,980
I've been feeling off and uncomfortable. Why?

223
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,670
High Goddess, please have some tea.

224
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,220
Okay.

225
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,340
My Lady?

226
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,750
My Lady, it's indeed you!

227
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,620
I've waited for you for 300 years.

228
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,100
You're finally back.

229
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,930
Your Highness the Crown Prince, the Soul-Gathering Lamp is truly a sacred relic.

230
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:43,340
The creation is identical.

231
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:49,710
Young Immortal, you must have recognized the wrong person.

232
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,790
I'm Bai Qian from Green Hill.

233
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:54,330
I'm not who you're speaking of.

234
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:03,770
Nai Nai, this is the High Goddess of Green Hill, Bai Qian.

235
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:06,070
She'll be living here for a while.

236
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:08,450
Please take care of her.

237
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,430
Get up.

238
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:24,720
She will be going to Lord of Lingbao's Heavenly Spring afterward.

239
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,130
Make the preparations first.

240
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:29,090
Yes.

241
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,550
Go rest up.

242
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,230
I'll bring Ah Li here.

243
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:41,060
Sure.

244
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,830
What?!

245
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:56,520
High Goddess Bai Qian is here?

246
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,040
Yes, Your Highness.

247
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,790
She just entered from the southern gates.

248
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:02,300
She's now in Courtyard of Moonlight.

249
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,310
What did you say?

250
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,040
Courtyard of Moonlight?

251
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:13,250
His Mighty Monarch has never allowed anyone near there!

252
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,380
That's right, Your Highness.

253
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:19,040
I find it strange, too.

254
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:26,400
By right, for 300 years, His Mighty Monarch has always protected the place that mortal lived in.

255
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:30,300
Why did he suddenly allow another woman to live there now?

256
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:40,080
Xin Nu, I think this Bai Qian

257
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,650
is harder to deal with than we thought.

258
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:47,410
Your Highness, why do you say this?

259
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:50,650
His Mighty Monarch repeatedly broke the taboos for her,

260
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:53,400
it's just like he has lost his heart.

261
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:59,290
In the past, I comforted myself and said that it was okay,

262
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:04,370
that at least his beloved person is dead.

263
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:08,450
But now...

264
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:17,350
Xin Nu, you will help me. Right?

265
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:21,980
No matter what, you will help me to win back Ye Hua's heart. Isn't that so?

266
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,090
Your Highness, don't worry.

267
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:32,480
I will always be your right-hand person.

268
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,890
I will definitely help you.

269
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:37,960
Your Highness, don't be afraid.

270
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,290
She just arrived at Nine Heavens.

271
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:42,170
She's not familiar with the place.

272
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:46,760
After all, we have been in Heavenly Palace for ten thousands of years.

273
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,950
That's right.

274
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,890
I shouldn't panic.

275
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:55,790
I'm the legitimate side consort of Pure Wutong Palace.

276
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,890
I must not panic.

277
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,870
I should be calm, and wait and see

278
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:06,140
how I can drive her off.

279
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:20,370
Has your crown prince always liked peach blossoms?

280
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,550
My Lady liked peach blossoms very much.

281
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:29,810
His Highness the Crown Prince planted all this after she passed away.

282
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:33,670
Are you talking about Ah Li's mother?

283
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,990
Have you heard about her?

284
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:42,210
Ah Li told me when we first met.

285
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:45,590
My Lady passed away after giving birth to His Young Highness.

286
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:49,880
I raised him since he was young.

287
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:52,590
Mother!

288
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,080
You're here.

289
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,980
Nai Nai, what's wrong?

290
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,750
It's nothing.

291
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,340
My hands slipped. Please forgive me.

292
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,950
Mochi's mother is dead,

293
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,680
and she can no longer enjoy the pleasure of having children running around her.

294
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,180
I, as the stepmother, instead got it easy.

295
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,420
This maid probably can't endure watching it.

296
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,610
What a loyal maid.

297
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:17,370
Mother, hug me!

298
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:22,360
I'm not feeling well.

299
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,750
Have your father hug you.

300
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:27,600
I know now.

301
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,480
You're pregnant again, right?

302
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,290
That is what's written in the books.

303
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:38,030
It said that when a married woman is pregnant,

304
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:42,990
her family doesn't allow her to carry other children for fun.

305
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:48,940
They are afraid that it will... That's right, put her at risk of a miscarriage.

306
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:53,140
You're a little doll that's only as tall as a garlic shoot.

307
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,920
How do you even know about miscarriages?

308
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,530
Ah Li, who's letting you read these books?

309
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:01,660
Cheng Yu lent me the books.

310
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,500
Cheng Yu again?

311
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,030
Cheng Yu is a skillful person.

312
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,290
Even if you are pregnant,

313
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:12,010
Young Highness, why are you blushing, too?

314
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:14,130
I'm happy!

315
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:15,700
If you have a baby,

316
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:20,320
I won't be the youngest in Heaven again.

317
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:29,420
Qian Qian, why don't we have a child immediately after the wedding?

318
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:36,640
I'd be willing to help if you were the one giving birth.

319
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:42,560
Since Ah Li is here, why don't we go together to High Clear Plane?

320
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,860
Let's go.

321
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,680
Greetings, Your Highness the Crown Prince.

322
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,990
Ye Hua, if I come here with the title as your main consort,

323
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:08,770
how many maids would lead the way?

324
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:11,730
Ten. What's wrong?

325
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:14,290
I think my grade didn't rise.

326
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:16,420
I don't think this was a good bargain.

327
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,350
If we become the Heavenly Monarch and Heavenly Monarchess,

328
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,750
there will be 24 maids to lead the way for you,

329
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:24,370
and four capable ones to rub your back.

330
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:26,810
This sounds good.

331
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:34,930
Greetings, Your Highness the Crown Prince.

332
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:38,900
There's even wine?

333
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,630
These are fruit wines.

334
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,800
If Ah Li wants to drink it, let him have some.

335
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,310
But don't let him drink too much.

336
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,790
You can let him have some of these fruits and vegetables, too.

337
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:50,250
But he can only eat half of each.

338
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:55,290
It's not easy for you to act as both his father and mother.

339
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:58,500
It has been many years and I'm used to it.

340
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:05,800
The peach blossoms on the fan were drawn very well,

341
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,730
but it's lacking some poems.

342
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:10,160
Why don't you soak first?

343
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:13,220
I'll inscribe a poem for you. Look for me in the study later.

344
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,330
Okay.

345
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,750
Mother, why did Father Monarch leave?

346
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,890
He's not going to soak with us?

347
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:33,330
Heaven gave your Father Monarch huge responsibilities.

348
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:36,770
Your Father Monarch has gone to undertake an important task.

349
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,730
When you were a mortal, you liked peach blossoms.

350
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:02,790
I didn't expect that as a high goddess, your preferences hadn't changed.

351
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,780
Qian Qian,

352
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:10,030
I might be just lying to myself and you might be hiding yourself,

353
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:15,480
but although our relationship is shorter than your relationship to Mo Yuan,

354
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,190
you are the only woman I have ever loved in my life.

355
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:21,620
I will wait for you.

356
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:26,030
Wait for you to forget Mo Yuan and truly fall in love with me.

357
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,760
Older Sister, are you looking for me?

358
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,750
His Mighty Monarch finally returned to Purple Morning Hall today.

359
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,060
If you don't make use of this opportunity,

360
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,680
don't blame me for not helping you.

361
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:07,420
Older Sister, I don't quite understand what you mean.

362
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:21,790
This is a nourishing soup for His Mighty Monarch.

363
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:24,260
It's rare for him to return to Pure Wutong Palace.

364
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:26,620
Your mind must be more active.

365
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:29,640
You must show up tonight and attend to him.

366
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:50,920
What if His Mighty Monarch gets angry?

367
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,730
You don't understand this man.

368
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:04,740
If he has any sexual relations with you, he will take responsibility.

369
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:08,350
Also, you don't need to fear that he would get angry.

370
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:11,860
Firstly, you are Ah Li's savior,

371
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:14,530
so he won't kill you.

372
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:16,510
Secondly, you have me.

373
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:18,470
I will protect you.

374
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:22,200
After all, I'm the only person you can rely on in Pure Wutong Palace.

375
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,760
As for me, other than you, I don't have any younger or older sisters.

376
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:40,060
Thank you, Older Sister.

377
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:52,930
High Goddess, please drink this.

378
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:56,580
It was plum wine just now. What is this?

379
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,810
High Goddess, this is loquat fruit wine.

380
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:03,390
Loquat fruit?

381
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:06,630
When I was in Green Hill, Ah Li and I loved to eat loquat fruits.

382
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:10,940
That's right. My mother loved to feed me loquat fruits.

383
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:20,690
He's drunk?

384
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:24,090
His body is so hot. Looks like he's not pretending.

385
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:26,740
He can't hold his liquor.

386
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:29,190
This is His Young Highness's first time drinking this much

387
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:31,160
and he's this drunk.

388
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,620
I should take him to Medicine King to have a look.

389
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,270
No need.

390
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:38,190
I have been drinking for several thousands of years.

391
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:39,970
I can be considered an expert.

392
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:44,000
The wine that he just drank was fermented from divine fruits.

393
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,950
He won't get drunk no matter how much he drinks.

394
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:50,260
I'm still afraid that there may be a mishap.

395
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:54,060
He's a boy. There's no need to spoil him.

396
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,830
Listen to me. Take him back and let him sleep for a bit.

397
00:30:56,830 --> 00:31:00,320
He'll wake up after 6 hours.

398
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,100
Yes.

399
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,550
High Goddess, please drink this.

400
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:22,260
This maidservant is very loyal to her old mistress.

401
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:25,660
Her mistress passed away about two to three hundred years ago, right?

402
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:30,610
High Goddess, I'm not very clear about Pure Wutong Palace's matters.

403
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:34,570
Don't you know about the matters in the Crown Prince's palace?

404
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:38,200
I only know there was a pile of incidents at Pure Wutong Palace.

405
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:43,120
The divine maids and guards from then were demoted to the lower realms.

406
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,350
Looks like Heavenly Monarch thought of all bases in order to cover up this matter.

407
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:47,770
He even replaced the divine maids.

408
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:52,190
No wonder when I was in Green Hill, I only heard that Ye Hua only favored Su Jin and had no other consorts.

409
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:56,390
Of course, it was reasonable for me to assume that his only son was birthed by Su Jin.

410
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:59,050
This is my first time here in Heavenly Palace.

411
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,430
I'm not used to the way here.

412
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:05,310
Please show me the way to the Crown Prince's study.

413
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:08,100
High Goddess, please come with me.

414
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,590
Your Mighty Monarch.

415
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,610
What is it?

416
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,920
I have been waiting for Your Mighty Monarch for a long time.

417
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,370
It wasn't easy to wait till Your Mighty Monarch was back.

418
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:41,560
I wonder if Your Mighty Monarch could let me say a few words.

419
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,950
Because I saved His Young Highness,

420
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:54,530
you let me serve you for a few days.

421
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:57,330
This is my blessing.

422
00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:03,480
But then, I requested that Your Mighty Monarch allowed me to come to Pure Wutong Palace to be your servant

423
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,650
in the hope that I could obtain your favors.

424
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:09,120
This is my fault.

425
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:14,100
I have decided to leave and go back to the Eastern Sea today.

426
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:20,820
Treat this bowl of soup as the last thing I will do for Your Mighty Monarch.

427
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:27,810
I wonder if you could drink this and consider this as an end to our fate.

428
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:32,340
I do not have any fate with you.

429
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,550
But since you saved Ah Li

430
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:37,760
and you are my servant,

431
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,560
I will drink this soup as a way to conclude our relationship.

432
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:50,760
There's no need.

433
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,610
Do you really want me to drink this?

434
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,580
I personally made this soup,

435
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:20,280
so, of course, I hope you can drink it.

436
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,250
This is my kind intention, too.

437
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:31,200
Why, Your Mighty Monarch?

438
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,130
I want to ask you a few questions first.

439
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,880
What would you like to ask?

440
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:43,330
A few days ago, you went back to the Eastern Sea.

441
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:50,850
I visited home because I missed my brother.

442
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:53,960
Did you know that when you visited your brother,

443
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,030
Emperor Dong Hua was going through his tribulation in the mortal realm?

444
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,220
I didn't know.

445
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:05,810
On that day, someone pushed Emperor Dong Hua.

446
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:11,190
At the same time, High Goddess Bai Qian was pushed down, too.

447
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:14,410
At that time, I sealed her powers

448
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:17,590
and she almost drowned to death.

449
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:20,460
Is that so? That's a close call.

450
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,660
It was a close call.

451
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:28,700
Do you know High Goddess Bai Qian's position and status among the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses?

452
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:33,990
Green Hill and the Heavenly Tribe won't forgive whoever pushed her.

453
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,720
Miao Qing!

454
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:43,740
Are you really not afraid the Eastern Sea and your brother will be punished for this?

455
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:49,000
Are you really not afraid that by plotting to kill a high goddess, you will be reincarnated as an animal?!

456
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,480
I made a mistake!

457
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,860
Please spare me!

458
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:57,480
If you weren't Ah Li's savior,

459
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,510
you wouldn't be alive today.

460
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:02,050
I was wrong. Please spare me!

461
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:04,570
Please spare me, Your Mighty Monarch!

462
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,410
Then tell me.

463
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:09,720
What's in the soup?

464
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:17,300
This soup... After you drink this soup,

465
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,220
it will make you have sex with me.

466
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,200
So powerful.

467
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,620
Who gave it to you?

468
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:28,490
I... I bought this from the Mortal Realm.

469
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:33,250
Mortal Realm? Do you really think medicine from the Mortal Realm works on me?!

470
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:35,380
I just...

471
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,180
Your Mighty Monarch!

472
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:46,190
Your Mighty Monarch, I heard the palace maids saying that you were blaming Younger Sister Miao Qing.

473
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:48,820
I don't know what she did wrong,

474
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:51,890
but I'm sure it's not out of spite.

475
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:55,140
It could be the result of cherishing you too much.

476
00:36:55,140 --> 00:37:02,000
I hope you can forgive her on the basis that she saved Ah Li before.

477
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:30,630
Why aren't there any guards here?

478
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:50,890
I can't be that lucky to bump into teasing between lovers again, right?

479
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:55,410
Ye Hua is usually calm and indifferent, but also hot-blooded.

480
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:57,850
The divine maids here are also not bad.

481
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:59,990
He reviews those uninteresting official documents in the night.

482
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:01,410
He must be very bored.

483
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:06,140
When he looks up and sees a beautiful divine maid on the side,

484
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,970
naturally, he would want to be intimate.

485
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:09,640
I should avoid this.

486
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:13,470
Qian Qian, what're you doing pacing back and forth out there?

487
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:15,050
I have already written the poem on the fan.

488
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:16,880
Come in to get it.

489
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:23,550
Darn. Well, let's see what kinds of beauties you're into.

490
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:32,480
Here.

491
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:38,510
What kind of act is this?

492
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,950
She has beautiful eyes.

493
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:51,480
It's a shame. Although she is pretty, she's not good enough for those eyes.

494
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:55,180
You have nice eyes.

495
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,150
Su Su.

496
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:18,230
Princess Miao Qing.

497
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:22,190
I don't have space for you in my Pure Wutong Palace.

498
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:25,120
Please go back to the Eastern Sea tomorrow morning.

499
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,820
As long as you don't step out of line again,

500
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:31,420
I will forgive your past.

501
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:35,160
Take it as repayment for saving Ah Li.

502
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:44,760
Su Jin, you do treasure friendship.

503
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,330
If you really can't bear for Princess Miao Qing to leave,

504
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:51,600
why not ask Heavenly Monarch to put out a decree and let you marry into the Eastern Sea?

505
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,370
What do you think?

506
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:56,710
Your Mighty Monarch, I temporarily lost my sanity,

507
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:59,980
so I used this aphrodisiac soup to try to seduce you.

508
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:04,190
Your Mighty Monarch, I won't object to whatever punishment you give me.

509
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:07,680
Even if I have to suffer 49 heavenly lightning strikes every day,

510
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,800
I don't care!

511
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:13,340
I beg of you, don't kick me out.

512
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:20,690
My only wish in my life is to stay with you and serve you forever.

513
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:24,100
Your Highness! Your Highness!

514
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:27,720
I have wronged you in the past, and you helped me once.

515
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:31,210
Please help me again.

516
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,100
Your Highness.

517
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:39,620
Since Princes Miao Qing is begging me,

518
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:44,060
I can't bring myself to beg you back.

519
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:46,450
I should say something.

520
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:48,220
Go ahead.

521
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:53,800
In this situation, Princess Miao Qing's not the only one at fault.

522
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:59,490
You did know at that time that she liked you yet you brought her here to Heaven.

523
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:05,310
I know you wanted to repay the debt for Ah Li by helping her avoid her marriage

524
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:08,240
and send her back once she'd thought it through,

525
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,790
but that's not what she had in mind.

526
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:14,500
She must've thought you liked her, too.

527
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:17,250
You gave her this thought,

528
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:20,380
and you pretended to be a gentleman by not taking action.

529
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:24,020
She would naturally be forced to make the first move.

530
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:29,960
But back then, she said she was fine with being a maidservant at Pure Wutong Palace.

531
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:35,860
Do you believe what a woman says when she's in love with you?

532
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:43,070
Just listen to me.

533
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:45,690
You should return to the Eastern Sea immediately.

534
00:41:57,270 --> 00:42:00,800
She is my wife

535
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,210
and the only consort in this Pure Wutong Palace.

536
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,040
Since she has spoken,

537
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,640
Princess Miao Qing, please go back to the Eastern Sea.

538
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,330
Your Mighty Monarch.

539
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:18,610
Your Mighty Monarch. Your Mighty Monarch!

540
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:54,910
”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

541
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:57,100
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

542
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:59,650
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

543
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:04,920
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

544
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:14,200
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

545
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:18,370
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

546
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:23,590
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

547
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:29,650
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

548
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:35,800
♫ All are just illusions ♫

549
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:42,610
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

550
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:47,810
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

551
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:52,290
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

552
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:58,480
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

553
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:03,880
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

554
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:09,060
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

555
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:11,900
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

556
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:21,610
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from
my previous life ♫

557
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:33,040
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

558
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:38,610
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

559
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:42,970
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

560
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:49,120
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

561
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:54,410
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

562
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:59,830
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

563
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:02,560
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

564
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:11,840
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

565
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:23,860
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
