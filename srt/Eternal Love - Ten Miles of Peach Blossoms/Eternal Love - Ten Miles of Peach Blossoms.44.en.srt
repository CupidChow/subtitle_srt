”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,510
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:21,040
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,640
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,120
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,370
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:35,190
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,740
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,350
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,890
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,420
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:53,030
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,440
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,030
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,510
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,040
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,500
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,230
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,990
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,740
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,280
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,810
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,030
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,780
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,550
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:38,930
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:42,060
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,990
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

[Eternal Love]

30
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,990
[Episode 44]

31
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:24,040
- You are dismissed.
- Yes.

32
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,470
Fourth Older Brother?

33
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,720
Are you here to have a drink with Eldest Senior Brother?

34
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,280
Although I enjoy drinking with your eldest senior brother,

35
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,880
this time, I'm here especially to visit my younger sister.

36
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,970
Thank you for your concern.

37
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,050
I just wanted to come take a look at you.

38
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:00,420
But now that I do see you...

39
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,750
Although your injuries are healed,

40
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:06,610
why do you look so sick? You seem drained and pale.

41
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:10,470
Are you not pleased that Mo Yuan is about to return?

42
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,210
I'm happy about it.

43
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,410
Why would I not be happy?

44
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:18,540
Then, why do you look so distracted?

45
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:24,140
Perhaps it's because I used a spell earlier and haven't recovered my strength yet.

46
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,930
All right, I'll tell you.

47
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:39,320
It's because of Mochi.

48
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,190
I got angry at Ye Hua over a trivial matter.

49
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:46,960
Recently, Mochi had two sips of fruit wine with me.

50
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,810
Who knew that he would be so bad at drinking?

51
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,840
He got drunk and slept for 14 to 16 hours.

52
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,500
I didn't think that it was a serious matter.

53
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,540
But Ye Hua got really angry at me when he found out.

54
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:02,260
He said I didn't take care of Mochi as I would for my own son.

55
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,850
I was too angry and said a couple of mean words in a fit of rage.

56
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:10,960
I told him to have his side consort look after his son, and not me.

57
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:15,110
Ah Li is just a child, but you fed him so much wine.

58
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,370
He got drunk and slept for 14 to 16 hours.

59
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,610
You didn't even send anyone to inform Ye Hua.

60
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:22,880
Then, as the stepmother, you left without a word about where you were going.

61
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,640
If he wasn't angry at all, then he'd really be quite something.

62
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:34,160
Judging by your personality, you usually brush it off as a joke.

63
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,970
But this time, you've lost your poise and even brought up his side consort to provoke him.

64
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:45,140
You're not acting like yourself. Could it be that you are jealous?

65
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,350
Impossible.

66
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,570
But... these two days in the Nine Heavens,

67
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,420
I did lose my poise a bit.

68
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,990
I felt so uneasy seeing that side consort, Su Jin.

69
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,890
And I couldn't stand it when Ye Hua scolded me.

70
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:12,500
Could it be that I really am jealous, and have been for so long?

71
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,510
You are jealous.

72
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,640
No way.

73
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:23,170
I'm 90,000 years older than him.

74
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:27,410
If I'd married young, my grandson would be about his age.

75
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:34,120
I even thought about getting him a few beautiful side consorts.

76
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:38,970
Fourth Older Brother, if I really have feelings for him,

77
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:44,130
when he confessed his feelings for me, shouldn't I have been moved and felt something?

78
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:48,920
What? He confessed to you? Great.

79
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:53,710
If he's fallen for the sister I've brought up, then he's got great taste.

80
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,300
As for the age difference...

81
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,370
Our father is 15,000 years older than our mother.

82
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:03,080
As long as you look good together, then it's fine.

83
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:07,290
You two look great together.

84
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,520
Speaking of side consorts,

85
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,430
Zhe Yan once wanted to find me a wife,

86
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,930
but it hasn't worked out even after looking for a long time.

87
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:21,460
He probably feels that there is no female immortal good enough for me.

88
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:28,860
You've always been slow-witted when it comes to romance.

89
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,050
Let me ask you. If he were to leave,

90
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,510
would you feel strange?

91
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,600
When Ye Hua first came to Green Hill,

92
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,060
I wasn't used to having him around.

93
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:55,240
But I thought that since we'll have to live together after we're married,

94
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,740
I let him do what he wanted.

95
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,840
During the day, he'd drag me out for a stroll.

96
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,100
When he was going through reports, I'd munch on melon seeds.

97
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,840
We'd play a game or two of Go at night.

98
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,610
I thought that once we're married, we'd have to live like this together for all of eternity anyway,

99
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:16,120
so I got used to it.

100
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:19,890
But after that question you just asked me,

101
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:26,130
I started wondering how I spent my days in Green Hill before Ye Hua came.

102
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,920
It really seems that you have fallen for Ye Hua.

103
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,320
But you don't have to be so perplexed.

104
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,720
Since Ye Hua has made a vow,

105
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,700
if he breaks it in the future...

106
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,330
Judging by this situation, I can set my mind at ease.

107
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,320
I'll get going.

108
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,080
Fourth Older Brother, what is your mind at ease about?

109
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,820
What if he really breaks his vow?

110
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,170
Then, what will I do?

111
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,570
If I really have fallen for Ye Hua,

112
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:02,010
then haven't I wasted 140,000 years of my life?

113
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:09,050
I actually fell for a chap that's 90,000 years younger than I am, who should address me as his ancestor.

114
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,240
Emperor.

115
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:37,520
We originally decided on 60 years of tribulations.

116
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,060
Why did I return so soon?

117
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,710
Did you change my plans without permission?

118
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:45,090
I wouldn't dare do that.

119
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,420
This situation is indeed bizarre.

120
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:50,840
In the Book of Fate, there were originally many things written.

121
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,560
But the words suddenly vanished.

122
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,780
Perhaps, since you're different from other immortals,

123
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,850
you took the tribulation differently.

124
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:05,340
Is your health okay, since you returned to the Heavenly Palace so abruptly?

125
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:11,590
I have lost ninety percent of my power.

126
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,420
What?

127
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:19,230
Maybe this is because the tribulation in the Mortal Realm was incomplete,

128
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,850
so I'm being penalized.

129
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:24,450
Perhaps, I will be fine after several years.

130
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,800
Keep this information quiet.

131
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,090
Don't tell anyone.

132
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,390
Yes.

133
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,710
Young Highness, since you have repaid your debt of kindness,

134
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:52,730
you won't have any relationship with Emperor Dong Hua again.

135
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,390
Have some porridge now.

136
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:58,190
Look at how much weight you've lost in the Mortal Realm.

137
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,080
Mi Gu, tell me.

138
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:07,370
Did I cause the emperor to die from anger in the Mortal Realm?

139
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:12,430
Is this considered as payment of my debt, or do I owe him again?

140
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:15,370
Young Highness, if you really want to think of it that way,

141
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:18,070
it's not very clear.

142
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:23,080
If I can't clear up this debt, I can't give it up.

143
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,810
I will say something you might not like hearing.

144
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:37,820
Even if this debt is cleared, will you really be able to give up Emperor Dong Hua?

145
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:45,650
Mi Gu, that's the exact question in my heart.

146
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,570
Tell me.

147
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:51,610
Is my relationship with him really just that of debtor and creditor?

148
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:03,580
Then, what do the many years that we spent together in the Mortal Realm... count as?

149
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:07,670
I used to watch plays in the Mortal Realm.

150
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:12,190
For some, as the debt is being repaid, the two end up being together for a lifetime.

151
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:14,000
For some, once the debt has been repaid,

152
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,330
the two separate and the relationship no longer exists.

153
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:21,860
Tell me. Which type of relationship do the emperor and I have?

154
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,370
I was the one who asked the question.

155
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:29,570
Young Highness, why did you throw such a difficult question to me?

156
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,470
Father!

157
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,950
Where are you trying to escape to?

158
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,430
I'm not filial.

159
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,910
Father, please beat me.

160
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,420
Father, I was wrong.

161
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,390
Please don't beat me.

162
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:44,150
Second Older Brother, have mercy.

163
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,930
Fengjiu is the only granddaughter of our Bai family.

164
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:50,800
If you really beat her half to death, we won't be able to explain.

165
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,290
She has completely ruined the Bai family's reputation.

166
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,390
I might as well beat her to death!

167
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,810
This won't do. Second Brother, look.

168
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,130
Eldest Brother and I don't have any children yet,

169
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:02,660
and Young Fifth's wedding is also nowhere in sight.

170
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:07,320
Hundreds of years later, the monarchess of Green Hill position will be passed down to this brat, Fengjiu.

171
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,180
You must be merciful to her.

172
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:15,310
Actually, Aunt has a son.

173
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:19,020
- What?
- What?

174
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:22,520
It's that son of the crown prince.

175
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,730
Although he's a stepson, he's still considered a son of hers. Right?

176
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,300
Oh, it's Monarch Ye Hua.

177
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,840
Fengjiu, you scared me to death.

178
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:41,070
Ye Hua already has a son?

179
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,490
Second Older Brother, you didn't hear about this?

180
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,720
People have mentioned this to me before.

181
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,120
Several hundred years ago, he and I met by fate.

182
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,420
I helped him to squash the rebellion in North Wilderness.

183
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,910
He has quite the bearing of a crown prince.

184
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:58,430
It's a pity that the Dragon Tribe is different from our Nine-Tailed Fox Tribe.

185
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,600
They love to expand their harem.

186
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,580
Before Young Fifth has married him, she already has a stepson.

187
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,930
He's also the most favored since he's the eldest son.

188
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:09,970
I really can't accept this disrespect.

189
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:16,240
The only one who could sadden Young Fifth growing up was High God Mo Yuan.

190
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,180
Just you wait.

191
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:21,680
Perhaps, this engagement will be canceled soon.

192
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,550
Come here!

193
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:32,960
Second Older Brother, cool down. Spare her first.

194
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:37,860
Young Fifth is alone right now in the Western Sea guarding Mo Yuan's spirit.

195
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,740
I fear she will be bored. Let Fengjiu go over and accompany her.

196
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:48,020
Aren't you going to the Western Sea? Go and look for your aunt.

197
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,080
Yes, Fourth Uncle.

198
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,850
Fortunately, Fourth Uncle was there. Fortunately, Fourth Uncle was there.

199
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:13,740
You are... Yuanzhen?

200
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,750
I am.

201
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,030
Are you here to see my aunt? She's not in the fox den.

202
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,860
No, no.

203
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:25,150
Yes... But also no.

204
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,110
Is it yes or no? Tell me now.

205
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,480
I need to leave soon.

206
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,320
Actually, I'm here to look for you.

207
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:37,380
In the royal palace in the Mortal Realm, you and I...

208
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,990
There was nothing going on between us.

209
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:44,140
Frankly, I'm not interested in you at all.

210
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:47,380
Then... at the pond...

211
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,560
I had no other choice but to do that at the pond.

212
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,860
To make it short, Emperor Dong Hua and I had a love tribulation.

213
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,250
You were implicated.

214
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,710
That's good then.

215
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,730
Why are you back again?

216
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,940
Is your tribulation over?

217
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:08,730
Originally, it wasn't supposed to be so fast, but since Emperor was my father in the Mortal Realm,

218
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:13,750
and I caused him to die from anger, I died for my sin in the Mortal Realm and returned.

219
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,130
The sixty-year tribulation wasn't fully completed.

220
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:21,400
Turns out I implicated you. My apologies.

221
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,120
You didn't. I gained a blessing from that misfortune.

222
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:31,060
Because of the fate between you and the emperor, I was able to return early and be re-ranked.

223
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,050
I should thank Your Highness instead.

224
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:34,640
No need.

225
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,670
If there's nothing else from you, I'm leaving first.

226
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:46,190
Oh no. I forgot to tell her to deliver my greetings to Teacher.

227
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,100
You saw the dragon energy of Kunlun Void and that's why you are back?

228
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,760
- Yes, we saw it.
- We did.

229
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,160
Great. Great.

230
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,750
- Great. Really great.
 - Yes. Yes.

231
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,270
- This is great!
- Yes.

232
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,390
- Where's Zi Lan?
- Zi Lan?

233
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:06,840
After Winged Monarch told him that he saw Si Yin, he went down the mountain.

234
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,370
I believe it has been for several days.

235
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:10,570
I don't know where he is.

236
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:16,530
He and Seventeenth fought the most in Kunlun Void.

237
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:22,240
After all these years, everyone knows he misses Seventeenth the most.

238
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,240
- That's right.
- Yes.

239
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:57,280
70,000 years ago,

240
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,540
Teacher sacrificed his spirit as an offering to the Donghuang Bell.

241
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:03,720
Junior Ling Yu died at the riverside of Ruoshui River.

242
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:09,700
Young Seventeenth also took Teacher's divine body and went missing.

243
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:13,620
Now, there's the vibration of dragon energy in Kunlun Void and the bell has sounded.

244
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,950
The disciples rushed back to Kunlun Void from all corners of the world.

245
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:20,530
We don't know when Teacher will be back,

246
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:24,350
but I believe that he will keep his words.

247
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:26,870
He will revive Kunlun Void for sure.

248
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,560
Teacher,

249
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,230
your disciples have returned.

250
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:04,830
Teacher! Your disciples have returned!

251
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,830
When Mochi was drunk yesterday,

252
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:48,480
Nai Nai said that the little prince had inherited his father's poor tolerance for alcohol.

253
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,600
One, two, three, four, five.

254
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,770
Five urns of wine.

255
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:56,130
His alcohol tolerance isn't bad at all.

256
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,670
You're here for the Soul-Gathering Lamp?

257
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,360
Come with me.

258
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,140
The Soul-Gathering Lamp is here.

259
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:52,370
Put this lamp at Die Yong's bedside for three days.

260
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:55,080
Mo Yuan's soul will gather there.

261
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,910
You must remember, throughout those three days, the light must not go out.

262
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,860
You can't use your magic to protect it either.

263
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,940
You have to keep it lit by yourself.

264
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:06,990
I got it. I'll be extremely cautious.

265
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,940
I'm worrying for nothing.

266
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:15,150
Of course, you'll dutifully take care of Mo Yuan.

267
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:30,240
Don't die.

268
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:36,000
I sense the aura of a mortal on this lamp.

269
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,840
This...

270
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,210
I've used this lamp before.

271
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:50,300
I remember Nai Nai telling me

272
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:55,120
you tried using the Soul-Gathering Lamp to rebuild the body of Mochi's mother.

273
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:59,580
I'll take this lamp then.

274
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:14,940
I know that this lamp is the sacred artifact of the Heavenly Tribe.

275
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:19,430
Is it appropriate for you to give it to me so easily?

276
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:24,410
Before I came to borrow this lamp,

277
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:27,380
I thought that if I borrow this lamp,

278
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:32,370
the debts between Green Hill and Heavenly Tribe will be cleared, and the slate will be wiped clean.

279
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:36,640
But you gave it to me so easily,

280
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,200
I... I'm really touched.

281
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:45,580
You've helped me so much.

282
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:48,870
I should repay your kindness.

283
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:51,680
What is it you need? Tell me.

284
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,830
I'll do my best to help you.

285
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:58,500
There's nothing I want.

286
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,910
Is there really nothing that you want?

287
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:06,880
Then... I'll head back now.

288
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,380
What I want...

289
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:19,040
All I have ever wanted, has always been you.

290
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:25,100
You want... me?

291
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,320
Forget that I said anything.

292
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,180
I should head back now.

293
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:53,150
Ye Hua...

294
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:08,040
You—

295
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,990
What I've thought during the days is reflected in my thoughts at night.

296
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:20,620
Do I already think of Ye Hua in such a lustful way?

297
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,850
Where... Where are my clothes?

298
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:31,130
I find them troublesome, so I took them off with magic.

299
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:38,300
You... You...

300
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:42,150
You want to be with me?

301
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:44,960
I want to be with you.

302
00:24:55,610 --> 00:25:01,490
Tonight might be the last time I can have you completely to myself.

303
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:06,380
Even if you only have Mo Yuan on your mind.

304
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,850
Why aren't you asleep yet?

305
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:33,900
In the past, I always heard Fourth Older Brother talk about your valiance.

306
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:37,480
He said that in any battle that you've engaged in,

307
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,690
no one has been able to defeat you.

308
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,010
Then, how did you almost lose your life in the war against the Merpeople Tribe?

309
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,540
If I hadn't purposely gone easy on them,

310
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:55,890
how could a mere Merpeople Tribe hurt me?

311
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:58,700
Why did you go easy on them?

312
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:09,340
All my life, I have never envied anyone apart from my second uncle.

313
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:14,400
Have you heard that he eloped with Shao Xin?

314
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,020
Have you forgotten? Him and Shao Xin eloping...

315
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,980
I was involved in that.

316
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:29,230
My second uncle sought love and found it.

317
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:32,070
It might have been a tough journey,

318
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:34,660
but it ended well.

319
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:41,900
The Heavenly Monarch doted on him, but he never made him the crown prince.

320
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,710
Without the binding title of the crown prince,

321
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:50,670
it was easy for him to get away.

322
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:56,970
What about you?

323
00:26:58,330 --> 00:26:59,860
Me?

324
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:04,190
Although I'm the crown prince,

325
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:09,100
I'm fortunate that the woman that I love is High Goddess Bai Qian of Green Hill.

326
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:22,670
- Qian Qian.
- Yeah.

327
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,430
If one day,

328
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,850
someone took away your eyes,

329
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:34,910
would you forgive that person?

330
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:42,510
In Heaven and Earth, who would dare take my eyes?

331
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:46,460
What if that person was me?

332
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:52,030
You?

333
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,890
If you really did take my eyes,

334
00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:00,960
then it'll be over between us.

335
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:13,660
That Soul-Gathering Lamp.

336
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:17,570
You must remember to keep it lit for 3 days.

337
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,860
Not even for a moment less.

338
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:23,490
You cannot use magical powers to protect it. You must personally look after it.

339
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:27,820
I know.

340
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:31,250
I will be careful.

341
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:33,080
Don't worry.

342
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,050
Go to sleep.

343
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:56,790
- When I'm gone, you must not leave the woods.
- Okay.

344
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:59,870
If you feel lonely, call my name in the mirror.

345
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:02,510
But you must remember, you must not leave this place.

346
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:04,190
All right.

347
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:09,250
Why does this mortal woman look exactly like me?

348
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:14,430
Ye Hua! Ye Hua!

349
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:19,910
Ye Hua! Ye Hua! Ye Hua!

350
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:24,440
- Ye Hua!
- Didn't your husband tell you not to leave the woods?

351
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,560
Ye Hua!

352
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,620
What's been happening to me recently?

353
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:45,140
I've been having such weird dreams.

354
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,780
Isn't this my own room?

355
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:53,100
Did Ye Hua bring me back?

356
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:02,250
Since Ye Hua and I share mutual affections,

357
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:05,420
the engagement cannot be canceled.

358
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,900
Immortal.

359
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,530
Is the crown prince awake?

360
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:28,490
Immortal, the crown prince has returned to the Heavenly Palace.

361
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:30,490
He's really very busy with his work.

362
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,700
Did he say when he's coming back?

363
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,650
He didn't.

364
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:47,940
Aunt, I'm back.

365
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:55,970
My Xiao Jiu is finally back. Well?

366
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:59,530
Did you repay the emperor for saving your life?

367
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:04,020
I did but whether I still owe him, I don't know.

368
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:10,450
Looks like our little brat has been wounded.

369
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:12,370
Where's the injury?

370
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,420
Is it there?

371
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:21,380
Aunt, you already know.

372
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:29,890
It's okay. Stop crying.

373
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:57,920
The Mystical Mushroom shouldn't be kept in this world.

374
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:03,780
I'm willing to go there to destroy it.

375
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:06,350
Ye Hua,

376
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,740
even if it's not destroyed,

377
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:12,430
nobody can obtain it that easily.

378
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:17,980
Do you really need to do something so difficult yet unrewarding?

379
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:21,590
Certain things, if they are left in this world for even a day more,

380
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:24,130
there will be more hidden danger.

381
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:26,170
You are right.

382
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:34,170
Ye Hua, my energy for the past few years is unlike before.

383
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:40,450
I'm preparing to hand over my throne to you except that it lacks the right opportunity.

384
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:45,170
If this time, you can fight the four ferocious beasts...

385
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,760
Fine.

386
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:52,530
I permit you to destroy the Mystical Mushroom and get rid of future troubles forever.

387
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,310
Thank you, Heavenly Monarch, for your permission.

388
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:06,520
Go to the Heavenly Realm and select 30,000 soldiers.

389
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:09,570
I would like to go alone.

390
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,430
You want to go alone?

391
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:13,390
Yes.

392
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:18,530
I would like to go quietly lest this information spreads out and attracts unnecessary troubles.

393
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:21,450
After all, the Mythical Mushroom is an evil item.

394
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:24,890
Perhaps, many people are secretly casting their greedy eyes on it.

395
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:28,850
But will you be able to handle the four ferocious beasts?

396
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:31,010
I'll ascend to your throne in the future.

397
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:37,290
If I can't even handle the four ferocious beasts, how can I convince the immortals of Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses?

398
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:38,990
I only need three days.

399
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:41,310
I will return in one piece.

400
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:44,410
Fine.

401
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,020
Three days then.

402
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,550
I will wait for your good news.

403
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:51,080
All right.

404
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:07,490
Immortal?

405
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:09,850
Si Yin?

406
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:11,370
She's a woman.

407
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:13,820
How could she be my seventeenth junior brother?

408
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:16,800
Could she be Xuan Nü?

409
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,230
Speak! Why are you in the Western Seas?

410
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,620
Eldest Senior Brother,

411
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:35,010
I'm Seventeenth.

412
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,290
Are you really Seventeenth?

413
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,640
You are my seventeenth junior brother?

414
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:55,090
That year, I was stubborn and mischievous and took Teacher's divine body without permission.

415
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:58,030
I felt ashamed to face everyone.

416
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:03,530
Junior brother, you made it so hard for us to find you.

417
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:05,790
It has been 70,000 years.

418
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:08,490
I finally found you.

419
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,080
Eldest Senior Brother.

420
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:17,340
Why are you dressed as a woman?

421
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:21,250
The people from the palace said that Zhe Yan sent an immortal to live here.

422
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,850
Is it you?

423
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:27,130
For 70,000 years, you have been living in Ten Miles of Peach Blossom?

424
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:32,120
I am a woman.

425
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:36,560
To have Teacher accept me as a disciple in Kunlun Void, I dressed as a man.

426
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,180
What?

427
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:46,330
I am the daughter, Bai Qian, of Fox Emperor Bai Zhi.

428
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:48,550
I hid this from the brothers and Teacher.

429
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:50,450
I was wrong.

430
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:54,970
- You are really a woman?
- Yes.

431
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:01,940
You... You tricked us for a long time.

432
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,750
Bai Qian of Green Hill.

433
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:07,090
Bai Qian of Green Hill?

434
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:12,810
No wonder hundreds of years ago, when Qing Cang broke out from the bell,

435
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:15,420
it was Bai Qian from Green Hill who sealed him up again

436
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,160
and returned peace to Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses again.

437
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,270
No wonder.

438
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:24,220
Only disciples from Kunlun Void could have done that.

439
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,020
Great.

440
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,860
You did well.

441
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:31,730
Seventeenth, let me ask you.

442
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:34,410
Where's Teacher's divine body?

443
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:37,720
You should know that, a few days ago, the dragon energy in Kunlun Void vibrated.

444
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,010
It's a sign that Teacher is coming back.

445
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:42,650
There was a sign in Kunlun Void?

446
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:45,190
Could you have known that he's returning?

447
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:48,660
I knew.

448
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,320
Ye Hua said that as long as we guard this Soul-Gathering Lamp and not let the light get extinguished for three days,

449
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,420
Teacher can then wake up.

450
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:07,030
Teacher's spirit is really inside my eldest brother?

451
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:09,040
I used the Soul-Pursuing Spell to check it.

452
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,940
It's true.

453
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,770
No wonder Eldest Brother was sick for 600 years,

454
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:15,900
but we were unable to find out the cause.

455
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,730
So, he was guarding the spirit of Teacher all this time.

456
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:23,340
What happens once we completely gather the spirit of Teacher?

457
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:28,140
Zhe Yan said that he has a way.

458
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,860
Aunt, I borrowed their kitchen and cooked you some dishes.

459
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,640
Quickly, come and taste them.

460
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:52,560
Our Young Jiu is really good, especially your culinary skills.

461
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,530
In that past month that you were not around, I missed you so much.

462
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:59,410
My father always told me that leaving me in Green Hill for you to take care of was just exhausting you.

463
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:03,510
But from the look of it, I'm the one who's tired from taking care of you.

464
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:05,780
Exactly this taste.

465
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:08,530
I heard from Mi Gu that while I was not around,

466
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:11,320
- it was His Highness the Crown Prince cooking for you?
- Yes.

467
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,640
Yes.

468
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,920
This past period, it has been hard for him.

469
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:18,680
Aunt, you're blushing?

470
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:22,810
So disrespectful. Are you mocking me?

471
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:25,730
Aunt, you're in love.

472
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:28,250
I'll pour you some wine.

473
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:31,220
Let's celebrate an iron tree like you for finally blossoming, for finally having a man you like.

474
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:34,660
Also, this person is even your future husband.

475
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,660
It's really perfect.

476
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:39,860
I'll accept your congratulations, but I won't drink the wine.

477
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:44,150
Why? Don't you drink regardless if you're happy or upset?

478
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:47,100
Moreover, we have found the spirit of High God Mo Yuan.

479
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:50,070
You must drink this wine.

480
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:53,820
Because I must watch over this Soul-Gathering Lamp for three straight days without any sleep;

481
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:56,060
hence, I can't drink wine.

482
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:08,980
I took this Soul-Gathering Lamp before exactly to be used for High God Mo Yuan.

483
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:12,810
After going around in circles, it was still used for him.

484
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:15,110
How did you get it, Aunt?

485
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,100
Ye Hua personally delivered it here.

486
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,660
- His Highness the Crown Prince personally delivered it here?
- Yes.

487
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,360
That's right.

488
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:26,200
For Crown Prince to willingly take this lamp out,

489
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,000
it looks like he has let go of Su Su.

490
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,840
He will probably treat Aunt well.

491
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,750
What's wrong, Young Jiu?

492
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:39,270
I'm just thinking...

493
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:42,770
Is this Soul-Gathering Lamp really that useful?

494
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:44,810
Don't belittle that lamp.

495
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:49,620
Look. Aren't I using it now to recover the spirit of Teacher?

496
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:55,940
That's right.

497
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:22,750
Every year, at this time, the osmanthus flowers in the palace will bloom.

498
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:26,430
Every time, Ah Li will develop rashes.

499
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:30,100
You must boil autumn sunflowers then wipe the rashes with the liquid to abate his symptoms.

500
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,580
Your Highness the Crown Prince instructs that to me every year.

501
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:33,950
I will never forget.

502
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:39,860
Go now.

503
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:50,200
Mighty Monarch, those Four Great Mythical Beasts have profound cultivation.

504
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,280
Why won't you inform the Heavenly Monarch about this and take an army there?

505
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,830
I don't want to startle so many people.

506
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:59,130
Then, give me permission to go to Yingzhou in the Eastern Sea with you.

507
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:02,740
Although my cultivation is below yours, at the critical moment,

508
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,960
I can help block the formidable power of those four great ferocious beasts.

509
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,170
With your cultivation, you won't be able to help me even if you go.

510
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:17,410
In this trip, I'm hell-bent on getting the Mythical Mushroom.

511
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:24,230
If I don't return in 3 days, remember to not let anyone get near Yingzhou,

512
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:28,040
especially High Goddess Bai Qian of Green Hill.

513
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,000
Understand?

514
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:35,190
I understand.

515
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,490
”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

516
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:11,520
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

517
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,120
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

518
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:19,540
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

519
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:29,050
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

520
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,840
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

521
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:38,140
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

522
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:43,800
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

523
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:50,380
♫ All are just illusions ♫

524
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:57,090
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

525
00:42:57,090 --> 00:43:02,350
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

526
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:06,790
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

527
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:12,970
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

528
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:18,410
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

529
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:23,620
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

530
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:26,370
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

531
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:35,990
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from
my previous life ♫

532
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:47,550
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

533
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:53,150
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

534
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:57,520
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

535
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:03,620
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

536
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:08,900
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

537
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:14,320
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

538
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,040
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

539
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:26,250
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

540
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:38,390
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
