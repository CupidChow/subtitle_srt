1
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,120
You can't be...

2
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,600
the Eldest Young Master Rui, right?

3
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,880
Why do you sound

4
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,080
a bit dismissive?

5
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,120
Everyone knows the Eldest Young Master Rui
is good-for-nothing.

6
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,520
And

7
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,840
he's already married.

8
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,240
I'm not the Eldest Young Master Rui.

9
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm the even less favored Second Young Master Rui.

10
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,320
Second Young Master Rui?

11
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,320
Never heard of you.

12
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,800
Second Young Master, wait for me!

13
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,320
This is your Green Pine Courtyard.

14
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,400
Green Pine Courtyard...

15
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,160
I saw

16
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,800
they planted a pine tree here,

17
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,680
so that's how it got its name.

18
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,040
If you don't like it,

19
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,120
you can change it anytime.

20
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,000
I like it very much.

21
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,640
Can you hurry up?

22
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,360
Second Young Master! Second Young Master!

23
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,000
Why are you walking so slowly, little maid?

24
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,720
Let me tell you,

25
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,440
you can't even keep up with the princess's carriage in the palace.

26
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,760
My legs aren't as long as yours.

27
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,680
I can't walk fast.

28
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,280
Yu'er.

29
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:41,880
Guess what,

30
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,960
this little girl

31
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,040
was sent by whom?

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Princess Chunxi! Princess Chunxi!

33
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,080
How did you know?

34
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:47,680
Well...

35
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,320
Princess Chunxi

36
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,160
just snuck away from me.

37
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,840
Weren't you having fun sneaking off?

38
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,320
How could a princess sneak away?

39
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,200
I am generous.

40
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,400
I forgive you.

41
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,160
Thank you, Princess.

42
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,240
Your Highness.

43
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,000
You snuck out of the palace, didn't you?

44
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,080
I did.

45
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:17,800
But...

46
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,920
Your Highness, please return quickly.

47
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,960
If the Queen Mother and Your Majesty find out,

48
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,920
they'll worry again.

49
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,080
But I haven't finished...

50
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,480
I request the Princess to return to the palace.

51
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,440
Our family

52
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,240
has two carriages, right?

53
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,520
How do we split them? It's not proper.

54
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,600
No, don't!

55
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,240
Princess, please don't!

56
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,880
I'll strangle you!

57
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,520
Princess!

58
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,800
Princess, please don't!

59
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,000
That's true.

60
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,040
Are you feeling better?

61
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,600
It's so hot.

62
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,840
Prime Minister Ming's daughter,

63
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,560
Ming Wanwan.

64
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,680
Twenty-one years old.

65
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,040
Ming Wanwan presents herself.

66
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,600
Miss Ming enters the palace daily.

67
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,680
No need to see her again, right?

68
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,400
Today is not like other days.

69
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,000
Let Miss Ming present herself.

70
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,640
Ming Wanwan presents herself.

71
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,320
Your servant Ming Wanwan greets Your Majesty.

72
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,040
Queen Mother.

73
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,880
Rise.

74
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,560
Sit.

75
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,400
Thank you, Queen Mother.

76
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,000
On my way here,

77
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,560
I saw the oleanders in your courtyard in full bloom.

78
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,760
They're truly beautiful.

79
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,680
I haven't left the palace lately.

80
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,160
I haven't seen such a sight.

81
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,040
Did Your Majesty see them on your way here?

82
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,400
Their graceful form and sturdy stems

83
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,960
are as lush as green shade and red blossoms.

84
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,200
The oleanders in Mother's palace

85
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,440
are the best in the palace.

86
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,040
May I be honored with a branch from the Queen Mother?

87
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,200
To take home and admire?

88
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,520
If you like,

89
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,480
someone will pick a branch for you.

90
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,560
That's all.

91
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,160
Thank you for your grace, Queen Mother.

92
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,760
It's windy today.

93
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,040
I heard Prime Minister Ming cough at court this morning.

94
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,080
I'll have the imperial physician prepare some medicine.

95
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,760
Take it back for Prime Minister Ming.

96
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,200
I thank Your Majesty on my father's behalf.

97
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,120
Prime Minister Ming works tirelessly for state affairs.

98
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,880
It's just a prescription.

99
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,040
No need for formalities.

100
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,200
Go ahead.

101
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,920
I take my leave.

102
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:34,920
Your Majesty.

103
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,000
The Ministry of Revenue has memorials

104
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,320
that need your approval today.

105
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,240
If that's the case,

106
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,080
state affairs come first.

107
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:42,960
But...

108
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,440
The nation cannot go a day without an empress.

109
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,480
Do you understand, Your Majesty?

110
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,880
I understand, Mother.

111
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,080
Wanwan grew up with you.

112
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,880
She is gentle and virtuous.

113
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,200
You've met so many court ladies.

114
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,560
Your Majesty,

115
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,120
what are your thoughts?

116
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,040
I'll follow Mother's arrangements.

117
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,920
I take my leave.

118
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,040
Go ahead.

119
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,320
Your Majesty.

120
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,400
There are countless beautiful sights in the palace.

121
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,720
But in the end, they're trapped in this small world.

122
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,600
If they cross the palace walls,

123
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,840
their branches will be cut off.

124
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,320
No freedom.

125
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,880
As long as they bloom,

126
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,040
they will be seen.

127
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,000
Anywhere, they become a beautiful sight.

128
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,480
As long as the right person sees them,

129
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,560
that's their best home.

130
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,120
If Your Majesty doesn't wish to see me,

131
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,360
I'll only serve in the Queen Mother's palace.

132
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,720
I won't trouble Your Majesty.

133
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,400
I...

134
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,680
That's not what I meant.

135
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,400
I have other matters.

136
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,840
Stay and talk with the Queen Mother before you leave.

137
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,640
Yes, Your Majesty.

138
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,200
Rui Yu, I'm sorry.

139
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,680
Sorry for causing you trouble.

140
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,000
Princess, you should go inside quickly.

141
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,640
May I send an apology gift to your residence?

142
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,720
No need.

143
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,840
Earlier,

144
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,840
I offended Madam Rui.

145
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,880
Please don't take it to heart.

146
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,280
They aren't upset.

147
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,640
A few days ago,

148
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,000
they even said they'd invite the Princess to the housewarming banquet.

149
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,120
Really?

150
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,080
Of course.

151
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,720
Then be sure to tell me the date of the banquet.

152
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,520
Alright.

153
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,760
Hurry back.

154
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:11,880
Rui Yu.

155
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,760
I'm leaving, then.

156
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,360
When did we say

157
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,760
we'd hold a housewarming banquet?

158
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,440
Just teasing the kid.

159
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:22,920
Let's go.

160
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,160
Your second brother

161
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,800
lies without even blinking.

162
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,360
He's always been like that.

163
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,800
But

164
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,480
this housewarming banquet

165
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,560
is actually a good idea.

166
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,280
A tranquil, elegant home.

167
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,320
Free and at ease.

168
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,280
Junior Sister.

169
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,160
Miss Qiao.

170
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:58,720
Junior Sister.

171
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,240
My father wants to take me matchmaking again.

172
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,280
Junior Sister, please save me!

173
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:04,680
Mas—

174
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,200
Who are you?

175
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:16,800
I...

176
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,640
Who are you looking for?

177
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,880
I'm looking for Rui Yu.

178
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,920
They don't seem to be home.

179
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:22,880
I see.

180
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,240
Then...

181
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,680
You are...?

182
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,960
I'm a relative of the Rui family.

183
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,480
Qiao Youyi.

184
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,200
Qiao Youyi.

185
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,720
Darn it.

186
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,640
My father is chasing after me.

187
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,080
Don't tell anyone you saw me.

188
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,760
Keep it secret.

189
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,680
Or I'll beat you up.

190
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,680
Today

191
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,320
is our housewarming banquet.

192
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,000
We've thought it over carefully.

193
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,320
Our two families

194
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,960
haven't had a chance to meet.

195
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,760
So we thought

196
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,080
to hold this banquet

197
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,520
and invite all our elders

198
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,800
for a small gathering.

199
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,840
Dear in-law,

200
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,280
I've long admired your reputation.

201
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,880
But never visited your home.

202
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,640
Forgive me, forgive me.

203
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,840
Your fame spreads far and wide.

204
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:23,920
Today

205
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,480
to finally meet you

206
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,200
is a great honor.

207
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:28,960
You're too kind.

208
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,000
Cheers!

209
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,280
Everyone, let's drink.

210
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,880
Come, come, let's drink!

211
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,920
These two are—

212
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,440
This is my master, General Qiao.

213
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,200
And this is my senior, Qiao Youyi.

214
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,040
Qiao Youyi.

215
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,440
We must drink—come on!

216
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,120
I'll finish mine.

217
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,480
You two, drink as you please.

218
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,160
Junior Sister.

219
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,840
You asked me and my father here—

220
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,920
It can't be just for the housewarming, right?

221
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,320
It's not just for the new house banquet.

222
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,760
Next month

223
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,520
is my wife's birthday.

224
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,080
I want to hold a birthday banquet for her.

225
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,040
We'll invite officials then

226
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,200
so both civil and military officials can celebrate.

227
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,040
Celebrate with the civil officials?

228
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,520
Isn't that a bit far-fetched?

229
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,120
Both big families are here.

230
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,040
Why is that far-fetched?

231
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,400
That's not the same.

232
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,160
We are

233
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,160
in-laws.

234
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,360
What do we have to do with those civil officials?

235
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,320
I want to use this chance

236
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,280
to resolve civil-military discord.

237
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,480
For the generals

238
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,720
to gain a place at court.

239
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,080
To earn a seat.

240
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,240
Decades of grudges

241
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,000
can't be solved by one banquet.

242
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,440
Father,

243
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:40,880
I know.

244
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,040
But if we do nothing,

245
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,240
these grudges

246
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,240
will last for decades, even centuries.

247
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,680
Civil officials govern the nation.

248
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,840
Military officials secure the land.

249
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,080
Since ancient times,

250
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,800
civil and military must work together.

251
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,600
Only then can the country thrive.

252
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,320
We want to do this

253
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,600
to contribute to Ling An.

254
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,080
To fit so many people here

255
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,880
then this garden for the banquet

256
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,320
really needs a thorough renovation

257
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,160
Eldest Brother

258
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,520
I'll provide the people, you do the work

259
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,240
for this job

260
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,320
let's split it thirty-seventy

261
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,440
Why split it thirty-seventy?

262
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,360
Are you treating this like business?

263
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,360
You want to ask Yu'er for money?

264
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,080
What kind of eldest brother are you?

265
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,400
Father, is that what I meant?

266
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,440
He wants a thirty-seventy split

267
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,720
I mean I'll do thirty percent of the work

268
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,800
and you do seventy percent

269
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,920
Why should I do seventy percent?

270
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,640
Because you're the eldest brother

271
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,960
The money for fixing the courtyard

272
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,160
I've already prepared it

273
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,320
I'll leave it to Eldest and Second Brother

274
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,080
It's no trouble at all

275
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,120
As the eldest brother

276
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:37,960
it's my duty

277
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,880
Good things are always born of thrift

278
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,200
Since ancient times, melons

279
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,000
are sweet after bitterness

280
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,960
No, no, no

281
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,760
Don't touch me

282
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,120
Everyone, slow down

283
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,160
Don't bump into anything

284
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:53,720
Alright, alright

285
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,680
Just put it here, that's fine

286
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,840
Put it down, put it down

287
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,520
Bring that stool over here for me

288
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,040
Careful, slow down

289
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:58,680
Eldest Brother

290
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,320
Don't, Second Brother

291
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,600
Don't call me brother

292
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,240
You are my eldest brother

293
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:04,760
What did I do?

294
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,920
Just stand here

295
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,600
Give me a hand

296
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,960
Isn't Eldest Brother here?

297
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,560
I won't show off in front of the expert

298
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,120
I say

299
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,560
Eldest Young Master, Second Young Master, thank you

300
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,920
Why is he the one working hard?

301
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,200
Open your mouth, I'll feed you

302
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,880
Why are you so gross?

303
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,760
Pour it yourself

304
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,840
Day after day

305
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,120
You spilled it all over me

306
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,280
The dishes are ready

307
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:42,960
Put it down

308
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,000
People aren't here yet

309
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,800
I'll just have a taste

310
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,320
Come

311
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,000
What is it, really?

312
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,080
You'll know when you come over

313
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,240
Look

314
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,720
These are medicinal dishes my senior and I developed

315
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,720
Try them

316
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,600
Tastes good

317
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,440
But the herbal flavor is a bit strong

318
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,720
Alright, got it

319
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,160
This dish is a bit sweet

320
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,480
This fish

321
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,200
I made it

322
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,640
It's delicious

323
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,080
Are all these meant to be eaten raw?

324
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,520
This is a southern specialty

325
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,600
Mushroom Hot Pot

326
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,320
My senior and I discussed it

327
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,640
We'll place a small pot on each table

328
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,800
with broth as the base

329
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,040
and assorted mushrooms

330
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,160
Cook and eat on the spot

331
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,840
It has a wild, earthy aroma

332
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,360
and is fresh and tasty

333
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,800
It's a unique flavor

334
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,400
Everyone, try it quickly

335
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,760
Since the head of the family said so

336
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:45,960
we can finally eat, right?

337
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,400
Eat, eat

338
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:54,760
Yu'er

339
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:55,960
Everyone's here

340
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:56,920
Good

341
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,080
Greetings, Sir

342
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,120
Madam, please take your seat

343
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,720
All the generals are here

344
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,000
Madam Rui is a general's daughter after all

345
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,000
We can't leave the generals out

346
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,560
Civil and military have been at odds for years

347
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,440
The generals have declined

348
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,960
Coming to a civil officials' banquet

349
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,600
won't feel uncomfortable, right?

350
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,400
Why worry so much?

351
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,320
Ladies and gentlemen

352
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,440
Sir Liu

353
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,320
Greetings, generals

354
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,000
Sir Rui

355
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,280
This

356
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,960
is the celebratory wine I prepared

357
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,440
It's osmanthus wine

358
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,080
Only five jars are made each month

359
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,240
I managed to get one jar just for you

360
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,080
How could I accept this?

361
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:40,880
Fine wine

362
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,160
should be shared

363
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,400
Why not open it at today's banquet

364
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,120
and uncork this wine

365
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,520
Ladies and gentlemen

366
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,440
Generals

367
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,800
Fine wine is rare

368
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,440
Let's all drink together

369
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,360
What do you think?

370
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,240
Good

371
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,520
Generals

372
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,400
We

373
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,680
shall drink this wine together

374
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,000
General Qiao

375
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,600
Sir Rui

376
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,440
Civil officials and scholars

377
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,400
serve in court with my son-in-law

378
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,080
In the future

379
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,360
please support my son-in-law

380
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,480
No need to say that

381
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,120
We rely on Sir Rui

382
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,240
Sir Rui is the rising star of the court

383
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,200
Except for his mentor, the Left Prime Minister

384
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,440
all the ministers in court

385
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,520
want to get closer to Sir Rui

386
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,720
Prime Minister Ming is here

387
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,240
Prime Minister Ming has arrived

388
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,760
Prime Minister Ming, Prime Minister Ming

389
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,600
Please come inside, please

390
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:48,840
Prime Minister Ming

391
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,760
Sir Rui

392
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,200
Last time you moved to a new home

393
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,160
I couldn't send a gift to congratulate you

394
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,520
Please forgive me

395
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,920
Prime Minister Ming, you're too polite

396
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,200
Please take your seat

397
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:01,720
Prime Minister Ming

398
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,240
Prime Minister Ming, Prime Minister Ming

399
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,440
Ladies and gentlemen

400
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,440
Let us drink this cup together

401
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:38,960
Your Majesty

402
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,480
Today is your wedding banquet

403
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,720
No need for formalities

404
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:49,960
Your Majesty

405
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,160
Is the food not to Your Majesty's taste?

406
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,560
At this banquet,

407
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,600
everyone has their own agenda.

408
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,160
It's truly fascinating.

409
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,440
Please, please.

410
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,560
Come, come.

411
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,520
Miss

412
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,760
Prince Pan is here.

413
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,840
Why is he here?

414
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,040
The dishes will be served soon.

415
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,160
Have Qiao Youyi

416
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,360
go keep an eye on the kitchen.

417
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,600
Make sure nothing goes wrong.

418
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,320
Alright.

419
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,400
Yu'er

420
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,720
Princess

421
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,040
Second Brother is being ridiculous.

422
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,280
I will send someone to escort Princess Chunxi back to the palace.

423
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,680
We mustn't let the Queen Mother worry.

424
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,760
It's not his fault.

425
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,120
I asked him to help me.

426
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,960
I just have something I want to ask you.

427
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,280
Yu'er, please answer me honestly.

428
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,600
Princess, please speak your mind.

429
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:53,880
You

430
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,120
do you truly love Miss Nan Chenxiao?

431
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,440
I just wanted to ask.

432
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,040
Just wanted to know

433
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,800
Yu'er's true feelings.

434
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,320
You're such a silly girl.

435
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,840
Forgive my dullness.

436
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:11,760
Before,

437
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,320
I only knew to serve the Emperor.

438
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,640
Doing all I could.

439
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,960
Serving the country and its people.

440
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,320
Later, Your Majesty granted me a marriage.

441
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:19,920
At first,

442
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,880
I worried she might be wronged.

443
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,520
I only knew

444
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,720
to fulfill my duty as a husband.

445
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:26,960
But now,

446
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,600
my feelings for Nan Chenxiao are sincere.

447
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:33,920
Sorry, Prince Pan.

448
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,400
This way, please.

449
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,480
Madam Rui and Lord Rui

450
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,760
are truly a loving couple.

451
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,760
Prince Pan, you flatter us.

452
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,480
I understand, Yu'er.

453
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,000
Thank you.

454
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:51,520
Your Highness

455
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,440
I have matters to attend to in the front hall.

456
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,640
I won't disturb you further.

457
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,680
I'll visit you again when I get the chance.

458
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,280
I...

459
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,240
Rui Wang

460
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:08,680
Come out.

461
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,080
You caused this mess.

462
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,400
Go and fix it right now.

463
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,120
Second Brother is helping you.

464
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,520
Why aren't things settled yet?

465
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,040
You...

466
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,840
Alright, alright, I'm going!

467
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,800
Don't follow me.

468
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,080
Don't follow me.

469
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,400
Why is it you?

470
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,400
Princess

471
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,760
Are you alright?

472
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,120
It's none of your business. Leave me alone.

473
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,600
Why is that?

474
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,640
Move aside.

475
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,240
How long are you going to follow me?

476
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,280
Until Princess Chunxi

477
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,640
is willing to return.

478
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,200
What if I don't go back?

479
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,440
Then we'll just

480
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,760
keep walking together.

481
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,760
Or

482
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,920
I can take you to the night market.

483
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,360
Really?

484
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,040
Really.

485
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,440
Then wait for me!

486
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,400
Hurry and catch up.

487
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,240
Thank you, Madam Rui, for showing the way.

488
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,480
I'll find a seat myself.

489
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,320
No need to trouble Madam Rui.

490
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,200
There are many guests at the banquet.

491
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,800
If there is any lack in hospitality,

492
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,000
please forgive us, Prince Pan.

493
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,680
I'm the one who came uninvited.

494
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,280
Here, Madam.

495
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:44,800
Eat.

496
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:45,800
This one's cooked.

497
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,760
Prince Pan! Prince Pan!

498
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,320
Everyone,

499
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,400
please be seated.

500
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:51,920
Prince Pan

501
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,160
I offer you a toast.

502
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,920
I didn't expect the Hanlin Academy officials

503
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,600
to be such heavy drinkers.

504
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,360
Civil officials

505
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,120
always enjoy a few drinks.

506
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,920
And write a few poems to express longing.

507
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:05,880
Well,

508
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,400
after drinking, you get drunk.

509
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,120
Over time,

510
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,520
you build up a tolerance.

511
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,520
Scholars always speak so flowery.

512
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,400
Come, cheers!

513
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,120
Hearing Lord Liu say that,

514
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:21,880
well,

515
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,800
it changes my impression of the Hanlin Academy.

516
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,560
I'm just getting by.

517
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,960
Getting into the Hanlin Academy

518
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,560
was pure luck.

519
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,520
I toast to you.

520
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:41,840
Princess

521
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,160
Are you alright?

522
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,480
I'm fine.

523
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,800
Rui Wang is following.

524
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,920
Prince Pan is here too.

525
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:50,720
Yes.

526
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,440
He's probably here to cause trouble.

527
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,880
I've got Qiao Youyi watching the kitchen.

528
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,480
I've stationed people everywhere.

529
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,000
There won't be any problems.

530
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:01,960
Thank you for your help.

531
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,640
Here, Prince Pan.

532
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,160
Prince Pan, Prince Pan.

533
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,080
Please.

534
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,000
Thank you all

535
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,800
for attending my wife's birthday banquet.

536
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,280
My wife and I were just recently married.

537
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,400
We wish to thank Your Majesty for granting our marriage.

538
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,560
Uniting civil and military

539
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,720
as one family.

540
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:28,680
Everyone,

541
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,480
let's drink together.

542
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,600
Wishing Your Majesty good health.

543
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,760
Wishing Ling An prosperity.

544
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,680
Wishing peace to all under heaven.

545
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,560
Wishing Your Majesty good health.

546
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,200
Wishing Ling An prosperity.

547
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,920
Peace to all under heaven.

548
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:54,680
Father

549
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,160
Didn't they tell you not to drink?

550
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,440
I'm happy today.

551
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,400
Let's have a few more drinks.

552
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,360
Brother Liu

553
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,240
Come on

554
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,400
Cheers

555
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,120
Stop drinking.

556
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,120
You child

557
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,760
Prince

558
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,200
Prince

559
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,000
Come, get up first.

560
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,520
Prince, are you feeling unwell?

561
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,680
The Prince was poisoned at Lord Rui's manor.

562
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,240
You owe Qian Yuan an explanation.

563
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,160
Don't worry.

564
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,160
I will surely cure the Prince.

565
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,800
The mushrooms weren't fully cooked.

566
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,320
Liang Jin

567
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,120
Quick, make a bowl of antidote soup.

568
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,160
Yes

569
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,160
Madam Rui just tried to approach the Prince.

570
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,480
What was your intention?

571
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,440
I just wanted the Prince to rest in a side room.

572
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,880
He would feel better that way.

573
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,400
I heard

574
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,160
today's banquet

575
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,920
was personally arranged by Madam Rui.

576
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,920
Now the Prince is poisoned.

577
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,520
If because of this

578
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,560
Qian Yuan is provoked

579
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,280
into war with Ling An, what about the Nan family

580
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,520
—how should they be punished?

581
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,000
Could it be you military officers

582
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,560
just want to start a war

583
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,720
and use this

584
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,240
to regain entry

585
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,480
to the court?

586
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,840
Nonsense!

587
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,680
Our Nan family would never harm the nation.

588
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,080
My lord, the antidote.

589
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:43,960
Prince

590
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,160
Drink this first.

591
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,680
Why are you so agitated?

592
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,880
Our Nan family has always been upright.

593
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,600
How can we let you slander us?

594
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,320
My lords

595
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,360
Please calm down.

596
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,160
Please be seated first.

597
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,160
Please, don't be anxious.

598
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,480
Come, come, have a seat first.

599
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,800
Sit down, sit down.

600
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,640
Prince, how do you feel now?

601
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,320
I'm sorry.

602
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,200
Because of me

603
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,880
your banquet was disrupted.

604
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,280
Everyone

605
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,320
I didn't cook the mushrooms properly.

606
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,640
It has nothing to do with Lord Rui.

607
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,520
As long as the Prince is fine.

608
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,040
Mushrooms

609
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,400
are difficult to cook well.

610
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:30,960
Madam Rui

611
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,080
let the guests cook the mushrooms themselves

612
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,200
—it's quite interesting.

613
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,440
But I didn't know

614
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,560
my lords

615
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,800
and your families

616
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,080
are used to luxury.

617
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,240
You've never done such things.

618
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,520
Now

619
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,080
the Prince is poisoned.

620
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,240
Everyone, be careful.

621
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,240
Be sure

622
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,200
not to end up like the Prince.
