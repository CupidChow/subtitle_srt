1
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,360
A little lower.

2
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:43,920
Me.

3
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,320
What's happening to me?

4
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,760
Bitten by a poisonous insect.

5
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,360
You can't scratch this.

6
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,480
It's all red here.

7
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,880
Then put on a thicker layer for me.

8
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,680
Lower your clothes a bit more.

9
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,400
A little lower.

10
00:01:59,480 --> 00:01:59,920
Okay.

11
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,640
Let me do it, let me.

12
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,600
Is that enough?

13
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,360
Is it enough now?

14
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,160
Brother Yu likes her so much.

15
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,560
She’s actually involved with the wicked fox.

16
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:08,880
But...

17
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,040
If I spread this around,

18
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,320
Brother Yu will be heartbroken,

19
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,680
and he'll lose face.

20
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,640
What should I do?

21
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,080
Why do I feel someone is outside the carriage?

22
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,360
I don't think so.

23
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,800
The princess is sleeping in the carriage next door.

24
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,320
I forgot about her.

25
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,680
Go on, go on.

26
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,400
Shameless couple.

27
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,360
If not for Brother Yu’s sake,

28
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,840
I’d have you cut into a thousand pieces.

29
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

30
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,960
How has Mother been eating lately?

31
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,040
The Empress Dowager still can't eat.

32
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,960
She just lit calming incense and went to sleep.

33
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,560
Your child greets Mother.

34
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,440
Lin’er.

35
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,800
Lin’er.

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,440
Come to Mother quickly.

37
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,560
Lin’er, is that you?

38
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,760
Your Majesty.

39
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,320
Your servant didn’t know it was Your Majesty.

40
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,960
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,440
Mother.

42
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,240
What’s wrong with you?

43
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,200
Your Majesty.

44
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,720
My family would never threaten the court.

45
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,840
Military officers won’t build private armies.

46
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,320
Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

47
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,600
Mother is mistaking me for Imperial Father.

48
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,600
Why is this happening?

49
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,440
Come.

50
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,200
I understand.

51
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,280
I failed to consider this before.

52
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,320
My Queen.

53
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,800
Don’t worry.

54
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,480
Really.

55
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:45,880
Really.

56
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,240
Your Majesty.

57
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,320
Mother has been restless and sleepless.

58
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,640
Is it related to her chronic migraines?

59
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,320
I...

60
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,120
I took the Empress Dowager’s pulse yesterday.

61
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,720
It was the same as usual.

62
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,800
I suspect

63
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,040
she caught a chill yesterday, that’s why.

64
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,480
If it’s just a chill,

65
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,360
why would Mother mistake me

66
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,960
for Imperial Father?

67
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,960
If that’s the case,

68
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,080
I believe

69
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,960
the Empress Dowager’s migraines have returned.

70
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,960
She’s developed hysteria from exhaustion.

71
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,320
You check her wellness pulse every day.

72
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,000
How did you not notice?

73
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,760
Mother’s condition has worsened.

74
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,800
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

75
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,360
Li Quan.

76
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,560
At your service.

77
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,280
Move my memorials here.

78
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,760
Yes.

79
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,760
Continue checking the Empress Dowager’s pulse.

80
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,760
Make sure she feels at ease.

81
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,040
Yes.

82
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,120
Madam.

83
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,320
How is it?

84
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,440
It’s fine now.

85
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,360
Much better.

86
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,840
Then let’s get ready to depart.

87
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,240
Okay.

88
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,200
Miss Nan.

89
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,120
I have something to tell you.

90
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,920
Come with me for a moment.

91
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:36,720
Princess.

92
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,120
We’re about to leave.

93
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,640
If you have something to say, say it in the carriage.

94
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,440
No, I have to say it now.

95
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,280
Then go ahead.

96
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,320
We need to get some things ready anyway.

97
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,800
Alright.

98
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,280
Miss Nan.

99
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,240
I already know about your situation.

100
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,080
What do you know?

101
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,160
Your secret.

102
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,080
I know everything.

103
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,440
Did you just overhear

104
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,320
what we were talking about?

105
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,120
Yes.

106
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,600
I didn’t expect you to be...

107
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,440
Forget it.

108
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,920
I can’t tell Brother Yu myself.

109
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,720
You should confess to him yourself.

110
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:21,840
Me...

111
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,200
Confess what?

112
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,400
She’s always known.

113
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:24,640
He...

114
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,400
He knows about you two.

115
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,640
What about us?

116
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,800
That’s just how it is.

117
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,720
Ask her if you don’t believe me.

118
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,200
The Rui Family has always been upright.

119
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,600
How could they allow you to do this?

120
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,840
What did we do?

121
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,400
You...

122
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,840
As Brother Yu’s wife,

123
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,040
you secretly got involved with the wicked fox.

124
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,640
He’s Brother Yu’s second brother.

125
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,240
What are you talking about?

126
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,120
Careful!

127
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,400
Careful!

128
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,320
You’re hurt.

129
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,840
Don’t mind me, go quickly!

130
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:00,640
Go!

131
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,680
Brother Yu!

132
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,440
Princess!

133
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,160
Brother Yu!

134
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,040
What’s wrong?

135
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,800
Brother Yu, there are bandits!

136
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,840
Miss Nan, she...

137
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,400
Chong Ming.

138
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:10,840
Yes.

139
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,000
Go!

140
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,000
Brother Yu!

141
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
What should we do?

142
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,640
It’s fine, Princess, it’s fine.

143
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,120
Search.

144
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,040
Check.

145
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,040
Are you alright?

146
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,320
Miss.

147
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,320
You’re hurt.

148
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,240
I’m fine.

149
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,320
Go!

150
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,240
Brother Yu is back.

151
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,600
Are you all right?

152
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,720
How did you get hurt so badly?

153
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,080
I'm fine.

154
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,800
Just a cut from a blade.

155
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,840
It didn't hit anything vital.

156
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,920
There's medicine in the carriage.

157
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,040
Darn it, let me bandage you.

158
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,520
Liang Jin.

159
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,440
Get the medicine.

160
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,640
Yes, sir.

161
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,040
Everyone, get ready to depart.

162
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,280
Yes.

163
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,520
Bring the horse over.

164
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,840
There's one more thing to handle.

165
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,680
What is it?

166
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,280
The princess thinks

167
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,440
I have feelings for Second Brother.

168
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,720
She wants me to confess to you.

169
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,480
See?

170
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,400
I told you there'd be a misunderstanding.

171
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,440
But you wouldn't listen.

172
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,880
Go get bandaged first.

173
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,080
I'll explain to the princess.

174
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,200
Explain?

175
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,800
Let me handle it—it's a man's job.

176
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,200
Princess.

177
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,040
I have a secret to tell you.

178
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,520
I know.

179
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,240
You want to say

180
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,720
the one you like

181
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,160
is actually Rui Er the Fox.

182
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,120
Me.

183
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,800
Right?

184
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,520
You—

185
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,640
I'm actually a man.

186
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,040
Sorry for letting you misunderstand so long.

187
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,040
I'm truly sorry.

188
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:47,920
You—

189
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,480
You're a man?

190
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,120
A man?

191
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,520
Then—

192
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,680
Then why did Royal Brother

193
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,800
grant you and Brother Yu a marriage?

194
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,840
How can two men be together?

195
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,400
Two men...

196
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:02,920
Your Majesty

197
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,440
wants to promote the Military Imperial Exam.

198
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,400
Restore the military officers.

199
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,240
Young Master Nan disguised himself

200
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,840
as a woman to avoid trouble.

201
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,640
Now he's of marrying age.

202
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,720
So I help him keep his identity secret.

203
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,440
Once civil and military tensions ease,

204
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,840
and the exam is implemented,

205
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,920
Young Master Nan

206
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,320
can reclaim his true identity.

207
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,080
And take command of the army again.

208
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,720
General of the Cloud Banner.

209
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,400
Pearl Princess.

210
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,360
Here they come.

211
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,000
It's getting late.

212
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,760
We should get back on the road.

213
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,600
I'll go get bandaged.

214
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,960
And change my clothes.

215
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,520
Young Master Nan.

216
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,840
Let's go.

217
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,200
Your Majesty.

218
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,120
I didn't expect, after all these years,

219
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,160
Mother still can't let go

220
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,920
of what happened back then.

221
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,080
Those who could talk

222
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,520
honestly with me have all gone away.

223
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,440
Qiao Youyi.

224
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,640
Qiao Youyi.

225
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,320
Where's that brat?

226
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,440
Qiao Youyi!

227
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,400
Why are you standing by the wall?

228
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,400
Aren't you afraid of getting hurt?

229
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,800
Aren't you doing the same?

230
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,160
Ignoring the main gate,

231
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,320
and climbing the wall instead.

232
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,480
Qiao Youyi.

233
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,960
I knew you'd be here.

234
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,320
My dad's coming—let's go!

235
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,000
Brother Yu, I'm sorry.

236
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,800
After you turned me down that day,

237
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,600
I figured things out.

238
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,280
I won't like you anymore.

239
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,760
A princess shouldn't

240
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,560
be fixated on someone like me.

241
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,880
I've decided.

242
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,960
From now on,

243
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,400
I'll like Young Master Nan.

244
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:02,560
Careful!

245
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,440
Brother Yu.

246
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,840
We grew up together,

247
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,600
but men and women are different.

248
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,000
We should keep some distance.

249
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,000
Yes.

250
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,400
Are you all okay?

251
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,560
Wicked fox, how are you driving?

252
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,560
Young Master Nan is driving.

253
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm just enjoying the breeze.

254
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,760
Young Master Nan,

255
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,560
Young Master Nan.

256
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,800
Are you tired?

257
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,680
If you're tired,

258
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,040
come inside and rest.

259
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,880
Let the wicked fox drive instead.

260
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,160
Thank you for your kindness, Princess.

261
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,360
I'm not tired.

262
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:32,600
Then—

263
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,840
I'll go out and keep you company.

264
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,840
You should rest in the carriage.

265
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:37,880
It's too sunny outside.

266
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,040
It's fine.

267
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,880
Princess.

268
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,000
Are you all right?

269
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,760
It hurts so much—I'm fine, really!

270
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,600
I'm fine, I'm fine.

271
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,960
I'm fine, I'm fine.

272
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,200
Don't worry about me.

273
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,760
Even driving, you're so witty.

274
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,560
Young Master Nan, come in if you're tired.

275
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,600
Why are you running?

276
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,600
My dad wants to drag me to another matchmaking.

277
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,040
Sorry about that.

278
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,640
It's fine.

279
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,320
Um...

280
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,760
By the way, are you married?

281
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:18,960
No.

282
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,360
No one at home urging you?

283
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,520
Well, they did urge me yesterday.

284
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,200
Looks like we're in the same boat.

285
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,440
You look quite good.

286
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,360
I bet you have plenty of matchmakers at home.

287
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,960
To be honest, Miss Qiao,

288
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,960
my mother has been seriously ill lately.

289
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,200
My marriage plans are on hold for now.

290
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,520
What illness does your mother have?

291
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,440
I'm not trying to pry.

292
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,760
I just know a few good doctors.

293
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,880
Maybe they could help you.

294
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,560
I'm not blaming you.

295
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,640
I just don't know how to describe it.

296
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,560
My mother

297
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,960
went through some things in the past.

298
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,800
She was deeply affected back then.

299
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,560
She developed some lingering illnesses.

300
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,640
She's been resting ever since.

301
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,640
Last night, she suddenly had hysteria.

302
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,960
She mistook me for my father.

303
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,800
The doctor gave her a few acupuncture needles.

304
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,160
That finally calmed her down.

305
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,040
Hysteria?

306
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,720
Does she also get migraines?

307
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,160
She gets headaches if she catches a chill.

308
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:12,960
Well...

309
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,400
It's been like that for as long as I remember.

310
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,520
That's the same as the General's wife.

311
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,960
Could you spare half a month?

312
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,960
I can give it a try.

313
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,560
Meet me tomorrow at dawn.

314
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,760
I'll take you up the mountain to gather herbs.

315
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,560
Gather herbs?

316
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,040
I'll go prepare what we need for tomorrow.

317
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,280
See you at dawn tomorrow.

318
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,800
See you tomorrow.

319
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,720
Even though we've headed south,

320
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,920
it's still chilly.

321
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,680
Don't catch a cold.

322
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,960
My grilled fish is delicious too.

323
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,080
Try some.

324
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,520
Young Master Nan,

325
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,040
how do you know how to grill fish?

326
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,000
It smells so good!

327
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,880
I was raised as a military officer.

328
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,480
I caught fish in the river as a child.

329
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,880
Climbed trees for bird eggs.

330
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,200
I did all sorts of rough things.

331
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,480
Princess, you shouldn't do such things.

332
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,200
You're amazing.

333
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,560
Can you teach me?

334
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,240
I've loved catching fish since I was little.

335
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,120
And

336
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,360
I'm also skilled at cooking.

337
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,600
Then catch two more fish tomorrow.

338
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,800
I'll cook them for you.

339
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,000
Rui Yu,

340
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,000
Eat up.

341
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,200
It won't taste good if it gets cold.

342
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,080
Better save it for the Princess.

343
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,000
You and Brother Yu are both men.

344
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,880
Pretending to be a couple in the capital was one thing.

345
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,680
But now everyone knows the truth.

346
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,480
No need to keep acting, right?

347
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,360
Alright.

348
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,840
We'll be careful.

349
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,080
What are we acting?

350
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,680
Can't I just be nice to Rui Yu?

351
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,040
Princess, that's not what he meant.

352
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,600
Look at you.

353
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,680
It's already at your mouth.

354
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,680
Nan Chenxiao, I'm a princess, you know!

355
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,560
Say it louder,

356
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,200
and you'll call the bandits over.

357
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,080
Even if you're the king, it won't help.

358
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,440
So what if bandits come?

359
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,040
Aren't you all here to protect me?

360
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,760
Yes, we're all here to protect you.

361
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,960
But if you get us all killed,

362
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,200
the road to Pingxiang

363
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,880
we won't live to escort you.

364
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:29,840
Princess,

365
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:30,840
have some water.

366
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,800
Who wants your lousy fish?

367
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,800
Eat it yourself.

368
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,280
Princess.

369
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,880
Princess.

370
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,360
Princess.

371
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,600
Don't mind her.

372
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,080
Running out like that—

373
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,800
What if something happens?

374
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,600
Didn't Second Brother go after her?

375
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:49,880
It's fine.

376
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,200
Chong Ming,

377
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,080
where's the Princess?

378
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,480
Sorry.

379
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,840
I was too impulsive just now.

380
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,800
But I just

381
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,840
couldn't stand what she was saying.

382
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,160
I know.

383
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,800
No need to apologize.

384
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,560
It's just—

385
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,240
We must be careful on this journey.

386
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,360
We can't afford any mistakes.

387
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,280
I'll be careful.

388
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,280
Eat while it's hot.

389
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,400
Better save it for the Princess.

390
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,440
She doesn't need this.

391
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,440
Eat up.

392
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,360
Me

393
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,280
I'm not actually throwing a tantrum.

394
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,880
I'm just a little sad, that's all.

395
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,880
I know.

396
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,480
wicked fox

397
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,600
Do you think I'm

398
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,360
a really unfit princess?

399
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,920
Then what do you think a proper princess

400
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,920
should be like?

401
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:05,880
Literature

402
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,680
I can only read and write.

403
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,320
I read some storybooks.

404
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,760
I can't write those romantic poems.

405
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,080
I'm not as cultured as Wanwan.

406
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,680
Martial arts

407
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,680
I know even less about that.

408
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,480
I always trouble my royal brother.

409
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,040
I feel like I'm useless.

410
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,680
Who says so?

411
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,080
Rumor has it, the common folk all say

412
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,520
that Princess Chunxi

413
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,280
is both talented and beautiful,

414
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,280
graceful and intelligent,

415
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,520
ethereal beauty.

416
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:36,960
This...

417
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,480
Are they really talking about me?

418
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,400
Actually, everyone knows princesses

419
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,000
only from storybooks.

420
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,000
Just like you,

421
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,440
learn about the people from reading stories.

422
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,080
You've snuck out of the palace a few times.

423
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:49,880
How do you find the outside world

424
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,440
compared to what you imagined?

425
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,120
The outside world...

426
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,920
I always thought life outside would be more fun,

427
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,720
more exciting.

428
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,960
But under the Royal Capital,

429
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,960
danger lurks everywhere.

430
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,960
But this time, we've gone farther.

431
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,880
It's just like the storybooks say,

432
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,760
the scenery is beautiful and pleasant.

433
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,120
So you see,

434
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,560
good and evil always coexist.

435
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,960
Fortune and misfortune are neighbors.

436
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,120
Everything in this world

437
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,680
has two sides.

438
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,040
But I think

439
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,640
what people say isn't wrong.

440
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,560
Princess Chunxi

441
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,520
is truly graceful and intelligent.

442
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,680
And as for ethereal beauty,

443
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,760
it's not half as dazzling as yours.

444
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,040
This is for you.

445
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,920
What is it?

446
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,920
It's not some ancient rare book, is it?

447
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,520
I can't get through those.

448
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,080
It's Wang Guanshan's new book.

449
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,080
How did you get it?

450
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,200
I...

451
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:54,960
have my ways.

452
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,360
I know Wang Guanshan.

453
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,680
When we return to the capital,

454
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,880
can you take me to meet him?

455
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,680
I love his storybooks the most.

456
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,600
Sure, sure.

457
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,120
As long as we get back safely,

458
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,240
I'll take you to meet him.

459
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,880
Really? That's wonderful!

460
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,920
What's this new book about?

461
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,200
It's about

462
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,560
a stunningly beautiful lady,

463
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,040
and a mediocre scholar

464
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,480
wandering the world together.

465
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,440
Lady?

466
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,520
Why is she a lady,

467
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,280
not a princess?

468
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,240
Why a scholar,

469
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,920
didn't he write about generals before?

470
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,720
Why don't you write to Wang Guanshan

471
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,520
and tell him

472
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,040
a princess shouldn't be with a scholar,

473
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,960
she should be with a general.

474
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,280
Why do you have so many questions?

475
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,080
If you won't read it, give it back.

476
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,960
It's a new book, after all.

477
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,640
You've got it now.

478
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,880
Why wouldn't you read it?

479
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,560
I can't see clearly.

480
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,880
Didn't you already read it?

481
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,080
Tell me the story.

482
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,240
It's too long.

483
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,480
Let's head back first.

484
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,240
You can read it slowly tomorrow.

485
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,680
Me...

486
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,120
I just snuck out, now I'm going back?

487
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,840
That's so embarrassing.

488
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,120
Stay with me a little longer.

489
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,080
When we go back, just say

490
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,800
you begged and pleaded

491
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,960
to get me to return.

492
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,040
Alright.

493
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,080
Just tell me the story.

494
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,320
Tell it well.

495
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,160
Legend says, in the distant Kingdom of Luoya,

496
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,840
there was a beautiful lady.

497
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,720
Princess!

498
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,520
Alright, alright, princess, princess.

499
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,480
Legend says, in the distant Kingdom of Luoya,

500
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,680
there was a beautiful princess.

501
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,040
The princess was lively and kind.

502
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,400
The whole kingdom saw her birth

503
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,320
as a heavenly blessing.

504
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,240
This time, he gave me command of the Chongming Guard.

505
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,680
I feel I'm one step closer to regaining my true identity.

506
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,280
Soon, I can join the army

507
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,440
as a man.

508
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,080
And serve my country.

509
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,400
He can return to being a man,

510
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,080
but I can only be the Third Young Master of the Rui Family.

511
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,040
Even if we try to be husband and wife,

512
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,200
it's only within the Rui Residence.

513
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,080
One day, we'll have to part.

514
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:08,880
Princess.

515
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,400
I ate too much.

516
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,560
I want to go for a walk.

517
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,240
You all go do your own thing.

518
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,800
You should all get some rest early.

519
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,400
We have to travel again tomorrow.

520
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,040
What's wrong with your throat?

521
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,040
It's nothing, just from talking too much.

522
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,560
Princess.

523
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,200
Princess, you'll have to put up with
tonight's arrangements.

524
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:33,880
Sleep on a straw mat.

525
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,200
Once we reach the post station tomorrow,

526
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,600
we'll be able to sleep better.

527
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:36,920
Uh...

528
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,800
I'm so far away from you all.

529
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,680
The three of us are all men.

530
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,080
So...

531
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,480
But you're here to protect me.

532
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,200
If I'm so far from you,

533
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,560
what if something happens?

534
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,840
So, Princess, you mean...

535
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,160
Like this?

536
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,880
Young Master Nan knows martial arts.

537
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,080
Then Young Master Nan should

538
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,600
sleep by the door.

539
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:03,800
I...

540
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,760
Brother Yu sleeps on this side.

541
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,280
Wicked fox sleeps on this side.

542
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,240
I'll sleep in the middle.

543
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,560
How about that, everyone?

544
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,440
You...

545
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,400
Let's do as the Princess says.

546
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,400
It's getting late.

547
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,480
You all should rest early too.

548
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,760
We'll go to sleep first.

549
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,680
It's cold at night, you sleep by the door.

550
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,800
If it's too cold, use more covers.

551
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,040
Don't catch a chill.

552
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,160
I'm tough, don't worry.

553
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,200
You can sleep soundly.

554
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,680
I'll guard the door, nothing will happen.

555
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,400
You're still injured.

556
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,400
Don't try to act tough.

557
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,200
It's just a minor wound.

558
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,000
It's fine.

559
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,360
Go to sleep now.

560
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,160
Are you two going to sleep or not?

561
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,400
Yes, sleeping.

562
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,080
Let's sleep, let's sleep.

563
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:53,840
Young Master Lin.

564
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,160
Miss Qiao.

565
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,520
You're up so early.

566
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,160
It's not the agreed time yet.

567
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,320
Miss Qiao helped me so much.

568
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,720
How could I let you wait for me?

569
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,720
What is this?

570
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,160
These are some things I prepared.

571
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,040
We'll need them for going up the mountain.

572
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,360
Let me see.

573
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,600
This is...

574
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,320
Pastries.

575
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,160
Water flask.

576
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,400
Dagger.

577
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,040
What are these for?

578
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,600
We usually have to spend the night
when we go up the mountain.

579
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,320
We'll reach the forest before dark.

580
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,160
We won't need to stay overnight.

581
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,600
Keep the pastries to snack on
along the way.

582
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,960
You can take the dagger and water flask.

583
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,960
I have better insect repellent.

584
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,760
As for this mat,

585
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,640
I guess you haven't suffered much.

586
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,960
Keep it for resting on the road.

587
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,200
This mat is specially prepared
for Miss Qiao.

588
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,560
If you think it's a burden,

589
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,000
you don't have to bring it.

590
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,760
I've gone up the mountain
to gather herbs with my master
since I was little.

591
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,400
I'm long used to mountain life.

592
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,520
But...

593
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,320
Thank you for doing so much for me.

594
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,360
Let's go, let's head up the mountain.

595
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,640
Alright.

596
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,600
It's so peaceful in the mountains.

597
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,720
Yes, it is.

598
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,280
Brother Chenxiao, it's time to go.

599
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,560
Where's Rui Yu?

600
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,520
Why do you always look for Brother Yu first?

601
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,560
We're at least a couple in name.

602
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,360
For anything,

603
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,960
we should at least talk to each other.

604
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,960
But we're not in the capital now.

605
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,640
I thought about it all night yesterday.

606
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,840
Don't you want to restore your status?

607
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,960
Be my Princess Consort.

608
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,760
With me protecting you,

609
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,840
no one would dare say a word against you.

610
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,200
I don't want to be Princess Consort.

611
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,760
I'm not worthy.

612
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,040
I don't mind at all.

613
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,240
Why should you care?

614
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,360
When we return from Pingxiang,

615
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,040
I'll talk to my royal brother.

616
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,200
He only granted the marriage
to protect you anyway.

617
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,800
This works out well.

618
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,560
Everyone will be happy.

619
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:29,840
Princess.

620
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,640
Are you really so carefree?

621
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,440
I was so rude to you last night.

622
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,560
And you still put up with it.

623
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,360
I was a bit willful last night.

624
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,360
Right, can't you be gentle
like others?

625
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,440
Be a little kinder to me?

626
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,280
I want to.

627
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:56,720
None of your business.

628
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,400
You...

629
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,440
Forget it.

630
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,960
Military officers are all like this.

631
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,320
General of the Cloud Banner is the same.

632
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,200
Don't get angry.

633
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,200
You mustn't get angry.

634
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,360
You need a Princess's tolerance.

635
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,840
You're up.

636
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,400
Why didn't you call me?

637
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,600
You were hurt yesterday.

638
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,600
The medicine I gave you
helps you relax.

639
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,120
A straw mat is more comfortable
than a carriage.

640
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,240
Sleep as much as you can.

641
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,520
Sir.

642
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,240
Wipe it off.

643
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,520
We'll set out soon.

644
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,160
Brother Chenxiao.

645
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,040
Let me wipe it for you.

646
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,040
No, no, no.

647
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,160
I'll do it myself.

648
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,040
Let me wipe it for you.

649
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,120
I'm not wiping anymore.

650
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,120
Princess, suit yourself.

651
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,160
Nan Chenxiao.

652
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,320
I'm a dignified Princess,
can't I do this?
