1
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,440
There are two forks ahead.

2
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,840
One leads to Suzhou.

3
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,240
Last time, Your Excellency took this route.

4
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,720
Though the road is a bit winding,

5
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,720
it’s mostly main roads.

6
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,200
The other leads to Jingzhou.

7
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,880
We could exit via Jingzhou today.

8
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,000
But the side roads are more winding.

9
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,280
Young Master,

10
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,400
in my experience,

11
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,400
entering through Suzhou is better.

12
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,360
Last time I returned to Ling An,

13
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,320
I found a road

14
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,560
that’s not on the map.

15
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,320
Go ask Yu’er about it later.

16
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,880
If she agrees,

17
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,120
I’ll lead the way.

18
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,200
Yes.

19
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,040
Madam—

20
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,880
Oh, no, Young Master Nan.

21
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,040
You—

22
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,120
You called me that so suddenly,

23
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,520
it feels a bit awkward.

24
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,320
Then I’ll—

25
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,560
You may leave now.

26
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,480
Yes, Your Excellency.

27
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,800
Are you upset?

28
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,240
No.

29
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,040
There’s nothing between me
and that little princess.

30
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,360
Really, nothing at all.

31
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,960
I know.

32
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,600
I’m just a bit tired.

33
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,320
Don’t overthink it.

34
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,080
I’m glad you care
about my feelings.

35
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,120
It makes me happy.

36
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,160
Then I should definitely—

37
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,520
Your subordinate has a report.

38
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,240
What is it?

39
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,720
We planned to take
the previous route.

40
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,080
But Second Young Master Rui said

41
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,240
he knows a side road

42
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,560
and suggests we exit
via Suzhou this time.

43
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,840
Second Brother is more familiar
with travel between the two states.

44
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,080
He knows it better.

45
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,760
If he’s more confident,

46
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,080
let him lead the way.

47
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,560
Is everything packed?

48
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,720
We’re ready to depart anytime.

49
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,080
Then we’ll leave in a moment.

50
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:29,880
Yes.

51
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,120
Gather up!

52
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,520
Route change!

53
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,840
We’ll travel side roads
through Suzhou.

54
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,480
Chongming Guard, stand by.

55
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,680
Guard the carriage at all times.

56
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,440
No mistakes allowed.

57
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,280
Is that clear?

58
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,240
Understood!

59
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,720
You’re up early today.

60
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,120
I don’t want to go
to Pingxiang anymore.

61
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,960
Take me back.

62
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,320
Sure.

63
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,080
I mean, I want
to return to Ling An.

64
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,920
I heard you.

65
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,320
If you want to go back,
we’ll go back.

66
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,000
You—

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,040
You don’t object?

68
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,120
You’re a princess.

69
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,680
As long as you cover for us,

70
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,480
whatever you order,

71
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,560
we’ll just do it.

72
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,720
Alright.

73
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,720
Then go tell them now.

74
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,560
Send me back.

75
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,760
I’m just a commoner.

76
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,880
I can’t order those big shots around.

77
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,640
Princess, you’d better
tell Yu’er yourself.

78
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,360
Just tell her you want
to return to Ling An.

79
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,960
And want a marriage alliance
with Qian Yuan.

80
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,480
You’re Your Majesty’s
own sister anyway.

81
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,280
Your Majesty will
find a way for you.

82
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,880
If this doesn’t work,

83
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,480
we’ll think of a second
or third plan.

84
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,680
Someone will always
find a way for you.

85
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:35,720
I—

86
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,640
I’m not as willful
as you say.

87
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,360
Alright.

88
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,560
I was just impulsive earlier.

89
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,640
Can’t you comfort me a little?

90
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,560
Princess,

91
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,800
Liking someone is your own business.

92
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,400
But you can’t expect
the same in return.

93
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,880
Of course.

94
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,400
If you want to use your title
to force marriage,

95
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,960
then forget what I said.

96
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,040
But you don’t seem
the type to do that.

97
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,480
Otherwise,

98
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,600
you wouldn’t have chased
Yu’er for so many years.

99
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,680
You talk like you know me well.

100
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,360
Aren’t all princesses
in storybooks like this?

101
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,280
Beautiful and kind-hearted,

102
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,200
just sharp-tongued.

103
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,080
So what should I do

104
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,760
for them to like me?

105
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,720
Why do you have to become

106
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,960
what they like?

107
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,800
Someone will like
the real you.

108
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,200
Who is it?

109
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,000
Maybe they haven’t
shown up yet.

110
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,800
But believe that
such a person exists.

111
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,960
He’ll like you,

112
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,400
respect you, understand you,

113
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,600
and accept everything about you.

114
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,600
And you’ll do the same
because you like him.

115
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,560
You’ll do all that for him.

116
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,640
Because of love,

117
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,680
you’ll respect, accept,
and understand him.

118
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,280
I don’t fully understand,

119
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,680
but I’ll try.

120
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,360
Thank you for telling me this.

121
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,440
Let’s go, it’s time to leave.

122
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,560
Master

123
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,200
Master

124
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,680
Master

125
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,840
Pretending not to hear again

126
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,120
Master

127
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,320
I'm here

128
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,480
You scared me to death

129
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,240
I'm fishing

130
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,440
Don't scare the fish away

131
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,040
You didn't even bait the hook

132
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,440
You won't catch anything even if I don't call you

133
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,600
This is called "the willing fish bites"

134
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,960
Whether it bites or not

135
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,760
It's up to the fish

136
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,480
Come on

137
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,480
There aren't any fish in this pond

138
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,120
You're just mooching off the old man's fish

139
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,760
Master

140
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,760
Can you stop fishing for now

141
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,520
What for

142
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,880
I brought a friend

143
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,680
I want you to write a prescription for him

144
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,400
His mother's illness is similar to Lady Nan's

145
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,440
I hope you can prescribe something

146
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,120
She's not here

147
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,600
I haven't checked her pulse

148
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,640
How can I prescribe anything

149
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,120
His mother is sick and can't come

150
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,600
Didn't I describe Lady Nan's pulse to you too

151
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,680
Just let him describe it

152
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,360
I'm fishing

153
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,400
Seriously

154
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,880
Do you want grilled fish

155
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,080
Sure

156
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,600
I'll borrow some fish from next door

157
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,520
Wait for me

158
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,240
Greetings, sir

159
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,160
Young friend

160
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,040
Came uninvited

161
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,120
That's not very polite

162
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,040
I didn't mean to intrude

163
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,520
My mother's illness is urgent

164
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,400
I hope you can forgive me

165
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,680
What's your mother's name

166
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,880
I never treat those without a name

167
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,880
I can't reveal her name right now

168
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,520
If you can't say

169
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,880
Then I can't treat her

170
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:57,800
Sir

171
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,400
Please, sir

172
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,800
I hope you'll reconsider

173
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,240
We'll reach Suzhou soon

174
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,400
How much longer to pass the checkpoint

175
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,840
If we don't rest

176
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,280
We'll reach Pingxiang before dark

177
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,080
Princess

178
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,080
Should we rest in Suzhou tonight

179
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,360
I'm not tired

180
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,520
Brother Chenxiao and the others are the ones working hard

181
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,680
Brother Chenxiao

182
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,360
Should we stay in Suzhou tonight

183
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,680
Let's head to Pingxiang as soon as possible

184
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,800
Once we're there

185
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,120
We can stay at the post station

186
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,000
Is that okay, Yu'er

187
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:13,680
I'm fine with anything

188
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,280
Alright

189
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,520
Let's do as Brother Chenxiao says

190
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,280
Let's keep going

191
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,720
Still haven't caught any, right

192
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,800
The old man next door caught lots of yellow croaker

193
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,960
We can have fried fish for lunch today

194
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,840
What's wrong

195
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,000
Seems like it went wrong

196
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,000
The old man wouldn't give you a prescription, huh

197
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,040
It's fine

198
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,800
Let's just treat this as a trip to relax

199
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,240
I'll help you eat all his food later

200
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,160
And drink all his wine

201
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,520
No

202
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,840
I was too rash

203
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:25,800
You

204
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,120
You can't catch any fish anyway

205
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,040
Why not help me tidy up the kitchen

206
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,280
And prepare some side dishes

207
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,920
You annoy your master like this

208
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,160
He won't get mad, will he

209
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,600
My master is just stubborn

210
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,920
That's why I told you

211
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,520
You need at least half a month

212
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,840
Who knows when he'll change his mind

213
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,720
And refuse to treat you

214
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,360
Stay with me for a while

215
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,040
Spend more time here

216
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,280
He'll calm down eventually

217
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,840
You're right

218
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,360
Sincerity works wonders

219
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,480
Let's catch a few more fish by the river

220
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,520
And pick some vegetables too

221
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,520
Okay

222
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,600
Should we add another layer

223
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,720
Brother Chenxiao

224
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,720
Let's go out and play

225
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,280
Alright

226
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,840
I'm a bit tired today

227
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,800
Let Second Brother go instead

228
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,360
Enough

229
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,480
Can't you see the two brothers have things to discuss

230
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,000
Let's go

231
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,160
I'll go play with you

232
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,720
What do you need to discuss

233
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,160
Is there something you can't tell me

234
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,480
Princess, lately

235
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,720
Don't call Chenxiao by name for now

236
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,840
There are too many eyes in Pingxiang

237
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,280
We should be careful

238
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,160
Then what should I call him

239
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,600
He's the head guard now

240
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,600
You all

241
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,120
Shouldn't get too close either

242
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,680
Alright

243
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,840
For the head guard's safety

244
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,840
I'll be careful

245
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,320
Wicked fox

246
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,680
Do you know how to play cuju

247
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:19,960
Just for fun

248
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,280
Fishing and cuju

249
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,720
If it's for amusement

250
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,040
There's nothing I can't do

251
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:24,480
Let's go

252
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,600
Teach me cuju

253
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,160
There are people watching us everywhere now

254
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:31,840
So

255
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,480
Let's play this instead

256
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:34,840
Take this

257
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,920
What is this

258
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,400
Can you eat this

259
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,240
No, no, that's not for eating

260
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,040
I'll make it for you

261
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,600
Watch closely

262
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,480
Take it

263
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,840
Master, why are you like this

264
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,360
I caught a few more fish for you

265
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,480
I'll stew them for you at lunch, isn't that enough

266
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,840
Give me back my fishing rod

267
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,280
Go wherever you want

268
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:14,600
You

269
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,680
Miss Qiao, you're climbing the wall again

270
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,600
You think this little thing can stop me

271
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,960
Not using the main entrance,

272
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,680
must mean you're all thieves.

273
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,400
Sorry to trouble you, sir.

274
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,840
You know it's a bother, yet you still come?

275
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:01,680
Go, go, go.

276
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,680
You've been tired all day.

277
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,480
Take a break first.

278
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,720
Who let you in here?

279
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,840
You can't stay here.

280
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,400
There's a side room my father and I built.

281
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:14,960
He'll stay there.

282
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,920
We don't need your permission.

283
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,360
Doesn't matter who built it.

284
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,680
You simply can't live here.

285
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,720
Then go talk to my father.

286
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:24,920
Fine.

287
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:25,840
Alright.

288
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,240
You're here.

289
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,360
I'm leaving.

290
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,760
Sir.

291
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,760
Let's go try to persuade him.

292
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,960
Well, this—

293
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,360
depends on how you do.

294
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,440
On me?

295
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,720
My beloved disciple drove him away.

296
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,360
You, an outsider, coaxed him back.

297
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,000
Compared side by side,

298
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,840
he'll think you're actually decent.

299
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,560
Maybe,

300
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,200
he'll agree to treat your mother.

301
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,480
So it's for me.

302
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,600
Not entirely.

303
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,360
The old man can be infuriating.

304
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,720
I just can't help but snap back.

305
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,480
Miss Qiao, please tell me

306
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,240
about your master—

307
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,480
his temperament and interests.

308
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,080
My master,

309
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,440
claims to be free of desires.

310
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,720
But he's actually a foodie.

311
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,720
He also tinkers with decorations.

312
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,680
The waterwheel and fences out back—

313
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,600
he built them all.

314
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,360
It's amazing.

315
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,600
I'll show you tomorrow.

316
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,360
Sounds

317
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,600
quite interesting.

318
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,440
Come.

319
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,320
Let me help you.

320
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,600
Okay.

321
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,160
Before coming this time,

322
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,240
Second Brother gave me news.

323
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,160
Qian Yuan wants to increase

324
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,640
grain trade with Pingxiang.

325
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,040
The amount

326
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,360
matches Ling An's.

327
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,640
They're trying to break

328
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,680
the Pingxiang-Ling An alliance.

329
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,680
This trip

330
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,280
is supposedly to escort Princess Yan Luo in her escape.

331
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,920
But in truth, Your Majesty

332
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,880
gave me an order.

333
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,480
I've been thinking

334
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,480
how to break this situation.

335
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,280
But I couldn't find a good solution.

336
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,680
Until I actually arrived in Pingxiang.

337
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,480
Then I had an idea.

338
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,240
Just—

339
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:15,920
go.

340
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,640
As long as it stays balanced,

341
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,160
it keeps spinning on its own.

342
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:25,920
So what is it?

343
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,640
I can do it too.

344
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,360
See?

345
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,400
I want to meet the Prince of Pingxiang

346
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,800
and form a new alliance.

347
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,520
Wicked fox, you're so clever!

348
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,920
Hou Qi will surely interfere.

349
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,520
So we need a way

350
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,160
to bypass the powerful Regent.

351
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,000
Send word to Hou Xian.

352
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,920
You've got a plan?

353
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,040
Didn't I bring a capable person?

354
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,480
Tomorrow,

355
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,160
we'll see the results.

356
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,920
Master Yu.

357
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:17,920
Master Yu.

358
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,800
has run into some trouble.

359
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,400
Water.

360
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,640
The waterwheel seems

361
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:22,800
broken.

362
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,280
I know a little

363
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,160
about Mechanical Arts.

364
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,160
May I give it a try?

365
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,680
If I break it,

366
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,920
I'll get you a new one.

367
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,000
It's broken anyway.

368
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,120
Go ahead and try.

369
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:46,760
Alright.

370
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,320
Looks like

371
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,840
it's working again.

372
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,400
What's your name?

373
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,680
My surname is Lin.

374
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,520
I'm Lin Yan.

375
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,920
Lin Yan.

376
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,400
Where do you work?

377
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,640
I'm at

378
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,040
the Hanlin Academy as an Academician Lecturer.

379
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,120
Academician Lecturer.

380
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,360
Fourth rank.

381
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,160
Yes.

382
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,520
Not a high position.

383
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,680
Civil and military officials rarely get along here.

384
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,520
How did you meet Youyi?

385
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,160
Your Majesty appointed Rui Yu as Second Rank Academician.

386
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,120
and Nan Chenxiao.

387
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,160
I want to know

388
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,560
about you and Youyi.

389
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,160
Rui Yu and I are good friends.

390
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,800
By chance,

391
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,240
I met Miss Qiao.

392
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,560
You have three days.

393
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,440
Okay.

394
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,080
Memorize all the herbs listed here.

395
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,640
Thank you, sir.

396
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:58,960
Master.

397
00:20:59,120 --> 00:20:59,960
The meal is ready.

398
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,840
Where are you going?

399
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,720
There's good wine—want some?

400
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,600
How is it?

401
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,240
Master gave me three days

402
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,360
to learn this herbal book.

403
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,880
Then there's hope.

404
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,520
Don't worry.

405
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,400
I'll help you.

406
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,120
Are you done yet?

407
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,640
Talk, talk, talk.

408
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,400
I'm starving.

409
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,640
Are you eating or not?

410
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,160
Eat, eat—coming, Master!

411
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,400
And there's good food and wine.

412
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,200
Prince

413
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,160
His Majesty watched a performance today

414
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,440
then went back to read

415
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,760
performance

416
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:54,600
Yes

417
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,040
The Prince invites performers to the palace
every month

418
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,240
Any unusual activity?

419
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,320
Nothing unusual so far

420
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,760
What about Rui Yu and the others?

421
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,560
They returned at dusk

422
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,680
and went to rest in their rooms

423
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,520
Seems they were tired from traveling

424
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,840
Go check if they're awake

425
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,480
I want to meet them myself

426
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,560
Yes, Prince

427
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,720
Who is it?

428
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
It's me

429
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,760
I have something to tell you

430
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,720
Can I talk to you for a moment?

431
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,760
It's getting late

432
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,520
If the Princess has something to say

433
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,160
let's talk tomorrow

434
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,520
I want to say it now

435
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,680
Give me fifteen minutes

436
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,440
I want to ask you

437
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,080
Since you're a general

438
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,320
and I'm a princess

439
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,440
how could you not like me?

440
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,000
Princess, do you think

441
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,200
what does it mean to like someone?

442
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,280
To like

443
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,600
is being happy to see someone

444
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,000
wanting to talk to them

445
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,080
wanting to tell them everything

446
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,720
That's all the storybooks say

447
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,000
So your liking for me

448
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,560
is just because the storybook wrote

449
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,760
a tale of a general and a princess

450
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,760
If the storybook wrote

451
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,160
the princess marries for alliance

452
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,840
and weds a prince far away

453
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,960
would you agree to that too?

454
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,080
Marrying a prince far away

455
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,040
Your feelings for Rui Yu were the same

456
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,960
What you call liking isn't real

457
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,560
It's just someone's imagination

458
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,840
built for you

459
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,200
I

460
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,600
I don't like just anyone

461
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,960
You and Brother Yu are people I know well

462
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,280
Because I understand you both

463
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,320
What do you know about us?

464
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,000
Do you know what I like to eat

465
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,040
or what I enjoy doing?

466
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,200
Do you know what books Rui Yu likes?

467
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,080
With some time

468
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,600
I'll find out sooner or later

469
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,600
I know the Princess is pure-hearted

470
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,480
and kind

471
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,840
To be liked by the Princess

472
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,200
is a blessing for me

473
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:12,960
But

474
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,560
I already like someone

475
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,920
Could it be

476
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,480
the person I'm thinking of?

477
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,000
I don't know who you're thinking of

478
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,520
Anyway, Princess

479
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,040
I don't like you

480
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,720
And your feelings for us

481
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,000
are just imagined

482
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,760
When you can move beyond storybooks

483
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,520
and truly like someone

484
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,520
that will show your true heart

485
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,760
Beyond storybooks

486
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,960
Your Excellency Rui

487
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,320
Your Excellency Rui

488
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,720
The Regent has summoned all officials

489
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,000
to the palace for discussion

490
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,040
I was ordered to invite you

491
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,960
to meet His Majesty tomorrow

492
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,840
Your Excellency Rui

493
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,520
I will meet you myself

494
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,240
Prince

495
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,280
Thank you for your care, Prince Hou

496
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,360
The Princess and I visited Pingxiang

497
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,560
Of course, we must meet the Prince of Pingxiang

498
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,440
Please return with the decree

499
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Yes, Your Excellency

500
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,840
Then, Your Excellency Rui

501
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,040
see you at court tomorrow

502
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,320
This Hou Qi

503
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,840
What is he plotting?

504
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,760
I'll go to the palace with you tomorrow

505
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,080
Drink!

506
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,080
If you won't drink, I will

507
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:52,960
Princess

508
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,080
Stop drinking

509
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,200
We're done drinking

510
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,240
Leave me alone

511
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,240
Drinking

512
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,360
You can't drink but you drank so much

513
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,160
Princess

514
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,280
Aren't you asking for trouble?

515
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,720
Then you drink

516
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,760
We're not drinking anymore

517
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,560
Change and go to sleep, okay?

518
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,520
The Princess is quite drunk

519
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,720
Should we get a maid to look after her?

520
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,280
What's wrong with liking storybooks?

521
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,720
Is it wrong to want to like someone?

522
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,760
None of you like me

523
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,080
There are still many who like you

524
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,200
No one likes me

525
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:31,680
Princess

526
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,360
Princess

527
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,760
Brother Yu doesn't like me

528
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,520
Let's not make a fuss

529
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,200
You don't like me either

530
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,240
Princess

531
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,240
Let's stop now

532
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:38,760
Give it back

533
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,280
No more fuss

534
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:40,440
No more fuss

535
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,680
Should I get you some medicine?

536
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,600
Princess, let's stop now

537
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,000
No more fuss, no more fuss

538
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,440
Come, lie down

539
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:47,720
Alright, alright

540
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,680
I want to drink more

541
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,280
Go to sleep, go to sleep

542
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,440
There are heavy guards outside

543
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,760
They're watching us

544
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,480
Are you confident about this?

545
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,000
Can you get me to see Hou Xian?

546
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,920
Trust me, I’ll handle it.

547
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,800
The token has been delivered to the palace.

548
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:09,680
Tomorrow,

549
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,840
we’ll know the outcome.

550
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,760
Go home and get a good night's sleep.

551
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,720
Tomorrow

552
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,000
will be another tough battle.

553
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,200
I’ll stand guard by your side with my sword.

554
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,520
Nothing will happen to you.

555
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,080
Imperatae Rhizoma

556
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,920
Leaf sheaths cluster at the stem base.

557
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,920
Stem leaves are narrow and linear.

558
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,200
The base has soft hairs.

559
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,600
Lower part narrows and hardens.

560
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,480
Tip tapers to a sharp point.

561
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,480
Wash and moisten slightly.

562
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,240
Cut and dry.

563
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,760
Remove debris to make Imperatae Rhizoma.

564
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,760
Stops vomiting and nosebleeds.

565
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,160
For typhoid and retching.

566
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,520
Relieves lung heat and shortness of breath.

567
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,800
Treats edema and jaundice.

568
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,920
Detoxifies alcohol poisoning.

569
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,600
The sun was harsh today, you must be thirsty.

570
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:19,920
Thank you.

571
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,200
Take a break.

572
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,760
Aunt Wang gave me two eels today.

573
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,600
You’ve worked hard gathering herbs these days.

574
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,600
Let me make something nourishing for you.

575
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,720
Before Master Yu went up the mountain,

576
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,520
what did he do?

577
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,680
I heard from Uncle Nan

578
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,840
my master was a strategist for the late emperor.

579
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,320
But he wasn’t sociable.

580
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,200
So few in the army knew him.

581
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,840
Later,

582
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,240
the generals suffered disaster.

583
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,600
He went up the mountain to avoid trouble.

584
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,160
He never came down again.

585
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,520
Between her and me,

586
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,560
there’s always this barrier.

587
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,760
It can’t be crossed.

588
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,240
After Rui Yu married Nan Chenxiao,

589
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,720
it seemed to help civil and military harmony.

590
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,320
It seems to have had some effect.

591
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,760
Maybe.

592
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Anyway, I think no civil official is good.

593
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,560
Your Majesty

594
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,760
must be just like his father,

595
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,160
full of scheming thoughts.

596
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,720
Always fearing generals will seize power.

597
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,760
What if he thinks differently than you?

598
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,240
What if he wants to improve civil-military ties?

599
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,920
If he truly wants to improve those relations,

600
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,680
my father wouldn’t have been jailed for nothing.

601
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,760
Let’s not talk about this.

602
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:01,520
Let’s go.

603
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,920
I’ll take you ahead for a walk.

604
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,760
Let me show you some uncommon herbs.

605
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:11,920
Let’s go.

606
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,200
This foxtail grass,

607
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,760
removes heat, dampness, and reduces swelling.

608
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,000
Shepherd’s purse is edible

609
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,480
and treats red, painful eyes.

610
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,800
As for Cang’er,

611
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,480
every part of it can be used as medicine.

612
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,320
Its root cures erysipelas.

613
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,080
It also treats dysentery.

614
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,240
Its stem and leaves

615
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,600
can treat dizziness and vertigo.

616
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,760
And its fruit

617
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,280
can treat nasal congestion and runny nose.

618
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,600
Also relieves pain from wind-cold and dampness.

619
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,800
You could say the whole plant is a remedy.
