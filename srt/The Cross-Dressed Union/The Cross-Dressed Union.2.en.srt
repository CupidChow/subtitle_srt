1
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,600
Why is she here?

2
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,040
How did he know I was here?

3
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,080
Miss Nan

4
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,480
No

5
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,960
Madam

6
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,240
You're up

7
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,600
Madam

8
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,520
You got into character fast

9
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,120
Are you looking for a book?

10
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,320
It's nothing

11
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,040
I was just about to go to the front hall

12
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,600
We'll do the tea-serving ceremony soon

13
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,800
With me here,

14
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,000
you don't need to be afraid

15
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,920
Then you

16
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,720
Let's go together

17
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,960
Civil officials really are sly

18
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,000
Father

19
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,840
Chenxiao and I

20
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,320
are here to serve you tea

21
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,040
Father, please have tea

22
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:11,840
Chenxiao

23
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,200
Kneel down

24
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,440
No need to kneel

25
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,440
Get up

26
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,640
Third daughter-in-law

27
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:45,920
Red envelope

28
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,680
Take it

29
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,680
Thank you, Father

30
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,800
Chenxiao

31
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,680
Now that you're married in

32
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,440
we're all family now

33
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,520
From now on

34
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,240
you and Yu'er

35
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,040
must support each other

36
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,000
Yes

37
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,480
I will remember

38
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,000
Everyone, you may leave

39
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,120
Eldest and third sons

40
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,160
stay behind

41
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,200
Madam

42
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,280
Go back and rest first

43
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,440
I'll head back then

44
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,600
Knows her manners

45
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,760
Seriously, Father?

46
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,720
She didn't even kneel during the tea ceremony

47
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,720
Miss Nan is from a military family

48
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,200
she's different from us

49
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,160
so she's naturally more lively

50
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,840
She married me

51
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,600
I've already wronged her enough

52
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,920
I don't want to restrict her over trivial things

53
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,720
From now on

54
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,320
Father and eldest brother,

55
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,120
please don't mind her words or actions

56
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,760
Judging by her behavior today

57
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,840
she's easy to get along with

58
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,080
In the future

59
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,240
I'll spend more time writing in my room

60
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,400
and painting

61
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,240
and just avoid interacting with her

62
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,440
That's fine by me

63
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,960
I'll just stay in my room carving wood

64
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,200
I won't interact with her

65
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,640
I think Lord Rui is a good man

66
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,360
Good? Really?

67
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,200
Didn't you see he kept his two sons behind?

68
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,240
They're probably talking bad about me

69
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,440
Civil officials say one thing to your face

70
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,440
and another behind your back

71
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,160
Chenxiao

72
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:36,920
Wait

73
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,160
Elder sister-in-law

74
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,320
Do you need something?

75
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,560
From now on

76
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,200
we're sisters-in-law

77
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,320
Here in the Rui Residence

78
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,840
if there's anything you don't understand

79
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,960
or want to ask

80
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,160
just come to me

81
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,840
I know all the affairs inside and out here

82
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,200
I'm familiar with everything

83
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,520
There's nothing I need to know

84
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,160
I'm not planning to manage things

85
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,680
You're just afraid of trouble, right?

86
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,480
I've managed the household for years

87
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,520
and never had any real trouble

88
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,840
It's just the socializing in official circles

89
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,120
Now that you're married in

90
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,080
you should mingle with the other ladies

91
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,720
I have a bad temper

92
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,240
I can't do that

93
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,160
Those noble ladies

94
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,440
are all just pretending

95
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,560
You

96
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,520
just need to keep up appearances

97
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:26,880
By the way

98
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,880
I made you some herbal food to replenish your blood

99
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,280
On your first day of marriage

100
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,600
you must take good care of yourself

101
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,120
A woman's body

102
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,200
is delicate

103
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,200
I'm quite healthy

104
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,360
Maybe you should let Rui Yu have it

105
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,360
He needs it more

106
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,480
Why haven't you changed how you address him?

107
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,280
Change to what?

108
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,800
You can't call Xiao Yu by name anymore

109
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,960
You should call him

110
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,640
husband

111
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,680
Isn't that too formal?

112
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,680
Try calling him once

113
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,400
What's wrong?

114
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,080
He's right in front of you

115
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,120
You can say it now

116
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,080
Come here, Xiao Yu

117
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,280
Elder sister-in-law wants me to change how I address you

118
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,320
You two newlyweds can talk

119
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,560
I'll go to the storeroom

120
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,600
Chenxiao

121
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,080
Come find me later

122
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,200
About changing how you address him

123
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,600
No rush

124
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,800
Take your time to get used to it

125
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,840
I need to go to the palace

126
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,880
You'll be home alone

127
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,040
I'll be home alone

128
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,520
That's great

129
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,760
Once you leave

130
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,880
things will be easier

131
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,320
Tell me

132
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,880
Are you letting me go out or not?

133
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:54,720
Servant

134
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,760
I wouldn't dare

135
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,200
Imperial Brother told you to watch me

136
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,920
but didn't say to keep me locked up

137
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,160
So why can't I go out?

138
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,680
Your Majesty said

139
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:02,760
Does it look good?

140
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,040
It looks good

141
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,880
I always tell you to read more

142
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,320
but at crucial moments you only say "looks good"

143
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,200
If Yu brother were here

144
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,640
he'd definitely say

145
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,400
"On a fine day, flowers bloom beautifully"

146
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,400
"Spring beauty misses the flowers' time"

147
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,360
Where's the paste?

148
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,760
This, Princess

149
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:30,680
Close your eyes

150
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:36,760
Princess

151
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:37,960
Don't move.

152
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,640
These two vases

153
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,720
were gifts from my Imperial Brother.

154
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,400
If they get broken,

155
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,640
do you know what will happen?

156
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,160
You know the consequences.

157
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,000
Princess

158
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,880
Princess

159
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,200
Princess, slow down.

160
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,120
Princess

161
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,920
Your Highness

162
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,480
Your Highness

163
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,880
Is my Imperial Brother inside?

164
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,720
Your Highness

165
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,400
Are you

166
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,960
here to see Your Majesty?

167
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,920
Is my Imperial Brother discussing matters
with Rui Yu?

168
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,640
Well...

169
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,120
Your Highness, Your Highness

170
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,960
Rui Yu

171
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,200
Lord Rui

172
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,200
So, Your Majesty means

173
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,720
to send someone to escort Hou Xian
back to Pingxiang

174
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,640
and

175
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,160
help him ascend the throne.

176
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,200
I've thought it over,

177
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,640
and it's best to send you.

178
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:53,920
I

179
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,760
will not fail Your Majesty's trust.

180
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,720
I will depart early tomorrow.

181
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,240
To outsiders,

182
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,440
just say you're going to Pingxiang
to look for books.

183
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,520
Rest and prepare first.

184
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,440
Didn't I grant you a month's leave
when I bestowed the marriage?

185
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,760
Wait until then.

186
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,600
Go after that.

187
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,560
Then I'll return home today

188
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,680
and have my family prepare
for the journey.

189
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,440
I will make sure to conceal
Hou Xian's

190
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,480
safe return.

191
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,600
Nan Chenxiao is from a military family.

192
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,200
With her by your side,
you'll be safer.

193
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,240
You'll be more secure.

194
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,920
This trip is dangerous.

195
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,920
I don't want any more innocent people...

196
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,120
Your Majesty

197
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,320
Lord Rui

198
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,520
Princess Chunxi

199
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,280
is blocking the Imperial Garden gate.

200
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,400
Your- Your Majesty

201
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,080
Then I'll take my leave.

202
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,280
Go ahead.

203
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,000
Wait.

204
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,120
Remember to prepare Nan Chenxiao's
travel bag.

205
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:43,680
I

206
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,640
Rui Yu

207
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:45,680
accept the order.

208
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,720
Lord Rui

209
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,680
Lord Rui

210
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,280
Please follow me, Lord Rui.

211
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,360
Thank you, Eunuch Li.

212
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,200
Rui Yu

213
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:55,600
Rui Yu

214
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,400
Slow down.

215
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,200
Princess

216
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:58,760
Be careful.

217
00:10:59,400 --> 00:10:59,960
Rui Yu

218
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,120
What do you want from me?

219
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,520
I'm not looking for you.

220
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,800
Rui Yu

221
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,400
Rui Yu

222
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:11,800
Come.

223
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,320
Play with me, Rui Yu.

224
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,640
The arrow is nocked,

225
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,520
it must be released.

226
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,040
Lord Rui, Lord Rui, Lord Rui

227
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,800
Minister Liu

228
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,240
Well...

229
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,680
Yesterday at the banquet,
it was rushed.

230
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,640
I didn't get a chance

231
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,160
to properly thank you.

232
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,520
You're too polite, Minister Liu.

233
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,520
But I have things to do today.

234
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:42,880
How about...

235
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,520
Lord Rui

236
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,600
You have time for a few words, right?

237
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,560
Well, I...

238
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,200
prepared a gift for you.

239
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,440
I meant to give it to you
after court.

240
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,520
But you hurried home so quickly.

241
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,440
I understand.

242
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,480
What is it?

243
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,040
I found a rare book for you.

244
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,280
Read it carefully at home.

245
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,800
Thank you, Minister Liu.

246
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,000
Well then,

247
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:09,880
farewell.

248
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,600
Farewell.

249
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,040
Rui Yu

250
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,440
Let's go.

251
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,360
This way, Minister Liu.

252
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,080
Princess

253
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,480
It's all your fault.

254
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,280
You walk too slow.

255
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,640
I couldn't catch up to Rui Yu again.

256
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,640
Did he come by here just now?

257
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,960
Seems like it.

258
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,680
This Rui Residence

259
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,520
is at least three times
the size of our Jiangjun Fu.

260
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,760
How is it going?

261
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,520
Young Master, Young Master!

262
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,320
Watch closely.

263
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,400
The sunlight is right here now.

264
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,040
It will shift in this direction.

265
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,360
This agarwood of mine

266
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,320
can't be exposed directly to sunlight.

267
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,120
Keep an eye on the sunlight for me.

268
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:00,960
Maintain the temperature.

269
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,040
Not too high, not too low.

270
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:03,840
So, should we...

271
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,280
Just move it to the storeroom, right?

272
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,280
What do you know?

273
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,800
Is the storeroom ventilated?

274
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,680
What if this fine wood gets damp?

275
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,160
Just keep watch for me.

276
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,120
It's only three pieces of wood.

277
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,400
If you still mess this up,

278
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,600
see how I'll deal with you.

279
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,120
Yes, yes, Young Master.

280
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:17,520
Alright.

281
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,160
Keep a close watch.

282
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,120
I'm off to walk my birds.

283
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,840
Is the Rui family's eldest son always this free?

284
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,720
This Rui family's eldest son

285
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,560
is a real playboy.

286
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,360
He has some woodcarving skills.

287
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,280
Loves collecting rare wood.

288
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,280
Expert in bug fighting and bird walking.

289
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,520
He's quite the rascal.

290
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,560
So that means

291
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,280
this wood is really important to him.

292
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,120
How's Rui Yu's relationship with his elder brother?

293
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,440
They're actually pretty close.

294
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,200
Seems polite and respectful.

295
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,000
Look at this.

296
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,400
First day after the wedding.

297
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,400
The bride must serve her in-laws at meals.

298
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,520
So,

299
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,720
I need wood to cook, right?

300
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:04,720
Look over there.

301
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,000
It's ready to use.

302
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,520
If you're acting, do the whole act.

303
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,600
I've followed all the rules.

304
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,960
But they still don't like me.

305
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,720
Then I can get a mutual divorce.

306
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,880
Haven't seen Rui Yu's second brother.

307
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,440
No idea what he's like.

308
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,480
I couldn't find out about his second brother.

309
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,680
But I heard he's a scholar.

310
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,000
Find a way

311
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,520
to get those two boys out of here.

312
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:26,880
Yes.

313
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:29,960
Sir.

314
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,960
Smells so good.

315
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,160
Is that the smell of cooking?

316
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,640
Doesn't really smell like it.

317
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,640
I just bought it.

318
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,320
Top-grade agarwood.

319
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,040
I haven't even warmed it up yet.

320
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,320
How did it get burned to charcoal?

321
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,520
Just kick out whoever burned it.

322
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,400
Let me ask you,

323
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,160
who blew up my kitchen?

324
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,320
How would I know?

325
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,440
It was me.

326
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,880
Not your fault, Nan Chenxiao.

327
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,640
Why are you yelling?

328
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:26,720
What's wrong?

329
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,720
Did something serious happen?

330
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,560
What's going on?

331
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,520
My wood

332
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,080
I burned it.

333
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,400
And I blew up the kitchen.

334
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,560
Agarwood.

335
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,800
You're not wrong.

336
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,000
I didn't...

337
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,760
It's about the wood again.

338
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,320
Arguing all day over this pile of wood.

339
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,680
Always bickering.

340
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:46,920
What's the point of arguing?

341
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,040
It's not just some lousy wood.

342
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,600
Eighty taels!

343
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:52,760
That's right, Dad.

344
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,200
Eighty taels!

345
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,400
Why haven't you kicked me out yet?

346
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,640
Eighty taels.

347
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,320
Where did you get eighty taels?

348
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,600
Didn't you give me all your money last time?

349
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,880
Nan Chenxiao bought it.

350
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,360
They came to collect the money.

351
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,520
So I just paid it.

352
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,240
Then why are you crying?

353
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,560
You didn't buy it.

354
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,120
Elder brother paid for it.

355
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,040
So it's definitely his.

356
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,320
What's wrong with elder brother?

357
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,840
I...

358
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,600
This...

359
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:28,760
This...

360
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:37,040
Nan Chenxiao burned the wood she bought.

361
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,080
I thought something serious happened.

362
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:48,760
No,

363
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,440
Why can't you all figure this out?

364
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,440
Elder brother.

365
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,960
Spent eighty taels

366
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,880
on two fine pieces of agarwood.

367
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,240
Elder brother paid.

368
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,800
So it's definitely his.

369
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,880
Then I went to cook.

370
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,840
I used it as firewood.

371
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,680
And blew up the kitchen.

372
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,920
I made such a big mistake.

373
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,800
Aren't you going to react?

374
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,440
I'm not angry.

375
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,200
Don't worry.

376
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,360
You should be angry!

377
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,480
If you're not mad, I'm furious!

378
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,720
Alright, alright.

379
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,480
If it's nothing serious, let's disperse.

380
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,560
Yu'er,

381
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,000
take your third sister-in-law

382
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:30,840
back to her room.

383
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,200
Let her wash her face.

384
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,000
Look,

385
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,360
she's filthy.

386
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,520
Don't dismiss us yet, Dad.

387
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,200
Elder brother.

388
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,480
Sorry.

389
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,680
I apologize to you for Nan Chenxiao.

390
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:45,680
No,

391
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,080
it's all my fault.

392
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:53,840
It's fine, it's fine.

393
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,280
Nan Chenxiao.

394
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,480
Darn it, come back here!

395
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,680
Agarwood.

396
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,600
It's meant to be burned anyway.

397
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,120
Don't take it too seriously.

398
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,000
Who cares about that stuff?

399
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,880
You're cooking?

400
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,160
I'll wait for you in the flower hall.

401
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,280
Wash your face first.

402
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,080
Are civil officials always this tolerant?

403
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,880
What a troublesome time.

404
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,680
Cooked with elder brother's agarwood.

405
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,640
Gives a unique flavor.

406
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,560
Just didn't control the heat well.

407
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,760
Ended up blowing up the kitchen.

408
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,240
Burned with agarwood,

409
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,600
the scent is truly unique.

410
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,400
Sometimes, a little indulgence is good.

411
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,680
Thank you for your hard work.

412
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,400
You.

413
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,880
Don't you have anything to say?

414
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,200
What do you think I should say?

415
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,600
Like kicking me out of the Rui Residence,

416
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:29,840
or

417
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,720
punishing me with family rules.

418
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,120
You just married in.

419
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,560
It's normal to be unfamiliar with many things.

420
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,160
Just send an apology gift to Eldest Brother later.

421
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,160
I'll get you some silver.

422
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,280
Spring Light Poetry Collection.

423
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,680
A colleague just gifted me this rare copy.

424
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,560
I haven't had time to put it in the study.

425
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,320
Is there anything wrong with it?

426
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,440
It should be a good book.

427
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,400
I'm not—

428
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,000
I didn't—

429
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:15,920
You, to me—

430
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:16,920
Yes.

431
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,920
I have things to do, I'll leave first.

432
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,800
Be careful.

433
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,600
Slow down, slow down.

434
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,600
Get on the last carriage.

435
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:28,720
Watch your step.

436
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,600
Sister-in-law.

437
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,720
And also,

438
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,920
Isn't this giving you face?

439
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,760
Let Father-in-law know,

440
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,640
our family is different from others.

441
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,640
Whether civil official or military officer,

442
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,360
we treat everyone equally.

443
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,000
I don't think so.

444
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,400
I thought civil and military could coexist peacefully.

445
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,920
But in the end, conflict is inevitable.

446
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,480
Madam.

447
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,840
Are you angry?

448
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,400
Isn't it obvious whether I'm angry?

449
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,200
Can you be more straightforward as a man?

450
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,120
If—

451
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,360
you don't want to change how you address me,

452
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,880
there's no need to rush.

453
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,840
Can you stop being two-faced?

454
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,200
I've already called you that, and now you say this?

455
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,560
That—

456
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,120
Spring Light Poetry Collection.

457
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,720
It's really not mine.

458
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:24,400
I—

459
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,640
What's wrong with a man reading this?

460
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,120
What does it have to do with me?

461
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,640
No.

462
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:33,680
I'm about to be exposed.

463
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,160
The whole family will die.

464
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:36,720
It's fine.

465
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,040
I don't care.

466
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,400
Father, Mother.

467
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,240
I'm back.

468
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,760
I can't accept such courtesy.

469
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,040
I, Rui Yu, your son-in-law,

470
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,280
greet Father-in-law and Mother-in-law.

471
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:09,960
No need for formalities.

472
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,520
Junior—

473
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,560
Sister.

474
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,040
Junior Sister's husband.

475
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,160
Chenxiao.

476
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,120
You've been married for years,

477
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,880
yet never came back to see me.

478
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,240
This is your husband, Rui Yu?

479
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,760
No, it's not—

480
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,520
The husband's family is busy.

481
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,080
Only now is there time to visit you?

482
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,400
It's all my fault.

483
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,840
I couldn't bring my wife home sooner.

484
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,520
It's fine.

485
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,840
As long as you two are happy,

486
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,360
I'm at ease.

487
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,000
Since you're back,

488
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,240
stay and eat together.

489
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,440
Stay for a meal.

490
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,840
Qiao Youyi is here too.

491
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,440
I'll make you some delicious food.

492
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,120
Rui Yu,

493
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,280
go to the front first.

494
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,360
How did the thing I asked you about yesterday go?

495
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:06,880
Rui Yu,

496
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,520
That Laojun Cypress in front is centuries old.

497
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,240
Can't bear to trim it.

498
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,480
Mother-in-law takes great care of it.

499
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,080
Are you sure there's no problem?

500
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,800
One dose and he'll be just like Father-in-law.

501
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,400
But—

502
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,600
Isn't this too much?

503
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,680
Too much? Darn it.

504
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,080
If I'm exposed, the whole family dies.

505
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,440
Nice color on your clothes.

506
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,160
Qiao Youyi.

507
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,960
Rui Yu, try this.

508
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,760
And this one.

509
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,200
Mother made them all herself.

510
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,680
Thank you, Mother-in-law.

511
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,360
He didn't do anything to you, right?

512
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,680
What could he do?

513
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,320
This is—

514
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,160
Wine brewed by your mother-in-law.

515
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:51,640
Come.

516
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,240
Have a drink.

517
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:52,920
Father-in-law.

518
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,080
A toast to you.

519
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,240
Good.

520
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,240
Junior Sister's husband.

521
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,160
Come.

522
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,520
First time meeting Junior Sister's husband today.

523
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,800
Military officers always drink three cups in a row.

524
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,280
Come.

525
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,160
A toast to you.

526
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,240
I—

527
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,280
I can't drink much.

528
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:15,960
Come on.

529
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:26,840
One more.

530
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,320
Here, the third cup.

531
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,280
I'll finish it.

532
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,400
We've reached the study.

533
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,840
Here, here, here.

534
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,200
Where are you going?

535
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,280
Going to sleep on the bed.

536
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,720
I'll sleep on the couch.

537
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,560
That's the couch.

538
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,480
Your couch.

539
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,600
Alright.

540
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,080
Very good.

541
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,280
Rui Yu.

542
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:42,680
Rui Yu.

543
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,240
Who told you to be a traitor?

544
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,560
Cut off your descendants.

545
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,600
It's justice for heaven.

546
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,200
Nan Chenxiao

547
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,200
Nan Chenxiao

548
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,360
Come out quickly.

549
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,280
Come out, come out.

550
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,120
What's wrong?

551
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,040
I just remembered,

552
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,240
this morning,

553
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,760
your elder brother's letter arrived.

554
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,600
It's for you.

555
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,480
A letter?

556
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
He clearly wrote this before leaving home.

557
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,240
He's already fallen on the battlefield.

558
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,320
How could he still send a letter back?

559
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,680
Mother.

560
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,000
Open it and take a look.

561
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,520
What did your brother write?

562
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,440
Soon, I will go to the border to defend the city.

563
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,640
Missing Father and Mother in my heart,

564
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,440
I wrote these words in this letter.

565
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,400
I hope you always stay diligent.

566
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,240
Though military officers are now in decline at court,

567
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,840
we must not lose our sense of righteousness.

568
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,800
I know your frustration hiding as a daughter.

569
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,480
Even so,

570
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,840
in all you do,

571
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,600
strive to be open and upright.

572
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,320
Only then is your warm heart not wasted.

573
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,840
What did your brother write?

574
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,880
Open and upright.

575
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,240
What I just did

576
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,400
really goes against my brother's teachings.

577
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,360
What did your brother say in the letter?

578
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,760
He said he's doing well at the border.

579
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,720
He told you not to worry.

580
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,480
Why is it always the same words?

581
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,000
He never says anything else.

582
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,760
How is he eating?

583
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,680
How is he living?

584
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,520
I'm really worried.

585
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,320
Mother.

586
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,800
It's getting late.

587
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,120
Go back and rest early.

588
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,240
I almost forgot.

589
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,600
I haven't taken the medicine Qiao Youyi gave me.

590
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,800
Then I'll be going.

591
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,400
Let me see you off.

592
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,920
No need to see me off.

593
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,760
Take good care of Rui Yu.

594
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,480
Rest early.

595
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,800
Go back quickly.

596
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,320
Got it, Mother.

597
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,400
Don't...
