1
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,480
But this is a business matter.

2
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,200
Let their business do better.

3
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,480
If something happens,

4
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,960
just explain it clearly.

5
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,360
How should we talk about this?

6
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,400
Father.

7
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,600
Are you all right?

8
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,600
I'm fine.

9
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,040
Let's discuss it later.

10
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,040
This problem isn't solved yet,

11
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,120
and another one pops up.

12
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,080
Did I say it wrong just now?

13
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,720
YOUR MAJESTY ARRIVES

14
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,720
Paying respects to Your Majesty.

15
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,600
All ministers, rise.

16
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,960
Thank you, Your Majesty.

17
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,320
Present your matters.

18
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,640
If there's nothing, court is dismissed.

19
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,240
Your servant.

20
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,080
I have a memorial.

21
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,600
It's rare for Prime Minister Ming to submit a memorial.

22
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,000
Let me hear it.

23
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,240
What is it about?

24
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,880
I report

25
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,320
General of the North, Nan Hongyi,

26
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,200
violated the rites set by the Late Emperor,

27
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,680
concealing his son Nan Chenxiao's true gender.

28
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,240
Such intent deserves punishment.

29
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,400
Majesty...

30
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,320
Your Majesty.

31
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,080
There is absolutely no such thing!

32
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,400
Prime Minister Ming,

33
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,400
don't make baseless accusations!

34
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,720
This concerns the previous dynasty.

35
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,400
How could I speak carelessly about it?

36
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,360
Your Majesty.

37
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,240
Yesterday, my family

38
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,280
was attacked at our estate outside the city.

39
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,920
After capturing the culprit,

40
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,000
I discovered

41
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,400
he was the assassin who escaped at the last banquet.

42
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,200
A Da Yue killer.

43
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,240
After my interrogation,

44
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,800
I learned these Da Yue people

45
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,880
took such risks

46
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,240
to come to Ling An

47
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,120
not only to assassinate King Wurong,

48
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,440
but also to seek

49
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,800
revenge on the one who killed their king,

50
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,480
Young Master Beicheng.

51
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,240
He confirmed

52
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,000
the one married to Second Rank Grand Scholar

53
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,000
Rui Yu,

54
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,640
Nan Chenxiao, the only daughter of the Nan family,

55
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,040
is actually

56
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,680
Young Master Beicheng.

57
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,600
The Young Master Beicheng King Wurong sought is her.

58
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,600
Isn't she a woman?

59
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,680
So she is Young Master Beicheng.

60
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:19,800
Your Majesty.

61
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,440
Nan Chenxiao is already my wife.

62
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,680
I know her best.

63
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,640
The Nan family's son died at the border.

64
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,560
How can we trust such a schemer's accusation?

65
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,040
How can it be believed?

66
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,400
Whether it's true or not,

67
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,200
just bring Nan Chenxiao here,

68
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,120
and everything

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,800
will be clear.

70
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,840
Your Majesty.

71
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,080
Your servant.

72
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,880
I have followed

73
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,320
the Late Emperor's order

74
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,560
to investigate the exile of military officers.

75
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,320
Due to my oversight,

76
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,720
the Nan family kept this child.

77
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,680
It has caused trouble until now.

78
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,560
They not only hid their identity,

79
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,000
deceived the sovereign,

80
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,520
but also brought Wurong and Da Yue people.

81
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,480
In our country,

82
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,280
they stir up trouble

83
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,880
and act recklessly.

84
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,040
Fortunately,

85
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,600
it hasn't led to disaster.

86
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,080
Please summon Nan Chenxiao to the palace quickly,

87
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,640
to verify her identity.

88
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,560
Your Majesty.

89
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,680
Do as Prime Minister Ming says.

90
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:32,960
Li Quan.

91
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,360
Your old servant will go at once.

92
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,200
Reporting to Your Majesty,

93
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,960
your old servant has confirmed.

94
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,320
Rui's wife—

95
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,080
No,

96
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,280
Nan Chenxiao

97
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,680
is indeed male.

98
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,400
What?

99
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,520
A man?

100
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:17,600
A man?

101
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,320
How bold!

102
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,120
Nan Hongyi,

103
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,360
do you know

104
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,640
violating the Late Emperor's order

105
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,920
and deceiving the sovereign

106
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,480
is a crime punishable by extermination of the nine clans!

107
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,760
I beg Your Majesty to punish us.

108
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,600
Nan Chenxiao.

109
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,440
I personally decreed

110
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,240
your marriage to Rui Yu.

111
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,000
All under heaven know

112
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,960
I arranged this marriage.

113
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,440
Today you confess before all officials,

114
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,600
do you mean to shame me?

115
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,800
I beg for punishment of the Nan family.

116
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,240
Your Majesty.

117
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,680
Your servant is willing to accept

118
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,240
the punishment for the Nan family.

119
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,160
Reporting to Your Majesty,

120
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,720
Prince of Pingxiang sent a secret letter.

121
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,120
Regent King Hou Qi

122
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,680
leads troops to besiege Pingxiang Palace.

123
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,560
Requests our dynasty to send reinforcements.

124
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:28,800
Your Majesty

125
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,080
Our court just formed a new alliance
with Pingxiang.

126
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,080
To set an example,

127
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,360
we must send troops to assist.

128
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,440
Only then can we bring peace
to all lands.

129
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,000
The Left Minister speaks wisely.

130
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,200
Sending troops is not up for debate.

131
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,000
However,

132
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,760
the position of commander

133
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,920
should be given to whom?

134
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,480
Your Majesty,

135
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,520
though the Nan family is guilty,

136
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,720
on the Pingxiang battlefield,

137
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,200
none of the generals present

138
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,000
know it as well as General Nan.

139
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,880
Let General Nan atone with merit.

140
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,720
The guilty Nan Chenxiao
will serve in the army.

141
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,480
Let them serve the nation.

142
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,840
Absurd!

143
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,480
War is no child's play.

144
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,760
The Nan family deceived
Your Majesty—a capital crime.

145
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,440
Rui Yu, your words

146
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,960
are to excuse the Nan family?

147
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,160
The battlefield is perilous.

148
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,520
Moreover,

149
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,320
we are only aiding Pingxiang.

150
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,240
The Nan family is already guilty.

151
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,880
If anything happens in battle,

152
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,920
it serves as their punishment.

153
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,880
Reducing Ling An's losses

154
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,560
is our top priority.

155
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,680
What does the Left Minister think?

156
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:35,760
Your Majesty,

157
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,600
the border is in crisis.

158
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,280
Since General of Manifest Valor
fell for the nation,

159
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,200
no young talent has emerged at court.

160
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,600
I believe the Nan family
should atone by leading the army.

161
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,800
For Ling An,

162
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,600
to relieve our troubles.

163
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,960
If so,

164
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,040
Nan Chenxiao

165
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,080
will join the army at once.

166
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,040
Nan Hongyi

167
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,600
will marshal troops to Pingxiang.

168
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,560
However,

169
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,560
the Capital Guard Commander post

170
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,600
is vacant again.

171
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,600
Vice Minister of War Wei Ming

172
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,400
has long managed the capital's troops.

173
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,520
No one at court

174
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,840
knows this role better than him.

175
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,120
Let him take the post for now.

176
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,000
When Nan Hongyi

177
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,840
returns victorious,

178
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,160
his name will be cleared.

179
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,840
He can resume the post.

180
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,280
Let it be as Prime Minister Ming suggests.

181
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,280
The expedition must not be delayed.

182
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:35,960
The Six Ministries

183
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,720
must give full support.

184
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,560
Your Majesty is wise.

185
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,840
This is most excellent.

186
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,000
Rui Yu,

187
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,160
Rui Yu,

188
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,680
after being deceived

189
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,040
so deeply by the Nan family,

190
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,120
still in court,

191
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,960
you plead for them.

192
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,320
Truly,

193
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,640
I am impressed.

194
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,120
I am thinking for the nation too.

195
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,880
Now is the time to use talent.

196
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,440
War is coming to the border.

197
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,560
We officials

198
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,280
should avoid blame.

199
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,400
What did you say?

200
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,360
Prime Minister Ming,

201
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,520
I have matters at home.

202
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,120
I, Rui, take my leave.

203
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,440
With General Nan, victory is assured.

204
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,440
Thank you for your kind words.

205
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,840
I will not fail to quell Pingxiang's unrest.

206
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,240
Leave coordination of the Six Ministries to me.

207
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,280
Thank you, Left Minister.

208
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,840
He trained in martial arts since childhood.

209
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,880
Finally, it is useful.

210
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,600
Indeed.

211
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:53,880
No, no.

212
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,880
I still don't get it.

213
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,000
You—say it again.

214
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,680
I said,

215
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,000
Chenxiao is actually a man
disguised as a woman.

216
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,280
The marriage was to shield the Nan family,

217
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,400
and to restore Chenxiao's identity one day.

218
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,400
To reopen the martial exam.

219
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,240
Did you know this?

220
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:17,640
I...

221
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,360
I did know.

222
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,040
When did you find out?

223
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,920
Probably

224
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,880
when we first met at the cliff.

225
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,880
You knew and kept it from us,

226
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,640
making me and Father

227
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,200
look like fools.

228
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,240
Who said I didn't know?

229
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,960
When he offered tea,

230
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,200
I saw through it.

231
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,760
That's called seeing but not revealing.

232
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,440
Father, your acting was so real.

233
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,880
No wonder you became a hands-off manager.

234
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:46,760
So,

235
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,680
only I felt sorry for you.

236
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,080
You were devising strategies here.

237
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,640
Ling An

238
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,120
is about to enter

239
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,800
a new era of prosperity.

240
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,680
Well done, Yu'er.

241
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,400
Our Rui family

242
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,720
must protect the court,

243
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,000
defend the worthy, remove the wicked,

244
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,360
and uphold Ling An's

245
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,280
legacy

246
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,960
and prosperity.

247
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,080
Your Majesty,

248
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:43,800
Your Majesty,

249
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,400
I still remember

250
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,480
when I let you found the Hidden Pavilion.

251
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,920
It was the year of your capping ceremony.

252
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,000
Before that,

253
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,880
we were just wandering scholars.

254
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,360
Thanks to Your Majesty,

255
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,760
we found our place.

256
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,320
You travel between many nations,

257
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,040
and know the border terrain well.

258
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,280
With you along,

259
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,600
our chances are greater.

260
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,000
Tomorrow morning,

261
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,240
Chong Ming will escort you to Pingxiang
to prepare.

262
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,640
Welcome the main force through the pass.

263
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,400
This commoner

264
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,000
will not fail Your Majesty's trust.

265
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,160
The situation is complicated now.

266
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,880
The deepest root is yet to be found.

267
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,120
You are the sword hidden in the shadows.

268
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,840
Never reveal your identity lightly.

269
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,400
Your servant obeys.

270
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,680
When you return,

271
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,600
I will personally reward and promote you.

272
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,760
Let's talk about it when you return.

273
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,440
Yes.

274
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,720
Your servant takes his leave.

275
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,240
Nan Chenxiao.

276
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,200
Fall in.

277
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,680
Stand by.

278
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,560
Yes.

279
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,120
Mother.

280
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,560
I'm heading to the front.

281
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,160
Please take care of yourself.

282
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,320
This is an amulet I made for you.

283
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,160
Inside is a peace charm I got for you.

284
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,760
Be sure to keep it with you.

285
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,680
I understand, Mother.

286
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,440
Nan Chenxiao.

287
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,200
My child.

288
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,680
I'll wait for your triumphant return.

289
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,200
I'll be back soon.

290
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,760
Nan Chenxiao.

291
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,720
Mother.

292
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:55,880
Why are you here?

293
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,480
I came to see you off.

294
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,800
I'll wait for you at the camp.

295
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,400
But don't be late.

296
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,960
I understand.

297
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,400
Let me take you somewhere.

298
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,760
I used to come here often.

299
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,840
To overlook all of Jingdu Cheng.

300
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,120
Thinking that one day, sooner or later,

301
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,720
I could walk openly in this city.

302
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,040
And be part of this flourishing era.

303
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,120
Now,

304
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,360
I can finally see hope.

305
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,320
I couldn't tell you in advance.

306
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,160
Sorry for making you worry.

307
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,560
I know it happened suddenly.

308
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,360
How could I blame you?

309
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,320
It's just...

310
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,400
After I leave,

311
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,880
please take good care of yourself.

312
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,080
Don't stay up too late reading.

313
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,920
I'm doing well in the capital.

314
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,680
Don't worry.

315
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,240
I'll be back soon.

316
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,000
Second Prince of Qian Yuan.

317
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,480
Why did he suddenly ask Ling An to send the hostage back?

318
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,440
Hasn't he always sided with the prince—

319
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,640
Qian Yuan must have heard about Pingxiang's unrest.

320
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,680
And that Ling An sent troops to help.

321
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,760
Ling An once let Pingxiang's hostage return early.

322
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,080
Now Qian Yuan wants Pan Zi Zhai to return.

323
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,920
If Ling An refuses,

324
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,960
they'll have a reason to start a war.

325
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,400
Qian Yuan and Pingxiang are far apart.

326
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,400
Once this happened,

327
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,640
Ling An tried to block the news.

328
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,320
But Qian Yuan learned so quickly,

329
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,720
which means in the court,

330
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,280
there are Qian Yuan spies.

331
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,600
Left Minister.

332
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,400
Start investigating this at once.

333
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,360
Be sure to root out the pests of the nation

334
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,680
one by one.

335
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:13,920
Yes.

336
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,360
Your Majesty, what do you think

337
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,320
about arranging Prince Pan's return?

338
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,520
He first asked to marry Prime Minister Ming's daughter at the envoy banquet.

339
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,280
Ming Wanwan.

340
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,280
This morning, he petitioned me in the palace.

341
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,760
He wants to strengthen ties through marriage.

342
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,800
If I don't agree,

343
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,120
it would make Ling An seem petty.

344
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,400
Your Majesty.

345
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,080
Miss Ming has entered the palace.

346
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,080
You may return first.

347
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,480
As for the marriage alliance,

348
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,280
I must discuss it further with the Ming family.

349
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,880
Your servant takes his leave.

350
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,120
Left Minister, Lord Rui.

351
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,360
Miss Ming, please.

352
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,680
Your servant greets Your Majesty.

353
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,320
Rise.

354
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:17,960
Thank you, Your Majesty.

355
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,640
Now,

356
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,640
Now Pan Zi Zhai brings up

357
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,120
the marriage proposal again.

358
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,840
Your father also submitted a memorial.

359
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,240
He agreed to it.

360
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:29,960
But I

361
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,920
still want to hear your thoughts.

362
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,000
If I marry Pan Zi Zhai,

363
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,280
will it ease Your Majesty's worries?

364
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,240
If you marry Pan Zi Zhai,

365
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,880
it will surely strengthen our nations' ties.

366
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,720
It would be a great merit.

367
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,120
What do I need such merit for?

368
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,080
If you are unwilling,

369
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,440
If I am unwilling,

370
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,680
would Your Majesty take me as a consort?

371
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,440
No.

372
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,240
I'm just an official's daughter.

373
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,120
Merit only brings honor to my father.

374
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,800
If I can ease Your Majesty's worries,

375
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,480
I am willing to marry.

376
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,400
Perhaps I

377
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,480
can find you a better match.

378
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,880
That would just be another official.

379
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,320
Not as noble as a princess consort.

380
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,040
But if I marry as the prime minister's daughter,

381
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,720
would it be improper?

382
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,360
I'll have the Queen Mother adopt you.

383
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,880
You'll marry as a Princess, with full rites.

384
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,520
Such a grand wedding,

385
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,040
I would have no regrets.

386
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,160
I haven't visited the Queen Mother in days.

387
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,840
I'd like to see her.

388
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,720
Li Quan.

389
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:58,560
Here.

390
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,360
Escort Miss Ming to the Queen Mother.

391
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,400
Yes.

392
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,640
Your servant takes her leave.

393
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,720
Miss Ming, please.

394
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,440
Attack from the left.

395
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,120
The pass.

396
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,800
My father has led men around to here.

397
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,560
But Hou Qi's men are still defending.

398
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:45,960
It's hard to break through.

399
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,240
The Pingxiang palace is easy to defend, hard to attack.

400
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,680
That's why Hou Xian can hold out here.

401
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,720
But their supplies are limited.

402
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,640
They shouldn't last long.

403
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,680
If we can lure Hou Qi into our trap

404
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,880
and redeploy some of our troops,

405
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,840
to seize the border city,

406
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,000
we might get a chance to defeat the enemy.

407
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,080
That is indeed one way.

408
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,280
But the troops left in the city are too few.

409
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,280
I'm afraid we can't hold out for long.

410
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,760
This really is

411
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,240
a do-or-die battle.

412
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,640
It's the fastest way.

413
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,520
If we keep fighting hard,

414
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,120
it will only give other nations

415
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,440
a chance to rise up in rebellion.

416
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,360
Then Ling An will face

417
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,480
dire straits.

418
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,040
Let's go all out.

419
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,440
What are your chances of winning?

420
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,920
Judging by the defenses of the Prince of Pingxiang's palace,

421
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,440
to capture it all

422
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,200
and redeploy troops

423
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,560
to support the border city

424
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,960
will take at least two days.

425
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,760
But the border city's troops and supplies

426
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
can only last three days.

427
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,680
We have only one chance.

428
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:53,640
Alright.

429
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,920
Since you've made up your mind,

430
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,440
let's go all out.

431
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,200
But the most important thing now

432
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,760
is to make Hou Qi

433
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,280
notice the border city's weakness.

434
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,240
Make him think he can split his forces to take it.

435
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,040
So he can use it as merit

436
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,640
to atone for his crimes when he ascends.

437
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,160
That's easy enough.

438
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,080
I'll send people to spread the news.

439
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,480
You arrange the surprise attack.

440
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,920
Make it look like the city is truly weak.

441
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,880
Act as if we desperately need supplies.

442
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,440
Here,

443
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,600
and here,

444
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,720
are Hou Qi's main defense zones.

445
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,360
This

446
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,760
is the supply camp.

447
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,520
How do you know that?

448
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,600
Could it be

449
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,000
that in Hou Qi's residence

450
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,560
you have your own people?

451
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,800
I stayed at his place for a while before.

452
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,320
Naturally, I learned a few things.

453
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,440
I've always been curious—

454
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,680
in just a few days,

455
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,080
you could plant spies?

456
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,520
How did you do it?

457
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,320
I have my own clever plan.

458
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,200
You handle the fighting.

459
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,320
I'll handle the intelligence.

460
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,720
Each trade has its own master.

461
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,560
This spear is

462
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,080
the Nanjia Spear.

463
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,360
How is my mother's illness?

464
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,720
Don't worry, Princess.

465
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,520
The Queen Mother is just too worried.

466
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,560
It's nothing serious.

467
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,880
But she's always tired.

468
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,520
Why can't she get her energy up?

469
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,640
The Queen Mother

470
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,160
has stayed in the palace too long

471
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,360
and lacks exercise.

472
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,000
That's why she feels unwell.

473
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:01,960
She can

474
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,080
walk outside the palace more

475
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,480
and get some fresh air.

476
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,600
That will

477
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,880
ease her symptoms.

478
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,520
That's good.

479
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,200
Your servant takes leave.

480
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,680
Mother,

481
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,440
you know,

482
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,920
if you come back and stay with me every day,

483
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,120
I'll be cured of any illness.

484
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,080
Alright, since he's not here,

485
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,640
I'll come back and keep you company.

486
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:33,920
He—

487
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,600
Who is "he"?

488
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,920
Didn't you leave the palace for Rui Yu?

489
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,760
I stopped liking him long ago.

490
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,720
I left the palace for—

491
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,360
Queen Mother,

492
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,480
the medicine is ready.

493
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,240
Thank you for your hard work.

494
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,840
Serving the Queen Mother is my duty.

495
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,920
Now that you're a Princess waiting to marry,

496
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,240
I truly feel sorry for you.

497
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,160
It's my honor to marry for our country.

498
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,400
But I can't serve you in the palace anymore.

499
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,600
That makes me sad.

500
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,520
Let's talk about something happy.

501
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,720
Yan Luo,

502
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,760
you're also of marrying age.

503
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,680
You used to only think of Rui Yu.

504
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,760
Now that

505
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,720
you've given up on him,

506
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,280
I

507
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,280
will arrange a marriage for you.

508
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,280
The Left Minister's eldest legitimate grandson.

509
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,280
Mother,

510
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,640
I don't want to marry that Left Minister's grandson!

511
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,880
I have someone I like.

512
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,800
But aren't you—

513
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:44,560
I...

514
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,320
I only admired Brother Yu.

515
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,640
After all I've been through, I realized

516
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,440
the one I truly like

517
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,040
is Brother Yu's second brother, Rui Wang.

518
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,040
Rui...

519
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,640
Rui Wang?

520
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,800
What is his position in court?

521
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,160
The second son Rui hasn't entered officialdom.

522
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,200
He just travels between nations

523
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,560
doing small business.

524
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:07,960
Nonsense!

525
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,480
You're a princess of Ling An.

526
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,240
How can you marry a drifter?

527
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,360
He's not—

528
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,600
This matter

529
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,560
is not for you to mess around with.

530
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,360
For the next few days,

531
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,360
stay in the palace.

532
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,120
I'll have the Left Minister's wife

533
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,960
bring her grandson to the palace

534
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,080
and arrange for you to meet.

535
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:27,960
I won't!

536
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:28,560
Mother!

537
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,120
Your Highness,

538
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,120
it's been a long time since you returned.

539
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,880
Spring Garden is beautiful right now.

540
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,600
Won't you go take a look?

541
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:36,960
Yes,

542
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,760
you two sisters should go out for a walk.

543
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,240
Go back now.

544
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,840
Your child takes leave, your child takes leave.

545
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,160
Let's go.

546
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,200
Princess,

547
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,040
what are you looking at?

548
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,080
Do you think the flowers and birds here

549
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,880
are truly happy?

550
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,760
Don't they feel trapped?

551
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:29,760
Princess,

552
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,160
come.

553
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,600
Don't worry.

554
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,920
Your Majesty and the Queen Mother
both care deeply for you.

555
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,840
They would never let you suffer.

556
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,280
Last time Qian Yuan asked for marriage,

557
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,200
Your Majesty still refused them.

558
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,680
If you keep holding firm this time,

559
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,760
the Queen Mother will understand your feelings.

560
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,880
You care so much for the Crown Prince.

561
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,000
Was it because you didn't persist,

562
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,600
that you had to marry into Qian Yuan?

563
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,840
Our fate

564
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,840
was never truly in our own hands.

565
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,440
Even if we persist,

566
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,680
what good does it do?

567
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,120
But you and I are different people.

568
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,240
Rui Wang's kindness to you

569
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,720
is clear to all of us.

570
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,880
If two hearts truly match,

571
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,120
but end badly due to compromise,

572
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,120
you'll regret it for life.

573
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,760
But Your Majesty has no affection for me.

574
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,120
Why should I force things?

575
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,560
Marrying for the country

576
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,640
is the last thing I do for him.

577
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:36,720
Your Highness,

578
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,760
you are blessed by the heavens.

579
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,840
And you share true love with your beloved.

580
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,720
Don't let yourself have regrets.

581
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,440
But...

582
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,480
What should I do?

583
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,000
Go find him.

584
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,360
Let the Queen Mother

585
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,680
know your true feelings.

586
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,720
There's a fire!

587
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,320
Fire!

588
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,440
The supply camp is on fire!

589
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,560
Put out the fire! Hurry!

590
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,720
Grab something to fight the fire!

591
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,160
Go, go, go!

592
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,360
Nan Chenxiao!

593
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,400
You bastard, ambushed me!

594
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:26,720
Loose the arrows!

595
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:38,840
Retreat!

596
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,920
We're surrounded!

597
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,000
Don't panic!

598
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,920
Watch me kill Nan Chenxiao!

599
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,400
Seize Ling An's supplies!

600
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,840
Little brat!

601
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,440
Only know how to play dirty.

602
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,200
If you dare, fight me head-on!

603
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,320
Reporting to Prince,

604
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,840
Ling An's troops have surrounded our rear.

605
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,200
I'm afraid we can't win.

606
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,680
All troops, fall back to base!

607
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:03,800
Yes!

608
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,440
Retreat!

609
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,160
Pan Zi Zhai returned to Qian Yuan

610
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,440
and stands as a rival to the Second Prince.

611
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,600
He insists on negotiating with Ling An now

612
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,520
to benefit Qian Yuan.

613
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,120
Your Majesty,

614
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,640
he's stationed troops outside Jiaozhou City

615
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,040
to force Ling An to negotiate.

616
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,200
Before this,

617
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,280
he used the marriage alliance to mislead us.

618
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,840
Now he suddenly breaks the treaty.

619
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:43,800
This...

620
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,880
This means he wants war with us!

621
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,480
Your Majesty,

622
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,280
Wu Rong and Ling An have allied.

623
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,240
If Ling An and Wu Rong attack Qian Yuan together,

624
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,880
they can't resist.

625
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,720
The south is in chaos now.

626
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,760
The people are unsettled.

627
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,000
The north must not falter.

628
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,040
Your servant believes

629
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,920
Your Majesty should leave the palace to pray for blessings.

630
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,440
To calm the people's hearts.

631
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,680
That is wise.

632
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,840
Then I and the Ministry of Rites will confirm the ceremony today.

633
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,800
We can go to the altar outside the city in two days.

634
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,680
The altar outside the city

635
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,000
is only for rain prayers and royal offerings.

636
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,280
The late emperor set the prayer altar

637
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,480
in the north.

638
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,720
For Your Majesty to pray,

639
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,200
you must go to our dynasty's roots.

640
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,440
Only then will the heavens hear.

641
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,360
Qian Yuan is watching us closely.

642
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,920
Your Majesty going north

643
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,320
is too dangerous.

644
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,880
Ling An is a great and powerful nation.

645
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,760
How could we fear

646
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,640
a mere vassal state?

647
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,480
The late emperor's rules must not be abandoned.

648
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,920
When the ruler prays for blessings,

649
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,320
he must go north.

650
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,720
If so,

651
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,000
the Ministry of Rites will draft the procedures.

652
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,440
Hanlin Academy Second Rank Scholar Rui Yu

653
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,040
will accompany the envoy to Qian Yuan.

654
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,040
To show our nation's might.

655
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,240
Your Majesty is wise.

656
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:08,680
General,

657
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:13,680
What's this?

658
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:14,880
This is...

659
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,320
It came with the supplies.

660
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,440
It's for Rui Wang from the Princess.

661
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,560
The Princess asked you to give it to me?

662
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:21,800
Yes.

663
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,040
What is it?

664
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:23,840
So mysterious.

665
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,360
Princess.

666
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,240
This...

667
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:34,400
Th-this...

668
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:34,920
You...

669
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,560
This isn't me.

670
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,040
This...

671
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:37,920
Come, come.

672
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,080
I'm starving!

673
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,160
Quick!

674
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,240
Get me something to eat!

675
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,000
Princess.

676
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,840
Princess! Princess!

677
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,760
It smells amazing!

678
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,440
I've never thought food

679
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,200
could taste this good.

680
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,640
Nonsense!

681
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,960
Why aren't you staying in the palace?

682
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,120
Why did you come here?

683
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:04,760
I...

684
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,920
I just wanted to see you.

685
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,280
The battlefield is dangerous.

686
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,240
With you here, we have to worry about you.

687
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:14,760
How can we...

688
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,640
I won't run around.

689
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,200
I won't cause you trouble.

690
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,720
I couldn't see you,

691
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,360
and I was so worried.

692
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,000
I'm sorry.

693
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,680
Princess, you truly arrived at a bad time.

694
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,360
Hou Qi's main force

695
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,000
is already heading toward the border city.

696
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,280
A fierce battle is about to break out soon.

697
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,520
I'm sorry.

698
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,440
I was too reckless.

699
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,240
But it wasn't entirely useless.

700
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,560
It drew Hou Qi to shift his troops.

701
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,880
It's still far too risky.

702
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,200
The people in the city

703
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,640
have begun leaving to seek safety.

704
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,240
But everyone is anxious.

705
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,960
Princess, would you help my second brother

706
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,560
to calm the people

707
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,400
and escort them out of the city?

708
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,040
Can I... am I allowed?

709
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,760
You are the Princess of Ling An.

710
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,000
The people

711
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,600
will feel protected by you.

712
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,640
They'll evacuate in an orderly way.

713
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,320
General.

714
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,040
The scouts have reported.

715
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,280
Hou Qi has camped three hundred paces from the city.

716
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,480
Understood.

717
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,560
Rui Wang.

718
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,520
I'll leave the people to you.

719
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,080
Don't worry.

720
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,080
Let's go.

721
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,720
Miss Qiao.

722
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,120
Master Rui.

723
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,440
Here are the tonic herbs you requested.

724
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:21,800
Thank you.

725
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,080
I heard

726
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,560
you're leaving for a distant place?

727
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:26,840
Yes.

728
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,480
I just received Jiaozhou City's defense map.

729
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,840
The southern front is tense now.

730
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,080
Qian Yuan in the north is also watching closely.

731
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,600
Prime Minister Ming and the ministers urge Your Majesty to go north to pray.

732
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,640
I must act as envoy

733
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,080
and go to Qian Yuan for negotiations.

734
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,680
The situation is so dire.

735
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,520
Your Majesty is actually leaving Jingdu Cheng.

736
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,200
The Late Emperor set the royal altar in the north.

737
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,200
Ling An governs by ritual.

738
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,280
Your Majesty must comply.

739
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:00,920
Master Rui.

740
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,320
May I trouble you with something?
