1
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,680
Eunuch Li

2
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,680
Your Majesty

3
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,600
Lord Rui

4
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,000
His Majesty is busy right now

5
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,920
Please come back another day

6
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,640
I'm not going in

7
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,120
But the memorial

8
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,200
Please, Eunuch, deliver it for me

9
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:12,920
Lord Rui

10
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,240
I'm not making things difficult for you

11
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,760
Recently, generals keep getting into trouble

12
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,760
Right now

13
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,800
His Majesty is discussing this with
Left Minister and Minister Ming

14
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,040
Lord Rui is related to the generals

15
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,360
It's best to avoid suspicion

16
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,400
I understand

17
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,480
The memorial

18
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,280
Please deliver it for me, Eunuch

19
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:00,920
Your Majesty

20
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,240
Lord Rui

21
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,920
He left after submitting the memorial

22
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,120
Just leave it there

23
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,560
Yes

24
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,560
General Qian

25
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,920
He harassed a fisherwoman

26
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,960
and killed her in public

27
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,160
General Qiao secretly lent usury

28
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,720
These are serious crimes in our dynasty

29
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,280
Lord Rui is related to the generals

30
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,480
It's inevitable

31
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,200
Concern clouds judgment

32
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,920
Generals committing crimes is a grave matter

33
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,240
I wonder

34
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,640
what the two chief judges of this case

35
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,200
think about it

36
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,600
I

37
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,840
will thoroughly investigate both cases

38
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,200
and allow no mistakes

39
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,880
I believe

40
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,320
we should choose someone for this case

41
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,800
who has no connections at all

42
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:56,920
Left Minister

43
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,680
What do you mean by that?

44
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,440
Minister Ming

45
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,200
once oversaw the exile of generals

46
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,720
If he judges this case again

47
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,880
it might easily

48
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,520
cause controversy

49
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,200
Left Minister makes sense

50
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,600
This case does need further discussion

51
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,320
How about this

52
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,240
Left Minister

53
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,200
Go back

54
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,040
and draft a list of suitable candidates

55
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,240
Submit a memorial

56
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,000
Yes

57
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,200
Then I shall take my leave

58
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,560
I take my leave

59
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,440
Don't panic

60
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,880
Rui Yu has already entered the palace

61
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,880
Father's health is poor, how can I not worry?

62
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,400
Junior

63
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,840
Why do others lend usury

64
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,040
and just wait at home to be summoned

65
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,800
but my father was thrown straight into jail

66
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,800
And Uncle Qian

67
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,080
He may be quick-tempered

68
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,640
but how could he kill someone in public?

69
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,840
He Zhaoyin made the arrests

70
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,520
He's from Minister Ming's faction

71
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,920
They don't care about generals' explanations

72
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,240
Father

73
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,880
We can't rely too much on Rui Yu

74
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,560
He's fighting the whole court alone

75
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,000
It's hard for him

76
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,520
I understand

77
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,960
I'll also go out to gather news and find a way

78
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,640
But the palace's stance

79
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,240
won't be clear until Rui Yu returns

80
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,440
My lord has returned

81
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,280
He went with Left Minister

82
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,680
to Piyun Pavilion together

83
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,080
Let's go too

84
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,760
Before Rui Yu returns

85
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,600
let's wait

86
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,040
It's been a long time since I visited you

87
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,360
Please forgive me, Teacher

88
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,400
Hanlin Academy affairs are busy

89
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,920
You've devoted your mind

90
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,400
entirely to official duties

91
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,000
That's a good thing

92
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,760
I still remember when I first entered office

93
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,160
Your every word of advice

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,200
led me to today's achievements

95
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:57,960
Enough

96
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,320
No need for formalities between us

97
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,920
You're worried about those generals

98
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,400
so you hurriedly

99
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,240
invited me here, right?

100
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,120
You see through me, Teacher

101
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,680
General Qiao and General Qian

102
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,760
are not criminals

103
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,360
You should not get involved

104
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,080
His Majesty refused you in the palace

105
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,400
That shows his stance

106
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,080
You must avoid suspicion

107
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,360
I understand

108
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:27,800
But I

109
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,760
don't want to be the chief judge

110
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,040
I want to recommend someone

111
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,000
My lord, please

112
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,760
Did Lord Rui invite me for good food

113
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,720
or good wine?

114
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,720
This humble official

115
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,920
greets Left Minister

116
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,520
Lord Rui

117
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,720
Teacher

118
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,920
This is the Hanlin Academy scholar

119
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,000
Liu Zhi

120
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,840
I wish to recommend him

121
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,760
as the chief judge for this case

122
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,760
Lord Liu is sharp and wise

123
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,680
and never joins factional disputes

124
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,520
His family has no ties to the generals

125
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,200
He's the best candidate

126
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,000
He's close to you

127
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,280
That's not appropriate

128
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,240
Anyone can be close to Lord Liu

129
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,560
I'm no exception

130
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,440
Reporting to Left Minister

131
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,560
Perhaps it's because I

132
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,520
can't compete or snatch anything

133
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,520
so

134
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,800
all the lords

135
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,720
are willing to speak with me more

136
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,560
So, in that case

137
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,120
you're rather sly

138
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,040
neither close nor distant

139
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,760
so you have no ties or burdens

140
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,960
In this regard

141
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,600
you should learn from Lord Liu

142
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,360
I understand

143
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,680
Though I dislike rash warriors

144
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,800
when handling cases

145
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,440
one must be fair

146
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,520
If it's found these two

147
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,360
are truly innocent

148
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,840
I

149
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,360
will report to Your Majesty myself

150
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,360
Tomorrow, I'll submit a memorial

151
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,640
I

152
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,320
will have Your Majesty

153
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,240
take note of Liu Zhi

154
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,160
Thank you, Left Minister

155
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,520
You are trusted by Your Majesty

156
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,200
Remember

157
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,320
do not be impatient or irritable

158
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,720
so as not to

159
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,840
give others something to use against you

160
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,640
I will keep that in mind

161
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,640
Why isn't he back yet?

162
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,000
He's so slow gathering news

163
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,880
Even the street vendors are faster

164
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,440
Princess

165
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,080
Wanwan

166
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,880
Why are you in such a hurry to go?

167
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,320
Did you just come from the Empress Dowager's palace?

168
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,520
What is the Empress Dowager doing now?

169
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,600
She just took her medicine

170
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,640
and is now resting

171
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,280
You come to the palace daily to care for her

172
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,280
You've worked hard

173
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,640
The Empress Dowager treats me kindly

174
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,200
It's what I ought to do

175
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,480
Princess

176
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,840
Your Majesty summoned Left Minister and Minister Liu

177
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,280
to discuss disaster relief

178
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,000
They likely won't leave the Hall of Diligence today

179
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,160
So that means

180
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,440
no one's watching me

181
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:10,920
Yes

182
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,840
I'm going back to change clothes

183
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:15,960
Princess

184
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,800
You're not sneaking out of the palace, are you?

185
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,080
It's been half a month since I returned from Pingxiang

186
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,240
I've been staying obediently in the palace every day

187
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm really bored to death

188
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,240
Wanwan

189
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,600
You must keep this secret for me

190
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,720
If my brother or mother asks you, just say

191
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,280
just say

192
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,280
whatever comes to mind

193
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:34,920
Princess

194
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,000
Don't follow me

195
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,280
Yu'er knows how to handle things

196
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,240
Chen Xiao

197
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,440
is also good at strategy

198
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,160
You can safely return to Qiemo

199
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,160
I've

200
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,760
caused you trouble

201
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,320
Not at all

202
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,840
Thanks to you

203
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,120
they returned safely

204
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,600
But now

205
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,680
the situation is unstable

206
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,800
if you stay in Ling An

207
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,280
it may not be safe

208
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:16,840
Then I'll

209
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,040
return to Qiemo first

210
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,600
and wait for Brother Rui

211
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,960
and news from Young Master Nan

212
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,480
Take care

213
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,160
Take care

214
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,720
Master

215
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,960
None of us can help Yu'er

216
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,160
In three days

217
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,800
a group of beggar children will be sent out of the city

218
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,600
Which gate will they use?

219
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,720
Most likely Xihua Gate

220
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,880
The guards there

221
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,520
are close with Minister Ming

222
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,480
You've investigated for days

223
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,640
and only saw Minister Ming's steward

224
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,400
taking money from the broker

225
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,120
They can still deny everything

226
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,000
If we act rashly

227
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,840
we'll alert them for sure

228
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,200
If we don't act

229
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,680
it'll be hard to find those

230
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,800
beggar children after they're sold

231
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,120
Minister Ming

232
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,320
He visited our home before

233
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,880
looking for Father and Yu'er

234
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,960
hoping to use the Spring Imperial Examination

235
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,120
to cultivate his own faction

236
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,560
He always advocates suppressing the generals

237
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,240
The case of General Qiao and General Qian

238
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,600
must be connected to him

239
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,480
Have the provincial examinations ended everywhere?

240
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,440
If you count the days

241
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,280
Yes, they've all ended

242
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,240
Keep a close watch

243
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,640
Send any news about the exams back immediately

244
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,880
Since the beggar children case leads nowhere

245
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,120
we'll have to try another approach

246
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,600
Rescue them tonight

247
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,760
Wait for the right moment

248
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,400
Yes, Master

249
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,680
I'll handle it right away

250
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:32,920
Lord Liu

251
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,520
My dear Lord Rui

252
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,120
You called me here for such a big matter

253
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:38,800
and you didn't even

254
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,640
give me any warning

255
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:42,760
So

256
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,960
you don't want to take this job?

257
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,440
I'm used to a leisurely life

258
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:48,920
Besides

259
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,080
I'm just an unknown general and scholar

260
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,080
What can I really do?

261
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,840
Speaking of which

262
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,200
I've never understood this about you

263
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,400
You're clearly very capable

264
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,520
Why hide your talent behind modesty?

265
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,120
Me

266
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,800
I come from a humble family

267
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,000
I only sought success

268
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,640
so my family wouldn't be bullied anymore

269
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,920
But after receiving an official post

270
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,240
I felt the court was even more chaotic

271
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,640
I don't want to get involved

272
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,320
I'd rather be a clean Hanlin scholar

273
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,720
and live peacefully

274
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,560
That's good enough

275
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:33,880
You

276
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,280
Why are you so calm about this?

277
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:37,960
Don't you have

278
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,080
anything to ask me, or to argue back?

279
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,960
If you truly just want to protect yourself,

280
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,240
just now,

281
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,280
you could've refused in front of the teacher.

282
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,680
But you didn't do that.

283
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,080
I...

284
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,280
Let me guess.

285
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,560
You're not afraid of getting involved.

286
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,920
You're just worried

287
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,400
that the Liu family

288
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,640
has no power or influence.

289
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,480
You serve the country,

290
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,040
eliminate traitors,

291
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,280
but fear your family will be implicated.

292
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,000
Yes.

293
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,120
I can't let my family get dragged in.

294
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,800
But I don't want to pick a side either.

295
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,120
Whether it's civil officials

296
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,120
or military generals,

297
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,840
for a nation to prosper,

298
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:17,800
both civil and military

299
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,280
are indispensable.

300
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,880
Why must we take sides?

301
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,360
If you have ambition,

302
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,520
you can give it your all

303
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,080
to balance civil and military power.

304
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,360
Yes.

305
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,640
But if I do that,

306
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,120
my family members,

307
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,160
they...

308
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,200
I, Rui Yu, am not talented,

309
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,760
but now,

310
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,400
I'm only second rank.

311
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,640
Still,

312
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,600
I have some reputation at court.

313
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,840
If you're willing,

314
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,640
I'm willing to shelter you.

315
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,280
Let's accomplish this together.

316
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,960
Only second rank...

317
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,280
Only you,

318
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,600
Lord Rui, would dare say that.

319
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:02,840
Lord Rui,

320
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,280
Since I've accepted this task,

321
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,600
I'll give it my all.

322
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,880
What's this?

323
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,360
What is this thing?

324
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,720
Red bean buns, pork buns.

325
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,720
Bun shop.

326
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,640
Fresh pork buns!

327
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,960
Come and take a look!

328
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,400
That sly fox said once,

329
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,960
What did he say again?

330
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,320
Fengdong Bun Shop's red bean buns are the best.

331
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,120
Let's buy some as a gift.

332
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,720
Here, for you.

333
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,000
Hold it tight.

334
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,400
Here.

335
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,360
Thank you.

336
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,680
Kid.

337
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,280
Boss.

338
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,920
Give me a basket of red bean buns.

339
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,440
Miss,

340
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,200
what a pity.

341
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,520
The last basket of buns

342
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,240
was bought by this little girl.

343
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,640
Smells so good.

344
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,840
When will the next batch be ready?

345
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,200
At least the time it takes to burn one incense stick.

346
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,160
One incense stick...

347
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:25,840
This...

348
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,280
Smells amazing.

349
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,280
Little one,

350
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,880
can you

351
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,880
share with me,

352
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,200
two red bean buns?

353
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,040
Sure.

354
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,960
Trade for sticky rice cake.

355
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:38,840
Sticky rice cake?

356
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,480
Yes.

357
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,280
This...

358
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,800
Where do I buy sticky rice cake?

359
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,360
You don't know that?

360
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,200
Come with me.

361
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:47,840
Let's go.

362
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:00,760
Go.

363
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,160
Hurry up.

364
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,360
Behave.

365
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,000
What did you bring back?

366
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,360
Just a few days ago,

367
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,600
didn't someone die of illness?

368
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,200
With less stock,

369
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,400
we won't have enough silver.

370
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,600
Guess what?

371
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,840
On the street,

372
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,760
I ran into two girls.

373
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,360
No one was with them.

374
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,480
They looked pretty fresh.

375
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,480
So I just

376
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,080
grabbed them and brought them back.

377
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,840
Untie them quickly.

378
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,080
Don't suffocate them.

379
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:55,880
Open up.

380
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,960
Why is there no movement?

381
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,280
Nothing happened, right?

382
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,520
These two girls

383
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,040
are tough.

384
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,280
Look, she bit me.

385
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,520
So I gave them

386
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,520
some knockout powder.

387
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,480
It's fine.

388
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,600
You can tell these two

389
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,920
are spoiled.

390
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,600
You must've kidnapped some official's daughter.

391
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,520
With so many of us,

392
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,920
we'd all lose our heads.

393
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,200
No way.

394
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,280
Look,

395
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,600
this one,

396
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:43,920
is still wearing

397
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,360
maid's clothes.

398
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,800
It's me, it's me.

399
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,000
Second Brother!

400
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,080
Why are you here?

401
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,200
I just saw two little girls

402
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,760
a man was carrying them this way.

403
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,040
They must've been taken to that courtyard.

404
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,000
That courtyard has kidnapped many beggar children.

405
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,000
Tonight they'll be sent out of the city to be sold.

406
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,720
Are you sure?

407
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,160
Then let's act quickly!

408
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,480
Don't rush.

409
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,960
Their goal is to sell the children.

410
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,360
So before leaving the city,

411
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,560
the girls should be safe.

412
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,360
My people

413
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,960
are already surrounding the area.

414
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,680
I guess these people

415
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,240
will leave at dusk when vendors pack up.

416
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,640
We'll strike during the chaos.

417
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,920
It won't cause a commotion.

418
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,480
So dizzy...

419
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,160
Awake.

420
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,040
Sirs,

421
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,480
you must be exhausted too.

422
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,120
How about

423
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,560
I take you to the best restaurant for a meal?

424
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,520
You’re just a lowly maid.

425
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,120
How many coins could you possibly have?

426
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,440
I...

427
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,880
I suddenly...

428
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,560
My stomach suddenly hurts so much.

429
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,840
Please, sirs, I beg you—

430
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,640
Take me to see a doctor, please!

431
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,440
Hold it in.

432
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,560
To be honest with you all,

433
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,040
I’ve been sickly since I was little.

434
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,280
Just the other day, I caught tuberculosis.

435
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:38,520
Boss,

436
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,120
she just bit me!

437
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,440
I won’t catch anything, will I?

438
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:41,960
Boss...

439
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,840
No, let’s get a doctor.

440
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:44,960
Don’t believe her.

441
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,440
This girl looks perfectly healthy.

442
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,720
She doesn’t look at all

443
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,600
like a maid who does hard labor.

444
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,800
Besides, the order from above is enough people.

445
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,120
As for who those people are,

446
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,080
their quality doesn’t matter.

447
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,400
That’s not our concern.

448
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,320
Fine.

449
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,360
You—

450
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,200
go find Steward Ming.

451
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,520
Explain this whole thing

452
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,560
clearly to him.

453
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,920
See if they

454
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,680
want to keep or release her.

455
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:16,720
Yes.

456
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,360
Everyone heard that, right?

457
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,760
If there’s no word from above,

458
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,560
during this time,

459
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,000
no one is allowed to harm her.

460
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,240
Not even a single hair can be touched.

461
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,560
Is that clear?

462
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,320
Didn’t expect it, Second Brother—

463
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,240
you have people everywhere.

464
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,520
Let’s stick to the plan.

465
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,320
We move at dusk.

466
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,280
Alright.

467
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,880
Help!

468
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,200
Help!

469
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,200
Shut up!

470
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,440
That voice...

471
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,640
Princess! Princess!

472
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,720
What are you staring at?

473
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,400
Go!

474
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,480
Beat her up!

475
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,560
Don’t come any closer!

476
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,200
I’m the sister of Liu Zhi, Second-Rank Scholar of the Hanlin Academy!

477
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,960
He’s a favorite at court right now.

478
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,120
If you dare lay a hand on us,

479
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,360
watch your heads!

480
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,360
Scholar Rui...

481
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,360
has a sister?

482
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,160
The Rui family is just three brothers.

483
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,600
No girls.

484
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,200
So she’s making it up?

485
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:40,960
Miss Rui,

486
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,920
it’s not that we won’t let you go,

487
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:43,920
but you—

488
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,560
words alone aren’t proof.

489
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,480
I...

490
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,960
Just you wait!

491
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,800
This is the token my brother Yu gave me!

492
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,800
It’s a real palace token!

493
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,240
We’re in big trouble now.

494
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,240
What’s wrong?

495
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,800
Once she gets back,

496
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,360
the Rui family will definitely report us.

497
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,160
Then we’ll all be in deep trouble.

498
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,000
Why don’t we, while she’s—

499
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,560
before the Rui family finds out,

500
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,760
get rid of her.

501
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,840
Alright.

502
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,760
Don’t come over! Stay back!

503
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,040
Stop!

504
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,600
Princess!

505
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,600
Are you alright?

506
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,440
Bad Fox, why did you only just get here?

507
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,400
I was scared to death!

508
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,280
It’s okay now, it’s okay.

509
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,120
Why is Hanzhen here too?

510
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,200
Uncle Rui!

511
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:00,840
Don’t be afraid.

512
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,880
You’re safe now.

513
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,480
You’re from Wurong.

514
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,680
Master! Master! Master!

515
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,200
I’ve already finished here and you’re just arriving.

516
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,600
Isn’t that embarrassing?

517
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,520
Take these people

518
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,760
to the authorities and hand them to Yu’er.

519
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:32,600
Yes.

520
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:34,760
Bad Fox!

521
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,400
Let’s go.

522
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:36,560
Go.

523
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,080
Get up.

524
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:38,880
Let’s go, Princess.

525
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:39,960
I’ll escort you back to the palace.

526
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,960
Will you come back to the palace with me?

527
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,360
We’re on the same side.

528
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,000
Hurry and take them back.

529
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:49,800
Yes.

530
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:52,720
Go.

531
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:53,600
Go through the children’s gate.

532
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,200
Let’s go, little sister.

533
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,600
Slow down.

534
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,440
Go.

535
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,080
Go see my royal brother.

536
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,840
Otherwise, my brother will scold me.

537
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,120
Let’s go together.

538
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,800
Alright, alright.

539
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:06,920
Let’s go.

540
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:08,880
Come.

541
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,760
But—

542
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,440
I need to take my niece back first.

543
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,320
Niece.

544
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:17,960
Be good.

545
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,800
She got separated from her parents.

546
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,720
I’ll take you to the authorities soon.

547
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,880
They’ll help you find your parents.

548
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,520
Stop!

549
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,920
Lord Liu!

550
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,120
What do you mean?

551
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,880
Handle the case impartially.

552
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:02,880
Please,

553
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,360
Minister Ming, cooperate.

554
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,320
Search for me!

555
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:10,960
Yes.

556
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,600
Sir.

557
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,200
Go.

558
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,320
It’s alright.

559
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,760
We should trust Father.

560
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,480
Search for me!

561
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,240
Yes.

562
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,160
Really...

563
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,240
What a clever move.

564
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:58,880
Stop!

565
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,400
Stop!
