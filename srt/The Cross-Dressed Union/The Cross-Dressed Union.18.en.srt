1
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,880
One dose every day

2
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,280
Take it in three separate doses

3
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,280
Why do I still have to drink this?

4
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,680
You're so badly hurt

5
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,000
You need to restore your energy

6
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,760
You don't want to drink it, do you?

7
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,240
Darn it, do you want a long life or not?

8
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,240
Then I'll throw it away

9
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,120
I'll drink it, I'll drink it

10
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,720
Martial Uncle heals the world

11
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,960
Saving me is just a small favor

12
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,640
It's just a flick of your finger

13
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,000
You sure know how to flatter

14
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,040
Thank you, Mr. Yu

15
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,320
Another day

16
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,840
I'll come again to thank you in person

17
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,280
No, no, no

18
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,880
I just don't like crowds

19
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,080
I prefer peace and quiet

20
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,600
But you clearly love lively company

21
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,960
You always invite me and Senior Sister to chat

22
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,840
What are you mumbling about?

23
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,600
I'm just grateful for Martial Uncle's kindness

24
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,640
Enough, stop talking

25
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,160
Let's hurry and get going

26
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,480
I'll visit often

27
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,440
There's nothing special here

28
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,680
It's just that

29
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,640
Sunsets are free

30
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,240
Spring, summer, autumn, winter

31
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,480
All of them

32
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,080
Take care of yourself

33
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,920
Farewell, Martial Uncle Yu

34
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,440
Let's go

35
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,080
Miss

36
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,080
Wanwan

37
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,560
Greetings, Father and Mother

38
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,800
You're in such a hurry

39
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,640
Where did you go?

40
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,600
A proper young lady

41
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,600
Shouldn't stay out all night

42
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,520
If word gets out, our family's reputation is ruined

43
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,760
Tell me, where did you go?

44
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,320
I spent last night in the palace

45
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,560
Then why didn't you send someone to inform us?

46
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,120
Your Majesty asked me to stay

47
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:24,920
So

48
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,600
Your Majesty

49
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,520
Did you two...

50
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,320
No

51
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,960
Your Majesty and I are completely innocent

52
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,520
We never crossed any boundaries

53
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,080
Your Majesty just asked me to review poetry

54
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,280
I forgot to send word home

55
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,360
I made Father and Mother worry

56
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,640
As your father

57
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,200
I worry about your safety

58
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:50,920
You must have been scared

59
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,120
You look so pale

60
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,120
Your Majesty too

61
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,880
Why don't you care about others at all?

62
00:04:59,440 --> 00:04:59,920
Enough

63
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,560
Go back and rest now

64
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,560
Yes

65
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,760
Your daughter takes her leave

66
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,680
Go on, go on, go on

67
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,200
A good thing is about to happen

68
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,600
Qin Tian Jian said my Ba Zi is weak

69
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,800
The palace's feng shui is too strong

70
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,040
I'm easily affected by it

71
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,080
Someone like me

72
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,240
A princess as beautiful as a flower

73
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,040
If I were to die young

74
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,120
Royal Brother

75
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,080
Wouldn't you regret it?

76
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,640
Just say what you want

77
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,560
Rui Yu's residence has perfect feng shui

78
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,720
Second Brother Rui's Ba Zi matches mine

79
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,280
It's just right for me

80
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,240
To rest and recover

81
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,960
Royal Brother

82
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,840
My very, very, very best Royal Brother

83
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,560
Please let me go

84
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,240
I promise

85
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,600
I'll behave and stay at Rui's residence

86
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,840
And listen to Rui Yu

87
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,520
Your Majesty

88
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,600
Master Rui has arrived.

89
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,240
Summon.

90
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,320
Yes.

91
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,240
Summon.

92
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,960
Master Rui requests an audience.

93
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,960
She came on her own.

94
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,760
Speak to her yourself.

95
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,360
If she agrees,

96
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,320
I will let you leave the palace.

97
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,000
Rui Yu definitely won't agree.

98
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,520
Your Majesty

99
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,680
Princess

100
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,480
No need for formalities.

101
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,880
The newly appointed Hanlin scholars

102
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,760
are still useful, aren't they?

103
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,720
They're all outstanding among the new generation.

104
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,040
I am ashamed to be less than them.

105
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,120
Too much humility

106
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,640
is just another form of boasting.

107
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,080
Royal brother

108
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,600
Royal brother

109
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,680
Qin Tian Jian reports

110
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,200
that the Princess and you

111
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,600
have incompatible Ba Zi.

112
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,760
Your fates clash.

113
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,640
No, no.

114
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,080
My Ba Zi is weak.

115
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,760
I can't handle the palace's fortune.

116
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,680
Besides,

117
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,080
I've been coughing a lot lately.

118
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,160
Look,

119
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,760
even the imperial physician

120
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,800
says there's no real cause.

121
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,560
But still,

122
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,840
it can't be cured.

123
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,200
It's all because of my Ba Zi.

124
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,760
But with your family,

125
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,040
my Ba Zi matches unexpectedly.

126
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,760
So,

127
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,400
can I move into your home?

128
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,080
Princess, you are of noble birth.

129
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,480
My home is humble.

130
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,520
How could I let you

131
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,520
It's not humble, not at all.

132
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,680
It's much more interesting than my Xichun Garden.

133
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,120
I swear here and now,

134
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,160
if I step out of Rui Manor,

135
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,360
may lightning strike me.

136
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,240
No.

137
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:42,880
Rui Yu

138
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,360
You tell me.

139
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,760
The Princess knows Chen Xiao's identity.

140
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,600
If she helps cover for you,

141
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,360
others won't dare to ask questions.

142
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,920
Everything will follow Your Majesty's orders.

143
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,120
Just this once.

144
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,360
If you cause trouble,

145
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,720
you'll never leave the palace again.

146
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,960
Then I won't marry.

147
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,720
Mother can't bear to part with you anyway.

148
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,360
I will be careful with my words and actions.

149
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,240
I won't cause any trouble.

150
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,840
You must also listen to Rui Yu.

151
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,920
If she tells you to go east,

152
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,120
you can't go west.

153
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,960
No problem.

154
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,320
I'll go pack my things now.

155
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,760
See you tomorrow, Rui Yu.

156
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,280
Take care, Princess.

157
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,440
It's all because of your second brother.

158
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,080
My little sister

159
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,000
keeps coming up with more tricks.

160
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,720
If Your Majesty lets the Princess leave,

161
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,040
she'll see my second brother even more often.

162
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,080
I don't care.

163
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,800
Any trouble you cause

164
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,200
must be cleaned up for me.

165
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,240
I obey Your Majesty's command.

166
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,360
Be careful not to bump into anything.

167
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,880
This is fine redwood.

168
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,240
I brought all these from the palace.

169
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,120
Be careful, everyone.

170
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,480
I'm not hard to please.

171
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,200
As long as you do well,

172
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,280
you'll all be rewarded.

173
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:55,760
Yes, yes.

174
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,560
Princess

175
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,200
Our place is small.

176
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,960
We can't host someone as grand as you.

177
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,120
Rui Manor is so big,

178
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,360
but only you and Rui Yu live here.

179
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,800
Isn't it boring?

180
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,280
One more person won't matter.

181
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,200
The Princess staying here

182
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,840
is your greatest honor.

183
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,360
The Princess left the palace without permission

184
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,080
and moved into a minister's home.

185
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,720
How can my family explain this to the court?

186
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:20,920
Yes.

187
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,320
This is an imperial decree.

188
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,640
Rise.

189
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,640
Just know I have royal permission.

190
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,800
Rui Yu

191
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,240
Greetings, Princess.

192
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,320
Why has the Princess come?

193
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,680
And brought so many things?

194
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,560
Looks like the Princess plans to stay long.

195
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,400
Be careful, everyone.

196
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,640
What should we do?

197
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,560
Princess

198
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,960
If you need anything,

199
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,360
just tell the steward.

200
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,520
No problem at all.

201
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,800
Where is Rui Wang?

202
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,560
Rui Wang

203
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,480
He lives at the main house.

204
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,480
He doesn't visit here often.

205
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,320
That's not right.

206
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,520
You two are brothers.

207
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,880
You should see each other often.

208
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,600
So,

209
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,840
starting tomorrow,

210
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,520
have him come here for meals every day.

211
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,080
If I happen to be

212
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,680
in a good mood,

213
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,720
I'll even cook myself.

214
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,480
Princess

215
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,480
Don't tell me you like the second brother.

216
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,440
How could I like someone bad

217
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:20,680
and unreasonable?

218
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,520
So much fine timber.

219
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:28,920
Yes.

220
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,280
It wasn't easy to transport, was it?

221
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,680
This is quite a large amount.

222
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,080
It'll take a while to count it all.

223
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,600
How about the payment for this batch—

224
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,560
we settle it tomorrow instead?

225
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,000
That wouldn't be proper.

226
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,960
This isn't like other goods.

227
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,200
You can't just store it at the post station.

228
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,360
Except for our warehouse,

229
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,800
nowhere else can hold it.

230
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,040
If you're really worried,

231
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,760
tonight you can—

232
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:48,760
No, no, no.

233
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,120
Let's do as you suggested.

234
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,880
That's the right way.

235
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,320
Tonight,

236
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,880
I'll get you some good food and drinks.

237
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,440
Right?

238
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,680
I know all the best places to eat and have fun in Ling An.

239
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,080
I'm the most familiar here.

240
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,560
Let's go.

241
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,320
Alright.

242
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,560
How did a perfectly fine warehouse

243
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,720
end up catching fire?

244
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,520
How do you people handle things?

245
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,680
Are you all just useless eaters?

246
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,560
Why isn't Rui Yu back yet?

247
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,520
Father.

248
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,920
Stop pacing in front of me.

249
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,040
Rui Yu went to the palace to report.

250
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,680
Why didn't you go with her?

251
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:23,680
Father.

252
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,480
What status do I have?

253
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,640
How could I enter the palace?

254
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,000
That's why you're useless.

255
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,720
You can't earn a title.

256
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,280
Now we can only rely on Rui Yu.

257
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:31,720
Yes.

258
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,840
I'm useless.

259
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,080
Father.

260
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,560
Calm down.

261
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,520
There's still a chance to turn things around.

262
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,600
It's already dark.

263
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,600
Rui Yu has been at the palace all day.

264
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,640
We still don't know

265
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,840
how much scolding she's endured.

266
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,160
If your mother is watching from above,

267
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,560
and knew about this,

268
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,840
she'd be heartbroken.

269
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:57,800
Rui Yu.

270
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,400
Father.

271
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,080
Everyone's here.

272
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,600
Saves me from calling you all from each courtyard.

273
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,600
How did it go?

274
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,480
Rui Yu.

275
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,680
Why are your hands so cold?

276
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,600
I caught a chill on the way.

277
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,000
It's nothing serious.

278
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,240
Rui Yu.

279
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,440
You weren't scolded by Your Majesty, were you?

280
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,200
Rui Yu.

281
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,880
About the warehouse fire—

282
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,600
how was it handled?

283
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,120
This matter

284
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,000
started with the Rui family

285
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,760
and must end with the Rui family.

286
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,840
As long as the Rui family pays

287
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,600
this sum,

288
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,320
the account will be settled.

289
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,320
Settle the account?

290
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,360
How much will that cost?

291
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,160
Three hundred taels.

292
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,520
Three hundred taels?

293
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,000
How could it be so cheap?

294
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,920
Gold.

295
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,080
Gold?

296
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,400
Father, father!

297
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,680
Father, are you alright?

298
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,520
Are you okay?

299
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,080
How is he?

300
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,880
Seriously,

301
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,400
we'll have to tighten our belts.

302
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,440
We'll dismiss some servants

303
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,480
to cut costs.

304
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,520
Father's

305
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,360
and elder brother's collections

306
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,840
must all be pawned.

307
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,120
Then,

308
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,280
we'll scrape together some silver from the palace.

309
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,520
Only then can we settle the account.

310
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,640
If we can resolve this,

311
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,600
that would be good.

312
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,080
Let's go back and pack up.

313
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,960
Tomorrow, together with the family collections,

314
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,560
we'll sell them all.

315
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,960
Go on.

316
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,240
Father.

317
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,000
Go ahead.

318
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,280
Let's go, let's head back.

319
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,680
It's truly hard to bear.

320
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,200
I was terrified when Father almost collapsed.

321
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,000
But

322
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,920
if Father and elder brother knew the truth,

323
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,880
they'd never let us go through with it.

324
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,680
You two

325
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,800
acted pretty well just now.

326
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,560
I almost couldn't hold it together.

327
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,760
Why were you in the palace so long?

328
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,240
I could barely keep Father calm.

329
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,840
We had to put on a show.

330
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,720
I'll leave the pawning to you.

331
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,400
Rui Yu,

332
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,840
I'm still your elder brother, aren't I?

333
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,560
When you ask for help,

334
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,600
you should at least act like you need it.

335
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,320
Is it so hard to call me Second Brother?

336
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,080
Here we go again.

337
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,480
It's just a title.

338
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,600
Or do you want to be the elder sister?

339
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,480
Me?

340
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,600
Why not?

341
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,040
Forget it, forget it.

342
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,800
You can trust me to handle it.

343
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:53,600
As the saying goes,

344
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,440
plan in the command tent,

345
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,080
win battles a thousand miles away.

346
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,360
Besides,

347
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,040
we're just going through the motions.

348
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,240
It's all for show.

349
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,920
The money and deeds will end up back with us.

350
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,360
It's a good chance

351
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,400
to take the old man

352
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,000
and elder brother's useless trinkets

353
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,920
and confiscate them all.

354
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,120
The house will be peaceful for a few days.

355
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,200
But handling this so easily—

356
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,480
don't you suspect Sister-in-law?

357
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,560
I keep thinking Pan Zi Zhai is behind this.

358
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,480
What he dislikes most

359
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,080
is Ling An and Pingxiang getting along.

360
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,400
He hasn't visited our residence in days.

361
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,280
Now that we're in trouble,

362
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,600
we can close our doors to guests.

363
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,520
Just cut off contact.

364
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,840
What are you doing?

365
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,400
I asked Fu Lv to help me with my makeup.

366
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,520
So I look a bit more worn out.

367
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,080
You little rascal.

368
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,040
Too bad I can't get a closer look.

369
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,120
This girl...

370
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,680
Her skills have slipped lately.

371
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,280
Stop messing around.

372
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,560
Rui Yu and I

373
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,840
just tried out

374
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,080
disguise techniques.

375
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:09,800
Enough.

376
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:10,960
Go back quickly.

377
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,560
Or they'll start getting suspicious.

378
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:14,880
Alright.

379
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,080
We'll leave now and come back tomorrow morning.

380
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,440
Go on.

381
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,440
Let's go.

382
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,360
Go.

383
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:22,560
We're leaving.

384
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,080
Your Majesty.

385
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,240
What's so urgent?

386
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,160
The warehouse storing the timber was burned.

387
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,400
Did you notify Pingxiang?

388
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,600
My eldest and second brothers have gone to calm things down.

389
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,120
The real timber

390
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,440
has already been secretly

391
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,480
moved to my residence by Chen Xiao.

392
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,960
Now all of Ling An knows

393
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,480
it was the Rui family's mistake

394
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,480
that led to the timber being destroyed.

395
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,360
It's the perfect time to stir things up.

396
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,360
How do you plan

397
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,040
to play your part in this drama?

398
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,680
Big brother,

399
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,240
there will be a chance in the future

400
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,440
to recover these items.

401
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,880
Don't let hobbies ruin your ambition.

402
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,120
From now on,

403
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,360
I'll help Lanzhi

404
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,760
and Steward Chen Xiao.

405
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,160
I'll teach the furniture to make craftsmen—

406
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:47,960
No,

407
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,040
teach craftsmen to make furniture.

408
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,080
I'll try

409
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,840
to earn a chance to make up for my mistakes.

410
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,320
It's good that you think this way.

411
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Family matters

412
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,200
aren't your concern.

413
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,360
Three hundred taels of gold

414
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,600
to bring you back to your senses—

415
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,400
I wonder if it's worth it.

416
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,680
Of course it's worth it.

417
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,880
As long as we work together as a family,

418
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,120
we'll earn it back.

419
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:14,960
The sun is blazing.

420
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,880
You should hurry back and rest.

421
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,400
You two sure have a lot of stuff.

422
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,520
You only brought one bundle.

423
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,600
All my things are at Rui Yu's place.

424
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,040
Besides,

425
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,360
only my boxes of storybooks are worth anything.

426
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,400
Let's all disperse.

427
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,960
Rui Yu has worked hard.

428
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,600
So has my brother and sister-in-law.

429
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,440
Rui Yu has left.

430
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,880
With the Rui family like this now,

431
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,640
we'll have to tighten our belts and pretend.

432
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,440
It's hard on you.

433
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,680
Don't say that.

434
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,320
We as husband and wife

435
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,480
share honor together,

436
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,560
and loss together.

437
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,120
Besides,

438
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,680
this isn't a big deal.

439
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,040
Rui Yu's courtyard

440
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,400
is really huge, isn't it?

441
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,200
Yes.

442
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:15,760
Look,

443
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,720
it'd be nice to put some flowers here.

444
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,840
It's too plain, nothing here.

445
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,280
Look at this wood carving.

446
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:20,800
It's too plain.

447
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,120
Yes, not as good as big brother's carving.

448
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:22,880
If I carved it—

449
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,400
You scared me, you really scared me!

450
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,760
Brother Rui Wang!

451
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,400
Prin—

452
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,000
Who is this?

453
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,280
You're the eldest brother?

454
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,280
Who are you?

455
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,360
Who?

456
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,960
She doesn't look like a maid.

457
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,400
She's Rui Yu's new concubine.

458
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,040
I am not!

459
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,960
She's Princess Chunxi.

460
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:45,880
Greetings, Princess.

461
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,200
I—

462
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,400
Never mind, big brother, no need for formalities.

463
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,560
I'm just staying here for now.

464
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,200
While I'm here, keep things simple.

465
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:53,960
No need to be formal.

466
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,160
Alright.

467
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,120
Why did you leave the palace to live here?

468
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,480
Why are you dressed like this?

469
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,240
Why are you all asking me?

470
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,840
Didn't your storybooks say

471
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,520
a princess with weak Ba Zi

472
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,520
can stay at a minister's house with strong Ba Zi?

473
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,840
I just asked Qin Tian Jian to check for me.

474
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,200
And I heard you were coming,

475
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,000
so I—

476
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,440
I made all that up!

477
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,680
But I asked Wanwan,

478
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,720
she said a princess did this in the previous dynasty, so I—

479
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,440
What,

480
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,400
are you angry?

481
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,840
If the Princess is willing to stay with us,

482
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,240
it's the greatest honor for the Rui family.

483
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,880
From now on, we'll be family.

484
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,560
Don't you think so?

485
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,600
What family?

486
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,440
Is it proper to say that to the Princess?

487
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,600
Why not?

488
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,520
I get it now.

489
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,960
You just don't want to see me.

490
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:38,560
Let's go.

491
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,880
Pack up, we're leaving now.

492
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,680
It's not that I don't want to.

493
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,280
Princess.

494
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,240
What are you looking at? Go after her!

495
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,760
Why should I chase her?

496
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,960
She wants to return to the palace.

497
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,160
That's a good thing.

498
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,000
I say you're thick-headed.

499
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,760
Aren't you usually smart?

500
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,560
Why can't you figure this out now?

501
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,400
I know this better than you.

502
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,000
This—

503
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,920
Isn't this a mismatch of status?

504
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:03,800
Take it.

505
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,440
No.

506
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,920
I must owe him from a past life.

507
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,200
This Rui family, inside and out,

508
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,400
not a single one is easy.

509
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,520
Without me, this family would've fallen apart.

510
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,440
Your Highness

511
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,640
The Rui family, to make up for the timber loss,

512
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,720
sold a large number of antiques and paintings.

513
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,680
I heard

514
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,800
Rui Yu was scolded all day yesterday
by Your Majesty of Ling An.

515
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,360
It was quite embarrassing.

516
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,880
Those items the Rui family sold—

517
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,040
Would Your Highness like to buy them?

518
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:56,720
No need.

519
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,240
When I

520
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,960
become Prince Qian Yuan,

521
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,800
getting her, a woman,

522
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,160
will be a piece of cake.

523
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,600
But I should pay them a visit.

524
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,560
The Rui family has closed their doors to guests.

525
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,240
I heard the princess is staying at the Rui residence.

526
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,000
Miss Ming tried to visit but was refused.

527
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,560
Why did this news arrive so late?

528
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,520
I only heard when I visited Minister Ming at the Ming residence.

529
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,880
Keep a close watch on the Rui residence.

530
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,760
Any news,

531
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,600
report to me at once.

532
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,440
Yes, Your Highness.

533
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:47,960
Go.

534
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,120
Travel permit.

535
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:28,720
Go in.

536
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,000
Because of this,

537
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,400
you can rest at home for a few more days.

538
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,280
Who knows how much paperwork will pile up.

539
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,880
Just thinking about it gives me a headache.

540
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:57,880
Sir

541
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,560
Young Master

542
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,120
The general suddenly reported

543
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,960
that several people dressed in Western attire

544
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,600
tried to enter the city without a permit.

545
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,560
They clashed with the city guards.

546
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,560
People from the Western border?

547
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,400
Yes.

548
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,880
At this time of year,

549
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,200
Wu Rong and Da Yue are fighting over water sources.

550
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,520
Why would they suddenly visit Ling An?

551
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,320
Maybe

552
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,800
they ended their conflict early.

553
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,680
Quick, help me change.

554
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,800
I need to go to the palace.

555
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,800
I'll call Liang Jin.

556
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:25,960
Come here.

557
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,960
Why are you in such a rush?

558
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,000
Hurry up.

559
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,960
Why are you here?

560
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:34,840
Brother Nan

561
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,480
Rui Yu asked me

562
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,960
to deliver the checkpoint map for the route.

563
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,320
Let's go.

564
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,400
Let's catch up properly.

565
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,080
Alright.

566
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,880
That sly fox only knows how to bully people.

567
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,120
And I just can't win an argument with you.

568
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,440
Darn it, I'm so mad.

569
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,520
Princess, what's wrong?

570
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,160
Do you really not know how I feel?

571
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,320
Fine, I'll leave.

572
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,920
I don't care if we never meet again.

573
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,920
Rouge not evenly blended,

574
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,000
idle flowers with a faint scent.

575
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,000
You look beautiful even without makeup.

576
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,840
Why are you arranging these flowers in the courtyard?

577
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,120
They say this is called the Cold Fragrance Pavilion,

578
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,480
but there isn't a single flower.

579
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,840
That's really not fitting.

580
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,800
But

581
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,560
I'm going back to the palace.

582
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,440
Go back if you want.

583
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,240
If you leave, I'll move in.

584
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,880
I don't want to live next to my big brother anyway.

585
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,560
He's so noisy.

586
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,240
You just have to annoy me, don't you?

587
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,800
It's really inconvenient for you to stay here.

588
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,360
What if you accidentally say something you shouldn't?

589
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,760
Wouldn't that cause trouble for Chen Xiao?

590
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,480
After all, you still—

591
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,760
No, I don't like him.

592
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,560
I only liked the character in your storybook.

593
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,320
How could I like someone so fierce?

594
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,320
If you don't want to leave,

595
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,680
then maybe I should consider

596
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,480
putting up with my big brother.

597
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,800
If I stay here,

598
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,880
will you be happy?

599
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,160
I...

600
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,960
Of course I'd be happy.

601
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,320
If that's the case,

602
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,080
then this princess will stay.

603
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,880
What kind of flowers are these?

604
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,600
They smell wonderful.

605
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,200
Do you like them?

606
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,760
I do.

607
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:27,640
I'm hungry.

608
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,320
Let's go.

609
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,360
I'll take you to get something to eat.

610
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,600
Let's go.

611
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,240
King Wu Rong and Princess Wu Rong request an audience.

612
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,600
Your Majesty of Ling An

613
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,240
Just as the rumors said,

614
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,000
young and accomplished indeed.

615
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,680
The Prince of Wu Rong visits Ling An

616
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,200
for what purpose?

617
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,080
I have come in person

618
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,000
to search for a certain young man.

619
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,160
He is an honored guest of Wu Rong

620
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,840
and Princess Mu Ya's husband.

621
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,000
Moreover,

622
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,400
he is the general who brings fortune to Wu Rong.

623
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,520
But I do not know his full name.

624
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,840
Why is he in Ling An's capital?

625
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,280
His name is

626
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,600
Bei Cheng.

627
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:27,800
Bei.

628
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,840
He told me

629
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,880
his home is in Ling An's capital.

630
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,760
As for his age,

631
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,800
he looks about twenty-four or twenty-five.

632
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,360
If not for our conflict with Da Yue,

633
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,640
he would not have been ambushed by Da Yue.

634
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,800
He would not have

635
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,760
fled toward Ling An's capital.

636
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,880
Ling An has countless talented youths.

637
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,160
With just these clues,

638
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,120
it will be hard to find him.

639
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,960
You only need to announce

640
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,240
that my sister, Princess Mu Ya of Wu Rong,

641
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,880
is seeking her fiancé, General Bei Cheng.

642
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,360
I believe

643
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,240
news will come soon.

644
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,000
Also,

645
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,600
I came to Ling An

646
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,000
to fulfill my promise to him.

647
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,280
I have come in person

648
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,960
to sign an alliance with Ling An.

649
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,280
Hearing the Prince of Wu Rong,

650
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,640
this Bei Cheng,

651
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,400
must truly be a remarkable talent.

652
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,160
Are you not afraid I won't let him go?

653
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,080
We Wu Rong people travel far and wide.

654
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,920
We've seen all kinds of situations.

655
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,920
I came in person

656
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,240
to show

657
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,400
my

658
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,240
respect for General Bei Cheng

659
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,200
and

660
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,320
my sincerity

661
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,000
in forming an alliance with Ling An.

662
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,440
Prince of Wu Rong, do not worry.

663
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,240
If it's just searching for someone,

664
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,760
Ling An will gladly help.

665
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,000
If he cannot achieve here in Ling An,

666
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,000
he may succeed in Wu Rong.

667
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,720
An alliance between Wu Rong and Ling An

668
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,480
benefits both our nations.

669
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,520
I ask Your Majesty to give it your attention.

670
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:06,880
Very well.

671
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,280
Since you are here,

672
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,040
please settle in and rest.

673
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,480
Once you are refreshed,

674
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,640
I will ask Lord Rui

675
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,880
to show you around the capital.

676
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,000
How does that sound?

677
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,320
I've never lost my way on the endless grasslands.

678
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,840
In this square city of Ling An,

679
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,120
how could I possibly get lost?

680
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Since Your Majesty insists,

681
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,840
we'll trouble Lord Rui then.

682
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,520
But we've traveled for days and are tired.

683
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,760
Would a few days later be alright?

684
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,400
Princess, you are too polite.

685
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,040
Then on another day,

686
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,240
I'll come to the Four Directions Hall to fetch you.

687
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,280
Bei Cheng

688
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,680
I did not know

689
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,080
Ling An had such a talent.

690
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,400
Lord Rui,

691
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,800
arrange for people at once

692
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,200
to search for Bei Cheng.

693
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,720
Continue alliance talks as planned.

694
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,080
If he truly cannot be found,

695
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,520
it must not affect our alliance.

696
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:15,840
Yes, Your Majesty.

697
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,840
I will go prepare immediately.

698
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,640
I will do my utmost to find

699
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,040
Bei Cheng.

700
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,520
Just tell me.

701
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,760
Hurry, tell me!

702
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,080
See, I've been following you all along.

703
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,160
Why won't you tell me?

704
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,880
I've been talking all morning.

705
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,760
My throat is already sore.

706
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,320
What more do you want me to say?

707
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,000
So boring.

708
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,000
Young Master Nan,

709
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,840
why not teach me boxing?

710
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,640
Then I can protect myself outside.

711
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,600
Let Second Brother teach you.

712
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,680
You know martial arts?

713
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,240
I've traveled everywhere,

714
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,560
so I learned some self-defense.

715
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,920
But it's all just basics.

716
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,840
I can't really teach you.

717
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:02,760
I don't believe you.

718
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,960
You love to lie.

719
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,360
Come on, let's go to the training ground.

720
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,400
Princess, I'm not lying.

721
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,800
I only know a little.

722
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,000
Why are you back so soon?

723
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,240
The Prince of Wu Rong didn't trouble you, right?

724
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:13,960
No.

725
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,280
They just said they're looking for someone.

726
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,360
They came to Ling An for this person.

727
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,520
Who is it?

728
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,120
To make the Prince of Wu Rong mobilize like this?

729
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,600
They said it's a general named Bei Cheng.

730
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,400
I've been an official for years,

731
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,960
but never heard of this name.

732
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,440
Bei Cheng?

733
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,760
Do you know him?

734
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,440
No.

735
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,200
I just think the name is odd.

736
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,880
They also said

737
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,600
General Bei Cheng is Princess Mu Ya's husband.

738
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,000
He went missing after being attacked.

739
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,600
That's all the clues they gave.

740
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,280
How am I supposed to help them find him?

741
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,600
Maybe they won't find him

742
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,520
and just leave.

743
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,520
I'm afraid it won't be that easy.
