1
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,160
What should we do with him?

2
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,640
Take him away.

3
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,120
Kneel down.

4
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,200
Sir.

5
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,080
Minister Ming.

6
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,680
Child trafficking, selling offices,
forgery, slander—

7
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,560
These three major crimes together.

8
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,840
This violates our nation's laws.

9
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:14,960
You—

10
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,240
Do you admit your guilt?

11
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,000
Minister Liu.

12
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,800
I don't understand what you mean.

13
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,520
These ledgers were seized from your home.

14
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,360
Are you still trying to deny it?

15
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,200
And—

16
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,120
This ink-erasing potion—

17
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,600
You used it to frame General Qiao.

18
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,720
Evidence of illegal money lending.

19
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,160
I confiscated these

20
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,640
during the search.

21
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,120
They were meant

22
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,400
to convict He Zhaoyin.

23
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,520
I didn't expect

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,920
Minister Liu would discover it first.

25
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,560
This matter—

26
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,640
What does it have to do with He Zhaoyin?

27
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,840
Minister Liu is still young.

28
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,400
These matters—

29
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,160
I've investigated for a long time.

30
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,840
The evidence is solid.

31
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,040
Since

32
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,840
Minister Liu is eager for merit,

33
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,320
then I

34
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,080
will go along with it.

35
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,800
This is the culprit's confession.

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,360
Minister Liu, please keep it safe.

37
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,000
So Minister Ming admits

38
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,200
the fisher girl's case

39
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,480
and the illegal lending case

40
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,200
were both misjudged?

41
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,040
Anyone can make mistakes.

42
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,000
We should at least ask about it.

43
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,200
I ordered it done.

44
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,360
That is

45
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,680
in accordance with protocol.

46
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,160
Isn't that right, Minister Rui?

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,800
Yes.

48
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,320
I just didn't expect

49
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,280
Minister Ming to cut ties so quickly.

50
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,840
How can you call it

51
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,600
cutting ties?

52
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,440
It makes me look

53
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,560
like I'm forming factions.

54
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,480
Isn't that so,

55
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,560
Minister Liu?

56
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,440
About He Zhaoyin—

57
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,000
Please

58
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,280
investigate further.

59
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,200
If there's nothing else,

60
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,040
I'll return to rest.

61
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:38,960
Ming Qiuhai.

62
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,200
How dare you!

63
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:43,760
Sir.

64
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,160
He Zhaoyin hanged himself at home.

65
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,480
Minister Liu, is there anything else?

66
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,400
Nothing.

67
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You all may leave.

68
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:28,720
Get up.

69
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,160
Go.

70
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,200
He Zhaoyin—

71
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,320
hanged himself at home.

72
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,800
And—

73
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,920
he left a confession letter.

74
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,000
He said all of this

75
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,720
was his doing.

76
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,640
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,520
I couldn't help you.

78
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm glad the two generals were cleared.

79
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,640
When can they be released?

80
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,160
Leave it to me.

81
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,880
In three days.

82
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,560
Thank you.

83
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,640
Your Majesty.

84
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,480
Princess Chunxi has arrived.

85
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,440
Second Young Master Rui entered the palace too.

86
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:32,920
Yes.

87
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:33,960
Your humble servant—

88
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,640
came to escort the princess back.

89
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,440
Royal brother—

90
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,360
I brought you buns from outside.

91
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,600
Would you like to try one?

92
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,600
If you hadn't said so, I'd have forgotten.

93
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,320
Princess Chunxi is getting bold now.

94
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,960
Her token was confiscated,

95
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,760
yet she still left the palace.

96
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,400
Don't be angry, royal brother.

97
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,000
Li Quan.

98
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:01,920
Yes.

99
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,080
Assign someone to watch the princess.

100
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,320
After copying the Diamond Sutra ten times,

101
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,520
send it to the Empress Dowager's palace.

102
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,520
It's for the Empress Dowager's meditation.

103
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,640
Show some filial piety.

104
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,800
Ten times? That's too much!

105
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,400
Twenty times.

106
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,160
Twenty times.

107
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,240
Ten times, ten times, ten times!

108
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,320
Your sister takes her leave.

109
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,680
Go, go, go.

110
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,080
Yes.

111
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,040
Young master.

112
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,320
Your Highness, wait for this old servant!

113
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,280
Master Rui.

114
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,880
Are you enjoying the festivities?

115
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,720
Very much.

116
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:32,800
No—

117
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,120
How could a humble servant dare?

118
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,800
I'll take my leave now.

119
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,000
Go ahead.

120
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,880
I take my leave.

121
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,480
Why isn't she back yet?

122
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,200
Sir, sir!

123
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,360
Where is Madam?

124
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,120
I went to find Second Young Master.

125
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,920
He said he met Madam in the east alley this afternoon.

126
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,560
Then they parted ways.

127
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,000
He said Madam went after someone.

128
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,880
I checked the teahouse and tavern he frequents.

129
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,040
I searched them all.

130
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,080
Couldn't find her.

131
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,760
Not bad skills.

132
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,640
Too bad he's a petty thief.

133
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,880
Taking advantage of others.

134
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,920
Utterly shameless.

135
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,840
You're just a coward who bullies kids.

136
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,920
If my royal brother hadn't spared you,

137
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,480
for kidnapping little Chongguang,

138
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,240
I'd have cut you to pieces long ago.

139
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,040
Kidnapping—

140
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,640
You'll stay in Wurong forever,

141
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,960
as a slave.

142
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,320
I—

143
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,920
Why are you here?

144
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,320
Second Young Master.

145
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,240
I'm Qiuhong, the princess's maid.

146
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,000
The princess asked me to give this to you.

147
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,560
Thank you.

148
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,240
Why didn't you

149
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,800
knock and come inside to talk?

150
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,640
The princess said

151
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,000
she snuck out of the palace

152
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,480
and caused you all a lot of trouble.

153
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,040
She told me not to disturb anyone here.

154
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,400
If you have something to say to her,

155
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,880
I can pass the message for you.

156
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,280
I...

157
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,960
It's nothing.

158
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,440
Yes.

159
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,320
Please tell her for me:

160
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,320
When she can leave the palace,

161
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,160
I'll take her

162
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,240
to eat grilled fish.

163
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,400
Okay.

164
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,840
Bad fox.

165
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,160
I left the palace without permission

166
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,160
and my brother made me copy scriptures.

167
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,720
The New Year is coming.

168
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,040
I'm afraid I won't get to see you again soon.

169
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,520
I have to wait until after the fifteenth to ask him to let me out.

170
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,280
I've been reading the Scenery Collection lately

171
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,200
and realized there are many sights I haven't seen.

172
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,200
Someday,

173
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,800
will you take me to see the vast mountains and rivers?

174
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,040
This cloak is my thank-you gift to you.

175
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,040
And about Brother Chenxiao,

176
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,200
please help me apologize to him.

177
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,400
I'm the one who caused you trouble.

178
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,920
Please don't forget me.

179
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,760
I'll find a chance to come out for sure.

180
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,640
Yanluo.

181
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,240
What a fateful mess.

182
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,960
It's been three days.

183
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,880
Any news of Chenxiao?

184
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,160
I'm about to go to the Hidden Pavilion for updates.

185
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,840
At the city gates these days,

186
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,960
among the passing merchants,

187
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,040
there's no sign of him.

188
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,680
But a Wurong caravan left the capital.

189
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,720
I've sent people to investigate along the way.

190
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,080
Wait a bit longer for news.

191
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,720
Yu'er.

192
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,000
Yu'er.

193
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,520
It's gotten cold lately.

194
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,920
Have Liangjin prepare a hand warmer for you every day.

195
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,040
Second Brother,

196
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,640
if there's any news,

197
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,880
please let me know right away.

198
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,120
Don't worry.

199
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,920
I'll tell you as soon as I hear anything.

200
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,240
Alright.

201
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,880
Okay.

202
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,280
I'm really useless.

203
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,960
You all don't need to keep working.

204
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,160
Go celebrate the New Year.

205
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,680
Thank you, Madam.

206
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,920
Thank you, Master.

207
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,120
Happy New Year!

208
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,160
Go on, everyone.

209
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:22,720
Go on, everyone.

210
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,040
Thank you, Madam.

211
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:23,720
Go, go.

212
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,280
You all go too.

213
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:24,520
Dad.

214
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:24,680
It's New Year.

215
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,040
Come on.

216
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,520
Let's set off fireworks.

217
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,240
Lan Zhi and I

218
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,120
wish you a happy New Year.

219
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,960
Here, Dad.

220
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,560
May you live as long as the southern pine.

221
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,440
May everything go smoothly next year.

222
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:33,920
Here's to you.

223
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,200
Here, Dad.

224
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,200
Good, good, I'll take your good wishes.

225
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,400
Alright.

226
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,320
Come, come.

227
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:42,840
Thank you, Dad.

228
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:43,960
And here's a red envelope.

229
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:44,880
Thank you, Dad.

230
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,360
This one's for Lan Zhi.

231
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,040
These are for you.

232
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,400
You handle the money, so you keep it.

233
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,320
This one's for Wang'er.

234
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,160
Thank you, Dad.

235
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,520
Yu'er.

236
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,640
Thank you, Dad.

237
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,320
Big Brother.

238
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,240
Where's the New Year's money for me and Yu'er?

239
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,720
What New Year's money?

240
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,320
You're too old for that now.

241
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,080
Besides,

242
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,240
I don't have any money.

243
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,200
Didn't the Ceremonial Office give you a share?

244
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,920
I remember Big Brother's share was one hundred.

245
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,720
Look, these chicken feet are delicious.

246
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,600
Hurry, have one, have one.

247
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,880
Have one, have one, have one.

248
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,400
I've only kept it warm for four hours.

249
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,160
Yu'er,

250
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,400
aren't you going to do something about him?

251
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,600
Even you, the eldest, can't handle him.

252
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,880
I'm just the third child.

253
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,080
How could I have that ability?

254
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,920
Why do I feel like something's off with you?

255
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:40,880
Nothing's wrong with me.

256
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,280
This year,

257
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,800
Yu'er is getting married.

258
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,160
Second brother,

259
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,800
when will you

260
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,240
do something serious?

261
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:50,920
You're right.

262
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,280
I...

263
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,000
In this whole house,

264
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,280
you're the only one without a wife.

265
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,080
Isn't that right, Dad?

266
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,680
That's right.

267
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,000
How did this end up about me?

268
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,080
Can we still eat in peace?

269
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,960
Good thing Chen Xiao is away on business this year.

270
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,240
If you don't get engaged next year,

271
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,440
you'll really be the only one left.

272
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,400
Sister-in-law,

273
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,760
you truly understand me.

274
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,560
Here, my lady, a toast to you.

275
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,160
With firecrackers, a year passes.

276
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,240
Spring breezes bring warmth to the wine.

277
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,040
I'll go set off some firecrackers.

278
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:22,840
You all,

279
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,200
who's coming with me?

280
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,480
I'll go with second brother.

281
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,080
Dad, we're heading out.

282
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:30,720
Go ahead.

283
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:31,880
We're not going.

284
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,720
We'll stay with Dad.

285
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,160
It's New Year's today.

286
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,040
We should all be lively.

287
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,040
And happy, too.

288
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:38,840
You all go ahead.

289
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,200
Dad said so.

290
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,120
Let's hurry and go.

291
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,080
Wait for us!

292
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:42,640
Yu'er!

293
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,640
Yu'er!

294
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,320
Brother Wang, you're here too!

295
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,600
Eat and drink well!

296
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,000
Abu!

297
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:39,840
Come on, Abu!

298
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,680
Come on, come on!

299
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:43,640
Brothers!

300
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,480
Cheers!

301
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,720
Alright, bottoms up!

302
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,280
No leaving till we're drunk!

303
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,440
Come!

304
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,880
I need to use the restroom.

305
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,080
You all keep drinking.

306
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,240
Hurry up!

307
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,240
Come on, come on!

308
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,080
Come on!

309
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,560
It's almost dawn.

310
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,160
They're still not resting.

311
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,760
The Wurong celebration

312
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,240
lasts until dawn the next day.

313
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,440
Shut up.

314
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,520
Brother Wang.

315
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,160
Kill for me!

316
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,600
If the Wurong King dies,

317
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,640
no one will restrain Dayue.

318
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,920
Ling'an's border will be devastated.

319
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,120
No way.

320
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:01,840
Brother Wang.

321
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,280
Are there guards outside the court?

322
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,000
Yes.

323
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,560
Go get soldiers.

324
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,320
Then, Brother Wang,

325
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:05,800
with me here,

326
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,720
he won't die.

327
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,320
Let's go.

328
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,680
Hurry, go!

329
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:23,720
Abu!

330
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,840
You traitor!

331
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,440
How dare you betray Wurong for Dayue!

332
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,880
This must be the antidote

333
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,160
for the little prince's poison.

334
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:48,720
Search!

335
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,800
See if anyone's alive.

336
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:50,560
Yes.

337
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,640
I failed to judge people well.

338
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,960
Sorry for your suffering, young master.

339
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,880
You helped me this time,

340
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,280
you're a benefactor to Wurong.

341
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,520
I still don't know

342
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,520
how to address you, young master.

343
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,560
My name is

344
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,280
Beicheng.

345
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,240
Young Master Beicheng,

346
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,280
I've offended you before.

347
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,560
Please don't take it to heart.

348
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:14,960
It was my fault.

349
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,480
The princess was deceived by traitors.

350
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,920
Now the misunderstanding is cleared.

351
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,840
I can return to Ling'an at ease.

352
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,120
You're leaving?

353
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,320
I've been gone for days.

354
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,800
My family must be worried.

355
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,360
Just escort me to Ling'an's gate.

356
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,960
The road back to Ling'an is dangerous.

357
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,520
Why not stay a few more days?

358
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,720
Wait for spring, then return.

359
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:39,920
It seems

360
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,760
the Wurong King won't let me go.

361
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,800
If I insist on leaving now,

362
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,080
I'm afraid...

363
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,440
Then may I write a letter home?

364
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,240
Well...

365
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,360
Wurong and Dayue

366
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,760
have fought over water for centuries.

367
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,040
Will you help me reclaim the water?

368
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,800
Wurong wants to monopolize the water.

369
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,040
We've never wanted to keep it all.

370
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,080
Water is a gift from heaven.

371
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,240
Monopolizing it

372
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,880
will only anger the heavens.

373
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,640
Water is the grassland's lifeblood.

374
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,480
If we can't reclaim it,

375
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,280
other Wurong tribes

376
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,920
will suffer greatly.

377
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,720
Didn't expect the Wurong King to be so just.

378
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,560
Fighting for innocent herders.

379
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,160
I must help with this.

380
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,120
I'll do my utmost to help.

381
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,280
It's always been survival of the fittest.

382
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,480
Young Master Beicheng is skilled.

383
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,280
And knows the art of war.

384
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,480
Surely,

385
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,440
you understand my meaning.

386
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,520
Take this chance to reclaim Dayue.

387
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,240
Strengthen Wurong.

388
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,480
That would be wonderful.

389
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,720
Be my general in Wurong then.

390
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,800
Wouldn't that be grand?

391
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,440
The Wurong King won't let me return.

392
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,120
Nor write a letter home.

393
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,840
He clearly has other plans.

394
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,480
Looks like I need another plan.

395
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,160
Father

396
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:18,800
Mother

397
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:19,840
Youyi

398
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,480
Lord Rui

399
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,000
Has my junior sister returned yet?

400
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,480
Not yet.

401
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,760
But she wrote me a letter.

402
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,440
She also bought many local specialties.

403
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,320
She asked me to bring them for you.

404
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,360
Why did Xiaoxiao suddenly leave the capital?

405
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,400
Mother

406
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,120
It's cold outside.

407
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,160
You're not well, don't catch a chill.

408
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,320
Let's talk inside.

409
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,760
Yes, madam.

410
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,480
Let's go in first.

411
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:50,520
Let's go.

412
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,040
Wanwan

413
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,640
Was there anything fun on New Year's Eve?

414
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,560
Tell me about it!

415
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,280
Everyone gathers at home on New Year's Eve.

416
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,560
The streets are empty.

417
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,120
There's really nothing interesting.

418
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,160
If Your Highness wants to have fun,

419
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,480
wait for the Lantern Festival.

420
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,760
That's when it's truly lively.

421
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,360
I thought this year would be different.

422
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,280
But I still have to wait for the festival.

423
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,360
Why aren't my brother and mother here yet?

424
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,400
I'm already hungry.

425
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,360
You...

426
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,200
As a princess,

427
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,760
you should sit properly.

428
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,360
Show some decorum.

429
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,960
Mother

430
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,280
Brother

431
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,440
Miss Ming has entered the palace again.

432
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,280
Your servant greets Your Majesty.

433
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,080
Empress Dowager

434
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,040
Wishing peace and harmony in the new year.

435
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,520
May this year surpass the last.

436
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,280
Please, sit.

437
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,400
Yes.

438
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,160
You...

439
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,280
If you could visit me more often,

440
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,960
that would be the best.

441
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,840
Yes, Wanwan.

442
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,440
You should come to the palace more.

443
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,680
Keep Mother company for me.

444
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,760
Mother is happier seeing you

445
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,880
than she is seeing me.

446
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,720
If you were as refined as Miss Ming,

447
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,480
I'd have much less to worry about.

448
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,200
The princess is so cheerful.

449
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,360
The Empress Dowager loves to make her smile.

450
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,240
Wanwan speaks so pleasantly.

451
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,760
Isn't that right, brother?

452
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,120
If Wanwan becomes the empress one day,

453
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,800
I will honor Mother.

454
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,640
Let's eat.

455
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,120
Wonderful! Mother was waiting for you to say that.

456
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,440
I couldn't ask you at the table earlier.

457
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,920
Since that day,

458
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,640
Chenxiao disappeared.

459
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,320
Where did he go?

460
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,560
Could it be

461
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,480
that something happened to him?

462
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,080
Father

463
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,640
I can only tell you this.

464
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,440
Please don't tell Mother.

465
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:01,920
Alright.

466
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,440
Go ahead.

467
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,840
I can handle it.

468
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,720
The Emperor and I

469
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,800
actually both know Chenxiao

470
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,080
is a man.
