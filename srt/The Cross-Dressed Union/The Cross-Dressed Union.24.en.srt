1
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,080
Young Master

2
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,440
Everything is packed up.

3
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,840
She'll look beautiful in this.

4
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,160
This time, I'm off to Pingxiang.

5
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,320
Chances are slim for my return.

6
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,840
If I truly don't make it back,

7
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,880
take this chest to the Rui Residence.

8
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,080
Give it to Rui Yu.

9
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,200
Won't you say goodbye in person?

10
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,480
These things—

11
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,080
It's better if you give them yourself.

12
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,000
A common man,

13
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,280
no noble am I,

14
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,240
how can I deserve a maiden

15
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,800
beyond compare?

16
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,200
To lose it was not my intent,

17
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,400
to keep it, my heart could not bear.

18
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,920
I have regrets,

19
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,680
but no remorse.

20
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,360
She is an ideal match.

21
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,120
I am not worthy.

22
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,000
Rui Yu.

23
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,600
Chenxiao.

24
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,560
Rui Yu.

25
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,080
Do I look good?

26
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,680
You do.

27
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,440
You look wonderful.

28
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,440
I've always wanted to see you.

29
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,960
Now, I've finally seen you.

30
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,480
I missed you so much.

31
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,240
But I don't have much time.

32
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,400
I have to go.

33
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,720
Where are you going?

34
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,200
Rui Yu.

35
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,840
Rui Yu.

36
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,560
Chenxiao.

37
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,560
Lord Liu.

38
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,080
You're doing well now.

39
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,080
Father.

40
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,720
You'll soon be the chief examiner for the Military Imperial Examination.

41
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,640
What we wanted to do

42
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,360
is about to come true.

43
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,960
Now,

44
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,760
everyone is doing well.

45
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,840
I,

46
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,240
Nan Chenxiao,

47
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,440
I missed you.

48
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,520
Didn't you say

49
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,720
you wanted to

50
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,840
be a real couple with me?

51
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,120
Are you not going to keep your word?

52
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,880
Are you really leaving me alone like this?

53
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,840
Say something.

54
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,440
Answer me.

55
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,440
Please, answer me.

56
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,520
Chenxiao.

57
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,520
Chenxiao.

58
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,600
You're awake!

59
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,480
Rui Yu.

60
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,120
I had such a long, long dream.

61
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,200
At the end of the dream,

62
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,320
we got separated.

63
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,080
But thankfully,

64
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,320
I didn't lose you.

65
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,320
You're still smiling.

66
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,200
I thought

68
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,320
you really wouldn't wake up.

69
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,320
You don't know

70
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,960
how worried I was.

71
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,760
Miss.

72
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,120
Miss is back!

73
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,960
Miss is back!

74
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,760
Miss is back!

75
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,840
Miss! Miss!

76
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,120
Miss.

77
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,280
Miss, this is wonderful!

78
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:07,960
Miss.

79
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,320
Nan Chenxiao.

80
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,520
Thank you.

81
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,320
Your Majesty.

82
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,120
Now, our dynasty has reinstated the Military Imperial Examination.

83
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,920
All the prefectures

84
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,520
have submitted the salary details for the military officials.

85
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,000
All are recorded in the register.

86
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,880
Presented to Your Majesty.

87
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:09,960
Your Majesty.

88
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,080
I have heard

89
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,000
Nan Chenxiao has awakened.

90
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,080
And recovered from his injuries.

91
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,200
Thank you for your concern, Your Majesty.

92
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,080
Nan Chenxiao is fully recovered.

93
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,000
Nan Chenxiao has rendered great service.

94
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,400
I shall grant him a first-rank official post.

95
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,240
Along with treasures and fine land,

96
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,160
the Ministry of Rites will prepare them

97
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,480
according to rank.

98
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,280
Send them to the Nan family to bring good fortune.

99
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,080
Thank you for Your Majesty's grace.

100
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,760
The late emperor once said,

101
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,080
military men grow arrogant with merit,

102
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,920
and their achievements may threaten the throne.

103
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,040
They may endanger royal authority.

104
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,440
Your Majesty,

105
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,200
please reconsider.

106
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:07,960
Your Majesty.

107
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,360
During the Border City rebellion,

108
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,320
Nan Chenxiao feared no strong foe.

109
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,480
He stayed calm before the rebels.

110
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,000
He commanded the troops wisely,

111
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,360
winning with fewer against many.

112
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,520
He reduced casualties among our soldiers

113
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,960
and secured our Ling An border.

114
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,360
He deterred those

115
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,640
with treacherous hearts against the nation.

116
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,280
They no longer dare

117
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,440
to shake our country's foundation.

118
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:30,920
In my opinion,

119
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,240
our dynasty lacks

120
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,960
talents like Nan Chenxiao,

121
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,440
who are seasoned and battle-tested.

122
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,240
Nan Chenxiao risked his life to protect us.

123
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,520
I believe he is loyal to the throne.

124
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,320
Such a meritorious subject—

125
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,200
if not rewarded,

126
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,400
I fear it will chill the hearts of the worthy.

127
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:48,680
Attendants!

128
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,320
Summon Nan Chenxiao to court.

129
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:52,880
Summon!

130
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,560
Nan Chenxiao, to the court!

131
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,040
Nan Chenxiao

132
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,760
Greetings, Your Majesty.

133
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:37,960
Rise.

134
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,400
Nan Chenxiao

135
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,280
This time at the Border City,

136
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,760
you risked your life to defend it.

137
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,160
And in Pingxiang,

138
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,280
you held the city alone.

139
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,320
Not yielding an inch.

140
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,360
Such integrity

141
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,920
and loyalty to the throne move me deeply.

142
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,040
Today, I

143
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,560
appoint you as Great General Zhenning.

144
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,920
You are excused from monthly court attendance.

145
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,000
You

146
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,280
shall focus on

147
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,760
training talented individuals for me,

148
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,280
and guard the capital.

149
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:04,800
Your servant

150
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,200
thanks Your Majesty for your great favor.

151
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,360
Your servant

152
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,600
will serve with utmost devotion,

153
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,000
never failing Your Majesty's trust.

154
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,640
Your Majesty chooses the worthy and able.

155
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,800
The Nan family now has two fierce generals.

156
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,440
This will be a tale for generations.

157
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,480
Now,

158
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,720
the two of you

159
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,880
have your status confirmed.

160
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,640
Then I

161
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,960
shall act as matchmaker once more.

162
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,000
I grant Great General Zhenning, Nan Chenxiao,

163
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:32,680
and

164
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,480
Rui Yu, daughter of former Hanlin Academician Rui Zhixu,

165
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,800
to be wed on an auspicious day.

166
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:41,880
Your servant

167
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,840
accepts the decree.

168
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:43,800
Thank you

169
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,200
for Your Majesty's grace.

170
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,920
Long live Your Majesty's wisdom.

171
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,240
Long live Your Majesty, ten thousand years!

172
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,920
Congratulations, Lord Nan!

173
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,400
Congratulations, Lord Nan!

174
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,560
Thank you, thank you!

175
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,360
Let’s keep in touch!

176
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,040
Congratulations, General Nan!

177
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,320
Please look after us!

178
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,080
Alright, alright.

179
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,840
General Nan

180
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,000
Congratulations!

181
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,320
That day at the Border City,

182
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,760
you fought bravely.

183
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,200
Your momentum was unstoppable.

184
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,160
From that moment,

185
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,440
I knew

186
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,240
you would earn the emperor’s favor.

187
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,840
Our Ling An

188
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,280
to have such a general

189
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,040
will surely prosper.

190
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,960
Exactly!

191
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,960
Thank you, Lord Liu.

192
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,360
I am new to officialdom.

193
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,720
I ask all of you

194
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,880
for your guidance.

195
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,520
Of course.

196
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,360
Thank you, everyone.

197
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,160
I must hurry back to prepare the betrothal gifts.

198
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,560
Alright, let’s meet again soon.

199
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,440
Understood.

200
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,280
Congratulations!

201
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,640
Congratulations, General Nan!

202
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,880
Left Chancellor

203
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,160
This color is so festive.

204
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,080
Add this accessory,

205
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,560
put them together,

206
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,040
the clothes will look wonderful.

207
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:07,960
Mother

208
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,640
Your Majesty has granted Rui Yu and me marriage again.

209
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:12,880
I am getting married.

210
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:13,880
Really?

211
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:14,600
You

212
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,360
You dare say that?

213
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,200
Rui Yu being a woman

214
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,560
was kept from us all along.

215
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,120
Today in court,

216
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,200
Rui Yu suddenly revealed

217
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,240
her true identity.

218
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,920
I was so shocked my heart nearly leapt out!

219
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:27,960
Do you know

220
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,240
if this isn’t handled well,

221
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,360
it’s a crime punishable by death!

222
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,400
Isn’t your son the same?

223
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:34,960
I...

224
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,560
I never thought

225
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,040
I’d live to drink tea served by my daughter-in-law.

226
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,200
Chenxiao

227
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,880
Now let me help you choose betrothal gifts.

228
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:53,720
Let’s go!

229
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,280
Come on!

230
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,520
Alright, Mother.

231
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,440
Let’s go!

232
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,680
Do you even care about me anymore?

233
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,240
Do I even matter at all?

234
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,680
Commoner Rui Wang

235
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,680
greets Your Majesty.

236
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:13,800
Rise.

237
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,160
Pingxiang’s affairs are settled.

238
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,760
The princess has returned safely to the palace.

239
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,280
I was honored to fulfill Your Majesty’s task.

240
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,320
Now,

241
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,920
I return the token.

242
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,600
That token was a reward from me.

243
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,920
That group of soldiers

244
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,160
was also given to you.

245
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,120
Your Majesty,

246
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,240
this...

247
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,080
You must hold an official post

248
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,160
to meet my expectations

249
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,760
and honor the Rui family’s name.

250
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:40,880
I have decided

251
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,720
to make an exception and appoint you

252
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,280
as Vice Minister of Personnel.

253
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,920
Oversee all officials for me.

254
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,160
This commoner

255
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,280
is unwilling.

256
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:52,720
Your servant

257
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,080
thanks Your Majesty for your grace.

258
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,120
Rise.

259
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,080
You’ve had a tiring journey.

260
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,360
Go home and rest.

261
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:03,840
Yes.

262
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:04,720
Your servant

263
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,600
takes his leave.

264
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,920
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

265
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,640
You have gained another loyal and capable minister.

266
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,800
Rui Yu, you truly are remarkable.

267
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,040
No matter in men's or women's attire,

268
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,520
you always look stunning.

269
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,040
Princess, you flatter me.

270
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,600
Miss,

271
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,760
the morning after tomorrow, you'll be wed.

272
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,920
These are jewelry from the First Young Madam
and Madam Nan.

273
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,920
Let's pick some out together.

274
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,240
There are so many.

275
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,120
I don't really know much about these.

276
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,160
How about

277
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,040
you choose for me?

278
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,120
That won't do.

279
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,680
You must pick jewelry that suits your own taste.

280
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,240
Don't worry too much.

281
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,560
Just choose what you like.

282
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,120
For a wedding,

283
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:13,880
this kind...

284
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,360
isn't it too plain?

285
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,680
Rui Yu,

286
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,880
getting married is the happiest event.

287
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,440
You should be more festive.

288
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,440
Look at this one.

289
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,840
This is so beautiful.

290
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,760
Look, everyone.

291
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,400
I think so too.

292
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,440
It's very pretty.

293
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,160
There are some ornate ones.

294
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,160
How about

295
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,960
trying the phoenix crown set
from the groom?

296
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,360
Phoenix crown?

297
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,480
Which one is the phoenix crown?

298
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,560
Go, go, go!

299
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,040
You all,

300
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:55,560
get out!

301
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,560
You can't come in.

302
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,280
What's going on?

303
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,920
Why are you all here?

304
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,400
Princess,

305
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,000
Big brother,

306
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,560
Second brother,

307
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,400
Young Master Nan,

308
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,800
You and my sister aren't married yet.

309
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,120
Calling her so intimately

310
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,360
isn't proper, is it?

311
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,840
Didn't you call her that before?

312
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,600
Why is it suddenly improper now?

313
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,600
The rule is, you can't meet before marriage.

314
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,480
Acting like a rogue, as Young Master Nan does,

315
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,440
is that appropriate?

316
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,400
We haven't seen each other for over half a month.

317
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,120
Let me just take a look.

318
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:33,920
No.

319
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,960
Then can I speak to her through the door?

320
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,000
No.

321
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,320
Stop making a fuss, all of you.

322
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,680
This is the women's quarters.

323
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,840
Do you have any manners?

324
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:45,800
Do you?

325
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:47,800
I'm just...

326
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,960
Our Miss said

327
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,400
to act with propriety and caution.

328
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,600
Not meeting before marriage is tradition.

329
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,200
It's the rule.

330
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,040
It can't be broken.

331
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,800
Young Master Nan, please leave.

332
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,960
Did you hear that?

333
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,040
Act with propriety and caution.

334
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,120
Go back, quickly.

335
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,560
Why is it different from before?

336
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,360
Back to your real status.

337
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,120
Is the difference that big?

338
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,320
You brat,

339
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,800
wanting to marry my sister,

340
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,000
and you still dare to act shamelessly!

341
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,440
Before I see Rui Yu,

342
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,560
I won't leave.

343
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:17,880
That won't work.

344
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,120
Big brother,

345
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,040
can you beat him?

346
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,040
Isn't that obvious?

347
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,160
Of course I can't.

348
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,480
But I'm the big brother, after all.

349
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:25,640
Besides,

350
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:26,840
if I hit him,

351
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,760
would he dare fight back?

352
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,480
I'm warning you.

353
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,040
What?

354
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,200
I won't go easy on you.

355
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,080
I really am...

356
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,720
Then don't marry my sister.

357
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,200
Tomorrow I'll go to the palace

358
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,600
and ask Your Majesty to revoke the decree.

359
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,080
That's right.

360
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,880
Fine, I admit I was wrong, okay?

361
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:45,920
Big brothers,

362
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,160
I'm leaving now.

363
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,080
Hurry up and go.

364
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,600
That way.

365
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,600
Stop looking.

366
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,160
Two brother-in-laws...

367
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,480
Life won't be easy from now on.

368
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,600
Big brother knows.

369
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,880
Let him burn my firewood.

370
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,640
Princess, slow down!

371
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,560
So reckless.

372
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,120
What kind of behavior is that?

373
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,080
Are you alright?

374
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:45,880
I'm fine.

375
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,520
Talking with the Queen Mother,
what could happen?

376
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,320
I'm fine.

377
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,160
Look at you.

378
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,440
Once you're married,

379
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,840
what will you do?

380
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,000
Mother,

381
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,760
I don't want to get married yet.

382
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,560
Then who did I hear say

383
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,880
the princess is fond of

384
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,680
the second son of the Rui family?

385
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,000
Is someone gossiping with intent?

386
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,400
If that's the case,

387
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,520
they must be punished.

388
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,240
Queen Mother, please calm down.

389
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,880
I'm not angry.

390
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,880
The princess is grown now.

391
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,040
She is free to like whomever she wishes.

392
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,120
Mother,

393
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,440
Rui Wang is not at fault.

394
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,560
I was too willful.

395
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,960
I've always been the one pursuing him.

396
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,680
Would I

397
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,040
ever kill him?

398
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,960
You're a clever person.

399
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,280
You know what I mean.

400
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,120
Rui Wang understands.

401
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:57,960
Mother,

402
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,520
what are you going to do?

403
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,160
You are the princess of Ling An.

404
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,080
You should choose the best suitor in Ling An.

405
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,960
Forgive me for being unfilial.

406
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,800
In my heart,

407
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,400
he is the best suitor in Ling An.

408
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,240
You are the princess of Ling An

409
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,600
He is not worthy of you at all

410
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,480
If the Queen Mother thinks so

411
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,080
Then I won't be a princess anymore

412
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,120
I wish to roam the world with Rui Wang

413
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,800
With the sky as our blanket, the earth our bed

414
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,080
Free and carefree

415
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,800
I have now entered officialdom

416
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,200
Princess, you can live in the capital

417
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,960
Why didn't you tell me such an important thing sooner

418
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,680
I just didn't have the chance

419
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,560
Even so, you still should have told me

420
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,400
I was wrong, I was wrong

421
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,120
Enough, enough

422
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,040
Children have their own blessings

423
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,960
As long as you stay in the capital quietly

424
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,200
Don't run around everywhere

425
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,680
Then I can be at ease

426
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,880
Queen Mother, rest assured

427
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:07,920
From now on

428
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,800
I will surely take good care of the princess

429
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,880
Have your father come to the palace tomorrow

430
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,200
It's time

431
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,240
To discuss your marriage with Yan Luo

432
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,760
And have a proper talk

433
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,120
I obey your command

434
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,320
Your Highness

435
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,080
Queen Mother

436
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:32,920
Go on, go on

437
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,280
From now on, it's all up to you

438
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,920
I take my leave

439
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,360
Yan Luo

440
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,960
She is much more promising than her brother

441
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,520
Yan Luo

442
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,800
Princess, what's wrong

443
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:05,720
Did you fall somewhere

444
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,760
Does it hurt

445
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,360
Let me see

446
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,440
I didn't fall

447
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,680
Are you upset

448
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,000
Do you not want to marry me

449
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,320
If you like someone else

450
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,680
I can ask the Queen Mother

451
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,720
How could that be

452
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,720
You're the one I like

453
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,920
I just don't know

454
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,840
If you truly like me

455
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,800
You don't just like me because I'm a princess, do you

456
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,360
Silly girl

457
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,560
Then listen carefully

458
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,760
I don't like you just because you're a princess

459
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,720
Or treat you well for that reason

460
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,240
I like Yan Luo

461
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,880
The one and only Yan Luo in this world

462
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,800
I'm used to a carefree life

463
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,640
Now I've become an official

464
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,800
Just so I could be worthy

465
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,880
To marry you openly and rightfully

466
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,120
My feelings

467
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,800
Do you understand, Princess

468
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,200
Alright

469
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,280
Don't cry

470
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,800
May I be the star, you the moon

471
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,640
Our lights forever intertwined each night

472
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,960
Princess, you truly are clever

473
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,560
You even know how to recite poetry

474
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,960
Are you praising me

475
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,120
Of course

476
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,840
Want something delicious

477
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,960
I do

478
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,840
Squirrel fish and braised lion's head

479
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,520
Alright

480
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,360
I'll get you plenty

481
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:49,680
Let's go

482
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,760
Hurry up

483
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,720
Speaking of

484
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,080
The Nan family

485
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,240
Is a century-old military family

486
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,000
With elders serving two dynasties

487
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,240
General of the North, Nan Hongyi

488
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,640
A loyal patriot

489
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,440
Nan Xingxiao

490
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,200
Now there's another

491
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,760
Great General Zhenning

492
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,600
Nan Chenxiao

493
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,440
Wonderful

494
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,800
Last year, the Pingxiang regent rebelled

495
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,560
They ended the war in just half a month

496
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,480
Now let's talk about the Rui family

497
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,320
Speaking of the Rui family, we must mention

498
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,360
Hanlin Academician Rui Yu

499
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,640
Though Rui Yu is a woman

500
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,360
She earned her title

501
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,680
And gained an official post

502
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,480
She stood firm against opposition

503
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,080
And was sent as envoy to Qian Yuan

504
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,200
Unexpectedly

505
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,400
She was imprisoned by the Qian Yuan prince

506
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,920
She was unyielding

507
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,440
And feared no power

508
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,360
A true model of scholarly integrity

509
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:04,280
Great General Zhenning stormed the Qian Yuan camp

510
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,560
And rescued the Academician

511
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,480
Together, they opened the Border City gates with strategy

512
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,720
And captured the traitor alive

513
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,440
Now, Your Majesty has granted them marriage again

514
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,480
These two

515
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,920
One scholarly, one martial

516
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,680
Gentle and strong, truly

517
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,520
The ideal match under heaven

518
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,840
Congratulations

519
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,600
Please come inside

520
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,360
Please, come in, come in

521
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,360
Please

522
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,840
Please, come in, come in

523
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,080
Master Dong is here too

524
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,360
Master Wang is here too

525
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,720
Congratulations

526
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,720
Thank you, thank you

527
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,880
Master Wang, please take a seat inside

528
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,840
The auspicious hour has arrived

529
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,200
Bride and groom

530
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,560
Bow

531
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,440
First bow to heaven and earth

532
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,200
Honor the heavens

533
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,640
A match made in heaven

534
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,320
Second bow to the parents

535
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,200
Family love as deep as the East Sea

536
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,640
Couple bow to each other

537
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,760
Blessed for three lifetimes

538
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,680
Three stars shine bright

539
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,240
United in heart forever

540
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,040
The ceremony is complete

541
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,600
Good, good

542
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:17,920
Liang Jin

543
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,760
Quick, escort the newlyweds to their room

544
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,120
It's the princess

545
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,320
There are still guests here

546
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,520
Great General

547
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,800
Don't worry

548
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,920
We'll enjoy ourselves

549
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,600
Your Majesty

550
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:48,880
Youyi

551
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,560
That day

552
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,800
If I hadn't met you here

553
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,120
my life

554
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,960
might have lost much of its color

555
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,320
There is no turning back in life

556
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,880
Why dwell on such fleeting thoughts, Your Majesty?

557
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,200
Youyi

558
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:08,680
You

559
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,160
What's wrong?

560
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,320
The weather is perfect today

561
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,960
I'm tired of banquets

562
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:17,880
How about

563
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,760
we go fishing by the river?

564
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,200
Sure

565
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,480
It's a good season now

566
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,680
I'll take you somewhere new

567
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,520
Let's go

568
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,000
Actually

569
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,840
we could use the front gate

570
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:33,640
Alright

571
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,800
Hurry up

572
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,160
Madam

573
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,240
Nan Chenxiao

574
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:20,680
Here

575
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,400
my respects

576
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,400
husband

577
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,640
No wonder

578
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,600
everyone is talking about it now

579
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,760
