1
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,480
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

2
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,960
I was just looking for you.

3
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:51,840
What is it?

4
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,920
Do you have an antidote?

5
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,640
What antidote?

6
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,080
The medicine you gave me today.

7
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,600
You already gave it to me.

8
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,600
Why do you need an antidote now?

9
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm regretting it now.

10
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,280
It's a human life, after all.

11
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,240
Give me the antidote, quickly.

12
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,880
There's no antidote for this.

13
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,600
Besides,

14
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,280
You told me to use a strong dose.

15
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,680
So I used a full dose.

16
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,760
One packet is enough.

17
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,520
That's fatal.

18
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,120
Even if there was an antidote,

19
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,320
it would be too late.

20
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,560
Why?

21
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,040
What should I do?

22
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,760
If nothing works,

23
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,560
try to find a way to help him recover.

24
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:57,960
Enough.

25
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,320
My lord.

26
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,200
Let's go.

27
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,240
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

28
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,920
I was just about to.

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,720
Then don't go.

30
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,800
I've prepared a special meal for you.

31
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,560
Big Brother's agarwood—

32
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,200
It's not that, so eat without worry.

33
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,000
This time it's really to nourish you.

34
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:17,920
Come.

35
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,160
Try this.

36
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,680
You call this

37
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,280
proper nourishment?

38
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,520
Ten Complete Great Tonifying Soup.

39
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,360
This—

40
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,520
Green jade and gold.

41
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,440
And this one—

42
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,320
Xitang braised eel.

43
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,080
How is this not proper?

44
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,200
Don't be shy.

45
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,160
Eat as much as you want.

46
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,640
If it's not enough, I'll make more.

47
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,400
You—

48
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,160
Are you feeling alright?

49
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,200
I just woke up this morning

50
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,280
with a bit of a headache.

51
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,320
And then—

52
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,160
Here, finish this bowl.

53
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,640
I'm going to be late for court.

54
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,680
Grab a lunchbox from the kitchen and eat on the way.

55
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,960
Thank you, My Lady.

56
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,120
Liang Jin.

57
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:15,520
Yes.

58
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,520
I'll go right away.

59
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,920
Such a good soup—

60
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,360
It would be a waste.

61
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,080
I'll eat it.

62
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,320
Miss Nan truly is a heroine among women.

63
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,880
She's really bold.

64
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,520
But why is she suddenly trying to nourish My Lord?

65
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,920
She was so indifferent just the other day.

66
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,560
Isn't it said

67
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,240
that a woman's temper

68
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,960
is like spring weather—

69
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,360
always changing?

70
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,880
That's probably it.

71
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,000
My lord.

72
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,680
Have some food.

73
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,440
No, no.

74
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,560
I have no appetite.

75
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:56,840
Tonight,

76
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,080
clear out the people from Yuqing Pavilion.

77
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,160
Yes, My Lord.

78
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,880
Rui Manor even has hot springs.

79
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,640
Such a fine stream flows through here.

80
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,440
Who knows how much was embezzled.

81
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,760
Yuqing Pavilion—

82
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,320
seems truly deserted.

83
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,440
It's quite comfortable.

84
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:26,720
You—

85
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,840
Why are you here?

86
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,160
Why is My Lady here?

87
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,360
You're not in the study?

88
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,760
I've been a bit tired lately.

89
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,640
So,

90
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,680
I thought I'd come to relax.

91
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,000
Then I'll step out first.

92
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,600
You go ahead.

93
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,080
I'm really sorry.

94
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,480
Alright.

95
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,600
Do not look at what is improper.

96
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,480
I understand.

97
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,440
I understand.

98
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,120
This—

99
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,680
Had too much tonic this morning.

100
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,880
It really invigorates the blood.

101
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,360
She didn't see anything, did she?

102
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,680
Did you notice anything unusual?

103
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,600
You've been watching for so long.

104
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,960
We're heading out soon.

105
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,480
Isn't Rui Yu a treacherous minister?

106
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,160
How has he tolerated me for so long?

107
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,560
Your Majesty granted this marriage.

108
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,360
Would he dare to divorce you so easily?

109
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,160
He'd at least wait a year or two.

110
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,840
If you have no child in two years,

111
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,120
you can request a mutual divorce.

112
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,080
Two years—

113
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,520
That's hard to endure.

114
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,120
Don't think about it, don't think.

115
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:42,920
Still have to separate.

116
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,840
I watched Rui Yu grow up.

117
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,160
Your Majesty granted him this marriage.

118
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,840
I'm extremely dissatisfied.

119
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,520
But there's nothing I can do.

120
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,240
You've noticed it too.

121
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,000
Your Majesty wants to promote the military officers.

122
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:56,960
A few days ago,

123
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,000
he even told me

124
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:58,680
to

125
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,600
increase troops and expand the military.

126
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,440
This—

127
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,520
isn't it a waste of resources?

128
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,200
Rui Yu is here.

129
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,960
Student.

130
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,240
Greetings, Master.

131
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,840
You came at just the right time.

132
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,520
I was just talking with your father.

133
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,520
We were discussing your marriage.

134
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,120
Is there anything wrong with that?

135
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,320
Your Majesty wants you to marry.

136
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,960
Have you thought about why that is?

137
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,480
I believe

138
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,160
Your Majesty's decision

139
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,960
is to promote civil-military harmony.

140
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,120
Restore the military officials.

141
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,160
Among the three kingdoms,

142
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,400
there's only been peace for a dozen years.

143
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,200
If we restore the military hastily,

144
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,080
what will the other two kingdoms think?

145
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,480
If war breaks out again,

146
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,760
then

147
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,800
wouldn't the Rui family be blamed for it?

148
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,360
If the military gains a place in court,

149
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,920
and can restrain Qian Yuan and Pingxiang

150
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,960
without bloodshed,

151
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,800
it would be a merit for our Rui family.

152
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,560
That would be a great achievement.

153
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,280
Now you are tasked with overseeing the Spring Imperial Examination.

154
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,480
Perhaps Your Majesty

155
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,880
intends to use a civil-military marriage alliance

156
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,560
to promote the Military Imperial Examination.

157
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,640
Using a civil-military marriage alliance

158
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
to advance the Military Imperial Examination.

159
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,200
If that's truly the case,

160
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,760
then if Rui Yu and I divorce,

161
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,720
wouldn't that ruin everything?

162
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,560
Now that Rui Yu is married,

163
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,240
let's give Your Majesty some time.

164
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:38,680
If

165
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,320
as Rui Yu said, peace can be kept without bloodshed,

166
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,800
then it's fine.

167
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,480
But

168
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,360
if anything changes,

169
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,680
if Miss Nan is not the right person,

170
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,160
I

171
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,360
will join the six ministers

172
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,280
to help Rui Yu seek a mutual divorce.

173
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:00,800
Then

174
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,680
I must trouble you, Grand Councilor.

175
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,240
What should I do?

176
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,400
Pretend to be loving with Rui Yu

177
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,280
to maintain the civil-military alliance?

178
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,720
But my identity...

179
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,240
My Lady,

180
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,280
sorry to keep you waiting.

181
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,440
Let's go.

182
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,480
Alright.

183
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,320
This must be Miss Nan.

184
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,080
Darn it.

185
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,120
Greetings, Grand Councilor.

186
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,120
I didn't know you were coming.

187
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,160
I failed to welcome you.

188
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,680
That was truly discourteous.

189
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,520
Please don't take offense.

190
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,920
It's fine.

191
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:51,960
Master.

192
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:52,640
Father.

193
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,800
It's getting late.

194
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,040
My Lady and I need to deliver a return gift.

195
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,240
We'll take our leave.

196
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:58,560
Go ahead.

197
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,920
I'll continue talking with your father.

198
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,040
We'll chat a bit more.

199
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,040
My Lord,

200
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,160
are you alright?

201
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,520
I'm fine.

202
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,360
Be careful.

203
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,000
This marriage—

204
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:25,960
I'm not divorcing.

205
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,240
And

206
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,400
I want to be

207
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,320
a good wife.

208
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,600
Da Bai,

209
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,720
you must be starving.

210
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,760
I'll get you something tasty soon.

211
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,600
You scared me to death.

212
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,600
What are you doing?

213
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,280
Where did you come from?

214
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:44,920
Big Brother,

215
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:45,960
are you hungry?

216
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,200
Have some snacks.

217
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,200
I'll cook later.

218
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,120
You're cooking again?

219
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,200
I heard at Yun Shui Jian

220
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,600
there's some new peach blossom wine.

221
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,600
I'll have someone

222
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,880
Why is it you?

223
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,800
Come over here.

224
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,280
What is it, Madam?

225
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,120
Take this horse

226
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,160
to the stable.

227
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,120
Yes, Madam.

228
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:24,960
Wait.

229
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,600
Elder sister-in-law, let me.

230
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,920
Let me do it.

231
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,560
Big Brother.

232
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,680
I'll help you dig.

233
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,320
Are you a ghost?

234
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,320
Big Brother.

235
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,080
Done.

236
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,520
You can bury it now.

237
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,840
That nearly killed me.

238
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,480
Yu'er,

239
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,640
you're finally back.

240
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,240
What's going on?

241
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,280
Quick, take her away.

242
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,600
My Lord,

243
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,360
are you taking me out?

244
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You don't want to take me?

245
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,760
On this trip,

246
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,760
I have other important matters.

247
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,120
Publicly,

248
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,160
traveling with My Lady is just a cover.

249
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,840
I hope My Lady understands.

250
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,440
This journey is full of danger.

251
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,560
I don't want you to be at risk.

252
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,760
Even less

253
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,520
do I want you dragged into court intrigue.

254
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:51,920
Danger?

255
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,800
As a general's daughter,

256
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,080
I've never feared such things.

257
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,560
I face blades and swords head-on.

258
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,000
That's not what I meant.

259
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,320
Do you also look down on us

260
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,960
military folk like the civil officials do?

261
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,960
In peaceful times,

262
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,800
soldiers are kept for years, never used.

263
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,320
Military men are seen as

264
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,240
mere fools playing with weapons.

265
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,200
I never meant that.

266
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,160
Though the world is peaceful now,

267
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,760
if not for soldiers guarding the borders,

268
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,800
never slacking off,

269
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,840
how could the people live in peace?

270
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,400
I hope there will be no more wars.

271
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,920
And that good generals remain.

272
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,320
In short,

273
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,880
if we act, we must play the part fully.

274
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,120
I must go.

275
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,120
I...

276
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,560
Alright.

277
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,680
I'll have Liang Jin

278
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,160
help you pack your things.

279
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,560
Court politics are full of intrigue.

280
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,160
Who can truly stay out of it?

281
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,000
What did My Lady say?

282
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,320
I said,

283
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,600
I'm bringing Fu Lü with me.

284
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,360
Alright.

285
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:03,640
My Lord.

286
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,000
For this trip,

287
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,640
Why is Fu Lü coming too?

288
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,600
Fu Lü,

289
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,480
catch a butterfly for me.

290
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,400
That's impressive!

291
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,200
I taught her Ti Yun Zong.

292
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,280
How is it?

293
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,600
Fu Lü has other uses too.

294
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,040
You'll see on the road.

295
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,120
Let's go, Fu Lü.

296
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:55,960
Announce.

297
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,440
Prince Pan requests an audience.

298
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,320
Pan Zi Zhai of Qian Yuan.

299
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,320
Greetings, Your Majesty of Ling An.

300
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:05,960
No need for formalities.

301
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,280
Thank you, Your Majesty.

302
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,120
Grand Councilor is here too.

303
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:10,760
Prince.

304
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,240
Prince Pan wishes to discuss matters with Your Majesty.

305
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,000
Then,

306
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,840
I shall take my leave.

307
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,680
Li Quan.

308
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,160
Yes.

309
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,400
Escort the Grand Councilor out.

310
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,120
Yes.

311
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,360
You entered the palace today—

312
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,880
Is there something you wish to discuss?

313
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,920
Nothing major.

314
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,320
Qian Yuan sent some leather goods and gems.

315
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,720
I wish to present them to Your Majesty.

316
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,160
Prince Pan is thoughtful.

317
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,920
You've been in Ling An

318
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,680
for quite a few years now.

319
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,280
This year

320
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,640
marks the nineteenth year.

321
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,600
So that means,

322
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,720
you should've returned nine years ago.

323
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,160
Yes.

324
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,360
But Qian Yuan hasn't had a new royal heir.

325
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,040
Naturally,

326
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,880
there's no new royal blood to exchange with me.

327
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,920
Living in a foreign land,

328
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,760
one needs something to hold onto.

329
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,960
You've been in Jingdu Cheng for years.

330
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,840
You must have made many friends here.

331
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,360
I usually just

332
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,800
go wherever there's a banquet.

333
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,000
Join the fun.

334
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,200
Always leave drunk.

335
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,640
I don't really have close friends.

336
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:18,800
Except

337
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,920
I sometimes visit the Rui family

338
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,160
to see my aunt.

339
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,600
I almost forgot—

340
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,880
your mother was from Ling An.

341
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,160
In a way,

342
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,440
it's like returning to your roots.

343
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,280
Just as Your Majesty said,

344
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,880
when I first arrived in Ling An,

345
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,320
I felt a sense of belonging.

346
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:38,840
I

347
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,960
stay deep within the palace,

348
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,360
rarely have a chance to leave.

349
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,800
Outside the palace,

350
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,760
have you heard any interesting stories?

351
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,440
I've heard

352
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,080
Pingxiang has a unique dyeing technique.

353
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,640
It can dye one cloth in four colors.

354
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,160
When made into a skirt, under sunlight

355
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,160
it's quite magical.

356
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,280
It looks like a fairy's attire.

357
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,240
This tiny country,

358
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,040
is truly charming.

359
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,080
It seems Prince Pan

360
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,360
is quite interested in Pingxiang.

361
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,000
If a place is interesting,

362
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,680
I'm always willing to learn about it.

363
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,040
Your Majesty,

364
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,040
these are pastries made by the imperial chef.

365
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,280
Take them and have a taste.

366
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,440
Thank you, Your Majesty.

367
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,720
I'm feeling a bit tired.

368
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,720
I won't keep you for a meal.

369
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,120
You jest, Your Majesty.

370
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,280
Li Quan.

371
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:26,840
Yes.

372
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,080
Escort Prince Pan out.

373
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:28,640
Yes.

374
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,760
This way, Prince Pan.

375
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,320
Your Majesty.

376
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,400
He's left.

377
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,200
Gone.

378
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,920
Prince Pan is polite.

379
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,200
He wouldn't let me escort him.

380
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,280
Servant.

381
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,840
He let Li Zhong do it.

382
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,840
He's quite thorough.

383
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:04,760
Your Majesty,

384
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,840
send more men to watch the Hostage Residence.

385
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,920
Keep a close eye on Pan Zi Zhai's every move.

386
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,000
I'll arrange it right away.

387
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,960
It's clearly daytime,

388
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,360
but no vendors are in the streets.

389
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,000
Strange.

390
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,440
My Lady.

391
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:37,880
Slow down.

392
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,760
Riding in the carriage is exhausting.

393
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,480
Let's go inside and rest.

394
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,400
Go in and take a look.

395
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,280
Yes.

396
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,080
Who is it?

397
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,280
We're from Jingdu Cheng.

398
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,520
Jingdu Cheng?

399
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,080
Yes, yes.

400
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,200
It's Lord Rui!

401
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,560
I was just cleaning up.

402
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,000
Sorry for not greeting you sooner.

403
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,640
Please forgive me, Lord Rui.

404
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,800
Lead the way.

405
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,080
Please, come inside.

406
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,360
Please.

407
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,840
Except for our group,

408
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,680
is anyone else staying here?

409
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,160
No one else.

410
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:31,880
This humble official

411
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,560
cleared out the post station especially

412
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,000
to welcome Your Lordship and My Lady.

413
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,800
You are quite thoughtful.

414
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,840
To serve Your Lordship

415
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,600
is a blessing beyond measure.

416
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,320
The best room upstairs

417
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,080
has been prepared for you both.

418
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,520
On the left is Tianshu Pavilion,

419
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,400
and on the right is Tianxuan Pavilion.

420
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,960
We as husband and wife

421
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,280
can share one room.

422
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:00,800
Mainly,

423
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,680
the beds here are not large.

424
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,280
I'm worried you may not be used to it.

425
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:04,840
So,

426
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,200
that's why I arranged it this way.

427
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,520
What does My Lady think?

428
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:12,920
You prefer quiet.

429
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,440
You should take the west room.

430
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:15,880
Alright.

431
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,760
Then go upstairs and rest.

432
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,080
Lord Rui,

433
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:29,560
Well,

434
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,400
this humble official

435
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,480
will take my leave as well.

436
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,560
Young Prince,

437
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:02,920
please.

438
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,320
Did you need something from me?

439
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,480
I want to go out for a walk.

440
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,800
Would you like to come with me?

441
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,480
I'll stay here.

442
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,200
It's safer to remain at the post station.

443
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:24,920
Alright.

444
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,440
If I see something interesting,

445
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,040
I'll bring it back for you.

446
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,120
Then take care of yourself.

447
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,280
By the way,

448
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,680
this is

449
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,080
the short sword my Big Brother left me.

450
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,680
Keep it for your protection.

451
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,120
No wonder on your wedding day

452
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,680
you insisted on carrying it.

453
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,880
Such an important item

454
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,120
isn't right for me to have.

455
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,360
Why not?

456
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,440
You are my husband.

457
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,840
Your safety matters most.

458
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,200
Take it.

459
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,200
Well,

460
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,400
thank you.

461
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:57,960
I'm off.

462
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:17,960
A toast to you.

463
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,520
Honored guest,

464
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,160
you've arrived.

465
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,400
Please come inside.

466
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:25,680
Honored guest,

467
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,400
please have a seat.

468
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,200
Honored guest,

469
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,360
what would you like to order?

470
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:36,800
Two taels of beef

471
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,680
and a pot of rice wine.

472
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:38,800
Alright.

473
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,720
It'll be ready soon.

474
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,840
My batch of goods

475
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,960
can't be sold in Pingxiang now.

476
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,840
We sell our own goods.

477
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,560
What does it matter to the King of Pingxiang?

478
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,320
You know as well as I do,

479
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,080
the King's brother, Hou Qi,

480
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,200
is cruel and ruthless.

481
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,520
He has always hated our country.

482
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,120
Now he governs in the King's stead.

483
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,320
We should avoid him if we can.

484
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,920
Where could you possibly hide?

485
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,360
Still, we have to try.

486
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,320
Tell me,

487
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,400
the King of Pingxiang has a son.

488
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:05,960
No matter what,

489
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,040
Hou Qi shouldn't inherit the throne.

490
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,400
Brother,

491
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,040
you don't know yet.

492
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,200
The King's heir was badly injured while hunting.

493
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,280
His fate is still uncertain.

494
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,560
I'm telling you,

495
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,680
anyway,

496
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:20,760
tomorrow

497
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,560
I'm heading to Qian Yuan instead.

498
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,840
If things go wrong with Pingxiang,

499
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,120
it'll be hard to find a place in Qian Yuan.

500
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,520
So that's Rui Yu's plan.

501
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:32,840
Fire!

502
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,640
The post station is on fire!

503
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,200
The post station!

504
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,080
Rui Yu!

505
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,760
Fire! Fire!

506
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,520
Rui Yu!

507
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:45,680
Your Lordship!

508
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,040
Young Prince, hide quickly!

509
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:52,800
Rui Yu!

510
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,160
My Lady!

511
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:16,720
Let's go!

512
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,080
Young Prince, hurry!

513
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,560
We can't escape like this.

514
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,160
Fu Lü!

515
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,320
Take the Young Prince that way.

516
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,360
We'll distract the pursuers.

517
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,040
Alright.

518
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:31,560
Go!

519
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:33,480
Go!

520
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,200
Chase them!

521
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,600
Over there!

522
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,400
Hurry!

523
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,520
Chase!

524
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,480
Go!

525
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:52,600
Over there!

526
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:53,960
Stop running!

527
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:54,920
Freeze!

528
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:55,680
You can't escape now.

529
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,480
What should we do?

530
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,880
There's no way out.

531
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,200
Careful!

532
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,360
Chen Xiao!

533
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,320
You hide first.

534
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,480
Once they catch me, they won't act rashly.

535
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,400
There may still be hope.

536
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:12,720
Jump off the cliff!

537
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,040
Go, quickly!

538
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:30,640
What now?

539
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,320
I'll go back and report.

540
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,080
The rest search below.

541
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:32,520
Search below!

542
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,080
Yes!

543
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:35,920
Hold on a bit longer.

544
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,360
It's alright.

545
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,200
There's a cave ahead.

546
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,280
Go!

547
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:45,800
Go!

548
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:48,720
Careful!

549
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,160
Careful!

550
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,200
My Lady

551
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,120
Be careful.

552
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,320
The arrow is poisoned.

553
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,480
You just exerted force.

554
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,880
I'm afraid the poison
has entered your heart meridian.

555
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,200
It's poisoned.

556
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,400
Rui Yu,

557
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,520
I have a secret to tell you.

558
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,160
Let me treat your wound first.

559
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,240
We can talk slowly.

560
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,880
Listen to me first.

561
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:32,840
Alright.

562
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,320
Go ahead.

563
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,760
I once saved your life.

564
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,120
You won't forget your debt, will you?

565
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,720
I surely won't.

566
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,800
Alright.

567
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,240
This secret

568
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,760
I will only tell you.

569
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,760
Actually, I...

570
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,400
am a man.
