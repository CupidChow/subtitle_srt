1
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,520
So bland and tasteless.

2
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,120
Attendants!

3
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,600
Bring me the wine from Wu Rong.

4
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,600
Royal Brother,

5
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,800
it's been five days now.

6
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,560
Still no word of Young Master Beicheng.

7
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,680
I've had people searching in secret.

8
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,600
But this is someone else's capital.

9
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,200
From the looks of it,

10
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,200
they're not truly helping us search.

11
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,320
Could it be they're

12
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,200
hoping we'll leave if we can't find him?

13
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,640
Are they stalling us on purpose?

14
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,560
Royal Brother, where are you going?

15
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,080
To see the Monarch of Ling'an.

16
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,040
I want answers.

17
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,080
Summon King Wurong for an audience.

18
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,360
Step aside.

19
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,440
Monarch of Ling'an,

20
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,320
it's been five days now.

21
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,440
There's not a single clue.

22
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,640
Are you disregarding me

23
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,960
and Wu Rong?

24
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,880
Do you not take us seriously?

25
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,120
I think

26
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,760
this alliance

27
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,400
isn't worth making.

28
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,880
King Wurong, please don't rush.

29
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,320
Searching with just a name and age

30
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,200
is like finding a needle in the sea.

31
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,680
These past days,

32
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,400
the Monarch and I have sent people searching.

33
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,520
Our Monarch of Ling'an keeps his word.

34
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,880
He spares no effort for his promises.

35
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,080
But I wonder,

36
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,600
why do you bring a blade to court?

37
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,960
What does it mean?

38
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,600
I don't care for your customs.

39
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,400
If in three days

40
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,320
we still can't find him,

41
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,560
Wu Rong's soldiers

42
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,880
will march into Ling'an's border.

43
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,800
King Wurong,

44
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,640
are you trying to break our alliance?

45
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,440
Will you risk Wu Rong's people's safety?

46
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,080
We Wu Rong are born on horseback.

47
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,080
Battle runs deep in our bones.

48
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,240
I'm sure my people

49
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,200
will support my Royal Brother's choice.

50
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,000
I

51
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,720
have said all I will.

52
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,120
Now it's up to Ling'an's Monarch's sincerity.

53
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,360
Let's go.

54
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,640
Rui Yu, stay.

55
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,720
Everyone else,

56
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,520
leave for now.

57
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,760
I take my leave.

58
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,560
Is Young Master Beicheng one of ours?

59
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,800
Is he?

60
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,880
He's not from Ling'an.

61
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,400
When will we ever find him?

62
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,120
I didn't expect Wu Rong

63
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,600
to value Young Master Beicheng

64
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,720
so highly.

65
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,280
They're willing, for him,

66
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,040
to go to war with Ling'an.

67
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,360
The capital

68
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,640
truly has no news.

69
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,440
I've sent people to search the border.

70
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,480
If he exists,

71
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,080
we'll have news in three days.

72
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,000
But if this person

73
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,920
is hiding his identity,

74
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,840
I'm afraid

75
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,680
with Ling'an's forces,

76
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
going to war with Wu Rong

77
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,320
wouldn't be difficult.

78
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,800
But Pingxiang has just stabilized.

79
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,240
Qian Yuan's hostage returns soon.

80
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,280
If war breaks out now,

81
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,600
it may upset the long-standing balance.

82
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,600
Yes.

83
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,640
Rui Yu,

84
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,320
find a way first

85
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,440
to calm King Wurong and the princess.

86
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,080
As for the alliance,

87
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,680
wait for news from the border.

88
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,920
Then we'll decide what to do.

89
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,800
Understood.

90
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,200
Why do you look so tired?

91
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,440
King Wurong and Princess Muya entered the palace.

92
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,280
They said if in three days

93
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,200
we still can't find Young Master Beicheng,

94
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,640
they'll go to war with Ling'an.

95
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,280
I just asked my second brother for news.

96
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,160
None of the nearby cities have a match.

97
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,200
Next, we can only wait for border news.

98
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,680
What's wrong?

99
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,480
It's nothing.

100
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,240
I was thinking, King Wurong

101
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,400
would use his whole nation

102
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,520
just to find one person.

103
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,920
It's probably because King Wurong

104
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,360
has deep feelings for Young Master Beicheng.

105
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,360
These days,

106
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,200
he's been secretly searching everywhere.

107
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,600
He thought he was discreet,

108
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,840
but unexpectedly,

109
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,920
my brother's men still found out.

110
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,240
Luckily, it didn't endanger Ling'an's people.

111
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,240
Otherwise, how would this end?

112
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,280
I've finally found you.

113
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,600
Did you know I was searching for you?

114
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,600
Since the day you entered the city,

115
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,520
I knew.

116
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,320
Then why did you wait until now to see me?

117
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,680
The Da Yue people are so shameless.

118
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,280
You were hunted by them, your fate unknown.

119
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,840
I've been worried about you all along.

120
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,520
Don't you understand my feelings yet?

121
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,360
Young Master Beicheng,

122
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:21,880
look—

123
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,760
this horse is my Royal Brother's favorite.

124
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,160
But it's wild-tempered.

125
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,360
No one has tamed it yet.

126
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,840
If you can tame this fierce horse,

127
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,040
then I will give it to you.

128
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,240
Hyah!

129
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:15,960
Hyah!

130
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:16,880
Hyah!

131
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:17,920
Hyah!

132
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:29,800
Beicheng!

133
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,000
You did it!

134
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,520
You are the bravest warrior.

135
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,120
As long as you keep up with its speed,

136
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,000
you can be its companion.

137
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,760
Only a warrior like Young Master Beicheng

138
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,080
is worthy of our Wu Rong princess.

139
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,080
Princess

140
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,440
I told you early on

141
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,320
that I am already married.

142
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,240
My royal brother said

143
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,640
that this is nothing serious.

144
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,200
Warriors of our grasslands

145
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,680
can have several wives.

146
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,920
I would treat your wife kindly too.

147
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,840
We could bring her back to the grasslands.

148
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,000
I could even let her bear the eldest son.

149
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:15,640
Princess

150
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:16,560
But

151
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,360
I am not willing.

152
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,720
She is my only wife in this life.

153
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,120
My love will never change.

154
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:25,800
You...

155
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,560
What do you mean by that?

156
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,360
Are you saying you feel nothing for me?

157
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,960
I only respect you as Princess Muya of Wu Rong.

158
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,320
But you protect me,

159
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,000
care for me—

160
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,600
isn't that love?

161
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,640
Your royal brother and I call each other brothers.

162
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,520
I only see you as a younger sister.

163
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,520
That's all.

164
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,280
Do you know,

165
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,920
my name,

166
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,080
Muya of Wu Rong,

167
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,800
means "moon" in the Wu Rong language.

168
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,440
The grasslands are vast and endless.

169
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,960
When you lose your way,

170
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,480
only the moon follows the lonely warrior.

171
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,960
It lights his way home.

172
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,680
Only the purest moon

173
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,800
is worthy of the bravest warrior.

174
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,040
If I stay in Ling An,

175
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,440
can I be your moon?

176
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,360
Princess,

177
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,360
I understand your feelings.

178
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,440
But I already have

179
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,240
a moon that belongs only to me.

180
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,600
She has always guided me,

181
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,120
so wherever I am,

182
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,480
I can find my way home.

183
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,000
May I meet your moon?

184
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,800
Please persuade King Wurong

185
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,640
that war between our nations

186
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,160
only harms the people.

187
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,680
Wu Rong now has water.

188
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,880
The people of Wu Rong

189
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,840
deserve a stable home.

190
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,440
I won't trouble you further.

191
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,280
But how can I deliver these words for you?

192
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,440
You should tell my royal brother yourself.

193
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,760
Princess,

194
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,960
I have said all I can.

195
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,920
Bring out Rui Yu.

196
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,200
What are you trying to do?

197
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,200
Stop them!

198
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,040
If you don't come out—

199
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:24,840
Stop!

200
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:26,960
Master Rui,

201
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,360
King Wurong forced his way into my manor.

202
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,120
What is your purpose here?

203
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,920
Was the embassy's hospitality lacking?

204
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,560
If the Monarch of Ling'an

205
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,360
learns your Rui family harbors selfish motives,

206
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,960
and hid Young Master Beicheng's whereabouts,

207
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,480
causing war between our nations,

208
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,000
then you, Rui Yu,

209
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,760
will be the culprit.

210
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,920
Young Master Beicheng—

211
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,440
why would he be in my manor?

212
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,600
I met him on the street yesterday.

213
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,520
I saw him enter your manor.

214
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,720
Do you still want to deny it?

215
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,640
Search the place!

216
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,280
If war truly breaks out,

217
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,240
my death is no matter.

218
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,520
But you two are in a foreign land—

219
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,040
can you expect a good end?

220
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,400
Wu Rong people

221
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,440
fight for their pride.

222
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,320
I may not return to Wu Rong alive,

223
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,760
but Young Master Beicheng has helped Wu Rong.

224
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,320
Even if I die,

225
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,000
I must find him.

226
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,120
If what Princess Muya said is true,

227
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,320
you met Young Master Beicheng yesterday,

228
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,640
and he is willing

229
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,240
to return to Wu Rong with you,

230
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,200
then why didn't he go back to Sifang Guest House?

231
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,600
Why did he hide in my manor

232
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,720
and cause all this trouble?

233
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,520
You...

234
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,880
King Wurong is loyal and honorable.

235
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,800
He'd use all his power for Young Master Beicheng.

236
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:57,640
I, Rui,

237
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,960
greatly admire that.

238
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,240
But this concerns both nations.

239
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,760
If because of this

240
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,720
both sides suffer losses,

241
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,400
others

242
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,960
will reap the benefits.

243
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,720
The day after tomorrow

244
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,760
is the final deadline.

245
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,320
Master Rui,

246
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,560
consider this carefully.

247
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,120
I will wait at Sifang Guest House.

248
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,840
If I don't see him,

249
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,800
this matter

250
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,280
won't be over.

251
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,480
Let's go.

252
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,400
Rui Yu,

253
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,840
are you hurt?

254
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,840
I'm fine.

255
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,400
Little Yu,

256
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,400
to use one person

257
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,960
to trade for an alliance between two nations—

258
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,280
it's truly a tempting offer.

259
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,800
King Wurong's loyalty is unmatched.

260
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,160
Princess Muya's feelings run deep.

261
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,760
I am not their equal.

262
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,640
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

263
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,240
I just didn't want you to worry.

264
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,880
After all, I have returned.

265
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,640
That day, my second brother and I

266
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,120
rescued children who had been abducted.

267
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,080
I chased a suspicious Wu Rong man.

268
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,440
They knocked me out.

269
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,760
They falsely accused me

270
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,400
of kidnapping the young prince.

271
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,200
While I was exhausted,

272
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,720
they put shackles on me.

273
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,440
I became a slave.

274
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,760
Later, the Da Yue people

275
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,240
colluded to invade the Wu Rong court.

276
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,080
I saved King Wurong

277
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,480
and Princess Muya.

278
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,000
So I was treated as an honored guest.

279
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,520
They refused to let me return to Ling An.

280
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,040
I didn't want the herders to suffer Da Yue's oppression.

281
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,240
That's why I agreed to stay.

282
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,960
To help King Wurong fight Da Yue.

283
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,120
But I never agreed to marry Princess Muya.

284
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,920
That's all nonsense.

285
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,080
My heart is only for you.

286
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,520
It's a pity.

287
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,640
Ling An's Sifang City

288
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,240
can't compare to the freedom of the plains.

289
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,680
Young Master Beicheng can't

290
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,160
ride freely here.

291
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,720
What are you even talking about?

292
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,280
Princess Muya said

293
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,360
Ling An isn't a good place.

294
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,240
Why not?

295
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,320
It's great.

296
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,320
What's so great about it?

297
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,840
Ling An has my family.

298
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,960
It holds my childhood memories.

299
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,880
More importantly,

300
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,160
Ling An has you.

301
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,600
I'll let you off this time.

302
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,000
If it happens again,

303
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,560
I swear, strike me dead with lightning.

304
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:29,960
That's more like it.

305
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,920
Where are you going?

306
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,960
I'm going to see Princess Muya.

307
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,400
Then I...

308
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,320
You're not allowed to follow.

309
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,000
But what if she tries something with you?

310
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,720
Here in Ling An,

311
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,560
no one dares act up in front of me.

312
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,160
That's good.

313
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,800
Even if there's some left,

314
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,600
that's fine, right?

315
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,520
Yes.

316
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,080
Princess.

317
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,080
Please.

318
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,480
Waiter.

319
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,080
Two more pots of tea, please.

320
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,000
Coming right up.

321
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,720
I really don't get why Beicheng insists on returning to Ling An.

322
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,680
This city of Ling An

323
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,320
is so small you can see its edge at a glance.

324
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,400
Stuck here, you can't go anywhere.

325
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,400
Back in Wu Rong,

326
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,080
he was so free.

327
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,640
He moved as gracefully as an eagle.

328
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,000
Only Royal Brother and I could keep up with him.

329
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,560
When we rode together,

330
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,960
those were the happiest times.

331
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,560
Where is the princess going?

332
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,320
Hurry!

333
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,200
Come quickly!

334
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,520
Let go!

335
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,680
Are all Ling An people this uptight?

336
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,840
Princess, just say what's on your mind.

337
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,360
Look.

338
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,840
That horse is my Baoyang.

339
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,160
Let me take you deep into the plains, okay?

340
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:18,720
No, I won't go.

341
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,520
Are you sure you won't go?

342
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,320
You can see Ling An from that direction.

343
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,000
I know you miss home.

344
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,920
Someday,

345
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,320
I want to see where you once lived.

346
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,480
Though I can't right now,

347
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,040
doesn't Ling An have a saying

348
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,320
called "Entrusting Longings Afar"?

349
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,080
Let's go.

350
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,280
Hyah!

351
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:49,520
Hyah!

352
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,400
Hyah!

353
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,400
Hyah!

354
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:53,800
Hyah!

355
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:57,880
Hyah!

356
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:58,840
Hyah!

357
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:05,960
Hyah!

358
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:07,840
Hyah!

359
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:08,880
Hyah!

360
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,560
That "Entrusting Longings Afar" I mentioned today—

361
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,880
Did I get its meaning right?

362
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,360
Sending longing from afar.

363
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,920
What's the full phrase?

364
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,240
Letters hard to send,

365
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,800
longings without proof.

366
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,200
I only wish the west wind would carry my feelings,

367
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,280
into your heart far away.

368
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,200
What does it mean?

369
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,880
Just a sentimental line.

370
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,160
Not fit for a princess.

371
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,640
So what does that poem really mean?

372
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,600
Can you not be so slow?

373
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,560
Hurry and tell me!

374
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,600
Even with the most beautiful words,

375
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,200
to record one's longing,

376
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,360
it's hard to find a place to send them.

377
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,840
Even if the longing is deep,

378
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,440
it's hard to find someone to express it to.

379
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,560
I only wish the west wind knows my feelings,

380
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,920
carries my love,

381
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,720
and blows it to the one I miss.

382
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,000
Such deep feelings.

383
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,480
He must really miss his wife.

384
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,520
You know he has a wife,

385
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,040
yet you still want to marry him?

386
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,240
Our Wu Rong warriors

387
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,880
some have many wives.

388
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,280
In Ling An,

389
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,920
aren't there concubines and secondary wives too?

390
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,000
As long as two people truly love each other,

391
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,200
none of that matters.

392
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,640
But...

393
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,440
Doesn't "jun" usually mean a man?

394
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,800
Maybe he was thinking of

395
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,560
his father or elder brother.

396
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,360
Maybe in his heart,

397
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,160
his wife

398
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,840
is a woman equal to any man.

399
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,400
It's been days since we met.

400
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,640
Your Majesty has grown lazy.

401
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,480
Is Your Majesty well?

402
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,880
I'm fine.

403
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,560
Brother Beicheng,

404
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,360
you finally showed up.

405
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,880
Come, sit.

406
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,160
Put everything else aside for now.

407
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,720
Have a few drinks with me first.

408
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,280
Three cups have been finished.

409
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,840
Time to get down to business.

410
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,680
I have just one thing to say.

411
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,640
Come back to Wu Rong with me.

412
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,080
I'll form an alliance with Ling An.

413
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,280
And if I refuse?

414
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,440
Will you raise troops to attack the border?

415
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,760
There's no rush right now.

416
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,080
Perhaps

417
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,640
I could also befriend Qian Yuan.

418
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,080
You've met Prince Pan.

419
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,760
You truly are Brother Beicheng.

420
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,760
I haven't met him in person,

421
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,320
but I did receive his gift.

422
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,560
So,

423
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:12,880
you

424
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,800
how will you choose?

425
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,600
Wu Rong is leaderless now.

426
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,280
If I lead a surprise attack,

427
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,120
how likely do you think I'd win?

428
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,640
I don't mean to boast,

429
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,280
but you and I both know

430
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,920
I know your side very well.

431
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,840
But you

432
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,120
know nothing about me.

433
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,480
You've achieved nothing in Ling An.

434
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,320
No one here even knows your name.

435
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,160
What's the point of staying here?

436
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,480
My family,

437
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,360
my beloved,

438
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,080
and my elders

439
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,440
are all in Ling An.

440
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,440
And I have a lifelong mission to fulfill.

441
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,400
Whether I endure humiliation,

442
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,000
fight the enemy alone,

443
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,520
or die on the battlefield,

444
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,320
I have no regrets.

445
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,400
What you said—

446
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,280
I can relate to some of it.

447
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,560
Very well.

448
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,640
I came to find you

449
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,280
just to see if you were still alive.

450
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,440
That day, you were chased by Da Yue.

451
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,320
Your fate was unknown.

452
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,360
I've long seen you as a brother in life and death.

453
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:31,720
Naturally,

454
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,280
I was worried and heartbroken.

455
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,640
Of course, I respect Your Highness

456
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,920
as I would an elder brother.

457
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,360
Then

458
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,960
if the Monarch of Ling'an

459
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,840
orders you to attack Wu Rong,

460
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,520
what will you do?

461
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,920
As long as Wu Rong doesn't cross our border,

462
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,280
I will never raise arms against Wu Rong.

463
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,640
If the monarch insists on war,

464
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
the one leading the troops

465
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,760
will not be me.

466
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,360
Alright.

467
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,080
Then I accept you as my brother.

468
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,760
If you can't stay in Ling An someday,

469
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,800
bring your family to Wu Rong and join me.

470
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,200
Your Highness is truly considerate.

471
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,240
I'm deeply grateful.

472
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,320
Then

473
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,840
if I need to find you in the future,

474
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,680
I should go to Lord Rui's residence, right?

475
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,240
Yes.

476
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,600
But

477
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,000
I've kept something from Your Highness.

478
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,240
I'm truly ashamed.

479
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,120
For certain reasons,

480
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,000
I had to disguise myself as a woman

481
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,360
and marry into the Rui family.

482
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,880
So the fact that I'm actually a man—

483
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,840
please keep it secret for me.

484
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:55,920
I didn't expect

485
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,600
you'd be in such a difficult situation,

486
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,080
yet still firmly refuse my offer.

487
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:04,960
So be it.

488
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,440
I've given up completely.

489
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,760
I promise you,

490
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,080
I'll keep your secret.

491
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,760
Then I shouldn't stay any longer.

492
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,680
I won't trouble you further.

493
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,160
Alright.

494
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,200
Let me see you off.

495
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,240
Let's go.

496
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,040
Though I've made up my mind,

497
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,480
Muya

498
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,920
truly has deep feelings for you.

499
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,000
I made things clear to her yesterday.

500
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,560
I have no feelings for the princess.

501
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,600
Then

502
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,440
if it's for the sake of our nations,

503
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,440
I

504
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,320
insist you marry Princess Muya?

505
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,880
Why go that far?

506
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,680
I already have someone I love.

507
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,760
And nothing will

508
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,720
diminish my feelings for her.

509
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,440
Please, Royal Brother,

510
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,280
advise the princess more.

511
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,600
I understand.

512
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:09,760
We

513
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,120
part ways here.

514
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,760
Young Master Beicheng.

515
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,360
Royal Brother, why are you stopping me?

516
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,040
Young Master Beicheng has explained everything.

517
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,000
You

518
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,920
Once we're back in Wu Rong,

519
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,680
I'll choose a husband for you.

520
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,280
Alright?

521
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,240
I don't want that.

522
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,120
The one I love

523
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,080
is Muya of Wu Rong.

524
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,240
Princess Muya,

525
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,480
you're a princess of the grasslands.

526
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,880
There will be braver warriors

527
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:36,800
who love you,

528
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:37,920
who respect you,

529
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,240
but that person won't be me.

530
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,120
Farewell.

531
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,160
Yu'er,

532
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:46,760
let's go.

533
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:47,800
Beicheng.

534
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,480
Enough.

535
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:49,400
Muya.

536
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,040
Let's go.

537
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:50,320
Royal Brother.

538
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,600
Listen to your brother.

539
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,600
Everyone has their own fate.

540
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,440
No need to feel sorry for her.

541
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,600
She'll find a better match.

542
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,160
Why did you come to Sifang Guest House?

543
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,160
Could it be

544
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:05,960
you are—

545
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,280
This all started because of me.

546
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,000
It should end with me as well.

547
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,120
Everything is resolved now.

548
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,080
You can rest easy.

549
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,240
Your Highness.

550
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,600
Lady Mei asked me to give this to you.

551
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,080
She said the rainy season is coming,

552
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,920
and worries your old illness may return.

553
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,120
She had me make knee guards for you.

554
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,000
Lady Mei said

555
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,280
Yesterday, King Wurong took the princess
to the Rui family and caused trouble.

556
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,560
She said

557
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,280
the Young Master Beicheng they're seeking
lives at the Rui residence.

558
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,560
They even drew swords.

559
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,320
Beicheng

560
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,560
Sounds like an alias.

561
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,280
North versus South.

562
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,680
City versus...

563
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,200
I recall Rui Yu returned to the Nan family
during New Year.

564
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,200
Nan Chenxiao wasn't with him.

565
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,280
Yes.

566
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,920
I've asked Lady Mei.

567
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,440
She said Nan Chenxiao left the city
to visit relatives.

568
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,600
Go investigate

569
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,800
which relatives the Nan family has
outside the city.

570
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,080
Prince, do you suspect Nan Chenxiao?

571
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,040
But...

572
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,640
But how could that be?

573
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,240
Rui Yu managed to deceive everyone
and become an official.

574
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,440
The Nan family did anything to avoid
the late emperor's wrath.

575
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,120
What wouldn't they dare to do?

576
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,360
If that's really the case,

577
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,960
then the Rui family is guilty
of deceiving the monarch.

578
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,320
In that case,

579
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,960
Lord Rui's true identity
may soon be exposed.

580
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,960
I've been in Ling An for so many years.

581
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,720
It's time I step forward

582
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,880
and mediate for them.

583
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,400
A few days ago,

584
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,840
I dreamed of my mother consort.

585
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,200
According to Ling An's customs,

586
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,080
I should burn some ingots
to comfort her spirit.

587
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,760
Tell me,

588
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,120
is my mother consort urging me

589
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,000
to return and see her?

590
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,600
Prince, you've planned for years.

591
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,360
Your wish will surely come true.

592
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,120
Take these to the ancestral hall

593
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:30,880
and burn them.

594
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,400
Yes.

595
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,520
Yingshu

596
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,680
Thank you for your hard work.

597
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,120
You mean

598
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,080
you wish to mediate between the two nations?

599
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:06,960
Yes.

600
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,440
I've lived in Ling An for many years.

601
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,000
My aunt also married into the Rui family.

602
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,520
Ling An, to me,

603
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,000
has long been a second home.

604
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,440
Of course, I wish to ease His Majesty's burdens.

605
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,680
Since you are sincere,

606
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,400
tomorrow

607
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,800
let's hold a banquet at Sifang Guest House.

608
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,800
Let's arrange a feast.

609
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,280
This time, King Wurong brought
Princess Muya with him.

610
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,200
Why not have each family bring
their own ladies?

611
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,280
To foster friendship between our nations.

612
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,920
Let us all join in this grand event.

613
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,400
Since you've thought of everything,

614
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,800
I have no reason to refuse.

615
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,640
We'll do as you suggest.

616
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,280
Thank you, Your Majesty.

617
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,400
Is it proper for me to attend
such a banquet?

618
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,800
I've already informed His Majesty.

619
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,360
Miss Qiao, you needn't worry.

620
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,040
Besides,

621
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,400
today's banquet—

622
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,000
His Majesty will also attend
the banquet today.

623
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,360
You haven't seen each other
in a long time.

624
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,720
Prime Minister Ming and the others
have arrived.

625
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,360
Lord Rui

626
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,000
Prime Minister Ming

627
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,480
This time, Lord Rui is in charge
of hosting King Wurong.

628
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,640
Lord Rui is the main organizer.

629
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,360
It's truly exhausting.

630
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,280
It's a lot of hard work.

631
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,000
It's all part of my duty.

632
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,880
It's right to share His Majesty's burdens.

633
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,760
I just didn't expect Prime Minister Ming

634
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,600
to attend this banquet as well.

635
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,760
After all, King Wurong

636
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,720
is a guest highly valued by His Majesty.

637
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,480
Yes.

638
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,040
The Left Minister is getting old

639
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,080
and dislikes such occasions.

640
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,800
So I must represent all officials

641
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,240
and show our hospitality.

642
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,280
Then...

643
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,560
Today, let's

644
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,800
not leave until we're drunk.

645
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,520
Prime Minister Ming, your kindness
is hard to refuse.

646
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,360
But this diplomatic banquet
is of great importance.

647
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,800
I'm afraid I can't drink freely
with you today.

648
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,560
His Majesty values you.

649
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,360
Alright then.

650
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,840
I won't disturb you further.

651
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,840
Prime Minister Ming, please.

652
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,200
Prime Minister Ming

653
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,080
Please, sit, sit.

654
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,840
Prime Minister Ming

655
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:19,920
Sit.

656
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,160
Yu'er

657
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,400
Do you see any issues?

658
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:32,960
No.

659
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,640
His Majesty has arrived.

660
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,880
King Wurong, you must drink
a few more cups today.

661
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,000
Please.

662
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,920
Greetings, Your Majesty.

663
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,800
Greetings, Your Majesty.

664
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,720
No need for formalities.

665
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,560
Everyone,

666
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,560
please take your seats.

667
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,600
Today, Prince Pan has specially
arranged this banquet

668
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,840
to host King Wurong and all officials.

669
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,600
Everyone, feel at ease.

670
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,800
Let the banquet begin.

671
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,160
You are...

672
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,160
Princess Muya.

673
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,440
Are you not interested
in these melodies?

674
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,680
I don't like them.

675
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,480
They're too dull.

676
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,280
Princess, please tell me
what you enjoy.

677
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,040
I will arrange it for you.

678
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,120
We Wurong people excel
at riding and archery.

679
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,040
Why not have someone from Ling An

680
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,600
compete with me in archery?

681
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:10,600
An archery contest?

682
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,080
Why not let Princess Chunxi
compete with her?

683
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,400
It's fair

684
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,400
and respectful.

685
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,400
Princess Muya is of noble status.

686
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,680
And today,

687
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,280
Princess Chunxi is also present.

688
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,680
Why not let the two princesses

689
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,560
compete against each other?

690
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:29,400
I...

691
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,560
I don't know how!

692
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,280
I'm only good at eating.

693
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:35,960
I can't do it.

694
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,960
But that doesn't mean all Ling An women can't.

695
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,720
Alright.

696
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,080
Then I'll choose a Ling An woman
from the crowd.

697
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,360
to compete with me.

698
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,200
Then...

699
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,440
Why not...

700
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,920
How about I compete with the princess?

701
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,280
What does the Monarch of Ling'an think?

702
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,960
As long as the princess enjoys herself.

703
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,440
Then you shall do it.
