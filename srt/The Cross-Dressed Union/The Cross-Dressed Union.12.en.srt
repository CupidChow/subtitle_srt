1
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,120
Chief, hurry and go!

2
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,720
Rui Yu

3
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,240
Rui Yu

4
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,040
Go!

5
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,480
Rui Yu

6
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,440
Hold on a little longer.

7
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,800
Rui Yu

8
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,160
Rui Yu, wake up!

9
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,240
I brought medicine to stop the bleeding.

10
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,320
You gave it to me.

11
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,720
The best medicine.

12
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,880
You’ll be fine, I promise.

13
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,400
Hang in there.

14
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,400
There’s a city ahead.

15
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,960
We’ll have a place to rest soon.

16
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,000
I’m sorry.

17
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,080
You’ve been through so much.

18
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,400
It’s me.

19
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,840
I’m the one who slowed you down.

20
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,120
Don’t say such nonsense.

21
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,560
If you hadn’t shielded me from that blade,

22
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,440
I’m afraid I...

23
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,640
I trust you.

24
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,480
You’ll definitely save me.

25
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,000
Let’s go.

26
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,080
Why did you call me out so early?

27
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,160
Your two younger brothers have been gone for months.

28
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,040
They should’ve been back by now.

29
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,080
Go ask around.

30
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,560
Maybe something delayed them.

31
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,520
Delayed by what?

32
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,480
They’re adults now.

33
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,080
I’m not worried, so why are you?

34
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,600
Look,

35
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,440
the messenger is back, isn’t he?

36
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,360
Honestly...

37
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,600
Bad fox.

38
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,480
It’s fine now.

39
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,640
What happened?

40
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,760
Where’s Rui Yu?

41
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,680
We were ambushed by bandits disguised as raiders.

42
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,320
Rui Yu and I

43
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,600
got separated.

44
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,360
What?

45
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,080
Let’s talk inside.

46
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,120
Sister-in-law,

47
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,760
please make some calming soup.

48
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,240
Alright, quickly!

49
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,920
Let’s go inside and talk.

50
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,440
Come.

51
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,480
What exactly happened?

52
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,520
Tell us quickly.

53
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,280
We were scattered by the raiders.

54
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,680
We went in two directions.

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,960
I escorted the princess straight to Su Zhou City.

56
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,000
Rui Yu and Nan

57
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,760
Chenxiao went the other way

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,760
to draw the raiders away.

59
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,560
The opposite direction from Su Zhou City.

60
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,720
So they headed toward Qiemo City.

61
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,400
Yes.

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,720
And with the raiders chasing them,

63
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,240
they couldn’t turn back.

64
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,040
So they had to keep heading north.

65
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,240
From Qiemo City

66
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,400
enter Ling An’s gate.

67
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,680
Qiemo

68
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,240
is independent from Ling An.

69
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,240
Qian Yuan

70
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,040
Pingxiang

71
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,480
outside the three kingdoms.

72
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,800
They’re not friendly to people from the three kingdoms.

73
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,960
And all their luggage is on the carriage.

74
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,240
They don’t have any identity documents with them.

75
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,960
You have so many connections.

76
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,880
Send someone to Qiemo City to find them!

77
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,920
Most of my people are in big cities like Qian Yuan and Pingxiang.

78
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,680
But small cities like Qiemo...

79
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,920
I really

80
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,480
don’t have a way.

81
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,000
For now,

82
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,640
we can only ask Your Majesty for help.

83
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,200
No.

84
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,960
This matter is too complicated.

85
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,280
Don’t alert Your Majesty for now.

86
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,560
But...

87
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,720
I do know a few jewel merchants.

88
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,960
Maybe they can get us into

89
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,160
Qiemo City.

90
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,240
Really?

91
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,920
That’s wonderful, then.

92
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,080
Rui Yu

93
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,520
Rui Yu

94
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,480
You’re awake.

95
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,920
We...

96
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,200
Where are we?

97
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,400
This is Qiemo City.

98
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,280
Don’t worry.

99
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,440
It’s very safe here.

100
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,440
Those raiders won’t come after us anymore.

101
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,640
Young Master Nan,

102
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,160
the medicine you wanted—

103
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,440
I got it for you.

104
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,640
Your wife is awake.

105
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,240
You are...

106
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,040
Come.

107
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:07,920
Careful.

108
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,880
I am Yang Ping.

109
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,000
A good friend of Young Master Nan.

110
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,720
During our days in Qiemo,

111
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,600
Yang Ping took great care of us.

112
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,240
Thank you so much.

113
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,120
It was nothing.

114
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,440
Compared to this,

115
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,600
Young Master Nan helped us a lot more.

116
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,760
That’s a huge difference.

117
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,040
Lady Nan,

118
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,200
you were unconscious and knew nothing.

119
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,800
A few days ago,

120
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,720
Young Master Nan showed wisdom and courage.

121
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,720
He helped Qiemo through a crisis.

122
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,040
He’s our great benefactor.

123
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,600
Chenxiao,

124
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,400
why are you out here?

125
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,640
You’ve just recovered from serious injuries.

126
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,320
You still need plenty of rest.

127
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,400
I’ve been lying down for so many days.

128
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,080
I’m a bit tired of it.

129
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,840
I wanted to come out and see the scenery.

130
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,280
Come, sit.

131
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,280
Be careful.

132
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,400
I asked Yang Ping

133
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,520
to find this book for you.

134
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,320
It records all of Qiemo’s

135
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,800
landforms.

136
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,800
Thank you.

137
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,800
No need to be so polite.

138
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,080
Yang Ping’s wife made this for you.

139
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,360
If you like it,

140
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,560
you can wear it.

141
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,560
They’ve cared for us so many days.

142
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,320
We should send them a gift in return.

143
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,160
Wait here for me, then.

144
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,560
I’ll go buy some things.

145
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,720
to give to them.

146
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,520
Alright.

147
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,280
Night patrols are well organized now.

148
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,360
The townsfolk

149
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,880
are much more at ease.

150
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,120
I'm grateful you listened to an outsider like me.

151
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,640
During the Ghost Weeping,

152
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,200
you set aside old customs

153
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,520
and increased patrols.

154
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:45,840
To survive,

155
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,440
we must adapt, after all.

156
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,760
Qiemo City sits at the border of three nations,

157
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,840
yet stands outside their rule.

158
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,720
It's a no-man's land.

159
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,520
None of them can be relied on.

160
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,360
We don't want to

161
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,600
just wait for doom.

162
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,000
What's wrong, Young Master Nan?

163
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,440
Your rattan armor—

164
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,520
did it come from the fallen Yunluo Ancient Kingdom?

165
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,800
Was it passed down from there?

166
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,240
Qiemo City gets intense sunlight.

167
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,400
Iron armor is heavy and cumbersome.

168
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,600
It's not suited for battle.

169
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,000
So this rattan armor

170
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,360
was crafted by our ancestors

171
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,760
after returning from Yunluo Ancient Kingdom.

172
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,960
Is there something wrong with it?

173
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,720
I've been pondering a question these days.

174
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,640
Yunluo Ancient Kingdom is a misty, rainy region.

175
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,680
Rattan armor works well there.

176
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,040
But Qiemo is hot,

177
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,240
and water is scarce.

178
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,120
It's highly flammable.

179
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,000
This rattan armor

180
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,920
could be a liability.

181
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,760
What should we do about that?

182
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,200
Military texts once recorded

183
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,960
if rattan armor

184
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,400
is soaked in tung oil for two days,

185
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,960
tung oil itself resists water and corrosion.

186
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,760
Rattan armor soaked in tung oil

187
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,440
becomes tougher.

188
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,880
It can withstand blades and spears.

189
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,720
But if there's a big fire,

190
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,560
it's still at risk of burning.

191
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,040
If fish scale plates

192
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,280
are sewn onto the outer layer,

193
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,880
making fish scale rattan armor,

194
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,680
then it would be fireproof.

195
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,400
Fish—

196
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,920
fish scale plates.

197
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,480
Is there a problem?

198
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,040
No, not at all.

199
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,640
Thank you, Young Master Nan.

200
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,280
Young Master Nan.

201
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,200
Mi Na.

202
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,160
What brings you here?

203
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,080
Young Master Nan,

204
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,000
Miss Rui is waiting for you by the river.

205
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:26,480
Alright.

206
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,200
Let's head out first.

207
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,080
Well then—

208
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,440
Young Master Nan,

209
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,000
You've worked hard washing so late.

210
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,600
Come with me to dry clothes by the river.

211
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,160
Sure.

212
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:45,840
Yu'er.

213
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,240
From tonight, the dew is white;

214
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,520
the moon of my homeland is brightest of all.

215
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,120
The ancients

216
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,080
always used moonlight to express longing.

217
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,440
I never felt it before,

218
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,120
but tonight,

219
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,800
I truly understand.

220
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,480
What's wrong?

221
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,200
I—

222
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,120
I'll never let you be in danger again.

223
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,000
I trust you.

224
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,600
This afternoon,

225
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,640
I learned to make clothes with Mi Na and the others.

226
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,760
I tried all afternoon, but nothing turned out right.

227
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,320
Before I go home,

228
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,560
I'll buy you a few more.

229
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,040
Let me see.

230
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,200
I think this is just fine.

231
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:10,680
Really?

232
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:12,840
Really.

233
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,920
What are you thinking about?

234
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,080
I'm thinking—

235
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,000
about what was mentioned earlier,

236
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,120
the fish scale plates.

237
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,320
When I said they improve fire resistance,

238
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,240
Yang Ping seemed troubled.

239
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,120
But he wouldn't say why.

240
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,440
So I didn't press him.

241
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,040
Qiemo City

242
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,040
is independent from Ling An,

243
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,240
Pingxiang,

244
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,120
and Qian Yuan—those three nations.

245
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,560
Though it's not

246
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,720
controlled by any of them,

247
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,080
it's still restricted.

248
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,840
They can't trade with the three nations.

249
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,840
Nor can they increase their forces.

250
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,280
So,

251
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,560
fish scale plates are

252
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,160
extremely rare for them.

253
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,800
I see.

254
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,440
Before,

255
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,600
I thought Qiemo was just a small nation

256
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,440
with its own way of life.

257
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,920
But now,

258
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,560
I understand.

259
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,760
Qiemo often suffers from bandit attacks.

260
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,360
We can't just stand by.

261
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,360
When I return,

262
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,880
I'll report to Your Majesty.

263
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,360
Maybe

264
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,240
we can open a trade route.

265
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,400
Really?

266
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,800
That would be best.

267
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,120
But the fish scale plates needed—

268
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,320
there are so many.

269
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,120
We can't gather them

270
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,120
all at once.

271
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,760
Second Brother's business

272
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,040
often goes to Jiangnan.

273
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,600
It shouldn't be a problem.

274
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,880
Trust me.

275
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,200
This way,

276
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,880
Qiemo's crisis can be solved.

277
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,360
My sister told me

278
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,560
during the days I was gravely injured and unconscious,

279
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,000
Qiemo City accused you of poisoning.

280
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,560
They made things difficult for you.

281
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,360
You had to serve and work.

282
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,040
Those bandits

283
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,600
weren't just after us—

284
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,200
they targeted Qiemo City too.

285
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,960
Luckily, the danger passed.

286
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,480
While I was unconscious,

287
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,200
for some reason,

288
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,560
I could only

289
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,800
hear your voice speaking to me.

290
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,880
Since the day you were hurt,

291
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,320
three days have passed.

292
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,920
I thought we'd be out of options.

293
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,320
But by sheer luck,

294
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,080
we found Qiemo City.

295
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,360
We're almost there.

296
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,000
I have lived my life with no regrets.

297
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,520
I only regret not having the chance

298
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,200
to spend my life by your side.

299
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,040
If I could,

300
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,200
I wish I had never brought you here.

301
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,720
Then you wouldn't have faced danger.

302
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,920
I'd rather be the one lying here.

303
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,840
When you wake up,

304
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,920
we'll return to Ling An.

305
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,040
I'll stay by your side,

306
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,760
and go nowhere else.

307
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,640
Once I take revenge,

308
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,440
I'll follow you wherever you go.

309
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,160
If you die,

310
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,440
I will not live alone.

311
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,480
When we were in danger by the river,

312
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,760
I don't know how I found such courage.

313
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,960
I rushed over in that instant,

314
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,400
lying right before your eyes.

315
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,920
Thinking back now,

316
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,920
I realize I'm just like you.

317
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,040
I'd rather suffer myself

318
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,160
than let you be hurt at all.

319
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,240
If I die,

320
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,200
you will not live alone.

321
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,200
I feel the same way.

322
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,120
Rui Yu.

323
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,560
What I promised you,

324
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,480
I will never break my word.

325
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,760
Trust me.

326
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,080
In a few days,

327
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,600
we can finally go home.

328
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,600
It will take time to gather all the fish scales.

329
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,560
I've already arranged everything.

330
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,040
Soak the rattan armor in tung oil.

331
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,600
Once the fish scales arrive,

332
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,240
we'll make fish scale rattan armor.

333
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,880
Then we'll be completely safe.

334
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,080
Qiemo City is a vital stronghold.

335
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,320
It must be well defended.

336
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,560
Young Master Nan is right.

337
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,120
Yang Ping will remember this.

338
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,160
Your great kindness to Qiemo City

339
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,440
will be remembered by all its people.

340
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,720
They will never forget it.

341
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:47,760
In the future,

342
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,080
you will always be honored guests here.

343
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,400
If you ever need anything,

344
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,440
Yang Ping

345
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,000
will follow you to the end.

346
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,960
We already have the map.

347
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,200
You don't need to escort us further.

348
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,680
Before we came,

349
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,600
the city lord instructed me

350
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,280
to see you safely to Ling An City.

351
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,400
But

352
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,080
the people of the city

353
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,320
are truly reluctant to see you go.

354
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,440
The two of us

355
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,280
are deeply moved by their kindness.

356
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,480
But we've been away from home for months.

357
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,520
We must return home to let them know we're safe.

358
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,520
So,

359
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,960
will you come back again?

360
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,920
You are a city guard.

361
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,000
You should understand

362
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,360
that the bustle of life

363
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,040
is not in parting,

364
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,960
but in meeting again.

365
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,520
If fate allows,

366
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,200
we will meet again.

367
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,120
Lady Nan is right.

368
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,640
Open the city gates.

369
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:54,920
Please, after you.

370
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:57,840
Hyah!

371
00:19:59,280 --> 00:19:59,760
Hyah!

372
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,000
Hyah!

373
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:02,880
Hyah!

374
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:05,720
Hyah!

375
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,240
Hyah!

376
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,640
Rui Wang!

377
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,520
Chenxiao!

378
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,760
Rui Yu!

379
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,000
I'm so glad you're both safe.

380
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,360
Now I can relax.

381
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:24,960
Wait,

382
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,520
what did you just call me?

383
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,840
After all this time apart,

384
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,440
you didn't even call me Second Brother.

385
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,720
That really makes me sad.

386
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,560
Here we go again.

387
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,640
Why are you here?

388
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,280
Let's talk about it later.

389
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,360
Right now, there's something

390
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,240
even more urgent.

391
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,680
What is it?

392
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,240
Eldest Brother is here too.

393
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,560
But he can't ride a horse.

394
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,600
He arrived just after me.

395
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,960
But it's only a short while apart.

396
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:51,720
You two,

397
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,240
go find a place over there

398
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,160
and change your clothes.

399
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,680
Why didn't you say so earlier?

400
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,920
Let's hurry and change.

401
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,600
You keep Eldest Brother calm.

402
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,640
Let's go, let's go.

403
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,480
So glad to be reunited.

404
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,880
During this time,

405
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,920
there have been many sighs.

406
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,600
This general from Qiemo City

407
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,240
is now our family guard.

408
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,160
Isn't that a bit odd?

409
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,640
And

410
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,880
why does he keep watching us?

411
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Just ignore him.

412
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,320
He won't leave

413
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,240
anytime soon.

414
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,280
Once Second Brother handles the documents,

415
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,280
he'll send him back.

416
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,200
I'm done with this.

417
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,480
I'd rather die than keep doing this.

418
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,360
What's going on?

419
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,400
Since Eldest Brother took over the Pingxiang timber trade,

420
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,520
this keeps happening.

421
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,640
Let's go take a look.

422
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,920
Is it proper for me to go too?

423
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,840
Why not?

424
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,080
Father is shouting and furious.

425
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,920
We should let Eldest Brother save face.

426
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,560
You're still not used to this?

427
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,640
Let's go.

428
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,880
Just kill me, just kill me.

429
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:00,960
I'll kill you!

430
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,120
I'll kill you!

431
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,160
Father!

432
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,320
Father! Father, Father!

433
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,000
Father!

434
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,240
If you have something to say, say it calmly.

435
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,760
He is still the eldest in the family.

436
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,200
You...

437
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,920
Show him some respect.

438
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,160
You all leave first.

439
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:13,800
Father.

440
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,200
Don't be angry, calm down.

441
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,360
I'll kill you!

442
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,560
Lord Rui

443
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,240
Aren't you going in?

444
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,920
Listening here is enough.

445
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Just treat it as watching the fun.

446
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,000
Lord Rui, always so composed,

447
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,680
is even joking now.

448
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,560
Times are changing.

449
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,280
Did I say something wrong?

450
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,120
If you can't use idioms,

451
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,360
then speak less.

452
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,240
What did I say wrong?

453
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,040
What is going on here?

454
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,320
Let him explain himself.

455
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,680
It's the second and third brothers

456
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,720
who found me a job.

457
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,440
I said no, but they insisted.

458
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,720
I'm exhausted.

459
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,480
Aren't you the one who loves this stuff?

460
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,480
Now you get to do it.

461
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,080
Why aren't you happy about it?

462
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,640
Do you know how much wood needs handling?

463
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,240
According to the higher-ups,

464
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,160
the wood must be processed well,

465
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,400
then designs made,

466
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,440
then carved out,

467
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,720
and finally counted.

468
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,880
Then sent to each country.

469
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:15,800
Even a donkey isn't as tired as me.

470
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,440
You suffer but get no respect.

471
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,200
It's a task from Your Majesty.

472
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,200
Only two days in and you're complaining.

473
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,520
No ambition at all.

474
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,480
Besides, you're not working alone.

475
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,000
There are so many skilled craftsmen.

476
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,120
You're just overseeing them.

477
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,720
And you can't handle it.

478
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,240
No ambition.

479
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,640
When a hobby

480
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,440
becomes a career,

481
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,280
your passion slowly fades.

482
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,480
Once someone loses

483
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,360
what reason is left?

484
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,720
Didn't you promise not to get physical?

485
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,160
Why are you throwing things again?

486
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,440
Honestly...

487
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,760
Husband,

488
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,680
in all of Ling An City,

489
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,440
no one suits this job better than you.

490
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,120
You know the goods,

491
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,320
and have the skills.

492
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,920
Once the alliance trade is settled,

493
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,640
Your Majesty will make you an official.

494
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,520
How glorious for your family!

495
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,520
Where was I?

496
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,400
The passion in your heart

497
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,680
will slowly fade away.

498
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,840
Once someone loses passion,

499
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,680
they become like a walking corpse.

500
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,000
What use are you to this family?

501
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:18,800
Lady Nan,

502
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,760
Yes, beat him!

503
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,040
Lady Nan, Lady Nan!

504
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,080
You’re really something!

505
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,480
You're just asking for trouble.

506
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,440
Feeling itchy, huh?

507
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,040
Come here!

508
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,600
Stand there, stand still!

509
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,400
What's going on?

510
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,240
This...

511
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,280
Lady Nan,

512
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:33,720
Come back!

513
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,960
Don't hit me, I get it!

514
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,800
Wait till I beat you!

515
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,160
This situation...

516
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,000
It's not right for us to come again.

517
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,760
Looks like the house will be lively for a while.

518
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,640
Yeah.

519
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,640
No idea where Second Brother went.

520
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,520
Haven't seen him in a while.

521
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,440
Let's go back to Taoran Courtyard.

522
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,120
Alright.

523
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,680
Today we received a secret letter from Chongming.

524
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,840
The Pingxiang envoy

525
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,960
has passed safely.

526
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,760
With the state-sealed national letter

527
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,720
and returned to report.

528
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,080
With this,

529
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,280
the trade agreement between the two countries

530
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,600
is now fully settled.

531
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,960
Second Brother has bought the first batch of fish scale rattan armor.

532
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,160
Eldest Brother found a trusted gem merchant.

533
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,920
Once the fish scale armor is made,

534
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,280
it can be sent as "jewelry"

535
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,720
and secretly delivered to Qiemo.

536
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,680
Thank you.

537
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,720
Your Majesty.

538
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,440
What other tasks did you get?

539
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,880
Secretly assist Second Brother

540
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,640
and monitor the officials in the capital.

541
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,160
They call it leading the Chongming Guard,

542
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,880
but thinking about it,

543
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,600
it feels like Second Brother is just using me.

544
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,200
And it's not even official.

545
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,640
But you can finally serve the country.

546
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,560
Congratulations, Young Master Nan.

547
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,040
It's all thanks to Lord Rui's support.

548
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,080
Only then could I

549
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,840
try my hand at this.

550
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:54,760
Brother Rui,

551
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:56,920
over here.

552
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,440
General Qiao and General Qian

553
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,680
were taken away by the Ministry of Justice.
