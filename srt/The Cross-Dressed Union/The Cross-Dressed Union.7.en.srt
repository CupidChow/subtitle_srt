1
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:39,960
Honored officials,

2
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,360
today,

3
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,880
I truly failed to consider this matter fully.

4
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,760
I had thought

5
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,280
this season was perfect for tasting mushrooms
and enjoying the outdoors.

6
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,480
I never expected

7
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,640
it would put the Prince in danger.

8
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,480
Please rest assured,

9
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,520
I will immediately send someone

10
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,880
to fetch a physician.

11
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,080
For all of you,

12
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,680
after each of you is examined,

13
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,360
you will be escorted home.

14
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,480
Prince,

15
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,160
please stay at my residence tonight.

16
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,200
Once the physician arrives and prescribes medicine,

17
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,800
we will assess the situation.

18
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,760
No need.

19
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,240
Please just have someone escort me home.

20
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,600
Medicine brewed in Madam Rui's kitchen—

21
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,440
I dare not drink it either.

22
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,080
You—

23
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,000
Prince.

24
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,000
Attendants!

25
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,000
Liang Jin,

26
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,640
go fetch the physician at once.

27
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,200
Be gentle!

28
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,320
Yes, sir.

29
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,880
Prince, please.

30
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,480
Is Zizhai feeling better?

31
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,120
Yes, Aunt.

32
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,000
Prince, be careful.

33
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,680
Don't run so fast.

34
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,560
Hurry up!

35
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,080
So childish.

36
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,600
How boring, I didn't even scare you.

37
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,080
This suits you.

38
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,000
Wicked fox.

39
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,200
Does it suit me?

40
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,240
Yes, it does.

41
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,640
Look, wicked fox—

42
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,400
Is this one pretty?

43
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,680
It's pretty.

44
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,320
Boss, we'll take these two masks.

45
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,400
There are so many people.

46
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,480
Hold my sleeve so you don't get lost.

47
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,280
It's fine.

48
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,040
Let's hurry.

49
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,160
There are still so many things.

50
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:37,680
Let's go!

51
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,800
Hurry, hurry!

52
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,040
Faster!

53
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,120
Make way!

54
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,080
Be careful.

55
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,720
You wicked fox!

56
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,320
This is—

57
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,960
a little rabbit.

58
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,920
Its eyes are both red.

59
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,920
Doesn't it look like you?

60
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,640
Can't you say something nice

61
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,760
to cheer me up?

62
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,960
Thank you, wicked fox.

63
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,200
It's getting late.

64
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:42,960
Princess,

65
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,400
you should return to the palace.

66
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,320
Princess,

67
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,520
we should head back.

68
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,360
Let's go.

69
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,960
Can I still visit you at Rui Residence?

70
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,680
As long as it's not to see Third Brother,

71
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,560
I always welcome your visit, Princess.

72
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,800
Got it.

73
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,600
Thank you, Second Young Master Rui.

74
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,200
You were a great help today.

75
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,280
You flatter me, Master.

76
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,040
But—

77
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,000
the Princess's carriage has already left.

78
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,080
Master, perhaps—

79
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,920
I'll head off first.

80
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,240
Wait for me!

81
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,600
Wait for me!

82
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,200
I messed it up.

83
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,400
It's not your fault.

84
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,240
Ming Qiuhao and the others

85
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,280
came prepared.

86
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,520
They can't stand civil and military officials
sitting together.

87
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,680
They insist on smearing the military officers.

88
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,280
When the spy failed to poison,

89
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,600
they deliberately made the Prince

90
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,040
eat undercooked mushrooms.

91
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,360
Doesn't that mean this banquet...

92
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,800
Of course not.

93
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,680
Father and General Qiao

94
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,200
and my colleagues at the Hanlin Academy

95
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,400
all get along very well.

96
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,080
And a few other officials

97
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,840
have changed their views

98
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,040
about the military officers.

99
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,480
Isn't there a saying among the people?

100
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,440
One bite

101
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,880
won't make you fat.

102
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,720
Let's take it slow.

103
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,080
If we promote the Military Imperial Exam,

104
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,440
success is just around the corner.

105
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,440
So, can we...

106
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,600
Today was exhausting.

107
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,720
Can we go to bed now?

108
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,600
Of course.

109
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:34,880
Go ahead.

110
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,000
I'll return to my courtyard.

111
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,520
It's rude not to reciprocate.

112
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:38,920
Come.

113
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:39,760
I'll walk you back.

114
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,840
No need.

115
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,000
Master Rui, don't refuse.

116
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,720
You are the hero today.

117
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,400
I'll give you a shoulder massage later.

118
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,280
Take a look.

119
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,160
Do you want any of these?

120
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,920
You don't want any of these?

121
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,280
Lately,

122
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,560
I've been heartbroken by scholars.

123
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,640
I just want to see the wide world.

124
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,520
It'd be best to meet

125
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,280
a brave man like General of the Cloud Banner.

126
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,280
See if there's anything you want.

127
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,800
If you don't want any,

128
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,640
I'll just throw them all away.

129
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,440
Throw them all away?

130
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,080
What will Princess read in the future?

131
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,800
In the storybooks,

132
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,440
it's all fake and empty.

133
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,000
I want to leave the palace and see the real world.

134
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,640
Wang Guanshan just released a new storybook.

135
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,640
Should I get it for Princess to read?

136
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,080
What storybook?

137
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,280
Didn't I say before,

138
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,080
except for Pearl Princess,

139
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,720
I don't read any others.

140
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,920
The old Hidden Gazette and Scenery Collection—

141
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,800
Are they still in the palace?

142
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,080
Xuanbao Pavilion has them all.

143
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,560
Go fetch them for me.

144
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,360
Yes.

145
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,200
Your Highness.

146
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,640
Your Majesty is inside reviewing memorials.

147
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,360
I'm not going in.

148
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,120
I'm just here to bring my royal brother some snacks.

149
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,800
Pan Zi Zhai, what nerve.

150
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,880
He actually dares to ask for Yan Luo's hand.

151
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,520
Your Majesty.

152
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,880
Have some tea.

153
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,320
One says

154
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,120
he wants to marry Yan Luo.

155
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,880
Another wants Yan Luo to wed Qian Yuan's second prince.

156
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,000
Is Qian Yuan really that threatening to me?

157
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,880
Left Minister.

158
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,200
It's also for Ling An.

159
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,080
Left Minister.

160
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:25,760
Your Majesty.

161
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,880
Don't let anger harm your health.

162
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,960
Such wolfish ambition.

163
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,800
I might as well

164
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,080
let Yan Luo marry into Pingxiang.

165
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,560
That way, he won't keep thinking about her.

166
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,120
Your Highness.

167
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,200
Your Highness, where are you going?

168
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,120
Your Highness.

169
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,320
Why is Yan Luo outside?

170
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,800
Maybe she just arrived.

171
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,960
Send someone to follow her.

172
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,240
Make sure nothing goes wrong.

173
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,440
Yes.

174
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,680
If Princess wants to leave the palace?

175
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,880
Let her go.

176
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,560
Just keep her safe.

177
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,680
Yes.

178
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,080
Take care, sir.

179
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,240
Slow down.

180
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,680
Anyone here?

181
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,560
Your tiger and wolf wood carving, two qian.

182
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,760
We didn't order this.

183
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,000
You delivered to the wrong place.

184
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,440
Wait a moment.

185
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,960
Delivered wrong?

186
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,200
That can't be right.

187
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,360
Let me check.

188
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,000
Look.

189
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,440
Isn't this your place?

190
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,320
You got the wrong address.

191
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,760
It's not our order.

192
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,560
Sir.

193
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,080
If you don't mind,

194
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,200
just take it for me.

195
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,200
Hurry and leave.

196
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,800
How did you know I was here?

197
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,320
Well, I am

198
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,840
I just asked around.

199
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,800
I'm heading back to Rui Manor now.

200
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,800
Can I go with you?

201
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,280
You snuck out again.

202
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,320
Aren't you worried your brother and mother will worry?

203
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:02,960
I...

204
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,400
I just wanted to clear my mind.

205
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,080
What's wrong?

206
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,040
I...

207
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,680
I might have to marry for alliance.

208
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,280
Marry...

209
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,800
Go to...

210
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,080
Is it somewhere far away?

211
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,200
I don't know.

212
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,080
But...

213
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,080
In storybooks, those marriages

214
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,320
never end well.

215
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,280
And I'm my royal brother's only sister.

216
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,560
Thank you, wicked fox.

217
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,280
Other than Brother Yu,

218
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,200
you're the first to really listen to me.

219
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,320
Oh, right.

220
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:08,960
You—

221
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,080
what do you like about Yu?

222
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,280
Honestly,

223
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,920
he reminds me of the scholar in

224
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,440
Wang Guanshan's "The Handsome Scholar."

225
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,920
But now there's a new story about a general.

226
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,560
General of the Cloud Banner.

227
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,040
The scene where he saves the Princess from bandits—

228
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,800
so heroic!

229
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,800
The author is truly talented.

230
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,320
Yeah.

231
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,040
Maybe he's a genius.

232
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,560
That's right.

233
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,440
Come on.

234
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,800
I'll take you for a walk by the river.

235
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:56,920
Let's go.

236
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,080
I shall take my leave.

237
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,320
It's getting late.

238
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,800
Why not just stay here tonight?

239
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,160
Sure.

240
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,200
I'll go get things ready.

241
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,600
What's there to prepare?

242
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,200
Mother has your room cleaned every day.

243
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,840
You can just go to bed.

244
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,080
Madam.

245
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:26,680
This...

246
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,800
Isn't this improper?

247
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,280
What's wrong with it?

248
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,160
Shouldn't a young couple share a room?

249
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,440
Why would you sleep apart?

250
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,800
People might think you're fighting.

251
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,040
You're not fighting, are you?

252
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,320
No.

253
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,200
No, not at all.

254
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,320
Alright.

255
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,080
As your mother, I'll decide.

256
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,200
You'll stay at home tonight.

257
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,440
Hus—

258
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,720
Husband, do you have anything to add?

259
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,680
Let Xiaoxiao handle the rest.

260
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,840
You two should rest early.

261
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,320
I'll take your father for a walk to digest.

262
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,320
Got it, Mother.

263
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,320
Rui Yu is frail.

264
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,440
Take good care of him.

265
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,680
Don't overexert yourselves.

266
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:19,440
You—

267
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,920
Mother, what are you saying?

268
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,560
You just have to get the hint, right?

269
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,480
Yes, yes, Madam, you're right.

270
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,160
Well...

271
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,320
I...

272
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,560
Let me take you somewhere.

273
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,480
Okay.

274
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,080
Be careful not to catch a chill.

275
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,080
I'm not that weak!

276
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,680
I was just pretending before.

277
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,400
To a martial artist,

278
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,560
your small frame—

279
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,680
even a punch's wind

280
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,040
could knock you down.

281
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,480
My mother loves gardening.

282
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,400
So my father built

283
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,600
a garden pavilion for her here.

284
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,440
The garden's layout is unique.

285
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,680
Father really put his heart into it.

286
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,680
And

287
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,680
the flowers are all beautiful.

288
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,480
When I was little,

289
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,800
I accidentally killed a peony.

290
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,440
It was Mother's favorite.

291
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:45,800
Mother,

292
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,200
I let this flower die.

293
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,440
When she found out,

294
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,440
she was sad for a long time.

295
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,200
Let's grow another one.

296
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:51,680
Madam.

297
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,680
Father saw it.

298
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,920
He chased me with a broom.

299
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,200
I'll teach you a lesson today!

300
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,200
Don't run!

301
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,680
Stop hitting!

302
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,560
Sir!

303
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,200
Don't run, don't run!

304
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,200
What are you doing, sir?

305
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,200
Father chased me around.

306
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,440
Don't hit him!

307
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,280
Sir!

308
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,200
Then Mother saw me crying.

309
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,200
She cried even harder.

310
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,400
Stop your nonsense!

311
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,680
Not working, is it?

312
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,200
You really are something.

313
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,440
It works, it works.

314
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,480
Mother.

315
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,960
Where does it hurt?

316
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,560
Father really cares about Mother.

317
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,320
But...

318
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,840
Why do you always cause trouble?

319
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,560
As a child, I hated pretending to be a girl.

320
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,200
It made Mother worry every day.

321
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,320
Later, she became absent-minded.

322
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,560
She thought she really had a daughter.

323
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,680
She taught me needlework,

324
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,400
tea brewing,

325
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,320
and all sorts of things.

326
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,440
Yu,

327
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,440
look at that fish pond.

328
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,080
I remember

329
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,320
when I was eight,

330
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,280
I got mad at my father

331
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,040
and ate all the fish in it.

332
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,160
He was so angry, he gave me a beating.

333
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,560
I couldn't get out of bed for three days.

334
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,480
And...

335
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,720
Why are you laughing?

336
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,200
I'm laughing

337
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,560
because you're so mischievous and cute.

338
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,800
Your childhood must've been fun.

339
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,440
Did you have any fun stories as a child?

340
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,560
I...

341
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,200
You were born into a scholarly family,

342
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,800
and your older brothers are interesting.

343
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,680
You must've been happy too.

344
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,600
I...

345
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,200
When I was very young,

346
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,400
my mother passed away.

347
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,160
In my memory,

348
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,080
my father always had

349
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,800
a stern, unsmiling face.

350
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,040
So,

351
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,160
there weren't really any fun stories.

352
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,200
I just remember being in the study

353
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,440
reading book after book.

354
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,800
It felt endless.

355
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,720
Naturally,

356
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,320
I rarely spoke with my brothers.

357
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,280
Later on,

358
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,560
Your Majesty granted our marriage.

359
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,800
So I married you.

360
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,080
Looking back now,

361
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,960
it all feels like a dream.

362
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,240
You

363
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,720
Be careful not to fall.

364
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,000
I know.

365
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,480
But speaking of it,

366
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,680
seeing from such a height

367
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,200
really gives a different view.

368
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,360
I've made up my mind.

369
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,600
I don't want to be just your brother.

370
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,760
Nor do I want us to be strangers.

371
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,640
I want us to be a real married couple.

372
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,840
Like my father and mother,

373
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,440
loving each other till old age.

374
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,000
I...

375
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,720
Say something, will you?

376
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,680
Do you think I haven't done well enough,

377
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,360
or are you unhappy with me?

378
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,440
N-no.

379
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,680
No.

380
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,680
I'm not.

381
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,440
I just feel

382
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,400
it's not the right time yet.

383
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,480
I...

384
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,280
I'm not ready yet.

385
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,520
I also...

386
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,000
don't know what to do.

387
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,400
If you can't say no,

388
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,280
then let's just stay like this.

389
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,440
It doesn't seem so bad.

390
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,840
You don't need to do anything.

391
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,120
Leave everything to me.

392
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:54,960
If that's the case,

393
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,400
are you willing?

394
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,960
Then...

395
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,200
Then...

396
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,640
I'll try.

397
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,200
The full moon is in two days.

398
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:24,960
Look.

399
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,200
It's beautiful.

400
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,000
Mother picked the softest quilt for you.

401
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,520
She even fluffed new cotton.

402
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,680
The weather has changed now.

403
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,680
The night is cold and damp.

404
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,640
With this quilt, you won't catch cold.

405
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,360
Mother is so thoughtful.

406
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,440
Do you need anything else?

407
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,720
I'll go tell Mother.

408
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,240
No need to trouble yourself.

409
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,360
The moon is lovely tonight.

410
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,880
Why aren't you done yet?

411
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,680
Finish and leave quickly.

412
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,440
Yes, yes.

413
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,680
I just remembered.

414
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,720
Madam just said

415
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,840
you should go talk with her in her room.

416
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,000
Then go keep Mother company.

417
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,680
Is that true?

418
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,760
Really.

419
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,640
Alright then.

420
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,640
I'll go check first.

421
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,520
Go, go.

422
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,360
Did you make it up, or did Mother really call me?

423
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,520
Of course I made it up.

424
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,000
That's good.

425
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,440
Go on with your work.

426
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,960
Are you staying?

427
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,600
At least you're married in name.

428
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,520
It's just...

429
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,240
It's not right to leave her alone here.

430
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,200
Didn't you two sleep separately before?

431
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,160
Mother.

432
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:17,960
Greetings, Madam.

433
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,640
Fulu.

434
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,160
Why are you still here?

435
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:20,840
I...

436
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,040
Um...

437
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,360
Fulu said you missed me.

438
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,440
and wanted me to come to your room

439
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,680
to talk privately with you.

440
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,600
I was just about to come see you.

441
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,160
When did I ever say that?

442
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,480
Even if I miss you,

443
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,120
you can't leave your husband alone in the room.

444
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,880
You've only been married a few months.

445
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,680
What would people think if they heard?

446
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,400
Go inside, quickly.

447
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,120
Uh...

448
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,200
Isn't this inappropriate?

449
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,640
What's wrong with it?

450
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,000
Just go in, hurry.

451
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,240
Listen to Mother and go in.

452
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,680
You should go to bed too.

453
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,160
I still have to guard the door.

454
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,920
Guard what door?

455
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:07,720
Well...

456
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,680
You never had to guard before.

457
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,880
Go on, go to sleep.

458
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,160
Yes.

459
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,040
Let's go.

460
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,880
What's going on?

461
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,120
Prince.

462
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:52,920
Let's go.

463
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,280
Prince, Prince!

464
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,280
I arrived late.

465
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,040
It's fine.

466
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,640
Turn around.

467
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,400
Why didn't you...

468
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,680
I just finished talking with Mother.

469
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,440
Just got back.

470
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,760
Then tonight,

471
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,280
I'll sleep on the couch.

472
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,160
Why sleep on the couch when there's a bed?

473
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,200
Uh...

474
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,240
It's your room, after all.

475
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,680
Before,

476
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,880
you always slept on the couch.

477
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,640
It's not right to make you sleep there forever.

478
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,400
If you're not sleepy,

479
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,440
let's

480
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,000
chat for a while.

481
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,640
Sure.

482
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,160
Why are you tongue-tied all of a sudden?

483
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,920
Where did your confession courage go?

484
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:57,960
Prince.

485
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,360
Did you get anything out of them?

486
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,640
They all took poison and killed themselves.

487
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,040
But I saw on their abdomens

488
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,600
the Qian Yuan totem.
