1
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,520
What are you talking about?

2
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,400
I...

3
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,800
I don't understand at all.

4
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,400
Father,

5
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,880
please don't worry.

6
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,440
This imperial marriage

7
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,280
was granted by the Emperor
on purpose.

8
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,440
His aim

9
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,040
is to support the generals.

10
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,480
Ever since we first returned
from Pingxiang,

11
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,520
Nan Chenxiao

12
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,680
has held command of
the Chongming Guard.

13
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,400
Now he serves
the Emperor.

14
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,200
He has been waiting for the day
the Military Imperial Examination returns,

15
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,840
so he can fight as a man
on the battlefield

16
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,280
and restore the Nan family's honor.

17
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,800
What you said,

18
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,000
is it really true?

19
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,880
Every word is true.

20
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,720
Nan Chenxiao's trip this time

21
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,880
is to carry out a mission
for the Emperor.

22
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,760
If you don't believe me,

23
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,440
this is Nan Chenxiao's
own letter.

24
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,760
Please take a look.

25
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,040
It really is Chenxiao's
handwriting.

26
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,160
Good.

27
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,400
Good indeed.

28
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,200
Our Nan family finally
has hope again.

29
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,680
It's just that

30
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,040
this marriage of yours...

31
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,920
Before the great cause succeeds,

32
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,680
this marriage

33
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,640
must go on as an act.

34
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,000
That's true.

35
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,280
You've helped us so much.

36
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,240
Even without this marriage,

37
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,640
by now we

38
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,600
are already family.

39
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,520
I may not be very capable,

40
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,440
but in the imperial court

41
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,640
I'll try my best not
to trouble you.

42
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,400
What are you two talking about?

43
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,760
You've talked for so long.

44
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,200
We were just talking

45
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,480
about court affairs.

46
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,160
What is this?

47
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,640
A secret.

48
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,840
Hurry and go out.

49
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,160
Go on.

50
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,000
Madam, I...

51
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,480
Rui Yu, sit down.

52
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,160
I have something for you.

53
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,560
Come, put this on.

54
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,000
Mother,

55
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,000
I really can't wear this.

56
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,680
It wouldn't be right.

57
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,720
Put it on.

58
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,440
Your hands are slim
and slender.

59
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,520
The bracelet looks
lovely on you.

60
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:17,920
I...

61
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,120
This bracelet

62
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,840
was part of my dowry
when I married.

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,360
It is the one I cherish most.

64
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,840
I always meant to save it
for my daughter‑in‑law.

65
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,000
Mother...

66
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,200
I...

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,880
I just miss my son.

68
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,160
I don't even know

69
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,280
when Xingxiao
will be back.

70
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,960
My royal brother is
reviewing memorials,

71
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,120
Mother is sleeping,

72
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,080
and I can't leave
the palace.

73
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,320
This is far too boring.

74
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,360
What is that bad fox doing?

75
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,040
He must be out
playing in the streets,

76
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,000
running into lots
of fun things.

77
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,200
My heart is a web
of longing.

78
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,520
In time it will tie
into endless knots.

79
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,320
Bad fox, I saw it.

80
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,120
Bad fox, I saw it.

81
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,680
I...

82
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,840
Bad fox,

83
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,680
I saw it.

84
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,040
Little bunny,

85
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,800
I wish you peace
and joy,

86
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,280
and that you will
meet your true love.

87
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,840
I can copy
your handwriting,

88
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,960
but I can never replace
your presence.

89
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,600
Nan Chenxiao,

90
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,600
where on earth are you?

91
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,040
If you are dead,

92
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,160
what am I supposed to do?

93
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,320
I'm sorry.

94
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,680
If I die,

95
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,920
this marriage

96
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,040
will no longer exist.

97
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,240
I...

98
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,320
I also hope you can make the Military

99
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,040
Imperial Examination go smoothly

100
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,240
and be fully implemented.

101
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,760
My wish now

102
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,720
is simply to fulfill yours.

103
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,080
Capital Guard Commander Zou Qingyu

104
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,320
requested retirement due to injury

105
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,280
and returned home before last year.

106
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,720
The Metropolitan Governor post

107
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,880
has also been vacant since then.

108
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,640
I hope, Your Majesty,

109
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,760
you will select successors soon.

110
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,000
My ministers, do you have nominees?

111
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,720
I recommend Sub‑Governor Wang Yisheng

112
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,720
and Suzhou Vice Prefect He Zhiqiu,

113
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,320
whose conduct and ability are excellent,

114
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,200
either could serve as Metropolitan Governor.

115
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,320
The Censor’s wife is Ming Qiuhao’s cousin.

116
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,200
The Vice Minister of Rites is unrelated

117
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,120
but He Zhiqiu studied under his master.

118
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,040
I instead recommend

119
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,360
Hanlin Academician Liu Zhi as Governor.

120
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,840
Liu Zhi

121
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,320
tried several cases the Left Minister backed.

122
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,000
Replying to Your Majesty,

123
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,400
that is correct.

124
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,760
Where is Liu Zhi?

125
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,360
Fourth‑rank Hanlin Academician Liu Zhi

126
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,560
greets Your Majesty.

127
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,360
You judged that case quite well.

128
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,440
In that case,

129
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,760
you shall be Metropolitan Governor.

130
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,960
Report to your post tomorrow.

131
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,640
I

132
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,800
obey Your Majesty’s decree.

133
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,320
For Capital Guard Commander,

134
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,560
I recommend Vice Minister Wei Ming.

135
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,240
Though Wei Ming serves in the Ministry,

136
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,760
he is not versed in military affairs.

137
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,480
The capital region is too critical.

138
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,880
General Nan,

139
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,000
you shall assume this command.

140
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,080
I

141
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,520
am already advanced in years,

142
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,280
I fear I cannot manage it.

143
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,840
General Nan is in his prime

144
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,800
and can bear this commander’s post.

145
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,280
I

146
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,960
accept the decree.

147
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,880
This time you dragged me onto your ship.

148
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,520
Yet once the edict was issued,

149
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,440
I instead felt full of drive.

150
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,560
Lord Liu,

151
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,520
you should have felt so long ago.

152
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,880
Lord Rui is right about that.

153
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,560
General Nan,

154
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,400
His Majesty meant me for Guard Commander.

155
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,680
Why did you not warn me earlier?

156
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,680
I also only learned

157
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,320
in court today.

158
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,240
But this is a good thing.

159
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,240
With Father in an important post,

160
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,920
others won’t trouble him so easily.

161
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,960
I only fear you’ll be targeted

162
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,720
and dragged into trouble for him.

163
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,400
If soldiers come, the general blocks.

164
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,640
If floods come, earth dams them.

165
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,960
We’ll counter each move as it comes.

166
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:54,760
Let’s go.

167
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,640
I wish to appoint the worthy

168
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,640
from the new generation of officials

169
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,600
to mend the civil‑military rift

170
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,080
and thereby advance the Military Exam.

171
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,560
Lord Rui,

172
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,200
there is one thing I still doubt.

173
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,040
You are the Left Minister’s disciple,

174
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,160
and deeply favored by the Emperor.

175
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,200
Why

176
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,840
would you choose to support me?

177
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,720
Because you are upright

178
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,840
and have no bias against generals,

179
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:29,840
and

180
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,480
you never join factional strife.

181
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,360
What the court lacks most today

182
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,000
is forthright officials like you.

183
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,040
Your name truly suits your nature.

184
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,000
The time has come.

185
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,480
Enter the hall.

186
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,480
You all sit for this exam today

187
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,240
for the sake of your future,

188
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,400
and for Ling An’s future.

189
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,120
Whether you pass the list or not,

190
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,640
hold rites and law in your hearts,

191
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,200
revere the Emperor’s grace,

192
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,840
and you will see it through.

193
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,640
Announce the topic.

194
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,160
Today’s palace examination topic is:

195
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,800
“The way to secure the nation’s army.”

196
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,400
Your Highness, please.

197
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,160
Prime Minister Ming.

198
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,160
Please, Minister Ming.

199
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,600
is the way to secure a mighty army.

200
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,880
This is what Rui Yu is doing.

201
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,120
He wants to start with the exams

202
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,160
to push for the Military Imperial Exam,

203
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,200
cultivating new forces for himself.

204
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:19,840
Well?

205
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,960
Your Highness, even now

206
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,720
you still want to win Rui Yu over?

207
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,080
Minister Ming,

208
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,800
how could I be so short‑sighted?

209
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,040
Come.

210
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,520
To get this done,

211
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,520
you’ll need both money and men.

212
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,760
Your Highness should care more about it.

213
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,360
Yes.

214
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,280
I still have matters to attend to.

215
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,280
I shall take my leave first.

216
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,400
Minister Ming, take care.

217
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,200
This Ming Qiuhao

218
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,000
is actually so rude to Your Highness.

219
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,040
He is the chancellor of a strong state;

220
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,280
why would he value a mere hostage prince?

221
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,480
In fact,

222
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,440
if Your Highness truly fancies Lord Rui,

223
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,960
why not expose her true identity?

224
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,480
Then you two could—

225
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,240
That would only make her hate me more.

226
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,040
It would also harm the greater cause.

227
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,680
Only once I become Prince Qian Yuan

228
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,080
can I marry her without wronging her.

229
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,120
Elder Brother,

230
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,080
any boat crossing this river,

231
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,640
I’ll cut it in two without mercy.

232
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,240
Charge!

233
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,480
Pass down the order:

234
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,960
the King of Da Yue is dead.

235
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,360
All who surrender to Wu Rong

236
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,560
shall be treated with favor.

237
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,360
Young Master Beicheng,

238
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,880
why not stay here

239
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,800
and conquer these grasslands with me?

240
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,320
Father,

241
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,120
Lady Ming is here as well.

242
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,480
Your Highness.

243
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:56,760
You may go.

244
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,720
I have matters to discuss with him.

245
00:17:59,320 --> 00:17:59,800
Yes.

246
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,200
Your son will take his leave.

247
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,560
Please, sit.

248
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,640
You were so eager to see me,

249
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,800
what is this about?

250
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,280
My men sent word to me:

251
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,040
this time the scripts’ review

252
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,400
was done solely by Rui Yu.

253
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,680
And my own protégés?

254
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,600
Only three even made the list.

255
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,480
Given Lord Rui’s way of doing things,

256
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,960
this is also within

257
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,160
what one would expect.

258
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,680
These three men,

259
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,680
I can place them in key posts.

260
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,040
But the top three

261
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,240
are all from humble families.

262
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,200
Rui Yu is chief examiner of this Spring Exam,

263
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,600
so these three men

264
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,760
are effectively his protégés.

265
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,520
No vested interest can threaten them.

266
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,240
So, Lord Ming,

267
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,120
what do you intend to do?

268
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,000
Kill them.

269
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,320
As for who ranks first,

270
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,560
the Emperor will decide.

271
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,440
But

272
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,600
it can’t be anyone but these three.

273
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,560
Killing them before the exam ends,

274
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,200
such a big move—

275
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,800
I fear my men will be exposed.

276
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:23,680
Minister Ming,

277
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,080
it must be done before results are posted.

278
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,800
Once these three are dead,

279
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,000
the vacant spots are filled,

280
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,560
and Rui Yu alone won’t decide it.

281
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,320
Of course,

282
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,720
to leave no loose ends,

283
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,840
we must rely on Your Highness’s skill.

284
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:41,920
Minister Ming,

285
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,440
if we startle the snake in the grass,

286
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,240
we’ll suffer heavy losses too.

287
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,720
So please think twice, Minister.

288
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,200
They’ve already taken the post of
Metropolitan Governor.

289
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,720
If a few more newbies enter the Six
Ministries,

290
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,560
once my power wanes,

291
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,360
Your Highness,

292
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,960
will you still have a chance to
return to Qian Yuan?

293
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,040
I hear your second brother

294
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,360
is deeply favored by the Qian Yuan
Emperor.

295
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,440
If he takes the throne,

296
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,960
who would care about a hostage prince,

297
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,680
the life or death of an ill‑omened man?

298
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,400
Lord Ming,

299
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,120
why twist the knife in my wound?

300
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,520
This was supposed to be

301
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,080
our grand scheme together.

302
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,800
Here, Your Highness.

303
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,240
It is your turn now.

304
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,880
After these days of fierce battle,

305
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,560
we finally captured Da Yue’s princes.

306
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,600
Now

307
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,480
this river is finally Wu Rong’s.

308
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,240
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

309
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,400
I wonder, Your Majesty,

310
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,320
when will you seek peace with Ling An?

311
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,440
No hurry.

312
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,840
We can wait till things settle.

313
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,760
Young Master Beicheng,

314
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,280
are you feeling homesick?

315
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,600
Look,

316
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,000
Ling An lies in that direction.

317
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,120
Why not bring your family to Wu Rong?

318
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,640
That is indeed an idea.

319
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,920
If you wed Mu Ya,

320
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,680
you will be my brother‑in‑law.

321
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,760
Bring your family from Ling An,

322
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,280
we will live as one happy family.

323
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,600
Please do not jest, Your Majesty.

324
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,680
The princess is of noble rank.

325
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,080
Besides,

326
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,200
I am already married in Ling An.

327
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,000
For a man,

328
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,400
several wives and concubines are normal.

329
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,280
Does Ling An not have

330
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,840
that “co‑wife” custom?

331
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,680
Then I shall decide:

332
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,200
your wife back home

333
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,800
will be your co‑wife.

334
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,400
I will go and see.

335
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,200
Hyah!

336
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,520
Follow him, do not let trouble arise.

337
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,000
Yes.

338
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,480
Hyah!

339
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:14,600
Hyah!

340
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,400
Right now their patrols

341
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,080
are at their weakest.

342
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,960
Use the shift change to drug upstream.

343
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,920
We will then take the chance—

344
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,320
Trying to poison the river?

345
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,560
Keep dreaming.

346
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,800
Who goes there? After them!

347
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,200
Hyah!

348
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:51,440
Hyah!

349
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,040
Hyah!

350
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,160
Hyah!

351
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,080
Hyah!

352
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,560
Stop!

353
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,960
What a fine time this is.

354
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,320
Since the Emperor took the throne,

355
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,600
state affairs have been steady.

356
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,680
Winning all hearts under Heaven

357
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,200
should be within reach soon.

358
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:19,800
Indeed.

359
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,040
The top three exam papers,

360
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,480
I am very pleased with them.

361
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,800
Tomorrow morning,

362
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,320
the results can be posted.

363
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,120
Right?

364
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,520
You must feel much relieved,

365
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:39,800
Lord Rui.

366
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,600
Why do you look so unwell?

367
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,000
There was a case last night.

368
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,840
An examinee was attacked.

369
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,400
How could that be?

370
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,760
I memorialized it overnight.

371
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,320
But His Majesty’s intent

372
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,560
is to suppress the news for now,

373
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,600
and speak once truth is known.

374
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,120
Then you—

375
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,000
Lord Rui—

376
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,480
My lords,

377
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,080
if there is nothing further,

378
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,120
court is dismissed.

379
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,440
We respectfully see Your Majesty off.

380
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,280
Your servant has a matter to report.

381
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,200
Speak.

382
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,960
I impeach Nan Hongyi, Capital Guard Commander,

383
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,160
for dereliction of duty,

384
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,360
causing admitted examinees to be attacked

385
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,760
their lives spared but posts delayed,

386
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,240
leaving offices unfilled

387
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,040
with far‑reaching impact.

388
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,360
The murder of examinees is a grave matter.

389
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,360
These words

390
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,720
do you have proof for them?

391
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,640
On my way to court today,

392
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,480
I met an examinee who stopped my cart
to beg for help.

393
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,920
He said before the results are posted,

394
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,400
the examinees around him in the Spring
Imperial Examination

395
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,200
have been attacked in secret,

396
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,400
either poisoned and bedridden,

397
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,400
or ambushed by thugs on night roads.

398
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,800
So he dares not move about alone.

399
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,640
He went to report this to the Guard
Commander.

400
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,080
The Commander told him to wait
at the post station.

401
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,920
He could not sleep all night,

402
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,000
so at midnight he went out to seek
the Commander.

403
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:55,400
Yet halfway there he was still attacked
by thugs.

404
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,120
He had nowhere else to turn,

405
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,760
and to save his own life,

406
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,440
he could only stop my cart for help.

407
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:03,960
Have a look, sir.

408
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,280
They’re cheap.

409
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,320
My lord, my lord!

410
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,640
Please, save me!

411
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,960
Lately people keep vanishing
from the post station.

412
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,800
Those brought back are all corpses.

413
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,200
Some were poisoned,

414
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,840
some shot through the heart
from behind.

415
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,120
My lord,

416
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,800
I beg you, you must save me.

417
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,400
I beg you, please.

418
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,600
My lord…

419
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,520
I was the one who had it suppressed.

420
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:39,680
In this matter,

421
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,680
until the truth is fully uncovered,

422
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,920
no one may spread the news.

423
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,240
Otherwise the people of the capital

424
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,800
would be thrown into panic.

425
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,120
Your Majesty is wise.

426
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,360
But I believe

427
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,200
Nan Hongyi

428
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,400
has indeed been negligent
in his duties.

429
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,840
The Capital Guard Commander
is so crucial,

430
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,560
it concerns the people’s safety.

431
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,400
Now examinees are attacked
at the capital’s gates.

432
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,920
Future examinees will fear coming
to the capital,

433
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,840
and the common folk will live
in constant fear.

434
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,400
This matter is truly of great gravity.

435
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,200
I beseech Your Majesty

436
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,640
to punish Nan Hongyi
for his negligence.
