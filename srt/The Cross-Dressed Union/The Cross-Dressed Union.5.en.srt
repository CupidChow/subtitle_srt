1
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,080
A woman.

2
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,600
Everyone's tired.

3
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,960
Let's rest early.

4
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,400
I'll take the couch.

5
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:17,760
You...

6
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,000
Why are you here?

7
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,400
Actually, I...

8
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,000
am a man.

9
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,400
So you are, too.

10
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,800
I'll ask Sister-in-law to help you change.

11
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,160
Hot...

12
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,960
I feel...

13
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,560
I'm so hot.

14
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:16,960
I'll have Sister-in-law

15
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,120
help you change your clothes.

16
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:19,960
No, you can't.

17
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,360
They mustn't find out.

18
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,720
No.

19
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,200
Let Sister-in-law know...

20
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,440
No.

21
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,760
No.

22
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,640
Alright.

23
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,360
Now then,

24
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,840
you can finally give up on Rui Yu.

25
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,360
A heart isn't like a jewelry box.

26
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,360
When you like someone,

27
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,960
you open it and look.

28
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,920
When you don't,

29
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,680
you close it and never touch it again.

30
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:50,840
Mother.

31
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,120
Don't worry about me.

32
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,840
You should worry more about Imperial Brother.

33
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,720
By the way,

34
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,160
Your Majesty and Wanwan

35
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,760
grew up together since childhood.

36
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,280
Your Majesty, what do you think

37
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,840
of Wanwan?

38
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,320
Prime Minister Ming's daughter,

39
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,360
beautiful and wise.

40
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,160
She's certainly good.

41
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,040
If she becomes Empress,

42
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,840
I could worry less.

43
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:24,960
Could it be

44
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,400
Your Majesty still minds what happened with Rui Yu?

45
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,560
I wouldn't dare.

46
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,320
What happened to Brother Yu?

47
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,520
What happened back then?

48
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,280
It was Rui Yu's marriage.

49
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,480
For various reasons,

50
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,800
it's not for you to know.

51
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:41,960
Mother.

52
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,480
You didn't let Brother Yu marry me.

53
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,280
That's not it.

54
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,080
But...

55
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,320
You truly can't marry Rui Yu.

56
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,520
Why not?

57
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,760
I always thought Imperial Brother stopped it.

58
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,200
Turns out it was you, Mother.

59
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,040
How could you block your children's happiness?

60
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,040
Still so unreasonable.

61
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,800
I never thought I'd be exposed like this,

62
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,480
letting Nan Chenxiao discover I'm a woman.

63
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,200
No matter what,

64
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,000
I've finally been honest with him.

65
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,360
Lord Rui.

66
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,120
Do you have nothing to say?

67
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,520
I'm sorry.

68
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,760
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

69
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,400
It's just...

70
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,920
I never found the right chance.

71
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,800
I didn't know

72
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,320
how to bring it up.

73
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,040
I never noticed before,

74
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,640
but Rui Yu is so delicate.

75
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,560
Slender shoulders,

76
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,160
a waist you could hold in one hand,

77
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,680
graceful wrists...

78
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:15,800
Chest...

79
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,480
clearly a dainty woman's body.

80
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,160
That makes me look so foolish.

81
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,040
Foolish to the extreme.

82
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,440
You officials are so cunning.

83
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,880
So everyone but Sister-in-law

84
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,320
was lying to me.

85
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,160
Weren't you, too?

86
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,760
Is that the same?

87
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,120
I confessed on my own.

88
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,080
The Rui family

89
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,120
is a distinguished family of officials.

90
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,800
But Father had a rough career.

91
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,000
He never achieved great success.

92
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,760
He could only place his hopes

93
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,840
on his children.

94
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,640
The officialdom is treacherous.

95
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,840
Factions fight fiercely.

96
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,480
This time, I was drugged—

97
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,080
that's the best proof.

98
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,160
To survive in this court's whirlpool,

99
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,960
every step

100
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,400
must be taken with care.

101
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,560
Since I was born,

102
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,680
Father raised me as a boy.

103
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,240
At eight, I entered the palace

104
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,960
as the Crown Prince's companion.

105
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,640
At sixteen, I became an Academician-in-waiting.

106
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,920
Now, with the new ruler,

107
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,080
I've become a Grand Secretary.

108
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,600
I've lamented

109
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,840
the world's unfairness.

110
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,400
My two brothers had no interest in court.

111
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,240
But they had the chance from birth.

112
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,040
No matter how clever I am,

113
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,560
or how many good plans,

114
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,320
I still must give up myself

115
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,400
and struggle to survive.

116
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,760
Greetings, Your Highness.

117
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,720
Rise.

118
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,320
From now on,

119
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,280
you'll be His Highness's companion.

120
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,600
Don't forget Father's advice.

121
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,320
In ancient times, those who wished

122
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,440
to spread virtue across the land

123
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,120
first governed their country.

124
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,720
To govern the country,

125
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,080
one must first order the family.

126
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,520
You've had a hard time.

127
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,080
Rui Yu

128
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,840
Though I cannot, as a woman,

129
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,280
enter private school

130
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,400
or serve in the court,

131
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,600
I can still strive to do better than men.

132
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,600
If one day

133
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,320
I become a good minister for the people,

134
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,160
I will have no regrets.

135
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:47,960
I never thought

136
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,400
she would be so much like me.

137
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,440
Thank you

138
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,200
for saving me in the palace today

139
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,240
and keeping my identity secret.

140
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,600
If you are unwilling,

141
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,400
I can ask Your Majesty

142
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
to let us separate.

143
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,040
No.

144
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,000
I mean,

145
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,640
since we both have secrets,

146
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,360
this arrangement works well.

147
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,240
We can help hide each other's identity.

148
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,560
That's true.

149
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,680
You—

150
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,360
do you have someone you love?

151
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,080
No.

152
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,160
Me neither.

153
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,720
I mean,

154
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,160
that's for the best.

155
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,800
Then rest early.

156
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,440
I'll leave now.

157
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:20,960
Imperial Brother

158
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:21,840
Look at this one.

159
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,720
This one

160
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,320
is about a poor scholar

161
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,520
and a princess's love story.

162
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,400
You,

163
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,080
always read these romance books.

164
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,080
Then this one—

165
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,120
Imperial Brother,

166
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,440
you'll definitely like this one.

167
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,600
It's by my favorite, Wang Guanshan.

168
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,720
Martial arts romance.

169
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,280
Qingyu Shusheng

170
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,840
and the princess's

171
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,840
legendary love story.

172
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,160
Aren't these all scholars' love stories?

173
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,600
What's the difference?

174
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,520
Then let me

175
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,920
tell you another story.

176
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,680
This one—

177
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,360
you've surely never heard it.

178
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,000
Imperial Brother, listen closely.

179
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,240
They

180
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,160
grew up together

181
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,720
as childhood friends.

182
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,160
They understood each other deeply.

183
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,120
Everyone around them

184
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,480
said they were meant to be.

185
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,680
But happiness didn't last.

186
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,600
The girl's father forbade their marriage.

187
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,560
Guess what happened?

188
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,920
He secretly sent his daughter away.

189
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,160
So—

190
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,040
what happened to the girl?

191
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,440
The young man

192
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,800
never stopped searching for her.

193
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,120
He met many remarkable people

194
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,560
and learned many amazing skills.

195
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,120
He finally found the girl.

196
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,400
But sadly,

197
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,200
to avoid being defiled by villains,

198
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,400
the girl took her own life.

199
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,120
The young man

200
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,440
was heartbroken.

201
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,440
For the rest of his life,

202
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,720
he never married again.

203
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,680
Are you sure

204
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,080
this is a love story?

205
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,000
Of course it is!

206
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:06,680
See, a man and a woman—

207
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,760
a man and a woman—

208
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,160
joy, sorrow, love, desire—

209
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:10,840
it's all there!

210
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,920
What else could it be?

211
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,040
Miss Ming,

212
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:14,720
please.

213
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,800
How is this story?

214
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,320
It's not bad.

215
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,440
That's because I told it well.

216
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,280
Your Majesty, I greet you.

217
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,080
Princess.

218
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,000
Wanwan.

219
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,200
Miss Ming,

220
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,920
why aren't you in the Empress Dowager's palace?

221
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,640
What brings you here?

222
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,520
The Empress Dowager said Your Majesty has worked hard lately,

223
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,080
so she sent me to bring some pastries.

224
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,760
Wanwan,

225
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,080
look, Imperial Brother is so stern.

226
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,400
Enough.

227
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,480
That's not what Your Majesty meant.

228
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,120
Come.

229
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,920
I'm sorry.

230
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,760
It's all my fault.

231
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,200
I made Brother Yu fall into the water.

232
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,600
And made Imperial Brother angry.

233
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,400
Imperial Brother was right to ground me.

234
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,040
But it's already

235
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,160
been a whole day.

236
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,080
Isn't it time I go to Rui Manor and apologize?

237
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,000
All thunder, no rain.

238
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,800
That's too fake.

239
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,280
Are you annoyed with me?

240
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,160
Then I'll go.

241
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,520
Go on, then.

242
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,640
Lights fill the city on all sides.

243
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,240
The Milky Way flows through the river's heart.

244
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,800
Have you ever been to the lakeside before?

245
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:00,840
No, I haven't.

246
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,120
Before this,

247
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,480
I always came by carriage,

248
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,240
rushing in and out in a hurry.

249
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,880
Thinking about it now,

250
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,160
I missed so much beautiful scenery.

251
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,720
Don't you feel regret?

252
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,360
Why would I regret it?

253
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,200
For example,

254
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,400
the court struggles are so dangerous,

255
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,960
draining and exhausting.

256
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,760
Or,

257
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,520
losing my freedom.

258
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,440
Just staying inside the house.

259
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,400
Freedom?

260
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,320
At least it's stable.

261
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,320
Most women's lives

262
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,320
are spent moving from one home

263
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,120
to another through marriage,

264
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
wasting their whole lives.

265
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,520
I can do what I want to do,

266
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,600
and contribute to the people's welfare.

267
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,560
So I am truly grateful.

268
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,000
She isn't seeking rank or promotion.

269
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,760
She's a woman with ambition.

270
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,400
I was too narrow-minded.

271
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,960
It's just that sometimes,

272
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,720
when I see these bright young girls,

273
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,760
in my heart,

274
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,560
I can't help but feel a little longing.

275
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,920
If one day

276
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,960
women could serve as officials in court...

277
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,400
But let's talk about you.

278
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,440
Me?

279
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,760
I often see scenery like this.

280
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,200
But

281
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,400
it's always from rooftops

282
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,080
or street corners.

283
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,040
It's bittersweet.

284
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,040
Candied hawthorn!

285
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:25,920
Over here!

286
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,080
You two,

287
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:27,960
would you like a skewer?

288
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,120
We'll take one.

289
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,120
Alright!

290
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:30,960
Here you go, hold it tight.

291
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:31,760
Thank you.

292
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,920
Candied hawthorn.

293
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:36,720
Go ahead, try it.

294
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,480
It's very sweet.

295
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,080
If I could live as a man,

296
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,360
I could serve my country,

297
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,840
and protect peace in my land.

298
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,680
So that's the kind of person he is.

299
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,600
If the Military Imperial Examination succeeds,

300
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,600
he could earn great honor too.

301
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,600
Free from the constraints of being a woman,

302
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,040
away from the chaos of the capital,

303
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,520
and away from the Rui family.

304
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,040
Do you want to go boating on the lake?

305
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,200
Sure!

306
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,760
If you want to,

307
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,680
that boat hasn't lit its lantern yet.

308
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,360
Let's hurry over there.

309
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,640
Let's go.

310
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,560
Rui Yu doesn't get involved in factional strife.

311
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,680
He relies on Your Majesty's favor.

312
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,600
No one

313
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,800
dares to act rashly against him.

314
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,400
But Prince Pan is his maternal cousin.

315
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,200
Why is he pressuring him like this?

316
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,800
The Rui family are all upright officials.

317
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,840
If pushed too far, it will destroy everyone.

318
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,040
Prime Minister Ming,

319
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:06,960
this principle

320
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,480
you should understand better than I do, right?

321
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,600
If the Rui family doesn't know their place,

322
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,600
you know what I

323
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,760
will have to do.

324
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,680
Today I finally shook off the surveillance.

325
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,720
Prime Minister Ming,

326
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,160
surely you didn't just

327
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,840
come here to warn me?

328
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,080
About the matter you asked me to handle,

329
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,480
the ones we caught

330
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,720
were all beggars.

331
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,920
None of them were

332
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,360
the mysterious Blade you mentioned.

333
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,080
Maybe

334
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,800
I was just being paranoid.

335
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,640
But staying alert isn't a bad thing.

336
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,400
Let's expand the search

337
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,120
to cover the whole city.

338
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,000
Prime Minister Ming,

339
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,280
just a small token.

340
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,760
Hope you don't mind.

341
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,520
Prince Pan, you

342
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,200
are really straightforward.

343
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:07,880
I...

344
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,480
That's not what I meant.

345
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,560
Pleasure working with you.

346
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,920
Pleasure working with you.

347
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,280
Come on.

348
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,520
Be careful.

349
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:22,840
I...

350
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,240
I was just trying to get the boat.

351
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,480
Don't take it the wrong way.

352
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,760
I didn't.

353
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,160
You spend all day

354
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,080
either in the study

355
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,320
or at the Hanlin Academy.

356
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,000
Don't you feel bored?

357
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,160
Compared to court disputes,

358
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,960
reading brings peace of mind.

359
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,200
Do you feel

360
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,480
stifled staying at home?

361
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,720
If you ever want to go somewhere,

362
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,640
just tell me.

363
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,040
I'll go with you.

364
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,640
If you want to go anywhere,

365
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,040
I can go with you too.

366
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,480
Let's go, get on the boat.

367
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,320
We've docked.

368
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:25,880
Prime Minister Ming,

369
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,120
Rui Yu,

370
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,040
Madam Rui is here too.

371
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,480
You two have such refined taste.

372
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,440
I won't disturb your outing as a couple.

373
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,520
Please.

374
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,360
Boatman.

375
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,040
Then, Prime Minister Ming,

376
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,280
please make yourself at home.

377
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,480
Let's go, Madam.

378
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:51,760
You two, please.

379
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,080
Take care.

380
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,360
Prince Pan

381
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,680
Seems closely connected to Prime Minister Ming

382
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,440
If Sister-in-law stays here one day

383
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,040
he'll have a reason to visit

384
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,280
If this keeps up

385
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,280
it could threaten Nan Chenxiao

386
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,400
Something on your mind?

387
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,680
No

388
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,520
I was just thinking

389
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,120
Let's move out and live on our own

390
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,440
Why do we need to move out?

391
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:48,920
We

392
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,680
are married now, after all

393
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,440
Living separately

394
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,080
would be more convenient

395
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,720
Alright

396
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,840
Master

397
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,600
If there's a suitable place

398
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,160
Moving out

399
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,640
isn't that easy

400
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,040
The house

401
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,240
needs to be set up anew

402
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:35,960
Right

403
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:36,880
Exactly

404
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,560
This new residence, right?

405
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,280
The furniture

406
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,080
and the decor all need to be redone

407
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:41,920
Let me tell you

408
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,800
There's a lot going on behind the scenes

409
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,240
Your elder brother does this for a living

410
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,960
And besides

411
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:47,720
Well

412
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,640
Second Brother just returned

413
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,960
and you're moving out already

414
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,360
How will Second Brother feel?

415
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,080
I think Rui Yu moving out

416
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,000
is a good idea

417
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,720
Yes, go ahead and move

418
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,720
Why did you hit me?

419
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:01,840
Did I say something wrong?

420
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:05,880
Hopeless fool

421
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,360
It's really hard work

422
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:04,840
Liang

423
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,920
It's you

424
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,320
Take a break

425
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,640
I'm not tired

426
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,280
You came at just the right time

427
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,720
Take a look at this

428
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,840
Where's the bedroom?

429
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,320
Right here

430
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,920
It's on the south side of the main hall

431
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,040
It's a great location

432
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,640
Are we sharing a room?

433
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,120
Th-this is your room

434
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,400
I

435
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,320
I'll stay

436
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,160
in another courtyard

437
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,520
I'm just joking with you

438
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,360
In a few months

439
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,720
it'll be the Spring Imperial Examination

440
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,800
The list of those who passed the local exam

441
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,400
should be arriving soon

442
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,040
Then

443
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,240
what about the Military Imperial Examination?

444
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,200
I've been working on it

445
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,720
But the conflict between civil and military

446
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,600
can't be resolved overnight

447
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,320
In the court

448
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,040
many officials still oppose it

449
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,680
So

450
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,360
it's an expected outcome

451
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,080
Trust me

452
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,600
I'll make it happen

453
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:40,800
I trust you

454
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,480
Then take a look at this

455
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,280
This training ground

456
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,800
Should it be bigger?

457
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,080
It's big enough already

458
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,080
No need to make it bigger

459
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,560
This is the library

460
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,560
and also my study

461
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,120
It's close to your room

462
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,040
Quick

463
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:03,520
Move it up

464
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,440
Little Dazi

465
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,200
Miss Qiuhong

466
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,120
Are these gifts for the Rui family?

467
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:12,600
Yes

468
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,800
The princess wants to send some things too

469
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,160
Please deliver them all together

470
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,720
That might be a bit...

471
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,880
It's fine, it's fine

472
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,120
Move that box up as well

473
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:25,520
Go ahead and move it

474
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,320
Yes, yes

475
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,440
Be careful

476
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,800
Did you hear? Be careful

477
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,200
Handle with care

478
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,520
Set it down gently

479
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:34,880
Let's go

480
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,320
Greetings, Sir

481
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,920
Greetings, Madam

482
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,400
Go inside and have a look

483
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,320
From now on, all household matters

484
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,320
will be managed by Madam

485
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,480
Everyone, please support her

486
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,800
Thank you for your efforts

487
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,600
Yes, yes

488
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,800
I'll show you the training ground

489
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,520
Alright

490
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:17,640
How is it?

491
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,280
It's great

492
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,360
Try it out, see if it suits you

493
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:05,920
Come on, come on

494
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,240
Move it forward

495
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,600
Watch out

496
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,080
Slow down

497
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,520
Even moving in, there are guards

498
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,600
Being an official is nice

499
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,840
This way, this way, this way

500
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,040
Be careful

501
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,640
Alright

502
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:19,960
Slow down, slow down

503
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,560
Put it here

504
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,240
Don't rush, be careful

505
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,320
Handle it gently

506
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,800
Thank you for your hard work

507
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,240
Thank you, everyone

508
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,280
Go to the front hall for some fruit and tea

509
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,280
Thank you, Madam

510
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,160
This way, please

511
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,000
Let's go

512
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:35,960
Please

513
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,120
Thank you for your hard work

514
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,280
Where is Brother Yu, anyway?

515
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:45,880
Princess

516
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,640
Are you alright?

517
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,880
Miss

518
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:14,880
What are you doing?

519
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,480
Helping you recover your spirit

520
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:17,840
No need to thank me

521
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,600
What are you writing?

522
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:27,920
It's confidential

523
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,520
Speaking of which

524
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,240
Which palace are you a maid from?

525
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,680
I am Princess Chunxi.

526
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,560
A palace maid.

527
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,920
The princess sent me to the residence.

528
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,320
To deliver a message to Master Rui.

529
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,440
Can you take me to see him?

530
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,520
He has moved out.

531
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,680
When did he move out?

532
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,600
Just this morning.

533
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,080
If you had come an hour earlier,

534
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,120
maybe

535
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,840
you could have caught him.

536
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,320
Well,

537
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,040
where did he move to?

538
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,800
Do you need something from him?

539
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:04,960
Alright.

540
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:05,960
I'll take you.

541
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,280
Really?

542
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:07,920
Really.

543
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,000
By the way,

544
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,880
I still don't know who you are.
