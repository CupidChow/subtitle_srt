1
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,480
So you're saying...

2
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,800
They were all sent by my second brother.

3
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,720
I dare not speak carelessly.

4
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,560
Fine.

5
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,800
What a wonderful second brother I have.

6
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,480
Here I am, far from home.

7
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,720
He sent people to ambush my residence.

8
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,160
Waiting for a chance to assassinate me.

9
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,320
He wants to use my death

10
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,880
as an excuse to attack Ling An.

11
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,880
What are the casualties?

12
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,200
Thirty percent of my people died.

13
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,040
Ten percent were wounded.

14
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,480
Go fetch the memorial.

15
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,320
Yes.

16
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,480
What's wrong?

17
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,640
Is your back hurting?

18
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,640
It's nothing.

19
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,680
My back is just fine.

20
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,680
You should still be careful.

21
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,440
How about we switch next time?

22
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,440
No, no, that's not necessary.

23
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,200
We're fine as we are.

24
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,800
Are you really okay?

25
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,080
Really, I'm fine.

26
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,440
Darn it.

27
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:20,640
Here.

28
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,280
Try this.

29
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,000
I loved this when I was little.

30
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,280
Master.

31
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,920
No talking while eating.

32
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,280
Right.

33
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,160
No talking while eating.

34
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,080
Father.

35
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,720
Are your eyes bothering you?

36
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,240
Should I get a doctor to check them?

37
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,720
I'm fine.

38
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,920
No talking at the table.

39
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,560
You have no manners at all.

40
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,280
Rui Yu.

41
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,640
Go to the office later.

42
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,040
Go with your father.

43
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,680
So you can look out for each other.

44
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,920
I'm heading to the barracks, not the same way.

45
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,640
Master.

46
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,520
I mean,

47
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,960
in a bit,

48
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,720
see the good son-in-law off.

49
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,320
No need to trouble Father-in-law.

50
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,720
It's fine.

51
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,480
Father's got nothing else to do anyway.

52
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,240
Eat a bit more.

53
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,200
Greetings, Your Majesty.

54
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,320
No need for formalities.

55
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,640
I heard

56
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,720
there was a fire at the Residence of the Hostage Prince last night.

57
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,240
Prince Pan.

58
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,280
Was everything alright?

59
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,680
Now that I am in a foreign land,

60
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,920
I can't control my own fate.

61
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,760
But I am grateful for Your Majesty's kindness.

62
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,200
Prince Pan, you flatter me.

63
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,200
Having you stay in Ling An

64
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,560
is to strengthen ties between our nations.

65
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,240
But my second royal brother

66
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,000
doesn't seem to think so.

67
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,240
If I die in Ling An,

68
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,560
my second royal brother

69
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,480
will act without restraint.

70
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,080
But as far as I know,

71
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,960
the Second Prince always advocated

72
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,440
for friendly relations with Ling An.

73
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,000
Then Your Majesty must know

74
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,040
I,

75
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,960
am but a discarded pawn of the Qian Yuan Royal Family.

76
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,800
Even so,

77
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,240
I still carry the blood of the Qian Yuan Royal Family.

78
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,720
If my second royal brother sends troops recklessly,

79
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,720
he'll be condemned for harming his own kin.

80
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,760
But if I die in Ling An,

81
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,000
then by reason and emotion,

82
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,960
my second royal brother will seek justice for me.

83
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,560
My eldest royal brother has always been gentle.

84
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,720
He can't match cunning and schemes.

85
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,720
My second royal brother excels at both.

86
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,560
So,

87
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,040
Prince Pan, you mean

88
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,160
the Second Prince wants to use your death

89
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,080
to declare war on Ling An?

90
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,160
Exactly.

91
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,400
What you said

92
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,520
I do not doubt.

93
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,680
But what does this have to do with me?

94
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,760
Ling An

95
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,080
is prosperous and strong.

96
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,280
What is there to fear?

97
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,240
I know

98
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,720
my life means little to Ling An

99
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,000
or to Qian Yuan.

100
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,280
But I,

101
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,720
do not wish to die in a foreign land.

102
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,440
I am willing to be Your Majesty's

103
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,240
leverage against Qian Yuan.

104
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,960
In exchange for Your Majesty's protection.

105
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,480
Let me live as a retired prince in Ling An.

106
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,240
And spend the rest of my days here.

107
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,240
Rise.

108
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,320
Qian Yuan envoys will soon arrive in the capital.

109
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,280
Your residence's guards

110
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:45,880
I

111
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,960
will replace them.

112
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,240
Thank you, Your Majesty.

113
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,440
Then,

114
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,640
I won't trouble you further.

115
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,040
I'll take my leave.

116
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,080
You may go.

117
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:02,760
Father.

118
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,280
The barracks and the Hanlin Academy aren't in the same direction.

119
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,480
You don't need to see me off.

120
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,440
Since I've promised Madam,

121
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,640
A gentleman's word

122
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,960
cannot be taken back.

123
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,520
Don't worry, Father.

124
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,200
I won't tell Mother.

125
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm not...

126
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,040
Forget it.

127
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,560
Do as you wish.

128
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,880
Your son-in-law takes his leave.

129
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,360
Rui Yu.

130
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,360
Our Nan Chenxiao,

131
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,880
has he ever

132
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,160
done anything wrong?

133
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,680
No.

134
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,400
Really, nothing.

135
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,560
Think carefully.

136
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,200
My own daughter,

137
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,280
I know her well.

138
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,240
If it really doesn't work out...

139
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,280
Please, your family mustn't...

140
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,160
Don't worry, Father.

141
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,000
Everything's just fine.

142
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,240
You, you...

143
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,400
You...

144
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,400
I...

145
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:56,880
Father.

146
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,280
What are you trying to say?

147
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,200
It's nothing, it's nothing.

148
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,760
Go on.

149
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:04,960
Then I'll be going.

150
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,840
How is it?

151
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,200
The brushwork is powerful.

152
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,480
It has a grand presence.

153
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,960
I suppose Prince Pan found a famous artist.

154
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,760
This is Your Majesty of Ling An's own work.

155
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,120
It was delivered with the guards outside.

156
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,040
Your Majesty of Ling An

157
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,240
Why send Prince Pan a Ling An landscape?

158
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,400
To intimidate.

159
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,840
All of Second Royal Brother's men are exposed.

160
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,480
Yes.

161
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,480
I had people investigate several times.

162
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,320
The previous hidden spies are gone.

163
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,600
That's good.

164
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,400
The birds in the woods

165
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,960
have all come out.

166
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,680
But there are more guards outside now.

167
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,120
Isn't that a good thing?

168
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,400
Everything is out in the open.

169
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,360
Saves me

170
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,240
from all the trouble.

171
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,440
Heaven covers me.

172
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,120
Earth bears me.

173
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,520
Heaven and earth give me life.

174
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,120
With or without intent.

175
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,720
Otherwise, I would starve.

176
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,240
Ascend to the heavenly path.

177
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,800
Or ring the jade bell.

178
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,080
Roam the imperial capital.

179
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,840
This pool of clear spring water

180
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,240
has stirred up the mud after all.

181
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,360
Now it's all murky.

182
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,280
Your Majesty, I greet you.

183
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,400
No need for formalities.

184
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,520
By order of my king,

185
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,840
I bring several treasures.

186
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,240
To wish Your Majesty a happy new year.

187
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,120
The King of Qian Yuan is thoughtful.

188
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,400
When I left Qian Yuan,

189
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,440
I heard Ling An's border suffered

190
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,840
provocation and harassment from nomads.

191
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,560
Winter on the grasslands

192
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,840
is always hard.

193
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,800
These people are truly arrogant.

194
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,840
But they have no fixed home.

195
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,560
It's really hard to wipe them out.

196
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,120
From what I hear,

197
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,160
the grasslands are right at our border.

198
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,120
I suppose

199
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,160
Qian Yuan

200
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,440
isn't peaceful either.

201
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,960
I wish to form a new alliance with Your Majesty.

202
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,120
Qian Yuan can send troops with Ling An

203
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,240
to clear out the nomads' harassment.

204
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,120
Sounds like a permanent solution.

205
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,640
This time,

206
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,400
I have another matter.

207
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,520
It is for

208
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,640
the Second Royal Brother

209
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,240
to propose marriage to Princess Yan Luo.

210
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,440
A marriage proposal.

211
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,360
Alright, alright.

212
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:05,920
Look,

213
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,000
Sir Rui,

214
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,120
you're really impressive.

215
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,680
You've almost solved all the lantern riddles here.

216
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,440
I can't help guessing when I see a fun riddle.

217
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,200
Two, right?

218
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:16,680
Liang Jin

219
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,120
Do you want some candied hawthorn?

220
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,120
May I, sir?

221
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,680
Of course.

222
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,800
Candied hawthorn.

223
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,360
Four sticks, please.

224
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,560
Young master,

225
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,880
I can't hold any more.

226
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,240
Then

227
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
let's just have one stick.

228
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,360
Then three sticks will do.

229
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,120
Here you go.

230
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,200
Thank you.

231
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,120
Want to see the lanterns?

232
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,680
Candied hawthorn.

233
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,360
Let's go.

234
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,120
Come.

235
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,600
Sir.

236
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,480
Where's sir?

237
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,120
Miss must think we're in the way.

238
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,240
She took sir away.

239
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,040
Then

240
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,800
Should we go after them?

241
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,120
No need to chase.

242
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,120
Let's just wait somewhere.

243
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,320
This one's pretty, that one's pretty too.

244
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,560
There are so many lanterns today.

245
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,240
Yes.

246
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,480
The lanterns aren't as pretty as you.

247
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,000
Really.

248
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,200
Sir Meng,

249
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:01,920
No need for formalities.

250
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,240
Please sit.

251
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,240
I wonder how long Sir Meng will stay in Ling An.

252
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,920
How long do you plan to stay?

253
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,680
The king sent me to discuss the marriage alliance.

254
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,000
And to visit Prince Pan.

255
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,760
Father,

256
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,440
do you still remember me?

257
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,680
Not just the king,

258
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,920
the Second Royal Brother misses you too.

259
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,920
He asked me

260
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,480
to bring you this.

261
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,560
This...

262
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,920
This is my mother's keepsake.

263
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,800
The princess found

264
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,440
Concubine's belongings not yet buried.

265
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,760
She wanted to send them to the grave.

266
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,000
But the Second Royal Brother was kind

267
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,000
and wanted Prince Pan

268
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,440
to keep a memento.

269
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,800
Then please

270
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,440
thank the Second Royal Brother for me,

271
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,320
Sir Meng.

272
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,920
The Second Royal Brother said

273
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,560
"thanks"

274
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,000
is too light.

275
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,680
He hopes Prince Pan knows his purpose in Ling An.

276
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,480
Don't do anything against Qian Yuan.

277
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,120
I understand.

278
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,920
Prince Pan has been in Ling An for a long time.

279
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,000
You must be well established now.

280
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,160
This is a good chance

281
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,800
to show loyalty to the king.

282
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,920
So, Sir Meng, what do you think

283
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,680
I should do?

284
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,040
Ling An is as calm as a lake now.

285
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,800
The king wants you to be a stone

286
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,160
or a drop of ink

287
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,320
to stir up the lake as much as possible.

288
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,920
Make it as chaotic as you can.

289
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,560
It's getting late.

290
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,320
I should return to the post station.

291
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,080
So Your Majesty of Ling An won't get suspicious.

292
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,640
Take care, Sir Meng.

293
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,520
They threatened me.

294
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,320
They killed my mother, the concubine.

295
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,920
They wish I'd die far from home.

296
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,160
Now they want me to serve Qian Yuan.

297
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,560
He's just dreaming.

298
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,680
Please, Prince Pan, calm your anger.

299
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,840
Take care of yourself to avenge Concubine.

300
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,840
Over in Pingxiang—

301
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,520
Any news from there?

302
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,800
The late king's family holds military power.

303
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,840
Pingxiang has always valued martial strength.

304
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,200
Hou Qi can't find an opening for now.

305
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,400
The people sent to Hou Qi to train assassins—

306
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,960
What did they say?

307
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,560
Still short on money.

308
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,280
Money.

309
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,720
I worked hard to get them money.

310
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,320
Can't even handle a thirteen-year-old.

311
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,640
Tell him—

312
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,320
If he wants power, he must rely on himself.

313
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,800
Otherwise, his nephew will soon—

314
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,800
take that position.

315
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,520
Yes.

316
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,920
I'll handle it right away.

317
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:24,920
Your Majesty—

318
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,080
What happened?

319
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,680
The Empress Dowager fainted

320
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,680
suddenly while meditating.

321
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,720
Has the imperial doctor seen her?

322
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,000
He said it's from excessive worry.

323
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,960
She can't eat or sleep well.

324
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,840
No serious harm for now.

325
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,480
What about the Qian Yuan envoy?

326
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,440
He went to the Residence of the Hostage Prince.

327
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,320
Met with Prince Pan.

328
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,320
Left about an hour later.

329
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,480
Understood.

330
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,200
Madam.

331
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,360
Please cover your eyes.

332
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,440
I came at Second Young Master Rui's request.

333
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,240
Is this caution still necessary?

334
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,720
It's the rule.

335
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,240
Please forgive us, Madam.

336
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,360
The moment the door opens,

337
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,320
the air rushes downward.

338
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,720
This is underground.

339
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,960
Please wait here for a moment.

340
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,200
What is this?

341
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,560
So mysterious.

342
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:46,920
Second Brother.

343
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,440
Second Brother.

344
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,800
Why are you here?

345
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,200
Your Majesty, I greet you.

346
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,360
No need for formalities.

347
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,840
It's quiet here.

348
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,960
All the city's secrets gather here.

349
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,080
It's truly a hidden paradise.

350
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,320
What do you think?

351
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,600
Madam Rui—

352
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,480
No—

353
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,960
Should be called—

354
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,960
Second Young Master Nan.

355
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,080
How do you find this Hidden Pavilion?

356
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:20,840
What do you think?

357
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,600
How does he know who I am?

358
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,120
If I seize him here,

359
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,600
saving my parents is still unlikely.

360
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,960
If I take my own life—

361
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,680
Seizing His Majesty won't save the Nan family.

362
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,480
Nor will suicide.

363
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,920
Is Your Majesty here to accuse me?

364
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,200
I'm here to offer you a choice.

365
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,560
A choice?

366
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,680
To protect yourself and stay safe,

367
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,200
living in fear at the Rui residence forever,

368
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,360
or to fight alongside me—

369
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,200
become Nan Chenxiao again,

370
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,960
and achieve greatness.

371
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,000
Of course I want to achieve greatness.

372
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,000
But how did Your Majesty know I'm not a woman?

373
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,480
Do you remember—

374
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,200
the day your elder brother was buried?

375
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,360
What happened then?

376
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,480
Why are you crying?

377
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,720
Who are you?

378
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,440
Are you a boy or a girl?

379
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,720
My mother said—

380
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,480
I'm a girl.

381
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,880
I see.

382
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,000
You knew from then?

383
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,120
Why didn't you tell the late emperor?

384
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:57,880
Sit.

385
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:07,960
Because I—

386
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,120
want to see civil and military peace.

387
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,440
Let generals regain their place.

388
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,480
Ling An—

389
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,160
may flourish for another hundred years.

390
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,800
Are you willing—

391
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,160
to be my right-hand?

392
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,160
Serve Ling An's future?

393
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,760
I, Nan Chenxiao,

394
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,720
will vanquish all enemies.

395
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,440
Defend Ling An's land.

396
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,480
Very good.

397
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,520
However—

398
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,520
Before things are settled,

399
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,280
you must keep a low profile.

400
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,800
I give you this token.

401
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,640
You may command the Chongming Guard.

402
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:53,960
I—

403
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,440
will not fail this mission.

404
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,160
Enough, rise.

405
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,120
I came today after Second Brother's letter.

406
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,880
That's why I came to the Hidden Pavilion.

407
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,000
Your Majesty and Second Brother—

408
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,400
Come out.

409
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,000
Your Majesty, I greet you.

410
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,040
Rui Wang has served me in secret.

411
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,200
Now I give you the secret post.

412
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,480
Rui Wang will handle intelligence.

413
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,480
And in the court—

414
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,560
Rui Yu will oversee the officials.

415
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,560
With this arrangement,

416
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,040
you will work perfectly together.

417
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:33,680
I—

418
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,440
can rest easy.

419
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,680
Second Brother, oh Second Brother—

420
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,160
You've hidden yourself well.

421
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,440
Does Rui Yu know about this?

422
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,760
His Majesty told me to keep it secret.

423
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,560
But Yu'er is clever—

424
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,880
he found out first.

425
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,240
Then I had no choice.

426
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,480
Enough.

427
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,240
Let's end the reminiscing here.

428
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,360
I have a task for you.

429
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,240
The Second Prince of Qian Yuan

430
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,520
wants to marry Princess Yan Luo.

431
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,040
I have decided—

432
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,280
to let Yan Luo

433
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,480
leave Ling An.

434
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,720
pretend—

435
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,360
Princess on the run

436
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,920
This is a clever idea

437
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,120
Ling An is powerful now

438
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,680
The princess is missing

439
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,040
Qian Yuan can't do anything

440
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,040
But it sounds

441
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,120
a bit shameless

442
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,040
Playing tricks on honest folks

443
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,360
always works

444
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,520
I have heard

445
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,000
the Pavilion Master is close to Princess Yan Luo lately

446
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,320
Aren't you planning

447
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,000
to help with this?

448
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,680
Your Majesty, please don't joke

449
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,320
I'm just a commoner

450
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,960
Only because of Rui Yu

451
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,400
have I met the princess a few times

452
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,320
Enough

453
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,960
I won't beat around the bush

454
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,680
Command of the Chongming Guard is given to Nan Chenxiao

455
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,000
to protect the princess

456
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,320
And you

457
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,440
will follow my orders

458
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,720
and travel between the five nations

459
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,240
You know the local customs best

460
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,480
With you along

461
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,920
I can rest assured

462
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:00,920
Well

463
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,680
It's settled then

464
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,520
The luggage is ready in the palace

465
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,560
The travel documents will be sent to Rui Yu

466
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,000
Tonight

467
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,760
you will set out on your journey

468
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,000
Rui Yu is going too

469
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,520
Among you all

470
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,280
only Rui Yu is an official

471
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,800
When you reach Pingxiang

472
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,040
if negotiations are needed

473
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,520
she's the only one who can represent you

474
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,480
Though you have command of the Chongming Guard

475
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,760
when you're out there

476
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,400
you must still listen to Rui Yu

477
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,240
Of course

478
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,560
Respectfully seeing Your Majesty off

479
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,720
Now

480
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,040
we should call you Young Master Nan

481
00:24:59,280 --> 00:24:59,800
Second Brother

482
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,480
I have something to ask

483
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:03,840
What is it?

484
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,320
Does Your Majesty know Rui Yu is actually...

485
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,320
He knows

486
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,080
I have met Your Majesty

487
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,440
No need for formalities

488
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,480
Take a seat

489
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,040
Thank you, Your Majesty

490
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,160
Yesterday, I attended the lantern festival

491
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,000
It was truly lively

492
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,600
The Second Prince has always liked Ling An's customs

493
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,960
He hopes to visit the capital

494
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:45,960
As the old saying goes

495
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,440
A visitor is a guest

496
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,080
If the Second Prince truly has leisure

497
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,880
Next spring

498
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,200
is a good time

499
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,840
Even in Qian Yuan, I've heard of the capital

500
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,240
its splendid prosperity

501
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,760
And Princess Chunxi

502
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,880
is gentle and wise

503
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,160
with stunning beauty

504
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,440
If I could marry the princess

505
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,240
wouldn't that be

506
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:06,920
Your Majesty

507
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,200
Your Majesty

508
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,440
The princess is missing

509
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,200
What?

510
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,440
Yan Luo is missing

511
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,360
How could the princess go missing in the palace?

512
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,920
Except for the Empress Dowager's quarters

513
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,120
everywhere has been searched

514
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,840
Send some people to search the Empress Dowager's palace

515
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:25,880
Remember

516
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,760
Do not disturb her meditation

517
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,440
Yes

518
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,880
I'll go right away

519
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,600
Your Majesty

520
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,320
Her Highness left the palace by carriage

521
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,800
and disappeared

522
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,320
Well

523
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,560
How could you be so careless?

524
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,400
Forgive us, Your Majesty

525
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,320
Send people outside the palace to search

526
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,040
Hurry, go!

527
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:44,600
Yes, yes

528
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,800
My little sister

529
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,560
has always been stubborn

530
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,800
Maybe she heard some rumors

531
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,160
and thought she was to marry into Qian Yuan, so she ran

532
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,200
But I must return to Qian Yuan in less than ten days

533
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,560
That's unfortunate

534
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,400
If I remember correctly

535
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,320
the envoy should exchange documents at the Four Directions Hall today

536
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,040
I won't keep you

537
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:08,520
Li Quan

538
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,040
Here

539
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,280
Escort Sir Meng to the Four Directions Hall

540
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:11,960
Yes

541
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,920
I take my leave

542
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,080
Please

543
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,480
The act went a bit too far

544
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,080
I wonder how that girl is doing

545
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,760
After passing this wild forest

546
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,040
there are still dozens of miles to go

547
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,240
My heart flows away like water

548
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,200
Mountains and clouds are pure

549
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,440
But

550
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,200
Why does it feel hotter the further south we go?

551
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,360
It's getting warmer

552
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,000
Yes

553
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,280
The sun feels nice now

554
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,280
You dragged me out of the city last night

555
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,040
I'm still confused

556
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,240
It feels like I'm dreaming

557
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,760
Besides not having to worry anymore

558
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,240
I can finally show my talents

559
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,120
And I learned Second Brother

560
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,800
isn't just lazy

561
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,600
All those things before

562
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,120
were just an act

563
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,560
I never pretend

564
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,240
You

565
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,240
hid your identity as Pavilion Master

566
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,320
and work for Your Majesty

567
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,520
Isn't that just a disguise?

568
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,200
Who says the Pavilion Master

569
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,520
can't be lazy?

570
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,560
Getting things done while relaxing

571
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,000
That's real skill

572
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:30,840
Let me tell you something.

573
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,480
Yesterday, I went to the Hidden Pavilion.

574
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,480
I met with Your Majesty.

575
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,440
It honestly scared me to death.

576
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,040
I couldn't keep calm.

577
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,320
I've never faced something so grand.

578
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,760
I still need Sir Rui to teach me well.

579
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,600
What could I possibly teach you?

580
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,400
I was just thinking

581
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,440
how to explain to the Hanlin Academy

582
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,280
about my sudden trip away.

583
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,040
Don't worry.

584
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,880
I've already asked for leave for you at the Hanlin Academy.

585
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,840
Being away for over a month won't be a problem.

586
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,680
What reason allows for such a long leave?

587
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,040
It wasn't my idea.

588
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,040
It was Second Brother.

589
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,680
He said I should help you gather herbs.

590
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,880
To help you recover your health.

591
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,680
He said

592
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,640
it's for the family's lineage.

593
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:15,880
Slow down.

594
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,360
Rui Wang.

595
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:20,520
You...

596
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,600
You two are a proper married couple.

597
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,600
That reason isn't too much.

598
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,600
Why have you been scratching since earlier?

599
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,440
Are you uncomfortable?

600
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,840
It's nothing, just...

601
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,080
Let me take a look.

602
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:40,920
It should be fine.

603
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,360
Just a mosquito bite.

604
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,280
Liang Jin.

605
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,480
Go get the ointment.

606
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,680
Yes, Sir.

607
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:51,920
Here you go, Sir.

608
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,280
Don't move.

609
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,440
That should be fine now.

610
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,840
I-I'll let Second Brother help apply it.

611
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,520
It's not proper for me to do it, right?

612
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,920
After all, you now...

613
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,440
What's improper about it?

614
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,920
Everyone here was sent by Your Majesty.

615
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,760
What are you afraid of?

616
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,120
Just help me apply it.

617
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:17,880
Alright, alright.

618
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,280
Hurry, hurry.

619
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,360
Madam, she is...

620
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,920
Sir, you are...

621
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,880
Come help me quickly.

622
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,600
Just this spot.

623
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,080
This...
