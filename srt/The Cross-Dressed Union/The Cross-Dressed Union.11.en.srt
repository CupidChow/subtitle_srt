1
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,080
Young Master Lin

2
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,200
Young Master Lin

3
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:43,680
Come.

4
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:44,840
Slow down.

5
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:49,960
Come.

6
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,480
How is it?

7
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,160
Come.

8
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,320
Young Master Lin

9
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,480
Young Master Lin, Young Master Lin.

10
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,720
Ling An Hanlin Grand Scholar Rui Yu

11
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,920
By order of Our Majesty

12
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,240
I am visiting Pingxiang

13
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,840
to pay respects to the Prince of Pingxiang.

14
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,080
It's been a long time.

15
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,920
Lord Rui, you are as distinguished as ever.

16
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,040
Foreign envoys must be received by officials.

17
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,200
A memorial has been submitted.

18
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,720
I will determine the purpose of your visit.

19
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,400
Then arrange a meeting accordingly.

20
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,200
His Highness summoned you to the hall

21
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,640
to discuss state affairs.

22
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,800
Why summon a foreign envoy at this time?

23
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,960
Could it be

24
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,400
Lord Rui wishes to defect to Pingxiang?

25
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,000
If not,

26
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
why not bow before the Prince?

27
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,760
When an envoy visits,

28
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,000
the one to meet

29
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,960
is naturally your country's ruler.

30
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,320
I've already submitted a memorial to the palace.

31
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,480
But Your Highness keeps obstructing me.

32
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,760
Are you

33
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,960
trying to exceed your authority?

34
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:48,760
Regent

35
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,600
Aren't you looking to change the grain trade

36
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,640
ratio between Pingxiang and Ling Qian?

37
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,240
Lord Rui is right here now.

38
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,520
You can discuss it with him.

39
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,400
No need to send envoys all the way to Ling An.

40
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,200
Lord Rui, you're too late.

41
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,080
I've already settled it with Qian Yuan.

42
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,800
We'll buy twenty percent of our grain from Qian Yuan.

43
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,000
This matter

44
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,080
has nothing to discuss with Ling An.

45
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,040
I don't wish to discuss it

46
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,520
with Your Highness either.

47
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,720
Since I arrived in Pingxiang,

48
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,680
I've noticed

49
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,520
Pingxiang is rich in fruit,

50
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,960
with many varieties.

51
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,720
Plus, Pingxiang is famed for Huanghuali.

52
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,720
With such abundant resources,

53
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,480
it should be even more prosperous.

54
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,720
But why

55
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,080
when there's no curfew,

56
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,080
are the streets

57
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,480
still so empty?

58
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,760
It's far less lively than Ling An.

59
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,840
Lord Rui, what do you mean by this?

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,960
Are you mocking Pingxiang's poverty?

61
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,760
I mean no offense.

62
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,240
But your words

63
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,560
point out the real issue.

64
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,800
Pingxiang has little farmland.

65
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,160
Its grain output

66
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,240
can't feed all its people.

67
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,560
It must import grain every year.

68
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,840
This drains the national treasury.

69
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,680
As a result,

70
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,440
developing other industries

71
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,840
and enriching people's lives

72
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,480
becomes even harder.

73
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,680
It's a tough challenge.

74
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,920
Lord Rui has only stayed here a few days.

75
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,800
How do you know

76
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,080
about our empty treasury?

77
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,760
Such confidential matters?

78
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,240
May I ask, sir,

79
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,440
what is your position?

80
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,840
I am the Vice Minister of Revenue.

81
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,520
You know better than I

82
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,920
if the treasury is empty.

83
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,720
I won't teach a fish how to swim.

84
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,920
I just want to say one thing.

85
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,800
I'm here to bring Pingxiang

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,280
silver.

87
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,760
Why is Lord Rui so generous?

88
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,920
Giving us money for nothing?

89
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,720
Sending silver to Pingxiang?

90
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,040
Is it to use mutual trade to control us?

91
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,800
Now that the Prince has ascended,

92
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,240
he expands farming and cares for the people.

93
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,800
Soon, we won't need your help.

94
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,720
Lord Rui speaks only of money.

95
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,160
Isn't that beneath a scholar's integrity?

96
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,840
Today, I am here

97
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,480
not to discuss

98
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,520
poetry or prose.

99
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,520
Whether a scholar's integrity

100
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,480
conflicts with wealth,

101
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,240
let's set that aside.

102
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,040
Today,

103
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,800
I wish to speak with the Prince of Pingxiang

104
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,520
about terms.

105
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,640
What terms do you wish to discuss?

106
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,920
Renew the alliance treaty,

107
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,040
build a trade route,

108
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,320
and open mutual trade.

109
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,680
After that,

110
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,160
Ling An will annually

111
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,680
buy at thirty percent of Pingxiang's price

112
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,320
fruit and Huanghuali.

113
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,520
This way,

114
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,040
Pingxiang's surplus is solved,

115
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,320
and Pingxiang gains silver

116
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,920
three million taels a year.

117
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,440
Only three million taels?

118
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,240
Lord Rui dares to offer so little?

119
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,960
Fruit sales profit,

120
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,840
Pingxiang

121
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,320
gets thirty percent.

122
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,560
Huanghuali

123
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,760
crafted by our skilled artisans,

124
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,400
after labor costs

125
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,680
and other expenses,

126
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,400
Pingxiang gets forty percent profit.

127
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,480
Ling An shows its grandeur.

128
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,000
Pingxiang each year

129
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,240
can earn at least

130
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,720
forty million taels of silver.

131
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,520
Lord Rui,

132
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,760
don't just talk about benefits.

133
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,480
What are your terms?

134
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,000
Once the trade route is built,

135
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,280
Ling An

136
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,760
will station envoys

137
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,720
to manage merchants at each checkpoint.

138
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,080
Additionally,

139
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,240
besides local grain,

140
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,760
forty percent yearly

141
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,480
must be bought from Ling An.

142
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,920
A ten-year contract.

143
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,160
Wishful thinking!

144
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,000
Letting Ling An control the trade route—

145
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,480
in the end,

146
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,240
it's just a way to control us with grain.

147
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,200
I just said

148
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,560
I didn't want to discuss this.

149
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,040
I didn't say I wouldn't.

150
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,560
Everything

151
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,480
is up to the Prince of Pingxiang.

152
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,480
I believe Pingxiang

153
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,760
should be ruled by its Prince.

154
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,800
Our nation will offer

155
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,640
forty million taels of silver yearly

156
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,280
to open mutual trade with Pingxiang.

157
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,720
It's a gift for the Prince's succession.

158
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,800
No one else is involved.

159
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,480
Thank you, Your Majesty of Ling An.

160
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,680
Your Highness,

161
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,760
mutual trade is a good thing.

162
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,960
But control of the trade route

163
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,000
must not be given up.

164
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,080
Otherwise, if war breaks out,

165
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,320
won't Ling An lead us by the nose again?

166
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,960
Duke Fushan, rest assured.

167
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,000
Our Majesty is benevolent at heart.

168
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,560
He does not wish for the people

169
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,080
to suffer needless calamities.

170
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,440
Once Ling An and Pingxiang sign the alliance treaty,

171
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,600
a century of peace will be secured.

172
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,960
I've heard enough of these official words.

173
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,600
It's just one thing to your face,

174
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,440
and another behind your back.

175
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,720
Why are you laughing?

176
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,520
I'm laughing at the Regent.

177
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,280
Such pointless caution.

178
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,280
If Ling An truly wanted to attack Pingxiang,

179
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,880
why would we send me as envoy?

180
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,120
Besides,

181
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,040
how could Pingxiang even fight Ling An?

182
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,720
Has the Regent forgotten

183
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,640
how our General of Pacification, Nan Xingxiao,

184
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,040
forced your troops back thirty li?

185
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,960
You dared not face him in battle.

186
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,040
Nan Xingxiao has been dead nearly twenty years.

187
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,880
Ling An now values scholars over warriors.

188
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,360
There is no one left to use.

189
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,080
Pingxiang

190
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,240
need not be constrained by you anymore.

191
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,120
If Ling An does not fight,

192
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,480
Pingxiang could well fight.

193
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,840
Does the Regent think

194
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,760
with just twenty percent of Qian Yuan's grain

195
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,880
you could challenge Ling An?

196
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,800
That's just short-sighted.

197
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,040
Ling An has thrived for a century.

198
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,640
Talents emerge one after another.

199
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,360
You try to fight with such outdated intelligence.

200
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,800
In the end, all you'll get

201
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,880
is to run out of ammunition and provisions.

202
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,320
Your nation's land

203
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,960
will be trampled by Ling An's cavalry.

204
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,960
You'll only regret it then.

205
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,160
It'll be too late.

206
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,240
Why not just now

207
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,320
open your borders wide

208
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,960
and hand over your capital

209
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,680
without resistance?

210
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,880
How dare you!

211
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,920
Your Highness,

212
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,160
you were drunk yesterday.

213
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,240
This is a court meeting,

214
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,720
not a banquet at your manor.

215
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,920
Or do you

216
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,160
want to liven things up with sword dancing?

217
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,280
How pedantic.

218
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,240
Step aside.

219
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,880
Forming an alliance benefits both nations.

220
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,800
But giving Ling An full control of the trade route

221
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,920
letting foreign envoys oversee key routes—

222
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,240
I could not sleep soundly.

223
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,720
Better to have both nations station people together.

224
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,560
As for repairs and route selection,

225
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,520
Ling An will have to handle that.

226
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,520
That was my oversight.

227
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,160
The Prince of Pingxiang

228
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,240
is more thoughtful.

229
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,080
Since we've opened mutual trade,

230
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,760
envoys will inevitably visit each other.

231
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,480
But right now,

232
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,640
the procedures are far too complicated.

233
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,240
Regent, please

234
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,920
revise and discuss them again.

235
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,800
Then submit a memorial to the palace.

236
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,320
If I wish to meet, I will.

237
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,520
If not, the Ministry of Rites will receive you.

238
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,200
The palace guards will also be changed.

239
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,080
We'll discuss this after Lord Rui leaves.

240
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,480
We'll close the doors and talk.

241
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,760
Since

242
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,800
mutual trade is settled,

243
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,640
I will soon

244
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,080
set out to return home.

245
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,760
I'll arrange all necessary matters.

246
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,960
Draft the state document and affix the seal.

247
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,920
Conclude the alliance treaty.

248
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,640
You're awake.

249
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,520
How do you feel?

250
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,240
Much better.

251
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,400
The medicine is bitter.

252
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,080
Have a candied fruit.

253
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,760
So now I

254
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,880
owe you my life.

255
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,280
I truly don't know

256
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,960
how to repay this favor.

257
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,760
Just owe it for now.

258
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,200
There will be plenty of chances later.

259
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,000
Are you truly dissatisfied

260
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,000
with His Majesty?

261
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,760
I...

262
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,440
Honestly, I can't say if I'm satisfied or not.

263
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,360
Since he took the throne,

264
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,240
he has implemented many new policies.

265
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,680
But the previous Emperor's unfairness to generals

266
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,000
is hard to erase.

267
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,000
None of this has changed to this day.

268
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,440
Even if Lord Rui

269
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,560
tries to bridge civil and military relations,

270
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,480
military officers are still wronged.

271
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,000
They get accused of all sorts of crimes.

272
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,240
If one day

273
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,200
His Majesty lets generals

274
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,120
regain their rightful place,

275
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,120
and gives them the fairness they deserve,

276
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,680
would you change your view of him?

277
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,560
I'm always clear about favors and grudges.

278
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,360
If he truly proves he's not like his father,

279
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,120
and is a wise ruler,

280
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,640
I will naturally change my opinion.

281
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,560
I seem a bit hungry now.

282
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,320
You've just cleared the toxins.

283
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,280
I'll make you some porridge and light dishes.

284
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,120
A few days of care and you'll recover.

285
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,520
But Master Yu

286
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,520
wants me to learn all the herbs in three days.

287
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,280
I'll pick them and show you.

288
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,520
So I owe you even more.

289
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,640
I can't repay it all at once.

290
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,400
Can I pay you back in parts?

291
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,280
I told you,

292
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,200
there will be plenty of chances later.

293
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,000
Rest well first.

294
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,280
I'll go make you some food.

295
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,680
I wonder how they're doing.

296
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,440
Wait until tomorrow.

297
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,320
I'll hand this to Hou Xian.

298
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,640
Then we can return to Ling An.

299
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,520
What about the Princess?

300
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,920
With this alliance treaty,

301
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,520
the Qian Yuan marriage alliance threat

302
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,840
won't trouble us anymore.

303
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,800
We can finally go home.

304
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,200
Master Rui,

305
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,240
you truly dominated today.

306
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,880
Watching you,

307
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,080
I was fired up!

308
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,640
Honestly,

309
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,000
I was a bit nervous

310
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,560
in my heart back then.

311
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,200
It concerned both nations,

312
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,120
so I worried something might go wrong.

313
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,400
My palms were sweating.

314
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,800
I thought you feared Hou Qi's sword.

315
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,000
That sword,

316
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,360
I wasn't afraid of it.

317
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,320
Why not?

318
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,760
Because I knew

319
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,520
you were behind me.

320
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,360
Are you afraid now?

321
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,000
Not exactly afraid.

322
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,720
Just waiting for both nations

323
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,120
to exchange state documents,

324
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,040
and start building the trade route,

325
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,000
then I'll truly feel at ease.

326
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,400
They say a hug brings comfort.

327
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,400
Want to try it?

328
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,200
I...

329
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,680
Maybe not.

330
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,120
Just try it.

331
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,760
Just once.

332
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,600
I know you bear the Rui family's future.

333
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,760
And Your Majesty's expectations.

334
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,640
I only wish to support you,

335
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,840
not be a burden.

336
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,880
As for being husband and wife,

337
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,880
I won't force you.

338
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,720
Let's take it slow.

339
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,280
I trust you.

340
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,000
Don't follow me.

341
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,280
Princess!

342
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,520
Be careful.

343
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,280
Princess...

344
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,880
Please stop making a fuss.

345
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,040
I don't care.

346
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,920
Storybooks are all lies.

347
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,480
Nothing I like is real.

348
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,280
No one likes me.

349
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,400
I...

350
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,640
Might as well agree to a marriage alliance.

351
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,760
Qian Yuan prince, Prince of Pingxiang—

352
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,480
Come on!

353
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,760
Whoever marries me, I'll marry them!

354
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,760
Oh my god...

355
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,000
How much did you drink?

356
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,480
Who let her drink?

357
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,280
She wanted wine after her nap.

358
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,760
Who dares refuse her?

359
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,000
What's wrong with the Princess?

360
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,160
Brother Yu!

361
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,640
You came at the right time.

362
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,920
You decide for my royal brother.

363
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,520
I want to stay

364
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,360
in Pingxiang for a marriage alliance.

365
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,640
Isn't the Prince of Pingxiang quite young?

366
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,160
I'll marry him!

367
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,640
He's only fourteen.

368
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,640
He's not even your generation.

369
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,160
Can you sober up?

370
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,160
Older women are a treasure.

371
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,000
Isn't Pingxiang poor?

372
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,360
If I marry for alliance,

373
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,240
won't he

374
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,600
gain a mountain of gold?

375
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,360
Oh my god...

376
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,280
Wicked fox!

377
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,400
Write to Wang Guanshan now.

378
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,240
Tell him to write me

379
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,480
a play about the Princess's marriage alliance.

380
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,520
Let me

381
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,480
be remembered for ages!

382
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:12,760
Rui Wang,

383
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,880
the trouble you caused,

384
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,920
you fix it.

385
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:16,640
I...

386
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,280
Fine.

387
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,400
While you're drunk,

388
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,040
you'll forget by morning.

389
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,600
I'll come clean.

390
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,280
I am Wang Guanshan.

391
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,120
What other story do you want?

392
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,360
Just say it all at once.

393
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,760
I won't write it anyway.

394
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,800
I want you to live in your imagination.

395
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,280
What's wrong with imagination?

396
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,000
Without imagination,

397
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,280
we're just walking corpses.

398
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,760
Tell me,

399
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,520
who are you?

400
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,400
I'm your fox ancestor!

401
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,160
Your ance—

402
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,160
Princess...

403
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,880
She's your responsibility now.

404
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,280
What do you mean, my responsibility?

405
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,360
Let's rest too.

406
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,400
Let's go.

407
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,400
About earlier...

408
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,400
Next time.

409
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,480
We'll continue next time.

410
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,880
Farewell, farewell.

411
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:33,880
You all...

412
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,640
Stinky fox!

413
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,360
Wicked fox!

414
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,240
You're up.

415
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,880
Are you still feeling unwell?

416
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,240
I'm all better now.

417
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,040
Let me help you.

418
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:00,760
Perfect timing.

419
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,640
I need to help Aunt Wang dry cured meat in the village.

420
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,240
Just lay out these herbs.

421
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,560
I'll go with you then.

422
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,160
What about these herbs?

423
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:12,760
True.

424
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,760
You go, I'll do the drying.

425
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,760
I'm heading out then.

426
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,680
I've saved you food, remember to eat.

427
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,480
Be careful on the road.

428
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,840
It's been ages since I played chess.

429
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,600
Any

430
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,600
interest?

431
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,680
Sure.

432
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,800
You've been on this mountain for days.

433
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,920
Aren't you worried about your mother's illness?

434
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,560
It's because I'm worried.

435
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,400
So I want to pass your test.

436
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,920
To cure my mother's illness.

437
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,320
My test—

438
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,040
I'm afraid you'll never pass it.

439
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,160
Why?

440
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,240
Your mother—

441
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,920
Her name is Guo Yu, right?

442
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,080
She was once My Queen.

443
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,440
Daughter of the famed Duke of Dingguo.

444
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,080
Now the Queen Mother.

445
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,640
Actually, your mother's illness is like Lady Nan's.

446
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,400
It's not hard to cure.

447
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,960
Back in those days,

448
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,440
she and the Previous Emperor

449
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,880
were young and in love.

450
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,600
They shared joys and hardships.

451
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,840
Truly enviable.

452
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,800
My mother has mentioned it before.

453
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,440
You served at my father's side

454
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,120
as his strategist for many years.

455
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,280
After helping him become emperor,

456
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,800
you resigned your post

457
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,080
and retired.

458
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,320
I suppose

459
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,320
it was due to political differences

460
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,680
with my father.

461
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,120
I understand.

462
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,600
Follow this prescription.

463
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,080
Your mother will recover with this medicine.

464
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,800
But a few herbs are quite rare.

465
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,680
With your skills,

466
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,760
finding them shouldn't be hard.

467
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,920
I don't agree with my father's politics either.

468
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,080
I've tried to make up for it all these years.

469
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,320
A good minister can mend things.

470
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,560
So I hope

471
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,040
Master,

472
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,160
you and I can resolve our differences.

473
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,280
I've lived in seclusion for years.

474
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,800
The grudges of the world

475
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,440
no longer concern me.

476
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,320
But as for Miss Youyi,

477
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,480
you shouldn't deceive her.

478
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,600
I don't care about your reasons

479
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,680
or your motives.

480
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,240
If you truly care for her,

481
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,880
treat her well.

482
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,040
Show some sincerity as a man.

483
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,360
I admit

484
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,400
defeat.

485
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,080
Your Highness.

486
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,000
Your Highness.

487
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,520
The Ling An group has already—

488
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,920
Old fool!

489
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,160
I

490
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,960
will take your command soon enough.

491
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,440
Has Rui Yu's group left?

492
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,440
They've already left.

493
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,600
Rui Yu is deeply cunning.

494
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,920
A skilled orator.

495
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,680
He settled trade between two nations in a few words.

496
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,920
This young man

497
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,760
is truly talented.

498
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,920
If he returns to Ling An,

499
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,240
he'll be Pingxiang's greatest threat.

500
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,440
You mean—

501
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,960
Send some men to watch them.

502
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,680
Wait until they've left the pass.

503
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,200
Yes, Your Highness.

504
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,040
I think I drank fake wine yesterday.

505
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,320
Why do I feel so awful?

506
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,320
Princess.

507
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,880
How about some tea?

508
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,240
I feel like I forgot something important.

509
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,680
Let me think.

510
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,160
What was it?

511
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,680
I dreamed of Wang Guanshan.

512
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,920
But in the dream, Wang Guanshan scolded me.

513
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,880
When I tried to retort,

514
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,800
I couldn't say a word.

515
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,680
It was so frustrating!

516
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,360
Princess.

517
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,600
Maybe eat something?

518
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,560
It might help you feel better.

519
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,200
My head...

520
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,600
My head—my head can't move.

521
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,000
Come here, let me lean on you.

522
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,440
Come here, let me lean on you.

523
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,960
Master, it's time to eat.

524
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,440
Where's Young Master Lin?

525
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,600
I gave him the prescription.

526
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,960
He went down the mountain.

527
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:30,800
What?

528
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,000
Weren't you going to test him more?

529
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,360
Do you know who he is?

530
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,760
He is—

531
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,480
Young Master Lin from the Hanlin Academy.

532
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,000
He lied to you.

533
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,320
He's not who he claims to be.

534
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,200
How could that be?

535
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,600
I advise you

536
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,680
to cut all ties with him.

537
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,440
Settle all grudges.

538
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,360
So you won't get dragged into pointless strife.

539
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,680
Even if you must break it off,

540
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,240
he shouldn't have left without a word.

541
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,760
I'll go find him now.

542
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:27,960
Roving bandits!

543
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:28,640
Be careful!

544
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,800
Why are there bandits here?

545
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,320
Pingxiang's border has always been unstable.

546
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,760
Now with royal infighting,

547
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,160
it's even more chaotic.

548
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,760
Get the Princess out of here!

549
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,520
Chongming!

550
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,480
Go with your second brother.

551
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,520
Make sure they're safe.

552
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:48,960
Yes.

553
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,600
You all go together.

554
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,360
You go too.

555
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,200
Then be careful, all of you.

556
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:52,480
Let's go.

557
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,000
Hurry!

558
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:53,840
Yes, sir!

559
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,160
Go!

560
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,040
Princess!

561
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,040
Liang Jin!

562
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:00,880
Sit tight.

563
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:01,680
Giddy-up!

564
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,360
Giddy-up!

565
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,400
Careful!

566
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,200
Rui Yu!
