1
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,840
Actually, I...

2
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,520
am a man.

3
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,200
What?

4
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,080
This secret concerns the life and death
of my Nan family.

5
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,280
You are a good person.

6
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,800
I hope, since I saved your life,

7
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,400
you'll keep the Nan family safe.

8
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,880
Alright.

9
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,360
Okay.

10
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:23,880
I will.

11
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,800
If I die,

12
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,280
this marriage

13
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,480
will no longer exist.

14
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:35,600
I...

15
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,480
But I hope you can let the Military
Imperial Examination

16
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,400
proceed smoothly.

17
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,120
go forward.

18
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,240
How do you know about
the Military Imperial Examination?

19
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,880
Chenxiao.

20
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,800
Chenxiao.

21
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,200
Chenxiao!

22
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,560
I will keep you safe.

23
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:42,920
Trust me.

24
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,120
Is anyone there?

25
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,600
Open the door!

26
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,920
Is anyone here?

27
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:24,800
Search over there.

28
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,560
Leave no survivors.

29
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,640
Yes.

30
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,080
Rui Wang.

31
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,680
Why are you here?

32
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,520
Mind your manners.

33
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,240
Call me Second Brother.

34
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,040
Weren't you in Pingxiang?

35
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,040
I'm here for business.

36
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,600
But why are you here?

37
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,280
And in such a mess?

38
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,080
I can't explain everything now.

39
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,480
Do you have forsythia here?

40
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,920
Large-leaf Green and Pulsatilla root?

41
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,400
Yes, I do.

42
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:04,720
I'll get them for you.

43
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,400
Hurry up.

44
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,280
This one.

45
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,240
Come with me.

46
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,320
Wait, wait.

47
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,240
Let's go.

48
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,520
Chenxiao.

49
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,400
The campfire is still warm.

50
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,960
It's been about half an hour.

51
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,840
They should still be alive.

52
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,960
Where are you going next?

53
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,920
I'll escort you there.

54
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,240
The County Deputy's residence.

55
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,840
Where exactly are you?

56
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,480
Second Young Master Rui.

57
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,440
Well?

58
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,840
My people sent word.

59
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:21,840
In Qirong City.

60
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,000
No sign of your sister-in-law.

61
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:26,720
Yu'er.

62
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,280
Sir.

63
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,480
Yu'er.

64
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,560
At least eat something.

65
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,640
Eating so little under stress

66
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,040
won't last long.

67
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,800
I'm fine.

68
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,600
When will the Pingxiang officials arrive?

69
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,440
Someone's already gone to fetch them.

70
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:46,760
Young Prince.

71
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,280
Don't worry.

72
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,520
You'll soon return home.

73
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,760
Brother Yu...

74
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,240
I...

75
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,400
I might not be able to go back.

76
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:58,880
Why?

77
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,040
I was sent to Ling An at one year old.

78
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,400
It's been fourteen years.

79
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,920
Even my mother may not recognize me.

80
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,080
They'll question my identity.

81
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,680
That doesn't matter.

82
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,200
As long as you show your personal seal,

83
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,480
you can prove who you are.

84
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,200
Where is your personal seal?

85
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,680
I feared someone would steal it
while I was bathing.

86
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,040
So I hid it.

87
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,000
I was attacked right after dressing.

88
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,120
I couldn't bring it out.

89
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,080
Young Prince.

90
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,200
Where did you hide it?

91
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,080
Under my bed in my room.

92
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,600
I'll send someone to get it now.

93
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:35,720
Lord Rui.

94
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,200
The Pingxiang officials have arrived.

95
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:38,880
Second Brother.

96
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,800
Send someone quickly to find it.

97
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,600
I'll go meet the Pingxiang officials first.

98
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,600
I'll buy us some time.

99
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,720
Then don't worry.

100
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,600
Your health matters most.

101
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:48,880
Lead the way.

102
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,080
Please.

103
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,120
Lord Rui, Lord Rui!

104
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,600
You've arrived.

105
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,880
Thank you, Lord Rui,

106
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,360
for escorting the Young Prince.

107
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,160
It was a pleasure to see the border scenery.

108
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,800
It was quite an experience.

109
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,160
May I ask, the Young Prince—

110
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,800
where is he now?

111
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,240
The journey has been tiring.

112
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,160
He's exhausted.

113
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,040
He's still sleeping.

114
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,480
He'll wake up soon.

115
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,200
Then he'll come over.

116
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,280
There's no rush.

117
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,800
However...

118
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,040
We'd like to verify the Young Prince's
personal seal first.

119
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,400
After all, when the Young Prince was in Ling An...

120
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,320
Are you saying

121
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,280
our Ling An

122
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,160
would swap him for someone else?

123
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,040
That's not what I meant.

124
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,440
But it's better

125
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,120
to be cautious.

126
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,440
Then do you know

127
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,040
the Young Prince was attacked at the border?

128
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,840
The assassin's sword

129
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,680
came from your Pingxiang army.

130
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,480
This...

131
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,480
From our army?

132
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,760
That must be a misunderstanding.

133
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,720
If today

134
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,840
I hand the Young Prince to you

135
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,600
and something goes wrong,

136
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,000
won't Ling An be blamed?

137
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,640
Lord Rui, that's too harsh.

138
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,440
We

139
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,640
would never harm the Young Prince.

140
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,440
Then please,

141
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,080
show the transfer document

142
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,240
for me to review.

143
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,000
Why?

144
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,560
Why is the National Seal missing?

145
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,480
This...

146
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,080
If that's the case,

147
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,360
we can't hand over the Young Prince today.

148
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,760
Once we enter Pingxiang tomorrow,

149
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
please present the official transfer document.

150
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,680
Then you may take the Young Prince.

151
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,480
Lord Rui! Lord Rui!

152
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,680
Lord Rui.

153
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,160
Lord Rui.

154
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,320
Rui Yu.

155
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,240
Don't worry.

156
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,320
Everything will work out naturally.

157
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,920
Do you really want me to owe you this much?

158
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,360
Yu'er.

159
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,720
Lord Rui.

160
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,800
There's a woman at the door

161
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,560
claiming to be Madam Rui, asking for you.

162
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,720
I won't see her.

163
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,320
Yes.

164
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,840
Wait.

165
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,520
Who did she say she was?

166
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,840
She said she's Madam Rui.

167
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,360
Yu'er.

168
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:19,640
My lord.

169
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,800
I'll go get an umbrella.

170
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,920
Nan Chenxiao.

171
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,960
You're still alive!

172
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,320
What are you saying?

173
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,800
I thought you were dead.

174
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,120
You get winded after just two steps.

175
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,160
And you didn't even bring an umbrella.

176
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,200
Can you handle it?

177
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,160
I'm just glad you're okay.

178
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,480
I...

179
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,280
I...

180
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,520
Rui Yu.

181
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:40,760
My lord.

182
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,640
He's awake.

183
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,240
Finally, you're awake.

184
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,040
What happened to me?

185
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,480
You overworked yourself.

186
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,400
You fainted, that's all.

187
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,560
Get me some more soup.

188
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,520
Just now,

189
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,400
I think I saw Nan Chenxiao.

190
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,680
I'm full.

191
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,240
How's your poisoning?

192
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,680
Thanks to you,

193
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,520
I'm mostly fine now.

194
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,680
That's good.

195
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,520
My people checked the post station.

196
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,360
It's completely burned to ashes.

197
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,400
There's nothing left.

198
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,760
What should we do now?

199
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,960
Take a look.

200
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:32,840
Is this

201
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,200
what you're looking for?

202
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,080
I'll ask the Young Prince to confirm.

203
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,200
You just woke up.

204
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,040
Just send someone else.

205
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,280
Fu Lü.

206
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,320
He should not be a lovesick fool in life.

207
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,600
There's no place in this world

208
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,240
for longing and love.

209
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:09,760
Young Prince.

210
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,920
Please check if this is your personal seal.

211
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,080
Yes.

212
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,640
Thank you, Brother Yu.

213
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,080
Mother once said

214
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,560
we must repay kindness.

215
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,600
From now on, you're my brothers and sisters.

216
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,040
Honored guests of Pingxiang.

217
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,560
Tomorrow, you can return home.

218
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,640
You'll see your mother again.

219
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,880
Will we...

220
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,680
ever meet again?

221
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,640
When Hou Xian becomes King of Pingxiang,

222
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,080
he'll have responsibilities

223
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,840
beyond his own life.

224
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,320
We are now ruler and subject.

225
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,040
I'm afraid after this farewell,

226
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,760
we may never meet again.

227
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,800
We definitely will.

228
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,560
Brother Yu.

229
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,040
This token belongs only to Pingxiang royalty.

230
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,600
If you ever come to Pingxiang,

231
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,200
just show this token.

232
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,360
No one will dare bully you.

233
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,040
You must always remember

234
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,280
the mission you carry.

235
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,080
I will be a good king.

236
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,480
Just like Your Majesty of Ling An.

237
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,520
I...

238
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,680
feel a bit uneasy.

239
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,920
I suspect tomorrow's envoy

240
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,320
might be Hou Qi's man.

241
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:32,920
That's not hard.

242
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,880
I can escort Hou Xian out.

243
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,400
If we thought of it,

244
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,000
so did Hou Qi's people.

245
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,440
They'll expect it too.

246
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,800
When we leave the city tomorrow,

247
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,360
they'll check anyone Hou Xian's age

248
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,480
very strictly.

249
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,680
They have experts.

250
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,560
But we have Fu Lü!

251
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:55,880
Let's go.

252
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:56,680
The document.

253
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,560
I didn't expect

254
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,160
Fu Lü can also disguise herself.

255
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,160
She's still not as good as me.

256
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,640
After all, I taught her.

257
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,320
That's true.

258
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,600
Your injury—

259
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,920
how is it?

260
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Thanks to your quick help,

261
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,000
it's nothing serious.

262
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,280
By the way,

263
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,240
you and Second Brother—

264
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,560
did you plan this in advance?

265
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,560
I only found out last night.

266
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,720
He left home this time

267
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,360
just to come to Qirong City.

268
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,600
You civil officials' families are odd.

269
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,600
You even keep secrets from your own family.

270
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,280
So,

271
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,000
how did you get to Qirong City?

272
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,320
Me?

273
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,560
When I woke up,

274
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,680
you were gone.

275
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,600
I thought something bad happened to you.

276
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,600
So I went out to look for you.

277
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,120
Where did Rui Yu go?

278
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,760
I kept searching for you,

279
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,840
but even at dawn, you were nowhere to be found.

280
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,240
So I decided to check Qirong City nearby.

281
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,400
On the way,

282
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,640
I met a farmer.

283
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:31,960
Miss,

284
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,040
come over here.

285
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,120
I'll give you a ride.

286
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,240
We can only take it

287
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,000
one step at a time.

288
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,400
Found it.

289
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,280
That man is a good person.

290
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,360
I treated my wound again at his home.

291
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,680
He even found me some clothes.

292
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,360
Please have someone send them some money later.

293
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,240
To show our thanks.

294
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,400
I'll take care of it soon.

295
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,400
Speaking of which,

296
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,560
it's so dangerous outside.

297
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,840
Where did you go alone?

298
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:20,920
I...

299
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,840
went to get you medicine.

300
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,240
But now it seems

301
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,120
you don't need it anymore.

302
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,160
Is it for detoxifying?

303
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,400
I'll keep your secret for you.

304
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,560
Please trust me.

305
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,600
Understood.

306
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,640
Actually...

307
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,840
I also have a secret.

308
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,520
Miss.

309
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,320
Sir.

310
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,720
It's time to depart.

311
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:14,960
Let's go.

312
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,040
Where to?

313
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,800
To the market.

314
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,960
Hou Xian has left the city.

315
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,920
We should return to the capital and report.

316
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,440
It's rare for us to get out.

317
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,600
Who knows when we'll get another chance.

318
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,040
We should enjoy ourselves while we can.

319
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,480
He's a grown man,

320
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,240
stuck at home all day.

321
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,440
It's truly pitiful.

322
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,080
As you wish.

323
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,640
Get ready.

324
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,880
We'll go to the market soon.

325
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,720
Young Master Nan,

326
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,880
you can wear men's clothes to have fun.

327
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:50,800
Thanks.

328
00:19:59,200 --> 00:19:59,800
Your Highness.

329
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,720
A message from Hou Qi.

330
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,160
Besides asking for money and people,

331
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,560
what else will he do?

332
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,440
You mean...

333
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,760
Let’s stall for now.

334
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,720
He needs to know

335
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,560
who he can touch

336
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,600
and who he can't.

337
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,200
Your Majesty.

338
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,280
About the assassination attempt,

339
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,560
Chongming has already reported back.

340
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,040
On this trip,

341
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,520
did you discover anything else?

342
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,200
When I reached Ya'an,

343
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,880
I found the local post officials

344
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,280
were acting suspiciously.

345
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:57,720
During the day,

346
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,920
there were no street vendors at all.

347
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,520
After I was attacked at night,

348
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,960
I returned to Ya'an to seek medicine.

349
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,080
Yet the patrolling soldiers on the road

350
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,160
did nothing about the commotion.

351
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,240
I suspect

352
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,800
some border officials

353
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,600
are colluding with Pingxiang.

354
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,720
Border officials

355
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,440
I'll assign someone to investigate their collusion with Pingxiang.

356
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,960
The list of candidates from the local exam

357
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,520
and their essays

358
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,320
are being handled by the Hanlin Academy.

359
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,560
Pay special attention

360
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,440
to examinees from border cities.

361
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I will go now.

362
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,600
I take my leave.

363
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,600
Sir, you must be tired from travel.

364
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,840
Why not stay at Yuqing Cottage tonight?

365
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:48,560
No, thank you.

366
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,440
Just prepare some hot water in my room.

367
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,720
Yes, sir.

368
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,800
You're back, Little Yu.

369
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:56,960
Sister-in-law.

370
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,200
You've just returned from a long trip.

371
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,520
You should get some rest.

372
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,560
But...

373
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,520
Prince Pan is here.

374
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,480
Prince Pan?

375
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,920
Did he come to visit you?

376
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,000
Yes.

377
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,440
Father said

378
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,360
to talk with you when you return.

379
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,400
After all, you're the only official in our family now.

380
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,680
I understand.

381
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,040
Should we invite Chenxiao too?

382
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,640
Given his identity,

383
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,040
it's best he avoids contact with others.

384
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,080
No need.

385
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,640
Madam is also tired.

386
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,720
Let him rest.

387
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,400
Alright.

388
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,400
Then go ahead.

389
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,040
I'll have the kitchen serve the food.

390
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,640
Okay.

391
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,360
Your Highness, please have some tea.

392
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,080
Thank you.

393
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:40,680
Lord Rui.

394
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,440
Your Highness.

395
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,600
I only meant to visit my aunt.

396
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,480
Didn't expect to trouble you as well.

397
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,880
It's rare for Your Highness to visit.

398
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,640
Of course you must stay for a meal.

399
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,360
Thank you.

400
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,720
No need to be polite, we're family.

401
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,480
From now on,

402
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,200
just call Rui Yu

403
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,600
Uncle, that's enough.

404
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,680
Lord Rui doesn't look well.

405
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,560
I got an old ginseng root recently.

406
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,360
When I return,

407
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,040
I'll send it to you.

408
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,160
I appreciate Your Highness's kindness.

409
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,120
I just haven't slept well from traveling.

410
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,560
No need to worry.

411
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,760
How could I not be concerned?

412
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,080
Miss

413
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,040
Reading while walking
will hurt your eyes.

414
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,560
Why not wait a bit
before reading again?

415
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:26,880
Liang Jin

416
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,440
You can't call me "Miss."

417
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,880
No matter who's around,

418
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,960
you must call me Third Young Master.

419
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,600
Yes, Third Young Master.

420
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,120
Since that day,

421
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,160
I decided you would be my bride.

422
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,040
But fate had other plans.

423
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,520
Once I return to Qian Yuan
and claim the throne,

424
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,960
I can marry you openly.

425
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:47,960
By the way,

426
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,520
I heard

427
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,680
you ran into bandits
on your journey.

428
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,800
You and Nan Chenxiao
almost fell off a cliff.

429
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,680
That was truly dangerous.

430
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,880
Were you hurt?

431
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,080
Those two...

432
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,480
Why are they so interested
in this trip?

433
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,000
Are they trying to test

434
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,280
Nan Chenxiao's identity?

435
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,320
We just ran into
some desperate men.

436
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,880
I'm perfectly fine.

437
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,120
Here, Prince.

438
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,400
Eat, eat, eat.

439
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,160
It's all cold now.
Come, come.

440
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:26,760
Put it on.

441
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,160
It looks nice.

442
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,760
Miss Nan gave this today.

443
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,400
Miss Nan brought gifts
for everyone.

444
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,920
Everyone was so happy.

445
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,360
He really went
to great lengths.

446
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,120
So thoughtful.

447
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,680
Little Yu

448
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,960
Are you asleep?

449
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,800
Little Yu

450
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:48,960
Hurry, put it on.

451
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,960
Sister-in-law, wait.

452
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:54,880
Come.

453
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,560
Sister-in-law.

454
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,440
What's wrong?

455
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,720
Sister-in-law wants
to talk to you.

456
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,960
Let's talk inside, then.

457
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,920
No, no.

458
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,760
Big Brother.

459
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,400
Why are you here?

460
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,720
It's late and damp outside.

461
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,960
I was worried you'd fall
coming back.

462
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,400
But there's a lantern.

463
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,640
You've never rushed
to meet me before.

464
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,040
I suddenly realized

465
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,840
Rui Yu just got to rest.

466
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,200
Let's talk tomorrow
if it's important.

467
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,800
I'll just say a few words.

468
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,960
Might as well say it here.

469
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:26,840
Sister-in-law.

470
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,000
Go ahead, speak freely.

471
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,280
Go on.

472
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,920
You're already married,

473
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,800
but you sleep in the study
every night.

474
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,120
If Your Majesty finds out,

475
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,240
he'll think the Rui family
disapproves.

476
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,680
At least sleep in the main room.

477
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,120
Sleeping in the study
every night...

478
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,200
This...

479
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,000
It really hurts Nan Chenxiao.

480
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,640
I think your sister-in-law
is right.

481
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,440
As long as you don't share a bed,

482
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,120
it's not a big deal.

483
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:52,960
I mean...

484
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,760
So lively here.

485
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,520
Big Brother, Sister-in-law,
why are you here?

486
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,160
Nan Chenxiao is here too.

487
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,160
Then I'll just say it clearly.

488
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:00,680
Madam.

489
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,200
Let go.

490
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,320
Let go, let go.

491
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,280
Me,

492
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,040
I hope you two
live well together.

493
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,680
You, every day,

494
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,200
make Third Brother
sleep in the study.

495
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,680
That's not good at all.

496
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,680
My husband is just busy.

497
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,480
I just made some late-night food.

498
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,920
I wanted him to eat
in the main room.

499
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,400
How about, husband,

500
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,800
you sleep in the main room tonight?

501
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:21,920
Let's do that, then.

502
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:22,920
So straightforward.

503
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,160
I never said I disagreed.

504
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,480
Sister-in-law just spoke
too quickly.

505
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,720
Go with Nan Chenxiao
to the main room.

506
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:31,960
Then, Sister-in-law,

507
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,960
I'll go back with your brother now.

508
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:34,720
Take this.

509
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:36,880
Hurry, go.

510
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:37,880
You two,

511
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,160
take care.

512
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,680
Take care.

513
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,880
You should rest early too.

514
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,320
Let's go.

515
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,000
How nice.

516
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,680
Really nice.

517
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,040
Madam, let's go sleep too.

518
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,440
Let's go.

519
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,880
Watch your step.

520
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,680
Hold it tight.

521
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,600
What are you doing?

522
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,520
Let's head back.

523
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,640
Isn't this a bit much?

524
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,960
Why so fussy?

525
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,440
I've been squatting
for half an hour.

526
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,640
My legs are numb.

527
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,640
So much nonsense.

528
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,360
Watch out, or I'll hit you.

529
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,320
A trip really did
bring you closer.

530
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,000
No, I need to give them something.

531
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:31,960
Go, go, go.

532
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,600
Go back.

533
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,600
I didn't expect

534
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,880
You're pretty good at this.

535
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,360
I just did what was needed.

536
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,680
Otherwise,

537
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,760
Sister-in-law would never let it go.

538
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:58,600
Then,

539
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,640
your identity would be exposed.

540
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,680
That would be bad.

541
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,880
I think it's perfect.

542
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,600
Why?

543
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:11,880
Stop pretending.

544
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,800
I've known for a long time

545
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,440
who you really are.

546
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,040
It's a dream.

547
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,640
Forgive my boldness for saying this,

548
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,000
I have always

549
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,000
seen the princess as a little sister.

550
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,160
Who wants to be your sister?

551
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,200
Princess,

552
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,400
today I

553
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,480
have said all I can.

554
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,600
I hope you won't dwell on this.

555
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,480
I'll head over there

556
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,680
and join the officials.

557
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,720
Brother Yu,

558
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,120
Brother Yu,

559
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:10,600
I

560
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:11,800
take my leave.

561
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,760
Brother Yu,

562
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,600
Princess,

563
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,760
please don't—

564
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,040
Brother Yu!

565
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,000
Someone, help!

566
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,160
Rui Yu!

567
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:26,880
Hurry, someone!

568
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,720
Lord Rui fell into the water!

569
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,720
Hurry, someone!

570
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,880
Help!

571
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,680
Brother Yu!

572
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:36,800
Go save him, quick!

573
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,320
Yes!

574
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,600
Brother Yu!

575
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,000
Brother Yu!

576
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:43,840
Rui Yu!

577
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:44,680
Rui Yu!

578
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:45,920
Are you all right?

579
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,080
Quick, prepare a guest room.

580
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,320
Let Brother Yu change his clothes.

581
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:48,840
Yes!

582
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,680
No, you can't!

583
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,920
I can't stay here—take me away.

584
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:54,720
Don't speak yet.

585
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:55,680
I'm here with you.

586
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,600
Brother Yu,

587
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,120
Where are you carrying me, Brother Yu?

588
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,600
Lord Rui,

589
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,040
Brother Yu,

590
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:14,880
Brother Yu,

591
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:29,720
My lord,

592
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,160
Get in the carriage, quick!

593
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:30,800
What's wrong with my lord?

594
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,280
Go, hurry!

595
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,280
My lord!

596
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,720
Thank you, sister-in-law.

597
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:36,800
Fu Lü,

598
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,520
Go boil some hot water.

599
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,040
What happened here?

600
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:38,280
Quick!

601
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:38,600
Okay!

602
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,880
I'll get some clean clothes.

603
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,040
Why did Yu faint?

604
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,280
No, I need to check on him.

605
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,640
Nan Chenxiao is here, why worry?

606
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,200
Yu is frail.

607
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,560
I'm afraid my sister-in-law

608
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,720
can't handle it alone.

609
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,200
He's already married.

610
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,720
Why not rely on his wife,

611
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,080
instead of you, his big brother?

612
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,640
I think

613
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,640
she truly is a general's daughter.

614
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,560
She has such a noble spirit.

615
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,400
Her stride

616
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,760
is swift as the wind.

617
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,200
Is that what matters now?

618
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,840
Go get a doctor, now!

619
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,880
I think it's nothing serious.

620
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,880
Do you even act like a brother?

621
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,560
Are you drunk?

622
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,080
Yu,

623
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,080
with Nan Chenxiao—

624
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,400
I'll go get her medicine.

625
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,320
No,

626
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,240
what are you worried about?

627
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,400
Being the big brother

628
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,640
is just too hard.

629
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,760
Careful!

630
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,960
Hot...

631
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,120
Could it be a fever?

632
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,160
Let me change your wet clothes first.

633
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,360
Don't let it get worse.

634
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,840
So hot...

635
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,000
A woman.
