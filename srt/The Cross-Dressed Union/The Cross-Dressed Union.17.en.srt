1
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,600
I just feel that with my background

2
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,040
it's better not to get too close to you.

3
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,520
What do you mean by that?

4
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,600
My family are military officers.

5
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,040
We can't afford any trouble.

6
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,440
Civil officials hold power now.

7
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,760
They've always looked down on us.

8
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,200
Those of us from military families.

9
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,240
And now,

10
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,160
we're just pawns in their factional strife.

11
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,800
My father's imprisonment is proof enough.

12
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,720
I won't let that happen again.

13
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,440
The Spring Imperial Examination is over.

14
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,120
The new officials all seek civil-military integration.

15
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:11,760
Soon,

16
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,080
that's your concern.

17
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,360
I just want a peaceful life with my father.

18
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,080
By the way,

19
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,280
where have you been lately?

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Rui Wang said

21
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,240
you chased the human traffickers' remnants

22
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,560
and then disappeared.

23
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,000
I chased those remnants

24
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,360
out of the city.

25
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,400
I didn't expect they had accomplices.

26
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,560
I was badly injured.

27
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,600
I escaped to the mountain.

28
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,240
My senior sister saved me.

29
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,360
Martial Uncle was worried

30
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,120
someone in the capital might harm me.

31
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,560
So he told me not to leave the mountain until I healed.

32
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,960
He wouldn't let me send any messages either.

33
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,920
So that's what happened.

34
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,240
Martial Uncle Yu's concern

35
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,440
is not without reason.

36
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,560
Martial Uncle really did a lot for me.

37
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,840
Nan Chenxiao,

38
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,480
let's

39
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,840
move forward.

40
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,640
Alright.

41
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,080
Let's move forward together.

42
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,480
Your Majesty,

43
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,920
Miss Qiao.

44
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,120
Your Majesty.

45
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:52,920
Slow down.

46
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,760
Thank you.

47
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,360
Why did you come up the mountain?

48
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,520
Your Majesty,

49
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,320
I had something to discuss with you.

50
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,240
So I asked Second Young Master Rui to bring us up.

51
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,000
But

52
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,200
we somehow got separated just now.

53
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,600
Princess and Second Young Master Rui are missing.

54
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,440
Yan Luo also came up the mountain.

55
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,400
It's all my fault.

56
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,520
I wanted to speak with Your Majesty,

57
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,640
so Second Young Master Rui led us up.

58
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,160
Take her back.

59
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,480
I'll go look for them.

60
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,480
How long ago did you split up?

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,840
About half an hour ago.

62
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,640
I came from that direction.

63
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,520
Alright.

64
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,400
Your Majesty,

65
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,360
this is a signal flare.

66
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,720
Set it off later,

67
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,120
and the Chongming Guard will come for you.

68
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,080
Your Majesty,

69
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,120
the Princess got lost because of me.

70
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,560
I can't just leave her.

71
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,160
Please take me with you.

72
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,480
I won't cause any trouble.

73
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,000
Then keep up on your own.

74
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,800
It's pouring so hard.

75
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,480
Why aren't they back yet?

76
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,000
Yeah.

77
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,200
Liang Jin.

78
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,520
You're back.

79
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,160
You all came back.

80
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,600
It's yours.

81
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,280
Thank you, Fu Lu.

82
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,400
Thank you, Lord Chongming.

83
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,280
Let's go.

84
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,240
Go.

85
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,160
Hold it tight.

86
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,240
What are you doing?

87
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,160
Bring the basin over.

88
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,040
Coming, coming.

89
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,080
I never thought country life was so fun.

90
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,680
If you like it,

91
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,240
we can come up the mountain often.

92
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,600
Martial Uncle may be a grumpy old man,

93
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,480
but he does enjoy lively company.

94
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,880
Your Majesty and the others won't get lost, right?

95
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,440
Don't worry.

96
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,320
Youyi grew up on this mountain.

97
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,120
She could find her way back with her eyes closed.

98
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,760
Is it that heavy?

99
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,760
Hold it steady, hold it steady.

100
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,120
Miss Qiao.

101
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,160
Careful.

102
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,320
Watch out, the path is slippery.

103
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,480
We can take shelter ahead.

104
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,520
Put it on.

105
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,080
Thank you, Miss Qiao.

106
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,760
Your Majesty, you should wear it.

107
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,480
No need.

108
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,120
I see you've been shivering.

109
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,440
You should wear it.

110
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,560
Your Majesty's health is precious.

111
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,960
Your Majesty should wear it.

112
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,080
You should wear it.

113
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:45,880
Still, Your—

114
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,040
They're just two worthless things.

115
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,480
If you both don't want to wear them, forget it.

116
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,880
No need to keep passing them around.

117
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,000
Your Majesty,

118
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,000
your clothes are soaked.

119
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,920
Go dry them by the fire.

120
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:16,960
No need.

121
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,200
If you catch a chill,

122
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,320
who will lead us out?

123
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,920
That's true.

124
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,520
If you two get sick,

125
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,000
I'll be in trouble.

126
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,120
That's not what I meant.

127
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,440
Martial Uncle only has three rooms here.

128
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,560
We must leave one for Your Majesty.

129
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,760
Chongming and I

130
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,400
will squeeze into Martial Uncle's room.

131
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,880
You and Youyi will have to share a room.

132
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,800
Miss Qiao, she—

133
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,240
She knows everything now.

134
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,040
This is clothing from Wurong Kingdom.

135
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,400
Why is there a tear?

136
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,800
And bloodstains?

137
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,200
This belongs to Martial Uncle.

138
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,200
Maybe when he went to Wurong before,

139
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,160
he wore it to gather intelligence.

140
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,200
I see.

141
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,480
On the mountain,

142
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,360
the thunder sounds even closer.

143
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,240
I used to not be afraid.

144
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,040
From now on, you won't need to be.

145
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,400
I'm here with you.

146
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,680
Nothing can hurt you now.

147
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:27,920
Young Master Nan

148
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,440
What is it?

149
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,160
Your Majesty and the others
haven't returned yet.

150
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,520
What should we do?

151
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,440
Let's go out and look for them.

152
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,080
You're awake.

153
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,480
The rain has stopped.

154
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,600
Let's go.

155
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,640
Wipe yourself off, be careful
not to catch a chill.

156
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,320
Let's go.

157
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,280
Let's go.

158
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,680
Sit closer to the fire too.

159
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,800
Don't catch a cold.

160
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,720
Weren't we out here
to look for my royal brother?

161
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,880
How did things end up like this?

162
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,440
Just bear with it for one night.

163
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,440
Wait until tomorrow.

164
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,160
Once it stops raining,
we can head out.

165
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,480
But I'm hungry.

166
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,080
This is all we have.

167
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,080
Let me see if you have
anything else.

168
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,760
Stop searching, it's all medicine.

169
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,440
Why bring so many medicine jars
and no food?

170
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,080
I'm worried what if
we get hurt.

171
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,600
I think the mountain
has plenty of resources.

172
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,400
Even if we get lost,
we can find food.

173
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,000
But the medicine we need

174
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,280
might not be easy to find
right away.

175
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,160
Why are you treating me like this?

176
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,480
Eat one.

177
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,560
It'll make you feel full.

178
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,800
Just one will make you
feel full.

179
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,560
You're really eating it?

180
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,480
Feeling full isn't
actually being full.

181
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,160
It's just psychological comfort.

182
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:02,640
You...

183
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,480
What's that sound?

184
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,800
I'm not going to die here,
am I?

185
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,280
I haven't even met
Wang Guanshan yet.

186
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,040
I haven't had him write
Princess Chunxi's story.

187
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,760
I'll regret this
for the rest of my life.

188
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,520
This regret—

189
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,040
I can help you fulfill
half of it.

190
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,600
You've already met
Wang Guanshan.

191
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,840
What are you talking about?

192
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,320
I don't understand.

193
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,240
You, you...

194
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,720
Don't tell me you are—

195
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:17,920
Come.

196
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,520
Your clothes are dry.

197
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,360
Put them on first.

198
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,560
Don't catch a cold.

199
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,720
What's wrong?

200
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,680
N-nothing.

201
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,120
Second Young Master Rui

202
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,840
Second Brother Rui

203
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,800
Let's go.

204
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,200
So polite now.

205
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,800
Not calling me
a bad fox anymore.

206
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,400
I...

207
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:07,880
You first.

208
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,440
Don't talk to me yet.

209
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,160
What a pity.

210
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,480
I was going to tell you

211
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,600
what my next story
will be about.

212
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,240
But it seems
you're not interested.

213
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,280
Then let's go.

214
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,760
What story are you writing?

215
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,440
Tell me!

216
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,880
What's your next book about?

217
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,160
You didn't finish
the carriage story last time.

218
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,800
Tell it, tell it!

219
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,640
Where did I leave off last time?

220
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,000
There was a princess.

221
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,040
There was a princess.

222
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,280
She fell for a young master
disguised as a man.

223
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,000
But this young master
disguised as a man

224
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,240
later married a general's daughter
disguised as a woman.

225
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,240
What kind of story is this?

226
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,840
Isn't this Nan Chenxiao?

227
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,200
Just missing Brother Yu.

228
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,480
He's also disguised as a man.

229
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,880
Brother Yu isn't the one
you're talking about, is he?

230
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,120
Uh...

231
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,160
Miss Qiao

232
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,080
Qiao...

233
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,920
Who is Miss Qiao?

234
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,920
Royal brother!

235
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:15,800
Greetings, Your Majesty.

236
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,840
I thought I'd never
see you again.

237
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,760
Stand up straight.

238
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,560
A princess should behave
with dignity.

239
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,200
And also—

240
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,280
Why did you sneak
out of the palace again?

241
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,440
It's because the top beam
is crooked, so the lower ones are too.

242
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:31,920
Princess!

243
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,320
Wanwan!

244
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,160
Princess!

245
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:34,960
Wanwan!

246
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,440
That's great, that's great!

247
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,840
I'm glad you're safe.

248
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,240
If something happened to you,
what would I do?

249
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,760
I'm fine, what about you?

250
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,960
I'm fine too.

251
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,200
Let's hurry back.

252
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,520
Lord Rui and my junior sister
must be worried.

253
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,560
I'm really fine.

254
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,840
Miss Qiao is right.

255
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,520
We sheltered from the rain
and made a fire.

256
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,360
I was so worried!

257
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,400
I wonder if they found
shelter from the rain.

258
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:00,920
My lord, slow down.

259
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,360
Stay close.

260
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,320
Don't get separated.

261
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,160
It's a signal from Your Majesty.

262
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,600
That way.

263
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,440
Let's go.

264
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:20,760
Go.

265
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,280
Let's go, Wanwan.

266
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,480
What's wrong?

267
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,160
Your Majesty, I have
something to tell you.

268
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,480
May I speak with you
in private?

269
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,800
Do you have something

270
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,320
you can't let us hear?

271
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,880
Wait here for a moment.

272
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,000
Royal brother.

273
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,080
Give your royal brother

274
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,160
some space.

275
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,000
So many people going
to my master—

276
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,320
He might not be happy,
not to mention—

277
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,080
What about my junior sister's identity?

278
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,880
That's true.

279
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,240
I wonder if there's
anywhere to stay on the mountain.

280
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,840
Second Young Master Rui
and Yan Luo both know.

281
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:25,760
It's just—

282
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,960
Miss Ming

283
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,240
Royal brother, where are you going?

284
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:35,960
Don't go over there.

285
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,280
Your Majesty!

286
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,080
You all—

287
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,000
Your Majesty!

288
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,160
What's going on?

289
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,080
Ming Wanwan, Princess Chunxi,

290
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,240
and your second brother
are here.

291
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,840
Why did they come?

292
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,120
They're here to find me.

293
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,080
Yan Luo and Rui Wang
are both fine.

294
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,520
Mainly—

295
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,160
Why are you staring at me?

296
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:04,920
Yes.

297
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,240
Ming Wanwan.

298
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,920
This is such a hassle.

299
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,200
How about you

300
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,480
go hide in the room for now, don't come out.

301
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,680
Then how long

302
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,160
do I have to hide?

303
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,880
Tomorrow at dawn,

304
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,840
I'll go down the mountain with them.

305
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,560
Alright.

306
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,280
Let's head back then.

307
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,000
Your Majesty, take care.

308
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,040
My master likes peace and quiet.

309
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,600
Please rest in the courtyard.

310
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,840
Go down the mountain at first light.

311
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:55,800
Sorry for disturbing you.

312
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,360
But I'm hungry.

313
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,000
I'll make you something to eat.

314
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,040
Thank you, Miss Qiao.

315
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,080
You're so kind.

316
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,280
Come.

317
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,360
Let's sit for a while too.

318
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,480
Let me help you.

319
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,200
Alright.

320
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,560
Are you hungry?

321
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,040
Food will be ready soon.

322
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:30,960
Your Majesty.

323
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,880
I have something to tell you.

324
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,720
Wait a moment.

325
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,240
It's about state affairs.

326
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,240
I...

327
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:40,960
I'll be back soon.

328
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:41,960
If you need anything,

329
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,480
just ask Chongming.

330
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,320
Your back must be sore.

331
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:06,800
What's the matter?

332
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,960
Pingxiang merchants are about to enter the capital.

333
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,240
Rui family's eldest brother is in charge.

334
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,560
But he's always been unruly.

335
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,160
So I'm worried something might go wrong.

336
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,720
That's what my father told me.

337
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,200
It's a complicated matter.

338
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,000
That's why I'm concerned.

339
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,760
You should tell Rui Yu about this.

340
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,440
Why are you telling me?

341
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,800
Could it be...

342
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,440
I was too hasty and rude.

343
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,680
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

344
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,760
I understand.

345
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,160
You've worked hard.

346
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,520
It's my duty to do this.

347
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,960
You've been busy all day.

348
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,680
You must be tired.

349
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,560
Go inside and rest.

350
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:48,920
I'm not tired.

351
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,520
I can still help out.

352
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:51,960
Let's go.

353
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,760
Miss Qiao, you're amazing.

354
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,680
Come to the palace and be my teacher.

355
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,920
Princess, I appreciate your kindness.

356
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,640
But I'm used to being free.

357
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,320
Life in the palace is too restrictive.

358
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,280
That's true.

359
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,360
I think so too.

360
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,000
Life outside the palace is much more fun.

361
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,040
Miss Qiao.

362
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:27,920
Is this enough?

363
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,000
It's enough.

364
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,480
Before the rain, I saw the flower's core.

365
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,680
After the rain, no flower beneath the leaves.

366
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,760
Is there something on my face?

367
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,160
That's odd.

368
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,080
Why didn't I notice before?

369
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,760
Notice what?

370
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,400
It's nothing.

371
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,640
When are we having dinner?

372
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,280
Eating in the mountains,

373
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,520
we have to work first.

374
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:15,560
Come.

375
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:16,840
Let's shell beans.

376
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,480
But I don't know how.

377
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,840
Come, I'll teach you.

378
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,280
Let me help you serve.

379
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,160
Wanwan.

380
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,560
Come help shell beans.

381
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,600
No beans, no dinner tonight.

382
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,040
Let's do it together.

383
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,160
It's so lively.

384
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,680
What a pity.

385
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,160
We can only stay inside.

386
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,720
Someday,

387
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,240
you'll meet them openly and proudly.

388
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,680
Take off your coat.

389
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,920
I'll help you apply medicine.

390
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:30,680
Uh...

391
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,120
Isn't this a bit inappropriate?

392
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,080
We're husband and wife.

393
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,480
What's wrong with that?

394
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,160
Hurry up.

395
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:18,880
Does it hurt?

396
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:20,880
No.

397
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,640
My wound is almost healed.

398
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,560
No need for more medicine.

399
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,360
Your ears are so red.

400
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,280
Did you catch a cold?

401
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,680
Stop messing around.

402
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,280
I'm not messing around.

403
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,920
Let's sleep.

404
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,480
Don't catch a chill.

405
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,680
There are many poisonous insects here.

406
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,000
Don't get hurt.

407
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,960
I know you're mad at me.

408
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,080
I came up here to explain things to you.

409
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,880
I'm not angry.

410
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,280
Then look at me.

411
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,440
I just think

412
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,000
Ming Wanwan

413
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,760
is the one best suited to stand by your side.

414
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,120
She's not.

415
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,800
She's the most famous talent in the capital.

416
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,680
Stunningly beautiful.

417
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,160
Graceful and well-mannered.

418
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,400
The Empress Dowager

419
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,800
likes her very much too.

420
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,920
But I don't like her.

421
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,280
I like you.

422
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,840
You're a cloud in the sky.

423
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,920
I can only chase you from the ground.

424
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,720
Even if our hearts connect, so what?

425
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,160
You're not Young Master Lin.

426
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,800
And I'm just Miss Qiao.

427
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,960
If military officers regain power,

428
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,440
our statuses

429
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,640
won't be an unbridgeable gap.

430
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,400
Tonight, the mountain wind feels warmer.

431
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,560
Yes.

432
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,000
Spring is here.

433
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:10,920
It's getting warmer.

434
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:26,960
You're awake.

435
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,320
Sleep a bit more.

436
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,480
Why are you up already?

437
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,960
What if Miss Ming and the others see you?

438
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,960
Youyi already took them down the mountain.

439
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,040
They've gone down.

440
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,960
Everything that needed to be said is said.

441
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,720
Staying here is pointless.

442
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,600
The mountain air is so fresh.

443
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,240
I want to come back and visit again.

444
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:55,640
Next time,

445
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,680
I'll take you to climb another mountain.

446
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,360
Sure!

447
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,320
Careful!

448
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,080
It's fine.

449
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,120
Princess, slow down.

450
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:11,800
Watch out.

451
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,040
You're being too careless.

452
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,120
Wanwan, slow down.

453
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,560
Be careful.

454
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,200
Just keep walking straight on this path

455
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,400
and you'll reach the foot of the mountain.

456
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,640
Miss Qiao, aren't you coming with us?

457
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,200
No.

458
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,880
I'm staying on the mountain a while longer.

459
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,240
Let's part ways here, then.

460
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,200
Alright.

461
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,200
Goodbye, Miss Qiao.

462
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,680
Farewell.

463
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,320
Let's go.

464
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,120
Take it slow.
