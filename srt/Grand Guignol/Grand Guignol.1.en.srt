5
00:02:17,088 --> 00:02:18,555
This grudge,

6
00:02:19,548 --> 00:02:21,975
should I leave it unresolved?

7
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:27,564
Due to your greed,

8
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,777
I have lost everything.

9
00:02:52,265 --> 00:02:54,633
I only did those things out of love.

10
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:56,968
Please believe me.

11
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:59,137
I still love you deeply,

12
00:02:59,668 --> 00:03:01,056
from the depths of my heart.

13
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:04,976
If that is the case...

14
00:03:06,788 --> 00:03:09,398
there is only one thing I desire.

15
00:03:11,363 --> 00:03:12,574
Reincarnation.

16
00:03:13,873 --> 00:03:15,570
To a new world.

17
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:34,798
Hurts...

18
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:35,981
It hurts!

19
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:37,759
Let us meet in the next life.

20
00:03:43,629 --> 00:03:44,672
It hurts!

21
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:56,607
A towel! A towel! It hurts!

22
00:03:57,674 --> 00:03:58,602
Alright, cut.

23
00:03:58,899 --> 00:04:01,950
It hurts!

24
00:04:06,088 --> 00:04:08,165
It hurts!

25
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:09,207
Are you okay?

26
00:04:09,994 --> 00:04:11,231
Hey, Hiru.

27
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,254
You did it again, didn't you?

28
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:23,295
Ugh,

29
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:25,682
what's this? Vinegar?

30
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,231
Geez,

31
00:04:33,255 --> 00:04:36,131
Hiruko, why are you always up to pranks?

32
00:04:36,155 --> 00:04:37,652
It's not just a prank.

33
00:04:37,676 --> 00:04:40,284
I did it to add realism to the acting.

34
00:04:40,284 --> 00:04:42,487
It could be expressed through acting!

35
00:04:42,581 --> 00:04:45,702
That's assuming you're good at acting.

36
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:46,601
Hey.

37
00:04:46,913 --> 00:04:49,581
Are you saying my acting is bad?

38
00:04:52,302 --> 00:04:53,585
- Uh-oh!
- Hey!

39
00:04:54,745 --> 00:04:55,670
Stop!

40
00:04:56,644 --> 00:04:57,464
Hey!

41
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,051
Haa...

42
00:05:01,472 --> 00:05:02,344
Even so,

43
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:03,539
peeling someone's face

44
00:05:03,563 --> 00:05:04,906
while they're alive,

45
00:05:05,088 --> 00:05:08,391
raping and dismembering their corpse.

46
00:05:09,111 --> 00:05:11,311
Seriously, it's in poor taste.

47
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,647
It's all good.

48
00:05:14,913 --> 00:05:16,281
That's what Grand Guignol

49
00:05:16,305 --> 00:05:17,445
is all about, you see.

Someone you know?

53
00:05:39,925 --> 00:05:41,299
I don't know...

54
00:05:42,887 --> 00:05:44,177
Um...

55
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,929
Sorry,

56
00:05:47,807 --> 00:05:49,474
it seems like I got lost.

57
00:05:49,717 --> 00:05:51,184
Lost?

58
00:05:51,825 --> 00:05:53,436
What?

59
00:05:53,491 --> 00:05:54,646
Are you a transfer student?

60
00:05:54,825 --> 00:05:55,647
Yes.

61
00:05:56,487 --> 00:05:57,440
Um...

62
00:05:57,988 --> 00:05:59,192
Nice to meet you.

65

Yes.

66
00:06:08,508 --> 00:06:09,734
It's a term for a style of

67
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,804
gruesome theater that

68
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:11,842
was popular in France

69
00:06:11,867 --> 00:06:12,867
from the late 19th to

70
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:14,579
early 20th centuries.

71
00:06:14,676 --> 00:06:16,126
It has extensive use of gimmicks

72
00:06:16,151 --> 00:06:17,648
and explores the darker aspects

73
00:06:17,672 --> 00:06:18,780
of the human psyche.

74
00:06:18,804 --> 00:06:19,937
It is characterized by

75
00:06:19,953 --> 00:06:21,633
the "grotesque" drama.

76
00:06:21,866 --> 00:06:23,216
I see.

77
00:06:25,849 --> 00:06:28,221
We, the Grand Guignol Study Club,

78
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,849
have the goal of studying and

79
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:31,526
practicing this form of theater.

80
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,817
We engage in discussions

81
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,229
and activities every day.

82
00:06:34,253 --> 00:06:35,812
We write down conclusions, but...

83
00:06:36,788 --> 00:06:37,772
But?

84
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:39,897
Sometimes, the line between

85
00:06:39,913 --> 00:06:41,529
reality and our world blurs.

86
00:06:42,055 --> 00:06:43,475
We wonder which one

87
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,233
is the real world for us.

88
00:06:45,632 --> 00:06:47,699
You're overthinking it, chief.

89
00:06:47,761 --> 00:06:50,452
You're just really dedicated to theater.

90
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:51,453
Right.

91
00:06:51,554 --> 00:06:53,193
I mean, everyone's gone home

92
00:06:53,225 --> 00:06:54,955
for summer break,

93
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,917
but he's still here practicing.

94
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,428
We don't have a home to go back to.

95
00:06:59,671 --> 00:07:00,420
Huh?

96
00:07:00,983 --> 00:07:02,881
Even if we went home,

97
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:04,905
no one would welcome us.

98
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:08,094
Because we're that kind of people.

99
00:07:09,507 --> 00:07:11,097
So, what about you?

100
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,724
What did you do 'over there'?

101
00:07:13,076 --> 00:07:14,142
What do you mean?

102
00:07:14,251 --> 00:07:15,506
Coming here means

103
00:07:15,531 --> 00:07:17,609
you caused some kind of trouble, right?

104
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:20,022
No, I didn't do anything.

105
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,608
Don't lie.

106
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,046
This place is

107
00:07:23,046 --> 00:07:24,304
a secluded island,

108
00:07:24,329 --> 00:07:26,007
cut off from the world with no means

109
00:07:26,023 --> 00:07:27,157
of contact with society

110
00:07:27,181 --> 00:07:29,181
and no means of receiving information.

111
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,368
Unless your parents have abandoned you,

112
00:07:31,392 --> 00:07:32,499
you can't transfer

113
00:07:32,515 --> 00:07:33,697
to a school like this.

114
00:07:33,721 --> 00:07:35,777
No, I didn't...

115
00:08:01,553 --> 00:08:03,066
Is something wrong?

116
00:08:08,386 --> 00:08:09,489
No,

117
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,341
it's nothing.

118
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:27,224
Christoph Private Conservatory,

119
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,107
Rule 8 of Student Conduct,

120
00:08:29,835 --> 00:08:31,671
students' conscientiousness is about

121
00:08:32,296 --> 00:08:34,472
adhering rigorously to set schedules

122
00:08:34,496 --> 00:08:36,294
and acting five minutes in advance

123
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:37,802
are expected behaviors here.

124
00:08:39,145 --> 00:08:40,919
You're quite behind the schedule.

125
00:08:43,258 --> 00:08:44,858
What does this mean?

126
00:08:45,877 --> 00:08:47,152
Well,

127
00:08:47,237 --> 00:08:48,236
you see,

128
00:08:48,924 --> 00:08:52,073
I got lost on the way from the port.

129
00:08:55,599 --> 00:08:57,188
The map with clear instructions

130
00:08:57,213 --> 00:08:58,720
should have been provided.

131
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,859
It also clearly stated that you should

132
00:09:00,868 --> 00:09:01,953
come promptly after

133
00:09:01,978 --> 00:09:03,149
getting off the boat.

134
00:09:05,998 --> 00:09:07,839
Did you take a detour?

135
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:10,425
I'm sorry.

136
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:14,554
Please be more careful in the future.

137
00:09:15,685 --> 00:09:16,522
Yes.

138
00:09:18,537 --> 00:09:19,392
So,

139
00:09:21,439 --> 00:09:23,188
looking at this lot,

140
00:09:24,305 --> 00:09:26,048
did Homura-kun join

141
00:09:26,056 --> 00:09:28,656
the Grand Guignol Study Club too?

142
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,695
Huh? Join?

143
00:09:31,641 --> 00:09:32,655
What do you mean?

144
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,023
No, well...

145
00:09:34,313 --> 00:09:35,325
You see...

146
00:09:35,349 --> 00:09:38,119
They are short on members, it seems.

147
00:09:39,124 --> 00:09:40,751
If you have nothing else to do

148
00:09:40,775 --> 00:09:42,032
until school starts,

149
00:09:42,787 --> 00:09:44,831
why not join since you're here?

150
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:46,961
Umm...

151
00:09:47,576 --> 00:09:48,755
Yes...

152
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:50,507
Huh? Really?

153
00:09:51,303 --> 00:09:52,300
Well,

154
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,199
if it's alright with you.

155
00:09:55,359 --> 00:09:56,829
Then, today we'll have a welcome party!

156
00:09:56,931 --> 00:09:58,515
Teacher, is it okay?

157
00:09:59,226 --> 00:10:00,350
It's fine.

158
00:10:00,764 --> 00:10:02,102
Yay!

159
00:10:02,126 --> 00:10:04,270
Let Minakami-san know.

160
00:10:04,982 --> 00:10:05,939
And...

161
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:11,069
tell Hiruko-kun to behave himself.

162
00:10:11,858 --> 00:10:13,174
He seems to think pranks

163
00:10:13,199 --> 00:10:15,132
are a form of communication.

164
00:10:15,464 --> 00:10:16,533
Understood.

165
00:10:18,247 --> 00:10:19,290
Welcome.

166
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:21,871
Yes.

167
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,502
Um, teacher,

168
00:10:27,588 --> 00:10:29,062
about Hideto,

169
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:30,101
if we can't find him,

170
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,548
maybe we should inform the police?

171
00:10:31,572 --> 00:10:33,188
If we were to contact the police

172
00:10:33,204 --> 00:10:34,266
every time he ran away,

173
00:10:34,282 --> 00:10:35,859
it would be quite a nuisance.

174
00:10:35,883 --> 00:10:37,595
I understand, but...

175
00:10:39,578 --> 00:10:40,727
You don't want to turn this

176
00:10:40,735 --> 00:10:41,867
into a big problem, yes?

177
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:43,858
If it turns out to be

178
00:10:43,883 --> 00:10:45,078
an accident during the camp,

179
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:48,469
all of you, including you three,

180
00:10:48,494 --> 00:10:50,336
will be held responsible.

181
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:51,860
Even me?

182
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,238
Of course.

183
00:10:55,902 --> 00:10:57,027
Especially Bato-kun,

184
00:10:57,052 --> 00:10:58,425
you're the club president.

185
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:00,863
If you don't want to be held

186
00:11:00,888 --> 00:11:01,949
responsible for this,

187
00:11:01,974 --> 00:11:03,145
then find him quickly.

188
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:05,582
Oh man...

189
00:11:06,926 --> 00:11:07,719
Well,

190
00:11:08,032 --> 00:11:09,335
in any case,

191
00:11:09,882 --> 00:11:12,380
he'll probably come back soon.

192
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,100
Nice to meet you.

193
00:11:24,623 --> 00:11:26,260
I'm the head chef of this academy,

194
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:27,253
Minakami.

195
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,022
Hello.

196
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,494
What is it?

197
00:11:51,918 --> 00:11:53,746
There's a stain on your collar,

198
00:11:55,196 --> 00:11:56,758
looks like someone spilled something.

199
00:11:58,053 --> 00:11:58,927
No.

200
00:11:59,828 --> 00:12:00,762
Umm...

201
00:12:04,283 --> 00:12:05,808
I wonder what kind of stain this is.

202
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:10,438
This sweet and sour scent.

203
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:11,981
No.

204
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,485
Umm...

205
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,950
I wonder what kind of sauce this is.

206
00:12:24,664 --> 00:12:25,745
You're quite sloppy.

207
00:12:26,566 --> 00:12:28,581
Pay more attention to your appearance.

208
00:12:31,923 --> 00:12:32,799
Yes.

209
00:12:37,454 --> 00:12:38,860
The dorms are divided into.

210
00:12:38,885 --> 00:12:39,977
A and B buildings.

211
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:41,868
I, the president, and.

212
00:12:41,893 --> 00:12:43,657
Senior Amagami are in A building.

213
00:12:45,074 --> 00:12:46,102
Senior Teshio and.

214
00:12:46,118 --> 00:12:47,750
Senior Itsuki are in B building.

215
00:12:49,411 --> 00:12:51,271
Thanks for letting me know.

216
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,816
B building...

217
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:56,827
There are some strange rumors about it.

218
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:02,699
At night,

219
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,531
you can hear barefoot footsteps

220
00:13:05,556 --> 00:13:06,756
in the hallway.

221
00:13:08,344 --> 00:13:09,247
Thump,

222
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,165
thump,

223
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:13,501
thump.

224
00:13:14,911 --> 00:13:15,670
What?

225
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:18,298
Just kidding.

226
00:13:20,053 --> 00:13:21,676
Don't scare me.

227
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:23,668
But you should be careful.

228
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,840
Seniors might become the target.

229
00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:28,016
Huh?

230
00:13:29,224 --> 00:13:30,810
It's strange for me to say this, but...

231
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,276
Seniors...

232
00:13:38,674 --> 00:13:40,361
they smell so delicious.

233
00:13:41,794 --> 00:13:43,114
Oww!

234
00:13:46,254 --> 00:13:48,494
Well then, I'll see you later.

235
00:13:49,096 --> 00:13:50,413
Ah! Wait!

236
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,124
Hiru,

237
00:13:53,445 --> 00:13:54,709
why are you here?

238
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:59,422
I played a prank on my parents.

239
00:14:00,494 --> 00:14:01,254
Huh?

240
00:14:02,581 --> 00:14:03,426
Ma...

241
00:14:04,066 --> 00:14:05,887
On my mother's birthday,

242
00:14:06,723 --> 00:14:08,931
I put explosives in her cake.

243
00:14:10,406 --> 00:14:11,642
And then...

244
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:14,312
- Boom!
- Whoa!

245
00:15:27,075 --> 00:15:28,719
Nice to meet you all.

246
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,519
Now then, Homura-kun,

247
00:15:37,012 --> 00:15:38,896
if you have any questions,

248
00:15:38,944 --> 00:15:41,399
don't hesitate to ask everyone.

249
00:15:42,257 --> 00:15:43,234
Alright?

250
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:45,236
Yes.

251
00:15:51,173 --> 00:15:53,327
I can teach you if you want.

252
00:15:53,632 --> 00:15:54,370
Huh?

253
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,538
Hiru, no.

254
00:15:55,593 --> 00:15:57,039
You only talk nonsense.

255
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,068
That's not true at all!

256
00:15:59,068 --> 00:16:00,507
With Itsuki joining us,

257
00:16:00,532 --> 00:16:01,735
the Grand Guignol Study Club

258
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,977
is going to be even livelier.

259
00:16:03,001 --> 00:16:04,746
I hope it'll be more enjoyable.

260
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,140
Now, there's one more thing for today.

261
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:18,436
Besides the transfer student Homura-kun,

262
00:16:19,551 --> 00:16:23,357
we have a new teacher joining us.

263
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:31,073
Come in.

264
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,759
Hello.

265
00:16:50,001 --> 00:16:51,427
I'm Otomo Rino.

266
00:16:51,937 --> 00:16:53,804
I'll be in your care.

267
00:18:30,853 --> 00:18:32,236
Would you believe me.

268
00:18:33,327 --> 00:18:34,260
What?

269
00:18:36,455 --> 00:18:37,658
What's joining a club like?

270
00:18:37,682 --> 00:18:39,165
I've never joined any club before,

271
00:18:39,197 --> 00:18:40,578
this is my first time.

272
00:18:40,602 --> 00:18:41,996
No, wait.

273
00:18:51,932 --> 00:18:52,798
Huh?

274
00:18:53,668 --> 00:18:54,972
That outfit...

275
00:18:56,186 --> 00:18:57,011
What do you think?

276
00:18:57,557 --> 00:18:58,554
Does it suit me?

277
00:19:05,495 --> 00:19:07,131
Do you dislike this kind of thing?

278
00:19:07,448 --> 00:19:08,981
I don't have a preference,

279
00:19:09,285 --> 00:19:10,107
but...

280
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,901
it's just that Amagami-kun...

281
00:19:12,096 --> 00:19:13,694
Please don't look at me like that.

282
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:21,952
Hey,

283
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:24,121
want to try wearing it, too?

284
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:25,111
Huh?

285
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:26,624
No,

286
00:19:26,788 --> 00:19:28,248
I don't really have an interest

287
00:19:28,273 --> 00:19:29,366
in that sort of thing.

288
00:19:29,405 --> 00:19:30,795
Come on, don't say that.

289
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,090
You might actually like it.

290
00:19:39,151 --> 00:19:40,304
Head chef!

291
00:19:41,004 --> 00:19:41,764
Huh?

292
00:19:53,945 --> 00:19:55,653
What's with this?

293
00:19:59,768 --> 00:20:00,825
This...

294
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,167
It's your doing again?

295
00:20:10,568 --> 00:20:11,752
You little...!

296
00:20:12,096 --> 00:20:12,962
Hey!

297
00:20:13,275 --> 00:20:15,089
Hey! Stop!

298
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,842
Hiru, hey!

299
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,073
Hiru!

300
00:21:27,715 --> 00:21:30,164
I told you not to show it on your face,

301
00:21:32,428 --> 00:21:34,376
but what was that look of pleasure?

302
00:21:35,522 --> 00:21:36,796
I'm sorry.

303
00:21:37,563 --> 00:21:38,672
I...

304
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:12,998
Hey,

305
00:22:13,717 --> 00:22:14,917
Minakami-san.

306
00:22:16,383 --> 00:22:17,294
What?

307
00:22:19,866 --> 00:22:21,382
About Itsuki...

308
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:23,759
What are you going to do with him?

309
00:22:35,566 --> 00:22:37,106
Are you jealous?

310
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:40,734
No.

311
00:22:41,205 --> 00:22:42,528
That's not it.

312
00:22:42,855 --> 00:22:43,904
But that's okay.

313
00:22:45,118 --> 00:22:46,866
That's why I'm like this.

314
00:22:49,831 --> 00:22:51,996
It feels especially good.

315
00:24:27,173 --> 00:24:28,467
Hmm?

316
00:24:29,498 --> 00:24:31,345
Is he trying to tempt me?

317
00:25:41,946 --> 00:25:42,750
Ah.

318
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:12,488
Dammit!

319
00:26:27,416 --> 00:26:28,295
Hey.

320
00:26:30,223 --> 00:26:30,923
Hey!

321
00:27:02,275 --> 00:27:03,122
Hey.

322
00:27:04,403 --> 00:27:05,457
Hey, it's your turn.

323
00:27:06,134 --> 00:27:06,917
Huh?

324
00:27:08,129 --> 00:27:09,297
Hurry up.

325
00:28:43,908 --> 00:28:44,973
What happened?

326
00:28:45,297 --> 00:28:46,808
About that...

327
00:28:53,485 --> 00:28:54,232
Hey.

328
00:28:54,674 --> 00:28:55,755
Hey, are you alright?

329
00:28:55,779 --> 00:28:56,568
Hey!

330
00:29:26,448 --> 00:29:28,100
Oh, it's you, Nikishi.

331
00:29:30,715 --> 00:29:31,436
Hey.

332
00:29:31,719 --> 00:29:32,729
What's going on?

333
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:40,100
Head...

334
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,280
Head.

335
00:29:42,551 --> 00:29:43,532
Head?

336
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:15,981
This phone is no good either.

337
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,734
I can't hear anything.

338
00:30:20,417 --> 00:30:21,877
It feels like

339
00:30:22,205 --> 00:30:25,324
it might be disconnected from the base.

340
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:28,493
Teacher,

341
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,919
I recall there being a radiotelephone

342
00:30:30,928 --> 00:30:32,661
for emergency situations.

343
00:30:33,892 --> 00:30:35,500
That radiotelephone

344
00:30:35,555 --> 00:30:36,877
was destroyed.

345
00:30:39,549 --> 00:30:41,131
There's no way of fixing.

346
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,467
Who on earth...?

347
00:30:44,486 --> 00:30:46,595
This island is isolated from the world,

348
00:30:46,962 --> 00:30:49,723
with no means of contact with society

349
00:30:50,199 --> 00:30:52,392
and no means of receiving information.

350
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:54,824
Hey,

351
00:30:55,416 --> 00:30:56,476
what about the island's

352
00:30:56,501 --> 00:30:57,481
regular deliveries?

353
00:30:57,506 --> 00:30:59,059
Once every two days.

354
00:31:01,122 --> 00:31:02,194
So,

355
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:04,863
if they don't come tomorrow,

356
00:31:05,847 --> 00:31:07,074
help won't arrive then.

357
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,118
Is there any plan, perhaps?

358
00:31:10,509 --> 00:31:12,287
We'll think of that now.

359
00:31:12,311 --> 00:31:13,622
There's no need for that.

360
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,189
Once we catch the culprit,

361
00:31:20,205 --> 00:31:21,251
it'll be over.

362
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,257
Right,

363
00:31:25,769 --> 00:31:27,219
Homura Itsuki-kun?

364
00:31:28,618 --> 00:31:29,368
Huh?

365
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:32,182
Me?

366
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:34,393
Why?

367
00:31:40,237 --> 00:31:41,900
It was lying in that storeroom.

368
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,154
Minakami-san

369
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,366
seemed to have taken a liking to you.

370
00:31:53,133 --> 00:31:54,806
You said suggestive things

371
00:31:54,958 --> 00:31:56,873
to lure Minakami-san.

372
00:31:58,667 --> 00:31:59,709
That's not...

373
00:32:03,293 --> 00:32:04,211
If that's the case,

374
00:32:04,428 --> 00:32:06,428
it could be Teacher Otomo too!

375
00:32:06,866 --> 00:32:07,801
Me?

376
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:08,844
Yes, you!

377
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,209
You're not at all disturbed by the fact

378
00:32:11,234 --> 00:32:13,220
that someone was brutally murdered,

379
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,183
and besides, how did you

380
00:32:15,496 --> 00:32:17,394
even get to this island?

381
00:32:17,581 --> 00:32:18,896
I got on the same boat as you.

382
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:20,105
That's a lie!

383
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:22,566
You weren't there.

384
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,067
Everyone, please calm down!

385
00:32:26,958 --> 00:32:27,997
The first rule of the.

386
00:32:28,013 --> 00:32:29,629
Christoph Private Conservatory's

387
00:32:29,646 --> 00:32:30,607
code of conduct,

388
00:32:30,632 --> 00:32:32,069
students' conscientiousness

389
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,036
is to trust and help each other.

390
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,041
In situations like this,

391
00:32:40,534 --> 00:32:42,043
we need to stick together

392
00:32:42,067 --> 00:32:43,128
for safety.

393
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,504
I refuse.

394
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,264
There's no assurance

395
00:32:48,289 --> 00:32:49,969
that this place is safe,

396
00:32:50,311 --> 00:32:51,470
and besides,

397
00:32:51,633 --> 00:32:53,597
no one can be trusted.

398
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:56,016
It's just me.

399
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:57,434
The rest of you,

400
00:32:58,018 --> 00:32:59,415
feel free to do as you like.

401
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:03,690
That's true.

402
00:33:04,339 --> 00:33:06,234
There's no point in cowering here.

403
00:33:06,969 --> 00:33:07,903
Got it.

404
00:33:08,859 --> 00:33:09,867
If that's the case,

405
00:33:09,892 --> 00:33:12,559
I'll catch the culprit no matter what.

406
00:33:12,764 --> 00:33:13,807
Nikishi-san,

407
00:33:14,695 --> 00:33:16,037
keep an eye on everyone,

408
00:33:16,062 --> 00:33:18,085
ensure they don't do anything reckless.

409
00:33:21,985 --> 00:33:23,688
I'll try to find out if there's any way

410
00:33:23,696 --> 00:33:24,827
to establish contact

411
00:33:24,851 --> 00:33:26,379
with the outside world.

412
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,510
Excuse me.

413
00:33:32,982 --> 00:33:33,929
Wait!

414
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:35,305
What?

415
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,099
Return...

416
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:41,561
Return my Minakami-san!

417
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:42,938
Stop it already!

418
00:33:44,066 --> 00:33:46,024
I'm a victim too!

419
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:48,443
I am also...

420
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,735
I am also caught up in this!

421
00:34:40,114 --> 00:34:42,247
Let's not be alone.

422
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,380
What were you thinking about?

423
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:57,762
What's happening?

424
00:34:57,817 --> 00:34:59,389
I have no idea what's happening.

425
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,933
I'm starting to wonder

426
00:35:02,449 --> 00:35:04,519
if maybe I'm being targeted.

427
00:35:13,573 --> 00:35:15,071
Why do you think that?

428
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,407
Well...

429
00:35:38,633 --> 00:35:39,596
It's okay.

430
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:42,474
I understand everything.

431
00:35:45,657 --> 00:35:47,228
Don't worry.

432
00:35:49,945 --> 00:35:51,191
I just...

433
00:35:52,361 --> 00:35:54,319
I only followed orders...

434
00:35:57,246 --> 00:35:58,498
I had no choice

435
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,661
but to do it...

436
00:36:27,683 --> 00:36:30,271
Hey, who made this?

437
00:36:31,984 --> 00:36:33,817
Don't eat it if you don't want to.

438
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,363
I will eat it.

439
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:44,619
Come on, you too.

440
00:36:44,984 --> 00:36:46,433
I don't want it.

441
00:36:46,789 --> 00:36:48,665
What? Keeping it to yourself?

442
00:36:50,987 --> 00:36:51,751
Hey.

443
00:36:51,775 --> 00:36:53,294
Huh? What's going on?

444
00:37:01,003 --> 00:37:02,345
Teacher Rino

445
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,805
hasn't returned yet.

446
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:06,474
Teacher Yukimi, too.

447
00:37:07,286 --> 00:37:08,351
Could it be that

448
00:37:08,398 --> 00:37:10,398
we won't have electricity?

449
00:37:16,002 --> 00:37:17,193
Don't worry.

450
00:37:17,724 --> 00:37:18,778
I'll go and check it out.

451
00:37:19,284 --> 00:37:20,864
That's some sense of justice,

452
00:37:20,888 --> 00:37:22,907
President, but be careful.

453
00:37:25,121 --> 00:37:26,411
Amagami, are you coming too?

454
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,454
Huh?

455
00:37:27,562 --> 00:37:28,455
Me?

456
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:31,374
No, I mean, I...

457
00:37:31,796 --> 00:37:32,834
It's alright.

458
00:37:35,965 --> 00:37:37,255
No need to force yourself.

459
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:40,383
I'll go instead.

460
00:37:44,663 --> 00:37:45,597
I got it.

461
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,063
And you?

462
00:37:55,066 --> 00:37:56,566
I'll pass.

463
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:02,489
I...

464
00:38:02,715 --> 00:38:03,948
I'll stay behind.

465
00:38:04,769 --> 00:38:06,826
The teachers might come back.

466
00:38:11,769 --> 00:38:12,624
Let's go.

467
00:38:12,788 --> 00:38:13,541
Yeah.

468
00:38:15,343 --> 00:38:16,265
Thank you.

469
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:18,590
Wait.

470
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:21,335
What?

471
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:31,726
I...

472
00:38:32,422 --> 00:38:33,269
I'll go too.

473
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:35,897
Amagami.

474
00:38:36,841 --> 00:38:38,390
There's no guarantee of safety

475
00:38:38,414 --> 00:38:39,454
staying here.

476
00:38:41,905 --> 00:38:42,946
Let's go.

477
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,283
Alright!

478
00:38:47,838 --> 00:38:48,785
Yeah.

479
00:38:52,434 --> 00:38:53,498
Wait!

480
00:38:53,982 --> 00:38:55,333
Wait for me!

481
00:39:37,914 --> 00:39:39,679
The distribution panel is at the back.

482
00:39:42,301 --> 00:39:43,256
Let's go.

483
00:40:05,414 --> 00:40:07,238
I'm also scared as well.

484
00:40:09,963 --> 00:40:10,950
Let's go.

485
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:36,766
Are you alright?

486
00:40:40,988 --> 00:40:41,895
Please get up.

487
00:40:51,437 --> 00:40:52,575
It's alright.

488
00:40:53,247 --> 00:40:54,452
Don't worry anymore.

489
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:58,957
Just wait here.

490
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:01,209
Please look after Hiruko.

491
00:41:23,268 --> 00:41:24,107
President...

492
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:25,525
Yeah.

493
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:29,487
Let's keep going.

494
00:42:24,762 --> 00:42:25,996
Run!

495
00:43:55,624 --> 00:43:56,843
Teshio...

496
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:58,344
Please help me...

497
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,768
Good evening,

498
00:44:08,305 --> 00:44:10,314
lovely moon tonight.

499
00:44:15,351 --> 00:44:16,612
Since I'm here,

500
00:44:16,964 --> 00:44:18,990
why not let me join too?

501
00:44:19,825 --> 00:44:21,075
Teshio...

502
00:44:30,248 --> 00:44:32,253
President's flesh sure looks delicious.

503
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,633
My pet dog loves meat, you know.

504
00:44:38,073 --> 00:44:39,010
Once,

505
00:44:39,226 --> 00:44:40,268
I even gave him

506
00:44:40,293 --> 00:44:41,973
my father's index finger.

507
00:44:42,764 --> 00:44:44,640
I'm sure he'd love your taste, too.

508
00:44:45,876 --> 00:44:46,809
You...

509
00:44:51,898 --> 00:44:53,024
You know,

510
00:44:53,592 --> 00:44:55,776
I've always disliked you.

511
00:45:03,408 --> 00:45:04,202
Hey,

512
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:05,870
let's perform harakiri.

513
00:45:06,081 --> 00:45:07,158
You mentioned it during

514
00:45:07,175 --> 00:45:08,207
the club meetings.

515
00:45:08,231 --> 00:45:09,707
Let's do it now, shall we?

516
00:45:13,549 --> 00:45:14,712
You've got to be kidding me!

517
00:45:39,495 --> 00:45:40,988
Beautiful.

518
00:47:01,924 --> 00:47:04,905
Then, senior Teshio... President?

519
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:06,574
He's gone mad!

520
00:47:13,667 --> 00:47:14,582
This is...

521
00:47:15,152 --> 00:47:16,333
Which one is it?

522
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:18,711
Huh?

523
00:47:20,815 --> 00:47:22,298
Grand Guignol.

524
00:47:25,947 --> 00:47:27,166
The boundary between reality

525
00:47:27,182 --> 00:47:28,222
and fantasy,

526
00:47:28,314 --> 00:47:29,541
we can't differentiate it.

527
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:32,016
For us,

528
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,500
we can't tell which is the real world.

529
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:37,063
What the hell is going on?

530
00:47:39,666 --> 00:47:41,485
Hey, instead of that,

531
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:43,043
who is the masked person?

532
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:44,612
Who is it?

533
00:47:44,681 --> 00:47:46,113
Probably a man, right?

534
00:47:46,598 --> 00:47:48,080
They managed to decapitate President

535
00:47:48,104 --> 00:47:49,158
with a single strike.

536
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,494
A man...

537
00:47:52,745 --> 00:47:54,914
- Come to think of it, Nikishi...
- But we don't know.

538
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:58,071
Even a woman, with enough training,

539
00:47:58,096 --> 00:47:59,190
could pull it off.

540
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:01,506
The possibilities

541
00:48:01,546 --> 00:48:02,671
are limitless!

542
00:48:22,592 --> 00:48:23,859
Relax,

543
00:48:23,999 --> 00:48:25,149
it's me.

544
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:38,499
What?

545
00:48:39,067 --> 00:48:42,044
Do you suspect me, by any chance?

546
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:47,550
There's no reason to trust someone

547
00:48:47,823 --> 00:48:49,301
regardless of who they are.

548
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:52,388
Right.

549
00:48:52,755 --> 00:48:54,557
Well, if that's how it is.

550
00:48:55,275 --> 00:48:56,350
But more importantly,

551
00:48:56,491 --> 00:48:58,254
anything on this island that

552
00:48:58,279 --> 00:49:00,012
could be used as a weapon?

553
00:49:00,722 --> 00:49:01,730
Teacher,

554
00:49:02,679 --> 00:49:04,055
are you planning to fight them?

555
00:49:05,448 --> 00:49:06,930
If we just wait until today is over,

556
00:49:06,955 --> 00:49:08,571
a ship will come tomorrow.

557
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:11,490
People sometimes

558
00:49:11,974 --> 00:49:13,683
find themselves in situations where

559
00:49:13,708 --> 00:49:15,472
they have no choice but to fight.

560
00:49:16,162 --> 00:49:17,413
In my case,

561
00:49:18,465 --> 00:49:19,582
that time is now.

562
00:49:24,491 --> 00:49:25,384
Teacher,

563
00:49:25,409 --> 00:49:26,449
if it's a rifle, in the

564
00:49:26,474 --> 00:49:27,476
principal's office locker...

565
00:49:27,501 --> 00:49:28,693
Why are you telling her that?

566
00:49:28,718 --> 00:49:29,612
Because...

567
00:49:30,205 --> 00:49:31,281
Thank you...

568
00:49:32,485 --> 00:49:34,096
for believing in me.

569
00:49:38,974 --> 00:49:39,935
Teacher!

570
00:49:42,178 --> 00:49:43,606
I'll be fine.

571
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:44,935
But more importantly,

572
00:49:44,951 --> 00:49:46,817
take care of your own lives.

573
00:49:47,101 --> 00:49:47,943
Listen,

574
00:49:48,209 --> 00:49:50,654
please don't act alone.

575
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:19,975
What happened earlier,

576
00:50:20,179 --> 00:50:21,143
I'm sorry.

577
00:50:22,643 --> 00:50:25,231
I misunderstood Itsuki.

578
00:50:26,169 --> 00:50:27,089
It's okay.

579
00:50:27,386 --> 00:50:28,567
It's hard

580
00:50:30,246 --> 00:50:31,904
not to lose control

581
00:50:32,365 --> 00:50:33,614
in a situation like this.

582
00:50:35,846 --> 00:50:37,201
It's not normal.

583
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:40,204
We might die.

584
00:50:41,518 --> 00:50:43,082
You shouldn't be weak.

585
00:50:44,301 --> 00:50:45,251
It's alright.

586
00:50:45,918 --> 00:50:47,586
We'll be fine.

587
00:50:48,109 --> 00:50:49,338
I promise.

588
00:50:51,912 --> 00:50:53,008
Alright.

589
00:50:56,747 --> 00:50:58,264
Don't forget

590
00:50:59,786 --> 00:51:01,245
that promise.

591
00:51:06,186 --> 00:51:07,022
Wait...!

592
00:51:12,683 --> 00:51:14,392
Everyone...

593
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,949
That's Teacher Takenomiya!

594
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:18,492
Hiru, wake up!

595
00:51:32,527 --> 00:51:35,384
Run away!

596
00:51:35,655 --> 00:51:36,885
Teacher!

597
00:52:20,621 --> 00:52:22,389
Let's get out of here!

598
00:53:04,966 --> 00:53:07,588
Hey, Hiru! What are you doing? Hurry up!

599
00:53:09,254 --> 00:53:10,187
Hiru!

600
00:53:12,805 --> 00:53:13,774
What happened?

601
00:53:13,798 --> 00:53:14,733
Hiru, he...!

602
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:25,179
No.

603
00:53:29,738 --> 00:53:30,999
Itsuki!

604
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:56,650
Hiruko.

605
00:54:49,813 --> 00:54:51,455
You’re safe, Homura-kun!

606
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:55,626
Teacher...

607
00:54:59,046 --> 00:55:00,714
What’s going on here?

608
00:55:01,136 --> 00:55:02,633
You know something, right?

609
00:55:03,038 --> 00:55:05,385
Hey! What on earth is going on?

610
00:55:06,288 --> 00:55:07,304
Homura-kun,

611
00:55:07,577 --> 00:55:08,430
listen.

612
00:55:08,609 --> 00:55:10,057
Calm down and listen.

613
00:55:11,685 --> 00:55:13,101
Actually, I...

614
00:55:14,139 --> 00:55:15,270
came here...

615
00:55:15,793 --> 00:55:18,023
I came to kill that masked demon.

616
00:55:21,441 --> 00:55:23,116
It's a dreaded tradition passed down

617
00:55:23,133 --> 00:55:24,769
through generations in this academy.

618
00:55:24,793 --> 00:55:25,776
It is the

619
00:55:25,995 --> 00:55:27,593
ancient tradition of worshiping

620
00:55:27,609 --> 00:55:29,296
a malevolent god on this island.

621
00:55:30,238 --> 00:55:31,912
And that mask is

622
00:55:31,942 --> 00:55:33,979
the symbol of that malevolent god.

623
00:55:34,435 --> 00:55:36,262
Every year, it demands the sacrifice

624
00:55:36,287 --> 00:55:38,145
of young boys in a ritual.

625
00:55:40,343 --> 00:55:43,298
My brother went missing

626
00:55:43,638 --> 00:55:46,718
shortly after enrolling in this academy.

627
00:55:47,378 --> 00:55:49,555
As I delved into the truth behind it,

628
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:51,807
I discovered this place.

629
00:55:53,270 --> 00:55:55,143
I became a teacher here

630
00:55:55,475 --> 00:55:57,604
to infiltrate this island.

631
00:55:58,582 --> 00:55:59,481
And

632
00:55:59,699 --> 00:56:01,441
as I expected,

633
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:02,527
this year is the

634
00:56:02,543 --> 00:56:04,610
once-in-a-decade grand festival.

635
00:56:04,992 --> 00:56:06,003
Under the watchful eyes

636
00:56:06,012 --> 00:56:07,137
of the believers,

637
00:56:07,161 --> 00:56:08,949
in order to awaken the god,

638
00:56:09,105 --> 00:56:11,201
a massive ritual will be held.

639
00:56:11,994 --> 00:56:13,287
Believers?

640
00:56:13,829 --> 00:56:16,248
Where are they?

641
00:56:17,242 --> 00:56:18,706
All over the island,

642
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:20,670
there are cameras installed.

643
00:56:22,421 --> 00:56:24,464
Everything happening here

644
00:56:24,488 --> 00:56:28,051
is broadcasted worldwide via satellites.

645
00:56:28,868 --> 00:56:30,053
In a sense,

646
00:56:30,676 --> 00:56:31,555
this is...

647
00:56:31,803 --> 00:56:32,769
a slaughter show,

648
00:56:32,785 --> 00:56:34,277
done in the name of the god.

649
00:56:35,061 --> 00:56:36,393
A slaughter show...

650
00:56:37,269 --> 00:56:39,043
If you don't defeat them,

651
00:56:39,152 --> 00:56:41,315
you'll end up like my brother,

652
00:56:42,176 --> 00:56:43,984
becoming a sacrifice for sure.

653
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:45,611
No...

654
00:56:45,635 --> 00:56:46,820
I beg you,

655
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:49,250
won't you fight with me?

656
00:56:50,213 --> 00:56:51,548
It's impossible

657
00:56:51,806 --> 00:56:54,628
to fight against murderers like them.

658
00:56:54,970 --> 00:56:56,455
It's just impossible.

659
00:56:56,867 --> 00:56:58,498
It's obvious, isn't it?

660
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:02,294
I see...

661
00:57:02,732 --> 00:57:03,837
I understand.

662
00:57:08,767 --> 00:57:10,344
Hold onto this.

663
00:57:10,852 --> 00:57:11,710
Huh?

664
00:57:11,905 --> 00:57:14,181
I believe that it will prove useful.

665
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:15,986
But...

666
00:57:18,036 --> 00:57:19,283
even if I hold it,

667
00:57:19,299 --> 00:57:20,626
I won't be able to use it.

668
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:22,731
You're misunderstanding something.

669
00:57:24,029 --> 00:57:26,026
Your real enemy

670
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,153
is yourself.

671
00:58:56,697 --> 00:58:57,909
No way...

672
00:59:09,804 --> 00:59:10,922
Teacher.

673
00:59:12,132 --> 00:59:13,175
What's going on?

674
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:15,469
What's happening?

675
00:59:16,967 --> 00:59:19,806
I merely deceived your eyes.

676
00:59:21,487 --> 00:59:24,644
It's the favorite Grand Guignol trick.

677
00:59:28,248 --> 00:59:29,399
So,

678
00:59:30,196 --> 00:59:31,735
that masked figure from earlier was?

679
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:33,759
It was me.

680
00:59:34,642 --> 00:59:35,489
Huh?

681
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:40,535
Teshio-kun.

682
00:59:41,886 --> 00:59:43,872
I've been looking for you.

683
00:59:44,945 --> 00:59:45,957
Alright,

684
00:59:46,237 --> 00:59:47,334
come,

685
00:59:48,394 --> 00:59:50,295
Amagami is waiting.

686
00:59:58,857 --> 00:59:59,721
No.

687
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:24,514
Somebody!

688
01:01:25,046 --> 01:01:27,142
Somebody help!

689
01:01:28,413 --> 01:01:29,811
What the hell is this?

690
01:01:32,108 --> 01:01:33,190
Somebody!

691
01:02:01,431 --> 01:02:03,345
Now let us begin.

692
01:02:03,837 --> 01:02:06,806
With two beautiful lambs.

693
01:02:08,246 --> 01:02:09,100
No.

694
01:02:11,345 --> 01:02:12,354
No.

695
01:02:30,485 --> 01:02:32,916
No!

696
01:02:44,027 --> 01:02:45,095
No!

697
01:02:48,174 --> 01:02:49,516
What's wrong?

698
01:02:50,068 --> 01:02:52,602
No, stop!

699
01:02:52,863 --> 01:02:54,854
Is it that hot?

700
01:02:56,177 --> 01:02:57,482
All right.

701
01:02:57,948 --> 01:02:59,943
I'll undress you this time.

702
01:03:39,676 --> 01:03:41,443
Such a beautiful melody.

703
01:03:54,078 --> 01:03:54,998
Oh.

704
01:03:58,126 --> 01:03:59,085
Teacher,

705
01:04:00,093 --> 01:04:01,546
he got quiet.

706
01:04:04,015 --> 01:04:05,216
Don't worry.

707
01:04:06,758 --> 01:04:07,886
Let's continue.

708
01:06:22,532 --> 01:06:23,521
Leg...

709
01:06:24,267 --> 01:06:26,107
My leg!

710
01:06:45,479 --> 01:06:46,419
Hey,

711
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:49,297
anything you want to say before you die?

712
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:58,556
You are a well-prepared sacrifice.

713
01:06:59,159 --> 01:07:01,184
Even the god will be pleased.

714
01:07:01,862 --> 01:07:02,852
And...

715
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:06,856
your family who abandoned you.

716
01:07:11,531 --> 01:07:13,071
We are...

717
01:07:14,755 --> 01:07:17,700
We're better off dead.

718
01:07:56,307 --> 01:07:57,448
Hey, hey.

719
01:07:58,882 --> 01:08:00,326
Don't you have any shame?

720
01:08:00,978 --> 01:08:03,496
People all over the world are watching.

721
01:08:11,213 --> 01:08:12,213
Now,

722
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:15,091
it's time for you to awaken!

723
01:08:58,497 --> 01:09:00,178
Come on! Quickly!

724
01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:16,038
This sound...

725
01:09:16,038 --> 01:09:16,903
Huh?

726
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:18,988
It's a ship's horn!

727
01:09:19,012 --> 01:09:20,114
Can't you hear it?

728
01:09:20,426 --> 01:09:21,823
A ship is coming!

729
01:09:21,848 --> 01:09:23,369
What are you talking about?

730
01:09:23,385 --> 01:09:24,697
I don't hear anything!

731
01:09:25,084 --> 01:09:26,746
I can hear it.

732
01:09:27,262 --> 01:09:28,498
I can hear it clearly!

733
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:30,792
We can go back...

734
01:09:31,905 --> 01:09:33,031
I can go back...

735
01:09:34,337 --> 01:09:35,802
I'm going back!

736
01:09:35,896 --> 01:09:37,033
Wait! Homura-kun!

737
01:09:37,041 --> 01:09:38,658
It's dangerous to go alone!

738
01:10:40,463 --> 01:10:41,362
Ma...

739
01:10:50,259 --> 01:10:51,372
Mama.

740
01:12:27,091 --> 01:12:28,719
Now, wake up!

741
01:12:28,889 --> 01:12:30,137
Wake up!

742
01:12:50,653 --> 01:12:52,535
It's finally starting.

743
01:13:28,956 --> 01:13:31,041
Good! Very good! That's it!

744
01:13:31,065 --> 01:13:32,909
More! More!

745
01:15:15,319 --> 01:15:16,721
Teshio.

746
01:15:16,784 --> 01:15:18,264
Itsuki.

747
01:16:50,794 --> 01:16:52,149
Did you die?

748
01:18:58,119 --> 01:19:02,491
(Grand Guignol Study Club)

749
01:19:07,089 --> 01:19:08,369
This grudge,

750
01:19:08,986 --> 01:19:11,247
should I leave it unresolved?

751
01:19:12,250 --> 01:19:14,917
Due to your greed,

752
01:19:15,414 --> 01:19:17,544
I have lost everything.

753
01:19:18,254 --> 01:19:21,090
I only did those things out of love.

754
01:19:22,258 --> 01:19:23,676
Please believe me.

755
01:19:24,677 --> 01:19:26,679
I still love you deeply,

756
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:28,722
from the depths of my heart.

757
01:19:29,330 --> 01:19:30,432
If that is the case...

758
01:19:31,142 --> 01:19:33,644
there is only one thing I desire.

759
01:19:36,188 --> 01:19:37,314
Reincarnation.

760
01:19:43,174 --> 01:19:44,863
To a new world.

761
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:54,123
Let us meet in the next life.
