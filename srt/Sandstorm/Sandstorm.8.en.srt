Here you go.

00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,280
Try this.

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:17,550
Come on.

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,390
Thank you.

00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,600
You guys try it, too.

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,320
Thank you.

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,920
I brought the goat milk
straight from the farm.

9
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,000
They are fresh.

10
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:27,760
Come on.

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,000
Try it. Here you go.

Thank you, Mrs. Liu.

13
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,800
Don't call me that.

You can call me that, too.

Thank you, sister-in-law.

00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:39,750
You're welcome.

19
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,710
Which one is Dazhi's bed?

20
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,070
This is Dazhi's bed.

21
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:48,710
Sure.

22
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,520
Oh, my. Why didn't he fold his blanket?

23
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,110
Liu Dazhi, your sister-in-law is here.

24
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,750
Dafu, did you just finish your lecture?

25
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:02,880
Why did you come here?

26
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,310
I came to visit you.

27
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,120
Sit.

28
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,120
She's my relative from my hometown.

29

We know.

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
She's your sister-in-law.

31
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:14,230
Right.

32
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,480
You've lost some weight.

33
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:24,710
Oh, right.

34
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:26,760
Here.

Take off your shoes.

36
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:29,920
What are you doing?

37
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,510
I sewed a pair of soles for you.

38
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:33,400
Try them.

39
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:34,920
Look, they fit well.

40
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,120
Sister-in-law,

41
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,000
I want a pair, too.

42
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,840
Sure. I'll make a pair for you later.

43
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,400
Hey,

44
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,920
you haven't put this one in yet.

45
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:44,870
Come.

46
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,070
You haven't put this in yet. Oh, my.

47
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,150
Why... Why didn't you tell me
you were coming?

48
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,480
My bad.

49
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,200
I wasn't thinking.

50
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,280
Well, I don't have much to do at home.

51
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,400
You've left for a few months,

52
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,560
so I was thinking of checking on you.

53
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,710
When are you leaving?

54
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,430
Oh, right.

55
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,710
I asked the dorm warden just now.

56
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,680
She told me there's a vacancy here.

57
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,080
I'm thinking

58
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,630
of staying here

59
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,960
and working as the warden.

60
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,150
I can also take care of you.

61
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,120
Wait for me here.

62
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,840

63
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,240

What's this?

65
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,560
Well, I have to attend lectures
every day.

66
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,750
I'll get distracted if you're here.

67

00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,240
Okay.

69
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,400
Is 50 yuan enough?

70
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,360
Yes, that's enough.

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,800

00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,920
But the meal is ready.

79
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,510
Can't you go after eating?

Dafu!

00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,920
Dafu. Hey!

83
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,270
Why are you back?

84
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,800
I don't feel like going.

85
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,120
Are you leaving or not?

86
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,720
Stop asking. I'm not leaving.

87
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,870
Since you got back
from the provincial town,

88
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:08,830
you've been holing up here.

89
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,070
Your dad doesn't say anything about it?

90
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,510
He goes to work.

He's busy.

I see.

93
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,120
I'm leaving, then.

94
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,160

00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,150
Why do you keep avoiding me?

108
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,000
I was busy at school.

I finally came back home,

110
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,960
so I stayed at home with my dad.

I...

114
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,600
I'm heading home.

115
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,080
You gave me 20,000 yuan

116
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,430
before I went to college.

117
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,630
I'll pay you back
once I start making money.

118
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,830
Don't go.

119
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,880
What's that supposed to mean?

120
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,320
You...

Dafu,

124
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,080
haven't we agreed on this before?

125
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,320
Once you graduate

126
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:08,960
and start your own family,

127
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,870
I'll come over to babysit your children.

128
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,160
As long as you can
take me away from here,

129
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,680
I'll do anything you ask for.

130
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,350
Sister-in-law,

131
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,750
if you want to leave this place

132
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,350
or go somewhere else,

133
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,200
you can go at any time.

134
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,830
You don't need me to take you.

135
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,110
I'm all alone.

136
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,750
I don't know much.

137
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,280
How will I survive out there all my own?

138
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,320
What about me?

139
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:49,750
I'm not even sure
whether I can stay in the provincial town

140
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,960
after graduation.

141
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,400
How can I take you with me?

142
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,350
You will.

143
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,230
You will, Dafu.

144
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,160
You're good at studying.

145
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:01,830
You're smart.

146
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:02,960
You're not like those men

147
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,680
who always see me...

148
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,040
Let go.

149
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:06,990
Let go.

150
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,200
Sister-in-law,

151
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,630
we shouldn't have come together.

152
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,320
Let's not meet anymore.

153
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,230

Dafu.

155
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,110
Dafu.

156
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:25,920
Stop calling my name.

157
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,710
Dafu, no.

158
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,080
You can't do this to me.

159
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,750
I've been nice to you.

160
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,280
You can't just throw me away

161
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,080
like a rag

162
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,470
- like those men did.
- What are you on about?

163
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,400
Don't talk nasty about me.

164
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,560
You can't do this to me.

165
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,510
No.

166
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,590
- Let go.
- Please take me.

167
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,750
- Stop yelling.
- Please take me.

168
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,320
Stand up.

169
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,710
Stop pretending.

171
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,230
Answer me.

172
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,080
Master.

173
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,510
You're here.

174
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,630
I've added the charcoal.

175
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,960
You finished the work all by yourself.

176
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,870
Come and wash your hands.

177
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,830
I baked you some flatbread.

178
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:01,680
There aren't a lot.

179
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,350
I can finish them myself.

180
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,560
Hello?

181
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,440
Dad.

00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,160
Dafu.

183
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,960
I think I killed someone.

184
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:16,680
What?

185
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,560
Chun.

186
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,320
A second.

187
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,800
Dafu,

188
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,560
was what you said true?

189
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,310
No way.

190
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,270
Dad.

191
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:44,280
Why... Why did you do that?

192
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,640
I don't care.

193
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,640
Please help me.

194
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,480
I don't care. Nobody...

195
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,640
Nobody saw me.

196
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,920
I'll just leave her here.

197
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,400
You can't do that.

198
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:56,080
If the body is found,

199
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:59,240
the police will track it back to you.

200
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:02,710
Stop crying.

201
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:03,710
Don't cry.

202
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:05,920
Let me think.

203
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,470
Stop crying already.

204
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,040
Listen.

205
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:33,790
Now,

206
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,430
find a place

207
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,190
to hide the body.

208
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,070
After twelve,

209
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,950
carry her to the boiler room

210
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,280
and put her into the furnace.

211
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,400
Master, you're back.

212
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,360
The door.

213
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,190
Master, close the door.

214
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,070
Master,

215
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,880
the manager went out.

216
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,310
Before he comes back,

217
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,790
I'll cover for you.

218
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,520
You can go home.

219
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,190
Dafu rarely comes home.

220
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,710
You should spend more time with him.

221
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,320
No need.

222
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,470
He's probably still at the cybercafe.

223
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,560
Wang Liang, since we're free,

224
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,320
let's play the Xiangqi.

225
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:13,990
Again?

226
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,510
You lost three rounds yesterday.

227
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,990
I was cutting you some slack.

228
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,400
Sit over here.

229
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,510
I'm old now. I can't stand the coldness.

230
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,160
All right.

231
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,430
Manager.

232
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,600
You're playing?

233
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,710
Have you added the charcoal?

234
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,670
Yes.

235
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,920
Don't just focus on the game.

236
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,270
Make sure to check
the water gauge regularly.

237
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:53,950
Oh, right.

238
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,320
Keep an eye on the charcoal in the yard.

239
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:57,710
Don't worry.

240
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,360
I...

241
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,360
I'll do routine checks.

242
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:02,670
I do that every day.

243
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,510
Dafu.

244
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:15,670
Dafu.

245
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:16,430
Stop yelling.

246
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,120
Dafu, you can't do this.

247
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,950
You can't do this to me.

248
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,320
I've been nice to you.

249
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,840
You can't just throw me away

250
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,710
like a rag

251
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,120
- like those men did.
- What are you on about?

252
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,030
Don't talk nasty about me.

253
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,190
You can't do this to me.

254
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,160
No.

255
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,230
- Let go.
- Please take me.

256
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,400
- Stop yelling.
- Please take me.

257
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,120
Dafu,

258
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,320
you're so cruel.

259
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,320
Please take me.

260
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,840
Please take me.

261
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,120
Check.

262
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:07,710
Well,

263
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,030
I lost.

264
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:14,120
Wang Liang, you've improved a lot.

265
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,160
Whose turn now?

266
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,560
It's your turn, Master.

267
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:53,990
Check.

268
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:07,750
Master,

269
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,230
someone's out there.

270
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,080
Again, check.

271
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,230
Master, I think there's a thief.

272
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:25,190
I'll go and take a look.

273
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,840
What's there to look at?
I checked just now.

274
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,510
Come. You won again this time.

275
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,270
Let's have another round.

276
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,400
Will you treat me well?

277
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,800
I will.

278
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:14,800
I will treat you well.

279
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:27,710
[2012]

280
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,540
[Haotai Hotel]

281
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,710
Officer Luo.

282
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,990
Where are you going at this hour?

283
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,270
It's been a while since I've come back.

284
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,510
I want to drive around here.

285
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,710
With luggage?

286
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,080
Why? Are you leaving Kulu?

287
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,120
No,

288
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,120
of course not.

289
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,990
Well, I came back

290
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,080
and bought a lot of things

291
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,320
for my relatives.

292
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,360
I was about to head over.

293
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,400
That's a lot.

294
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:46,030
Right.

295
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:46,750
Dafu.

296
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:49,990
Ms. Luo, you're here, too.

297
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:50,920
Oh, Wang Liang.

298
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,880
Dafu, what took you so long?

299
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,270
Yingying is waiting for you at home.

300
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,360
What's wrong with you?

301
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,320
You finally come back.

302
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,470
Why did you stay at a hotel?

303
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,160
Ms. Luo might think we're absurd.

304
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:03,560
I happened to run into Officer Luo.

305
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,320
We were chatting a little.

306
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,750
I was about to head over.

307
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,510
Good.

308
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,360
Well, Ms. Luo.

309
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,430
After Duoduo left,

310
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:11,400
Yingying has been upset.

311
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,230
Dafu rarely comes back,

312
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:14,360
so I was hoping he'd
talk some sense into her.

313
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,120
Go ahead, then.

314
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,160
Let's go, Dafu.

315
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:23,670
Sure.

316
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:24,360
We're leaving.

317
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,270
I was tied up,

318
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,030
and my superior kept pressuring me.

319
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,270
I honestly had no choice.

320
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,750
You haven't been back for long.

321
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,800
You must've forgotten about your sister.

322
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,990
That's impossible.

323
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,320
Yingying raised me by herself.

324
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,120
She's the last person I'd forget,

325
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:58,750
right?

326
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,190
We'll see when we get home.

327
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:38,120
Go inside. Yingying's waiting for you.

328
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,750
She's in that room.

329
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:38,950
You're back.

330
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:42,920
Come on in.

331
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,360
What's that smell

332
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:53,950
in this room?

333
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,750
Something's rotten.

334
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,510
I wonder how you managed
to put up with it.

335
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,120
I can only stay here, you know.

336
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:14,710
What are you doing?

337
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,510
Did you forget?

338
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:19,320
Tomorrow is Duoduo's burial.

339
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:21,320
I'm sewing clothes for her.

340
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,430
Well,

341
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,160
you can buy anything
from commercial stores.

342
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:27,400
Why bother doing it yourself?

343
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:43,560
Yingying,

344
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,190
we talked about it last time.

345
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,270
Dad's body

346
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,510
can't always be left

347
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,600
at the police station

348
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,560
without a burial.

349
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,560
This makes us look bad.

350
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,840
The cops can continue
their investigation,

351
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,400
but since the autopsy is done,

352
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,750
can we take the body back

353
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,030
for the funeral?

354
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,400
Are you back only for this?

355
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,270
Duoduo was your niece.

356
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,640
Her funeral is tomorrow.

357
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,030
You only met her once.

358
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:25,750
Have you never thought of her?

359
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:27,840
Of course, I miss her.

360
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,080
But she's gone.

361
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,270
Yingying, you're still young.

362
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,270
You'll have more children.

363
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,360
I've done living with Wang Liang.

364
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,430
That won't do.

365
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,600
Why not?

366
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,560
He's been good to you, no?

367
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,400
What more are you looking for?

368
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,270
I'll wire you 30,000 yuan
when I get back.

369
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,880
Treat yourself to something nice.

370
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:12,640
Get some supplements.

371
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,030
Women stop overthinking

372
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,840
when they have children.

373
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:22,990
50,000 yuan.

374
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:25,560
Is that enough?

375
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,670
Why are you staring at me?

376
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,400
Dafu.

377
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,990
Don't call me Dafu.

378
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:39,880
I've changed the name on my ID.

379
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,430
Okay.

380
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,080
Dazhi.

381
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,880
Is 50,000 yuan

382
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:47,670
the price you set for me and Duoduo?

383
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:51,600
That's harsh.

384
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:54,080
Haven't I done enough for you both?

385
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:07,880
Yingying,

386
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,670
you've always been kind to me
when we were kids.

387
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,230
Yes,

388
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,360
I have.

389
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,750
Mom passed away when we were little.

390
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,470
I'm only two years older than you,

391
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,990
but I've always felt like your mom.

392
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:24,160
Exactly.

393
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:26,800
The elder sister has the duty of a mom.

394
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:31,920
Does that mean
I have to sacrifice for you,

395
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,160
right?

396
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,320
It's not that.

397
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:37,080
Yingying,

398
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,640
stay with Wang Liang.

399
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:41,800
I'll take care of you when you're old.

400
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:42,840
What do you mean by that?

401
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:46,750
You want me to waste my whole life,

402
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:47,880
huh?

403
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,640
Yingying,

404
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,030
you're my sister.

405
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:01,510
Yingying,

406
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:03,840
don't worry.

407
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,400
I'll provide for you.

408
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,880
If you need anything,

409
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:11,030
call me anytime.

410
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:14,920
I'm leaving.

411
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,710
Dafu.

412
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,190
What else?

413
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,470
Mom died early.

414
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,640
I was eight,

415
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,990
and you were six.

416
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:37,230
Mom called me to her bedside

417
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:38,950
and told me

418
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,640
to look after you

419
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,270
after her passing.

420
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,230
I was terrified.

421
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,750
I told her, "I can't.

422
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,430
Mom, I can't."

423
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,560
But she was strict

424
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,230
and said I had to, no matter what.

425
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,880
Then, she died.

426
00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:59,430
Over the years,

427
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,560
I don't remember

428
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,670
much of what Mom did to me.

429
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,030
I just remember that.

430
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:08,840
I...

431
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,270
What's the point of bringing this up?

432
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,230
Is 50,000 not enough?

433
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,560
It's enough.

434
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,400
What I'm saying is

435
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:23,560
I've done more than enough

436
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,750
as a sister.

437
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:31,270
You can go.

438
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:48,750
Dafu,

439
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,560
offer incense for Dad.

440
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,600
After Duoduo's funeral tomorrow,

441
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:24,990
you can go back.

442
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:27,840
I'll take care of Dad.

443
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:50,840
Duoduo,

444
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,360
do you hate me

445
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:56,470
when I sent you over
to Great-grandma's place?

446
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,030
Mom, what does hate mean?

447
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:07,300
[2011]

448
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:13,990
Duoduo, wait for me here.

449
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:16,880
No. I want you to hug me.

450
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,800
It only takes a few minutes.

451
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,150
Wait here, all right?

452
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,470
I don't want to.

453
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,950
Well, sit here.

454
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:31,950
Be good.

455
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,950
Stay here.

456
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,430
Don't run around.

457
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,510
Excuse me.

458
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:51,320
I'm very sorry.

459
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,430
Your child has been diagnosed
with leukemia,

460
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,240
and it's quite severe.

461
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,360
It's reached the mid-stage.

462
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:01,630
Is it curable?

463
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,880
If it's in the early stage,

464
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:07,430
the chances of recovery are higher.

465
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:09,630
But now that it's in the mid-stage,

466
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,550
it's not totally hopeless, though,

467
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,400
but the best solution is

468
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:16,030
to get a hematopoietic stem cell transplant
as soon as possible.

469
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,800
And that requires a compatible donor.

470
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:20,920
Also,

471
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,070
I have to let you know.

472
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,840
The costs will be hefty.

473
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,280
The initial expenses
are thirty to fifty thousand,

474
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:31,240
and the later ones are unknown.

475
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,280
In some lucky cases,
it costs around tens of thousands.

476
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:37,400
Well, for her case,

477
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,280
will you agree to treat her?

478
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,110
Mom.

479
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:05,590
Dr. Wu, you can come up
with a treatment plan.

480
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,840
Our family will take the matching tests.

481
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:36,070
Neither of you is a match.

482
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,240
Even her birth mother isn't a match?

483
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:43,680
Mr. Liu, it's very common

484
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,470
for the mother not to be a match.

485
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,590
Liu, where's the child's dad?

486
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,630
Get him tested quickly.

487
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:55,280
May... Maybe I can talk to him

488
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:57,360
to give it a shot.

489
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,950
The child's health is the priority.

490
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:01,240
Let's not worry about anything else now.

491
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,320
Right.

492
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:04,360
Not just the child's dad,

493
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,800
but any potential donor
can be tested,

494
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:09,800
like relatives and friends.

495
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:11,680
Anyone willing to help can come.

496
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,110
Do you have any other family members?

497
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,110
Yes.

498
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:17,200
I have a younger brother.

499
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:18,880
He's busy. Don't trouble him...

500
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:25,360
Mr. Liu,

501
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:28,200
there have been cases

502
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,200
where the uncle is a match,

503
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,110
even when the mother isn't.

504
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,400
Anyway,

505
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:34,990
it's best to have
any potential donor tested.

506
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,430
Thank you so much, Dr. Wu.

507
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,280
Hello, Yingying?

508
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:54,880
Yes?

509
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,400
I need your help.

510
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:58,470
Duoduo is sick.

511
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,070
Leukemia.

512
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,470
She needs a bone marrow transplant.

513
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,590
Dad and I aren't a match.

514
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,320
Can you find the time

515
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,510
to come back and get tested?

516
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,110
Dazhi, please listen to me.

517
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,280
It won't take your bone marrow.

518
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,550
If you're a match,

519
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:16,920
it just requires a tube of your blood.

520
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:19,070
We'll extract
the hematopoietic stem cell from it,

521
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,630
and Duoduo can be saved.

522
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:21,990
Please find time to come back.

523
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,070
If you're busy,

524
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,800
I'll bring Duoduo to you.

525
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:26,880
Duoduo?

526
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:27,840
Wait.

527
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,760
Yingying, I thought
you didn't care about her.

528
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:32,680
She's my daughter.

529
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,920
I gave birth to her.

530
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,550
She's sick

531
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,680
because I neglected her.

532
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,510
Just thinking about it

533
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:43,680
makes me feel guilty,

534
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,880
so I have to save her.

535
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,470
I have a feeling

536
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,550
that you can save her.

537
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,110
Yingying.

538
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:53,030
Just arrange a time, yes?

539
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:55,240
I'm working on several projects.

540
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,880
Every one of them is a major project.

541
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,840
I really

542
00:38:58,470 --> 00:38:59,800
don't have time.

543
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:01,110
If you're busy,

544
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,110
I'll bring Duoduo to you.

545
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,320
- City hospitals are more experienced.
- No.

546
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,510
Yingying, you don't have to come.

547
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:08,840
You know

548
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,430
I can't be the matching donor.

549
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:11,430
Dazhi, listen.

550
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,030
I see this illness

551
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,470
as a punishment.

552
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:17,590
If you save Duoduo,

553
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,280
you're saving me, too.

554
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,280
You have to come back.

555
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:24,430
Yingying,

556
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:25,590
I'm in the middle

557
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,430
of a meeting.

558
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,470
I can't step out for long.

559
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:30,880
I'll get back to you

560
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,920
once I'm free.

561
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,880
I'm begging you.

562
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,030
Come on, let's drink.

563
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:38,920
It's my family.

564
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,110
They called me.

565
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:13,280
Duoduo.

566
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,510
Mom, hug!

567
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,990
Come. Let me hug you.

568
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,920
What's Wang Liang's relationship
with this child?

569
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,280
He's Duoduo's god uncle.

570
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,470
Here's the thing.

571
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,630
I've told you about this before.

572
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:49,630
The chances of a match are higher

573
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,630
among family members.

574
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,680
Am I clear?

575
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,200
Where's the child's dad?

576
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,990
Is Wang Liang's result out yet?

577
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,590
Not yet.

578
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,590
Didn't you mention you have a brother?

579
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,800
Can he come?

580
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:11,880
He can.

581
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,470
I'll give him a call.

582
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:23,990
Dr. Wu,

583
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:27,430
if no one in the family matches,

584
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:28,400
what else can I do?

585
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,840
Given Duoduo's current situation,

586
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:35,630
a bone marrow transplant

587
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:37,680
is the best treatment plan.

588
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:40,990
Of course, if you're not confident,

589
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:43,680
take the child to hospitals
in the provincial town

590
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,280
and get a second opinion.

591
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,110
Thank you.

592
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,720
Dazhi,

593
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,990
it's been so long since I called you.

594
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:58,280
When are you coming back?

595
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:00,680
I'm busy.

596
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,920
I can't.

597
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,950
In that case,
I'll bring Duoduo over tomorrow.

598
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:05,430
Wait.

599
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:07,070
Don't come, Yingying.

600
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,920
I'm going on a business trip
tomorrow morning.

601
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,920
I'll be away for a month.

602
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,920
Duoduo can't wait for that long.

603
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,470
Dazhi,

604
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,280
please help Duoduo.

605
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:17,680
I'm begging you.

606
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,590
If it weren't for you,

607
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:21,070
I wouldn't have had her.

608
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:23,360
She's your niece.

609
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:23,920
Enough said.

610
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,880
She's a living person.

611
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,680
Just stop it.

612
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,240
Is she really related to me by blood?

613
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,360
You know the reason.

614
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,400
I won't be a match.

615
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:30,720
Well, that's it.

616
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,320
We'll talk
when I get back from the trip.

617
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:38,150
Bravo!

618
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:39,470
You sing so well, Mr. Zhang.

619
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:58,030
Answer me.

620
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:05,200
Didn't you always
not care about the girl?

621
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,590
Whether I care about her,
she's still my daughter.

622
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,800
I have to save her.

623
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:12,990
Go and get Dazhi back today.

624
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:18,630
He's right.

625
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,400
You're adopted.

626
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:22,630
He won't be a match.

627
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,510
I want to give it a try.

628
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,070
I'll give up if it doesn't work.

629
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:28,630
What if it works?

630
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:31,360
What if...

631
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,400
What if it does work,

632
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:37,240
are you going to take his bone marrow?

633
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,360
I don't want his bone marrow.

634
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,880
I only want a tube of blood

635
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,280
to exact the stem cells.

636
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:45,360
Don't worry.

637
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:47,400
It won't affect his body.

638
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:48,880
It won't affect?

639
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,200
If so, why doesn't anyone donate?

640
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:52,280
What do you mean?

641
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:53,880
Is Dazhi's blood

642
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,470
really more important
than my daughter's life?

643
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:57,840
Don't you forget

644
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,630
how he managed to get this far.

645
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:03,680
I didn't mean that.

646
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,070
I didn't say anything.

647
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:06,280
Fine, I'll go.

648
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:07,720
I will go, okay?

649
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:10,950
He's busy with his work.

650
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:12,590
Why do you want him
to come all the way back?

651
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:14,200
He must come back today.

652
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:16,550
If not, I'm not sure what I will do.

653
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:18,880
What do you want to do?

654
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,070
Do you want to ruin our family?

655
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,030
I may

656
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,630
if my patience runs out.

657
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,400
I'll wait for your update.

658
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,470
Duoduo, don't move.

659
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,430
Hold on, Duoduo.

660
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:00,470
All right.

661
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:01,590
Almost done.

662
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:06,920
Duoduo, it's almost done.

663
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:15,320
Liu.

664
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:16,320
Liu.

665
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:21,840
His bone marrow

666
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:23,990
doesn't match, too.

667
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:26,630
You have a brother, right?

668
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,400
Get him here
for the matching test quickly.

669
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,070
It didn't match.

670
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:32,680
How could that be?

671
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:34,320
Dr. Wu, is this a mistake?

672
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,150
How could we not...

673
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:35,840
Shut up.

674
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:38,840
I'm sorry.

675
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:39,720
It's fine.

676
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,880
I'll have my brother come.

677
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:43,880
Sure. As soon as possible.

678
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:53,760
Hello?

679
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:55,280
You're back?

680
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,680
I'm in the yard.

681
00:45:58,070 --> 00:45:58,880
Where are you?

682
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,400
I'm here.

683
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,070
Where's Dazhi?

684
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:10,470
Why isn't he here?

685
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:12,070
Why didn't he come with you?

686
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:13,240
Don't yell.

687
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,920
Keep it down.

688
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:16,110
It's not that he refused to come,

689
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,880
he's too busy.

690
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,430
He's on a business trip now.

691
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,360
His job is important.

692
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,880
His superior wouldn't let him leave.

693
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:26,590
That's a good thing.

694
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:27,470
Oh, right.

695
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,240
He asked me...

696
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,840
He asked me to bring you some money.

697
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:32,360
I'll give you all the money.

698
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,280
Buy something for Duoduo...

699
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,630
I don't want his money!

700
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,070
You...

701
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,470
His job is more important
than Duoduo's life?

702
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,320
It's not that, Yingying.

703
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:40,990
Let go.

704
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:42,430
No, Yingying.

756
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:03,280
So beautiful.

757
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:07,110
Let's go to bed.

758
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:14,110
Mom, have you seen the flower
Uncle talked about?

759
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:25,430
Duoduo, do you hate me

760
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:27,550
when I sent you over
to Great-grandma's place?

761
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,200
Mom, what does hate mean?

762
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:10,470
Mr. Liu,

763
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,110
I'm so sorry about that.

764
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:13,920
Are you all right?

765
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:16,840
The technician was installing
the surveillance in your room,

766
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:17,880
and the breaker tripped.

767
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:19,110
It's fixed now.

768
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,280
I'm truly sorry about that.

769
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:28,400
The camera is installed.

770
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:29,760
Well, you see...

771
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:37,990
Sure. Thank you, Mr. Liu.

772
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:39,320
Wang.

773
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:42,360
Have you done installing?

774
00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:43,280
Yes.

775
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:44,680
All right. Good.

776
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:52,630
Mr. Yang.

777
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:53,200
Good job.

778
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:55,240
You see, the camera is installed.

779
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:58,150
I knew it.

780
00:52:58,590 --> 00:52:59,240
Thank you, Mr. Yang.

781
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:00,280
Sure. Off you go.
