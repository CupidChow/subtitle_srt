00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,230
Thank you, everyone.

4
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,760
Thank you all for coming.

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,640
I am very pleased to welcome everyone
to the signing event

6
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,670
for my new book, "Haunted Love."

7
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,110
I am the author, Guan Qiao.

8
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,200
Before the official release,

9
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,710
I'd like to say a few words.

10
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,320
Recently, many people
have been asking me,

11
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:50,150
what exactly is magical realism?

12
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,960
It's not simply about

13
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,920
magic or fantasy.

14
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,520
Rather, it's a creative genre.

15
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,430
It's more of a tool

16
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,560
than a form of literature, like a knife,

17
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,790
like a bow and arrow.

18
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,230
Like an arrow deeply piercing

19
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,040
the rough leather of reality.

20
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,040
Magical realism literature
has two characteristics.

21
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,480
One is reality,

22
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,840
and the other is deep irony.

23
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,950
As such, it requires the creator

24
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,430
to have ample life experience.

25
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,280
Hey kid, what are you doing?

26
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,310
I'm talking to you.

27
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:35,870
[Haunted Love]
What kind of nonsense is this?

28
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,120
What are you even writing?

29
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,430
Ma, is your scale broken?

30
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,480
So many books!

31
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:47,870
80.

32
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,310
Buy it or don't.

00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,200
Editor Zhao.

35
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,230
Who's Guan Qiao? I'm Guan Qiao!

36
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,710
Where's my manuscript fee?

37
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,000
Didn't we agree?

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,080
What good are those piles
of books to me?

39
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,710
We weighed them, 80 yuan.

40
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,190
What did we agree on?

41
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,710
We had a deal.

42
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,310
You...

43
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,310
You...

44
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:17,960
Hello?

45
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,590
Author Guan?

46
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,870
Author Guan?

47
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,430

00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,920
Why are you sleeping here?

51
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:33,800
I came to rest for a bit.

52
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,040
Finished reading?

53
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,240
I'm a slow reader.

54
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,560
Did you finish it all?

55
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,070
I looked it up.

56
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,680
Back then, there was a forum online

57
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,720
specifically discussing bizarre cases.

58
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,560
Guan Qiao posted

59
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,750
his serial there.

60
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,120
The serial was set in Kulu.

61
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,870
The victim's name was Cheng Chun.

62
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,390
This post gained a lot of attention

63
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,950
on that forum back then.

64
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,800
A publisher found Guan Qiao,

65
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,160
got the rights, and changed the names.

66
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:05,040
They compiled it into a novel.

67
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,510
Many details in the novel

68
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,750
were from the case back then

69
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,160
that we hadn’t made public.

70
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,070
So,

71
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,920
I think Guan Qiao might know

72
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,950
something we don’t.

73
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,920
What’s your plan?

74
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,680
Talk to him.

75
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,720
Sure.

76
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,720
I’ll nap for another ten minutes.

77
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,040
Alright, nap away.

78
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:33,920
I just got back

79
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,870
from a book signing.

80
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,920
I’m really lacking inspiration now.

81
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,360
I think you'd be perfect

82
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,310
as the protagonist in my next book.

83
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,120
You remind me a lot
of my last girlfriend.

84
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,040
Really?

85
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,720
Really.

86
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,720
You can visit my place sometime.

87
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,750
We could

88
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,920
create together.

89
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,920
I also have some journalist friends
from the province.

90
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,070
They’re all in this field.

91
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,070
I’ll ask them to interview you too.

92
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,310
Aren't you well connected?

93
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,680
You sure know a lot of people.

94
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,720
Guan Qiao.

95
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:30,950
We need to talk.

96
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,680
Come with us.

97
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,120
What is it?

98
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,430
I object.

99
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,600
I was just getting a foot massage
at the foot spa.

100
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,720
Then suddenly, two people came in

101
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,870
and brought me here.

102
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,800
How was I supposed to know
whether that place

103
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,160
was legitimate or not?

104
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,630
We’re not here to talk
about foot massages.

105
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:56,750
We brought you in

106
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,560
to ask about something else.

107
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,310
Please sit.

108
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,630
You live with Sun Caiyun, right?

109
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,920
Yeah, we’re cohabiting.

110
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,830
But that’s consensual between us.

111
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,120
We writers tend to be romantic.

112
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,120
But I’ve never done anything illegal.

113
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,070
Who said you did anything illegal?

114
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,720
Then why arrest me?

115
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,310
I’ve read your "Sandstorm".

116
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,720
It’s really well written.

117
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,360
Officer Luo,

118
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,310
I’m flattered.

119
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,870
Thank you for your high praise.

120
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,920
Especially the details,
they’re incredibly vivid.

121
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,950
Officer Luo,

122
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,870
you truly understand me.

123
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,630
When I was writing this work,

124
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,720
I put a lot of energy into it.

125
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,950
I poured my emotions into it,

126
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,630
and after I finished,
I fell seriously ill.

127
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,950
It wasn’t that simple, was it?

128
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,560
Of course, it wasn’t that simple.

129
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,560
After the book came out, many people
tried to dig up my identity.

130
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:58,310
My fans all know I’m a technical worker.

131
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,310
Some even called me
“the next Liu Cixin”,

132
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,920
that sci-fi writer.

133
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,560
They underestimated me.

134
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,480
How can sci-fi even compare...

135
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,510
Do you know Cheng Chun?

136
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,870
The female protagonist
in your novel, Chun,

137
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,950
resembles the real Cheng Chun.

138
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,510
And your character Chen Yuanbao

139
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,680
closely mirrors the real Ding Baoyuan.

140
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,600
Their professions
and social relationships

141
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,800
are eerily similar.

142
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,870
How do you explain that?

143
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,680
That case was so sensational.

144
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,320
It was all over the newspapers
and the internet.

145
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,360
Which newspapers or websites

146
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,320
ever mentioned Ding Baoyuan
and Cheng Chun having an affair?

147
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:46,510
Guan Qiao,

148
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,440
based on your novel,

149
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,550
your love for Cheng Chun
turned into hatred,

150
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,840
or rather, a desire to possess her.

151
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,550
You felt she betrayed you,

152
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,360
so you decided to kill Cheng Chun

153
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,150
and frame Ding Baoyuan for it.

154
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,000
Then,

155
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,790
during one of Ding Baoyuan
and Cheng Chun’s secret meetings,

156
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,480
you secretly made a copy of the key
to the heating station

157
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,150
that Ding Baoyuan always carried
on his belt loop.

158
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,030
You then used Ding Baoyuan’s name

159
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,910
to lure Cheng Chun
to the heating station.

160
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,240
You killed Cheng Chun
outside the station,

161
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,510
and then used the fabricated key

162
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:20,080
to carry her body inside
and stuff it into the furnace.

163
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,150
After that, you used
one of your book fans,

164
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,910
Sun Caiyun, who happens
to be Ding Baoyuan’s wife,

165
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,270
to frame Ding Baoyuan.

166
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:30,080
It's just a novel, Officer Luo.

167
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,240
It’s fiction, a work of imagination.

168
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,790
But you wrote it in the first person,

169
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,200
saying you were the one
who killed Cheng Chun

170
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,750
and framed Ding Baoyuan.

171
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,840
I had to write it that way
to get readers.

172
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,080
Only by writing it like that
could I get clicks.

173
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,000
Look, English novelist Defoe's

174
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,360
"Robinson Crusoe",

175
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,360
Japanese novelist Murakami's
"Norwegian Wood",

176
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,480
and Chinese novelist Liu's
"The Wandering Earth".

177
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,510
They all wrote in the first person.

178
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,670
You have to write that way
for readers to care.

179
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:58,000
You think we could really put
an engine on Earth?

180
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,120
It's all nonsense.

181
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,120
Cheng Chun was murdered,

182
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,720
and the original suspect, Ding Baoyuan,

183
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,320
has been exonerated.

184
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,630
I’ve now listed you as a prime suspect.

185
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,320
On what grounds?

186
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,720
Do you have any evidence?

187
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,510
Do you know Cheng Chun?

188
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,120
Yes, I know her.

189
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,480
How do you know her? Tell me.

190
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,790
She had a stall at the night market.

191
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,480
She sold spicy hotpot.

192
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,320
She was quite pretty.

193
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,600
At the time, I was a young artist,

194
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,910
really poor, barely surviving.

195
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,480
I met her at her stall.

196
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,150
When she found out I was a writer,

197
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,200
she started flirting with me.

198
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,240
One thing led to another,
and we got together.

199
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,910
She seduced me first.

200
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,390
So, how did you feel about Cheng Chun?

201
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,360
Is it like what you wrote in your novel?

202
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,440
Hatred born from love,
filled with possessiveness?

203
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,720
She seduced me first.

204
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,720
I’m a writer.

205
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,000
I told her I came to Kulu

206
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,670
to find inspiration for my novel.

207
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,720
Once I found it, I’d return
to the provincial city.

208
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,670
After hearing that,
she was totally into me.

209
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,720
Later,

210
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,080
I heard that Cheng Chun
was involved in prostitution.

211
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,360
That’s when we ended things.

212
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,240
And then I heard that
Cheng Chun was dead,

213
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,480
and you guys arrested Ding Baoyuan.

214
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,720
Everyone in the streets was
talking about it at the time.

215
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,240
There were all kinds of rumors.

216
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,120
I figured if I wrote a book about it,
it would definitely be a hit.

217
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,910
So I wrote the novel from the
perspective of the murderer

218
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,030
and serialized it online.

219
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,670
I did it all

220
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,750
out of my love for literature.

221
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:41,320
Cheng Chun’s death has absolutely
nothing to do with me.

222
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:43,480
Guan Qiao,

223
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,870
what’s the connection
between Chen Yuanbao and Chun

224
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,120
in real life?

225
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,720
Are you referring to Ding Baoyuan
and Cheng Chun?

226
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,480
They were together for a while,

227
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,510
then Sun Caiyun stepped in.

228
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,870
That’s all I know.

229
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,440
Guan Qiao,

230
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,150
you'd better think carefully.

231
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,550
Is there anything else
you haven’t told us?

232
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,480
If we find out you’re
withholding information,

233
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,030
it won’t be this easy next time.

234
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,720
That’s really all I know.

235
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,200
In my book,

236
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,270
some parts were things
Cheng Chun told me,

237
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:19,870
and other parts

238
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,750
were pieced together from the internet.

239
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,480
That’s all I know, I swear.

240
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,320
We should re-interrogate
Ding Baoyuan immediately.

241
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,840
A novel can’t be used
as evidence, can it?

242
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,200
We don’t have any evidence
besides the novel.

243
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,320
So what do you suggest?

244
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,510
You’re the leader.
I’ll follow your lead.

245
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,240
Chief Wang, you’re here.

246
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,360
Let me introduce you.

247
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,670
Chief Wang, I’m Chen Jianghe.

248
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,750
It's great to finally meet you.

249
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,030
Jianghe,

250
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,790
take a look at this for me.

251
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:52,750
What is it?

252
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,360
It was tucked inside the files

253
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,440
of the 226 homicide case.

254
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,240
It doesn’t match the evidence list.

255
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,320
It looks familiar.

256
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,120
I’ve seen it somewhere before.

257
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,150
Could it have been
mistakenly placed here

258
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,240
from another case?

259
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,320
No, that’s impossible.

260
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,000
No way.

261
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,720
Luo,

262
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:13,910
you and Jianghe

263
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,550
should carefully investigate
this case again.

264
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,200
Got it.

265
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,840
Chief Wang, if you're free,

266
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,910
I can treat you to the
best noodles in town.

267
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,870
It looks familiar.

268
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,510
Where have I seen it before?

269
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:41,840
Perhaps

270
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,550
there was a mix-up?

271
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,150
Before we archive cases,

272
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:47,030
we thoroughly check everything.

273
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,670
Besides the original files
and backup copies,

274
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,440
nothing unrelated to the case

275
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,720
would ever be placed in the archives.

276
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,120
Qian,

277
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,440
check the borrow records

278
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,870
for the 226 homicide case.

279
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,790
The last person to borrow it
was Captain Ge.

280
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,080
He also borrowed

281
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,240
all the materials from the

282
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,120
2003 fall anti-vice operation.

283
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,720
The 2003 fall anti-vice operation?

284
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:12,240
I participated in the arrest
of Cheng Chun.

285
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,120
When did Captain Ge return these files?

286
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,910
After Captain Ge’s incident,

287
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,320
Commissioner Liu helped organize
and return them.

288
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,320
Liu Changlin?

289
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:29,510
Qian,

290
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,270
help me find the materials

291
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,120
from the 2003 fall anti-vice operation,

292
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,630
especially anything related
to Cheng Chun.

293
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,720
Got it.

294
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,320
Chen,

295
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,390
here’s everything

296
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,870
from the 2003 anti-vice operation.

297
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,600
Cheng Chun’s belongings and records

298
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,910
should all be in here.

299
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:10,750
Thanks.

300
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,840
Thanks.

301
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,150
Anti-vice operation...

302
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,670
You can't look at this.

303
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,510
It's a match.

304
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,120
Cheng Chun's phone book.

305
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,750
It's more like an account book.

306
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,870
There are phone numbers, but no names.

307
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:01,840
Right.

308
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:02,910
These numbers,

309
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,510
what do they mean?

310
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:08,150
Why wouldn’t she include names
in her records?

311
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,750
Yeah, why is that?

312
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,440
How could I be so dumb?

313
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,150
My mentor should have
realized this back then.

314
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:23,480
He should have started with
Cheng Chun’s social connections.

315
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,510
So foolish.

316
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,270
Let's keep this for now
and check the rest.

317
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,240
There are 32 numbers in the phone book.

318
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,480
One is from the provincial city,

319
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,000
and it’s not registered
under a real name.

320
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,550
The rest are all local numbers.

321
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,720
There’s Ding Baoyuan’s number
from before he went to prison.

322
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,910
[Ding Baoyuan]
This is the one.

323
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,120
Ding Baoyuan

324
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,840
13119461571.

325
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,320
Unregistered number.

326
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,550
4232.

327
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,400
We’ve found evidence

328
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,960
of a connection between Ding Baoyuan
and Cheng Chun.

329
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:09,720
Return this to the archives.

330
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:10,750
Okay.

331
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,680
When are we interrogating Ding Baoyuan?

332
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:14,720
When are we interrogating Ding Baoyuan?

333
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,480
Now.

334
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,440
This is Cheng Chun's account book
from before she died.

335
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:25,030
See if your phone number is in there.

336
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,110
Ding Baoyuan,

337
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,640
what exactly was your relationship
with Cheng Chun?

338
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,720
My relationship with my ex-wife
wasn’t great.

339
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,720
Cheng Chun was quite beautiful.

340
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,350
So, naturally, one thing led to another.

341
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,920
We were together for a while,

342
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,310
but it didn’t last long.

343
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,310
I got divorced and married
my current wife.

344
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,480
Cheng Chun found another man,

345
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,350
so we ended things.

346
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:50,920
You didn’t keep in touch after that?

347
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,510
No contact at all?

348
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,310
No.

349
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:57,110
My new wife is younger than her,

350
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,350
and more beautiful.

351
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,030
We’re very happy together.

352
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,960
And Cheng Chun’s reputation
took a turn for the worse.

353
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,550
Why would I still contact her?

354
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,110
Your wife visits you every month.

355
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,720
Not many wives would do that.

356
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,480
You have a healthy and adorable son.

357
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,720
Ding Baoyuan,

358
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,830
tell the truth about your relationship
with Cheng Chun.

359
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,590
Be responsible for yourself
and your family.

360
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,880
I really haven’t been
in contact with her.

361
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:28,270
Here are the phone records from the last
three months before Cheng Chun died.

362
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,880
See if your number is in there.

363
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,270
Officer,

364
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:39,880
look,

365
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,110
I only contacted Cheng Chun a few times

366
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,310
because she got into prostitution.

367
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,350
And it’s clearly noted here.

368
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:48,920
It was just a few times.

369
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,070
I shouldn’t have to serve
eight years for this, right?

370
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,750
Your actions went beyond
just those few times.

371
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:57,200
There’s nothing else.

372
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,110
Ding Baoyuan,

373
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:03,550
you said you were going to see Ma Jincai
on the night of the murder.

374
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,510
Did you run into Cheng Chun on the way?

375
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:06,830
Did she confront you,

376
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,830
and you killed her and stuffed her
into the furnace?

377
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,110
Officer,

378
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,160
why would Cheng Chun confront me?

379
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,110
First, I didn't owe her any money.

380
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,510
Second, we had broken up
a long time ago.

381
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,720
We were through.

382
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,550
She had found other men.

383
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,270
So

384
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,720
according to your logic,

385
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,270
any man who had

386
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,640
a relationship with Cheng Chun

387
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,160
could be a potential suspect?

388
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,750
Tell us about your relationship
with Cheng Chun.

389
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,160
Officer Chen,

390
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,720
I heard you and Cheng Chun

391
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,440
are both from Luoche.

392
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,960
Did you know each other?

393
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,160
There’s a novel called "Sandstorm".

394
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,350
Have you read it?

395
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:55,960
It says in there

396
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,310
that Chun had an affair
with a police officer named Chen.

397
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:00,920
It’s a great read.

398
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,110
You coward.

399
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,030
What’s that supposed to mean?

400
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,070
It’s just a novel.

401
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,550
But,

402
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:29,030
Officer Luo, you should read it.

403
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,510
It’s really well written.

404
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,720
I read it every day.

405
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,110
It’s really well written.

406
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,270
Absolutely brilliant.

407
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,720
Officer Xia, thank you
for your cooperation.

408
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,200
It’s my duty.

409
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,310
I'll let you know if I need
anything else.

410
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,030
Alright.

411
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,640
Chen, it’s time for lunch.

412
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,440
Take me to try some local delicacies.

413
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,200
Let’s go.

414
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,350
See you, Xia.

415
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,030
Lamb noodle or lamb vermicelli?

416
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,310
I’ll have what you're having.

417
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,510
I’ll have the vermicelli.

418
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,200
Vermicelli.

419
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,480
Large or small?

420
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,880
What’s the difference?

421
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,240
The large has four more slices of lamb.

422
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,510
Small then.

423
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,160
Can't handle lamb?

424
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:20,880
It’s a bit gamey.

425
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,640
Their lamb isn’t gamey at all.

426
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:25,920
Proprietor,

427
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,960
two lamb vermicelli,
one large and one small.

428
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,720
Sure.

429
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,510
Try this.

430
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,110
Chen, Kulu is such a small county.

431
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,750
It’s normal for people
to know each other, right?

432
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:43,640
It’s normal.

433
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,720
It’s a small county indeed.

434
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,830
Did you know Cheng Chun?

435
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,000
Yes, I knew her.

436
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,160
Why didn’t you tell me?

437
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,480
You didn’t ask me about it.

438
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:02,640
Do you eat garlic?

439
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:03,510
Yes.

440
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,240
How did you two meet?

441
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,510
What does the case file say?

442
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,110
Cheng Chun

443
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,680
married into Kulu from Luoche.

444
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,240
A year later, her husband died.

445
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,350
To make a living, she started
a small business.

446
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,400
Later, she was arrested
for prostitution.

447
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,070
That’s what the file says.

448
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,030
Thanks.

449
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:25,270
I met Cheng Chun in 2000.

450
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,720
One night after my shift,

451
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,880
I happened to pass by her stall.

452
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,270
I saw some punks

453
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:35,880
harassing her,

454
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,920
so I stepped in.

455
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,590
Please...

456
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:40,310
Just ignore them.

457
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,240
- I don't drink.
- Come on.

458
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,400
- Sit here and have a drink.
- I don't drink.

459
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:42,960
Sir.

460
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,070
Look, I’ll waive your bill, okay?

461
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,240
- I don't drink!
- Come on, have a drink.

462
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,000
Let go!

463
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:47,590
What are you doing?

464
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,200
Mind your own business.

465
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,110
A little tipsy, are you?

466
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,270
Look closely.

467
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:54,590
Look closely!

468
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,310
Put that down!

469
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:57,680
Let’s go.

470
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:58,590
Let's go.

471
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,480
You’re bleeding. Have a wipe.

472
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,110
One lamb vermicelli, please.

473
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,510
It's on the house.

474
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,920
Eat up.

475
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,720
Next time, call the police.

476
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,310
Thank you.

477
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,510
As a token of gratitude,

478
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,550
she started bringing me homemade food.

479
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,640
The third time, I turned her down.

480
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,680
She was so kind to you,

481
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,720
why did you refuse her?

482
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,550
I couldn’t give her false hope.

483
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,310
That’s not in the file, is it?

484
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,480
Nope.

485
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:26,960
And after that,

486
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,720
I went to the provincial city
for two years of training.

487
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,550
Then I returned to Kulu.

488
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,480
We didn’t stay in touch.

489
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,310
Sometime later,

490
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,070
during a prostitution sting,

491
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,720
I arrested her.

492
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:55,310
Then came the murder
at the heating station.

493
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,830
The victim, Cheng Chun.

494
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,350
The protagonist in Guan Qiao’s novel,
Cheng Chun,

495
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,790
just wanted to survive

496
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:04,030
in this small town

497
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,510
without being bullied.

498
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,550
So she placed

499
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,000
all her hopes on men.

500
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,310
It was the only thing
she could depend on.

501
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:12,920
Chen,

502
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:14,960
have you ever thought,

503
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:19,720
if back then you had accepted
Cheng Chun's advances,

504
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,550
her life might have
turned out differently?

505
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,350
Just a thought.

506
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,400
It could have been

507
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,270
a completely different version
of "Sandstorm".

508
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,000
Don't move.

509
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,640
Name.

510
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,160
Put your clothes on.

511
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,350
Squat down, squat down.

512
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,680
Let’s get back to Ding Baoyuan.

513
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,720
The more I think about it,
the more I believe

514
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:11,510
he’s the killer.

515
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,160
From the two times we interrogated him,

516
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:17,550
it’s clear

517
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:19,830
that he's putting on an innocent facade.

518
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,830
He had a clear motive

519
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,030
and the timing fits.

520
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,310
Cheng Chun was still on the street
at 10 PM.

521
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,440
Ding Baoyuan went to see Ma Jincai.

522
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,160
They could have run into each other.

523
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:32,960
Cheng Chun pestered Ding Baoyuan...

524
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,720
And she was killed.

525
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:38,920
Ding Baoyuan said

526
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,750
he wasn't the only man
Cheng Chun was involved with.

527
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:43,880
So why would she

528
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,160
bother him after they had broken up?

529
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,070
After they split,

530
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,400
Ding Baoyuan became wealthy overnight.

531
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,160
Cheng Chun knew he had money,

532
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,510
so she went to him.

533
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,720
That’s possible.

534
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:58,310
If Ding Baoyuan had admitted
to killing Cheng Chun,

535
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,240
why wouldn’t he admit

536
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,030
to knowing her?

537
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,960
If he acknowledged their relationship,

538
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,310
it would look like premeditated murder,

539
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,510
which would mean a harsher sentence.

540
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,550
If that’s the case,

541
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,510
then the heating station

542
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,550
wasn’t the primary crime scene.

543
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,510
The primary crime scene
was on the street,

544
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,920
where Cheng Chun was last seen.

545
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:27,920
Maybe

546
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,350
in the end,

547
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,680
this will be a case of reasonable doubt.

548
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,400
Excuse me.

549
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,200
Hello?

550
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,310
There’s been progress in the case,

551
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,110
but we haven’t found the evidence yet.

552
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:55,640
Alright, don’t worry.

553
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,510
Bye.

554
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,270
Madam Wang is back.

555
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,590
Jianghe, you’re here.

556
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,590
Dear me.

557
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:18,310
Listen to me.

558
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:22,000
You don't have to come here
all the time.

559
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,480
Focus on solving your case.

560
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,510
I’ve changed the diaper
and fed the baby.

561
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,110
Wash up and have dinner, Madam Wang.

562
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,790
Shouldn’t have given you the keys.

563
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,310
I'm going to wash up.

564
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,720
You even made dinner.

565
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,400
That’s wonderful.

566
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,270
Look at this.

567
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,510
Eat it while it's warm.

568
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,200
No thanks.

569
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,110
I was starving earlier

570
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:18,750
and had two bowls
of lamb vermicelli soup.

571
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,590
I'm still digesting.

572
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,680
Why did you eat that
when this is so much better?

573
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,000
I prefer that.

574
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,920
You’ve really improved, it's delicious.

575
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,310
Is it?

576
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,400
Yes.

577
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:36,480
You really let yourself go
since moving to Luoche.

578
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,440
How?

579
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,400
Why don’t you take better care
of yourself?

580
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,680
Don't I look good right now?

581
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,550
Look how long your hair is.

582
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,480
It is a bit long.

583
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:51,110
I’ll give you a haircut later.

584
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,200
No thanks.

585
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,750
I’ll just get a haircut

586
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,310
at the barber's.

587
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,000
Why spend the money?

588
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:58,960
Your mentor has been bedridden
for almost eight years.

589
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,000
I’ve been doing everything for him.

590
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,480
Just let me finish my meal first.

591
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:05,720
Alright.

592
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,640
My mentor worked in the police force

593
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,960
for 28 years.

594
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,480
He sure did.

595
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,920
In all these years,

596
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:29,960
has my mentor

597
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:31,920
ever had a case

598
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,960
he couldn't let go of?

599
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,200
Yes.

600
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,110
The heating station case.

601
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,110
Why couldn’t he let it go?

602
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,160
I think ever since Ding Baoyuan
was sentenced,

603
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,750
your mentor has been troubled by it.

604
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:00,310
Since you remember this case so clearly,

605
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,030
then it must be

606
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:04,310
a real burden for my mentor.

607
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,110
Ge's issue is my issue too.

608
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,270
I heard

609
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,350
that the bureau is
re-investigating the case.

610
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,790
I suppose the reason you're back

611
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,310
is to take charge of it?

612
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,200
Not exactly in charge,
I’m just helping out.

613
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:25,510
Jianghe,

614
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,310
if you’re going to investigate
this case, do it properly.

615
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,920
Hopefully, it'll give
your mentor closure.

616
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:09,430
[Year 2004]

617
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,160
Ding Baoyuan,

618
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,920
do you know Cheng Chun?

619
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,110
Do you know her or not?

620
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:24,880
I know of her.

621
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,310
Just say if you know her or not.

622
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:28,920
I don’t know her.

623
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:39,920
Ding Baoyuan, tell us
how the crime happened

624
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,920
one more time.

625
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:45,550
I returned to the station at 10:30.

626
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:48,480
I saw someone standing by the coal pile.

627
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,920
I thought it was a coal thief.

628
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:52,400
I figured

629
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:54,200
I’d teach her a lesson.

630
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,000
There were two workers on that shift.

631
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:58,310
I was the shift supervisor,
so there were three of us.

632
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,790
There was only one key,
and I had it the whole time.

633
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:03,510
I hit her head with a shovel.

634
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,350
She collapsed there and then.

635
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,160
I didn’t mean to kill her.

636
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:08,920
It was a mistake.

637
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:11,680
I was trying to protect state property.

638
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,000
You’re legally responsible

639
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,880
for your confession.

640
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,110
Ding Baoyuan,

641
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,400
you killed someone.

642
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,510
You understand the
legal consequences, right?

643
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,510
I didn’t mean to kill her.

644
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,000
It was a mistake.

645
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,960
I was protecting state property.

646
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,110
I didn’t mean to kill.

647
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,750
I didn’t intend to kill.

648
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,880
It was a mistake.

649
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:54,720
Officer, it was a mistake.

650
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,720
Whether she was dead or unconscious

651
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,400
before being shoved into the furnace,

652
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:01,270
Ding Baoyuan already admitted
to killing her.

653
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,550
Why are you being so reckless?

654
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,190
Didn’t you know Cheng Chun?

655
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:14,110
You interrogated her before, didn't you?

656
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,880
Do you know who she hung out with?

657
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,400
She ran a stall at the night market

658
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,670
and was involved in prostitution.

659
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,510
Then go investigate.

660
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:31,320
See if there’s any connection
between Ding Baoyuan

661
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:32,920
and Cheng Chun.

662
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,800
Hello, honey.

663
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,960
I’m with my mentor right now.

664
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,880
Why don't you ask him?

665
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,760
I've told her.

666
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,320
Once this case is solved, we’re leaving.

667
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,320
Did you hear that?
Once it’s solved, we’re leaving.

668
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,360
Hurry up and investigate.

669
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,280
Once this case is solved, we’re leaving.

670
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,070
Seems like you don’t want to leave.

671
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:25,320
Did a lot of men come looking for her?

672
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:28,190
Was she familiar with Ding Baoyuan
from the heating station?

673
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,510
This is a life-and-death matter,

674
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:32,190
so I don’t dare to speak lightly.

675
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,590
But I never saw them interact.

676
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:49,050
[On the Six States]

677
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:06,070
Is this Cheng Chun’s handwriting?

678
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,000
Sir, can we transfer this case?

679
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,070
How could we?

680
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:20,710
Didn’t Ding Baoyuan already confess?

681
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,960
But without evidence

682
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:24,760
to back up the suspect’s confession,

683
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,320
how can we transfer it?

684
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,320
What will we use to convict him?

685
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:31,920
It was Ding Baoyuan who withdrew money
from Cheng Chun’s bank account.

686
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,110
Even his wife Sun Caiyun identified him.

687
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,400
Did you find the bank card?

688
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,880
Did his wife witness the murder?

689
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:49,920
The defendant, Ding Baoyuan,
is convicted of homicide.

690
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:53,400
He is sentenced to death,
with a two-year reprieve.

691
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,920
His political rights
are revoked for life.

692
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:59,510
He will be detained
in the detention center.

693
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,150
Court is now adjourned.

694
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:10,550
Baoyuan.

695
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,110
Baoyuan, don’t worry.

696
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,880
I’ll take good care of the child.

697
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,710
Baoyuan...

698
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,280
I'll be okay.

699
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:51,840
Sir,

700
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,110
let’s go.

701
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:14,840
Working overtime?

702
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,760
Did you get a haircut?

703
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:17,060
[Sandstorm]

704
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:18,920
So it is noticeable.

705
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,110
Luo,

706
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:26,760
today you mentioned
Ding Baoyuan’s motive.

707
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,110
I’ve been thinking about it,

708
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,920
and I don’t think it holds up.

709
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:31,880
Why not?

710
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,110
Here’s what I’m thinking,

711
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,280
Ding Baoyuan

712
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,070
wouldn’t be afraid of Cheng Chun

713
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:41,110
revealing their affair to Sun Caiyun

714
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:43,510
because

715
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,670
they were together

716
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,800
before Sun Caiyun came into the picture.

717
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:51,880
Besides,

718
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,800
getting on with Ding Baoyuan

719
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,400
is like hitting the jackpot
for Sun Caiyun.

720
00:38:57,230 --> 00:39:00,280
Ding Baoyuan wouldn’t kill Cheng Chun

721
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,920
over blackmail.

722
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,590
So according to you,

723
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:07,000
Ding Baoyuan had no motive to kill,

724
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,150
so he isn’t the killer.

725
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,710
Why did he

726
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:12,670
confess to the murder back then?

727
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:19,190
I swear on my life,

728
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,550
we did not force a confession.

729
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:24,480
He admitted it himself at the time.

730
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,280
There’s another possibility.

731
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:28,880
What?

732
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:30,510
He took the fall for someone else.

733
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,070
For who?

734
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,840
Eight years ago,

735
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:37,880
the only family he had left

736
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,710
was his daughter from his ex-wife

737
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,880
and his pregnant wife, Sun Caiyun.

738
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,480
You mean he took the fall
for Sun Caiyun?

739
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,760
It’s possible.

740
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,920
The two women were fighting over him,

741
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,760
and in the heat of the moment,
Sun Caiyun killed Cheng Chun

742
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,480
and threw her into the furnace.

743
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,550
But that day,

744
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:00,760
Sun Caiyun was with
that thug, Ma Jincai.

745
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,960
She couldn't have committed the crime.

746
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:15,110
Then we’re left with
Liu Sancheng and Wang Liang.

747
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,960
Could the two of them
have done it together?

748
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:21,840
If they worked together,

749
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,710
Cheng Chun would’ve been
incinerated into ashes

750
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:25,760
before she fell out of the furnace.

751
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:30,030
What if

752
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,280
it was one of them?

753
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,550
That’s just speculation.

754
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,070
Yours is speculation too.

755
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:50,920
Yes, it’s speculation.

756
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:56,800
We’ve made progress on
gathering evidence, though.

757
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,510
Come in.

758
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,760
Luo.

759
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:02,550
Commissioner Liu, Chief Wang,
you wanted to see me?

760
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,800
What’s going on?

761
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:06,920
How's your collaboration
with Chen Jianghe? Good?

762
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,670
Yeah, it’s been good.

763
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:12,070
Any progress on the case?

764
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,710
Chen told me

765
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:14,920
an interesting theory.

766
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,760
What theory?

767
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,800
He said,

768
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,960
Ding Baoyuan might have

769
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,190
taken the fall for someone else.

770
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,400
For who?

771
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:27,070
His wife, Sun Caiyun.

772
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,440
Right now, it’s just speculation.

773
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,070
We don’t have solid evidence yet.

774
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:35,550
Luo, when we investigate cases,
we need evidence.

775
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:36,960
We can’t rely solely on speculation.

776
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,000
Please elaborate.

777
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,880
Through our investigation,

778
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,710
we found that Ding Baoyuan
had a complicated family life.

779
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:44,230
After he went to prison,

780
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:46,110
his wife, Sun Caiyun, lived with someone

781
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:47,920
named Guan Qiao.

782
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:48,960
This Guan Qiao

783
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,800
wrote a novel called "Sandstorm".

784
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,880
The plot in the novel

785
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,190
uncannily matches our case

786
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:56,360
down to all the details.

787
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,710
You're speculating based on a novel?

788
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:00,480
That’s not all.

789
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,320
You see,

790
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:05,760
we found an account book

791
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,190
in Cheng Chun’s belongings.

792
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,550
It recorded the phone numbers

793
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:10,480
of many men she had

794
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,480
inappropriate relationships with,

795
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,110
and one of the numbers
belonged to Ding Baoyuan.

796
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,230
Also, upon reviewing
the old case files,

797
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:17,360
I found that Cheng Chun’s
social connections

798
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,400
was a blind spot.

799
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,920
So I think moving forward,

800
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,320
we focus on investigating

801
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,590
Cheng Chun's social connections.

802
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:27,800
Since we now have a lead,

803
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,510
let’s have them investigate.

804
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:31,840
All of you should have received

805
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:32,550
your assignments.

806
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,070
Li, come here.

807
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:35,550
You’re responsible for finding
these two people.

808
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:36,320
Ma,

809
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:38,320
you’re responsible for these two.

810
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:40,320
Officer,

811
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:41,960
my brother hasn’t done anything wrong.

812
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,510
Why are you taking him away?

813
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,280
What’s going on?

814
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:45,880
He’s a good person!

815
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,110
Good at soliciting prostitution?

816
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:01,840
We'll talk inside.

817
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:03,510
Let’s go.

818
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:07,320
Officer, it was only one time.

819
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,710
Honestly.

820
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:10,070
It was just once.

821
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,550
- Just once.
- Sit down.

822
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:14,710
Let me repeat.

823
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,550
The first day, you had braised lamb.

824
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:17,550
Sit down.

825
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:20,710
Do you know Cheng Chun?

826
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,590
You should know

827
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:23,630
why we brought you in.

828
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:24,230
No, I don’t.

829
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:25,110
Listen here...

830
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:26,110
How dare you?

831
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,110
Not cooperating, are you?

832
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:29,960
You don't think I’ll detain you?

833
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,280
What’s going on?

834
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:52,710
Ma.

835
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:55,550
What’s up?

836
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,510
Is this the bank surveillance footage
from back then?

837
00:43:58,510 --> 00:43:59,190
Yes.

838
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:00,440
It was through this footage

839
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,550
that we identified
Ding Baoyuan as the suspect.

840
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,070
Skip to 1:17.

841
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,760
Isn’t that Ding Baoyuan?

842
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,960
Look at the part where Ding Baoyuan
identified the scene.

843
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:35,110
What’s the difference?

844
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:39,150
Isn’t that Ding Baoyuan?

845
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,280
No difference.

846
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,320
No difference.

847
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,440
Which leg does Ding Baoyuan limp on?

848
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:52,400
The right leg.

849
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:53,550
The right leg.

850
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,550
Does his right leg bend?

851
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,480
It doesn’t bend, right?

852
00:44:58,510 --> 00:44:59,070
No, it doesn’t.

853
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,590
That’s odd.

854
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:01,320
It doesn’t bend.

855
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:04,110
It doesn’t bend.

856
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:05,320
Watch it again.

857
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,800
It doesn’t bend, right?

858
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,110
Who is it?

859
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,070
Sir.

860
00:45:15,070 --> 00:45:18,000
I’m calling you from Mom’s phone.

861
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:20,920
Duoduo, what’s up?

862
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:24,110
Uncle picked a beautiful
datura flower for me.

863
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:26,280
I want you to come and see it too.

864
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,550
I'm at work.

865
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,000
I’ll see you after work, okay?

866
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,190
Okay.

867
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,960
It’s a deal.

868
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,070
Definitely.

869
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:37,880
Goodbye.

870
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:38,840
Goodbye.

871
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,280
Look at the bank footage again.

872
00:45:58,360 --> 00:45:59,710
Ma, rewind it a bit.

873
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:01,760
Ding Baoyuan’s gait

874
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,710
while going down the steps
is different in the two videos.

875
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,070
Someone impersonated Ding Baoyuan
to withdraw money at the bank.

876
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:13,280
What about the witness who identified

877
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,400
Ding Baoyuan at the door?

878
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,110
The old lady at the bank entrance

879
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,110
who sells buns?

880
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,400
She’s never had anyone
take her seriously in her life.

881
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:28,920
Now's her chance to shine.

882
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:33,110
Now we can prove that this case

883
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:34,550
does have reasonable doubt.

884
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,710
According to the principle
of presumption of innocence,

885
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,480
we can declare Ding Baoyuan not guilty.

886
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:40,880
Not the presumption of innocence!

887
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:43,880
That’s the modern rule of law.

888
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:47,360
When he comes out of prison,

889
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,230
he’ll still bear the stigma
of a murder suspect.

890
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:52,070
Life won’t be easy for him.

891
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,400
It's tough.

892
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,440
Future of the police force.

893
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:11,880
Stop staring, don’t learn from me.

894
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:24,480
Bring the trash bin here.

895
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:41,400
Want some fruit?

896
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:46,960
I'll peel you an orange.

897
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,710
Mom, my nose is bleeding.

898
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,550
Tilt your head back, Duoduo.

899
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,110
Duoduo.

900
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:05,960
Duoduo!

901
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:07,670
Tilt your head, Duoduo.

902
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:08,590
Doctor Wu.

903
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:09,920
Doctor Wu!

904
00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:12,400
Doctor Wu!

905
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,190
Where is the little girl?

906
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:53,320
Her nose is bleeding.

907
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:55,190
Nurse.

908
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,480
Where is the little girl,
Duoduo, from this bed?

909
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,630
She's downstairs being resuscitated.

910
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,000
Hello, doctor. I'm here
to get some medicine.

911
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,000
Give me the prescription.

912
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:26,520
Sure.

913
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,110
Doctor, is there something wrong
with this prescription?

914
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,560
I'm very sorry.

915
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:33,630
We couldn't save her.

916
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:34,880
My condolences.

917
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:29,360
Duoduo.

918
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:32,150
Duoduo.

919
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:36,590
Officer Chen, you're here too?

920
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:38,080
Duoduo.

921
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:39,790
Duoduo.

922
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:45,870
Duoduo.

923
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:52,480
Let me see her one more time.

924
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:55,920
