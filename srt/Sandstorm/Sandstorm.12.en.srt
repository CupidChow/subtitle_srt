00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,310
Mr. Chen,

2
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,840
it's dangerous to wear sunglasses
when driving at night.

00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:44,040
[Sandstorm]
[Episode 12]

4
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:44,800
Come on.

5
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,800
Where should I start?

6
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,560
Since when did you decide

7
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,710
to work with Wang Liang

8
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,430
to kill your dad and brother?

9
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,520
I've always had this thought.

10
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:14,710
Wang Liang

11
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,310
agreed to let me go,

12
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,310
but Liu Sancheng didn't.

13
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,800
He wanted to sacrifice me

14
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,070
for the rest of my life.

15
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,040
Yingying,

16
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,600
we already have a daughter now.

17
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,830
Let's just live a good life together,
okay?

18
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,630
You wish.

19
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,360
The baby is hungry.

20
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,830
Just take a look at her.

21
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,630
Carry her away.

22
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,040
I'll leave her with you
for the night.

23
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,310
I'll leave her here.

24
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:46,920
If you put her down,

25
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,920
I'll throw her out the window.

26
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,160
If you hate me so much,

27
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,390
go find someone you like.

28
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,270
Do you mean it?

29
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,920
I mean it.

30
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:09,160
Don't worry, nothing will change.

31
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,920
Wang Liang,

32
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,310
take

33
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,390
the baby outside for a while.

34
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,430
I'll have a word with Yingying.

35
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,000
Yingying,

36
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,120
you can't leave Wang Liang.

37
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,510
Why?

38
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,720
He said he wouldn't reveal it.

39
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,920
Who can guarantee
that he will never reveal it?

40
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,040
You are the only one in his heart.

41
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,510
He's just trying
to make you happy now.

42
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,190
If you really leave,
you'll have to find another man.

43
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,430
How would he feel if he knew you were

44
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,630
with another man?

45
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,240
What if he regrets it?

46
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,040
I won't believe him
if he still keeps it a secret

47
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,830
at that point.

48
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,120
Dad,

49
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,680
I beg you.

50
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,800
Just say yes.

51
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,070
I can't take it anymore.

52
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,120
I'm sick of it,

53
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,360
Dad.

54
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,870
I know.

55
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,510
You've suffered

56
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,360
for this.

57
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,750
Just put up with it
for a little while longer.

58
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,120
It's just a man.

59
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,920
No matter who you are with,
life goes on.

60
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,120
You can't let your capriciousness

61
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,190
get the whole family into trouble.

62
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,040
Dad. Dad,

63
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,240
I beg you. Please let me go.

64
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,920
I know my brother is important.

65
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,070
You can't ruin my life

66
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,920
because of my brother.

67
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,920
Dad, look at me.

68
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,950
I was raised by you, too.

69
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:12,070
Dad, look at me. I'm a human being.

70
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,800
I beg you.

71
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,000
What's wrong with Wang Liang?

72
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,070
What's so terrible about him?

73
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,070
He spoils you, coaxes you, obeys you,

74
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,480
feeds you with food and drink.

75
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,190
What more do you want?

76
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,870
What kind of life do you want?

77
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,390
Listen here,

78
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,920
don't even think about it

79
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,190
unless I'm dead.

80
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,950
Fine.

81
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:45,950
Fine.

82
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:53,800
Leave now.

83
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,000
Yingying,

84
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,750
I beg you, too.

85
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,510
You've sacrificed for our family.

86
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,510
You...

87
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:19,800
You mustn't change your mind again,
okay?

88
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,560
I won't change my mind.

89
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,800
I'm already dead.

90
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,830
For the rest of my life,
I will be Wang Liang's hostage.

91
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,320
All my life,

92
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,320
I have to live for you
and my brother.

93
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:40,790
Leave

94
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,510
and live a good life with my brother.

95
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,120
Things had come to this,

96
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,120
and I had thought
about resigning myself to it.

97
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,750
I was dead anyway,

98
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,120
but they shouldn't have harmed...

99
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,390
Yes.

100
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,670
They shouldn't have harmed
my daughter, Duoduo.

101
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,840
They went too far.

102
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,240
Hello.

103
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,870
Yingying, where did you take Duoduo?

104
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,320
I can't find you in the hospital.

105
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm taking Duoduo out for a walk.

106
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,790
I'll hang up now.

107
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:30,960
Mom,

108
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,270
where are we going?

109
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,480
I'll take you to see your uncle,

110
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:38,670
okay?

111
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,600
Okay.

112
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,320
Hi, are you looking for Mr. Liu?

113
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,000
Yes, I'm his sister.

114
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,320
Mr. Liu isn't here.

115
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,870
He's having a meal with the superiors.

116
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,750
We always receive our guests
at Blue Ocean Hotel.

117
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,030
You can look for him there.

118
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,840
How do I get there?

119
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,510
Take Bus 11 from the bus stop in front,

120
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,440
it's two stops away.

121
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,390
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

122
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,270
I took Duoduo to see Dazhi.

123
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,030
I wanted Dazhi to see

124
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,440
how cute Duoduo was.

125
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,480
I wanted him to save my poor child.

126
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,630
If he'd done just a little bit

127
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,510
to save Duoduo,

128
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,440
things wouldn't have come to this.

129
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,120
Liu Dazhi,

130
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,240
I'm on the ground floor
of Blue Ocean Hotel.

131
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,240
Whoever you're having a meal
with right now,

132
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,750
you need to come out right now.

133
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:37,670
Mom, what is this place?

134
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,120
It's heaven, isn't it?

135
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,320
Yes. Do you like it?

136
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,720
Are you going?

137
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,870
Yes, I am.

138
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,320
What about Uncle?

139
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,630
He's going, too.

140
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,240
Then I'm coming, too.

141
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,550
All right, as long as you like it.

142
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,240
Yingying,

143
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,550
why are you here again?

144
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,080
What do you mean, again?

145
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,720
Didn't Dad come here a while ago?

146
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,510
I let him bring back 50,000 yuan.

147
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,440
I've brought Duoduo to meet you.

148
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,840
You haven't seen Duoduo once, have you?

149
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,750
Duoduo, this is your Uncle Dazhi.
Call him Uncle.

150
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,120
Duoduo, don't be afraid.

151
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,510
If it wasn't for your uncle,

152
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,200
I wouldn't have given birth to you.

153
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,360
No, why did you say that

154
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,200
to the kid?

155
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,000
She's so little,
she doesn't know anything.

156
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,080
Why wouldn't she know?

157
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,670
Wasn't it because of you, Dazhi?

158
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,480
Uncle.

159
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,200
Good girl.

160
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,790
Duoduo,

161
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:52,720
let me hold you.

162
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,870
Let me hold you, okay?

163
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,510
Come with me.

164
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,630
Wait for your mom here.

165
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,870
I'll give you 10,000 yuan later.

166
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,750
Buy her something

167
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,080
and find a restaurant to eat.

168
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,600
I didn't come here to ask for money.

169
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,030
Duoduo's condition is getting worse.

170
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,720
You're my only hope.

171
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,960
Dazhi, don't worry.

172
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,120
It won't have any effect on your health.

173
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,750
It's not an issue
of effecting my health.

174
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:33,910
It's just

175
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,790
that I've been really busy lately.

176
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,200
I thought you didn't like the kid.

177
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,910
What's going on now?

178
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,240
I was wrong before.

179
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,960
I realise now

180
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,960
that Duoduo is my life.

181
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,440
Liu Dazhi,

182
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,550
if you save her,

183
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,000
it means you're saving me.

184
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:58,720
This isn't about saving her
or saving you.

185
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,320
I've been very busy lately.
I can't take leave.

186
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,440
The superiors just came over
to inspect the work

187
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,720
and asked me to lead the briefing.

188
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,360
They're still waiting for me inside.

189
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,720
No, Yingying.
Call me if you need anything

190
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,440
in the future.

191
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,240
Don't come here all of a sudden.

192
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,720
I'm not talking to you.
My superiors are coming over.

193
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,320
No, Dazhi.

194
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,670
Wait for my call.

195
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,440
Liu Dazhi.

196
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,630
I'll wire you the money in a minute.

197
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,240
Liu Dazhi!

198
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,030
Yingying.

199
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,320
Mr. Wang.

200
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,440
Mr. Wang.

201
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,120
Mr. Wang, sorry.

202
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,320
Have you finished eating?

203
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,080
I looked at his back as he turned away,

204
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:40,030
and I hated it.

205
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:41,950
I hated them.

206
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,840
I hate them for sacrificing me

207
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,030
and not having any pity for me.

208
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,440
Not at all.

209
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,320
You went to the province
to see Liu Dazhi

210
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,510
and someone else, right?

211
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,360
You know about this, too?

212
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:17,510
I went to see Jiang Chao.

213
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,510
He works for a pharmaceutical company.

214
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:22,790
I wanted him

215
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,720
to get a specialist for Toto.

216
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,080
Jiang Chao

217
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,840
is my first love.

218
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,750
He proposed to me,

219
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,910
his parents were very nice to me,

220
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,510
and he loved me very much.

221
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,910
That's the closest I ever got
to happiness.

222
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,240
When I stood in front of him again,

223
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,030
I felt

224
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,390
so inferior,

225
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,390
living a life of shame.

226
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,510
This building is so tall.

227
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,510
Mom, can I go up there?

228
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,870
Uncle said only a princess
would live that high up

229
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,870
and have a prince come to rescue her.

230
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:31,960
Liu Yingying.

231
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,720
I'm sorry to bother you.

232
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,030
How can I help you?

233
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,840
I heard you work

234
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,320
with hospitals.

235
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,200
My daughter is sick.

236
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:51,600
I need you to get me a specialist.

237
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,550
What illness?

238
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,320
Leukemia.

239
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,600
Did you do the matching?

240
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,550
I'm not a match.

241
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,440
And the kid's dad didn't match either?

242
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:02,600
Jiang Chao.

243
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,960
This is my college friend, Liu Yingying.

244
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,480
She wants me to get her a specialist.

245
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,200
Nice to meet you.

246
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,240
I'll let you know
when I've arranged for a doctor.

247
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,200
Thank you.

248
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,510
Duoduo.

249
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:17,080
Come on, say goodbye to Aunt and Uncle.

250
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,840
Goodbye.

251
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:19,910
Thank you.

252
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,150
Liu Yingying,

253
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,150
the treatment of this illness is costly.

254
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,750
Take this money.

255
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,630
No, thanks.

256
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,790
Is she

257
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,510
your ex-girlfriend from college?

258
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,790
The me right now

259
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,320
is not Liu Yingying.

260
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,840
And the cause of all this

261
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,670
is Liu Sancheng

262
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,480
and Liu Dazhi.

263
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,720
Even so,

264
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,920
I hadn't made up my mind.

265
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,070
Why?

266
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,790
Because I still had Duoduo.

267
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,070
The doctor in the province said

268
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:23,880
that Duoduo can be saved.

269
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,510
If I have another child,

270
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,640
she can be saved.

271
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:33,750
[Pinghai Hospital]

272
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,880
Your hospital's diagnosis is correct,

273
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,510
and the treatment plan is appropriate.

274
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,160
Did you do the matching?

275
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,240
Yes.

276
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,110
There's no match.

277
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,310
You're the expert.

278
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:03,270
Is there anything you can do
to save my daughter?

279
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,680
In this child's case,

280
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,030
a bone marrow transplant
is the best course of action.

281
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:16,480
Thank you.

282
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,360
Duoduo, let's go. Come on.

283
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,720
Miss,

284
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,310
you're still young.

285
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,550
Have you thought
about having another child?

286
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,200
Duoduo,

287
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,830
have some water.

288
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:05,310
Hello.

289
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,750
Yingying, where did you take Duoduo?

290
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:08,750
It's been a whole day.

291
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,720
I brought Toto to the province
to see the doctor.

292
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,640
If there's nothing else,
I'll hang up now.

293
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,400
But...

294
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,110
The phone you have called is turned off,

295
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,000
please try again later.

296
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,000
Sorry,

297
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,070
the phone you have called is turned off,

298
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,310
please try again later.

299
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:40,960
Mom,

300
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,160
was that a call from Uncle?

301
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:43,720
Yes.

302
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,160
Mom, I miss my uncle.

303
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,880
I want to go home.

304
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:58,830
Duoduo,

305
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,400
wait here for me.

306
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,000
Duoduo,

307
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,110
I want to go home, too.

308
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,480
I'll take you home.

309
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,440
Let's go.

310
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,160
Mom.

311
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,920
Aren't you tired?

312
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:02,920
No.

313
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,110
I wanted to save Duoduo.

314
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,550
I had decided

315
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,960
to face Wang Liang again.

316
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:19,750
He shouldn't have pushed me
at that point.

317
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,400
At that point?

318
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,030
Who's he?

319
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,750
Who pushed you?

320
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:34,750
Liu Sancheng.

321
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,350
On the day you started

322
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,960
to re-investigate the case,

323
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,310
he called me home.

324
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,200
Why did you call me back?

325
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,070
Say what you have to say.

326
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,310
Duoduo hasn't been well lately.

327
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,920
I'm going back to take care of her.

328
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,160
Wang Liang can no longer be spared.

329
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,510
What did you say?

330
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:07,510
The police are back
to investigate that case from then.

331
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,240
I'm afraid Wang Liang can't resist.

332
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,720
We need to get rid of him.

333
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,240
He can't die.

334
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,440
Why?

335
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,590
Don't you always loathe him?

336
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,160
Don't you hate him?

337
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,960
He's ruined your life.

338
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,480
If we get rid of Wang Liang,

339
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,110
our family

340
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,070
will be safe from him forever,

341
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,510
and you'll be freed.

342
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,510
I'm pregnant.

343
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:38,270
Do you

344
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,510
have feelings for Wang Liang now?

345
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,640
What's going on?

346
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,480
The doctor said
that if we have another baby,

347
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,880
we might be able to save Duoduo.

348
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:53,750
Siblings have a higher success rate.

349
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,400
Are you crazy?

350
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,680
I'm not.

351
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,200
It's the last way to save Duoduo.

352
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,790
I want to save her.

353
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:03,240
Do you see Duoduo's condition now?

354
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,590
Can she wait until then?

355
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,440
I don't care.

356
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,240
I just want to save her.

357
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,200
Fine.

358
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,960
You don't have to care about it.

359
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,030
But Wang Liang must die.

360
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:20,350
Yingying,

361
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,110
kill him

362
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,680
for me.

363
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:31,830
Me?

364
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:35,750
You work in a hospital.

365
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:38,720
You have a lot of ways
of killing people without bloodshed.

366
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,000
As soon as the police came
to investigate,

367
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,790
Wang Liang's dead.

368
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,200
Do you think the police won't find me?

369
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,640
They will get me for sure.

370
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:51,830
They won't?

371
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,200
What if they will?

372
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,920
Even if they catch you,
it's a light sentence,

373
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,070
not a death sentence

374
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,070
because you're pregnant.

375
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,030
If Wang Liang is still alive,

376
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,550
he's a bomb

377
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,160
that could explode
at any time to our family.

378
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,750
Sooner or later,
the police will get to him.

379
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,680
Go to the hospital and get some drug

380
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,160
to make him die without a trace.

381
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,160
Does my brother know about this?

382
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,310
We can't let him know.

383
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,350
He can't be involved in this anymore.

384
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,680
He's the one who did it.

385
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,480
Why should I be involved?

386
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,830
Look, it's been so many years.

387
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:48,680
We're a family, why do you bother?

388
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,270
Look,

389
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:53,240
your brother
has a great future ahead of him,

390
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,510
and you want it to be ruined?

391
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,510
Say no more.

392
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,350
You have to do this.

393
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,640
Then why don't you do it?

394
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:06,160
You think I haven't thought about it?

395
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,480
If I do it,

396
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,350
the police will still suspect
your brother following me.

397
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:15,830
But if you do it,

398
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,590
they'll think
it's a quarrel between you couple.

399
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:21,070
No, what are you doing?

400
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:22,920
Will you do it?

401
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,270
Even though I've known
since I was a child

402
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:29,270
that I was adopted by Liu Sansheng,

403
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,480
he shouldn't have done this to me.

404
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,830
He wanted me to die.

405
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,830
I felt like there was fire burning

406
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,240
in my heart.

407
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,400
I'd like to know

408
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:47,200
what he thought my life was worth.

409
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,110
Has he ever thought

410
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,270
about the father-daughter bond?

411
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,110
No.

412
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,110
Never.

413
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,590
If that's the case,

414
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,160
why should I go soft?

415
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,830
If he wanted me dead,

416
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,270
I wanted him dead, too.

417
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:44,070
They come here every spring.

418
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:51,640
I asked the swallows why they came,

419
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,400
and they said...

420
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,550
Uncle, you're back.

421
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,550
Go to sleep.

422
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:00,960
Duoduo,

423
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,270
Get some sleep, will you?

424
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,160
I'll be right back.

425
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,000
Good girl.

426
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,920
Where did you take Duoduo?

427
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,030
She's so sick,

428
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,550
and you won't let her stay
in the hospital.

429
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,830
My dad told me to kill you.

430
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,240
Because the police came to investigate?

431
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:52,720
Yes.

432
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,000
He doesn't trust you.

433
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,030
He told me to kill you.

434
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,160
Then why are you telling me?

435
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,310
I don't want you dead.

436
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,350
I want you to kill them for me.

437
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:07,920
Kill my dad

438
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,590
and Dazhi.

439
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:15,790
Yingying,

440
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:17,750
this...

441
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,400
Don't worry.

442
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:22,310
I'll talk to Dad.

443
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,400
I'll tell Dad I'd never tell a soul
about that.

444
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,160
He won't listen to anything you say.

445
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,790
Either you die or he does.

446
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,030
Will you help me?

447
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,400
You should listen to Dad.

448
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,110
Get rid of me.

449
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:51,240
I grew up with no one to care for me,
no one to love me,

450
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,440
and I've thought of him
as my dad for a long time.

451
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,310
Don't you get it?

452
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,640
He told me to kill you.

453
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,680
He wants you dead.

454
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,000
Yingying,

455
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,030
I can't bring myself to do it.

456
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
You're such a loser.

457
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,270
He takes you for a piece of rotten meat,

458
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,790
but you really take him for your dad?

459
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:28,640
If you want to die,

460
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,830
why didn't you die earlier?

461
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:32,790
If you die now,

462
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,790
won't the police find that I killed you?

463
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:38,070
You torture me when you're alive

464
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:40,550
and then drag me along with you
when you're dead.

465
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,550
I'll take my own life.

466
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,720
I won't drag you in.

467
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,400
You've already dragged me in long ago.

468
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:56,200
From the day you forced my dad
to give me to you,

469
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,920
you've dragged me into this.

470
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:03,790
Yingying.

471
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,350
I'm sorry for what happened before.

472
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,830
I... This...

473
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:12,790
No. It's none...

474
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,310
It's none of Dad's business.

475
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,070
I...

476
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,590
I really love you.

477
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,790
You love me?

478
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,440
Then kill them for me.

479
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,350
I can't do it.

480
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,270
I can't do it, Yingying.

481
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:34,750
Don't be like this.

482
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,400
I can't do it, huh?

483
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,550
I'll do it myself.

484
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:42,960
Yingying,

485
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,200
he's your dad.

486
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:46,790
He isn't.

487
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,920
He's ruined my life.

488
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,000
He doesn't deserve to be a father.

489
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,030
Yingying, calm down.

490
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,960
There's got to be a way out of this.

491
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,000
I'm pregnant.

492
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,440
How did you convince Wang Liang?

493
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,880
How could he not say yes?

494
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,000
I'm carrying his child again.

495
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,550
He wouldn't let me take the risk
on my own.

496
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:50,830
He did

497
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:54,000
all these things for me.

498
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,510
It's all for me.

499
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,640
Was it you

500
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,480
or Wang Liang

501
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,000
who killed Liu Sancheng?

502
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,510
In fact, I know

503
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,070
that if I say he killed him,

504
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,790
you won't be able to find out the truth.

505
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,510
There's no evidence.

506
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,830
I didn't kill him myself,

507
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,240
so my offense is mitigated.

508
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,200
At least I can stay alive.

509
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:30,200
If I say I killed him,

510
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,880
I killed my dad with my own hands,

511
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,590
even the gods can't save my life.

512
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,680
Officer Chen,

513
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,030
Wang Liang killed him.

514
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,550
Don't forget to add it to the dish.

515
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:58,830
Do we really have to do this?

516
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,550
Act according to the plan.

517
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:04,400
After I kill him,

518
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,400
just throw the body
into the furnace for me.

519
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,440
All you have to do is stay here

520
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,680
and be my alibi.

521
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,590
That's it.

522
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,680
The rest is none of your business.

523
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:49,920
Yingying,

524
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,200
he raised you, after all.

525
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,680
If you kill him yourself,

526
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,000
what will you do
for the rest of your life?

527
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,070
Can you really bring yourself to do it?

528
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,630
Is there really no other way?

529
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:15,840
No.

530
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,280
He forced me to do it.

531
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:37,550
Dad.

532
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,150
Why are you here?

533
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,800
Yingying asked me to pick you up.

534
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,480
Why aren't you on duty?

535
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,480
I'll go later.

536
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:06,920
How is Yingying doing?

537
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,480
I'm hurt to see Yingying

538
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:13,960
in pain.

539
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:21,670
What are you doing?

540
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:25,760
Dad,

541
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,230
you gave me a family

542
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,920
and now it's falling apart.

543
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,110
It wasn't yours in the first place,

544
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,190
but you insisted.

545
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,800
In the end, you still can't keep it.

546
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,480
Dad,

547
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:54,360
it was you who took me out of Luoche,

548
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,230
but have you ever

549
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,000
really adored me

550
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:03,110
and loved me?

551
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:12,320
I adored you,

552
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,440
I loved you.

553
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,760
But how did you repay me?

554
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:21,630
Feel your conscience.

555
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,230
But I really wanted to help you

556
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,230
for the sake of our family.

557
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:30,030
But you forced me and threatened me

558
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,710
to make Yingying a hostage for you.

559
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,840
Was that a threat?

560
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:36,070
Then why would I give Yingying,
who went to college,

561
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:36,880
to a vagrant

562
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,480
like you who is illiterate?

563
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,280
If it wasn't for you,

564
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:47,670
Yingying would have found a good job
in the province

565
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:49,030
and married a good man.

566
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:51,880
You've ruined Yingying and our family.

567
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:54,840
Dad,

568
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,510
if I leave Yingying

569
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:01,760
and leave this family now,

570
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,880
will you forgive me?

571
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:18,320
It's too late.

572
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:16,320
For me,

573
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:21,110
he killed the man he always took
to be his father.

574
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,800
Wang Liang,

575
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:27,550
a man

576
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,360
I've never looked up to

577
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:31,800
has done everything for me,

578
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,710
no matter that he should
or should not have done.

579
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,920
He's silly.

580
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:41,320
Who can prove you're telling the truth?

581
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:45,550
You put the blame of murder
on Wang Liang

582
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,880
just to clear your name?

583
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,110
Why should I clear my name?

584
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:55,920
Whether it's killing Liu Sancheng
or Liu Dazhi,

585
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,320
it's all my order.

586
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,880
If I didn't order it,

587
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,400
Wang Liang wouldn't have done it.

588
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,230
Can my name still be cleared?

589
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:05,760
Wang Liang killed
your adoptive father for you,

590
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,400
the fire in your heart
should be extinguished.

591
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,710
Why did you still want
to kill your brother?

592
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:13,920
When your adoptive mother died,

593
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,710
you were eight and he was six.

594
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,800
You also said

595
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,150
your brother grew up on your back.

596
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,320
How could you bring yourself to do that?

597
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,510
Yes.

598
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,400
After Liu Sancheng died,

599
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,110
the fire in my heart was extinguished.

600
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:31,920
And I didn't dislike Wang Liang

601
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,710
as much as before.

602
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,150
I sometimes thought

603
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,710
there might be a possibility.

604
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,510
If we could get through this safely,

605
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,710
we'd go our separate ways,

606
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:50,320
and I wouldn't kill Liu Dazhi.

607
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:52,030
Anyway,

608
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:57,030
Liu Dazhi forced me to do it.

609
00:41:58,590 --> 00:41:59,960
He came out of the police station

610
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,510
and said you'd let him go

611
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,630
and that he wanted to leave immediately.

612
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,960
I went to the hotel to see him.

613
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,000
I just thought
that since things have come

614
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,320
to this point,

615
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:15,710
there's something

616
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:19,280
to be said.

617
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:25,030
What do you mean? You're leaving?

618
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:31,440
Okay, I got it.

619
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:36,590
Wang,

620
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:38,510
please tell the head nurse

621
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:40,510
that I have a family emergency
and I need to take some time off.

622
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:41,880
Okay, Yingying.

623
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,030
You're leaving?

624
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:51,510
Did they find the murderer?

625
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,760
I wonder if they're up to their job.

626
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,190
Who?

627
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,030
Wang Liang.

628
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:01,320
Wang Liang!

629
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:04,760
Do you suspect Wang Liang?

630
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:08,230
Who else could it be but Wang Liang?

631
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,190
He's the only one who knows
what happened back then.

632
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:11,360
He even dared to kill Dad.

633
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,590
He's going to kill me next.

634
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,840
If I don't leave,
shall I wait for my death here?

635
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,710
What am I going to do if you leave?

636
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:30,320
We

637
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:33,320
need to silence Wang Liang.

638
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,070
Silence him?

639
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:37,510
How?

640
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:43,630
We must find a way
to get rid of Wang Liang.

641
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,360
Yingying, we have to find a way
to get rid of Wang Liang.

642
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:48,320
Who's going to do it?

643
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:51,190
You go and kill him?

644
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,590
Are you kidding me?

645
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:55,710
I don't want to get my hands dirty.

646
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:00,190
Aren't your hands dirty enough?

647
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,400
Yingying, you work in a hospital.

648
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:18,280
You have a lot of ways
of killing people without bloodshed.

649
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:21,710
Think of something.

650
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,400
It was a hindrance when Dad was around,

651
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:31,440
but now he's dead.

652
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,510
If Wang Liang is dead too,

653
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:37,550
we'll be safe.

654
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:40,190
You don't like Wang Liang either.

655
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,360
If he's dead,

656
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,110
you can find someone you like

657
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:47,360
and have an adorable child.

658
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:53,360
The police are working hard on the case.

659
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:55,710
What if I'm caught?

660
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,030
That's impossible.

661
00:44:57,710 --> 00:44:58,920
It's been so many days since Dad died.

662
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:01,110
We can both guess who did it.

663
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:02,110
They can't.

664
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:04,800
If you're caught,

665
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:06,630
you're a woman.

666
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:10,320
A daughter avenging her father's death

667
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,550
won't get a heavy sentence.

668
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,280
That's what you think?

669
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:21,710
You're not going
to spill the beans on me, are you?

670
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,550
I don't know.

671
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:28,840
I don't know.

672
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:33,110
Yingying,

673
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:37,800
you've watched me grow up.

674
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:39,510
You've sacrificed so much

675
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:40,760
for me to have a good future.

676
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:43,320
If you reveal it now,

677
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,550
all the sacrifices you've made
will be for nothing.

678
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,800
You just want me

679
00:45:48,110 --> 00:45:49,510
to take the fall all by myself,

680
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:51,000
don't you?

681
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,480
No. What's the difference

682
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,590
between one person and two?

683
00:45:56,110 --> 00:45:57,150
No difference?

684
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:02,550
Fine.

685
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:04,070
Forget I said that.

686
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:05,670
I'm leaving this afternoon.

687
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,110
I'd advise you not to stay either.

688
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:07,960
You can't leave.

689
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,110
If you step out of this door,

690
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:11,480
I'll go to the police.

691
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,150
Are you sick?

692
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:19,070
What do you want?

693
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,150
Do you want everyone to get killed?

694
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,840
I'll think about what to do
with Wang Liang.

695
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,070
You stay here for a couple of days
and wait for my update.

696
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,320
How did Ding Baoyuan get involved
with you guys?

697
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:07,840
Ding Baoyuan

698
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,590
thought everything through in prison

699
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,710
and made a plan.

700
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:22,030
He's going to kill everyone
who had anything to do with the case.

701
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:25,440
Liu Dazhi,

702
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,110
Liu Sancheng,

703
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:29,190
Wang Liang,

704
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,320
Sun Caiyun,

705
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:32,710
Guan Qiao

706
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:34,760
and me.

707
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,670
Even though he knew
I had nothing to do with it,

708
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,320
he thought it wouldn't do any good
to keep me around,

709
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:44,920
so he had to kill me.

710
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:49,280
Why did Ding Baoyuan
make up with you guys?

711
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:52,800
How could it be?

712
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,190
The first person he wanted to kill

713
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:56,070
was Wang Liang .

714
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,960
but we caught him.

715
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:03,070
We negotiated with him.

716
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:06,230
As long as he killed Liu Dazhi for us,

717
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:08,110
we'd let him go.

718
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,630
We're just using each other.

719
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:14,510
But we knew in our hearts

720
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:17,480
that he wouldn't let us go.

721
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,190
I made the plan.

722
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:27,440
Liu Dazhi

723
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,440
was very paranoid.

724
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:35,760
He's hard to get close to.

725
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,190
So

726
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:39,670
I planned to let him get out himself
and get killed.

727
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:41,510
Ding Baoyuan

728
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,400
would stop him and kill him.

729
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,840
Wang Liang ambushed
and killed Ding Baoyuan

730
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:49,030
before killing Sun Caiyun.

731
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:52,230
Were these all your orders?

732
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:57,550
Yes, it's me.

733
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:05,000
I should get going.

734
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,030
He should be expecting Dazhi by now.

735
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:10,510
Yingying,

736
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,320
if you regret it now,

737
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:14,710
it's not too late.

738
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:17,070
Just give Dazhi a call...

739
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:18,150
Go now.

740
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:38,880
Yingying.

741
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:40,480
Yingying.

742
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,440
Fu.

743
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:43,000
Yingying.

744
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:17,650
