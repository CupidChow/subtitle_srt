00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,670
I got back to the station after 10 PM.

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,110
When I got back,

3
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,720
I saw a person standing
by the coal pile,

4
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,320
sneaking around.

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,190
I thought she was stealing coal

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,920
and wanted to teach her a lesson.

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:22,920
So I went behind her

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,800
and grabbed the shovel next to her

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,350
and smacked her hard on the head.

10
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,000
She just fell over

11
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:32,320
and didn't move.

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,200
I stepped forward

13
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,000
and saw that it was a woman.

14
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,390
I checked to see if she was breathing,

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,200
but she didn't seem to be.

16
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,350
I was so scared.

17
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,880
I carried her on my back
into the furnace room

18
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,880
and stuffed her in the slag box.

19
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,710
I just wanted to teach her a lesson,

20
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,280
but I didn't intend to kill her.

21
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,710
I was trying to protect state property.

[Episode 2]

23
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:53,370
[2012, Kulu County]

24
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,520
Chen Jianghe,

25
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,400
come up here.

26
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,520
Officer Luo,

27
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,310
is that Chen Jianghe who just went up?

28
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,560
Why is he back?

29
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,800
Commissioner Liu asked him to come back.

30
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,470
How are you doing in Luoche?

31
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,470
I just can't figure out

32
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,120
why you don't want to come back
when you're transferred.

33
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,400
Get to the point.

34
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,590
You're still the same.

35
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,560
No wonder you can't get promoted.

36
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,360
If it wasn't for the fact that you
fell out with the old commissioner

37
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,160
because of Master's case

38
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,680
and had to go to Luoche,

39
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,600
you'd be a chief now at the very least.

40
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,160
Higher position, greater responsibility.

41
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,750
What's the point
of not doing anything for the people?

42
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,720
Stop being sarcastic with me.

43
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,680
It's been seven years since that case.

44
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,750
The authorities have assessed Master
as injured at work.

45
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,800
Why can't you get over it?

46
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,720
I drove three hours to get here

47
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,190
and you're telling me this? What for?

48
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:41,950
Tell me!

49
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,950
Why did you call me back
to review the case?

50
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,360
It's an order from the higher-ups.

51
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:46,920
Do you think I want to?

52
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,800
Qin, I heard from Commissioner Liu

53
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,720
that Captain Ge who was in charge
of the Furnace Homicide

54
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,870
isn't on the team anymore.

55
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,920
Where did he go?

56
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,190
Don't mention Captain Ge

57
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,360
in front of Chen Jianghe.

58
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,600
He'll devour you.

59
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,950
Is he that scary?

60
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,720
He went to Luoche because of his master.

61
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,870
If we let outsiders
investigate this case,

62
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,920
if they find out anything,

63
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,120
they'll say we've made a mistake,

64
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,560
and then who's to blame?

65
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,310
Us.

66
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:28,950
So I thought...

67
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,120
Firstly, I didn't agree
to be transferred back.

68
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,950
Secondly, there's nothing wrong
with this case.

69
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:33,950
Ding Baoyuan's the murderer.

70
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,800
Thirdly, reviewing the case is...

71
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,270
What?

72
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:39,950
What's the third?

73
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:40,830
Go ahead.

74
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,920
You're the superior now.

75
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,800
We need to keep our distance.

76
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,310
You're a wimp.

77
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,360
That's what the municipal authority
told me.

78
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:58,600
Let's do a serious
investigation ourselves.

79
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,720
When the comrades
from the Prosecutor's Office come,

80
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:02,510
right?

81
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,680
We'll be able
to tell them what happened.

82
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,720
What's that girl's background?

83
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,480
She's got a lot to say,

84
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,510
but she doesn't look like
she has much to offer.

85
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,120
You're capable.

86
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,510
Look at you.

87
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,120
You look like a sheep herder.

88
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:23,800
What's wrong with a sheep herder?

89
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,310
What's wrong with a cop who herds sheep?

90
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,920
You're so arrogant.

91
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,560
Listen, that girl is something.

92
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:31,950
She graduated

93
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,070
from Public Security University
as a postgraduate.

94
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,160
I've asked around,

95
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,720
she's solved some big cases
in the municipal office.

96
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,950
She was just involved, wasn't she?

97
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,270
Master solved a lot of cases,

98
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,800
I was involved in a few.

99
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,120
It's still a credit to her, right?

100
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,630
Why aren't you involved

101
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,480
in this review?

102
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,830
Do you think

103
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,070
Luo Yingwei is the only one
from the municipal office?

104
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,920
There's also Division Chief Wang.

105
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,920
Luo Yingwei is only responsible
for investigation and running errands.

106
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,360
Division Chief Wang

107
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,720
asked me for an office
as soon as he arrived.

108
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,120
He's been reviewing case files there
every day.

109
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,120
I have to keep him company.

110
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:07,870
Tell me,

111
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,680
can you cooperate
with Luo Yingwei's investigation?

112
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,190
Can you take care of this case?

113
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,070
No, I can't.

114
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,830
I'm just a cop who herds sheep.
What can I do?

115
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,120
Are you kidding me?

116
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:17,950
Fine.

117
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,510
Then you don't do it.

118
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,800
Let an outsider do it.

119
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,120
Let Master have his regrets.

120
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,680
What regrets does Master have?

121
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,920
Madam Wang took Master home
from the hospital.

122
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,160
You don't know that?

123
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,000
Why did she take him home?

124
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,680
Madam Wang said she wants
to stop his treatment.

125
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,510
Can you do it?

126
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,120
No wonder you can be a leader.

Ma?

129
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,950
What do you mean, Commissioner Liu?

130
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,800
Why did you ask him to review the case?

131
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,390
Don't you remember
how Master met the accident back then?

132
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,310
If he comes back,

133
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,310
everyone in the team won't be happy.

134
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,870

Madam Wang, did you go grocery shopping?

138
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,550
You didn't even call.

139
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,270
I didn't know you were coming.

140

Lamb shanks from the pasture.

141
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,150
Last time, you brought him sheep's milk,

142

he looked good after drinking it.

143
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,150
Really?

144
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,480
That's great.

145
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,910
I was in a hurry this time.
I'll bring it next time.

146
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,000
Okay.

147
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:50,080
How many days will you be here?

148
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,200

Look who's here.

151
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,080
You can stay here
for a couple of days.

152
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,910
The room next door is always empty.

153
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,480
No.

154
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,910
I've been transferred back
to work for a while.

155
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,080
I'll go home and clean up.

156
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,120
Come on.

157
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,960
Look who's here.

158
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,080
Okay, I'll make dinner,

00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,910
and you talk to him.

160
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,120
Then we'll have dinner together.

161
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,480
Madam Wang, let me cook.

162
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,440
I'm a good cook now.

163
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,510
Tonight, I'll make lamb stew.

164
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,720
Really? I'll try it.

165
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:36,510
Okay.

166
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,910
Why did you bring Master back
from the hospital?

167
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,080
The department doesn't want
to pay for the medical expenses?

168
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,720
No, don't you think so.

169
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,000
The department took good care
of your master

170
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,550
during the years he has been in bed.

171
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,510
I insisted on bringing him back.

172
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,790
Just think how convenient
it is to be at home.

173
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,790
Besides, your master's greatest fear

174
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,670
is to cause trouble to others.

175
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,320
Master's been in the hospital for years.

176
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,360
He's not as fit as he used to be.

177
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,150
If anything happens,

178
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,510
it'll be better to stay in the hospital.

179
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,510
You're getting old.

180
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,870
We're fine. Don't worry about us.

181
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,120
Your master has been in bed

182
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,750
for seven or eight years.

183
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,910
I feel sorry for him

184
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,320
sometimes.

185
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,600
Do you think he can stand to be idle?

186
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,910
So I just came home.

187
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,480
It's more convenient.

188
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,910
I'll stay with him.

189
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:49,080
If he can't make it one day,

190
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,270
it's his destiny.

191
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,030
You have to get your work
and life in order.

192
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,150
You've got important things to do.

193
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,150
Come and see him when you're free.

194
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,720
If you're busy, you don't have
to come here all the time.

195
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,790
I'll feed him.

196
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,120
It's time to eat.

197
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,480
What's so great about this thing?

198
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,240
Come on, here you go.

199
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,910
It makes you happy to smell it.

200
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,960
Eat more if you're happy today.

201
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:13,120
[Conference room]

202
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,150
Hello, Sirs.

203
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,390
I'd like to talk
about Comrade Ge Dajie's

204
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,030
work injury assessment.

205
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:19,910
Jianghe,

206
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,550
we're meeting right now
to look into this.

207
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,790
Go out and wait for the news.

208
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,960
I'll tell you what I think, what I feel.

209
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,840
Comrade Ge Dajie had been working

210
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,000
diligently for 28 years.

211
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,360
In his life, he cares most
about his reputation.

212
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,360
He spared no effort

213
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,440
in training us young officers.

214
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,750
I'm sure he was out

215
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:49,150
on duty that day.

216
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,150
Chen Jianghe,

217
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,030
how can you prove
that your master, Ge Dajie,

218
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,440
didn't go out that day
for personal reasons?

219
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,550
I remember it was 23rd June.

220
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,390
As soon as I entered the office,
I saw Master

221
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,910
looking through old case files.

222
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,870
He must have found out something new

223
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,630
before rushing out.

224
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,720
Liu,

225
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,720
when your master went out that day,

226
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,720
he said the word "banquet".

227
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,600
You remember that, don't you?

228
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,600
He may have

229
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,030
said that,

230
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,910
or I may have misheard him.

231
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,200
If you heard it, you heard it.

232
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,550
Did you hear it or not?

233
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,750
There couldn't be a banquet.

234
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,200
I looked it up.

235
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,630
The 23rd of June
wasn't an auspicious day

236
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:38,440
or a festival

237
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,150
or anything.

238
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,720
According to local custom,

239
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,750
if it's a banquet or celebration,

240
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:43,840
an auspicious day

241
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,360
will be chosen.

242
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,510
Right? Everybody knows that.

243
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,360
Chen Jianghe,

244
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,910
you went out with your master that day.

245
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,320
You know best
what your master was doing.

246
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,720
Tell us then.

247
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,360
Whatever you want.

248
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,030
Don't tell the kids yet.

249
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,630
I agree.

250
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:28,720
You're on leave.

251
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:30,630
Let's drink.

252
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,870
Listen,

253
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,150
I've read the department's decision.

254
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,240
Don't take it personally.

255
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,960
The superior wants you
to make your own choice.

256
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:54,790
Listen to me,

257
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,750
go to the police station in town,

258
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,440
don't go to Luoche.

259
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,360
What for?

260
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:01,910
What's wrong with going to Luoche?

261
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,870
What are you doing there? Herding sheep?

262
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,750
What's wrong with herding sheep?
Can't I herd sheep?

263
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,360
Master's work injury assessment
is still pending.

264
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,960
The higher-ups
haven't decided anything yet.

265
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,030
We can fight for it.

266
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,600
Besides,

267
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,960
Our master has been a cop all his life.

268
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,030
Many years.

269
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,390
Commissioner Chen, Commissioner Tian,
Commissioner Wei,

270
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,450
all of them know who our master is.

271
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:33,630
Chen,

272
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,480
listen to me.

273
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,360
Don't get upset and get worked up

274
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,510
with the authorities.

275
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,720
You were so happy the other day

276
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,030
that you're going to the province.

277
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,720
Once you're punished,

278
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,550
you can't stand it anymore
and go to Luoche.

279
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,240
Can you calm down, please?

280
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,390
I'm emotionally stable.

281
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,750
Of course you have
to fight for Master's rights.

282
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,960
Stay out of my business.

283
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,720
You're the Acting Detachment Chief now.

284
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,550
Everyone is watching
what you say and do.

285
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:07,400
Do me a favour.

286
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,240
Go ahead.

287
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,750
Master's car is about to be scrapped.

288
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,030
I want to drive it.

289
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,550
Okay.

290
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,590
Chen.

291
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:03,200
Roasted whole lamb
from Luoche awaits me!

292
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,510
He's got a temper.

293
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:15,070
It's good for him to go there
to curb his temper.

294
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,790
Big Brother, I'm hungry.

295
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,440
What a fool.

296
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,160
You're always hungry.

297
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,960
You're a stone monkey.
Of course you're not hungry.

298
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,440
Master!

299
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:57,750
Master!

301
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,790
I'm right on time.

302
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,030
Not a second late.

303
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,720
This table's unoccupied, isn't it?

304
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,440
Zhang Yuan,

305
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:00,750
come here.

306
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,350
Document this information.

307
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:06,960
Okay.

308
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,510
Any work arrangements for today?

309
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,720
The case doesn't need to be reviewed?

310
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,310
The heater's not working.

311
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,400
Are they generating the heat

312
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,680
at the heating station?

313
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:46,640
Ma, is it always this cold every winter?

314
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,920
We have to wear coats in this room.

315
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,030
Let's go to the heating station.

316
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,680
Me?

317
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,830
Do you have time?

318
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,350
I'll cooperate with your work.

319
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:02,310
Li Rui, get Chen a computer.

320
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,720

321
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,030
No outsiders are allowed in here.

Manager Wang?

324
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,350
Wait a minute.

325
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,830
How many people work in this factory?

326
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,550
Over 2,300 back then,

327
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,960
but I don't know now.

328
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,720
Mr. Chen, what brings you here?

329
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,160
You've become a manager now.

330
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,590
Don't mention it.

331
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,920
There are only seven or eight of us.

332
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:12,110
Now, there's an assistant manager, Yang.

333
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,550
It's easier now than it used to be.

334
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,720
We both take turns on duty.

335
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,030
Please come in.

336
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,830
Do you have a child?

337
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,000
No.

338
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,790
A daughter or a son?

339
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,790
No.

340
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,920
No kids or not married?

341
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,750
Neither.

342
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,200
You're a manager now.

343
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,550
You don't have a serious relationship?

344
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,920
I haven't met the right one yet.

345
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,830
You're 28 years old, other people's
kids are already running around.

00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,960
Hurry up!

347
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,160
It's a matter of fate.

348
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,160
It can't be forced.

349
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,960
Has this place changed
since eight years ago?

350
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,550
Let me introduce her to you.

351
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,720
This is Officer Luo
from the municipal office.

352
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:50,070
Officer Luo.

353
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:50,750
Hi.

354
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,400
Hi, Officer Luo.

355
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,030
Nothing's changed.

356
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,070
Same as before.

357
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,720
The furnace is running most of the year,

358
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,750
and the rest of the time, we're back
at the factory doing something else.

359
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,160
Has the furnace been replaced?

360
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,440
No.

361
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:04,350
We don't get the money
to replace the furnace.

362
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:09,400
It's rare for thornapple
to bloom at this time of year.

363
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,310
How did you raise it?

364
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,550
The temperature here is high.

365
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,160
Ding Baoyuan appealed.

366
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:18,200
We need to review this case again.

367
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,960
Why would he appeal?

368
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,640
Don't ask about that.

369
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,920
You go and get the seven men
from back then...

370
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,350
No, there's a Ding Baoyuan in jail.

371
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,720
Call the other six here.

372
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,160
Let's start from the beginning.

373
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:38,350
Manager Wang,

374
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,590
get your men to call them here.

375
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,720
It's my first time here.
Please show me around.

376
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,110
Okay.

377
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,440
Erbao, Wang, come here.

378
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,000
Go and get

379
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
the veterans from the station.

380
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,030
Eight years ago.

381
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,440
Eight years ago.

382
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,160
Okay.

383
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:54,960
Mr. Chen.

384
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,790
After taking over at 9 PM,

385
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:59,750
I played chess with my master
in the duty room.

386
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,720
It's been fine all night.

387
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,510
But in the morning,

388
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,550
a body fell out of there.

389
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,310
I was terrified.

390
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,510
I couldn't work nights after that.

391
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:10,880
It took me a long time to get over it.

392
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:17,240
Mr. Chen.

393
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,510
Chen, take off your sunglasses.

394
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,720
Why are you wearing sunglasses indoor?

395
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,400
What's this?

396
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,550
Coal loader.

397
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,240
Once it's filled with coal,

398
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,310
it'll feed itself in 15 minutes.

399
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,350
We can leave it alone for five hours.

400
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:45,160
So why did you say
your superiors don't care?

401
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,830
It's not provided by the superiors.
We did it ourselves.

402
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:49,830
Who did?

403
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,960
I simply made it.

404
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,680
You?

405
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,030
I remember you're illiterate.

406
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:57,590
You haven't been to school
for a few days. You're amazing now.

407
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,550
Manager Wang.

408
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:04,960
Luo, just call me Wang Liang.
Don't call me manager.

409
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,550
Wang Liang,

410
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,590
has this door position changed?

411
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,590
No.

412
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,590
I've read the case files
from back in the day.

413
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:12,510
The lights in and out
of here were on

414
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:13,480
throughout the night of the murder?

415
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:16,240
It's lit as long as it's loaded
with coal.

416
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,440
That's strange.

417
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,200
It's less than 20 metres from this door

418
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,920
to the duty room.

419
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,310
Someone carried a person in,

420
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,920
and none of you noticed?

421
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,510
I thought it was strange then, too.

422
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,640
I had my back to the door.

423
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,240
My master was facing the door,

424
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:33,750
but we were focused
on our game of chess.

425
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,110
He lost three in a row to me

426
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,270
and he's pissed off.

427
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,880
You're so focused, huh?

428
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:45,310
Manager, Mr. Wang
and Mr. Li have arrived.

429
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,400
The others aren't here yet.

430
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,310
You tell them to wait in the duty room.

431
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,270
Okay.

432
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,880
Mr. Liu, you're here.
They're all in the duty room.

433
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,480
Okay.

434
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:00,920
Where's Wang Liang?

435
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,550
Manager is in the furnace room.

436
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,270
What's wrong, Luo?

437
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,440
This is the coal inlet, isn't it?

438
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:11,960
Yes.

439
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,310
What about this one up here?

440
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,310
This one works
with the device underneath.

441
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,440
It wasn't there before, was it?

442
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,350
Yes.

443
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:23,000
What's that door for?

444
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,110
This door is usually used
for loading and unloading coal.

445
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,070
Is it open at night?

446
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,070
No.

447
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,720
There's no room to put a person
in the front coal inlet.

448
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,750
Look at this.

449
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,510
This coal goes in
through the front inlet

450
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:42,790
and ends up in the rear slag box.

451
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,680
Wang Liang,

452
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,070
open it.

453
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,720
Let Officer Luo take a look.

454
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:51,640
Show me.

455
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,880
Sorry, Officer Luo.

456
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,720
It hasn't been released
for over two hours.

457
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,750
Sorry.

458
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,720
Opening the rear slag box
is a technical job.

459
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,270
Are you all right?

460
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:23,790
You can't just stuff a person
in the rear slag box.

461
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:26,030
You've got to put them
on that conveyor belt

462
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:29,240
so the body can go round

463
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,640
the furnace with it.

464
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,790
We estimated the time back then.

465
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,830
It takes 1 hour and 45 minutes

466
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:41,790
for the coal to go in through the inlet

467
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,790
and fall onto this conveyor belt
and turn clockwise.

468
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,030
If it's put in
through the rear slag box,

469
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,790
it'll take twice as long

470
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:51,240
to go round clockwise

471
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,830
and fall back into the rear slag box.

472
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:55,510
That's three and a half hours.

473
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:58,310
The murderer probably didn't know

474
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,720
that the temperature
of the furnace wasn't high enough.

475
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,550
Three and a half hours
can only burn the body

476
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:02,920
to half a charcoal.

477
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,680
Mr. Liu, come in.

478
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,160
Liu Sancheng,
one of the workers back then.

479
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:16,160
Mr. Liu, this is Officer Luo
from the municipal office.

480
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,960
Hi.

481
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,160
We're here

482
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,160
to investigate that case again.

483
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,830
Tell Officer Luo about it.

484
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,200
What should I say?

485
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,160
I said it so many times.

486
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:32,790
It's been eight years.
Why are you bringing this up again?

487
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:35,720
Dad, Ding Baoyuan appealed inside

488
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,200
and said he didn't commit the murder.

489
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:39,030
Mr. Chen and his colleague
are just doing their work.

490
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,720
Let's just tell them everything we know.

491
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:44,270
Aren't you two master and apprentice?

492
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:47,160
I was brought up by my master.

493
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,440
So there's no difference
between Master and Dad.

494
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,400
And Master has taken me
as his godson.

495
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,070
What happened after the case was closed

496
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:56,160
is not in the case file.

497
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,590
Mr. Liu, tell us about it.

498
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,270
Well...

499
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,720
We were both playing chess
in the duty room.

500
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:08,160
It's been a quiet night.

501
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:10,550
But at dawn,

502
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,680
a body fell down.

503
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,160
I was so scared.

504
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,310
I asked Wang Liang to call the manager.

505
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,110
Then, the police came.

506
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,070
Yes.

507
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:28,240
Wang Liang, come out with me.

508
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,960
Is everyone here?

509
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,310
Everyone's there except Mr Li.

510
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,160
Rush him.

511
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,480
Okay.

512
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,070
Erbao.

513
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:57,590
Luo.

514
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,270
What did you call me for?

515
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,790
Why did you call Wang Liang out?

516
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,480
What's Liu Sancheng's reaction?

517
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,880
No reaction.

518
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,350
That's the trick
the municipal office uses

519
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,110
to solve cases?

520
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:17,200
And you solve cases by talking rubbish?

521
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,790
Wang Liang, I heard you're still single.

522
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:31,240
Why don't you ask your godfather
to be your father-in-law?

523
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,240
Yeah.

524
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,590
Liu, your daughter is still single.

525
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:37,110
I think she and Wang Liang
are a good match.

526
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,160
Dad.

527
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,590
I heard from my boy...

528
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,350
I have water here.

529
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:42,160
Recently, bonuses are enough...

530
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,550
Quiet, please.

531
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,480
This is Officer Chen.

532
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:47,880
You knew him from before.

533
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,750
This is Officer Luo.

534
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,200
They're here to learn
about the case back then.

535
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:53,030
Just say what you know.

536
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,310
Mr. Chen, shall we start?

537
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,480
I just have one small request.

538
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,440
Can we not smoke

539
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,680
during the meeting?

540
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,270
Okay.

541
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,200
Show some respect for the lady.

542
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,350
Okay.

543
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,440
Officer Luo, ask them anything you want.

544
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,240
You all wear uniforms
to work, don't you?

545
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:13,960
Yes, we do.

546
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,880
It's so dusty.

547
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,550
Yes, it's mandatory

548
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,640
to wear uniforms at work.

549
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,960
Are shoes provided uniformly?

550
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:24,240
Shoes are easy to spoil,

551
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,070
so if they get worn out,
we'll wear our own shoes.

552
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,310
But they're usually safety shoes.

553
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,550
Do you wear travel shoes

554
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,000
like these to work?

555
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,350
Pass it around.

556
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:40,640
These aren't cheap shoes.

557
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:43,880
Who wears these shoes?

558
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:48,200
Who wears such good shoes to work?

559
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:54,310
Any outsiders come into the
heating station at normal times?

560
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,270
For example, family members.

561
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:56,440
Coal thieves.

562
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,070
Yes, we have to watch out
for coal thieves at night.

563
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:01,750
During the day,

564
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,550
sometimes, people come looking
for someone or something,

565
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,680
so it's hard to tell.

566
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,200
Okay, so let's go to the police station

567
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,200
and talk about what happened
eight years ago.

568
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:17,110
What's with the photo
of the travel shoes?

569
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:19,510
Didn't the case file say

570
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:21,310
you found six sets of footprints
in the furnace room

571
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,350
back in the day?

572
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,750
There's only one small section
of sole prints

573
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,240
from the sixth set of footprints.

574
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,070
The damage at the crime scene
was quite serious.

575
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,160
And you had limited
technological means back then.

576
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,160
For this case review,

577
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,550
my colleagues at the municipal office

578
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:36,790
compared the travel shoes on the market

579
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:37,480
at the time.

580
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:40,960
The footprints and sole prints
of the travel shoes

581
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,000
match those
of the sixth set of footprints

582
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,960
to a high degree.

583
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,270
Can you confirm that?

584
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:51,720
Too few traces.

585
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:54,200
Shoe sizes and gender models
cannot be confirmed.

586
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,270
You said that for nothing.

587
00:33:58,750 --> 00:33:59,750
The workers said

588
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,350
they couldn't wear travel shoes to work.

589
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,000
That means

590
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,070
an outsider was
in the heating station at the time.

591
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,480
Chen, don't you think it's strange
that the master

592
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:25,510
and his apprentice
didn't notice anything

593
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,710
that night?

594
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,110
What's so strange?

595
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,510
It's less than 20 metres
from the duty room

596
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,590
to the back door.

597
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:32,760
The lights were always on.

598
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,510
A man carrying a body

599
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,920
passed almost right under their noses.

600
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,360
How could they not notice?

601
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,110
They were focused
on their game of chess.

602
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,550
If they didn't look up,
they might not have seen it.

603
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,440
The furnace's rumbling,

604
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:50,670
and there's a possibility
that they couldn't hear it.

605
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,550
What about the man carrying the body?

606
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:57,070
He knew there were two people sitting
in the room,

607
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,070
but he still had the guts to go inside.

608
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:02,510
There's only one explanation.

609
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,150
He knew

610
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,670
he didn't have to be afraid

611
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,030
even if he was seen.

612
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,150
That's why I think

613
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,710
the master and the apprentice
worked together.

614
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,150
That's impossible.

615
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,760
I told you.

616
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,760
If they worked together,

617
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,590
they'd have stuffed the body

618
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:23,000
right back in the furnace.

619
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,710
Why did they report to Ding Baoyuan?

620
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:28,000
Then why wasn't he afraid
of being exposed?

621
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,280
He had to take a risk.

622
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,510
I think it's strange anyway.

623
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,070
The master and apprentice

624
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,190
must be hiding something from us.

625
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,440
Which ward is Duoduo in?

626
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,230
What's her surname?

627
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,880
The kid with leukemia from Luoche.

628
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:18,760
Ward 307.

629
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,710
She hasn't been in therapy lately.

630
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:20,550
You may visit her.

631
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,480
Okay.

632
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:32,230
I asked the swallow why it came here,

633
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,920
and it said

634
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:37,230
the spring is the most beautiful here.

635
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:37,960
Duoduo.

636
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:40,280
Uncle Chen.

637
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,000
Why do you have a shaved head?

638
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:46,840
Are you cold?

639
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,710
Not at all. It's hot.

640
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:50,510
Really?

641
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,400
Have you eaten?

642
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,440
I haven't eaten anything.
I don't feel like it.

643
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,030
The food's not good here, is it?

644
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,150
Yes.

645
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,110
What to do? I'll buy you some.

646
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,760
By the way, Uncle Chen,
I'll tell you a secret.

647
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,840
Secret? What's it?

648
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,280
I want to be sick.
I don't want to get well.

649
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,920
You want to be sick
and don't want to get well?

650
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,400
I'm sick and my mum wants me.

651
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,400
Isn't that what you've been hoping for?

652
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,960
These flowers are so pretty.

653
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,880
Who bought them?

654
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,000
My uncle.

655
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,510
Your uncle bought them?

656
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,880
Yes, Uncle Chen.

657
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:31,070
Do you know that there is a flower
called devil's trumpet?

658
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:32,880
I don't.

659
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:35,360
There's a kind of devil's trumpet
that's black.

660
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,510
Have you seen it?

661
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:37,670
No.

662
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,760
Have you?

663
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,550
Duoduo.

664
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,590
Mum, hug me.

665
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,920
Come on.

666
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,110
Hi.

667
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,320
I am

668
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,400
Chen Jianghe. A cop from Luoche.

669
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,480
I'm here to visit Duoduo

670
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,800
with some supplements and sheep's blood.

671
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,110
Thank you.

672
00:37:58,590 --> 00:37:59,670
You're welcome.

673
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:05,590
Duoduo, I'm going to work.

674
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,030
I'll come back to see you
some other time.

675
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:13,000
I'll see Uncle Chen out.

676
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:13,880
Sit down.

677
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:27,110
How's Duoduo's condition now?

678
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:30,800
The doctor says
she doesn't have much time left.

679
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,590
Isn't leukemia curable in children?

680
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,840
How's the bone marrow search going?

681
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,360
There's no suitable donor.

682
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,280
I wasn't matched either.

683
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:45,590
Where's her father?

684
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,670
She doesn't have a father.

685
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:55,070
I met Duoduo in the village

686
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,840
in 2009.

687
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:00,190
Several times I saw Duoduo standing
on the grassland

688
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,570
and looking into the distance.

689
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,280
I asked who she was waiting for.

690
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,670
She said she was waiting for her mum
to pick her up and take her home.

691
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,550
If there's a financial problem
with the treatment,

692
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:15,070
I'll ask everyone at the police station
to think of a way out.

693
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:20,400

What are you doing? It's dirty.

696
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,590
Mum, it's sheep's blood.

697
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,800
It's not dirty.

698
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:40,800
Great-grandma made it for me.
It's delicious.

699

Good.

741
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:31,230

Ma.

745
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:48,230
You're familiar with Kulu.
Tell me about Liu Yingying.

746
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,800
This was your case back then.

747

Don't you know better than me?

748
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:52,800
Don't say that.

749
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,360
I've been away from Kulu
for seven years.

750
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,440
I can't remember.

751
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:59,070
That's true. Liu Yingying went
to college in the city.

752
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,070
She returned here

753
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,230

at the county hospital.

His wife, Sun Caiyun?

763
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,230
Yes. It's rare to find a wife like that.

764
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,230
Why would you say so?

765
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,030
She's been coming to every meeting day

766
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:18,630
since Ding Baoyuan's
second month in jail.

767

Why do you want
to interrogate him again?

Ding Baoyuan has appealed.

769
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:24,440
We need to re-investigate this case.

770
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:28,030
I've known him eight years,

771
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:29,030
and I think he's the murderer.

772
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:31,710
You have to base it
on something, don't you?

773

In our line of work,

not to say that we're 100% sure,

777

but pretty close.

778

From what I know of Ding Baoyuan,

779
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,590
if he didn't do it,

780
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,400
he wouldn't admit it.

What does he read?

793
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,440
Just a novel.

to school yesterday.

Because

808
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:13,070
they said I'm the son of a criminal.

809

and educated person.

824
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:01,550
you should fight.

838
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,360
to buy this book for him.

839
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:51,710
He asked you to buy it?

840

Suddenly, one day, he told us

844
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,710
he wanted to buy this book.

845
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:05,230
It's not against the rules.

846
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:08,190
We checked it before we brought it in,

847
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,920
and it seemed
to be just a literature book,

848
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,760
nothing special.

849
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,230

don't ever fight with your
classmates again, do you hear me?

866
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:55,510
Use your brain.

867
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,880
If you fight again,
you'll grow up and be brought here.
