1
00:00:59,150 --> 00:00:59,960
Master, you won.

[Sandstorm]
[Episode 11]

3
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,150
They are matched!

4
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,800
A duplicated one.

5
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,430
Yes.

6
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,910
Why does it need to be duplicated?

7
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,240
To steal coal.

8
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,190
Stealing coal?

9
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,240
But, why is it thrown
to be burnt in the furnace?

10
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,400
Maybe something shady was done.

11
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,190
Destroying evidence.

12
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,710
Hello, Kulu County Police Station.

13
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,520
Who is this speaking?

14
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,710
Police officer, I want to make a report.

15
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,630
My husband's name is Liu Dazhi.

16
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,120
He's from Kulu.

17
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,960
I think something happened
to my husband.

18
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,310
Didn't Liu Dazhi go back two days ago?

19
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:00,960
I'm not sure either.

20
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,080
But, I couldn't reach him.

21
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,520
Don't panic, please tell me slowly.

22
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,870
He didn't come back.

23
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,630
I...

24
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,560
A few days ago, he wanted to return.

25
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,240
But, I kept persuading him

26
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,080
that his father hadn't buried yet

27
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,160
and it would be better
to return after the funeral.

28
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,120
However,

29
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,600
he excitedly called me two days ago

30
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,720
saying he was coming back.

31
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,310
Then, after a while,

32
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,920
he called again,

33
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,920
telling me that there was
still something he hadn't settled

34
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,600
and couldn't come back yet.

35
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,000
I didn't think much of it.

36
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,870
At 6:00 PM the night before last,

37
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,870
he called me again...

38
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,000
He called me again,

39
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,040
saying he was on the way back.

40
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,560
But, before he finished speaking,
the call hung up.

41
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,510
I...

42
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,310
I didn't finish what I was saying before
it hung up, and I was apprehensive.

43
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,870
Then, I tried calling him twice more.

44
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,920
He picked up the first two times,

45
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,920
saying he was on his way back

46
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,870
and told me not to worry.

47
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,630
But,

48
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,720
I couldn't reach him anymore after that.

49
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,920
I thought maybe he had entered
a desert region and lost signal.

50
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,870
Then, I didn't think too much of it
and went to bed.

51
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,720
But then,

52
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,430
when I woke up,

53
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,560
I still couldn't reach him.

54
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,560
Police officer, do you think his car

55
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,000
might have broken down in the desert?

56
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,800
But...

57
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,680
But I waited all day,
and there's still no news from him.

58
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,560
I didn't know what to do.

59
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,190
I...

60
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,000
I called the police station
to make a report.

61
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,630
They let me contact you,

62
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,830
the Kulu County Police Station.

63
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,830
So I...

64
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,190
I got it. Don't worry.

65
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,480
We will start looking for him now.

66
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,720
Keep your phone on.

67
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,720
We'll stay in touch.

68
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,040
Thank you.

69
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,920
Chen.

70
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,310
I saw Liu Dazhi safely leave this town.

71
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,070
You told me to come back.

72
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,720
Could it be like his wife said?

73
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,800
The car broke down in the desert
and he lost the signal?

74
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,360
Something happened.

75
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,680
Immediately report it

76
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,870
to headquarters

77
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,870
and request support.

78
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,720
Keep close surveillance
on Wang Liang and Liu Yingying.

79
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,070
Extract Liu Dazhi's call records

80
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,720
from that day.

81
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,920
Get all the surveillance footage
along the route.

82
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:08,870
Got it.

83
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,310
Let's take action now. Hurry up!

84
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:14,750
This was the room, right?

85
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,510
Yes.

86
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,950
He was always yelling at us,

87
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,070
and even had me move him
from the fifth floor to the seventh

88
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:24,560
because of a room issue.

89
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,480
I had no idea what was up with him.

90
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,480
He especially wanted a corner room.

91
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,750
How long did he stay here?

92
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,040
He stayed for

93
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,680
about three or four days.

94
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,920
He didn't go out much.

95
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,240
And, it's very rare

96
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,920
to see someone visit him.

97
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,720
A woman came to see him.

98
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,360
She said she was his sister.

99
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,270
When did she come?

100
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,270
On the day he checked in,

101
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,510
and two days before he left.

102
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,480
I don't remember the exact times.

103
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,270
Do you remember

104
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,160
when he left?

105
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:54,390
He...

106
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,950
Is this security camera newly installed?

107
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,830
Why is there a camera here?

108
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,000
I don't know about this.

109
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,160
We found Liu Dazhi.

110
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,310
Liu Dazhi left the hotel

111
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,390
at around 7:21 PM that night.

112
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,360
I followed him along the way.

113
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,480
At around 7:50 PM,

114
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,680
he left Kulu.

115
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,430
When we found Liu Dazhi's car,

116
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,360
we discovered someone
had tampered with it.

117
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,390
The engine oil was leaking.

118
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,310
This was my fault.

119
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,000
As soon as I saw Liu Dazhi
leave Kulu safely,

120
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,480
I withdrew from following him.

121
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,510
If I had stayed with him,

122
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,720
maybe this wouldn't have happened.

123
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,360
Don't blame yourself.
I told you to withdraw.

124
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,510
You were standing so close
and watching it for so long.

125
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,160
I thought you would be fine.

126
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,190
I tailed him for two days,

127
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,310
worrying that he might escape.

128
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,360
When Liu Yingying hit him,

129
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,600
I still didn't believe Liu Dazhi
was in danger.

130
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,480
The dark side of human nature.

131
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,310
Everyone has it.

132
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,270
It's just a matter
of when it is activated.

133
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,320
If nothing happens,

134
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,550
no one knows
when it will be activated.

135
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,670
Bring Liu Yingying
and Wang Liang in for questioning.

136
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:28,360
Yes.

137
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,200
At the time of the incident,
both Wang Liang and Liu Yingying

138
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,390
had solid alibis.

139
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,120
Yes.

140
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,150
Liu Dazhi's call records show

141
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,480
that Liu Yingying

142
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,510
called him that day,

143
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,960
The phone call lasted 19 minutes.

144
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,720
It started at 6:15 PM,

145
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,390
and ended at 6:34 PM.

146
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,120
Afterwards,

147
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,240
Wang Liang called Liu Dazhi,

148
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,720
from 6:38 PM to 6:42 PM.

149
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,870
Five minutes later,

150
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,670
Liu Dazhi left the hotel

151
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:02,960
and drove out of Kulu.

152
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,910
There was an added camera
outside Liu Dazhi's room.

153
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,320
He was safe as long as he stayed inside.

154
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,270
What did those two

155
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,320
say to him on the phone

156
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,960
that made him leave the room?

157
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,750
Liu Dazhi was always
in a hurry to leave Kulu.

158
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,870
Luo, watch this video.

159
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,240
This is the nearest surveillance camera

160
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,720
to Wang Liang's home.

161
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,080
At 6:13 PM,

162
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,870
Wang Liang and Liu Yingying
passed by here

163
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:24,870
and went straight home.

164
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,600
Chen went to their place
at 7:05 PM

165
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,120
and left at 7:30 PM.

166
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,080
Theoretically, they didn't have time
to commit the crime.

167
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,320
These two people provided

168
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,510
a very solid alibi.

169
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,510
You are the solid alibi.

170
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,840
I'm a fool.

171
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,150
Yes, I called my brother.

172
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,550
My daughter has passed away.

173
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,030
My father's case is still unresolved.

174
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,200
I'm heartbroken.

175
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,750
In this world, my brother

176
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,910
is the only family I owned.

177
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,240
But, at that moment,

178
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,510
he was eager to go back home.

179
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,510
I was a little mad at him.

180
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,270
So I called and blamed him.

181
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,910
He comforted me a little,

182
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,480
and that was it.

183
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,320
That's all.

184
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,790
Do you get along well with your brother?

185
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,200
Yes, we do.

186
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,720
Our mother passed away very early.

187
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,000
I practically raised my brother
since he was young.

188
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,750
Even though I'm only
two years older than him,

189
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,390
sometimes I feel like

190
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,670
I am his mother.

191
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,790
From what I understand,

192
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,120
Liu Dazhi doesn't
come back to Kulu often.

193
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,120
And, you both don't
keep in touch either.

194
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,200
That's right.

195
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,320
He's busy with work
and seldom come back home.

196
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,120
We talk on the phone.

197
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,670
You mentioned that Liu Dazhi

198
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,150
is your only family now.

199
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,750
So, what's your relationship
with Wang Liang?

200
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,670
He is my other half.

201
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,200
Both of you didn't have
a marriage certificate, right?

202
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,790
And you don't recognize Wang Liang

203
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,320
as Duoduo's biological father either.

204
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,750
You were always a top student,

205
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,510
the pride of your family,

206
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,910
and a graduate
from the provincial university.

207
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,600
Someone like you

208
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:13,870
could have stayed

209
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,750
in the province
for a better future development.

210
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,910
But Wang Liang is
an illiterate furnace worker,

211
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,600
and a street child
that your father, Liu Sancheng

212
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,960
adopted from the grasslands.

213
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:28,150
You gave up a promising future
for Wang Liang.

214
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,000
Is that love

215
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,670
or hate?

216
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,630
What are you implying, Officer Luo?

217
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,480
Answer the question.

218
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,270
I was pregnant.

219
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,120
With Wang Liang's child.

220
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,910
So, do you think it is love or hate?

221
00:12:58,630 --> 00:12:59,320
That's right.

222
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,750
After Yingying called him,

223
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,270
I gave him another call

224
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,200
talking about something.

225
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,550
What did you say to him?

226
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,910
After Duoduo passed away,

227
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,790
Yingying hasn't been able to move on.

228
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,120
My father's case

229
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,120
impacted her a lot too.

230
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,080
That's why I wanted
to convince Dazhi to stay,

231
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,080
to help comfort Yingying more.

232
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,000
After my father died,

233
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,870
my brother kept thinking
that someone was trying to harm him.

234
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,320
I found it strange too.

235
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,870
I'm not sure when it started,

236
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,120
but he just always felt
someone was trying to harm him.

237
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,320
I'm from a medical background.

238
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,200
I think he might be suffering
from paranoia.

239
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,120
Maybe...

240
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,390
It was a series of incidents
that happened in his family

241
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,870
which brought him a huge stimulation.

242
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,480
I'm very worried about him.

243
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,390
I tried to convince him over
the phone for a very long time.

244
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,720
I talked to him over the phone.

245
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,360
But he insisted on going back.

246
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,200
I let him consult a doctor
when he returned.

247
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,000
That night, Chen came
to my house around 7:00 PM.

248
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,960
We talked for about half an hour.

249
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,910
Officer Chen

250
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,670
left our home

251
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,550
around 7:30 PM.

252
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,670
After he left,

253
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,080
I went back to the station.

254
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,000
- Wang Liang went to his night shift.
- I was on night duty that day.

255
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,720
I wasn't feeling well that day.

256
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,630
So I stayed at the station all night.

257
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,720
I stayed at home the whole night

258
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:16,870
and didn't attend work.

259
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,390
Liu Yingying.

260
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,390
Please check the record.

261
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,790
If there are no issues, please sign it.

262
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,600
Thank you for your cooperation.

263
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:50,200
We had already allowed
Liu Dazhi left Kulu.

264
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:53,120
So why did he stay two more days?

265
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,910
After two days, he suddenly fled

266
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,270
and ended up being murdered
in the desert.

267
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,120
Why?

268
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,270
Liu Yingying and Wang Liang
didn't have time to commit the crime.

269
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,910
There must be another person

270
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,120
involved in this case.

271
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,840
Zhang Yuan.

272
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,200
Check the call records
of Liu Yingying, Wang Liang,

273
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,790
and Liu Sancheng.

274
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,960
But, wasn't Liu Sancheng
already burned in the furnace?

275
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,320
Liu Dafu. Liu Dazhi.

276
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,320
Yes, we checked all of them.

277
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,600
Check the call records with anyone else
for the three of them.

278
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:48,750
How about we go have some lamb soup?

279

Cheng Chun was murdered by Liu Dazhi.

would hate him so much

00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:10,550
Okay, pause.

371
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,160
He was spotted near Wang Liang's place.

372
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,400
They have had private contact.

373
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,720
When did we tell Liu Dazhi
to go back to work?

374
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,200
Monday afternoon.

375
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,510
Liu Dazhi...

376
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,510
Why did he stay?

377
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,270
He stayed for two more days.

378
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:28,550
Commissioner Liu.

379
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,480
I've checked the call records.

380
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,720
On Monday at 3:21 PM,

381
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,680
Liu Dazhi called Liu Yingying.

382
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,110
Shortly after, at 5:05 PM,

383
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,350
Wang Liang called Ding Baoyuan.

384
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,720
The call lasted just over a minute.

385
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,880
So far, this is the only call
we have found between them.

386
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:48,960
Liu Dazhi decided to stay,

387
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,590
and made a call to Liu Yingying.

388
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,590
Then, Wang Liang contacted Ding Baoyuan.

389
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,160
And, Liu Dazhi

390
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,310
ended up dead.

391
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,550
Didn't I ask you to keep an eye
on Ding Baoyuan?

392
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,720
I did, Commissioner Liu.

393
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,880
I let Wei follow him.

394
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,640
He has been hanging out
with Sun Caiyun recently,

395
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,590
playing mahjong and dancing
in the public square.

396
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,110
Everything seems normal.

397
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,680
Ding Baoyuan is good
at managing his facial expressions.

398
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,920
Has anyone seen Guan Qiao
these two days?

399
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,240
Guan Qiao?

400
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:38,750
Hi.

401
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,750
We are from Kulu County Police Station.

402
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,400
Are you Guan Qiao's sister?

403
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,310
Yes.

404
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,350
We will take a look around.

405
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,480
Where is Guan Qiao?

406
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,350
He is not here.

407
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,000
He went out to look for a job.

408
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,350
When did he leave?

409
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,110
Where did he go?
What kind of job he is looking for?

410
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,790
How should I know?

411
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:57,030
You better tell the truth,

412
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:57,880
where is Guan Qiao?

413
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,880
What happened to him?

414
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,720
Just answer the question.

415
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,960
He came by here three days ago,

416
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,790
saying a man named Ding Baoyuan

417
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,160
offered him to be his lawyer,

418
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,400
and also mentioned

419
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,720
that the state compensated
Ding Baoyuan a large sum of money.

420
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,920
That's all I know.

421
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,720
Alright, we got it.

422
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,960
We will contact you if any update.

423
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:19,590
Okay.

424
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:24,920
Hello, Luo.

425
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:27,200
Guan Qiao has gone to meet Ding Baoyuan.

426
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,270
Ding Baoyuan.

427
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,640
Investigate.

428
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:08,510
Hello.

429
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,270
Sun Caiyun.

430
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,270
Luo.

431
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,160
Where are you?

432
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,160
I'm at home.

433
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,510
Is Ding Baoyuan with you?

434
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,070
He is not at home.

435
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,550
He went out.

436
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,750
How has Ding Baoyuan been

437
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,550
since he returned home?

438
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,550
He's been fine.

439
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,160
He stays with me every day,

440
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,790
dancing in the public square
and playing mahjong.

441
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:28,350
He is doing well.

442
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,310
I am just asking.

443
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,350
These two days, you two could

444
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,510
come to the police station

445
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,110
to discuss the compensation matter.

446
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,510
Alright, Luo.

447
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:35,000
Thank you.

448
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,790
It's nothing.

449
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,720
Bye.

450
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,920
Have some water.

451
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:07,720
You look tired.

452
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,310
Why do you men

453
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,960
always like hitting women?

454
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,310
Did you hear earlier?

455
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:21,110
Luo thought Ding Baoyuan
was going to kill me.

456
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,110
Yeah.

457
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,310
People like them

458
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,110
think they are so clever.

459
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,960
For them,

460
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,270
I am just a small person.

461
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,680
But they don't realize,

462
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,110
people like me

463
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,720
can do anything.

464
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:07,510
Wang Liang,

465
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,920
have an apple.

466
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:12,200
You didn't even drink the water.
Aren't you thirsty?

467
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,510
It seems I made the right choice.

468
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,790
I picked you back then

469
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:23,790
to help me send Ding Baoyuan
to prison was the right move.

470
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:30,240
Was it necessary to go that far?
That's pretty ruthless.

471
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,310
Caiyun, I'm sorry,

472
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,400
but you must die.

473
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:36,920
Once you are dead,

474
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,510
no one in this world

475
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:39,160
will know the truth.

476
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:41,240
I'm sorry, it will only take
two minutes, and you won't feel pain.

477
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,510
Wang Liang. Wang Liang.

478
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,200
You can't kill me.

479
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,510
You can't kill me.

480
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,720
You think killing me

481
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,350
will keep you and Liu Yingying safe?

482
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,830
Wang Liang,

483
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,110
you don't understand women.

484
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,590
You don't even understand your mother,

485
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,510
let alone Liu Yingying.

486
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,440
Wang Liang.

487
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,680
Your mother and mine

488
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:00,350
both came from other places.

489
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,110
Do you know why

490
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,680
their fates were different?

491
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,720
Because my mother chose to obey.

492
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,480
Your mother chose to resist.

493
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,590
What about Liu Yingying?

494
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:15,400
What do you think
about Liu Yingying's choice?

495
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:17,640
A woman's thought

496
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,070
is always hard to understand.

497
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,000
You don't understand,

498
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,960
but I do.

499
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:24,270
Let me teach you.

500
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,400
I know I am going to die.

501
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:28,310
I'll die at your hands sooner or later.

502
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:30,750
But, don't you have a lot
of questions to ask me?

503
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,510
I can help you answer them.

504
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,310
Let's take some time for it.

505
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,680
It won't be too late to kill me
after we talk about that.

506
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:45,830
Well.

507
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,070
It doesn't matter
if we wait a bit longer.

508
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,310
What do you want to talk about?

509
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,310
What I want to talk about
is not important.

510
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,480
What matters is
what you need to talk about.

511
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,310
Don't you have any questions?

512
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,070
Tell me,

513
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,880
and I'll help you figure things out.

514
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,680
Why did you

515
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,830
come from Luoche to the county?

516
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,240
Why did I come here?

517
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,680
When I was on the grasslands,

518
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,030
I had no home.

519
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,160
I felt unsafe.

520
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:39,240
But after I got to Kulu,

521
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,160
I found a home.

522
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:42,920
Do you get it?

523
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,030
You are pitiful.

524
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,240
I feel very sorry for you.

525
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,350
We are different.

526
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,880
I live for myself.

527
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,030
I just want to get out.

528
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,350
I always

529
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,270
want to get out of there,

530
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,110
aiming to a higher position.

531
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:25,640
But after I got to the county,

532
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,400
I realized that the people here

533
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,720
are so fake.

534
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,640
They flatter you superficially.

535
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,830
But deep down,

536
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:42,880
no one respects you.

537
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,240
It doesn't matter, I don't care.

538
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,350
That's why I have to keep stepping out,

539
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,350
heading to a higher position.

540
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,110
Do you know why I sent Ding Baoyuan

541
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,830
to prison?

542
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:15,240
Because he never treated me
like a human being.

543
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,590
He treated me like an animal.

544
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,240
I'm a realist.

545
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,440
I love money.

546
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,640
Money is everything to me.

547
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,830
But then I slowly realized,

548
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,830
as a human,

549
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,750
once we are satisfied materially,

550
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,880
we feel spiritually empty.

551
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:39,960
Li Rui.

552
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,440
Li Rui.

553
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,240
Yes.

554
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,680
Have you found Ding Baoyuan?

555
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,240
No, Chen.

556
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:47,160
All the major road surveillance
were checked,

557
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:47,960
but no discovery.

558
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:49,750
However, I did find something new.

559
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:52,310
Wang Liang left the county at 9:03 PM

560
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:54,680
and returned at 12:21 AM.

561
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,830
Check for Ding Baoyuan's vehicle
along the road in the province.

562
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,160
Send people for that.

563
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,350
Wang Liang,

564
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:06,480
have you ever heard the saying,

565
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,070
"literature

566
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,110
is the salvation of humanity"?

567
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,440
Guan Qiao is just great at this.

568
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:16,400
I think

569
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,960
that is also the reason

570
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,480
why you are with Liu Yingying.

571
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,960
Guan Qiao and you,
and Liu Yingying and I, are different.

572
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,440
Don't compare us to you.

573
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,240
I love Yingying.

574
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,550
She's my everything.

575
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,350
She's your everything.

576
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,590
But, what are you to her?

577
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,240
You are nothing to her,
not even a fart.

578
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:38,110
Maybe not even that.

579
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,270
Are you mad now?

580
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,510
Don't be mad, Wang Liang.

581
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,440
I know you don't like hearing this.

582
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,680
Wang Liang,

583
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,680
we are both

584
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:51,440
from Luoche.

585
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,640
You are the wild grass
of the grasslands,

586
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,750
and I am the wildflower.

587
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,480
You can grow anywhere,

588
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,680
and I can bloom anywhere.

589
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,830
We are the same kind of people.

590
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,830
Liu Yingying never cared about you.

591
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,240
All these years,

592
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:21,110
has she ever looked at you properly?

593
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,920
She looks down on you
from the bottom of her heart.

594
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,510
Neither does her father.

595
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:27,680
Their whole family looks down on you.

596
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,440
Their family

597
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,920
treat you like a thief,

598
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,160
like a free labor.

599
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,640
They've been using you.

600
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,880
Do you even know that?

601
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:37,920
So,

602
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:40,110
why should we die?

603
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:42,070
They are the ones who deserve to die.

604
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:42,830
I know

605
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,880
you killed Liu Sancheng.

606
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,830
You did well.

607
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:48,680
You should have killed
Liu Yingying too.

608
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:49,640
Killing that wife

609
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,400
who ever looked down on you.

610
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,070
Am I right?

611
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:53,350
Why are you laughing?

612
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,350
Am I wrong?

613
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:56,960
Shouldn't you kill her?

614
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:58,960
Caiyun.

615
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,240
Have you ever loved someone?

616
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,480
Yes, I have loved someone.

617
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,440
Who did you love?

618
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,230
Myself.

619
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,840
Besides me,

620
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,510
who else is worth loving?

621
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,800
How about you?

622
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,320
I have loved someone before.

623
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,760
When I was a kid, I loved my mother.

624
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,800
When I grew up, I loved my master.

625
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,800
I love Yingying.

626
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,320
Even if they don't care about me,

627
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,440
even if they never look at me properly,

628
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:32,760
I still love her.

629
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,630
Because you are a fool.

630
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,070
You are not allowed to say so.

631
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:37,230
I love her.

632
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,440
But you don't love anyone.

633
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,920
So you are the one who deserves to die.

634
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:46,920
Die?

635
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,920
I knew it. I won't die.

636
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,150
I won't die.

637
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,230
I won't die.

638
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,480
Even if you kill me,

639
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,960
I'll still come back to life.

640
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:08,510
Go die, you!

641
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,920
I'm someone strong who won't die...

642
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,110
Go die, you!

643
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,440
What are you doing here?

644
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,320
Aren't you supposed to be at work?
Leave here!

645
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:11,510
The police are now
looking for Ding Baoyuan.

646
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:12,840
They will track me down soon.

647
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,800
I've already killed Sun Caiyun.

648
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,150
There's no one left in this world
who knows what happened anymore.

649
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,030
Remember,

650
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:20,030
everything that happened was done by me

651
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:21,230
and has nothing to do with you.

652
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,440
Understand?

653
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:23,840
Leave here now!

654
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:25,480
Leave now!

655
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,000
Yingying, what are you doing?

656
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:38,360
Please leave here.

657
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,710
The police will arrest me soon.

658
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,230
It will be hard to explain
if you stay with me.

659
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,760
Let's go around

660
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,440
and see.

661
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:46,510
Don't you want to come with me?

662
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,230
There is a motorbike over there.

663
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:55,960
Hello, you can speak.

664
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:56,880
Hello, Luo.

665
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:58,550
We found the car and the people.

666
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,480
Wait a minute.

667
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:02,960
You can speak now.

668
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,800
We found the car and the people,

669
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,400
in the desert outside the province.

670
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:09,960
The body is decapitated,

671
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:12,510
and we found a bundle of steel wires.

672
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:13,280
Got it.

673
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:15,880
Let me send you off.

674
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:16,880
I'm sorry for causing you trouble.

675
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:23,880
What's wrong with her?

676
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,670
She's feeling a little unwell.

677
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,480
I'll go check on her.

678
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:27,030
Yingying.

679
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:34,760
Chen.

680
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,360
Arrest them?

681
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,590
Arrest!

682
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,800
Ma!

683
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,590
Bring people to the hospital
to arrest Liu Yingying.

684
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:45,070
Got it.

685
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:45,630
We are heading to the heating station.

686
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:46,150
Let's go, Dayong.

687
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:46,800
Alright.

688
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:55,590
[Outpatient]

689
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,840
Keep up. Hurry!

690
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,960
Is Liu Yingying in the hospital?

691
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,840
She took leave today and left early.

692
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,070
Alright, thank you.

693
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:16,480
Go take a look around.

694
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,110
Let's go.

695
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:20,920
Hello.

696
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,230
Liu Yingying is not at the hospital.

697
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,190
Where did he go?

698
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,110
Alright, you guys check again.

699
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:24,800
I don't know.

700
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,670
Did he come here yesterday?

701
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,070
No, he didn't come here
yesterday either.

702
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:30,670
Liu Yingying hasn't been to work.

703
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,920
She didn't go to work?

704
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,440
Could they be trying to escape?

705
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:36,510
It is possible.

706
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,110
Hello?

707
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,880
Hello, Luo.

708
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,880
That villain, Wang Liang.

709
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,590
He wanted to kill me.

710
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:06,710
Wang Liang wanted to kill you?

711
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:07,760
Where are you?

712
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,630
I am at home.

713
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,880
He had colluded
with Ding Baoyuan long ago.

714
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,150
They teamed up to murder Guan Qiao,

715
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,110
and then he killed Ding Baoyuan.

716
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:18,110
Now, he wanted to kill me.

717
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,400
Where is Wang Liang now?

718
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,630
He has already left.

719
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:22,360
Why are you asking so many questions?

720
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:23,480
When did he leave?

721
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:26,760
He's been leaving for a while.

722
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:28,280
Why are you only calling me now?

723
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,230
I had to make sure I was safe

724
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,760
before I called you.

725
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,150
Oh, right!

726
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,630
He drove away my car.

727
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:40,000
The car is worth over 200,000 yuan.

728
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:42,320
You have to get it back for me!

729
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,190
Hello?

730
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:45,920
Luo?

731
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,230
Luo?

732
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,760
Wang Liang tried to kill Sun Caiyun
but he failed.

733
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,030
He took away her car keys.

734
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:54,110
They are trying to escape from Kulu.

735
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:54,880
Chase them!

736
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,230
The police are catching up soon,

737
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,320
and you are still very happy?

738
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:46,230
Of course.

739
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,110
Why wouldn't I be happy?

740
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,230
Everything that needed
to be done is done.

741
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:54,440
What could be

742
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,280
more satisfying than that?

743

outside of Kulu, it's enough.

Haven't you ever thought

754
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:43,230
about going out and exploring the world?

755
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:47,840
Why do you all want to leave here?

Mr. Chen.

758
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:52,960
Last time, he took me

759
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,480
to get a DNA test,

760
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,710
saying that he wanted to help me
find my relatives outside.

What a big piece of this!

777
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,320
It is salty and sour.

778
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,030
It is the taste of my childhood.

I am used to it.

00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,280
It is completely different
from what I imagined.

reached the outside.

Yingying, do you still remember the
field of flowers that Duoduo was buried?

791
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:53,440
The other kids had toys,

792
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:54,710
but Duoduo didn't.

793
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:57,110
But, I didn't think

794
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,760
she was any worse off
than the other kids.

795
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,960
She loved playing hide-and-seek with me

796

Back then, Wang Liang's mother

was ready to escape from Luoche.

818
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:46,920
She wanted to take Wang Liang with her.

Wang Liang was seven years old.

820
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:51,150
He told his father about it.

821

What is that?

He thought the family couldn't
be complete without their mother.

But his mother was not happy.

I hope it is you.

929
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:21,880
Yingying,

930
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,070
just listen to me this once.

931
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:33,480
Wang Liang.

932
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,070
Wang Liang.

933
00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:44,550
There's quicksand up ahead.

934
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:45,960
Don't let them follow us in.

935
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:46,630
Got it.

936
00:54:52,510 --> 00:54:53,320
Wang Liang!

937
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:57,550
Wang Liang!

938
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:06,320
Liu Yingying.

939
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:08,110
You are suspected
of intentional homicide.

940
00:55:08,110 --> 00:55:09,510
We are arresting you
according to the law.

941
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:19,590
Yingying,

942
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:20,480
come here.

943
00:55:21,230 --> 00:55:22,150
He is Wang Liang.

944
00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:23,840
From now on, he will live with us.

945
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:25,550
We are family now.

946
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:28,230
You need to get along like a sibling.

947
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,070
Why are you staring at me?

948
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:36,760
Close your eyes,

949
00:55:37,070 --> 00:55:38,440
or you will get hair in your eyes.

950
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:05,280
Yingying,

951
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:07,150
you should marry to Wang Liang.

952
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:09,840
Yingying,

953
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,630
I will treat you well
for the rest of my life.

954
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:14,840
Let's live a good life together.

955
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:16,110
Yingying.

956
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:16,800
Don't touch me.

957
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:30,880
This child is so adorable.

958
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:32,840
Have you thought of a name yet?

959
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:33,880
Not yet.

960
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:36,320
Duoduo.

961
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:38,440
Liu Duoduo.

962
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:42,280
Aren't you the father of the child?

963
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:43,760
He is the child's uncle.

964
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,030
Yingying,

965
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:50,280
if only one of us can survive,

966
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:52,440
I hope it is you.
