1
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,080
Come on, Baoyuan.

2
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:13,080
Be careful.

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,590
All right, just see us off here.

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:16,920
Thanks, guys.

5
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,000
All right, just see us off here.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,030
You all shall go back now.

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,030
Come on in.

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,230
Thank you.

9
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:23,920
Take care of Baoyuan.

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,510
Thank you.

11
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,120
Sure, I will.

12
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:26,480
Zhuangzhuang.

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,390
Zhuangzhuang.

14
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:30,870
- It's Dad.
- Zhuangzhuang.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,670
Come on, call your dad.

16
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,150
Dad.

17
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:37,640
Let me hug you, come on.

18
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:38,750
Let me hug you.

19
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,030
This kid...

20
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,150
He'll get used to it.

21
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,520
You haven't hugged him for eight years.

22
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,240
Come on, sit down.

23
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:52,710
I'll get your slippers.

24
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,390
This cabinet is new.

25
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,390
So you can come back
with a new piece of furniture

26
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:03,880
to get rid of the bad luck.

27
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,790
Change into slippers.

28
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,230
They'll make you feel more comfortable.

29
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:13,840
No need.

30
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,280
Is it okay?

31
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,120
The couch is pretty comfy, isn't it?

32
00:01:58,790 --> 00:01:59,640
Baoyuan,

33
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,230
here, have some water.

34
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,070
You've started reading?

35
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,240
Yes.

36
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,280
To pass the time while you're away.

37
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,630
And to occupy myself.

38
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,400
Zhuangzhuang's got a lot of awards.

39
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,630
He's an outstanding student.

40
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,120
He usually stays in this room.

41
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,520
Zhuangzhuang, stop playing.

42
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,520
Do your homework.

43
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,240
Listen to your mom

44
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,630
and study hard.

45
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,080
This is our room.

46
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,400
Let me help you.

47
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,030
Give it to me.

48
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,360
You're still as beautiful as ever.

49
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,800
Your hair's gone gray.

50
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,960
Did you think

51
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,080
I'd never get out?

52
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,280
What do you mean, Baoyuan?

53
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,190
Baoyuan!

54
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,000
You've got a kept man,

55
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,030
you tricked me into going to prison,

56
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,710
and you've taken over my property.

57
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,630
I'll kill you.

58
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:09,910
Mom.

59
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:14,910
Have you finished your homework?

60
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,430
Your mom is tired.

61
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,680
Let her sleep for a while.

62
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,750
Go and play, Zhuangzhuang.

63
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:59,090
[Sandstorm]
[Episode 10]

64
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,240
Stop pretending.

65
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,040
You can't hold it in for much longer.

66
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,360
You're still as much of a tease

67
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,310
as you were eight years ago.

68
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,310
I'm not as gullible
as I was eight years ago.

69
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,360
You're so bad.

70
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,070
Did you really want to kill me?

71
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,560
It's been eight years.

72
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,310
I couldn't bear to let you die

73
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,310
at once.

74
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,240
Sorry, Baoyuan.

75
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,830
Sorry, I was wrong.

76
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,310
Baoyuan,

77
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,310
I was forced to.

78
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,430
I met Guan Qiao's sister

79
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,480
when I was doing square dancing.

80
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,510
She told me

81
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,630
he was a writer
and wanted to interview me,

82
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,270
so she tricked me
into going to his house

83
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,830
and he

84
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,040
raped me.

85
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,240
He made me lie

86
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,000
to put you in prison.

87
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
He said if I didn't cooperate with him,

88
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,950
he'd tell everyone that I cuckolded you

89
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,560
and that you'd beat me to death,

90
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,190
that I'd be worse than dead.

91
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,870
I was pregnant at the time.

92
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,190
I was so scared.

93
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,510
I was scared.

94
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,270
Guan Qiao told me

95
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,360
about you and Cheng Chun, too.

96
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,070
I was so angry.

97
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,600
I said yes to him

98
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,750
in a fit of pique.

99
00:07:58,870 --> 00:07:59,680
I'm sorry.

100
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,870
I'm sorry.

101
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,120
Anyway,

102
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,680
how did Cheng Chun die?

103
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,240
You didn't kill her,

104
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,360
and I didn't kill her, right?

105
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,720
That night at the heating station,

106
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,510
there were only you,

107
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,870
Liu Sancheng and Wang Liang.

108
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,240
Liu Sancheng is dead now.

109
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,390
But why would Wang Liang

110
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,720
lie to you?

111
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,870
Do you know
what Cheng Chun's relationship

112
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:30,680
with them is?

113
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,120
Now

114
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,550
that you're released,

115
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,600
let's get to the bottom of this.

116
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,600
If you kill me,

117
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,320
no one can help you.

118
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,600
We'll never know

119
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,480
who the real murderer is.

120
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,080
They're all our enemies.

121
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,750
I hate them.

122
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,600
Besides,

123
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,550
we still have Zhuangzhuang,

124
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,320
right?

125
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,550
Zhuangzhuang hasn't had a father
for eight years.

126
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,480
If he loses hiss mum again,

127
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,200
he'll be pitiful.

128
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,670
We're both still young.

129
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,440
The good times have just begun.

130
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,550
I am thinking

131
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,240
of giving you another child.

132
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,750
We

133
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:21,150
are like two pieces of ginger
that can't be separated.

134
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,030
You can't leave me,

135
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,390
and I can't leave you.

136
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,120
Baoyuan,

137
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,120
in the future,

138
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,600
you're going to need me

139
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,550
for a lot of things.

140
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:51,600
You've got money for the bath,

141
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,480
but not for me, right?

142
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,320
Lei.

143
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,120
Lei.

144
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:56,360
I heard

145
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,840
you got dumped by Sun Caiyun.

146
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,030
No.

147
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,600
No. Don't search me, Lei.

148
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,320
Give me two days.

149
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,440
Give me two days and I'll pay you.

150
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,630
Two days?

151
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,600
Think of something now.

152
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,080
When are you going to pay me?

153
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,600
In these few days.

154
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,630
Lei.

155
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,150
Caiyun.

156
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,910
What's going on?

157
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:15,550
Caiyun.

158
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,320
No big deal. He owes me some money.

159
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,120
She didn't dump you?

160
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,790
We have a good relationship.

161
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,150
How much does he owe?

162
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,910
It's not much. 2,200 yuan.

163
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,150
Isn't it 2,000 yuan?

164
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,240
What about interest?

165
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,150
Don't be so insensible.

166
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,550
If Lei says 2,200 yuan, so be it.

167
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,270
Don't bargain. Do you think
you're buying groceries?

168
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,390
Let me see.

169
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,600
I'll pay you back 1,000 yuan first.

170
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,390
- I'll send you the rest later.
- Okay.

171
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,510
I can trust you.

172
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,510
What are you doing?

173
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,790
Lei's just shaking my hand.

174
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,200
Thank you.

175
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,390
All right,
let's drink together some day.

176
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,120
Sure.

177
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,510
Goodbye, Lei.

178
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,960
What kind of project

179
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,080
that costs so much money?

180
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,440
I lost in mahjong.

181
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,270
It's not about the bath.

182
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,120
Is that so?

183
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,870
We haven't seen each other
for a long time.

184
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,910
What have you been up to?

185
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:10,720
Stop it.

186
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,550
There are a lot of people coming
and going here.

187
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,720
Ding Baoyuan is back.
He doesn't suspect us, does he?

188
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,600
No, why would he?

189
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,550
He's been in prison for eight years

190
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,670
and he's confused now.

191
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,910
Qiao, let's go.

192
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:27,870
Come home with me.

193
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,390
Why would I go to your house?

194
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,360
Let him settle the score with me?

195
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,960
What score?

196
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,360
You told me last time

197
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,390
he could apply
for more than 2 million yuan

198
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,150
in state compensation.

199
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,120
You're really smart.
He can really get that much money.

200
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,960
What did I say?

201
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,440
That's more than 2 million yuan.

202
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,510
What does he need all that money for?

203
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,390
That's right.

204
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,550
So

205
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,150
we need to find a way

206
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,720
to get our hands on the money.

207
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,960
I told him

208
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,600
you're a lawyer

209
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,750
and you can help him apply
for state compensation.

210
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,480
He believed it.

211
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,120
I don't know anything about the law.

212
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,200
I can't do it.

213
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,000
I... I'm not going.

214
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,670
Don't be a wimp.

215
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,060
Be confident, will you?

216
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,870
You've read so many books for nothing.

217
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,870
Even if you don't think about yourself,

218
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,550
you have to think
about me and Zhuangzhuang.

219
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,550
Once we've got the money,

220
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,550
Zhuangzhuang and I will leave

221
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,150
this hellhole with you.

222
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,080
You're not really going
to give Zhuangzhuang and me

223
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,390
to Ding Baoyuan, are you?

224
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,240
Will it work?

225
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,200
Why not?

226
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,550
You're so talented

227
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,240
and you love to learn.

228
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,360
Get yourself

229
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,960
some law books

230
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,440
and read and memorize them.

231
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,440
It will definitely work.

232
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,440
I believe you.

233
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,270
I'll wait for you.

234
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,150
Caiyun.

235
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,670
Caiyun.

236
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,840
I'll wait for you.

237
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,150
Study hard.

238
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,550
Is he home?

239
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,270
Yes.

240
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,080
Do I really have to do this?

241
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,150
Yes, come in.

242
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,240
He's been locked up for eight years
and he's gone dumb.

243
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,630
Will it work?

244
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,270
Be confident.

245
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,360
Baoyuan,

246
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,510
The lawyer, Mr. Guan, is here.

247
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,360
Hello.

248
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,270
Let me introduce you to each other.

249
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,750
This is Guan Qiao.

250
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,600
He used to be a famous writer,

251
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,670
now he's a lawyer.

252
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,080
He's both a writer and a lawyer.

253
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,270
Mr. Guan,

254
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,720
we're counting on you
for Baoyuan's application

255
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,750
for state compensation.

256
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,480
No problem.

257
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:46,750
Let's sit down and talk about it.

258
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,270
Have a seat.

259
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,840
Be careful.

260
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,150
Mr. Guan,

261
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,000
I'm counting on you

262
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,870
for this trifle.

263
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,870
No problem.

264
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,200
Here,

265
00:13:59,200 --> 00:13:59,960
have some water.

266
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,120
Sit properly.

267
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,270
Mr. Guan,

268
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,790
my husband said

269
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,200
to entrust this matter to you.

270
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,320
When it's done, you'll get your share.

271
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,480
How much should we give him?

272
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,150
It's up to you.

273
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,150
It's up to me?

274
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,150
Well...

275
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,150
What are the rules

276
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,480
in your industry?

277
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:26,440
What's the usual rate for the industry?

278
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,440
We go by the compensation offer,

279
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,720
usually 20%, something like that.

280
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,750
Okay.

281
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,510
Money doesn't matter to me.

282
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,200
I spent eight years in prison

283
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,080
and learned this one thing.

284
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,720
Yes.

285
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,390
So, Mr. Guan,

286
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,080
Please go

287
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,630
with Ding.

288
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,670
Where to?

289
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,150
To the province.

290
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:53,150
I have an appointment
with the judge, Mr. Xu,

291
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,270
of the provincial court.

292
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,440
He's waiting for my lawyer

293
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,960
to talk about state compensation.

294
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,080
Can you come with me?

295
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,870
Sure, of course.

296
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,080
When are we leaving?

297
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,600
The appointment is tomorrow morning.

298
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,910
We have to go there today.

299
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,120
Today?

300
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:06,670
Well,

301
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,720
can we make it?

302
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:08,910
Yes, you can.

303
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,000
Don't worry.

304
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,960
It gets dark late here,

305
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,200
so it's only a seven-hour drive
to the province.

306
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,660
You'll be driving our car.

307
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,440
The two of you will be there in no time,

308
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,550
talking and laughing.

309
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,790
You're not coming?

310
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,120
Why should I?

311
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,240
Zhuangzhuang is still at home.

312
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,510
I have to look after him.

313
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:26,750
Right, Ding.

314
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,910
When you get to the province,
be generous,

315
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,600
find a nice restaurant,

316
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,320
treat him to a meal,

317
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,200
and then find a nice hotel

318
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,360
to rest for the night.

319
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:35,750
Okay.

320
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,030
Just recharge your batteries.

321
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,630
So you'll be fresh and ready
to go to the judge in the morning.

322
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:40,840
Okay.

323
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,200
Let's go now.

324
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:42,750
Go.

325
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,550
Take the key.

326
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,000
Drive safe.

327
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:50,840
Don't worry.

328
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,240
I will

329
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,270
take care of Mr. Ding
when we go to the province.

330
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:54,960
Okay.

331
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,870
Thank you.

332
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,440
Dad.

333
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:09,960
Ding,

334
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:11,670
he called you.

335
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:21,960
Zhuangzhuang,

336
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,550
I'm going out for the day.

337
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,600
I'll be back tomorrow.

338
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,200
Yes,

339
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,480
Zhuangzhuang.

340
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,270
Dad's in a hurry to go out.

341
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,480
Say goodbye to Dad.

342
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,720
Bye, Dad.

343
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:34,750
Mr. Ding,

344
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,320
let's go now.

345
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,240
Zhuangzhuang,

346
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,840
Pack your things

347
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,790
and take your books with you.

348
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,390
We'll go to Grandma's house. Let's go.

349
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:37,920
Ding,

350
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,510
have some water.

351
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,790
Caiyun told me everything.

352
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,070
Over the years,

353
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:49,880
you've been taking care of her

354
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,550
and the kid.

355
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,400
What... What did she say?

356
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,030
About my appeal.

357
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,720
It's a lot of trouble for you.

358
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,720
It's not easy for Madam Sun
to be on her own.

359
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,830
I just help out as much as I can,

360
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:10,790
but not much.

361
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,510
Mr. Guan, you're still a writer.

362
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,070
I'm an amateur writer.

363
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,310
I write occasionally.

364
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,480
You're being humble.

365
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,160
You've published several books,

366
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,510
how can you still be an amateur?

367
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,720
And I heard your book signing

368
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,240
was a blast.

369
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,510
What's the name of that book?

370
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,400
"Haunted Love".

371
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,200
It's about love

372
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,640
and human nature.

373
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,550
It's good to write about human nature.

374
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,240
Human nature.

375
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,480
What else?

376
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:48,960
"Tears of Sorrow".

377
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,480
It's also about love.

378
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,960
It's a little more

379

566
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,480
I... I have to go on duty.

567
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:55,030
Night shift?

568
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,310
It's hard work.

569
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,030
Yes.

570
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,000
Well...

571
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,440
Liu Yingying is here, too.

572
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:04,880
Yes.

573
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,830
Why didn't you tell me just now?

574
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,400
I'm embarrassed to be here.

575
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,070
It's okay.

576
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,230
- I'm home on leave today.
- I'm sorry.

577
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,110
Yingying is ready to rest

578
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,840
I'm going to need a few minutes
of your time.

579
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:14,800
Okay.

580
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,000
Get Mr. Chen a cup of tea.

581
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:21,800
Okay.

582
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:22,710
I'm good.

583
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,710
I've just had Mutton Vermicelli Soup.

584
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:26,150
No need.

585
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,280
That's why you need a cup of tea now

586
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,230
to relieve the grease.

587
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,070
Thank you.

588
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:30,880
Have some peanuts.

589
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,840
I'll turn the light on.

590
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,070
Okay, it's bright now.

591
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,150
Here you go, Mr. Chen.

592
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:38,280
We're trying to save electricity.

593
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,360
It's not a premium tea,

594
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,190
I hope you don't mind.

595
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,150
It's good.

596
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,960
It's like I'm the owner.

597
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:57,190
Sit down.

598
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,800
Give me your bag.

599
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,630
It's dirty.

600
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,590
What brings you here, Mr. Chen?

601
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,630
I don't know what to begin with.

602
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:35,670
It's a nice tea.

603
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,550
I should have come here already.

604
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,920
I should have been here earlier.

605
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,510
If the case isn't solved,

606
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:54,400
we can't return
he victim's body to you.

607
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,000
Please be understanding.

608
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,590
We understand.

609
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,440
Thanks for supporting our work.

610
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,800
Mr. Chen, so when can we get it?

611
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,510
Soon.

612
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,920
It has to be soon.

613
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,320
I can understand your feelings.

614
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:03,110
Right,

615
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:04,360
the DNA test I asked you

616
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,070
to do last time

617
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:06,360
has been filed.

618
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:08,360
I'm sure it won't take long

619
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,710
to find your family.

620
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:12,840
Mr. Chen,

621
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,280
let's put everything else aside.

622
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,800
My dad's more important right now.

623
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:33,590
That's Duoduo, right?

624
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,110
Yes.

625
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:41,920
How old was she?

626
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,510
It was taken last year.

627
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:49,320
Six years old.

628
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:52,150
It doesn't look like it was taken
in a photo studio.

629
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,800
In the hospital.

630
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,960
The hospital yard.

631
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,510
It's a pity that Duoduo

632
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,230
was only six.

633
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,320
Mr. Chen,

634
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,480
let's not talk about Duoduo.

635
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:34,400
We ran

636
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,320
a match

637
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,840
on your DNA, by the way.

638
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,630
The results

639
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:40,590
confirmed that you and Duoduo
are father and daughter.

640
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,550
Well...

641
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:49,030
- I...
- Mr. Chen,

642
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:53,400
Everyone knows that my father

643
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,800
took Wang Liang as his godson.

644
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:55,920
including you.

645
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,280
Then we got together,

646
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,480
and my dad thought
it would be a shame to tell everyone,

647
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,840
so we kept it a secret.

648
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,710
Since you know about it,

649
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,110
please keep it a secret for us.

650
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:08,960
Yes, Mr. Chen.

651
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,280
Why would you hide it?

652
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:13,880
If you two have a good relationship,

653
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,510
why would you hide it?

654
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,070
Shouldn't you go to the Civil
Affairs Bureau to get a certificate

655
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,550
and get on with your lives?

656
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,480
Who's in the way
of you living a good life?

657
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,320
Who can interfere?

658
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:32,510
Yes, you're right, Mr. Chen.

659
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,800
You are

660
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,070
more old-fashioned than I am.

661
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,670
I don't even think that way.

662
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:04,550
Hello.

663
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:05,230
Chen.

664
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:07,440
Liu Dazhi has left Kulu safely.

665
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:08,030
Who?

666
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:08,920
Liu Dazhi?

667
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,630
What's wrong with Liu Dazhi?

668
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,840
He has left Kulu.

669
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:12,070
He has left Kulu?

670
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,110
You can come back now.

671
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,000
Dazhi left Kulu

672
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,030
without telling me.

673
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,030
Fu.

674
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,510
You'd better get to work now.

675
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,070
Yes. Mr. Chen, I...

676
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:30,710
I'll talk to Mr. Chen.

677
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:31,550
I'm going back on duty.

678
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:34,550
I'm done here, too.

679
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,440
I'll give you a lift.

680
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:38,360
No need.

681
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,440
It's the middle of the night.
I don't want to trouble you.

682
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:44,400
It's no trouble at all.

683
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,510
No need, Mr. Chen.

684
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,550
I'm embarrassed.

685
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:54,760
What's wrong?

686
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,760
She's not feeling well.

687
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,510
I'll go and take a look.

688
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,110
Yingying.

689
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:01,710
Mr. Chen.

690
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,920
The day of Duoduo's funeral,

691
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,280
I had to work and couldn't make it.

692
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,880
I came to see Duoduo.

693
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,630
Duoduo,

694
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:36,710
The flowers are blooming.

695
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:38,480
[Beloved Daughter, Duoduo]
They're beautiful.

696
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:41,760
Where is Master?

697
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,400
He left after saying something
about a banquet.

698
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,110
Banquet?

699
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,800
[Beloved Daughter, Duoduo]

700
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,710
When your master went out that day,

701
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:02,630
he said the word "banquet".

702
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:04,320
[23 May 2005]
You remember that, don't you?

703
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,510
There couldn't be a banquet.

704
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:07,760
The 23rd of June
wasn't an auspicious day

705
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,670
or a festival

706
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:10,920
or anything.

707
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:11,880
I'm sure

708
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,960
he was out on duty that day.

709
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,190
Where are you?

710
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:33,190
Liu.

711
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,550
I've figured it out.

712
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,510
The banquet
that Master said back then...

713
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:38,320
All right, stop it.

714
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:41,710
Come to the hospital.
Master can't hold on much longer.

715
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,400
- Chen.
- Chen.

716
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,280
Chen.

717
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:01,670
Mrs. Ge,

718
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,400
how's Master?

719
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,230
The doctor said it was organ failure.

720
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,480
He was like that
when he was brought here.

721
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:12,360
I've figured it out.

722
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:14,510
The banquet Master mentioned

723
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,760
wasn't a wedding banquet.

724
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:19,110
It's a full moon celebration for a baby.

725
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:21,040
23rd June 2005

726
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:23,320
was Wang Liang and Liu Yingying's
baby's first month of birth.

727
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,710
The family rushed to Luoche

728
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:27,630
to hold a full moon celebration.

729
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,320
Master knew

730
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,360
and drove

731
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:33,440
to Luoche.

732
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,510
That was the day Master found out

733
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:39,840
the Liu family was involved in the case.

734
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:47,960
If I hadn't stopped Master...

735
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,190
Jianghe.

736
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:56,920
I...

737
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:00,800
If I hadn't stopped Master,

738
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:07,000
the real murderer
would have been caught.

739
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:11,590
Jianghe.

740
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:12,440
Master.

741
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:16,920
I was wrong, Master.

742
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:21,960
I was wrong, Master.

743
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:40,000
Jianghe.

744
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,030
I'm sorry.

745
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:57,960
Master.

746
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:02,630
Mrs. Ge.

747
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:05,960
Master.

748
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:06,550
Ge.

749
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:07,880
Master.

750
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:08,400
Ge.

751
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:08,880
Master.

752
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:09,960
Ge.

753
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:10,800
Master.

754
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:11,590
Ge.

755
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,000
The patient, Ge Dajie

756
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,440
died at

757
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,230
15:27:46

758
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:25,000
on 3 April 2012.

759
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:02,510
The superiors approved my application

760
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,480
but Master wouldn't sign.

761
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,880
My family was pressing me hard

762
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:09,110
and I was in a hurry
to get transferred to the province.

763
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,110
During that time,
I wasn't focused on my work at all.

764
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:20,030
Where is Master?

765
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,630
He just got out.

766
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:22,630
Where to?

767
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,920
He left after saying something
about a banquet.

768
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:25,630
Banquet?

769
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:28,000
He's going to a wedding banquet.

770
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:29,800
Banquet, my foot.

771
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:44,320
Master,

772
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,920
where is the banquet you are going to?

773
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:46,920
Hello, Chen,

774
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:49,150
Master left his mobile phone
on his desk.

775
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:15,030
Master, where are you going?

776
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:16,230
You're in a hurry.

777
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,070
Master!

778
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:45,230
Master!

779
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:50,760
Master!

780
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:52,110
Stop the car!

781
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,320
Master!

782
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:09,760
Stop the car!

783
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,760
Stop the car!

784
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,150
Master!

785
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:27,920
What's the matter?

786
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:28,630
Master,

787
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,800
please sign this transfer request.

788
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:32,150
I have an emergency at the moment.

789
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:34,510
So do I. My wife and kids are waiting.

790
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:35,960
I don't have time to talk to you.

791
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,400
Wait. Master, please sign it.

792
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:38,630
Master!

793
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:42,590
You must sign it today.

794
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:11,230
What a stubborn man.

795
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:12,630
Why won't you sign this for me?

796
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:15,550
My wife and kids don't want me anymore.

797
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,110
It's urgent, too.

798
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:20,760
Stubborn and cowardly.

799
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,590
You must sign it today.

800
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,510
Come back!

801
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:37,960
There's a quicksand pit!

802
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:40,590
Stubborn man.

803
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:41,550
Stubborn and cowardly.}

804
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,670
Stop your car, Master!

805
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:45,630
Silly boy,

806
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,440
get back on the road!

807
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,670
You must sign it today.

808
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:22,590
Master

809
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,760
Master

810
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:02,510
Master

811
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:20,630
Liu!

812
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:22,000
Master is

813
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:24,400
buried in quicksand!

814
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,190
Inform his family!

815
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,630
You can see my car about 12 kilometers

816
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,360
west of town.

817
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,400
Help!

818
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:44,070
Master!

819
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:13,630
Liu, quick!

820
00:54:14,110 --> 00:54:16,000
Get here immediately!

821
00:55:06,030 --> 00:55:06,550
Mrs. Ge, this way.

822
00:55:06,550 --> 00:55:07,070
Where is he?

823
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:07,710
This way.

824
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,030
Where is Ge?

825
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:09,760
Here.

826
00:55:10,070 --> 00:55:10,670
Ge.

827
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:11,320
How's he doing?

828
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,000
Ge.

829
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:12,960
- Mrs. Ge.
- Madam Wang.

830
00:55:13,630 --> 00:55:14,400
What happened to him?

831
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:17,960
What happened to him?

832
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:20,590
Master and I

833
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:21,960
encountered quicksand.

834
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:25,320
Ge.

835
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:26,550
Ge.

836
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:28,150
Doctor.

837
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:29,230
Who's the patient's family?

838
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:30,030
Me.

839
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:30,760
Hi.

840
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:31,840
The patient's brain function
has been impaired

841
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:32,960
by the lack of oxygen for a long time

842
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,230
and he'll probably not wake up.

843
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:35,670
Please go through the admission
procedure as soon as possible.

844
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:36,880
He will not wake up?

845
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,190
No, no way.

846
00:55:38,190 --> 00:55:38,760
I'm sorry.

847
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:39,710
Let me see him.

848
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:40,630
Ge...

849
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:41,440
Please wait outside.

850
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,280
What's going on?

851
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:42,920
Mrs. Ge.

852
00:55:43,190 --> 00:55:43,920
Ge.

853
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:44,800
That won't happen.

854
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,000
Why would Ge...

855
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:49,030
Mrs. Ge.

856
00:55:49,030 --> 00:55:49,800
Why would he...

857
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,030
Madam Wang, calm down.

858
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:52,400
- It's all right.
- Ge.

859
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,480
Captain Ge will be fine. Calm down.

860
00:55:54,590 --> 00:55:55,480
- Ge.
- Mrs. Ge.

861
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:56,320
Calm down, Mrs. Ge.

862
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:56,920
- Mrs. Ge.
- Mrs. Ge.

863
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:57,710
It's all right, Mrs. Ge.

864
00:55:57,710 --> 00:55:58,840
Calm down.

865
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:00,280
Ge.

866
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:03,400
What's going on, Ge?

867
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,280
For seven years,

868
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:07,710
I've been afraid to face

869
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:10,110
my superiors and colleagues at Kulu.

870
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:13,110
I volunteered

871
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:16,590
to go to Luoche

872
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:19,590
because I didn't dare to face myself.

873
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:43,670
Let bygones

874
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:47,920
be bygones.

875
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:52,320
Jianghe,

876
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:56,150
if Ge had seen how you have been doing
for the last seven years,

877
00:56:58,630 --> 00:57:01,670
he wouldn't have been happy about it.

878
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:10,510
Think about
what your master did back then.

879
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:13,150
Do a good job

880
00:57:14,590 --> 00:57:16,920
and that's the best thing
you can do for him.

881
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:41,670
As we said,

882
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,230
let's solve this case before you leave.

883
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:43,840
Look at that.

884
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:45,110
Come back!

885
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:46,480
There's a quicksand pit!

886
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:56,710
Think about what your master

887
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,070
did back then.

888
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:53,190
Chen,

889
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:54,710
you're not answering your phone

890
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:55,710
and you're not in the office.

891
00:58:55,710 --> 00:58:56,880
What are you sieving here?

892
00:58:57,030 --> 00:58:58,110
This is the slag

893
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:01,840
from the furnace on the night
of Cheng Chun's case.

894
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,590
My master brought it back.

895
00:59:07,230 --> 00:59:08,480
Master had been sieving

896
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:09,550
until he got into an accident.

897
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,030
What did your master find out?

898
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:13,360
I don't know.

899
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:15,630
What have you found out?

900
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,630
There must be a reason
for Master's sieving.

901
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:20,840
I'm not sure

902
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:22,880
what it is.

903
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:25,510
Are you going
to investigate this case or not?

904
00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:27,150
We have a lot of work to do.

905
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:29,480
I'll cooperate with you.

906
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:31,230
You've got a new lead?

907
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:33,400
No.

908
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:40,320
You let Liu Dazhi go,

909
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:41,400
and you're not investigating the case.

910
00:59:46,030 --> 00:59:46,960
What a fool.

911
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:49,000
Fool?

912
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:51,030
