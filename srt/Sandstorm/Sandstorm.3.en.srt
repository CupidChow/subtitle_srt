1
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,910
You carry a dead rat in your waist
and you pretend to be a hunter?

2
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,320
You're such a wimp.

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,830
How dare you say you're in prison
for murder?

4
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:16,230
Big Brother, I didn't kill anyone.

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,120
I didn't kill anyone, Big Brother.

6
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:19,920
See? You've confessed.

7
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:20,830
Big Brother.

8
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:22,920
How do you know he's a fake?

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,230
My wife and his wife

10
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:25,320
always play mahjong together.

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,920
Nowadays, everyone knows

12
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,280
that his wife is keeping a toy boy.

13
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,320
If he's so capable,

14
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,350
does his wife have the guts
to keep a toy boy

15
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:36,880
I thought someone tough came.

16
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,670
After all,

17
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:39,430
it's a

18
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,840
cuckold, inside and out.

19
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,350
Cuckold, keep your head down
if you see me

20
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,710
in the cell from now on.

21
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,470
Don't talk to me with your head up.

22
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:58,520
Do you remember?

23
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,520
Yes.

24
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,920
Big Brother, just now...

25
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,710
Keep your head down.

26
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:07,640
Big Brother,

27
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,710
is it true what you just said

28
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:10,760
about my wife?

29
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,510
Cuckold, I can't

30
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,710
talk to you about this.

31
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,590
I'm not the toy boy,

32
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:24,590
right?

33
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:25,510
Yes.

34
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,590
You should learn from Ding Baoyuan

35
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:47,790
and work hard
to get your sentences reduced.

36
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:48,950
Did you hear me?

37
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:49,640
Yes.

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,790
Report!

39
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,350
Is there anything else you want to ask?

40
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,920
I'd like to request a book.

41
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:04,440

42
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:33,930
[Sandstorm]

43
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:04,400
[Sandstorm]
[Episode 3]

44
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,560
Name.

45
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:42,800
Ding Baoyuan.

46
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,040
Age.

47
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,040
52.

48
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,000
Current address.

49
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:52,480
Cell 205, Nache Prison.

50
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,000
Ding Baoyuan,

51
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,240
you've been appealing
against the charges against you.

52
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,430
In the interest of the case and you,

53
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,270
we're going to review the case again.

54
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,950
We're going to question you now.

55
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,560
Ding Baoyuan,

56
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,630
You said you didn't commit the murder,

57
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,720
so tell us everything you did

58
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,720
on that day again.

59
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,920
Don't hide or distort anything.

60
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,360
Yes.

61
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,480
That afternoon,

62
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,160
I had a meeting at the factory.

63
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,480
Since the meeting ended early,

64
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:30,240
I thought I'd stop by home for dinner.

65
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:34,390
But when I got home, no one was home,

66
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,950
so I didn't have dinner.

67
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,870
On my way back to the station,

68
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,600
I had dinner and a drink

69
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,430
at a small restaurant.

70
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,920
When I got to the station,

71
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,360
I played card games
with the workers on duty.

72
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,560
At around 9 PM,

73
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,120
my wife called me

74
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,000
and said she knew I was home.

75
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,800
She was out shopping

76
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,720
and ran into the lecher, Ma Jincai.

77
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,430
Ma Jincai harassed her,

78
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,360
hugging her with his arms around her.

79
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,720
When I heard that, I got angry

80
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,800
and went to see Ma Jincai
under the influence of booze.

81
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,870
But I looked for him for over an hour

82
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,680
and I couldn't find him.

83
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,720
It should be about 11 PM
by the time I get back to the station.

84
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,240
When I got to the station,

85
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,800
I locked the gate.

86
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,600
Are you sure you locked it?

87
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:22,920
Yes.

88
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,240
Because locking the gate
is the most important task

89
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,800
in the night shift
of the station manager.

90
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,510
I locked the gate

91
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,070
and then I went round the yard

92
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,480
to the furnace room
to talk to Liu San...

93
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,950
I talked Liu Sancheng
and Wang Liang for a while.

94
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:42,720
How many minutes did you talk?

95
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,510
Five to six minutes

96
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,240
or seven to eight minutes.

97
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,480
Not for long, anyway.

98
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,040
We just had a casual talk.

99
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,870
Nothing happened,

100
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,680
then I went back
to the duty room and slept

101
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,040
until dawn.

102
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,430
I got back to the station
at 10 PM that night,

103
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,750
and as soon as I entered the door,
I noticed a figure

104
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,310
sneaking by the coal pile.

105
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,830
I thought she was stealing coal

106
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,000
and wanted to teach her a lesson.

107
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,160
So I went behind her

108
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,560
and grabbed the shovel next to her

109
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,830
and smacked her hard on the head.

110
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,390
I checked to see if she was breathing,
but she didn't seem to be.

111
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,750
I carried her on my back
into the furnace room

112
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,390
and stuffed her in the slag box.

113
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,680
Until dawn,

114
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,190
Wang Liang called me

115
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,430
to say that a body had been discovered.

116
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,070
Sir and Madam,

117
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,240
I didn't see anyone

118
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,270
in the yard at all.

119
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,240
I didn't hit anyone with a shovel

120
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,920
and stuff her in the furnace.

121
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,360
I'm wrongly accused.

122
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,600
You said you went round the yard.

123
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:50,040
Is it possible that there's
someone hiding that you didn't see?

124
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,390
We had to pay for any lost coal,

125
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,390
so I checked very carefully.

126
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,360
No one was there.

127
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,190
A body was discovered.

128
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,680
Why did you have to be woken up twice?

129
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,680
I was too drowsy

130
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,600
to react.

131
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,870
Ding Baoyuan,

132
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,000
you've been in prison for eight years

133
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,560
and you've been appealing.

134
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,160
If you didn't do it,

135
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,160
who do you think did?

136
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,560
Can you give us police some clues?

137
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:22,560
There were only three of us
in the station.

138
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,600
If not me,

139
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,000
then it's Wang Liang or Liu Sancheng.

140
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,070
They could do it.

141
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,510
They had been guarding the furnace.

142
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:38,030
But I can't figure out

143
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,270
when the other person went in.

144
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,480
Did you know the victim, Cheng Chun?

145
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,480
No.

146
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,550
Think before you speak.

147
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,870
Cheng Chun was a widow

148
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,910
and ran a business on the street a

149
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,870
and had a lawsuit against her in-laws.

150
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,550
She's quite famous in our area.

151
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,360
I heard of her.

152
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,200
But I don't know her.

153
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,360
Are you sure?

154
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,360
Yes.

155
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,870
Ding Baoyuan, do you recognize me?

156
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,510
Officer Chen.

157
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,120
A confession under duress.

158
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,240
What did you say?

159
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:22,440
A confession under duress.
I was forced to confess.

160
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,320
We held you down at Chunyu Inn

161
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,790
and you confessed to killing her.

162
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,630
Who forced a confession out of you?

163
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,120
The old cop.

164
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,320
You're talking nonsense.

165
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,270
When did the old cop ever touch you?

166
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,120
It was that old cop who made me confess.

167
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,480
He made me confess.

168
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,150
I'm here.

169
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,240
Don't you dare lie.

170
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,510
Dong Baoyuan,

171
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,670
slander is punishable by law.

172
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,600
Think carefully.

173
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,600
I didn't kill anyone.

174
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,630
I've been wrongly accused.

175
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,150
I didn't kill anyone.

176
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,030
I've been wrongly accused.

177
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,750
Chen,

178
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,750
why are you so angry?

179
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,200
That jerk slandered my master.

180
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:57,960
Is it possible

181
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,550
that Captain Ge did it
when you didn't see it?

182
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,390
What do you mean?

183
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,360
You think the cops in this little suburb

184
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,550
dare to do anything, don't you?

185
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,870
Do you know my master?

186
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,670
We had an officer on the force
who served for 15 years

187
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,270
and was punished
by Captain Ge for slapping

188
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,630
a suspect in the face.

189
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,360
All Ding Baoyuan's interrogations
were videotaped.

190
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,270
Look it up.

191
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:21,910
Ding Baoyuan and his wife
are really affectionate.

192
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,240
He's been in prison for eight years.

193
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,030
His wife is quite devoted.

194
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,200
But why did Sun Caiyun

195
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,630
marry

196
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,320
a man like Ding Baoyuan?

197
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,870
You mean why did she marry a cripple?

198
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,630
Ding Baoyuan's wife, Sun Caiyun,

199
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,750
came from Luoche.

200
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,840
Caiyun.

201
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,720
Caiyun.

202
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:53,630
Baoyuan.

203
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,120
Don't look.

204
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,750
Baoyuan!

205
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,870
Baoyuan.

206
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,030
Are you tired?

207
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,870
I'm fine.

208
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,080
Come to my place for dinner later.

209
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,440
Anything good?

210
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:14,720
Yeah, something good.

211
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,240
Coming!

212
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:18,600
Caiyun,

213
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,390
why don't you invite me for dinner?

214
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,960
Don't you have a home?

215
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,200
You go home and eat.

216
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,790
Don't disturb me. Go now.

217
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,360
Stop it.

218
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,030
Baoyuan,

219
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,550
Take me with you
when you go back to the town.

220
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,600
Aren't you doing good here?

221
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,960
What are you going to the town for?

222
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,720
Why do you think I'm going?

223
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,870
You can't do anything.

224
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,440
How can you live in the town?

225
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,200
I can't do anything?

226
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,320
I can do a lot of things.

227
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,750
I won't pester you.

228
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,670
I can write

229
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,150
and count.

230
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,600
I can be a waitress.

231
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,750
Take me with you.

232
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,360
What are you doing?

233
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,600
What are you doing?

234
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,000
Stop it.

235
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,120
Stop it.

236
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,270
All right.

237
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,510
Let me think about it.

238
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,840
Where's my jumper?
Give me my jumper.

239
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,790
You're not fooling me, are you?

240
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,550
If you try to fool me,

241
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,150
I won't let you go.

242
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,270
Caiyun,

243
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,320
Ding, the guy who set up the pole,

244
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,030
fell off the pole.

245
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,480
What's his condition, Doctor?

246
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,390
Who is the injured man to you?

247
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,670
My man.

248
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:06,750
Your man?

249
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,600
Do you have children?

250
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,750
What do you mean?

251
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,360
Before he fell,

252
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,120
his body was subjected
to a high voltage shock.

253
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:16,270
There's a high probability that
his fertility may have been impaired.

254
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,720
Which means he...

255
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,360
He won't be able to have children?

256
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,790
It's not entirely impossible.

257
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,150
There's just such a possibility.

258
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,960
As the patient's family,

259
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,440
you have to be prepared for this.

260
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,550
Are you sure about that?

261
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,240
It's not entirely impossible.

262
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,240
What are you doing?

263
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,750
Nothing.

264
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,550
You want to pee?

265
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,440
Let me help you.

266
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,240
Let me help you.

267
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:45,840
Caiyun.

268
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,790
Let me help you.

269
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:47,510
Let go.

270
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,360
Let me help you.

271
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,390
It's not appropriate, Caiyun.

272
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,550
What's not appropriate?

273
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,720
I have seen every part of you.

274
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,720
Let me help you.

275
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,270
You peed.

276
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,150
Sun Caiyun married

277
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,510
Ding Baoyuan,
who had a county household register.

278
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,910
On the day of the wedding,

279
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:03,320
a group of Ding Baoyuan's relatives

280
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,240
collided with a big lorry
on the way back to the town,

281
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,910
and none of them survived.

282
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,390
Ding Baoyuan inherited a large fortune,

283
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,440
and Sun Caiyun became an idle wife.

284
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,120
She played mahjong

285
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,790
and did square dancing every day.

286
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,440
Ding Baoyuan was sentenced
to death with reprieve

287
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,790
and is in prison.

288
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,320
Sun Caiyun is in charge of his property.

289
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,030
Sounds like a real lottery winner.

290
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,080
In these eight years,

291
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,240
Sun Caiyun has lived alone?

292
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,240
You're asking me?

293
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,030
Alone?

294
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:20,120
You think she's a virtuous woman?

295
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,510
That's not very nice to say.

296
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,630
But since Ding Baoyuan went to prison,

297
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,360
her bed

298
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,120
has never been empty.

299
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,440
Sun Caiyun

300
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,870
lives with

301
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,910
Guan Qiao openly.

302
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,390
Guan Qiao?

303
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,750
Yes.

304
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,750
Everyone knows about this.

305
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,000
They've been in and out
of the house openly,

306
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,960
cuddling in front of everyone.

307
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,720
And they call each other Honey.

308
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,600
That's how shameless and bold they are.

309
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,670
Cuckold, watch where you're going.

310
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,030
Sorry.

311
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:05,910
Sorry.

312
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,240
Zhao,

313
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,150
why did you call Baoyuan a cuckold?

314
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,030
You're new here so you don't know.

315
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,600
Baoyuan

316
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,440
has a good wife

317
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:26,030
who takes his money and keeps a toy boy.

318
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,320
She even publishes a book
for her toy boy.

319
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,600
Their friends are all educated.

320
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:34,440
Cuckold,

321
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,000
tell us what's going on.

322
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,870
Speak.

323
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,000
Cuckold

324
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,790
is green.

325
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,510
What are you talking about?

326
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,320
Report.

327
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,960
I told them a joke.

328
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,150
Watch your discipline.

329
00:16:59,150 --> 00:16:59,960
Quiet.

330
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,720
Yes.

331
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:29,300
[Sandstorm]

332
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:45,880
Madam Song,

333
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,480
What does Guan Qiao do for a living?

334
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,110
He's a punk in the town.

335
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,790
If he can't fool others,
then he fools Sun Caiyun.

336
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,000
Sun Caiyun

337
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,440
told us he's a writer.

338
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,480
Since Guan Qiao's been with Sun Caiyun,

339
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,960
he doesn't need to find a job

340
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,550
and just stays
at Sun Caiyun's house all day long.

341
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,960
Sun Caiyun is keeping him.

342
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,270
When did they start?

343
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,790
You mean, sleeping together?

344
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:12,640
No.

345
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,960
When did they meet?

346
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,070
I have no idea.

347
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,550
Madam Song,

348
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,830
that's not what you said
in your statement eight years ago.

349
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,750
What did I say?

350
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,480
You said they had a harmonious family.

351
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:26,510
Well,

352
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,510
they say it's better to tear down
ten temples than to destroy a family.

353
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,440
Sun Caiyun

354
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,110
keeps going to visit her husband
in prison every month

355
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,270
while she's having an affair
with someone else.

356
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,920
Why?

357
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,960
She wants it all.

358
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,440
What does she want?

359
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:48,030
Ding Baoyuan has an ex-wife

360
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,350
and a daughter.

361
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,200
Inmates' families

362
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,200
have only one chance
to visit them per month.

363
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,720
If they can't visit,
they can write letters.

364
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,000
Letters that will make
the inmates' emotions fluctuate

365
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,070
are not accessible to them.

366
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,880
If Ding Baoyuan

367
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,720
already knew that Sun Caiyun
has been cheating on him,

368
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:15,030
his emotional control today was good.

369
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,070
If a man's been in prison
for eight years unjustly,

370
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,640
can he still look so docile?

371
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:27,590
Resigned to his fate?

372
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,240
Then why does he insist on appealing?

373
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,920
It's just my instincts.

374
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,310
You've started solving cases
on instincts, huh?

375
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:57,830
Little Chick.

376
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,310
Caiyun, that's a nice coat.

377
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,200
What brand?

378
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,680
It must be a brand.

379
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,920
I'm telling you,
there's a difference between with

380
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,070
and without a brand.

381
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,310
Same as people.

382
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,350
Those who are educated
and those who aren't

383
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,880
talk differently.

384
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,590
What's this?

385
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,880
Caiyun, someone's looking for you.

386
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,350
Who's looking for me?

387
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,680
Officer Chen, you've transferred back
from Luoche?

388
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,110
Chen, when did you come back?

389
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,720
I came back for some business.

390
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,160
How are you?

391
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,110
Little Chick.

392
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,830
How good can life be
for an orphan and a widow?

393
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:35,790
Just like this.

394
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,200
Ding Baoyuan is alive and well.

395
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,720
You're not an orphan and a widow.

396
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:42,030
My husband committed a crime,

397
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,680
he should be in there.

398
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,960
Aren't my son and I

399
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,720
an orphan and a widow out here?

400
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,240
You visit him in prison every month

401
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,680
and you're living with another man.

402
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,720
Aren't you afraid
that Ding Baoyuan will find out?

403
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,070
Officer Chen,

404
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,790
you're a man, I'm a woman.

405
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,160
We all have feelings and desires, right?

406
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:08,440
I'm too young to be a widow.

407
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,240
Besides, I'm not in anyone's way.

408
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,590
Just don't get in the way of the law.

409
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,030
You can only
get one marriage certificate.

410
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,200
I know. No bigamy.

411
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,590
Eight of Characters.

412
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,070
Eight of Characters.

413
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:23,960
Who is she?

414
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,640
Hi, I'm Luo.

415
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,110
A police officer
from the municipal office.

416
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,960
Hi, I'm Sun.

417
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,960
You're certainly from the town.
Your hands are so soft.

418
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,350
You haven't done much work, have you?

419
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,510
What kind of skin care products
do you use?

420
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:40,270
She came from the municipal office
for supervision.

421
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,030
People from the town

422
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,240
are different from us.

423
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:50,030
You must have read a lot.

424
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,960
Ever read a web novel?

425
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,480
I'm busy. I don't read much novels.

426
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,110
Have you read Haunted Love?

427
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,000
It's a big hit.
It's over a billion views.

428
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,510
No.

429
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,720
What about Tears of Sorrow?

430
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:04,400
No.

431
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,790
You must have read Sandstorm, then.

432
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:11,880
It's a physical book. It's popular.

433
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,640
Six of Bamboos.

434
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,310
I'll buy a couple of copies and read it.

435
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,960
No, I'll give it to you later.

436
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:17,680
Do you want it?

437
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:20,960
Look at the tiles I have.

438
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:21,830
Should I take it?

439
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:22,550
Chen.

440
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,400
Give away Four Dots.

441
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:24,440
Chen,

442
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:25,480
get down to business.

443
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,350
Sun Caiyun,

444
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,590
Ding Baoyuan was imprisoned
eight years ago,

445
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:36,310
and the next year he appealed,

446
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:38,400
saying that he didn't commit the murder
at the heating station.

447
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,400
You know about this, don't you?

448
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,830
That's the kind of a man

449
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:44,000
my husband is.

450
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,270
He just won't admit it.

451
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:48,160
Since he appealed,

452
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,350
we have to investigate.

453
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,720
We can't let a bad guy go

454
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,270
and we can't frame a good guy.

455
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:52,750
After

456
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,750
the murder at the heating station,

457
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,960
what did he say and do

458
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,720
when he got home?

459
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,510
Tell Officer Luo everything.

460
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,440
Sit down.

461
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,640
You want to interrogate me?

462
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,960
If we wanted to interrogate you,
it wouldn't be in here.

463
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,920
We're just trying
to find out what's going on.

464
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,240
Just say it.

465
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,480
It's been a long time.

466
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,640
I can't remember.

467
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,750
What did you tell us eight years ago?

468
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,440
Say it.

469
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,400
Are you testing me, Chen?

470
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:28,110
Okay, for your sake,
I'll think about it.

471
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,830
It's all right, take your time.

472
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:33,960
Six Dots.

473
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,240
I remember now.

474
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:44,310
That night, when I came home
from the square dancing,

475
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,720
I ran into Ma Jincai.

476
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,720
You remember Ma Jincai, don't you?

477
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,920
Go ahead.

478
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,550
Ma Jincai

479
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,510
is a lecher.

480
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,640
As soon as I came into town with Ding,

481
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,790
he was eyeing me up.

482
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,960
Who was I?

483
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,480
A virtuous woman.

484
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,720
How could I let him get to me?

485
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,110
Unfortunately,
I ran into him that night.

486
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:09,200
He took me in his arms
and kissed me and hugged me.

487
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:11,160
He even tore my clothes.

488
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,480
I was so pissed off.

489
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,000
While I was struggling,

490
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,790
Ding went home.

491
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,550
I heard he went home.

492
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,070
Then I called him

493
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:21,550
and I told him.

494
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,960
I didn't mind after the call.

495
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,640
I woke up the next morning

496
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,880
and there was an incident
at the heating station.

497
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,960
I'd like to know what was going on.

498
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,070
But it turned out

499
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,720
to be Ding's the murderer.

500
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,400
What a mess.

501
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,350
I won.

502
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,830
You won again. I'm so unlucky.

503
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:41,310
Tell us more.

504
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,510
After the murder

505
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,720
at the heating station eight years ago,

506
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,640
what did your husband tell you

507
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,750
when he got home?

508
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,350
He didn't say anything, just normal.

509
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,720
He ran away in a couple of days.

510
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,030
Don't you think it's scary?

511
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:04,070
A murderer suddenly sleeps next to you

512
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,480
in the middle of the night.

513
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,350
How scary.

514
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,480
In case he has the evil intention and...

515
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,590
Isn't it scary?

516
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,000
Say something that will help.

517
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:15,270
Was there anything unusual
before he ran away?

518
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:17,030
What did he tell you when he left?

519
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:24,880
On the way out, he said something to me

520
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,310
that sounded like a goodbye.

521
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,270
He said not to open the door

522
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,880
to strangers

523
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,270
when I'm home alone.

524
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:38,590
Mom.

525
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,720
Zhuangzhuang.

526
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,000
Baby, you're back.

527
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,640
My son has finished school.
That's it for today.

528
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,960
I've got to make dinner for my son.

529
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,110
You won and you're running away.

530
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,110
Let's play for a while.

531
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,590
Don't we always win or lose?

532
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:58,640
A writer?

533
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:01,310
Who are you?

534
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,920
Chen.

535
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,880
An old cop in Kulu.

536
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,160
An old friend of mine.

537
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,000
Officer Chen.

538
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:10,880
Just call me Chen.

539
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,550
Your handbag.

540
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:14,590
Thank you.

541
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,440
You wrote Sandstorm,
didn't you, Guan Qiao?

542
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:19,790
Yes.

543
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:20,510
Hi.

544
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,880
I thought you said
you didn't read novels.

545
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,480
How old are you?

546
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,550
Seven.

547
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:36,200
Chen, is there anything else
you want to ask?

548
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,240
Are we done?

549
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,000
Here's my business card.

550
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,110
Call me anytime

551
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,400
if you think of anything.

552
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,110
Luo Yingwei.

553
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,920
All right, we'll get going now.

554
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,110
Say goodbye to Uncle.

555
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,480
Goodbye, Uncle.

556
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,070
Bye.

557
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:49,720
Let's go.

558
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,680
Aren't you afraid of getting heaty
from eating so many peanuts?

559
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,030
It's good. Try it.

560
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,110
No, thanks.

561
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:07,590
Sun Caiyun is a typical performer.

562
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,640
Did you verify

563
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,000
what she just said?

564
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,680
Didn't you read all the files?

565
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:16,440
I didn't read about Ma Jincai.

566
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,400
Ding Baoyuan ran away at that time.

567
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,750
Get in the car.

568
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,200
Editor-in-chief, Zhao,
made a deal with me

569
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,920
to hold a book launch in the town

570
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,240
for 1,000 people.

571
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,240
This must be the first time

572
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,480
a book launch has taken place in Kulu.

573
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,880
What do you think if it sells...

574
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,790
Dad, I want to see the toys.

575
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,350
Why do you want toys again?

576
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,350
We have so many toys at home.

577
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:47,070
Silly woman!

578
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,960
Are you going
to do your homework or not?

579
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,270
Zhuangzhuang, go ahead and pick it out.

580
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:53,110
I'll pay when you're done.

581
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,070
Don't let Zhuangzhuang

582
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:59,880
call you Dad when we're outside.

583
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:03,880
What's wrong?
You look so glum all the way.

584
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,070
Those two cops were here

585
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,440
for Ding Baoyuan's case.

586
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:12,030
He's been saying he's innocent
for five or six years in prison,

587
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,590
and I didn't expect an investigation
to actually take place.

588
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,590
He's been locked up for so long,

589
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,240
what's the use of appealing now?

590
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:23,920
Don't frown.

591
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,830
What are you doing? We're on the street.

592
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,030
Have you picked it out yet?

593
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,240
Which one?

594
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,070
A car.

595
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,000
Okay. How much?

596
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,790
20 yuan.

597
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:36,440
Here you go.

598
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:39,830
Let's go.

599
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,030
Stop there.

600
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,790
Walk after five seconds.

601
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,720
My boy.

602
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,030
Zhuangzhuang.

603
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,270
Here it is.

604
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,520
Ma Jincai!

605
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,000
Stop there, Ma Jincai!

606
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:13,840
Ma Jincai!

607
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,390
Stop there, Ma Jincai!

608
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:15,630
Let me pull up my trousers.

609
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:16,270
Don't run.

610
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,600
Go back. Why are you chasing after me?

611
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,600
Why are you chasing after me?

612
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,350
Your husbands will break your legs.

613
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:19,950
Jincai!

614
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,760
Chen. Officer Chen.

615
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,000
Listen, the cop is here.

616
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,550
He'll arrest you guys.

617
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,390
What are they doing?

618
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,520
Go back.

619
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,390
Your husbands will break your legs. Go.

620
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:29,190
A view of the village.

621
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,190
He harassed them.

622
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:34,990
What have you done?

623
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,070
They took advantage of me, Chen.

624
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,640
When did you come back?

625
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,510
Watch out, their husbands
will break your legs.

626
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:42,510
Break your legs.

627
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,990
They harassed me.

628
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:45,160
Have one.

629
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:45,880
No.

630
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:47,680
I'll go inside

631
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:49,640
and have some tea.

632
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,120
I don't have good tea.

633
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:54,440
She said I harassed her

634
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,840
and she was struggling?

635
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,360
That's what Sun Caiyun said.

636
00:29:58,750 --> 00:29:59,920
That's true.

637
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,120
I'm warning you, Ma Jincai.

638
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,550
It's a murder case.
You want to be involved?

639
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:06,230
Chen.

640
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,070
Chen.

641
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,200
I don't even dare to kill a chicken,

642
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,840
how can I kill someone?

643
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,070
Right?

644
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:12,990
To tell you the truth,

645
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:15,640
she was the one
who seduced me that night.

646
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:16,960
I didn't flirt with her.

647
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:20,030
Sun Caiyun

648
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,270
is from the countryside

649
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:22,920
but she has high standards.

650
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,840
She got

651
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,400
Ding Baoyuan,
the manager of the heating station,

652
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:28,400
and she never looked me in the eye.

653
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,920
She was the one
who came to me that night.

654
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,200
Sit down.

655
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:40,310
What time did she go to you that night?

656
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,600
9:30 PM.

657
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,990
I heard someone knocking on the door,

658
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,160
and I wondered who was looking for me
in the middle of the night.

659
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:47,960
Who's there?

660
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:49,360
Who?

661
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:54,360
It's Caiyun.

662
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,840
Why are you here so late?

663
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,310
What are you doing?

664
00:30:59,030 --> 00:30:59,990
I'm ready for bed.

665
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:01,200
So early?

666
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:03,030
I'm all alone.

667
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,880
You're not going to bed?

668
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:06,960
Ding

669
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,920
has gone to work.

670
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,710
was bored of being alone

671
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,750
and came to see you.

672
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:11,840
Come on, let's go to my house.

673
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,680
I'll relieve you of your boredom.

674
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,360
I'll relieve you of your boredom.

675
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,990
Your hands are so dirty.

676
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:17,840
Can't you find

677
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,990
a cleaner place for me?

678
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,990
All right. Why don't we go to Malanhua?

679
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:25,840
Well, go there and take a shower
and wait for me.

680
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,070
See you.

681
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,790
Don't fool me.

682
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,030
Go now.

683
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:31,960
Promise.

684
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,400
Just go.

685
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:37,360
Chen,

686
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,510
who wouldn't eat free meat, right?

687
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,710
I got a room

688
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:45,400
at Malanhua Hotel

689
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,440
in our county. It cost me 30 yuan.

690
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:51,030
I asked her over to have some fun.

691
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,120
I went to her again in a couple of days,
but she avoided me.

692
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,030
When she got desperate,

693
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,840
she got some thugs to beat me up.

694
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,680
I didn't dare to look for her again.

695
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,160
That's what happened.

696
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,440
Ma Jincai

697
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,880
is usually very frugal.

698
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:12,550
Suddenly, he paid
for a room at my place.

699
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,120
I was puzzled.

700
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,360
I asked him, but he didn't tell me.

701
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,640
Not long after he went in,

702
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,120
Ding Baoyuan's wife came in

703
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,920
with a scarf covering her face.

704
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,710
That's when I knew the two of them
were sleeping together.

705
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,960
Someone really doesn't mind.

706
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:38,310
As long as it's not her husband,

707
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,710
it's a good man, huh?

708
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:43,400
Sun Caiyun was the one
who seduced me that night.

709
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,160
I went to her again in a couple of days,
but she avoided me.

710
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,510
I went to see Ma Jincai
under the influence of booze.

711
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:50,160
But I looked for him for over an hour
and I couldn't find him.

712
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,510
Since Guan Qiao

713
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:52,880
has been with Sun Caiyun,

714
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,070
he doesn't need to find a job.

715
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,310
Sun Caiyun is keeping him.

716
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,840
Are you sure it was that night?

717
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,120
Yes.

718
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,360
A person fell out
of the furnace the next day.

719
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,510
That's why I remember it so clearly.

720
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,920
It's scary.

721
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,750
[Malanhua]

722
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,160
Chen,

723
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:22,960
Sun Caiyun

724
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,750
slept with a lecher, Ma Jincai,

725
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:27,270
in order to trick her husband,
Ding Baoyuan.

726
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:29,070
What was she thinking?

727
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,710
Because of her lover, Guan Qiao.

728
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:36,550
She's got a lover, Guan Qiao,

729
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:38,070
and she's still sleeping
with another guy?

730
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:41,070
There are many reasons
for someone to lie,

731
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,640
so why did she have to use this one?

732
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,360
Besides,

733
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,310
Ding Baoyuan was fooled
on the first day,

734
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:47,640
but wasn't she afraid of being caught

735
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:48,960
on the second and third?

736
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:49,880
She wasn't.

737
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:51,680
Why?

738
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,120
Because after they slept together,

739
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,920
Sun Caiyun is at ease.

740
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:01,920
Turning a lecher into an adulterer.

741
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,710
Ma Jincai will definitely
avoid Ding Baoyuan.

742
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,640
What kind of logic is this?

743

00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,110
Kulu, this small county,

More than a decade ago,

there were iron mines in Nanshan.

750
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:35,240
With the mining spree,
the resources were dwindling,

751
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,320
and more and more people were leaving.

to that in the town?

00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:54,510
you're too honest.

928
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,800
You just won't talk back.

929
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:12,440
Listen here.

930
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,470
Being too honest

931
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,550
in this world will get you bullied.

932
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:35,320
Have another bowl.

933
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:38,510
Thank you.

934
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:43,720
You came to my place
at this time of night.

935
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,070
Doesn't your mum cook for you?

936
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,110
My mum's long dead.

937
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,070
You brat!

938
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,360
I'll wipe it off for you.

939
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:02,720
No.

940
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:04,470
What a wimp.

941
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:06,550
Watch what you do.

942
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:12,990
Come in.

943
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,320
Come in and wash up.

944
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:48,800
I'll wipe it for you.

945
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:53,720
What's your name?

946
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:55,760
Fu.

947
00:48:58,190 --> 00:48:59,110
How old are you?

948
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:01,920
20.

949
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,400
What are you staring at?

950
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:19,280
