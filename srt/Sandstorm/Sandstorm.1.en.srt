We caught them this morning.

00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,390
We're questioning them.

81
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
Right here?

82
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,430
There's no audio or video recording.

83
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,040
It doesn't comply with
the procedure, does it?

84
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,870

85
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,360

87
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,240
No, Chief Liang.

88
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,390
We're hungry from catching thieves.

89
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,630
So we came for a pot of hot tea.

90
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,310
We're taking them back to the station.

91
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,830

00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,630
Officer Luo has a car. Don't worry.

96
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,920

97
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,270

103
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,720
Ding Baoyuan,
who was found guilty at the time...

104
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,190
Thank you.

He began to appeal the year
after the judgment

106
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,390
came into effect

107
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,390
and has been appealing for seven years.

108
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,430
He's appealed to the Supreme
People's Procuratorate (SPP).

109
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,870
The SPP commissioned the Provincial
Prosecutor's Office to review the case.

110
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:35,960
Review?

111
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,360
It's not necessary.

112
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,440
He's the murderer.

113
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,870
I've read the entire case file,

114
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,840
and there is reasonable doubt
in this case.

115
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,200
Director Wei
of the Provincial Office asked us

116
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,080
to review the case.

117
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,360
The Provincial Office wants us

118
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,630
to review the case
before the comrades

119
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,120
from the Provincial
Prosecutor's Office arrive.

120
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,440
We need to re-verify the evidence
from that year,

121
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,870
sort out the chain of evidence

122
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,320
and remove reasonable doubt.

123
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,960
If it turns out

124
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,750
that Ding Baoyuan wasn't the murderer,

125
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,480
we'll be able to rectify the situation.

126
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,840
My master is the one
working on this case.

127
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,960
Is the Provincial Office so distrustful

of him?

129
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,030
It's not about trust.

130
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:16,910
It's about evidence.

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,510

132
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,630

Didn't you read the full case file?

161
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:49,960
I need you to corroborate.

162
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,510
It happened on 26 February.

163

165

It was reported at 5:35 AM.

167

At 6:13 AM, my master arrived
at Heating Station No. 2

169
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:22,600
There was a sandstorm

Go ahead.

174
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,480
Nonsense.

175
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,840
I'll try my best.

176
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,320
Honey, I got it.

177
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,480
You've taken the trouble.

178

184
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,790
Has it been here the whole time?

185

It arrived at 5:30 AM.

186
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:48,790

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,200
There's been a murder.

192
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:04,960
Who let them in?

193
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,240
Well, I let them in.

194
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,720
They're here to deliver coal.

195
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,200
There's a rule at the factory

196
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,840
that the coal must be unloaded
when it arrives.

197
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,720
Who discovered the body first?

198
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,870
The two workers on the night shift.

199
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,080
That's Mr. Liu.

200
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,360
That kid is Wang Liang.

201
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,200
Who are those guys?

202
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,550
The two in uniforms

203
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,910
are the day shift workers,

204
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,000
the other two are the coal drivers.

205
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,840
Tell me about your station.

206
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,790
There are seven of us

207
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,750
at the heating station, including me.

208
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,480
Six workers in three shifts.

209
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,600
I'm in charge.

210
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,240
Last night,

211
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,270
Mr. Liu

212
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,000
and his apprentice were
on the night shift.

213
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,670
Only three of us were in the station.

214
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,670
In the morning, when the slag came out,

215
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,550
a body suddenly fell out.

216
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,200
Can outsiders come in?

217
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,080
Outsiders can't get in.

218
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,600
This gate

219
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,790
is locked from the inside.

220
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,600
There's only one key,

221
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,750
and I have it all the time.

222
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,320
I usually lock the gate

223
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,000
at 10 PM when the night shift workers

224
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,080
take over.

225
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,360
But last night, I was a bit late,

226
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,600
I locked it around 11 PM.

227
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:14,670
Why?

228
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,080
What's the point of having strict rules

229
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,510
for a furnace room?

230
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,600
It's mainly because we're afraid
of losing coal.

231
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,000
A lot of people around here

232
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,120
can't afford to install heaters,

233
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,200
so they burn coal
in their cookers to keep warm.

234
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,960
In the worst cases,
half a truckload of coal

235
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,200
can be lost.

236
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:30,870
We'll have to pay for all the damage.

237
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,440
If outsiders aren't allowed in,

238
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,840
can the people inside get out?

239
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,360
No, they can't.

240
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,790
There's been a case

241
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,390
where a night shift worker
snuck out for a drink

242
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,790
and the furnace went out.

243
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,270
And there's been a case of stealing coal

244
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,960
by the station staff.

245
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,600
How can you be sure
there's only one key?

246
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:50,790
When the new lock was bought,

247
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,120
only one was given
to the station manager.

248
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,000
The rest were destroyed in public.

249
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,510
Several of us station managers
have shared experiences,

250
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,270
so we all do the same.

251
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,240
Captain Ge,

252
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,720
there are some footprints.

253
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,550
No sign of dragging.

254
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,550
The crime scene has been
too badly damaged.

255
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,000
Check this wall

256
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,590
for signs of climbing.

257
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:10,550
Okay, I'll check it now.

258
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,200
Captain Ge,

259
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,480
the body was so badly burnt,

260
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,070
the preliminary judgment
is that it's a woman.

261
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,720
Mr. Ge.

262
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,480
How's it? Are you feeling better?

263
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,790
Yes.

264
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,350
Take him inside and question him.

265
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,110
Okay.

266
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,240
Thank you.

267
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,960
You know this kid?

268
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,830
He's also from Luoche like you.

269
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,030
It's a small society

270
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,110
within these walls.

271
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,720
Other people may think nothing
of a job at a heating station.

272
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,070
But it's a good job

273
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,790
in this small county.

274
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:30,750
It's a secure job.

275
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:41,920
So far,

276
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,000
we haven't received a report.

277
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,880
So we can't confirm
the victim's identity.

278
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,790
According
to the preliminary forensic results,

279
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,070
[Furnace Homicide]
the victim is a woman

280
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,110
in her thirties,

281
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,680
about 1.6 metres tall

282
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,590
and weighs about 50 kilos.

283
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,160
But the exact cause of death
could not be confirmed.

284
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,400
Wang, tell us more about it.

285
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,590
Due to the fact that the victim's
epidermis and part of her torso

286
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,750
had been burnt,

287
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,480
no superficial injuries were visible.

288
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,480
The trace of soot in the victim's lungs

289
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,790
can be explained by the fact

290
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,720
that the victim
may have been breathing lightly

291
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,440
when she was stuffed
into the furnace.

292
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,830
It can also be explained

293
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,640
as a natural formation

294
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,680
during prolonged combustion processes.

295
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:25,400
Heating Station No. 2
is a completely enclosed environment.

296
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,270
The general rule is

297
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,920
that no one is allowed to go out

298
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,270
after 10 PM.

299
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:33,240
The key is in the hands
of station manager, Ding Baoyuan.

300
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,720
The heating station
is surrounded by a tall fence.

301
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,240
No signs of climbing were found

302
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,000
after the scene investigation.

303
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,400
[Ding Baiyuan, Liu Sancheng, Wang Liang]
These three were on duty last night.

304
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,590
Ding Baoyuan is 44 years old.

305
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,790
He used to work at the power station.

306
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,480
A year ago, he was injured at work

307
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,590
and transferred to the heating station.

308
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:54,270
During the seven-month heating period,

309
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,790
the station manager has to live and eat
at the heating station

310
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:57,830
and lead the shifts.

311
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,160
The rule is that the station manager
must be on duty

312
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,200
24 hours a day.

313
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,720
But the factory knows

314
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,680
that the station manager
has family and commitments.

315
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:09,510
Here.

316
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,160
Have some water.

317
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,550
Hence,

318
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,510
as long as the station manager
is on duty at night,

319
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,270
he can go out during the day.

320
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,110
I went out last night around 9 PM

321
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,830
and came back around 11 PM.

322
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,160
When I got back, I locked the gate

323
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,200
and went round the furnace room,

324
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,350
then I came back to bed.

325
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,880
I slept

326
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,030
until Wang Liang called me at dawn.

327
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,400
He called you twice before you got up.

328
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,480
He told you something bad happened.
Why didn't you get up right away?

329
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,790
Wang Liang

330
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,960
didn't make it clear either.

331
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,510
I didn't think
it would be such a big deal.

332
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,790
I thought he was just kidding around.

333
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,440
Why did you let the coal truck in

334
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,830
when there was a murder?

335
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,440
When I woke up,
the truck was already there,

336
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,640
and the drivers
were banging on the gate.

337
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,510
We have a rule at the factory

338
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,310
that the coal has to be unloaded
when it arrives.

339
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,350
[Safety First]
Hello? Police station?

340
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,920
- I want to report a crime.
- Open the gate!

341
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,920
This is Heating Station No. 2.

342
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:02,640
Yes.

343
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:05,510
Hello? This is Heating Station No. 2!

344
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,640
Here comes the coal truck.

345
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,960
Liu Sancheng and Wang Liang
are the master and apprentice.

346
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,790
[Liu Sancheng: Staff, Wang Liang: Staff]
Liu Sancheng is 54 years old,

347
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:16,880
Wang Liang is 20 years old.

348
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,880
They were the two
on night duty last night.

349
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:21,510
The body was stuffed into the furnace

350
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,310
while they were on duty.

351
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,720
There's no sign
of it being any different than usual.

352
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,590
Wang Liang and I took over our shift,

353
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,550
filled the furnace with coal,

354
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,440
and sat down to play chess.

355
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,550
Nothing happened all night.

356
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,640
But

357
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,680
who knew, when the slag came out,

358
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,350
we saw that.

359
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,550
Didn't you see anyone come in or out?

360
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:45,880
No.

361
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,680
We keep the gate locked at night.

362
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:51,750
The key is with the station manager.

363
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,240
It was about 11 PM

364
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,590
when he came back from outside.

365
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,640
He chatted with us

366
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,830
and went to bed on the first floor.

367
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,830
His quarters are on the second floor
of the furnace room.

368
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,830
Did he go out last night?

369
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:12,960
No.

370
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:18,310
Well, we were busy with the furnace

371
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,440
and playing chess,

372
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,720
so we didn't pay any attention
to the outside.

373
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:28,350
Yeah, it was about 9 PM.

374
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,240
At 9 PM,

375
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,000
he went out

376
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,030
across the yard.

377
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,510
But he

378
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,310
is the station manager.

379
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:38,960
He won't tell us
if he has anything to do.

380
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,200
Are the light bulbs in the yard fine?

381
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,440
They're lit up at night, right?

382
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,110
Right.

383
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:51,960
Is the door closed at night

384
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,790
when there's no sun?

385
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,920
I closed the door.

386
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,160
Where did you sit?

387
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,790
Can't you hear anything at night?

388
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,880
We were focused on our chess game.

389
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,550
Besides, this furnace

390
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,480
makes a lot of noise.

391
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,790
We can't hear anything.

392
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,920
I was sitting here.

393
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:43,680
How many rounds did you play?

394
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,790
Three.

395
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,510
Did you win

396
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,350
or lose?

397
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:50,830
I won.

398
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,400
How many rounds did you win?

399
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,680
Three.

400
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,720
You lost three rounds?

401
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:00,510
You're his master.

402
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
That won't do.

403
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,750
The furnace's coal inlet was so small,

404
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:10,070
so the body had to be shoved
through the rear slag box.

405
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,510
We've done experiments.

406
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,310
It takes a certain amount of skill

407
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,750
to open the rear slag box

408
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,110
and shove a 50-kg body in there

409
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,750
and turn it around in the furnace.

410
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:21,400
It was probably done
by the station staff.

411
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,590
Six sets of footprints have been
identified in the furnace room.

412
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,880
So far, five sets of footprints
have been identified

413
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,110
as belonging to the three men
who were on duty that night

414
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,680
and the two men
who delivered the coal the next morning.

415
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,000
According to them,

416
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,310
after discovering the body,

417
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,110
Wang Liang called for Ding Baoyuan,

418
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,510
and he ran in to check it out.

419
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,400
At that moment, the coal truck arrived.

420
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,720
The coal drivers heard
that a body had fallen

421
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,310
and came in to see what was going on.

422
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,480
The on-site investigation

423
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,200
proved the process they said it was.

424
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:49,510
Well,

425
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,480
the sixth set of footprints
are unidentifiable?

426
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:53,680
The sixth set of footprints

427
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,750
had been trampled
and covered almost completely

428
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,480
with soot by the fifth set.

429
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,350
Jianghe,

430
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,160
what do you think about it?

431
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,790
Two points are worth noting.

432
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,110
The first point is

433
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,240
whether the victim was completely dead

434
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,310
and stuffed in the oven

435
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,720
or whether there are
still signs of life.

436
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,160
The second point is to determine
the gender of the sixth set of footprints.

437
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,000
Ge,

438
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:18,110
looks like these three
from that night are the best suspects.

439
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,920
Let's start with them.

440
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,240
From what I've read in the case file,

441
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,160
you guys had been pinning

442
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,000
your suspicions
on Ding Baoyuan from the beginning.

443
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,790
Why?

444
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:28,920
The three of them,

445
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,640
Liu Sancheng and Wang Liang
are witnesses to each other,

446
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,960
but no one can bear witness
to Ding Baoyuan.

447
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,750
Liu Sancheng and Wang Liang

448
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,160
could be working together
to commit the crime.

449
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,720
How's that possible?

450
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,790
If the two of them worked together,

451
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,030
when the body fell out,

452
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,590
they could've just stuffed it
into the furnace

453
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,000
and burnt it to ashes.

454
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,550
How could they still
wake up Ding Baoyuan?

455
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,590
What else?

456
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,680
Besides,

457
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:49,070
the only key was on Ding Baoyuan.

458
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,960
Ding Baoyuan was called twice
before he woke up,

459
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,310
and more importantly,
he let the coal truck in.

460
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,480
The workers unloaded the coal

461
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,400
and went inside the furnace room
to look at the body.

462
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,720
The crime scene
was completely destroyed.

463
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,400
What you're saying
can only be called suspicion,

464
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,110
not evidence.

465
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,270
You've read the case file.

466
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,400
What does it say?

467
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,790
Ding Baoyuan let the coal truck in
early in the morning.

468
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,030
Several workers unloaded the coal.

469
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,790
They destroyed all the evidence
at the crime scene.

470
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,000
It's already written like this.
Is it still a suspicion?

471
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,920
I'm talking about physical evidence,

472
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,920
not speculation based on facts.

473
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,240
A sandstorm is coming!

474
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,110
Get the sheep back here now!

475
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:38,960
Run!

476
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,070
Run!

477
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:40,750
Run!

478
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:41,750
Honey, run!

479
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:58,110
Where are you going?

480
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,160
Qiusheng.

481
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,270
Move forward.

482
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,310
Could you tell me more

483
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,310
about the process
of identifying the victim?

484
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,480
Kulu isn't a big county,

485
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,310
but it's got a lot of transients.

486
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,030
We couldn't

487
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,070
identify

488
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,680
the victim for three days.

489
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,550
It was only on the fourth day
that we made any progress.

490
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:52,720
Captain Ge.

491
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,550
Master,

492
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,960
I'm almost breaking my legs
from investigating the case.

493
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:03,920
How's it?

494
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,680
The victim's been identified?

495
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,400
No.

496
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,270
I've been to ten neighbourhood
associations this morning.

497
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,510
Nobody's reported it.

498
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,750
I think she lived alone.

499
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:13,750
What do you reckon?

500
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,590
We have a permanent population
of 22,000 people.

501
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,160
It's strange if a family doesn't notice

502
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,070
a missing person

503
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:19,920
for two or three days.

504
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,750
That's why I think she lived alone.

505
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,920
Captain Ge, this woman reported

506
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,920
her widowed daughter-in-law,
Cheng Chun,

507
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,160
missing.

508
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,160
DNA later

509
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,110
proved that the victim was Cheng Chun.

510
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,200
As we were about to investigate

511
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,110
her movements and social connections,

512
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,000
something suddenly happened.

513
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:40,920
What's it?

514
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,310
Ding Baoyuan ran away.

515
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:49,480
Who's there?

516
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,750
Hi, we're from the police station
in Kulu County.

517
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:55,830
Is Ding Baoyuan home?

518
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:56,720
No.

519
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:01,790
Since Ding Baoyuan isn't here,

520
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,920
you have to come with us.

521
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,510
Where to?

522
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:08,510
[Wanted Notice]
Things went easy when he ran away.

523
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,790
You're pregnant. Sit down.

524
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,790
Make sure she sits down.

525
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,920
Help her.

526
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:23,960
Calm down. I just want
to ask you some questions.

527
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,200
What time did he go
to your house yesterday

528
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,000
to pack his things?

529
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,920
It's about night time,

530
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,110
11 PM or 12 PM.

531
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,000
Be precise.

532
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:43,590
Mister.

533
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,110
Boss, have you seen him lately?

534
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,400
Try to remember.

535
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,310
I've seen him over there.

536
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,480
Have you seen

537
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,550
this person?

538
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,350
After a month-long manhunt,

539
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:04,110
Ding Baoyuan turned up

540
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:04,880
in his hometown.

541
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,200
He used Cheng Chun's bank card

542
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,240
[China Post, Postal Savings Bank]
at an ATM.

543
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,960
My master took us there in a hurry.

544
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:16,310
The crippled man is Ding Baoyuan.

545
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:23,000
There's no surveillance at the ATM?

546
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,000
We don't have surveillance

547
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,920
on this ATM yet.

548
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,680
Madam,

549
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,830
how long have you been
setting up your stall here?

550
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,200
A couple of years.

551
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,200
Have you seen this man before?

552
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:45,920
Yes, I have.

553
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,550
When?

554
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,000
The day before yesterday,
he came to buy buns from me.

555
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,070
He's got mean eyes.

556
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,880
Are you telling the truth?

557
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,790
How can you be sure?

558
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,960
He's on the wanted notice.

559
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,240
He's a cripple, isn't he?

560
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,110
Why didn't you call the police?

561
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,310
I was afraid.

562
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:04,310
I run a small business.

563
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,750
With the ATM
as the center of the circle,

564
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:09,680
we narrowed down
Ding Baoyuan's area of activity,

565
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,960
and soon found out where he was.

566
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,510
Get him under control.

567
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,270
Don't move!

568
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,720
What's your name?

569
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,400
Speak!

570
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:27,830
Ding Baoyuan.

571
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,350
Do you know why you're being arrested?

572
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:32,790
Yes.

573
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:33,590
Ding Baoyuan.

574
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,590
You're suspected
of intentional homicide.

575
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:37,440
You're in criminal detention.

576
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,960
I confess. I did it.

577
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,030
Master, he confessed.

578
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,110
The case was solved.

579
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,590
We handed him over
to the Prosecutor's Office.

580
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:56,680
Six months later,

581
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:59,270
Ding Baoyuan was indicted

582
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:00,920
and given a death sentence with reprieve

583
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,110
for intentional homicide.

584
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:05,200
Throughout the trial,

585
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,480
he did not change his statement.

586
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:08,790
It's been eight years since the case,

587
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,960
and he's had his sentence commuted
from death with reprieve

588
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:12,880
to life imprisonment,

589
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,880
and then to 20 years' imprisonment.

590
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,270
Suddenly, he said
he didn't kill her today.

591
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,720
As I told you,

592
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,640
he started to appeal
the year after the judgment

593
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,880
came into force.

594
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:25,200
Why didn't he deny it during the trial?

595
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,510
Are you asking me?

596
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,310
I'm asking about this matter.

597
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,680
There are

598
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,590
many reasonable doubts in this case.

599
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:34,510
Officer Luo,

600
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:37,160
can you tell me

601
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,510
what reasonable doubts mean?

602
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,550
No first scene.

603
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:41,640
There was.

604
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,440
Ding Baoyuan let the coal truck

605
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:44,880
in.

606
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,030
The first scene was destroyed.

607
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:47,200
No murder weapon.

608
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,240
The coal shovel was the murder weapon.

609
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:53,350
It's been destroyed
while shoveling coal.

610
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,880
Ding Baoyuan and Cheng Chun
never crossed paths.

611
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,400
Then what's the motive for the crime?

612
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,640
Ding Baoyuan said
he had the wrong person,

613
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,350
that's why he got a death sentence
with reprieve.

614
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,480
How did Cheng Chun get in?

615
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,030
Isn't that an enclosed space?

616
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,790
He went out at night
and forgot to lock the door.

617
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:09,480
Fine.

618
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,000
Cheng Chun has no connection
with any of the three men in there.

619
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,240
At 11 o'clock at night,

620
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:14,920
what's a widow,

621
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,270
a widow who'd been
a clandestine prostitute,

622
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,400
doing at a heating station?

623
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,960
Did she really go to steal coal?

624
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,560
We also suspected
that she'd gone to the heating station

625
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,840
doing prostitution.

626
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,190
Luo,

627
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:30,120
I've been in this job
for almost 20 years.

628
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:32,200
I've seen and heard a lot.

629
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,360
I find

630
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,750
that sometimes people's behaviour

631
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:40,360
cannot be judged by normal logic.

632
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,000
I had a case like this.

633
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:47,110
A husband reported

634
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:49,750
his wife missing for a week

635
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:51,510
and didn't return home.

636
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:53,720
We went looking for her for three days.

637
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,590
When the wife came back,

638
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:56,920
we asked her where she'd been.

639
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,440
She said she saw a beautiful bird

640
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,400
she'd never seen before

641
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:01,640
and chased it

642
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,750
all the way to the mountain.

643
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:06,550
Can you imagine how long
she had been out of work?

644
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:08,230
That has nothing to do with this.

645
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,960
You're not getting it.

646
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,110
Anyway, it seems to me

647
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:15,440
that this is a classic case
of no criminal motive,

648
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,030
no physical evidence,

649
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,320
and a conviction
based solely on a confession.

650
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,320
There's physical evidence.

651
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,920
Ding Baoyuan took Cheng Chun's
bank card to withdraw money.

652
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,960
Where's the card?

653
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,480
Probably destroyed.

654
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,190
Probably?

655
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,150
Of course it's possible.

656
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,190
There's still no physical evidence.

657
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,110
There's a witness.

658
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,230
When he fled,

659
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,000
he told his wife
that he murdered someone.

660
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,230
When he was arrested,

661
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,550
he confessed to the murder.

662
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:33,920
If he didn't do it,

663
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,000
why did he run away?

664
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,230
Why did he confess?

665
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,320
Confessions have
limited probative value.

666
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:42,920
What are you trying to say?

667
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,550
No, what are you trying to say?

668
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,760
Are you trying to say
we made him confess under duress?

669
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,960
That's a very annoying look
on your face.

670
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,960
Nowadays, the rule of law is
about the benefit of the doubt.

671
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,840
Is it possible
that Ding Baoyuan committed murder?

672
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,230
Yes.

673
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,400
But can we prove it

674
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,400
based on the current evidence?

675
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,150
No.

676
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,760
So according to the principle
of benefit of the doubt...

677
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,960
Benefit of the doubt, my foot.

678
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:14,760
Comrade Chen Jianghe,

679
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,150
watch your attitude!

680
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:17,480
Qiusheng,

681
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,590
take me to Luoche Police Station!

682
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,840
Take your son along!

683
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:55,480
Are you hungry?

684
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:56,280
No.

685
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,230
What do we look like?

686
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,880
A big bear and a little bear.

687
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:12,870
We've arrived.

688
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,320
It's very windy.

689
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:20,920
Come on.

690
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,200
Take the mutton and blood.

691
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,000
Why are you giving them to me?

692
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:31,800
I'm glad the thieves were caught.

693
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,110
It's a token of appreciation. Take them.

694
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,160
Don't mention it.

695
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,750
We're glad we caught
the sheep thieves, too.

696
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:36,160
Yeah.

697
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:38,200
You're back, Chen.

698
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,510
It's too windy and sandy.

699
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,640
I think it's the day before yesterday.

700
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,510
Song.

701
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,790
Let's get Zhang Wenke something to eat

702
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,190
and we'll take a statement from him.

703
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,190
Okay.

704
00:36:58,710 --> 00:36:59,600
- Come on, Zhang Wenke.
- Qiusheng.

705
00:36:59,600 --> 00:36:59,920
Thank you.

706
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,640
Have a seat.

707
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,360
Thank you.

708
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,430
You're back.

709
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:16,720
Jianghe.

710
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:18,880
Jianghe, come here.

711
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,110
I've brought back the sheep thieves.

712
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:22,750
Good.

713
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:23,960
I need to talk to you.

714
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:24,520
What's it?

715
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,600
Look at this.

716
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:27,830
Commissioner Liu

717
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,350
just called me.

718
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:31,600
This is an order.

719
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,240
You have to get to Kulu today.

720
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:34,910
Today?

721
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:37,390
You're one of the officers
who worked on that case back in the day.

722
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:38,960
Commissioner Liu wants you
to come back to Kulu

723
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,720
and cooperate with us
in investigating this case.

724
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:44,840
[Kulu Police Station, Transfer Letter]
That's it?

725
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:46,510
That's it. Nothing more.

726
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:49,230
Okay.

727
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,800
Luo,

728
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:54,960
be patient.

729
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,230
Jianghe

730
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,760
will come with you as soon as he's dealt

731
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,510
with the sheep thieves.

732
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,150
Song,

733
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,550
I'm going to Kulu.

734
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:01,550
You're in charge here.

735
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,440
Okay, Chen.

736
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,230
And then?

737
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:05,190
I replied to him...

738
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,550
I'll buy them.

739
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,760
Buy?

740
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,550
Take the money.

741
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:10,360
I can't take this.

742
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,150
Why?

743
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,360
It's a token of appreciation.

744
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,550
I can't take your money.

745
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,230
It's not for you.

746
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,360
It's for Zhang Wenke.

747
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,440
For him to buy some books and food.

748
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:20,320
It would be hard to catch
sheep thieves without him.

749
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,960
But it's found.

750
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,710
That's true.

751
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,320
Okay, just be careful.

752
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:26,110
Zhang Wenke.

753
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:26,920
Zhang Wenke.

754
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,110
-Say thank you to Mr. Chen.
-Thank you, Mr. Chen.

755
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:28,840
He gave you money.

756
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,550
I'm leaving. Bye.

757
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,280
Bye.

758
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,320
All right. Bye.

759
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,920
Chief Liang, these are the statements
of the sheep thieves.

760
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:44,710
Please have a look.

761
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,550
Where is Jianghe?

762
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,550
He's just left.

763
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,800
Where to?

764
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,150
To Kulu.

765
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:51,360
Stop your car!

766
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,920
Stop your car!

767
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,030
Stop your car!

768
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,510
Stop your car!

769
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:02,360
Get on the road!

770
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,150
Stop your car!

771
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,320
You have a death wish, huh?

772
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:20,710
Do you have a death wish?

773
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:23,440
Do you know how dangerous it is
to drive down the road?

774
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,440
You know about danger?

775
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,360
We almost crashed.

776
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,360
Get on the road!

777
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,280
Why did you get in my way?

778
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:29,800
You did it on purpose.

779
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:31,400
Fine, go ahead!

780
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,360
There are puddles of quicksand
in front of you!

781
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,480
Go ahead.

782
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,110
You can see my car about 12 kilometers

783
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,440
west of town.

784
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:09,480
Help!

785
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,030
Liu, quick!

786
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:21,670
Get here immediately!

787
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,400
Why isn't the excavator moving?

788
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:29,030
The trapped man is in danger.

789
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,920
We have to break the window
and get him out.

790
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,280
Break it! Break it now!

791
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,030
Chen Jianghe,

792
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,230
what happened?

793
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:41,550
What did you do?

794
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:44,110
Speak!

795
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,190
What did you do?

796
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:50,030
He's rescued.

797
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:56,000
Captain Ge!

798
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,800
Captain Ge!

799
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,510
Master.

800
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,550
Master.

801
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,670
Master.

802
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:09,590
Be careful.

803
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,670
Give us a hand.

804
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:13,710
Be careful.
