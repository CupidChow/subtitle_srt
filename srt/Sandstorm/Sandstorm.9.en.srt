Is a boy naughty?

Is it heaven?

17
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,000
Uncle said a princess
would live that high up

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,200
and have a prince come to rescue her.

I'm sorry for your loss.

I know I've been a terrible uncle.

Why are you fighting as a family?

I'm sorry for your loss.

00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:45,590
No. Are you

41
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,710
ignoring my dad's case?

42
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,360
Why do you keep an eye
on me all the time?

43
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,240
Where are you going later?

44
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,080
Are you sick?

45
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,560
What did I do wrong?

00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,720
You had a good permanent job,

50
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,310
why did you quit?

What do you have in mind?

I have no choice.

53
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,270
I've got two kids in school.

54
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,430
I can't afford it.

55
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,040
I'm thinking

56
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,190
of opening a small restaurant

I've been back often,

59
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:48,040
and I've seen
that Wang Liang is quite diligent.

60
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,240
That's true.

If you're looking
for someone to do odd jobs,

there's no one better than him.

63

He's a hard worker, honest,
and he's got nothing to worry about.

64
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,240
Over the years,

65
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,270
he has grown up being fed
by the people of the village.

66
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,600
If you can provide him with meals,

67
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,950
he'll be happier than anyone.

68
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,360

he's been without a home
since he was a kid.

71
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,800
If he'd worked for me,

72
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,720
I'd have paid him

73
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,680
and raised him as my own.

Wang Liang, you're not young anymore.

84

Are you still being fed
by the people of the village?

85

192
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,720
I accept your offer.

193
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,320
I've suffered a great loss.

194
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:40,630
Give me the keys.

195
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,550
Mr. Liu, look.

196
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,790
I've got a 3,000 yuan deposit here.

197
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,240
Please take it.

198
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,390
Don't worry.

199
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,150
I'll give you

200
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,910
the rest of the money later.

201
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,480
Chen,

202
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:06,960
let's do it now.

203
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,720
Okay.

204
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,000
It all needs to be cleaned up here.

205
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,200
Dispose of this.

206
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:19,670
Okay.

207
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:29,550
Let's go.

208
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,720
Mr. Sancheng, is it true
that you're going to close it?

209
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,630
No.

210
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,480
I can't afford any more losses.

211
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,630
Well, what about me?

212
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,320
I told the station about it,

213
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,030
and they told me to go back.

214
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,000
Why don't you...

215
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,750
Mr. Sancheng,

216
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,240
please don't send me away.

217
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:55,790
Get up.

218
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,150
I'm at home here.

219
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,880
I can go and earn money too.

220
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,720
I'll pay for Yingying's
and Fu's studies.

221
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,120
Please don't send me away.

222
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:02,910
Mr. Sancheng,

223
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,510
why are you so loyal?

224
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,200
You're young and strong

225
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,270
and you work hard.

226
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:19,910
How about this?

227
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:20,840
I...

228
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,750
I'll try and talk to the station

229
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,720
and see if they can take you on too.

230
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,080
Thank you, Mr. Sancheng.

231
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:43,720
Master.

232
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,870
Wang Liang.

233
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,390
Not bad, huh?

234
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,910
You look a bit like
a working-class man now.

235
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:57,600
Good.

236
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,030
Wang Liang,

237
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,630
listen here.

238
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:09,910
When I was an apprentice,

239
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,360
I earned 18 yuan a month.

240
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,320
After I finished my apprenticeship,

241
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,440
I got 32.50 yuan

242
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,240
for ten years.

243
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,510
Right now,

244
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,720
you're getting 2,000 yuan a month

245
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,390
as a contract laborer.

246
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,550
You're lucky.

247
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,390
Master,

248
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,670
just leave about 300 yuan

249
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,550
of the 2,000 yuan for me to eat.

250
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:33,440
The rest

251
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,270
is for Yingying's and Fu's schooling.

252
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:38,910
You

253
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,840
have got a conscience.

254
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,510
Stay away.

255
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:42,320
Stay away?

256
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,440
It's like a song.

257
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,840
Stay away.

258
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,030
Not at home. Away.

259
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,910
Holly.

260
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,870
Thank you, Dad.

261
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,120
Dad, you're biased.

262
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,510
You give my brother apples, but not me.

263
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,550
Thank you, Master.

264
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,680
Toast.

265
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,960
Toast.

266
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:31,750
Toast.

267
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,270
Give a toast.

268
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,240
It's not cheers?

269
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,640
Cheers.

270
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,550
Toast, give a toast.

271
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,160
All the best.

272
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,350
Master, let me do it.

273
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,350
You go and rest.

274
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:02,830
It's okay.

275
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:03,440
I can do it.

276
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,440
Master, go and rest.

277
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:06,960
All right.

278
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,110
It's over the house there.

279
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,440
The single-storey house.

280
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,270
Yingying, look.

281
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:46,550
Master,

282
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,200
the station manager is out.

283
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,400
I'll cover for you

284
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,000
before he comes back.

285
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,480
You can sneak home.

286
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,510
It's rare for Fu to come back.

287
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,480
Just spend time with them.

288
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:58,510
No need.

289
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,880
Maybe he's still at the Internet cafe.

290
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,030
Wang Liang,

291
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,480
let's play two rounds.

292
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,400
Again?

293
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:08,720
You lost to me three times yesterday.

294
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,960
That's me letting you win.

295
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,640
Checkmate.

296
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:15,510
Master,

297
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,680
I think someone's stealing the coal.

298
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,440
I'll go out and take a look.

299
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,240
No need. I just took a look.

300
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,440
Nothing. Come on.

301
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,400
Let's play another round.

302
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,920
You've won again this time.

303
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,480
Come on, sit down.

304
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,480
Master,

305
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,270
when are we going back to Luoche?

306
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,830
Madam Gayun makes great yogurt.

307
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,720
She sent me a letter a while back,

308
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,240
saying she'd left a big bucket

309
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,590
for us to pick up.

310
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:54,680
Right,

311
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,640
Madam Gayun's sister
is about to give birth.

312
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,110
What did you say?

313
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,550
You're so chatty.

314
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,590
Wash up

315
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,720
and eat.

316
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,440
Wang Liang and I took over the shift,

317
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,440
filled the furnace with coal

318
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,310
and sat here to play chess.

319
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,400
Nothing happened all night.

320
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,110
Who knew that by the time
the slag came out of the furnace,

321
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,240
it...

322
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,160
Didn't you see anyone come in or out?

323
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,750
We... We keep the gate locked at night.

324
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:00,680
The... The key is
with the station manager.

325
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:03,310
It was about 11 PM

326
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,510
when he came back from outside

327
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,310
and went to bed on the first floor.

328
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,030
The bulbs are fine in the yard.

329
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:08,920
Are they on at night?

330
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,000
It's bright.

331
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,880
Is the door closed at night
when there's no sun?

332
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,440
I closed the door

333
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,270
Where did you sit?

334
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,790
Can't you hear anything at night?

335
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,680
We were focused on our chess game.

336
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,680
Besides, this furnace

337
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,270
makes a lot of noise.

338
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,640
We can't hear anything.

339
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:44,880
I was sitting here.

340
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,310
How many rounds did you play?

341
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,000
Three.

342
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,920
How many rounds did you win?

343
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,110
Three.

344
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,510
You lost three rounds?

345
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,880
You're no good at chess.

346
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,590
All right, thank you
for your cooperation.

347
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,590
Thank you.

348
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,680
Don't worry, Master.

349
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,510
Wang Liang,

350
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:32,480
you've been in town
for six years, right?

351
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,510
Back then, I brought you

352
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,790
back as an errand boy.

353
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,510
Little did I know that we were destined

354
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,000
to become

355
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,240
a family.

356
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,310
Look,

357
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,880
Fu

358
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,960
is my own son.

359
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,070
He's been through school
and his personality has changed.

360
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,270
He's only on holiday
once every six months,

361
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:09,510
and when he comes back, he either
sleeps or goes to the Internet cafe.

362
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:12,400
He seldom speaks to me.

363
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,640
In my heart,

364
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,960
you're my own son.

365
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,880
You're dearer than my own son.

366
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,440
Master,

367
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,590
in my heart,

368
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,590
you're my real dad.

369
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:31,880
Master.

370
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,640
Remember what you said.

371
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,510
Drink slowly.

372
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,350
Dad, I'm back.

373
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,350
Yingying is back.

374
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,160
Wang Liang, you're home.

375
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,400
Yingying, let's eat.

376
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:48,830
Okay.

377
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:49,640
Come on, let me carry them.

378
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:50,640
Thank you.

379
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:53,350
Wang Liang,

380
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,200
just put it in front of my room for me.

381
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,160
I'll sort it out myself later.

382
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:56,920
Okay.

383
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,110
Dad, what's this?

384
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,790
You guys ate first without me?

385
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,510
You have the nerve to say that.

386
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,680
You're on holiday
and you didn't come back quickly.

387
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,160
Fu has been back for a few days.

388
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,110
I was busy at school.

389
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,310
Where is Fu?

390
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,110
He's sleeping. Leave him alone.

391
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,110
Wang Liang, get me a spoon.

392
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:19,880
Okay.

393
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,960
Look at the way you're bossing
Wang Liang around.

394
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,590
Do you really treat him as family?

395
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,720
Why do you keep nagging me
as soon as I get home, Dad?

396
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,750
If you're like this,

397
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,030
I won't come back.

398
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,640
My classmates don't go home on holidays,

399
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,590
they go down south.

400
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,830
Then why did you come back?

401
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:37,030
Don't come back, just stay out there

402
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,110
to have fun with your friends.

403
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:41,110
I'm worried about you.

404
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:43,720
Dad,

405
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,070
I've never seen a real boat
since I was a kid.

406
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,880
Dad, I'd really like to go.

407
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,350
It's too fat. You eat it.

408
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:55,160
Only Wang Liang doesn't dislike you.

409
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,720
What's there to dislike?

410
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,720
Do you dislike me?

411
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,200
No.

412
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,510
As long as you don't dislike me.

413
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:01,830
Look.

414
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,480
Yingying,

415
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,960
I've seen boats.

416
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,110
Where have you seen it?

417
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,200
On TV.

418
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,590
There's everything on TV,

419
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,160
but we have to see it for ourselves.

420
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,400
Let me ask you.

421
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,440
You work and eat,
eat and work every day,

422
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,350
don't you ever get tired of it?

423
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,830
No.

424
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:26,110
I can't get enough
of working with Master.

425
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,310
Poor boy.

426
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,270
Dig in.

427
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,240
Wang Liang.

428
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:33,590
Hurry up and eat.

429
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,240
Go back to the dormitory
as soon as you've finished eating.

430
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,720
Sleep during the day,

431
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,240
you'll be on duty at night.

432
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,510
Okay, Master.

433
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,750
You still have to be on duty at night?

434
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:47,510
I just heard on the bus back

435
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,440
that there was a murder at your station.

436
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,960
What happened?

437
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,000
Eat up.

438
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,070
Why talk about it over dinner?

439
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,160
Is Mr. Liu home?

440
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,640
Wang Liang.

441
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:03,440
Wang Liang is home.

442
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,400
Well, is Mr. Liu home?

443
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:05,960
Yes.

444
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,680
Master.

445
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,160
Mr. Liu.

446
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:07,440
Coming.

447
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:08,790
It's nothing serious.

448
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,070
We're just trying
to find out what's going on.

449
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,480
Show Mr. Liu the photo.

450
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,160
Mr. Liu,

451
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,880
do you know this woman?

452
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,400
I do.

453
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,680
What about you, Wang Liang.

454
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:25,440
Isn't this the one
who sells Malatang at the night market?

455
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,000
Have you seen her lately?

456
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,240
Wang Liang.

457
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,200
Boss.

458
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,480
Caiyun,

459
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,270
have you eaten?

460
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,720
Yes, I have.

461
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,240
Boss...

462
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,000
No, no.

463
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,720
I have eaten.

464
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,750
Since we moved to the town,

465
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,110
you don't come to me anymore,

466
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,550
you're not even close to me.

467
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,720
Have you forgotten

468
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,750
that you used to come to my house

469
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,590
for meals when you were a kid?

470
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,310
I haven't forgotten.

471
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,960
It's that you're different from us now.

472
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,310
How am I different?

473
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,680
Have I grown old?

474
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:15,880
No, no.

475
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,160
You're as beautiful as ever.

476
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:22,400
Wang Liang,

477
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,960
do me a favour.

478
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,880
If it's done, you can have this.

479
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,310
Caiyun,

480
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,400
what is this?

481
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,000
Tell a lie for me.

482
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,160
What lie?

483
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,070
Okay?

484
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:58,830
Caiyun,

485
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,200
I don't think that's a good idea.

486
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,160
Your husband is good to you.

487
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:10,480
I'm good to him, too.

488
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,510
But look at him,

489
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:15,200
he's old and crippled.

490
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,480
He can eat rice anywhere.

491
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,350
Prison food is good, too.

492
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,270
Boss, the bill.

493
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:30,680
I'll pay for you.

494
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:32,270
Boss, the bill.

495
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,030
Wang Liang!

496
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,030
Wang Liang!

497
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,720
I'm helping you, you know?

498
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,440
Caiyun, what do you mean?

499
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,480
What do I mean?

500
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,640
Come here.

501
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,160
How many of you were

502
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,030
at the station the night
of the accident?

503
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,550
Were there three of you?

504
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:15,480
Ding Baoyuan, your master

505
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,640
and you.

506
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:19,110
Who did you think

507
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,680
killed that woman?

508
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,550
Caiyun, who do you think it is?

509
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,550
You.

510
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,750
How... How could it be me?

511
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:32,880
That night, I was playing chess
with my master.

512
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:33,590
And he...

513
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,680
Yes.

514
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,110
You didn't kill her, did you?

515
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,200
Then who did?

516
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,310
Ding Baoyuan killed her.

517
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,000
Just tell me

518
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,110
if you'll help me.

519
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,510
But...

520
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:50,000
But he won't believe me if I say it.

521
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,920
He won't believe it
if someone else says it,

522
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,830
but he'll believe it if you say it.

523
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,030
He knows

524
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,750
I watched you grow up.

525
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,000
Besides,

526
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:01,070
it depends on how you say it.

527
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:03,640
How?

528
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,350
Tell him

529
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,590
that I killed her

530
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,200
and I asked you to bring the body in.

531
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,200
No matter what he asks,

532
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,590
you've got to insist

533
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,110
that I killed her,

534
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,400
got it?

535
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,000
Is it a good idea?

536
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,510
Why not?

537
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:23,200
All right.

538
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,830
I'll leave it to you.

539
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,110
I'm counting on you.

540
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,480
Thank you for your cooperation,
Manager Ding.

541
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:38,680
That's what I should do.

542
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,680
Go back. Just see us off here.

543
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:52,070
Manager Ding,

544
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:53,750
can we keep the furnace burning?

545
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:54,920
We'll wait for notice.

546
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,790
Well, we...

547
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,270
Get back to work.

548
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:58,270
Wang Liang,

549
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,790
come here.

550
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,000
Manager Ding, what's the matter?

551
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,400
Close the door.

552
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:25,790
Wang Liang,

553
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,750
is it true what my wife said?

554
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,680
What did Caiyun say?

555
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,640
I'm asking you.

556
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,640
How did you get her in here?

557
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,110
I didn't get anyone in.

558
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:45,640
I...

559
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,310
How could I have gotten someone in here?

560
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,110
I...

561
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:50,510
Caiyun called me

562
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:51,720
and asked me
to leave the gate open for her.

563
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,790
After leaving the gate open,

564
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,110
I went to play chess.

565
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,680
You left the gate open?

566
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,510
How did you leave the gate open for her?

567
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,070
I usually carry some coal back
with my master

568
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:07,270
so I've got an extra key.

569
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,160
I'm sorry.

570
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,160
Keep your mouth shut.

571
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:36,790
Get out.

572
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:52,960
Eat slowly.

573
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,750
Yingying is still cooking some dishes.

574
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,550
I will

575
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,030
pack my things later

576
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,510
and go back to school today.

577
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,310
No.

578
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,240
You've only been back for a few days,

579
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,400
you're leaving now?

580
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:10,510
I'm full.

581
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,270
All right.

582
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,000
I'll go get you some more money.

583
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,400
Wang Liang, you're back.

584
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:45,960
Madam Zhang.

585
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,550
Master, I've come to return the book.

586
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:52,030
Wang Liang.

587
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,110
Is Yingying home?

588
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,240
Yingying,

589
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,110
Where should I put it?

590
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,550
Put it on the fridge for me.

591
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,920
Why do you keep coming
to our house lately?

592
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,000
My dad even said

593
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,440
you're like his real son.

594
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,200
What?

595
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,070
Do you want to be his son?

596
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,400
It'd be nice to be Master's son,

597
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,360
so I can see you every day.

598
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,630
You've been a little out of line
with your words lately.

599
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:21,190
Let me help you, Yingying.

600
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:22,030
Yingying,

601
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:23,400
stop doing it.

602
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:26,880
Fu said he's going back to school today.

603
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:28,550
Help him pack his things

604
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,280
and take him to the bus station later.

605
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,030
In such a hurry?

606
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,840
He said there's something going on
at school.

607
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,480
Okay.

608
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,280
I'll help him pack his things.

609
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,070
He can't do it himself.

610
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:38,480
Yingying, let me help you.

611
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:40,710
Why are you following her?

612
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,030
I'm going to help Fu and Yingying

613
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:43,710
pack up.

614
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,590
No need.

615
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,190
Packing things

616
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,920
is a woman's job.

617
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,000
Liu, Liu!

618
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,230
Something big has happened.

619
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,030
Our station manager has run away!

620
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:54,840
Our station manager has run away?

621
00:34:58,650 --> 00:34:59,440
What's going on?

622
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,550
Baoyuan has run away?

623
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,280
Yes.

624
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:02,070
Really?

625
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,920
He's the one
who committed the murder at our station.

626
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:05,960
Really?

627
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,440
Yes.

628
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,280
The police are looking
for him all over town.

629
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,320
Yingying,

630
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:17,400
Wang Liang,

631
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,070
you two go out first.

632
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:23,030
I... I'll talk to Fu.

633
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:24,840
Okay.

634
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,030
Sit down.

635
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,510
The police have gone
to arrest Ding Baoyuan.

636
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,550
The word on the street is

637
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,710
that Ding Baoyuan killed that woman.

638
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,030
I didn't want you to leave

639
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,840
because I was afraid people
would suspect you.

640
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:06,510
But it's all right.

641
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,440
It's fine for now.

642
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,510
Just leave.

643
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:35,840
After you leave,

644
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,070
don't come back again.

Ying...

728
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,510
This boy, Wang Liang,

729
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,550
He was only this tall

730
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,670
when I met him.

731
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,190
He's grown up.

732
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,230
Then,

733
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:40,110
when he got a bit older

734
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:43,070
and I took him out of Luoche.

735
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,590
First he worked as an errand boy

736
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:46,880
in my small restaurant.

737
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:48,550
After that,

738
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:50,710
he joined the station as my apprentice.

739
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:51,630
Yes.

740
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,150
Six years have passed since then.

741
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:57,280
I've watched him grow up.

742
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,190
We're destined to meet.

743
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,760
Over the years,

744
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,590
we've become

745
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,670
like a family.

746
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:08,630
So, I've decided

747
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:12,880
that from today onward,

748
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:16,360
I'll officially take Wang Liang
as my godson.

749
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:17,550
I promise

750
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,360
to treat him like my own son
from now on.

751
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,000
I'll finish this.

00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,360

00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:23,800

00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:29,440
Cheers.

758
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:31,110
Mr. Liu.

759
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,440
Welcome.

760
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,070
Thanks for coming.

761
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:35,760
Congratulations.

762
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,550
These are some normal dishes.
Please don't mind and eat more.

763
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:38,840
It's not bad.

764
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,190
Come on, Wang Liang.

765
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,670
Come on.

766
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,000
Congratulations.

767
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,400
Thank you.

768
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,030
Come on, eat more.

769
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:50,840
Just some normal dishes.

770
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,960
Thank you.

771
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,400
Just see us off here.

772
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:56,880
Thank you.

773
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,670
We're off to work.

774
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:58,960
Come over for dinner sometime.

775
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,230
Everyone's gone.

776
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,630
Let me drink with you.

777
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,190
Master.

778
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,320
Why are you still calling me Master?

779
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,670
You'll have to call me Dad from now on.

780
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,030
Master, you knew

781
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,510
that I like Yingying,

782
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:59,230
but you took me as your godson

783
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,230
in front of so many people?

784
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:04,670
You've always said

785
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:07,480
you think of me as your own dad.

786
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,320
I also want to recognize you as my son.

787
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:11,630
Well...

788
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:14,110
What does this have to do with Yingying?

789
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:14,880
Come on.

790
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:24,590
You know that's not what I want.

791
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:28,030
I know.

792
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,840
I know what you want.

793
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:33,440
Come on, look.

794
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:35,670
This one.

795
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,760
She works in a state-run organization

796
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,960
as an accountant.

797
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:42,510
And this.

798
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,800
She's from Luoche, too.

799
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:49,360
She'll get along with you.

800
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,800
She's the prettiest.

801
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:54,230
But

802
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,070
she works in a massage parlor.

803
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,070
Anyway,

804
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,630
any job will do,

805
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,590
as long as it makes money.

806
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,400
Do you like her?

807
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:09,070
All right.

808
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,190
I'm going to the matchmaker.

809
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,190
She's not even as good as one
of Yingying's toes.

810
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:27,760
Yingying won't graduate
for another year.

811
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,800
What if she graduates

812
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:32,150
and finds a job out there,

813
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:34,150
what if she doesn't come back
for a few years?

814
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:37,190
I can wait for 10 years,

815
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:38,800
I'll wait for Yingying.

816
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:44,070
What if she

817
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,480
never comes back?

818
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:54,710
Master,

819
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,150
I'm going back to rest.

820
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:09,230
Go.

821
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:12,840
Go.

822
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:16,760
My son,

823
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,190
come on.

824
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:19,800
Eat slowly.

825
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:22,760
It's all your favourite dishes.

826
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:28,360
Master, I'm full.

827
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:32,400
Wang Liang.

828
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:36,400
I've asked Yingying.

829
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,150
She said

830
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,590
she wants to stay in the province

831
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:42,480
after graduation.

832
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:45,760
Look,

833
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,630
my children have all grown up.

834
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,150
They want to go far.

835
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,400
Of course Fu wants
to run as far away as possible.

836
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:58,110
But Yingying won't come back either?

837
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:09,840
Happy birthday to you.

838
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:14,110
Happy birthday to you.

839
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:14,760
Make a wish.

840
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:15,800
Make a wish.

841
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,150
Okay.

842
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:27,960
Mom, turn the light on.

843
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:28,590
Okay.

844
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,000
I'll cut the cake.

845
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:34,590
Go ahead.

846
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:36,030
Mom,

847
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:37,150
take a picture of the two of us.

848
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:38,590
Smile.

849
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:50,360
Yingying,

850
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:52,320
my parents like you very much.

851
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,630
When you graduate, let's get married.

852
00:46:58,590 --> 00:46:59,880
Are you proposing to me?

853
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:03,920
I'll say no.

854
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:04,670
Why?

855
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:07,030
Who proposes like that?

856
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:10,030
Wait a minute.

857
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:13,440
Hi.

858
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,360
Hello, Mister.
Do you want to buy flowers?

859
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:16,510
Yes.

860
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:17,630
What do you think about this?

861
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:18,440
Hello, Dad.

862
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:19,190
I'll take one.

863
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:20,150
Okay.

864
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:22,710
What's the matter?

865
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,510
You're sick?

866
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:29,440
Okay, I got it.

867
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:30,710
I'll go back first thing
in the morning.

868
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:32,150
Okay.

869
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:35,190
I'll take this.

870
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:37,000
Okay, thank you.

871
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:46,110
What are you doing?

872
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:47,880
There are many people here. Get up.

873
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:51,230
Yingying, marry me.

874
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:55,840
I know. Get up.

875
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,880
Yingying, let me carry this.

876
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,960
How's my dad? What's wrong with him?

877
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,070
He's fine.

878
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:11,150
He's fine?

879
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:12,510
What do you mean?

880
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:14,280
I thought he said he was sick.

881
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,230
You'll know when you're home.

882
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:20,920
I'll take this.

883
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,110
Let's go. Get on the bike.

884
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:39,630
Yingying, you go inside first.

885
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:40,880
Master is waiting for you inside.

886
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:42,360
Aren't you coming in?

887
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,960
No, I have to go to work.

888
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:45,800
Come over for dinner when you're free.

889
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:49,630
Dad!

890
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:53,710
Dad.

891
00:48:57,230 --> 00:48:57,960
Yingying.

892
00:48:58,110 --> 00:48:59,230
Where do you feel sick?

893
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,110
I...

894
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:03,550
I've been feeling

895
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:05,760
a bit sick inside for a while now.

896
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,840
I feel better now that you're back.

897
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:14,510
Dad,

898
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,510
I didn't come back on holiday

899
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:19,710
because I wanted to make more money
in the province.

900
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:23,710
It's nice in the province,
with all the buildings,

901
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,230
unlike here,
where there's sand everywhere.

902
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,480
I want to make more money

903
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:29,880
and take you with me.

904
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,550
Yingying, you're not young anymore.

905
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:34,550
It's time for you to get married.

906
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:37,230
Marry Wang Liang.

907
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:40,710
Dad, what are you talking about?

908
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:43,760
Marry Wang Liang.

909
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:46,000
I promised Wang Liang.

910
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:48,960
Why should I marry Wang Liang?

911
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:50,800
What are you talking about?

912
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:54,030
Dad, I'll be honest with you,

913
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,030
I have a boyfriend.

914
00:49:56,590 --> 00:49:58,710
And their family promised
to find me a job

915
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,840
in the province after I graduate.

916
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,710
When I'm stable and make money,

917
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,960
I'll take you to the province
to enjoy your life.

918
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:06,710
Okay?

919
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:07,480
No way!

920
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:10,880
I don't care.

921
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:13,150
You must marry Wang Liang.

922
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:16,280
What's wrong?

923
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:17,630
What's happened?

924
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,110
Why do you want me to marry Wang Liang?

925
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,590
You're going to marry anyway.

926
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:24,070
It doesn't matter who you marry.

927
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,510
I decide

928
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:27,880
who I marry.

929
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,190
Don't worry about it.

930
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:32,030
You're not sick.

931
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:33,190
Then I'm going back to school.

932
00:50:34,710 --> 00:50:35,480
Yingying!

933
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:36,760
What?

934
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:41,630
I have no choice.

935
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:45,190
Please say yes.

936
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:47,960
Dad, what's wrong with you today?

937
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:50,280
What the hell is going on?

938
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,800
Why don't you have a choice?

939
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,800
If I marry Wang Liang, it'll help?

940
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:03,440
I can't tell you anything about this.

941
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:06,190
I beg you.

942
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:07,880
Dad, don't beg me.

943
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,030
I can't marry him!

944
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:11,760
You won't tell me the reason, huh?

945
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:15,550
If you won't tell me,

946
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:17,400
I'm leaving.

947
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:18,630
I won't marry him!

948
00:51:18,670 --> 00:51:19,590
I won't ever marry him!

949
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:20,230
Yingying!

950
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,320
You can't leave!

951
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:22,710
You can't leave!

952
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:23,670
Don't be like this, Dad!

953
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:24,230
You can't leave!

954
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:26,840
Dad!

955
00:51:27,590 --> 00:51:29,630
Dad!

956
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:33,670
Dad!

957
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:36,320
Dad, what's happened?

958
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,150
Dad, what's wrong?

959
00:51:39,150 --> 00:51:40,760
What's going on?

960
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:42,840
Dad, you're scaring me!

961
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,630
Dad!

962
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,280
Dad, let me out of here! Tell me

963
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,760
what's going on!

964
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:51,230
Dad!

965
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,550
Dad!

966
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,150
Dad!

967
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,110
Let me out of here!

968
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,320
It's been two days.

969
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:17,960
You must eat something.

970
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:21,590
Eat up.

971
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:41,280
Whether you eat or not,

972
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,280
you have to marry Wang Liang.

973
00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:46,870
- I don't want!
- Do you have a death wish?

974
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:49,110
Do you have a death wish?

975
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:50,320
Do you have a death wish?

976
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,150
Beat me up.

977
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:54,550
Beat me up!

978
00:52:55,230 --> 00:52:56,280
Beat me to death!

979
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,150
I won't marry Wang Liang
even if I'm dead!

980
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:07,230
I'm a beast.

981
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:07,670
Dad, don't beat yourself.

982
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:08,230
I'm a beast.

983
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:08,630
Dad!

984
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,030
- Dad.
- I'm a beast.

985
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:12,150
I've done a beastly thing!

986
00:53:13,510 --> 00:53:15,150
What's happened?

987
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:18,960
Dad, what the hell is going on?

988
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,070
Why have you suddenly become like this?

989
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:22,590
Your brother killed someone.

990
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,760
I helped him

991
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,670
stuff the body in the furnace.

992
00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:55,230
The Cheng Chun

993
00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:58,320
who died last year?

994
00:53:59,230 --> 00:53:59,670
Yes.

995
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:00,360
Well,

996
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,230
didn't Ding Baoyuan kill her?

997
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,190
Actually, it was your brother.

998
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:12,400
And I was involved.

999
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:17,400
Dad,

1000
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,110
Ding Baoyuan...

1001
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:20,840
Ding Baoyuan was convicted.

1002
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,760
Isn't this over?

1003
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:25,960
It's not over.

1004
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:27,760
Wang Liang

1005
00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:31,590
saw it.

1006
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,230
If you don't say yes,

1007
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,670
if Wang Liang tells anyone about this,

1008
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,670
our family will be doomed.

1009
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:43,280
Yingying,

1010
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,230
I beg you.

1011
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,360
I beg you.

1012
00:54:58,550 --> 00:55:00,280
If this gets out,

1013
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,760
I'll be sentenced,

1014
00:55:04,070 --> 00:55:05,400
your brother will be executed,

1015
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,630
and the Liu family
will cease to have any descendants.

1016
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:08,920
You...

1017
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,190
You'll be called

1018
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,840
a murderer's family, too.

1019
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:15,030
You're going to be criticized.

1020
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:17,920
For the sake of your brother,

1021
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:19,400
for the sake of our family,

1022
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,320
please marry Wang Liang.

1023
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:23,920
I beg you.

1024
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:39,960
One, two, three, smile.

1025
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,110
What are you doing?

1026
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:44,110
There are many people here. Get up.

1027
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:48,760
Yingying, marry me.

1028
00:55:51,070 --> 00:55:52,400
Yingying hasn't graduated yet.

1029
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:58,320
Let's just keep it simple

1030
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,550
at home.

1031
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:04,550
Serve me the tea.

1032
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:10,710
Dad, please have some tea.

1033
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:20,190
Yingying.

1034
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:23,760
Yingying.

1035
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:25,510
Dad.

1036
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,000
I'll serve you tea
on behalf of Yingying.

1037
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:33,480
From now on.

1038
00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:36,280
we're really family.

1039
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:39,030
You have to take care

1040
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,110
of everything at home.

1041
00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:47,320
That's it.

1042
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:03,840
Yingying,

1043
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,360
I'll be good to you
for the rest of my life.

1044
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:08,280
Let's live a good life.

1045
00:57:12,590 --> 00:57:13,110
Yingying.

1046
00:57:13,110 --> 00:57:14,150
Don't touch me!

1047
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:18,670
Let go of me!

1048
00:57:48,110 --> 00:57:49,230
It's hard on you.

1049
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:03,880
Yingying,

1050
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:08,110
that's what people do.

1051
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:14,800
You just make do with what you've got
and that's it.

1052
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:18,510
I was only in my 30s

1053
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,000
when your mum left.

1054
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:26,030
Now,

1055
00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:30,070
I'm already so old.

1056
00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:39,510
I'll ask him to cook you something.

1057
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:27,070
Yingying, eat something.

1058
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:29,190
You haven't eaten for three days.

1059
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:44,110
Can I ask you for one thing?

1060
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:49,480
Ying Ying, not just one thing,

1061
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:50,510
as long as I can do it,

1062
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:52,320
I'll promise you a thousand
or ten thousand things.

1063
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,710
Can I go back to finish my studies?

1064
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:00,760
I have one more semester to graduate.

1065
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:12,920
Can I?

1066
01:00:18,970 --> 01:00:20,400
Will you come back again?

1067
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:21,960
Sure.

1068
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:23,840
I will.

1069
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:31,400
Okay.

1070
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:34,590
I grant you that.

1071
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:38,230
Thank you.

1072
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:45,150
Eat something,

1073
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:46,920
okay?

1074
01:00:58,510 --> 01:00:59,150
Yingying.

1075
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:15,960
You don't answer my calls

1076
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:17,550
or reply to my messages these days.

1077
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:19,550
I...

1078
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,800
I've got a lot of things to do
since I'm graduating.

1079
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:23,150
I'm busy.

1080
01:01:24,110 --> 01:01:25,630
Are you hiding something from me?

1081
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:26,840
No.

1082
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:28,840
No, really. You're imagining things.

1083
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:32,280
Did I do something

1084
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:33,190
to piss you off?

1085
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,360
- Or...
- No.

1086
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:40,630
Nothing.

1087
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:44,360
I know you're busy.

1088
01:01:45,030 --> 01:01:46,550
But don't keep not replying
to my messages.

1089
01:01:46,550 --> 01:01:47,960
I'll be worried, you know?

1090
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:51,630
Have you eaten?

1091
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:54,920
No.

1092
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:58,110
Why don't you take me out
for some good food?

1093
01:01:58,760 --> 01:01:59,400
Let's go.

1094
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:04,440
By the way,

1095
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:05,400
Jiang,

1096
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:07,670
have you found a job for Yingying yet?

1097
01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:08,760
Don't worry.

1098
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,360
As soon as Yingying graduates,

1099
01:02:10,630 --> 01:02:12,070
I'll arrange it for her.

1100
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:12,800
Uncle,

1101
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,320
I told Jiang Chao

1102
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,230
I want

1103
01:02:15,230 --> 01:02:17,630
to apply for jobs on my own
after graduation.

1104
01:02:17,630 --> 01:02:19,110
I don't want to bother you.

1105
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:20,030
While your uncle

1106
01:02:20,030 --> 01:02:21,440
is still able to help you,

1107
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,230
he should help you more.

1108
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:24,360
We're all family.

1109
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,360
Spare the courtesy.

1110
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,360
Mum, Yingying's grades are pretty good.

1111
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:28,760
You really don't need
to worry about that.

1112
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:29,800
Here.

1113
01:02:30,550 --> 01:02:32,070
Come on, Yingying, let's eat.

1114
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:37,230
What's wrong with here?

1115
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:38,840
Jiang Chao, go and take a look.

1116
01:02:41,150 --> 01:02:42,190
Yingying, are you all right?

1117
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:43,280
I'm fine.

1118
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:44,920
Did you eat something bad?

1119
01:02:45,070 --> 01:02:45,960
Go and take a look.

1120
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:47,030
Okay.

1121
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:50,480
Jiang Chao,

1122
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:52,550
Why don't you take Yingying
to the hospital

1123
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:54,550
to see if she's eaten something bad?

1124
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:56,670
Aunt, I'm really fine.

1125
01:02:56,670 --> 01:02:58,000
I can hold it in.

1126
01:02:58,150 --> 01:02:59,360
How can it be held in?

1127
01:02:59,670 --> 01:03:01,070
It's better to go to the hospital.

1128
01:03:01,150 --> 01:03:02,030
We'll be relieved

1129
01:03:02,030 --> 01:03:03,230
if you're all right.

1130
01:03:03,230 --> 01:03:04,920
Yes, Jiang Chao. Go.

1131
01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:05,800
Okay.

1132
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:07,110
Honey, go with them.

1133
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,440
Drive the kids there.

1134
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:10,230
Okay.

1135
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:13,230
Be careful on the way.

1136
01:03:13,230 --> 01:03:13,920
Okay.

1137
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,840
Jiang, where's the car key?

1138
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:22,510
Car key?

1139
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:24,190
Let me look for it.

1140
01:03:24,510 --> 01:03:25,760
Car key. Let me look for it.

1141
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:28,150
Here you go.

1142
01:03:29,230 --> 01:03:30,400
Why did you put it there?

1143
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,550
From the check-ups,

1144
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:39,550
it looks like
pregnancy-induced vomiting.

1145
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:42,320
That's impossible, Doctor.
Is the result wrong?

1146
01:03:43,150 --> 01:03:44,760
Blood and urine tests are here.

1147
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:46,150
Progesterone's already high.

1148
01:03:46,150 --> 01:03:47,320
It can't be wrong.

1149
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:48,960
How about this?

1150
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,550
I'll transfer you to the gynecology
and obstetrics department.

1151
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:51,760
After that,

1152
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:53,800
you must come for regular check-ups.

1153
01:03:58,230 --> 01:03:59,150
Go pay the bill.

1154
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:04,630
Go pay the bill.

1155
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:06,280
Doctor,

1156
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:08,360
she's my son's classmate.

1157
01:04:08,590 --> 01:04:09,880
She's not feeling well today.

1158
01:04:10,150 --> 01:04:11,800
So we brought her to the hospital.

1159
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:13,630
Liu Yingying,

1160
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:14,960
you should

1161
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:16,880
make up your own mind
about this kind of thing.

1162
01:04:24,230 --> 01:04:25,710
Are you blind?

1163
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:27,550
What girl did you bring home?

1164
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:29,000
You think she's good.

1165
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:29,920
I wonder

1166
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:31,480
what she's been doing behind your back.

1167
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:55,230
Bed 24, it's time to breastfeed.

1168
01:04:57,030 --> 01:04:59,030
There's no milk. I'm not feeding.

1169
01:04:59,630 --> 01:05:00,960
You can feed her cow's milk.

1170
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:05,110
I saw your chest wet

1171
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:06,760
when I washed your clothes yesterday.

1172
01:05:07,510 --> 01:05:08,760
Who told you to touch my clothes?

1173
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:12,150
It's better for the baby
to be breastfed.

1174
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:13,400
Besides,

1175
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:15,280
if you have breast milk and don't feed,

1176
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:16,920
it's not good for you either.

1177
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:18,230
I said I'm not feeding.

1178
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:23,400
Please feed her cow's milk.

1179
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:27,480
Let's go, poor baby.

1180
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:29,280
Let's get some cow's milk.

1181
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,190
Did you call my grandma?

1182
01:05:36,190 --> 01:05:37,000
Yes.

1183
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:38,550
Your grandma told you

1184
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:40,440
to think it over.

1185
01:05:41,590 --> 01:05:42,550
I've thought about it.

1186
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:44,000
Send her away tomorrow.

1187
01:05:44,070 --> 01:05:44,840
I have to work.

1188
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:48,190
What?

1189
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:51,360
Yingying said

1190
01:05:51,710 --> 01:05:54,150
to send the baby
for her grandma to raise.

1191
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:58,960
Yingying, you...

1192
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:00,440
What do you mean by doing this?

1193
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:02,920
She's our daughter.

1194
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,110
I've made up my mind.

1195
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:09,550
Yingying.

1196
01:06:10,190 --> 01:06:10,800
Don't touch me!

1197
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:17,070
We already have a daughter.

1198
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:18,760
Let's just live a good life together,
okay?

1199
01:06:19,630 --> 01:06:21,360
And the baby was born
without drinking a sip of milk.

1200
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:22,510
- You...
- I've said it all.

1201
01:06:25,670 --> 01:06:26,880
Can't you understand?

1202
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:19,320
Be careful, don't hurt yourself.

1203
01:07:19,710 --> 01:07:20,670
Here, keep it warm.

1204
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:23,360
Call me when it's almost done.

1205
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:30,960
Yingying.

1206
01:07:31,230 --> 01:07:31,760
Head nurse.

1207
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:32,880
Why are you back at work so early?

1208
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:34,710
You have six months of maternity leave.

1209
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:36,190
It's only been a month.

1210
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:38,960
I'm free anyway.

1211
01:07:39,630 --> 01:07:41,840
I heard you sent your baby back
to your hometown.

1212
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:43,670
How could you bear to do that?

1213
01:07:45,630 --> 01:07:46,920
Her grandma adores her.

1214
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,360
You have to bring up the child yourself,

1215
01:07:49,550 --> 01:07:51,480
or she'll grow up
to be distant from you.

1216
01:08:16,450 --> 01:08:18,780
[2011]

1217
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:19,640
I'm at work.

1218
01:08:20,470 --> 01:08:21,560
- Yingying.
- Manager Wang.

1219
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:22,190
Yingying.

1220
01:08:22,270 --> 01:08:24,430
Grandma called out of the blue
and said Duoduo's sick.

1221
01:08:25,070 --> 01:08:26,310
Let's bring her here for a check-up.

1222
01:08:27,150 --> 01:08:28,270
Did she say what the illness was?

1223
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:31,110
The clinic there said

1224
01:08:31,470 --> 01:08:32,840
it might be leukemia.

1225
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:36,720
What?

1226
01:08:38,190 --> 01:08:38,880
Leukemia.

1227
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:49,560
Duoduo,

1228
01:08:50,030 --> 01:08:50,640
look.

1229
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:52,800
Your uncle is here.

1230
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:54,350
Your uncle is here.

1231
01:08:55,190 --> 01:08:56,430
Don't run.

1232
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:58,800
Uncle.

1233
01:09:00,390 --> 01:09:01,070
Duoduo.

1234
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:03,600
Duoduo.

1235
01:09:04,350 --> 01:09:04,920
Come here.

1236
01:09:05,110 --> 01:09:06,390
Uncle.

1237
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:09,310
Duoduo.

1238
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:10,960
Look who's here.

1239
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:16,070
Come on, that's your mom.

1240
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:18,520
Call her Mom.

1241
01:09:30,350 --> 01:09:32,430
Wang Liang, let's go inside.

1242
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:36,310
Duoduo.

1243
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:38,470
Stay here and play with Mom
for a while, okay?

1244
01:09:39,190 --> 01:09:39,560
Good girl.

1245
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:40,310
Grandma.

1246
01:10:14,150 --> 01:10:14,880
Duoduo.

1247
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:18,560
I'm your mom.

1248
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:23,470
