[Sandstorm]
[Episode 6]

4
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,870
In the ninth year of Yonghe,
during the year of Guichou,

5
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,680
in the early spring,

6
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:07,120
we gathered at the Lan Pavilion
in Shanyin, Kuaiji County,

7
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,960
for a purification ritual.

8
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,750
Many wise men attended...

9
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,910
Are you indicating Yingying and Dafu?

10
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,120
Of course, I remember.

11
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,800
Back then,

12
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,150
I was in charge of Yingying's class.

13
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,520
As for Fu, he was in the
experimental class for our grade.

14
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,470
These two kids came from poor families.

15
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,240
They were two years older
than the other classmates.

16
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,280
They were the eldest in the class.

17
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,590
Both of them

18
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,820
had excellent grades.

19
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,190
They obtained the highest scores in the
National College Entrance Examination.

20
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,940
Do you remember
which colleges they attended?

21
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:44,590
Fu should've attended
to the Provincial University.

22
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,590
For Yingying, it's a pity.

23
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:50,340
Her exam score wasn't
any worse than her brother's.

24
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,620
She should've attended
to the Provincial Medical University.

25
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,380
Her first choice was
the Provincial Medical University, too.

26
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,430
But, unfortunately,

27
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:01,470
she ended up attending to
a college in the provincial capital.

28
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,750
Why a college instead
of the medical university?

29
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,660
Their family couldn't afford
to send both to the university.

30
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,190
They had to sacrifice Yingying.

31
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,030
That year, she was the student
with the highest score

32
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,750
who was admitted to that college.

33
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,950
The college was thrilled

34
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,180
to have such an outstanding student,

35
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,420
waiving all her tuition fee

36
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,590
and giving her
a huge amount of scholarship.

37
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,150
The class is over.

38
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:26,950
The class is over.

39
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:33,950
What a shame!

40
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,420
Everyone feels the same.

41
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,740
I even had a special talk
with her back then.

42
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,780
You shouldn't slack off in the college.

43
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,590
Thank you, Teacher Guo.

44
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,830
Goodbye, Teacher Guo.

45
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:49,830
Alright, you may leave.

46
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,980
Teacher Guo.

47
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,780
Liu Yingying, have you
made up your mind?

48
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,180
Do you really want
to change your option?

49
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,220
You could have gone
to the Medical University.

50
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,220
Why do you choose to attend a college?

51
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,740
After graduating
from the Medical University,

52
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,390
you could attend the
postgraduate entrance examination,

53
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,070
or directly work at a hospital.

54
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,320
You could become a doctor
after a few years of internship.

55
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,340
Isn't that good?

56
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,590
I've made up my mind.
I want to go to the college.

57
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,390
You're the only one in our class
who got into the Medical University.

58
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,390
You can't just give up at this point.

59
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,180
Teacher Guo,

60
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,780
our family has two college students
out of a sudden.

61
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,220
My dad can't afford it.

62
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,660
But, your dad shouldn't sacrifice you
because of that.

63
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,980
Moreover, if you have any difficulties,

64
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,740
you could apply for a student loan.

65
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,660
I've thought about it.

66
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,040
But, attending Medical University

67
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,590
will take five years

68
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,270
and after graduation,

69
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,630
if I want to stay
in the provincial hospital,

70
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,950
I'll need to go to graduate school.

71
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,630
It will take seven or eight years.

72
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,270
But if I attend to a college,

73
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,030
I can graduate in three years

74
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,340
and started earning money right away.

75
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,950
Your father is so short-sighted.

76
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,830
He just wants you to earn money sooner,

77
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,280
sacrificing your bright future.

78
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,480
Liu Yingying,

79
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,360
you can't do this.

80
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,680
If you do that,
you will regret it in the future.

81
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,280
Otherwise...

82
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,210
Teacher, I've made up my mind.

83
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,410
I'm going to the college.
I will not change anymore.

84
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,680
I couldn't bear to give up on her.

85
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,480
I even thought
about talking to her father.

86
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,770
I visited them twice,

87
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,890
but they wouldn't open the door for me.

88
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,360
Then, I gave up on it.

89
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,720
The last time I saw her

90
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,280
was at the bus station.

91
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:27,680
[Boarding Area]

92
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,450
Yingying.

93
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,330
Teacher Guo.

94
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,530
Liu Yingying.

95
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,280
Teacher Guo.

96
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,410
Why are you here?

97
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,410
I'm sending my nephew off.

98
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:55,720
He's heading for the enrollment.

99
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,570
Are you going to the enrollment too?

100
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,650
Teacher Guo,

101
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,600
thank you for all your guidance
over the past three years.

102
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,480
You're in a good mood now.

103
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,530
Just forget about the moment
you cried badly

104
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:06,570
when your father asked you
to change your college option.

105
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:09,920
I've figured it out.

106
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,480
Crying is useless at all.

107
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,920
Attending college is also a good option.

108
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,280
After graduation, I can still pursue a bachelor's degree
and take the postgraduate entrance examination.

109
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,920
As long as I work harder,
it will be fine.

110
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:18,570
Once I leave here,

111
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,120
my father won't be able
to control me anymore.

112
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,280
It's been tough for you, kid.

113
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,800
Remember your words, work hard.

114
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,600
The bus to Jingchuan is boarding.

115
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,480
I get to go now.

116
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,360
Go ahead.

117
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,810
Go ahead.

118
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,930
I'm leaving, Yingying.

119
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,090
Safe journey.

120
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,400
Go back home.

121
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,000
Of course, I remember Liu Yingying.

122
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,880
She was a notable star at our school.

123
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,120
Why do you say so?

124
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,090
Her college entrance exam score

125
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:31,360
is still unbeaten at our school.

126
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,760
Oh, how impressive she is!

127
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,090
She had the score for a top-tier
university, but ended up at our college,

128
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,330
she would definitely
be the most impressive one.

129
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,330
She wasn't just good at studying
and ambitious,

130
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,760
she was also very pretty.

131
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:44,520
Oh yeah,

132
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,000
she served as the student council
president for three consecutive terms.

133
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,120
She's very awesome.

134
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,930
Three, two, one.

135
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,450
Three, two, one. Keep going!

136
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:53,970
Keep going!

137
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,360
Later, she started dating a guy.

138
00:09:58,690 --> 00:09:59,810
His academic performance was average.

139
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:02,360
But, since his parents
were government officials

140
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,360
in the province,

141
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,450
his family arranged for Liu Yingying

142
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,600
to work at the
provincial public hospital.

143
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,400
Once they graduated,

144
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,120
they could settle down
in the province together.

145
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,000
That sounds like a good match.

146
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,330
Why did they break up?

147
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,600
I'm not very sure

148
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,330
about the details.

149
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:36,760
It seems like it happened
early in their last semester.

150
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,330
Just a few days after school reopened,

151
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,810
we heard they had broken up.

152
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:44,520
At that time,

153
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:48,570
there were some rumors circulating

154
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:51,400
about Liu Yingying among her peers.

155
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,520
Some said she wasn't self-respecting,

156
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,690
and others said she was involved with
more than one guy at the same time.

157
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,400
There were all kinds of stories.

158
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:02,170
But honestly,

159
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,360
even without that boy's help,

160
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,600
Liu Yingying could also
stay in the province

161
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,600
because her academic performance

162
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,690
was always the best in the whole school.

163
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,090
Yet, the rumors

164
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,690
had quite an impact on her.

165
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,600
She wasn't herself.

166
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,930
Once Liu Yingying graduated,

167
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,520
she went back to Kulu.

168
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,970
I still couldn't understand

169
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,520
her decision to this day.

170
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:32,720
I couldn't understand either.

171
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,720
Didn't her teachers try
to reach out to her?

172
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,930
I did talk to her.

173
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,360
But she said

174
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:44,210
her brother had already found a job
out of the county,

175
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,970
and her family needed someone
to take care of them.

176
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,880
But, I can understand

177
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,520
her reasoning.

178
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,970
The demand for healthcare workers
in the rural areas was also a reality.

179
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,290
Here's your coffee.

180
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,290
Welcome, how many people do you have?

181
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,090
Are you Jiang Chao?

182
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,760
I'm Chen Jianghe, from Kulu.

183
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,720
Officer Chen, nice to meet you.

184
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,520
Nice to meet you.

185
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,570
Please have a seat.

186
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,570
Here's my police ID.

187
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,290
Officer Chen, would you like
to have a drink?

188
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,930
Anything is fine.

189
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,930
I'll order according to my taste then.

190
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,930
Sure.

191
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:36,360
Waiter.

192
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:37,880
Two Americanos, please.

193
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,600
Alright, coming right up.

194
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,720
Could I get some milk in one?

195
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:42,880
Sure, one with milk.

196
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,520
Alright.

197
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,720
Add some sugar
to the one with milk, please.

198
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,930
You mentioned over the phone
that you had something to ask me?

199
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,360
Yes, I did.

200
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,600
I just wanted to ask you

201
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,880
about some things back
in your college years.

202
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,480
Was Liu Yingying your classmate?

203
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,210
We were at the same school,

204
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:04,330
but not the same year.

205
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,600
Did you two date?

206
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,720
Yes, we did.

207
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:12,930
Do you both still keep in touch?

208
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:15,210
Since she went back to Kulu,

209
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:16,480
we haven't been in contact.

210
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:18,880
She never tried to reach out to you?

211
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,690
She did once earlier this year.

212
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,120
She asked to meet up.

213
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,930
I was surprised

214
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,360
because we hadn't contacted
for so many years.

215
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,120
My girlfriend happened to be with me,

216
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,090
so the three of us met up.

217
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,970
Why did you bring
your current girlfriend

218
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,090
to meet your ex?

219
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,360
What were you thinking?

220
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:43,970
I didn't want any trouble.

221
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,480
You didn't want trouble?

222
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,170
Did Liu Yingying
ever cause you any trouble?

223
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:55,600
Not exactly trouble.

224
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,290
She just asked me for help
booking a doctor’s appointment.

225
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,450
What kind of appointment?

226
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,360
An appointment with a specialist
at the hospital.

227
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:04,120
She had a little girl with her
at the time

228
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,360
and said the child needed treatment.

229
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:06,690
You know

230
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,290
how hard it is to book
an appointment with a specialist,

231
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,520
and scalpers charge a fortune.

232
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,720
She knew I had some connections
in the medical field,

233
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,000
so she reached out to me.

234
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,050
I felt sorry for her,

235
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,290
so I wanted to give her some money.

236
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,520
As soon as I took out the money,

237
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,720
she suddenly ran off.

238
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:20,720
My girlfriend even commented

239
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,330
that she...

240
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,290
She seemed a bit abnormal.

241
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:27,120
She has had a huge change
over the years.

242
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,330
I can't believe

243
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,930
I used to have feelings for her.

244
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:37,760
If the two of you

245
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,760
had stayed together back then...

246
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:55,720
How's Yingying doing these days?

247
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,520
Yingying has been

248
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,520
working non-stop
for two or three days straight.

249
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,290
Yingying, the arrangements
for the child’s funeral aren’t done yet.

250
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:11,600
You can take your leave first.

251
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,970
Work helps keep my mind off things.

252
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,520
Alright then.

253
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,330
Liang, keep an eye on things.

254
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,120
Alright.

255
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,480
Yingying,

256
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:28,290
don't push yourself.

257
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:29,930
If you feel like crying, just cry.

258
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,330
Head nurse, I'm fine.

259
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,810
Thank you.

260
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:48,400
Her child is still lying in the morgue.

261
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,720
But she's been working non-stop.

262
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,120
She says it helps her feel better,

263
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,000
I think it does help.

264
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:57,090
Since the night of the incident,
she's been at work continuously.

265
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,930
Wang Liang arrived around 6:00 PM.

266
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,520
Manager Wang, you are here.

267
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:12,570
Yingying is changing
the patient's dressings.

268
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:13,930
You can wait for her inside.

269
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,000
Have you eaten yet?

270
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:30,520
No, not yet.

271
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:34,290
You should eat something.

272
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:36,290
I don’t have an appetite.

273
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,120
Yingying, you haven’t slept
in three days.

274
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,360
You should go rest in the break room.

275
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,330
I can handle things here.

276
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:47,170
I’m fine, just feeling
a bit tight in the chest.

277
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,240
Yeah, Yingying.

278
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,640
Tonight we don’t have many patients.

279
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,090
You can go take a break.

280
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:54,000
Sis, leave this to me.

281
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,520
Please go rest for a while.

282
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,810
Leave this to me.

283
00:16:58,290 --> 00:16:59,400
Thank you.

284
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:00,810
No problem. Don't worry.

285
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:01,570
Go rest.

286
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:02,970
Keep an eye on the patient in bed three.

287
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:03,480
Got it.

288
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,770
Manager Wang, you should
go accompany Yingying.

289
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:07,360
Thank you.

290
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,120
It's nothing.

291
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,010
Commissioner Liu, take a look at this.

292
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,960
Wang Liang entered

293
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,010
the hospital at 6:21 PM,

294
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,010
showed up at the nurse's station
at 6:29 PM,

295
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,160
and went to the nurse's break room
at the end of the corridor

296
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,920
with Liu Yingying at 6:35 PM.

297
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:25,880
They stayed in the break room

298
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,360
until 9:40 PM.

299
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:29,330
Then, Wang Liang left on his own

300
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,010
and Liu Yingying remained there.

301
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,570
Her colleague checked on her
a couple of times,

302
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,400
confirming she stayed there
the whole time.

303
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:40,330
She clocked out at 6:00 AM
the next morning.

304
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,330
Later, we found out

305
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:43,600
in Liu Sancheng's phone

306
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,770
that he called her phone.

307
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,090
Did Liu Yingying explain

308
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,730
why she was on the phone
with Liu Sancheng for so long

309
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:49,600
the night of the incident?

310
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,880
She said after her child passed away,

311
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,120
she was devastated and at one
point didn’t want to live anymore.

312
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:55,880
She was talking to Liu Sancheng,

313
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,400
sharing her feelings,

314
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:00,050
and he consoled her.

315
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:02,090
In the end, she promised him
she would keep living.

316
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,730
She had no idea

317
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,530
her father was still worried

318
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,120
and went out on his own after that.

319
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,090
But from the timeline,

320
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,330
it seems she was with Wang Liang

321
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:14,770
while talking to Liu Sancheng
on the phone.

322
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:19,530
Did you find any clues
at the heating station?

323
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,160
All the evidence at the scene was clear.

324
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,530
Two years ago,
they installed a camera there,

325
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,160
but it broke over a year ago

326
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,090
and was never repaired.

327
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:28,330
That means the heating station

328
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:29,730
has no useful clues now.

329
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,680
After the incident,

330
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,570
we tested the blood of the three workers

331
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:36,680
at the heating station.

332
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,120
The tests showed

333
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,490
high levels of barbiturates

334
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:44,680
in their blood samples,

335
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:45,920
which explains

336
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,640
why they were in such a deep sleep

337
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,880
when we arrived.

338
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,680
It’s sedative.

339
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,290
This is significant.

340
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,880
All three had barbiturates
in their blood samples?

341
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,250
I specially checked
on Wang Liang’s levels,

342
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,120
and the results show
they all had similar amounts.

343
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:04,960
So, does that mean

344
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,600
none of the three workers

345
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,010
could have carried the body
into the boiler?

346
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,330
Based on the amount of sedative
in their blood,

347
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:13,330
it seems unlikely.

348
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:14,770
But, there are other suspicious details.

349
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,920
What is that?

350
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:20,960
After the incident,

351
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,400
we questioned the other two workers.

352
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,290
You can have a look.

353
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,730
They said the supper that night

354
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:29,570
was brought by Wang Liang.

355
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,920
It included pork head
and half a roasted chicken.

356
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,680
You can see in the footage

357
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,920
that Wang Liang carried two plastic bags

358
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,730
from the moment
he entered the hospital until he left.

359
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:40,850
And when he and Liu Yingying

360
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,920
went into the nurse’s break room,

361
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:43,960
he placed those plastic bags

362
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,920
on the table at the nurse’s station.

363
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,010
After they had supper,

364
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:50,160
they threw the plastic bags
and disposable chopsticks

365
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,730
into the boiler.

366
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:54,530
The beer glasses they used
were also washed.

367
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,010
Although we didn’t find traces of drugs

368
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,810
on the beer glasses,

369
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,010
we can confirm

370
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,770
that Wang Liang brought them the food.

371
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,120
There’s one more thing

372
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,920
that seems suspicious to me.

373
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:09,920
Look.

374
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:13,090
I think Wang Liang deliberately

375
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:14,250
placed the two plastic bags

376
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,090
right under the surveillance camera.

377
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,330
That does seem deliberate.

378
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,640
But he ate the food himself too,

379
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,090
didn’t he?

380
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,290
Who knows?

381
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,120
Maybe this is the killer's arrangement,

382
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,010
letting Wang Liang
to drug the workers,

383
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:31,880
creating an opportunity
to hide the body.

384
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,160
Who is the killer then?

385
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:38,090
Liu Yingying.

386
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,360
That's unlikely.

387
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,050
First of all,

388
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,810
Liu Sancheng is her biological father.

389
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:49,880
Also,

390
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,530
how could Liu Yingying carry a man
weighing over 140 pounds

391
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,530
with her small frame?

392
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,920
So there must be someone else
involved in this case.

393
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,530
At first, I didn’t think Liu Yingying
was involved either,

394
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:05,730
but now Wang Liang is the prime suspect.

395
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,250
And, Liu Yingying provided him
with an alibi.

396
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,960
So, that means Liu Yingying
might be involved after all.

397
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:11,880
Ms. Luo.

398
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:12,920
Wang Liang is here.

399
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:21,010
Li, have you done eating? Follow me.

400
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:32,850
- Wang Liang.
- Ms. Luo.

401
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,730
Have your seat.

402
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,330
Thank you for coming.

403
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,600
I know you’ve had a lot going on
at home these past few days.

404
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,880
Ms. Luo, why did you call me in?

405
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,330
Call me Officer Luo.

406
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:53,330
Wang Liang,

407
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,330
tell us exactly what you did

408
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:58,330
on March 20th.

409
00:21:58,330 --> 00:21:59,360
Be as detailed as possible,

410
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,440
don’t leave anything out.

411
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,680
Why do I need to tell you?

412
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:03,600
Are you suspecting me?

413
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:05,490
It's just procedure.

414
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,920
Haven’t you been through this
twice already?

415
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:10,090
Eight years ago, didn’t it go
like this with Chen too?

416
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,200
This is for your own good.

417
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:18,120
Just tell us.

418
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:20,530
That day,

419
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,090
I went up the mountain
to buy a stone slab.

420
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:26,530
I wanted to make
a gravestone for Duoduo.

421
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,770
On the way back,

422
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:30,600
I ran into Officer Chen,

423
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:33,330
and he gave me a ride.

424
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:36,330
He also took me to see Officer Sun
for a blood test,

425
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,330
said he wanted to help me
find my family.

426
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,880
After I left Officer Sun’s place,

427
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,200
it was already getting late,

428
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:44,600
and I remembered Yingying
hadn’t eaten yet,

429
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:49,090
so I bought some cooked food
and went to the hospital to see her.

430
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,920
But she did not have the appetite.

431
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,730
Her colleague saw us

432
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:56,290
and suggested we rest
in the nurse’s station break room.

433
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:57,880
I stayed there until after 9 PM.

434
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,330
As she seemed to feel better, I left.

435
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,400
While you were with Liu Yingying,

436
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,160
did she call Liu Sancheng?

437
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:07,330
Yes, she did.

438
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,400
What did they talk about?

439
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,490
Yingying was very upset.

440
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:15,730
But I’m not good with words.

441
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,530
I didn’t know how to comfort her.

442
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,160
And then you called
Liu Sancheng afterwards, didn’t you?

443
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:23,960
Yes.

444
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,680
What’s your relationship
with Liu Sancheng?

445
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,400
He was like a foster father to me.

446
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:35,050
It’s not that simple, is it?

447
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:36,850
Officer Luo.

448
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,680
Are you Duoduo's father?

449
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,640
What does it have to do
with my master's death?

450
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,090
Just answer the questions.

451
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:01,120
Duoduo was a mistake.

452
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:04,530
At the time,
my sister and I were both young,

453
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,440
and we lost control for a moment.

454
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:10,090
I’ve always felt deeply guilty
toward my master,

455
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:12,120
and especially toward Yingying.

456
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:14,290
He had only just taken me in
as his foster son,

457
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:15,250
and I…

458
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:17,360
How do you feel

459
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:18,850
about Liu Sancheng’s death?

460
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,600
My master was very good to me.

461
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:28,850
I was so close with him
than with my real father.

462
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:31,250
He raised me.

463
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,090
I can’t understand it.

464
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:35,680
He never had any enemies.

465
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,440
How could this happen to him?

466
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:39,440
And, I was at the station that night,

467
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,680
That person killed him

468
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,850
right in front of me.

469
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:44,440
When I recall this, I...

470
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:48,050
Officer Luo, I beg you.

471
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,490
Please, I'm begging you
to find the killer.

472
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,050
Please, I'm begging you
to arrest the killer.

473
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,880
I'm begging you.

474
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:00,250
Please, I'm begging you
to arrest the killer.

475
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,440
What time did you arrive
at the hospital that day?

476
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:26,120
6:00 PM.

477
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:27,530
What time did you leave?

478
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,050
A little after 9:00 PM.

479
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,250
Did Liu Yingying
call Liu Sancheng first,

480
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,640
or did you?

481
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,050
We have rice for lunch.

482
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,640
Officer Luo, you are here.

483
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,680
I come to observe again.

484
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,400
One of your colleagues is inside there.

485
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,200
Really?

486
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:04,730
Yes.

487
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,160
You are back.

488
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,250
Let's talk about it.

489
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,120
Sure.

490
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,640
It's reasonable for you
to suspect Liu Yingying.

491
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,290
I’m starting to think
she could be involved.

492
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,680
If Wang Liang drugged the workers,

493
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,330
the person most likely to help him
would be Liu Yingying.

494
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,090
First, because of their relationship,

495
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:41,050
and, because she works at the hospital.

496
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,730
Obtaining sedatives

497
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,200
would be easy.

498
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:45,730
And, look...

499
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:50,730
Wang Liang placed the two bags of food

500
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:52,010
in a very deliberate spot,

501
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,730
right under the surveillance camera.

502
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,200
We all think it was intentional.

503
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,120
Those two bags of food

504
00:26:58,530 --> 00:26:59,810
weren’t touched by anyone.

505
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:03,850
If Liu Yingying gave him the drugs,

506
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,090
it would’ve been easy for Wang Liang

507
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,050
to slip them into the food

508
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,730
on his way back to the heating station.

509
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,600
Even so,

510
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,090
we still couldn't figure out

511
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:18,290
who actually killed Liu Sancheng.

512
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:20,600
On the night of the incident,

513
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:24,290
Liu Sancheng disappeared around 8:00 PM

514
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:27,400
from an area with no surveillance

515
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:28,850
and never appeared again.

516
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:32,850
During that time, Wang Liang
and Liu Yingying were together

517
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,490
in the hospital break room.

518
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,360
Wang Liang left the hospital

519
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,600
at around 9:40 PM,

520
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:42,250
and arrived at the heating station
just after 10:00 PM.

521
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:45,730
The hospital is about five kilometers
from the heating station,

522
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,330
so the timing fits

523
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:48,600
if he rode his motorcycle.

524
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:51,770
But,

525
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:55,640
between 8:00 PM and 10:00 PM,

526
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:57,680
where was

527
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,290
Liu Sancheng going?

528
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:02,730
He couldn’t have just been
waiting to be killed, could he?

529
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:05,490
I think

530
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:08,010
there must be a third person

531
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,290
with Liu Yingying and Wang Liang.

532
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:12,920
Liu Yingying and Wang Liang
handled the drugs.

533
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,490
And this other person killed
Liu Sancheng somewhere in between

534
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:17,250
and then stuffed his body
into the boiler

535
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:18,600
while everyone was asleep

536
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:20,440
around 3:00 AM.

537
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:24,640
What's your thought?

538
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:31,250
That’s possible.

539
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:35,200
Wang Liang and the two workers

540
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,490
ate the drugged meal

541
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:40,570
and fell asleep

542
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:42,600
around 11:00 PM.

543
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:46,290
But why would the killer
wait until 3:00 AM

544
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,050
to put the body in the boiler?"

545
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,050
We haven’t figured that out yet either.

546
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,730
Chen Jianghe,
you’re not just working on a case.

547
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:59,680
You’re dealing with people's lives here.

548
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,640
If it weren’t for the
reinvestigation of this case,

549
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:10,200
I might have gone
my entire police career

550
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,640
without understanding
these two sentences.

551
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:19,730
I went to Luoche.

552
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,850
Did you find anything?

553
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,640
I met Liu Sancheng’s mother-in-law,

554
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:28,680
Liu Yingying’s grandmother.

555
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,400
After his wife died,

556
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,920
Liu Sancheng never remarried.

557
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,530
Back then, Liu Yingying was only eight.

558
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,090
Her brother, Liu Dazhi, was six.

559
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:45,920
Liu Yingying was the
only woman left in the family.

560
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:51,640
At eight years old, she had
to be a mother, a daughter,

561
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:52,960
and a sister all at once.

562
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,850
She took care of her father
and her brother,

563
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:57,200
handled the household chores,

564
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:02,530
and still managed to do well
in her academics.

565
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:05,810
How did she do it?

566
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:07,730
How did she manage?

567
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:13,040
[Nurse's Rest Station]

568
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:15,250
Is Nurse Zhao here?

569
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,600
Yes, I'm here. Anything?

570
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,640
The police are here to take a look.

571
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,290
Sure, let them look.

572
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:21,440
Alright, officers, go ahead.

573
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,440
Thank you. Thank you.

574
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:51,290
A small window leads outside.

575
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,810
So it's possible

576
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:02,730
that both of them
could have climbed out of here.

577
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,120
They’re both involved in the case.

578
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:08,090
I still can’t believe
that Liu Yingying would kill her father.

579
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,200
Why not?

580
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:25,730
When I was six,

581
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:28,120
my father passed away.

582
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,360
But I never felt like

583
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,330
life without a father

584
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:35,440
was any different

585
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,330
because I had an older brother.

586
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:40,920
My brother is five years older than me.

587
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:45,600
I grew up on his back.

588
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:48,120
So

589
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:49,490
I understand very well

590
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,600
the bond between family members
in situations like this.

591
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,010
Family ties are incredibly strong.

592
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:03,330
That’s why I don’t want
to believe it either.

593
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:29,960
It is a toilet.

594
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:03,330
Commissioner Liu.

595
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:04,920
Commissioner Liu.

596
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:07,330
It was an old lady.

597
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:09,010
She saw the car parked

598
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:10,050
at her door early in the morning,

599
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,440
got tempted,

600
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:13,730
and moved it into her yard.

601
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,880
But then, when she saw
the notice we posted,

602
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,360
she quickly returned it.

603
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,050
Where does the old lady live?

604
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:34,360
In the alley at the bend.

605
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:35,600
Near the heating station.

606
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:38,360
Send it for testing

607
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:39,810
Alright.

608
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,530
Why would the killer wait until 3:00 AM

609
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:52,570
to stuff the body into the boiler?

610
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:54,290
Could it be

611
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:56,490
that they first hid the body
somewhere else,

612
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,330
and only when it was silent
in the midnight

613
00:33:58,330 --> 00:33:59,570
did they move it into the boiler?

614
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:04,730
But Liu Sancheng disappeared at 8:00 PM.

615
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,170
If he was killed at that time,

616
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:12,880
wouldn't moving and hiding the body

617
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:16,440
then actually increase
the risk of getting caught?

618
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,960
Master, do you guys remove the slag

619
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,690
after every time you add coal?

620
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,880
Not necessarily.

621
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:32,250
Usually, after we add coal,
we remove the slag.

622
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:34,000
Why?

623
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,960
Otherwise, the next time we add coal,

624
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:38,650
the back slag box gets full,

625
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:41,480
and cleaning it becomes more difficult.

626
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,360
So, we clean it

627
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:46,480
when we add coal.

628
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,400
What would happen
if you didn’t remove the slag?

629
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,170
Of course, the manager would scold us.

630
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:55,290
The back slag box would get clogged,

631
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,690
and the burnt coal wouldn’t drop down.

632
00:34:57,770 --> 00:34:59,440
We’d have to burn it all over again.

633
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,650
It’s just a waste of time.

634
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,560
Burning it again...

635
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:09,250
Wasting...

636
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:20,850
I’m such an idiot.

637
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,400
You figured something out?

638
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,170
Remember our pig experiment?

639
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:26,960
It took four hours and seven minutes

640
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,170
for the remains to fall down
after burning,

641
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:28,920
right?

642
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,480
Yeah, it matches.

643
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,330
According to the workers,

644
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:36,000
every time they add coal,
they remove the slag as well.

645
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:39,210
But that morning at 5:00 AM,

646
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:40,770
they added coal
without removing the slag."

647
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:45,770
If the killer had put
the body into the boiler

648
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:46,810
at 11:00 PM

649
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,730
or 12:00 AM,

650
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:50,290
in a normal condition,

651
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:53,360
the body would have fallen
into the slag box.

652
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,440
If the workers had removed
the slag normally,

653
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:57,690
they would have found
Liu Sancheng's body,

654
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:00,690
just like how Cheng Chun’s body was
discovered as charred remains back then.

655
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,210
So, the killer delayed
putting the body in.

656
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:06,360
Even if the workers had removed the slag

657
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,000
at 5:00 AM,

658
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:09,850
the body wouldn’t have appeared yet.

659
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,360
This killer

660
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,360
knows the workers' routine

661
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,730
and understands the boiler operation.

662
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:17,650
They even knew about
what happened back then.

663
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:19,960
That's why they calculated that 3:00 AM

664
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,850
was the best time to place
the body into the boiler.

665
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:23,400
The killer is an insider.

666
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,650
This killer is very cunning.

667
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,960
They woke the workers up
at 5:00 AM to add coal

668
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,080
but didn’t remind them
to remove the slag,

669
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,810
just to ensure the body

670
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,770
would burn longer
and be destroyed completely.

671
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,690
They even took the drugs
and slept deeply through the night.

672
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,850
That’s how clever they are.

673
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:46,400
Their blood even contained

674
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,810
a high concentration of barbiturates.

675
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:49,770
How did they make it?

676
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:51,170
Just staying awake.

677
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:53,170
The day before yesterday,
we were in the yard,

678
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:54,400
waiting for the pig to fall.

679
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,170
He was holding a teacup,

680
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,210
asking us if we wanted tea.

681
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,480
I noticed there was a deep bite mark

682
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,040
on his right hand.

683
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:03,690
He estimated everything,

684
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,610
but he didn't expect us

685
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,850
to conduct the pig experiment suddenly.

686
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,360
We should thank to you,

687
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,000
helping us to confirm the suspect.

688
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:17,040
Really?

689
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,290
Yes.

690
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:20,400
What about Liu Yingying?

691
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:21,880
Which of them is the mastermind?

692
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,250
I'm not sure yet.

693
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,480
Patricide...

694
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,650
It's just unimaginable.

695
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,960
What happened at that time?

696
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:44,330
Hello.

697
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:45,360
Chen.

698
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:47,610
we’ve found the transaction records
of Cheng Chun's bank card.

699
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,250
Great!

700
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:53,290
It's strange.

701
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,170
Apart from the last withdrawal amount,

702
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:57,810
which matches the one
framing Ding Baoyuan,

703
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,690
the other withdrawals
were all made in the province.

704
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:03,520
They were respectively withdrawn
in March and September of 2002,

705
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,360
and in March and September 2003.

706
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,560
The time frame is the same
for two consecutive years.

707
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,770
The amounts were

708
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:10,560
always just over 3,600.

709
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,170
That can’t be a coincidence, right?

710
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,610
Could it be that Cheng Chun went
to the province for buying goods?

711
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:17,400
Why would he need to go
to the province for the goods?

712
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:20,000
And why would the amounts
and timing be so consistent?

713
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,360
Chen, where are you going?

714
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:29,770
Madam Song.

715
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:31,400
Chen.

716
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:33,170
I need to talk to you for a bit

717
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:35,170
Alright, I’ll come down.

718
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,250
When he was little,
he was called Liu Dafu.

719
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,000
Now, he is called Liu Dazhi.

720
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,690
Dafu was the name his dad gave him.

721
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:47,650
Dazhi

722
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:49,610
is the name he chose for himself
after he left.

723
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:52,210
Speaking of Liu Sancheng’s son,

724
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,960
he is really a success.

725
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,170
He works in a major bank
in the province.

726
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,610
I heard he’s in a management position.

727
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,400
He must be very rich.

728
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,560
Madam Song, it's tough

729
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:07,610
for someone from our small town

730
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:08,880
to become a college student.

731
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,850
They had two college students
from one family.

732
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,210
That's something to be proud of.

733
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:14,360
Absolutely.

734
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:16,360
When they were young,

735
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,810
their family didn’t have much.

736
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,360
The siblings were two years
behind their peers

737
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,810
in starting school,

738
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:23,770
but once they started,

739
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:26,040
their grades were excellent.

740
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:28,810
Both of them got into universities
in the province.

741
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:34,130
After Liu Dazhi started working,

742
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:35,440
has he ever come back?

743
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,210
No, he hasn’t.

744
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,130
I heard

745
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:42,960
he married the daughter of a
high-ranking official in the province.

746
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:46,770
But when they got married,
he didn’t even invite his father.

747
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:47,560
Really?

748
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,040
Then he had a son
and said he’d come back to visit.

749
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:54,850
You saw Liu Sancheng's car, right?

750
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,690
The one with the poster on it?

751
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:58,480
It was for his grandson,

752
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:00,360
but it was all done for nothing.

753
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,360
He never came back.

754
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,000
Didn't even bother to show up.

755
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,650
Did he come back
during his university years?

756
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:12,560
At that time,

757
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:16,170
I think he did.

758
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:17,850
He did.

759
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:46,130
Officer Chen.

760
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,770
This is the classroom roster
from back then.

761
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,290
That year was my first year
staying on at the school,

762
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:55,290
and I was their class counselor.

763
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:57,480
I remember

764
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:00,400
Dazhi had excellent grades
when he entered,

765
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:02,810
and he was always a diligent student,

766
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:04,360
though he didn’t talk much.

767
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,440
Ms. Xu, do you remember

768
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,210
how much the tuition was each semester
back in 2002?

769
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,960
That depends on the major course.

770
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:24,960
For the finance major Dazhi was in,

771
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,400
it was around 3,600 per semester,

772
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:33,730
but I can’t recall the exact figure.

773
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:38,960
Could you make a copy of this for me?

774
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:40,360
Sure.

775
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:40,880
Thanks.

776
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,040
Let me do it. No problem.

777
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,880
Through our re-investigation
of the Ding Baoyuan case,

778
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,360
we’ve indeed found many doubts.

779
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:02,080
Ding Baoyuan couldn’t
have been the killer.

780
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:05,960
Our initial work wasn’t thorough,

781
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:08,480
leading to a wrongful conviction.

782
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,400
We will now carefully review
and correct it.

783
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:14,960
If you need our cooperation

784
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,040
in the re-investigation,

785
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:18,770
we will fully support you.

786
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:23,130
Luo, hand over the materials
we’ve compiled

787
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:24,610
to the comrades
from the prosecutor’s office.

788
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:31,170
The police

789
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:33,210
have already done
much of the groundwork.

790
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:36,400
This will save a lot of time.

791
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:37,960
We will go back

792
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:41,400
and investigate the materials carefully.

793
00:43:41,770 --> 00:43:43,040
Then, we will conduct
further re-investigations

794
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,770
based on this foundation.

795
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,810
If this is indeed a wrongful case,

796
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:49,610
we must uphold the spirit
of rectifying wrong cases

797
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,360
and investigating it thoroughly.

798
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,080
Prosecutors.

799
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:03,040
Nice to meet you. I'm Chen Jianghe.
Thank you for your hard work.

800
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:05,040
Eight years ago,

801
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,610
I was involved in Ding Baoyuan's case.

802
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:09,480
Now I'm assisting
with the re-investigation.

803
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,170
What I wanted to say is that back then,

804
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:12,650
when we were investigating the case,

805
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,880
there were different
perspectives to consider.

806
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,610
The main factor was
that Ding Baoyuan suddenly fled,

807
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:18,770
and after we caught him,
he voluntarily confessed

808
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:20,170
to being the culprit.

809
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,850
That influenced our judgment.

810
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:22,610
Chen.

811
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:24,130
Officer Chen.

812
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:25,960
Regardless of the reason,

813
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,210
a wrongful conviction
is a wrongful conviction.

814
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,770
We're not here to assign blame.

815
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,360
If a case turns out to be wrong,

816
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:36,170
then all of us, the public security,
prosecutors and the courts are responsible.

817
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,650
Now we have to face

818
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:40,210
history and the facts together.

819
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,080
Yes, you're right.

820
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:43,250
Yes, you're right.

821
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:45,810
We do need to face
the facts and history,.

822
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:47,210
But that’s not what I meant.

823
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:49,080
What I’m saying is that Ding Baoyuan

824
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,650
wouldn’t confess for no reason.

825
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:53,170
There must have been a cause.

826
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:54,960
Then what do you think

827
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:57,400
was the reason

828
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,040
for Ding Baoyuan’s voluntary confession?

829
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,290
Prosecutor Wang.

830
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:03,520
Regarding this incident,

831
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:05,480
we have noticed some doubts as well.

832
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:05,920
Commissioner.

833
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,290
We’ve documented everything
in the case files.

834
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,210
I’ll explain this

835
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:10,000
to you thoroughly later.

836
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,250
Are you a fool?

837
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:17,360
We need to find the reason.

838
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:18,810
Isn't that what we're doing now
is finding the reason?

839
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:22,170
What were you trying to do,
Chen Jianghe?

840
00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:24,770
What did I do?

841
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:25,810
When they were here,

842
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:28,250
you were acting rashly.

843
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,650
What nonsense are you talking about?

844
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:32,960
What did I say?

845
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:34,960
What did you say?

846
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,610
What nonsense did you tell the people
from the prosecutor’s office?

847
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:38,610
Did you forget?

848
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,080
That's nothing. I...

849
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:44,210
I was looking for evidence.
What’s wrong with that?

850
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:45,560
Now they think

851
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:47,250
we used coercion to extract
a confession from Ding Baoyuan.

852
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:48,040
Don’t you get that?

853
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:51,130
They...

854
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,400
They think that?

855
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:55,080
Really?

856
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:56,360
What did you think?

857
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:57,810
Are you an idiot?

858
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:01,960
Commissioner Liu, Ms. Wang is here.

859
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:03,560
Come in.

860
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,400
Ms. Wang, what brings you here?

861
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,360
Hi, Ms. Wang.

862
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:07,850
Are you busy?

863
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,810
Not really, we're just chatting.

864
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,000
How's the master doing?

865
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:13,080
He is doing well.

866
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:15,610
I wanted to talk to Jianghe.

867
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:17,770
Jianghe, have your seat.

868
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,480
You asked me last time

869
00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:23,440
about whether Ge had a case
he couldn’t let go of.

870
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:25,690
I told you it was
the heating station case,

871
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:26,440
remember?

872
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:27,850
Yes, I remember.

873
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,610
I just recalled something,

874
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:31,770
at the time of the incident,

875
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:33,290
Ge hired a truck

876
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,040
to bring back a load of coal slag

877
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,880
and kept it
in the store room downstairs.

878
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:38,770
After work,

879
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:40,650
he’d go down
and sift through the coal slag.

880
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,960
The neighbours teased me
that Ge was thrifty,

881
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,810
trying to sift out some usable coal

882
00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:48,040
from the coal slag

883
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:49,960
for our own usage.

884
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:53,290
I knew it was just his way of coping,

885
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,000
he was trying to find something

886
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,480
from the coal slay.

887
00:46:58,130 --> 00:46:59,080
What was he trying to find?

888
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,440
I have no idea

889
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,210
of why he did that.

890
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,810
He never finished sifting
before the incident happened.

891
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:14,960
Ge

892
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,360
wasn’t a man of great talent,

893
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:20,040
but if you gave him one word,

894
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:21,650
it would be 'stubborn'.

895
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:26,480
He was so stubborn his whole life.

896
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:34,810
I heard the prosecutor’s office
is involved now.

897
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,250
Yes, they come down
several times a year.

898
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:40,850
It’s normal handover work.

899
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,560
So, this is

900
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,810
really a wrong case.

901
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:03,360
Ge has worked in the public security
all his life.

902
00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:06,170
Before he ended his career life,

903
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,360
he still wrongly judged the case.

904
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:10,650
Ms. Wang, it's not like that.

905
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:12,170
This case

906
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:13,880
has nothing to do with Ge.

907
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,170
Back then, many of us on the team

908
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,520
thought the case

909
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,440
was incontrovertible
and could be closed.

910
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:21,880
Only Ge

911
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:22,960
had doubts about the case.

912
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:24,650
He felt there were still clues.

913
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:25,560
So he kept investigating,

914
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:26,960
even when all the evidence

915
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,650
was diminished.

916
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:29,960
He never gave up.

917
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,520
This case has nothing to do with him.

918
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,360
If Ge is conscious now,

919
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:35,880
he wouldn't have said that.

920
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:40,290
If it's wrong, it's wrong.

921
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:54,810
You all stay busy.

922
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:56,690
I'll head back now.

923
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:58,480
Ms. Wang, let me send you off.

924
00:48:58,520 --> 00:48:59,560
No need. No need.

925
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,610
Focus on your work. Thank you.

926
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,130
There are 35 people
in the singing group.

927
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:24,210
[Mathematics]
How many times more are the singers compared to the dancers?

928
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:25,920
Who is it?

929
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:29,130
Who is it?

930
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:30,040
Luo Yingwei.

931
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:39,000
Officer Luo.

932
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,770
Hi, Luo.

933
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:41,960
This is...

934
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:42,770
My colleague.

935
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:43,880
Come in, please.

936
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:44,960
Sorry to bother you.

937
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:47,250
That's fine. Have your seat.

938
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:50,000
There's the couch.

939
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,920
Please have your seat.

940
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:53,170
Thank you.

941
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:54,560
Would you like something to drink?
I can make some tea.

942
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,170
No need. I brought my own water.

943
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,560
You carry your own water?

944
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:00,960
Well then, I won't make the tea.

945
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:02,880
Don't be so busy.

946
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:04,810
Are you home alone?

947
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:11,000
Qiao and Zhuang
are asleep in their rooms.

948
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,360
Still sleeping during the day?

949
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:15,400
As the authors,

950
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,610
they have irregular schedules.

951
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:20,360
They work at night
and sleep during the day.

952
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:21,960
Recently, they have a new novel

953
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,170
being serialized online,

954
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:25,000
and need to write 5,000 words a day.

955
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,810
Only I realise that it's tough
being an author.

956
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:28,560
It's tougher than farming.

957
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:31,400
The novel is called 'Crazy in Love'.

958
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,880
Have you read it? It's very popular now.

959
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:33,650
I didn't come

960
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:35,810
to chat about life today.

961
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:38,650
I’m here to talk about something else.

962
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:39,400
What is it?

963
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:41,610
Officer Chen

964
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:43,170
shared

965
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:44,880
a very interesting theory
with me earlier.

966
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:48,440
He believes that Ding Baoyuan
went to prison

967
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:49,650
because he was covering for someone.

968
00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:51,770
At the time, I didn’t think
much of it,

969
00:50:52,330 --> 00:50:53,130
but later,

970
00:50:53,730 --> 00:50:54,770
I gave it some thought.

971
00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:56,400
Were you the one
who Ding Baoyuan was covering for?

972
00:50:58,330 --> 00:51:00,960
Luo, what are you saying?

973
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:04,400
Why would he cover for me?

974
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:05,650
I haven’t committed any crime.

975
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:06,440
Alright.

976
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:08,250
Let me analyze this for you.

977
00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:11,650
Before the incident
of the heating station,

978
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,040
you and Qiao were
already dating each other, right?

979
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:20,000
And you wanted to take possession

980
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,080
of Ding Baoyuan’s assets.

981
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,000
So,

982
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:25,040
you framed Ding Baoyuan.

983
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:27,880
Does that reason sound plausible?

984
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:31,330
Luo.

985
00:51:31,330 --> 00:51:32,170
Officer Luo.

986
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,360
Come on, Officer Luo.

987
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:37,400
You should be a novelist.

988
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:38,560
I can't do that.

989
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,610
You're too polite.
You can even make up the stories.

990
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:43,040
It is indeed an interesting storyline.

991
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,170
I just wonder,

992
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:48,440
Ding Baoyuan is such a grown man,

993
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:49,960
not a fool.

994
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,080
Would he believe it

995
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:53,770
if I said I committed murder?

996
00:51:54,770 --> 00:51:56,170
The night of the
heating station incident,

997
00:51:56,210 --> 00:51:58,330
only Ding Baoyuan
and his apprentice Liu Sancheng

998
00:51:58,330 --> 00:51:59,480
were on duty.

999
00:52:00,170 --> 00:52:00,730
Then, I...

1000
00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:02,880
checked your
household registration records.

1001
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:05,960
Both you and Wang Liang
are from Luo Che.

1002
00:52:07,810 --> 00:52:09,770
So, you got Wang Liang to lie for you.

1003
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,810
Of course, this is all just my analysis,

1004
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,360
and I hope it’s not true.

1005
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:19,850
But if it is,

1006
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:21,130
Sun Caiyun,

1007
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,560
you’re guilty of obstructing justice.

1008
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:30,690
Officer Luo.

1009
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,560
I do know a little

1010
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:35,610
about your procedures.

1011
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:41,000
Back then, the only reason
the police brought me in for questioning

1012
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:44,360
was because Ding Baoyuan suddenly fled.

1013
00:52:45,770 --> 00:52:47,210
If I had committed that,

1014
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:48,730
what was it you said?

1015
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:49,440
What was it?

1016
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,650
Obstructing justice.

1017
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:51,360
Yeah.

1018
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,480
If I had committed that crime,

1019
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:56,170
would we be sitting here chatting

1020
00:52:56,170 --> 00:52:56,880
like this?

1021
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,250
I'm thinking

1022
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:01,360
you must have re-interrogated

1023
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:02,440
Ding Baoyuan by now, right?

1024
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:04,610
What did he say?

1025
00:53:04,650 --> 00:53:05,690
He said he was innocent.

1026
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:09,610
Whether or not he’s guilty,

1027
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,480
you would know better than us.

1028
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:15,730
You’re aware

1029
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:17,810
we’re currently re-investigating
Ding Baoyuan’s case.

1030
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:19,960
If Ding Baoyuan gets out,

1031
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:22,480
you should think carefully

1032
00:53:22,730 --> 00:53:24,170
about how you’ll explain things to him.

1033
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:28,960
You still have my name card, right?

1034
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:31,250
Call me if anything comes up.

1035
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,850
I get to go now.

1036
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:38,810
Wait a moment, Luo.

1037
00:53:39,290 --> 00:53:41,170
Last time you gave me that name card,

1038
00:53:41,170 --> 00:53:42,920
I accidentally misplaced it.

1039
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,170
Could you give me your number again?

1040
00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:45,210
I already have your number.

1041
00:53:45,810 --> 00:53:47,520
Li, leave your number too.

1042
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:48,170
Sure.

1043
00:53:49,770 --> 00:53:50,560
Here's my number.

1044
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,210
If you remember anything important,

1045
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:53,250
don’t hesitate to reach out.

1046
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:53,730
Thank you.

1047
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:55,810
Don’t be afraid to bother me, just call.

1048
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:56,560
Alright.

1049
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:57,170
We get to go.

1050
00:53:57,170 --> 00:53:57,960
Okay.

1051
00:53:58,520 --> 00:53:59,850
Let me send you off.

1052
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:00,690
No need.

1053
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:04,610
We're leaving.

1054
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:05,960
Be careful.

1055
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:07,000
See you.

1056
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:21,770
Luo.

1057
00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:24,560
The things you told
Sun Caiyun earlier

1058
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:25,770
are true or fake?

1059
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,000
What logic is that?

1060
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,290
It’s too far-fetched.

1061
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:29,960
That’s Sun Caiyun’s logic.

1062
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,810
We can’t do much
about Wang Liang for now,

1063
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:34,440
and we haven’t found any breakthroughs.

1064
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:36,610
So, we came to see

1065
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:38,250
if we could get any new leads
from Sun Caiyun.

1066
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,250
If that’s the case,

1067
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:42,000
then Wang Liang is directly connected

1068
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,360
to the case from eight years ago.

1069
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:44,770
That's my inference.

1070
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:49,690
Get up! Get up! Something happens.

1071
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:51,690
Pack our things now.

1072
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,130
What's going on?

1073
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:54,810
We can’t stay here anymore. Get up now!

1074
00:54:54,810 --> 00:54:55,730
What happens?

1075
00:54:55,730 --> 00:54:57,040
Ding Baoyuan is coming back.

1076
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:58,480
Zhuang, wake up.

1077
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:02,360
Ding Baoyuan?

1078
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:12,330
- Zhuang, grab your backpack.
- So, that means

1079
00:55:12,330 --> 00:55:14,130
someone vindicated him.

1080
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:18,480
Exactly.

1081
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,360
He has such a good fate.

1082
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:22,920
That's right.

1083
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:26,250
You know, he's going
to get a big payout.

1084
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:29,170
What did you say?

1085
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,440
State compensation!

1086
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:33,250
Eight years.

1087
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,610
He's been in prison for eight years.

1088
00:55:34,610 --> 00:55:35,650
He will receive a huge compensation.

1089
00:55:35,650 --> 00:55:36,400
Lend me a hand.

1090
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:38,170
He'll be compensated
for one or two million.

1091
00:55:39,810 --> 00:55:40,610
How much?

1092
00:55:40,810 --> 00:55:41,810
One or two million.

1093
00:55:46,770 --> 00:55:48,210
Caiyun, get in the car.

1094
00:56:07,610 --> 00:56:08,330
Qiao.

1095
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:10,040
Get down here.

1096
00:56:19,330 --> 00:56:20,560
It’s been eight or nine years.

1097
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,170
Have you ever sat down and figured out

1098
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:23,960
how much money you’ve made?

1099
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:25,400
What do you mean by that?

1100
00:56:28,170 --> 00:56:29,810
When did you start making money?

1101
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:31,960
Caiyun.

1102
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,130
Talking about money is so low-standard.

1103
00:56:36,770 --> 00:56:37,960
Is it low-standard?

1104
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:40,040
What can we do without money?

1105
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,080
Literature is sacred.

1106
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:46,650
Some people live for material things.

1107
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:49,250
Some live for fame and fortune,

1108
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,960
battling their way through life.

1109
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,960
But we live for the spirit.

1110
00:56:53,290 --> 00:56:54,080
Caiyun.

1111
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:57,400
Literature is our salvation.

1112
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:02,850
Is that so?

1113
00:57:05,810 --> 00:57:07,210
I think so too.

1114
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:10,960
Otherwise, why would

1115
00:57:11,290 --> 00:57:13,040
I have spent
the last eight or nine years

1116
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:14,850
paying for your books to be published

1117
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:16,400
and buying clicks?

1118
00:57:19,290 --> 00:57:22,000
But I must get
something in return, right?

1119
00:57:22,770 --> 00:57:24,960
Caiyun, my love for you,

1120
00:57:25,170 --> 00:57:26,880
isn’t that enough?

1121
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:35,120
More than enough.

1122
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:37,810
Qiao.

1123
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,730
You know I love and pamper you the most,

1124
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:41,240
right?

1125
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:41,880
Yes.

1126
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,120
Otherwise, I wouldn’t have given you

1127
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:48,170
all my time and money
for the past eight or nine years.

1128
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:48,850
Yes.

1129
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,200
I’ve only ever thought about one thing.

1130
00:57:52,490 --> 00:57:53,720
I hope one day

1131
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:55,920
you’ll take me and Zhuang

1132
00:57:56,290 --> 00:57:58,360
to the big city to make a name
for ourselves.

1133
00:57:59,450 --> 00:58:01,010
When are you going to take us?

1134
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:02,290
That day will come.

1135
00:58:03,290 --> 00:58:04,130
Caiyun.

1136
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,720
When you lean on my shoulder,

1137
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:08,610
that’s when I love you the most.

1138
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:11,530
I can feel my soul swaying,

1139
00:58:11,970 --> 00:58:14,840
and I know inspiration
is coming to me again.

1140
00:58:18,690 --> 00:58:20,130
I’m feeling inspired too.

1141
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:26,730
But what does Ding Baoyuan’s release

1142
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:28,650
have to do with us?

1143
00:58:29,730 --> 00:58:31,610
We weren’t the ones
who arrested him, right?

1144
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:34,650
Whoever arrested him,
let him go after them.

1145
00:58:34,730 --> 00:58:36,570
So why do we have to leave?

1146
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:38,000
We’re not leaving.

1147
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:39,920
Not leaving?

1148
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,520
But if he finds out we tricked him,

1149
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:44,400
if he knows about our relationship,

1150
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:45,810
do you think he’ll let me off?

1151
00:58:46,770 --> 00:58:48,480
How could he know?

1152
00:58:49,090 --> 00:58:49,770
Grab this.

1153
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,880
He’s been in prison for eight years.

1154
00:58:52,130 --> 00:58:53,650
I visited him every month.

1155
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:54,880
Moreover,

1156
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:57,520
after eight years in prison,
he’s probably lost his mind.

1157
00:58:57,650 --> 00:58:59,360
It’ll be a miracle if he can
remember how to eat and drink.

1158
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,400
We’ll figure out a way

1159
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:02,960
to get that million or two
in compensation.

1160
00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:04,130
We can't leave.

1161
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:05,360
Not leaving?

1162
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:07,360
But, there will be four of us...

1163
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:09,960
Are you silly?

1164
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:11,770
Writing makes you lose your senses.

1165
00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:15,170
I'll stay here with Zhuang.

1166
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:16,840
You should go back home for now.

1167
00:59:17,090 --> 00:59:18,320
I don’t have a home anymore.

1168
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:19,730
My old house was demolished.

1169
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:20,730
Where can I go?

1170
00:59:22,690 --> 00:59:24,920
You can stay
at your sister’s house for now.

1171
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,960
We’ll work out

1172
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:30,320
how to get
that compensation money later.

1173
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,210
You go and wait for me.

1174
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:36,000
We can’t meet each other
for a while, understand?

1175
00:59:36,130 --> 00:59:36,570
Leave now.

1176
00:59:36,570 --> 00:59:36,920
Okay.

1177
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:38,290
Come on.

1178
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:41,960
Let me say something to the child.

1179
00:59:52,170 --> 00:59:52,810
Father.

1180
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:53,730
Kid,

1181
00:59:55,650 --> 00:59:56,520
in a few days,

1182
00:59:56,730 --> 00:59:58,730
the uncle from prison

1183
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:00,170
will be staying at our home.

1184
01:00:00,690 --> 01:00:03,570
When he comes, you’re going
to call him ‘Father',

1185
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:04,810
okay?

1186
01:00:05,290 --> 01:00:05,880
No.

1187
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:07,770
Be good.

1188
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:09,520
Don't forget, okay?
