00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:06,550
I'm not exactly a great father, am I?

192
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,750
Here's something for your family.

193
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,960
I'm leaving it at the door.

194
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,720
When you see your sister,

195
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,390
explain everything clearly.

196
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,840
Ruirui is still too young

197
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,150
to travel.

198
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,840
I have to stay home to take care of him.

199
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,030
In any case,

200
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,840
don't let your family criticize.

201
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,630
Don't worry.

202
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,870
Also,

203
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,720
be mindful of the funeral expenses.

204
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,390
When your dad was alive,

205
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,120
we didn't skimp on sending
money to your family.

206
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,360
This time, let your sister contribute.

207
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,440
Ruirui is starting kindergarten
next year.

208
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,030
You know how expensive

209
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,120
that is nowadays.

210
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,720
And all those extracurricular classes...

211
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,750
Alright, alright.

212
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,480
I know.

213
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:13,150
Dad, didn't you say yesterday

214
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,790
that you talked to President Luo?

215
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,670
Dad said, once you're back,

216
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,150
he'll take you to meet President Luo.

217
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,390
There's still hope for that vacancy

218
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,750
in the credit department.

219
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,870
Thanks, Dad.

220
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,840
I'm counting on you.

221
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:34,960
Yes.

222
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,480
I reckon the funeral will be
in a couple of days.

223
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,000
I'll be back soon.

224
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,240
Eat.

225
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,600
I'm off.

226
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,030
Son, come here. Give Daddy a hug.

227
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:59,550
What's wrong? You seem down.

228
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,720
Is it because Daddy is leaving?

229
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,360
Give Daddy a kiss.

230
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,150
It's okay, Daddy will be back soon.

231
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,480
Drive safely.

232
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,240
Come back soon.

233
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,360
Dad, I'm heading out.

234
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,960
Sweetie, say goodbye to Daddy.

235
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,120
Listen to Mommy, okay?

236
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:36,570
[Kulu North]

237
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,750
Nothing's changed.

238
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,920
This cursed place.

239
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,480
Take me with you.

240
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,510
Fu,

241
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,590
take me with you.

242
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,510
Zhang Yuan,

243
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,550
what instrument is good
for a ten-year-old girl?

244
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,030
Ten years old?

245
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,750
It's too late to learn any instrument.

246
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,790
I don't expect her to become a virtuoso,

247
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,790
I just want something
to cultivate her interests,

248
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,160
something inexpensive.

249
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,750
Learning an instrument isn't cheap.

250
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,640
How about the viola?

251
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,960
The viola's nice. Very elegant.

252
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,640
Elegant, huh?

253
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,830
Cultivate elegance...

254
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,000
Are the lessons expensive?

255
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,960
How much per session?

256
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,440
Not cheap around here.

257
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,750
You two haven't discussed

258
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,640
the case at all.

259
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,030
What's this about music lessons

260
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,720
and instruments?

261
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,590
You're the leader, you decide.

262
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,960
We now have a suspect,

263
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,880
but no solid evidence.

264
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,110
How about

265
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,720
we bring in Wang Liang for questioning?

266
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,880
Didn't we already question
Wang Liang last time?

267
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,350
Did we get anything out of him?

268
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,240
No.

269
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:40,240
So what are we planning to get
out of him this time?

270
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,200
You decide.

271
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,270
I'm just here to do grunt work

272
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,480
and to assist,
and you want me to decide?

273
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,000
Chen.

274
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,350
The car you asked me to watch,

275
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,550
the one with plate number Ping AW0616,
has entered the city.

276
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,070
What car?

277
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,750
It's coming from the provincial city.

278
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,400
The main character has arrived.

279
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:01,160
Zhang Yuan, how's the surveillance
on Ding Baoyuan?

280
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,750
Still keeping an eye on him.

281
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,590
He's always with Sun Caiyun,

282
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,160
playing mahjong and square dancing.

283
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:06,960
[Liu Dazhi]
Nothing unusual.

284
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,830
Li Rui, the car owner's name
is Liu Dazhi.

285
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,000
Keep a close watch on him.

286
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,110
Will do.

[Haotai Hotel]

288
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,200
Welcome!

289
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,790
At Haotai Hotel, we provide
a five-star experience.

290
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,270
Hello.

291
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:52,960
Hello. Is this really a five-star hotel?

292
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,830
Yes, sir. Almost five stars.

293
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,160
What do you mean by “almost” five stars?

294
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,510
Five-star service.

295
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:06,400
I need a room.

296
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,350
Attendant.

297
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:18,880
Attendant!

298
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,640
What's wrong with the elevator?

299
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,270
Sorry, sir,

300
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,510
the elevator is under maintenance.

301
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Almost five-star,
but the elevator doesn't work?

302
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,000
Sorry, sir.

303
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,440
It will be fixed by tonight.

304
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:43,790
I've just arrived.

305
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,880
There was a sandstorm.

Fifth floor.

307
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,310

Hello, front desk.

00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,480
Don't "hello" me.

311
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,350
Do you not have any attendants?

312
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,400
Yes, we do, sir.

313
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,070
Then send them over!

314
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,550
How can it take so long
to bring a bed sheet?

315
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:16,960
Go in.

316
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,480
How can a person

317
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,960
die just like that?

318
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,510
What illness?

319
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,030
Not an illness.

320
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,440
Then how did he die?

321
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,750
He was murdered.

322
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,160
This is serious.

323
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,510
Why didn't you mention it
over the phone?

324
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:53,480
I didn't want to scare you.

325
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,400
How was he murdered?

326
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,310
How?

327
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,550
Just like last time.

328
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,880
Suddenly,

329
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,160
the body fell out of the furnace.

330
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,750
Sir, I'm here to change the bed sheet.

331
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,160
I'll do it myself.

332
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,750
Isn't this Cheng Chun's phone book?

333
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,160
Yes.

334
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:27,310
This number belongs to someone
from the provincial city.

335
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,510
Back then, we focused all our attention

336
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:29,960
on Ding Baoyuan,

337
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,510
and didn't follow up on this number.

338
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,310
What's this?

339
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,920
This is Liu Dazhi's university roster.

340
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,960
He majored in finance, class of 2002.

341
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,030
The names and numbers match up.

342
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:49,550
His tuition for one semester
was 3,600 yuan.

343
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,200
I get it now.

344
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,110
If Cheng Chun's bank card

345
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,480
was in Liu Dazhi's possession,

346
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,920
it explains

347
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,200
why the withdrawals were made
in the provincial city,

348
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:06,640
and the amounts and times
of the withdrawals

349
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,590
were consistent.

350
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,200
He was using the money for tuition.

351
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,160
You mean Liu Dazhi could be involved?

352
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:19,200
We suspected Wang Liang
might be involved,

353
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,160
so we thought

354
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:23,880
Wang Liang committed the crime.

355
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,480
Liu Sancheng knew about it,

356
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,750
so Wang Liang killed Liu Sancheng.

357
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,830
But what if we reverse the logic?

358
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:36,270
Liu Sancheng was involved,
and Wang Liang knew.

359
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:39,110
Why would Liu Sancheng kill Cheng Chun?

360
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,070
What if Liu Sancheng didn't kill her?

361
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,680
What if he just helped dispose
of the body?

362
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:49,350
Liu Sancheng was timid, cowardly,
and afraid of trouble.

363
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:52,640
What could have pushed him

364
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,590
to take such a risk?

365
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,200
To protect his children.

366
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:04,880
Based on your logic,

367
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,070
if Liu Dazhi killed Cheng Chun,

368
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,160
and Liu Sancheng helped with the body,

369
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,200
and Wang Liang knew,

370
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,110
then why would Wang Liang help them?

371
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,720
They're like family.

372
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,590
When we were solving the case,

373
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:20,000
Wang Liang was still
Liu Sancheng's apprentice.

374
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,200
After the case closed,
he became their godson.

375
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:26,240
But he moved out of Liu Sancheng's house

376
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:27,750
Not long after that,

377
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,310
Liu Yingying graduated and returned.

378
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,720
And not long after, she had a child.

379
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,480
Wang Liang and Liu Yingying got married?

380
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,510
They didn't officially register.

381
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,880
Wang Liang blackmailed Liu Sancheng.

382
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,160
How did he blackmail Liu Sancheng?

383
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,880
Liu Sancheng is someone

384
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:54,000
who takes pride
in his children's success.

385
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,550
Would he give his daughter,

386
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,510
a junior college graduate
and a nurse at a hospital,

387
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,350
to a drifter from the pastoral area,
a boiler worker

388
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,160
like Wang Liang?

389
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,270
How did you come up with that?

390
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,030
After confirming that Wang Liang
is Duoduo's biological father,

391
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,790
I went to visit
Liu Yingying's grandmother.

392
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:27,680
Her grandmother said,

393
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,350
after Liu Yingying gave birth,

394
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,920
she sent Duoduo,
who wasn't even a month old,

395
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,240
to live with her.

396
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,550
She only took Duoduo back
when she was diagnosed with leukemia.

397
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:39,160
I initially thought Liu Yingying
preferred boys over girls,

398
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,960
but that wasn't the case.

399
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,960
Her grandmother said Liu Yingying

400
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,000
was ashamed of her own child.

401
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,160
She never touched her
when she was little.

402
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:52,350
Why did she despise her own child?

403
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,750
Because Duoduo's biological father
is Wang Liang.

404
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,200
That's not right.

405
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,240
If that's the case,

406
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:07,880
Liu Yingying should hate Wang Liang.

407
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,590
How could she possibly team up with him

408
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,960
to kill Liu Sancheng?

409
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,640
Good question.

410
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,480
That's something I still can't explain.

411
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,640
The case happened eight years ago.

412
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:28,310
All the traces are lost to time.

413
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:34,310
We also don't have
direct evidence proving

414
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,750
that Liu Dazhi is the murderer.

415
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:40,550
So keep investigating.

416
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:44,640
As long as there was a connection
between Liu Dazhi and Cheng Chun,

417
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,550
someone must know.

418
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,750
We just need to find that person.

419
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:52,480
Okay.

420
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,960
So who did it, really?

421
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,920
Why did they do it? Do we know yet?

422
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:05,510
No idea yet, the police
are still investigating.

423
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,510
Look,

424
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,510
I really can't

425
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:22,750
take time off from work.

426
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:25,350
You understand the situation, right?

427
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,480
Look,

428
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,310
I'll transfer some more money
to you, okay?

429
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,550
You take care of Dad's funeral. Alright?

430
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,550
I don't want money.

431
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,350
Then, what do you want?

432
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,550
I want you to be here with me.

433
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:37,920
I'm scared too.

434
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,510
You need to stay with me.

435
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,640
No, Sis,

436
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,110
I really can't stay.

437
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,270
How much do you want?

438
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,720
I can send more when I get back.

439
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,680
Dazhi,

440
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,440
have you thought about it?

441
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,550
Dad died so suddenly.

442
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,680
The police are investigating thoroughly,

443
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,110
and they're digging up the events
from back then too.

444
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,750
If you're not here right now,

445
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,440
they're definitely going to suspect you.

446
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,680
Since you're already back,

447
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,640
you might as well stay a few days.

448
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,350
The police might reach a conclusion

449
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,590
in a few days.

450
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,070
You're the only man left in the family.

451
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,960
Handle everything properly
before you leave.

452
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:27,960
Sis…

453
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,030
Who did it?

454
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,640
I told you, I don't know.

455
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:44,200
I read online that

456
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,750
Ding Baoyuan was released

457
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,240
due to a wrongful conviction.

458
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:49,920
No.

459
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:53,750
On the day Dad died,

460
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:55,310
he hadn't been released yet.

461
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,640
Duoduo's funeral is the day
after tomorrow.

462
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:18,240
I hope you'll attend.

463
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,240
But Sis,

464
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,030
Duoduo has been gone for so many days,

465
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,070
why hasn't the funeral happened yet?

466
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,640
We were waiting for her uncle.

467
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,790
What? You're waiting for me
to begin the funeral?

468
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:36,310
Do I really need to be there?

469
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,480
You're unbelievable.

470
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,790
Is Duoduo

471
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,640
that insignificant to you?

472
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,920
No.

473
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:46,790
What I'm trying to say is, does it
really matter if I'm there?

474
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,000
You're still young.

475
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,110
You can have more children.

476
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,110
So she is insignificant to you.

477
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,830
I tried to bring her to you

478
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,240
to go to the hospital for a match,

479
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,270
but you refused.

480
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,310
I was busy, remember?

481
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,790
I had multiple big projects going on.

482
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,680
I wished I could split
one day into three.

483
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:15,480
Sis,

484
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:17,880
that project was really important to me.

485
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,030
Didn't I tell you?

486
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,000
A deputy head position
in the credit department

487
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,110
is more important than Duoduo's life?

488
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,240
Didn't I

489
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:32,160
give you 20,000 yuan?

490
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:36,750
20,000 yuan

491
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,790
to buy yourself some peace of mind?

492
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,240
What do you mean by that?

493
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:50,160
What exactly are you trying to say?

494
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,790
Duoduo's burial is the day
after tomorrow.

495
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:53,350
Don't forget.

496
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:58,110
But...

497
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,030
What about Dad's situation?

498
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,400
If the police can't solve the case,

499
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,790
they won't return the body to us, right?

500
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,270
What do we do about the funeral then?

501
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,480
Luo,

502
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,480
Liu Sancheng's family is here.

503
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:39,150
Hello, I'm Liu Dazhi.

504
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,630
Liu Sancheng was my father.

505
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:41,230
Hello.

506
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:43,190
I'm the officer in charge
of your father's case.

507
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,000
My name is Luo Yingwei.

508
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,230
Dayong, get a chair.

509
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,880
Let's sit down and talk.

510
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:50,880
Officer,

511
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,590
it's been some time
since my father passed away.

512
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,920
I came to ask

513
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,000
if the body could be

514
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,360
returned to us soon,

515
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,280
so we can proceed
with the funeral arrangements.

516
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,630
The case is still ongoing,

517
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,840
so you can't collect the body yet.

518
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,920
The thing is, my job is really busy,

519
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,030
and I can't stay here for long.

520
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,840
Chen, Liu Sancheng's family is here.

521
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Liu Dazhi?

522
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,110
We've met before.

523
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,110
Eight years ago, I visited your house.

524
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:24,150
At that time, you were home
for winter break, right?

525
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,000
Do you remember now?

526
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,920
Back then, I was focused
solely on my studies.

527
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:31,840
I didn't pay much attention
to other things.

528
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,710
Mr. Liu was remarkable,

529
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,000
raising two college graduates.

530
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,110
A pride of Kulu.

531
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:38,920
Indeed.

532
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,110
He wants to collect the body.

533
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:40,920
Have you explained it to him?

534
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,670
Yes, I have.

535
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,480
It's just that my job is really busy,

536
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,400
so I can't stay here for too long.

537
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:54,550
How exactly did my father die?

538
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:56,630
The case is still being solved.

539
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,110
Are you certain it's a criminal case?

540
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,190
Is there no other possibility?

541
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,000
Any clues you'd like to tell us?

542
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,230
Well,

543
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,400
in recent years,
my father's mental state

544
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,280
hasn't been great.

545
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:19,550
How so?

546
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,400
After my mother passed away,

547
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,190
he became a bit

548
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:27,000
pessimistic and world-weary.

549
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,920
You mean he had depression?

550
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,550
Yes.

551
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,630
Depression.

552
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,110
So, it's possible he committed suicide.

553
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,710
That's a new theory.

554
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,230
Suicide, huh?

555
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:48,880
Suicide?

556
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,440
In the furnace room?

557
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,360
You should be familiar
with that furnace.

558
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,710
You spent your childhood there,
didn't you?

559
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,840
The furnace opening is only so big,

560
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,670
and you say it was suicide?

561
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:00,400
How would someone even get in

562
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:00,710
I...

563
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,670
to commit suicide?

564
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:02,190
I don't know.

565
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,510
He was stuffed in, it was murder.

566
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:05,400
It's just a guess.

567
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,920
Of course, if it is a criminal case,

568
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:12,320
I would want the killer caught
as soon as possible.

569
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:14,280
Catching the killer is our job,

570
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:16,070
but the family needs to cooperate.

571
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,360
Since

572
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:23,110
I can't take the body,

573
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,000
I'll just leave it with you guys
for now.

574
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,190
I'll head back to the provincial city.

575
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,230
Can't be away for too long.

576
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,000
I have a suggestion.

577
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:33,190
Why don't you

578
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,480
stay for a few more days?

579
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,840
See your father off,

580
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,150
fulfill your duty.

581
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,920
Don't let the neighbors

582
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,440
gossip.

583
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:52,920
I'll make a call to my workplace

584
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,230
and discuss it with them.

585
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,280
Right, discuss it.

586
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,030
You must be busy.

587
00:37:58,590 --> 00:37:59,190
I'll head out first.

588
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:02,840
Liu Dafu.

589
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:08,110
Officer, it's Liu Dazhi.

590
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,360
I've even changed my ID.

591
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,960
Do you know Cheng Chun?

592
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,400
Which Cheng Chun?

593
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:17,150
The one from our area,

594
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:19,150
who had a stall at the Wuxing Market,

595
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,760
known for her delicious seitan.

596
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:24,440
Sounds familiar.

597
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:27,150
Didn't they find her body

598
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,630
in a furnace?

599
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:33,320
Goodbye.

600
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,510
Sorry.

601
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:11,190
Sorry.

602
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,440
Do you know Cheng Chun?

608
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,360
You forgot to close the door.

609
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:20,230
I noticed you didn't lock the door.

610
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:52,000
Will you be good to me?

611
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:55,920
I will.

612
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:58,960
I'll be good to you.

613
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,670

614
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:06,510

You're capable.

633

I've had enough of this place.

If you're willing,

Up ahead,

that's where Cheng Chun
used to set up her stall.

638
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,070
What did she sell back then?

639
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:50,400
Spicy hotpot, seitan.

640
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,000
Her seitan was pretty good.

641
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:53,840
She brought you food twice.

What do you have?

647
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,190
We've got stir-fries, noodles,
lamb vermicelli.

648
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:07,670
Lamb vermicelli then.

649

Sure, two bowls of lamb vermicelli.

652
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,030
Got it.

653
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:17,880
That room over there,

654
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:20,590
that's where Cheng Chun
did business back then.

655
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:25,070
Madam, there are no empty tables.

Yes.

Which university do you want to go to?

664
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,440
Beijing University.

665
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:06,110
Ambitious.

For the kids around here,

671
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:25,670
university is the only way

672
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:28,110
out of this place.

673
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,840
Liu Dazhi did it.

674
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,480
He started school two years late.

675
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:34,630
But he's smart

676
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:35,920
and got into university smoothly.

677
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:36,840
That's impressive.

Yes, as in your name.

686
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,710
There should be a hook
under the moon character.

687
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,070
A vertical hook.

688
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:43,030
Like this.

the tuition fees are not cheap.

you investigated Liu Sancheng's family.

735
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,880

was also in Kulu.

That's right.

738
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,880
He usually went in around 8 PM

739
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:41,320
and came out around 4 or 5 AM.

740
00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:43,190
But the case files didn't mention

741
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:44,880
what time he left on the night
of the incident.

742
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,960

00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,590
he spent all his time
in the internet cafe

748
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,550
and avoided Cheng Chun.

749
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:20,030
But we still don't have any evidence.

750
00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:22,000
Take it easy.

751
00:53:22,590 --> 00:53:24,800
Now that Liu Dazhi
is stuck here with us,

752
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:25,960
given enough time,

753
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:27,630
he's bound to slip up.

754
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:52,510
Fu.

755
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:02,920
Fu, is that you?

756
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,280
I'm Liu Dazhi.

757
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:06,670
Do we know each other?

758
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,550
It's me, Zhang Fan.

759
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:10,190
We used to hang out at the internet cafe

760
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:11,920
during your semester breaks.

761
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,320
Did you forget?

762
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:15,510
You...

763
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:18,030
Are you back because of Mr. Liu?

764
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:19,880
Yes.

765
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:22,400
My condolences.

766
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:25,280
Are you in charge here?

767
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:28,590
It's a family business.

768
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:30,480
Got it.

769
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:32,710
What's wrong?

770
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,150
What's up?

771
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:39,360
Here's the thing,

772
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,110
my father passed away recently,

773
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,670
so I have to stay here
for a few more days.

774
00:54:44,070 --> 00:54:46,030
I want you to ensure my safety.

775
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:48,190
Ensure your safety?

776
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:49,480
What do you mean?

777
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:54,070
My dad died suspiciously.

778
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:55,960
I'm worried.

779
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,150
Yeah, true.

780
00:54:58,710 --> 00:55:00,630
Mr. Liu was an honest man.

781
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:02,840
How could such a thing happen?

782
00:55:04,070 --> 00:55:04,880
My condolences.

783
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:07,800
To ensure my safety,

784
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:08,800
I need you to arrange a room

785
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,150
that faces the security camera.

786
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:11,760
If there isn't one,

787
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:13,510
install it just for me.

788
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:18,480
Is that really necessary?

789
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,150
This is a five-star hotel,

790
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:21,230
it's very safe.

791
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:24,000
It's necessary.

792
00:55:25,070 --> 00:55:26,630
I'll cover all the costs.

793
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:30,070
This isn't about the money.

794
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:32,800
Manager Yang.

795
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:34,070
Manager Yang.

796
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:35,000
Boss.

797
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:42,280
This room

798
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:44,110
is the best suite in our hotel.

799
00:55:45,590 --> 00:55:47,440
Only top provincial leaders stay here.

800
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:49,110
Mr. Liu, this way.

801
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,590
Take a look inside.

802
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,630
The seventh floor is absolutely safe.

803
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:57,840
Solid wood.

804
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:02,480
The mattress is from Simmons,
it's super comfortable.

805
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:08,710
Mr. Liu, what are you looking for?

806
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:10,840
Nothing.

807
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:14,110
Alright, if there's nothing else,
take a rest.

808
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,280
If you need anything, just call
the front desk and ask for me.

809
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:16,880
Alright.

810
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,400
Have a good rest.

811
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,110
Thank you, Manager Yang.

812
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:20,710
No problem, let's have a drink sometime.

813
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,150
Dafu.

814
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:22,280
Take me with you.
