Body temperature is normal.

00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,240
This child is so cute.

4
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,710
Look at his round face.

5
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,520
Have you given him a name?

6
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,310
Not yet.

7
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,200
Duoduo.

8
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,310
Liu Duoduo.

9
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,150
Are you not the child's father?

10
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,310
He is the child's uncle.

11
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,760
Duoduo.

12
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:30,480
You have a name now.

President Yang!

15
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:06,590
It has been so long.

16
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,190
It has been so long.

[Vitality, Energy, Spirit]
You changed the words.

18
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,430
I didn't.

19
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,960
Where's "Live Like Water"?

20
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,120
It has always been these three words.
"Vitality, Energy, Spirit".

21
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,520
Did I remember it wrongly?

22
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,080
You are in good spirits.

23
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,030
Is that so?

24
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:21,710
What is it?

25
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,150
Let me ask you two things.

26
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,710
Is Liu Yingying
a nurse from your hospital?

27
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,520
When did she come to the hospital?

28
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,240
The year she came

29
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,710
was when I got promoted
to assistant director.

30
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,430
It has been seven years I guess.

31
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:36,590
She came here

32
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,150
to become a nurse
as soon as she graduated.

33
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,910
Had she given birth when she came here?

34
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,430
She had not given birth
when she came here

35
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,360
but not long after...

36
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,630
She gave birth to Duoduo

37
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,680
after seven or eight months.

38
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,910
You remember so clearly.

39
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,400
What do you mean?

40
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,560
Are you close to Wang Liang?

41
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,310
Yes.

42
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:01,120
He is the manager
of our county's heating station.

43
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,080
He often visits Duoduo at the hospital.

44
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,630
What is his relationship
with Liu Yingying?

45
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,310
What is their relationship?

46
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,360
Isn't he Liu's foster son

47
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,120
and Duoduo's step-uncle?

48
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,680
Everyone out there is saying

49
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,510
that the relationship

50
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,870
between Wang Liang,
Liu Sancheng and Liu Yingying

51
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,120
are quite complicated.

52
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,510
Have you heard about it?

53
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,310
This is...

54
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,040
The rumours might be so

55
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,120
but this is their family matters.

56
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,190
I'll put it this way.

57
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,920
I can guarantee

58
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,040
that Liu is righteous

59
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,920
when it comes to living his life.

60
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,430
Let me ask you
something about your profession.

61
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,560
Can you match one's bone marrow

62
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,070
when two people aren't related by blood?

63
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,270
The chances are very slim.

64
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,270
How slim?

65
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,120
One in a few hundred thousand.

66
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,510
One in a few hundred thousand?

67
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,310
I heard

68
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,070
Wang Liang
begged the hospital many times

69
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,800
to do
the bone marrow matching examination.

70
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,600
What's going on with that?

71
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,720
I'm not so sure about this.

72
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,920
You can ask

73
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,040
Duoduo's attending doctor, Dr. Wu.

74
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,720
However, I think it's understandable.

75
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,920
The child is still young.

76
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,070
Manager Wang is only
feeling anxious for the child.

77
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,040
I have no more questions.

78
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,870
All right. I'm leaving.

79
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,070
All right.

80
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,120
Let's have a meal together next time.

81
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,040
Keep your promise.

82
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,240
Take care.

We only want pigs!

85
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,720
We don't want geese or chickens!

86
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,600
Come.

87
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,310
Hey! We don't want those.

88
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,750
We only want pigs.

89
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,750
We brought them all.

90
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,600
We only want pigs.

91
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:56,600
That won't do.

92
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,120
Line up.

93
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,510
No! We only want pigs! Everyone!

94
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,870
It must not weigh
more or less than 500 grams.

95
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,680
Next is that.

96
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,510
That one over there.

97
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,160
That one!

98
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,950
The one at the back! Come over.

99
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,360
Are you changing your lives?

100
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,480
Chen, what do you mean?

101
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,480
Zhang, keep a close eye on them.

102
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,310
I want to do a time-based experiment.

103
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,680
From a technical point of view,

104
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,920
I want to determine if Cheng Chun's body

105
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,950
was stuffed inside by Ding Baoyuan.

106
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,830
Look.

107
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,510
Coal enters from this coal inlet

108
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:44,830
and turns into slag

109
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,040
and exit from this slag outlet.

110
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,190
This process

111
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,160
takes around an hour and 45 minutes.

112
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,600
However, if you stuff something

113
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,510
from the slag outlet

114
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,920
and go through the process

115
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,630
before exiting the outlet,

116
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,510
the journey takes longer than the coal

117
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,950
which means the time has been doubled

118
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,630
and becomes three and a half hours.

119
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,480
However, I read

120
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,070
the judgement back then

121
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,390
which states Ding Baoyuan
stuffed the body

122
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,390
at 11 at night

123
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,630
before it fell out at 5 in the morning.

124
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,600
There were five hours in between.

125
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,720
The time didn't match.

126
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,190
The consideration was
that the body was put inside as a whole

127
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,360
but coal is separated.

128
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,240
So,

129
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,830
I checked Cheng Chun's medical records.

130
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,360
Her weight was around 50 kilograms.

131
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,360
If we find a body

132
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,310
that weighs similar to Cheng Chun

133
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,560
and stuff it from the slag outlet

134
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,830
before we see how long it takes
for it to come out,

135
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,830
we will be able

136
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,310
to see if Ding Baoyuan

137
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,800
was the one who stuffed
Cheng Chun's body.

138
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,000
Don't laugh.

139
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,120
Are you finding a pig?

140
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,310
That's...

141
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,750
You need a dead pig
that weighs 50 kilograms.

142
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,560
You must find a live pig
that weighs 60 kilograms at least.

143
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,510
60 kilograms?

144
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,750
You need to let out its blood first.

145
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,040
Chen, you are smart.

146
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,480
Zhang, change of plans.

147
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,830
We are now looking for
pigs that weigh 60 kilograms.

148
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,920
Not 50 kilograms anymore.

149
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,830
Recall all those pigs.

150
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,920
Quick! Call them back.

151
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,630
Hey!

152
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,800
Hey!

153
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,600
Come back first!

154
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,390
How much does it weigh?

155
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,480
This is 65 kilograms.

156
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,240
65 kilograms?

157
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,270
I have one smaller than this.

158
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,040
I remember I have one.

159
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,430
Call that man back! Hurry!

160
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,120
Hey!

161
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:50,630
Hello.

162
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,320
I just came back
from the Civil Affairs Bureau.

163
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,550
It has been verified.

164
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,870
Wang Liang and Liu Yingying
have no marriage records.

165
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:57,720
Got it.

166
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,270
Where are you going?

167
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:01,720
Mr. Chen.

168
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,480
Where is your motorbike?

169
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:04,960
It broke down.

170
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,720
Get in. Quick! Put it at the back!

171
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:28,910
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

172
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,720
Has your child's funeral taken place?

173
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,550
Not yet. It'll take three more days.

174
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,360
What a pity for Duoduo.

175
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,870
Children of people like us

176
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,510
came and left.

177
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,720
It felt as if he were never here.

178
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,840
Duoduo felt love in the human world.

179
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,910
How could you say
that he had not been here before?

180
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,720
Stop talking about him.

181
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,550
Duoduo was so pitiful.

182
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,960
I've been working in Luoche
for almost eight years.

183
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,720
I've met many people
and heard many stories.

184
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,720
Let me tell you a story

185
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,320
to pass the time.

186
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,240
Many years ago,

187
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,720
a girl came here.

188
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,200
Her name and age

189
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,630
was unknown.

190
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,360
Her place of origin was unknown as well.

191
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,720
Here. Let me toast everyone.

192
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,870
Give birth to a son soon.

193
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,510
Thank you. It must be a son.

194
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:08,720
Drink more.

195
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,120
Come! Drink!

196
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:16,720
What are you looking at?

197
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:17,960
Go away!

198
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,270
Not even a peek!

199
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,320
Go and drink!

200
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,320
Where are you going?

201
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,440
Let go!

202
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,510
If you run away,
who will give birth to my son?

203
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:32,910
Let go!

204
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,030
Go away!

205
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,630
You are quite a vicious woman.

206
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,600
How dare you beat me.

207
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,320
Let go!

208
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,000
Did I ask you to beat me?

209
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,440
Has he eaten?

210
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,150
Look. Does he look like you?

211
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,510
Yes.

212
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,240
He resembles you.

213
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,320
He is my son.
Of course, he resembles me.

214
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,080
Old Man.

215
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,270
Baoshan! Hurry! They are over there!

216
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,480
Baoshan!

217
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,120
They didn't treat her well
even after the child was born.

218
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,910
Every time she escaped,

219
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,320
she was captured.

220
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:53,000
She would receive domestic violence

221
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,510
that was more vicious.

222
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,720
Where's your conscience?

223
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,080
How dare you waste my food!

224
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,000
I'll beat you to death!

225
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,720
How dare you waste my food!

I'll beat you to death!

228
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,630
How dare you waste my food!

229
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:53,630
Baoshan! Your wife is beating me!

230
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,550
I will beat you to death!

231
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,030
Coming!

232
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,670

233

Baoshan!

234

How dare you beat my mother.

235
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,550
Beat her to death.

236
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:06,750
How dare you beat my mother.

237
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:07,510
How dare you fight back!

238
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,400
Wench!

239
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,480
I raised you for nothing.

240
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,440
-How dare you fight back?
-Beat her to death.

241
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,160
Who asked you to fight back?

242
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:13,720
Beat her to death.

243
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,480
How dare you fight back!

244
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,240
How dare you beat me!

245
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,030
Get up!

246
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,640
Mom, are there really
tall buildings out there?

247
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,880
Mom. Will Grandpa
and Granny really like me?

248
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:33,720
Mom. Why didn't you bring Dad along?

Where are you going?

251
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,160
You will never escape this place.
Do you understand?

252
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,160
When we go home later,

253
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,830
I will break both your legs!

254
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Mom, does it hurt?

255
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,750
When everyone thought
she surrendered to fate,

00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,310

Chen's theory of a 60-kilogram pig

342

its blood released was wrong.

00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,070
Hurry!

377
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:04,960
Hurry up!

378
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,440
Sorry.

379
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,030
Wang!

380
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,960
I had a drink yesterday.

381
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,640
Sorry. I forgot to inform them.

382
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,680
You are so unreliable.

383
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:15,830
Let me arrange it.

384
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:16,510
What's going on?

385
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,200
I've been knocking

386
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,640
but I don't know
what's happening inside.

387
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,070
Keep knocking.

388
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:23,830
Wang!

389
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,590
Harder!

390
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,030
Erbao!

391
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,030
Coming.

392
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,350
Why are you knocking?

393
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,270
Are you not going
to let me sleep in the morning?

394
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,240
What's wrong with you?

395
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,640
Do you know what time it is?
It's time to change shifts.

396
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,920
Commissioner Liu, get in.

397
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,160
Wang Liang!

398
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,270
Wang Liang!

399
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,680
What's going on today?

400
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,480
Let's go to the office.

401
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,680
You're still sleeping.

402
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,160
You're lying down after a while.

403
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,240
Do you want to get fired?

404
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,400
Do you think this is your home?

405
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,400
Do you know what time it is?

406
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,240
Director, how did you get inside?

407
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,720
Where's your manager? Call him!

408
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,590
The manager...

409
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,590
I'll call him.

410
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,200
How is our station's discipline upheld?

411
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,510
I think your punishment is too lenient.

412
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:54,070
Director Yu.

413
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,030
You're still sleeping
at a time like this?

414
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:55,960
Director Yu.

415
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:57,400
Yu.

416
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,440
Let's get down to business.

417
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,590
Is that car from your station?

418
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,640
Yes.

419
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,550
This is a car for unloading coal.

420
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,310
It's time to unload coal now.

421
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,440
Do you think they can unload coal now?

422
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,030
Luo.

423
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,640
Will it affect your experiment?

424
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:16,510
There are ten more minutes.
Get it done as soon as possible.

425
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,200
Manager!

426
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:49,160
Open the door, Manager!

427
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,680
Manager!

428
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,440
Director Yu is here!

429
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,680
Manager!

430
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,200
Manager!

431
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,200
What is it?

432
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:03,720
Director Yu.

433
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,240
Who's here?

434
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,510
Director Yu is here.

435
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,110
He brought many police officers.

436
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:13,960
Hurry up!

437
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:34,550
What time is it, Wang?

438
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,440
I don't know.

439
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,440
Have they come to change shifts?

440
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,270
I think they have.

441
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,440
Has Wang Liang come out?

442
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:50,750
Director Yu. Mr. Chen. Luo.

443
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,110
What is the meaning of this?

444
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,200
What's wrong with you today?

445
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,480
It's nothing serious.

446
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:04,440
The government is very responsible

447
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,480
and is going to investigate
a case from the past

448
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,680
by carrying out an experiment.

449
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:11,350
Commissioner Liu, how can we

450
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,480
work with you in this experiment?

451
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,030
It's easy. Just like in the past.

452
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,240
We will put a pig that weighs
the same as Cheng Chun

453
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,030
into the furnace

454
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,440
and see how long it takes
for it to fall.

455
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:24,440
Everyone. Please come inside.

456
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,240
Erbao.

457
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:27,440
Push the pig over here!

458
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,240
Come on. Help me to bring it out.

459
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,200
All right.

460
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,030
Come on.

461
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:47,200
Here.

462
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,680
Wang Liang, open the slag box.

463
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,070
Erbao. Wang.

464
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,550
Open the slag box.

465
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,270
Sure.

466
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,720
Be careful.

467
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,240
Shouldn't you clean the slag
at five in the morning?

468
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,070
Why is there so much?

469
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,030
Sorry, Director.

470
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,550
I slept too late.

471
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:20,680
I only remember to load the coal
and forgot to clean the slag.

472
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,640
Director Yu. It's all my fault.

473
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,880
When I woke up this morning,

474
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,070
I saw all of them sleeping.

475
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,640
I asked them to load the coal
but forgot to clean the slag.

476
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,680
Sorry.

477
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,400
Forget it.
It'll be 7:30 AM soon.

478
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,680
Clean the furnace quickly

479
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,590
and put the pig inside.

480
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:33,200
All right.

481
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,350
Everyone. Follow me
to the office to take a break.

482
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,680
Zhang. Li. Keep a close eye on it.

483
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,440
It must be placed on the conveyor belt.

484
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,070
All right. I understand.

485
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,310
This coal is not bad.

486
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:56,110
We just found this source.

487
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,680
It's tough being here.

488
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,510
Your shift hours are long too.

489
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:02,750
I heard a season...

490
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,550
Not a season. Two seasons...

491
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,070
Director.

492
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:07,070
Give it to the Commissioner.

493
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,150
Commissioner Liu.

494
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,280
You're welcome.

495
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:11,800
Mr. Chen.

496
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,920
Have some tea.

497
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,840
The pig was put inside at 7:45 AM.

498
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,630
I'm not drinking.

499
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,920
Check on it after half an hour.

500
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,710
Ms. Luo.

501
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,000
No need. Thank you.

502
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,230
Go inside and take a look
after half an hour.

503
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,670
Oh. Mr. Chen.

504
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,840
Do you know a flower called Mandrake?

505
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,360
Officer!

506
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:36,590
It fell!

507
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,070
Didn't we just place it inside?

508
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,030
It's not a pig!

509
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,230
Manager Wang, stop the furnace.

510
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,230
Secure the perimeter.

511
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:57,960
Yes.

512
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,800
Should we stop the furnace?

513
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,400
The town's heating

514
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,920
is depending on this furnace.

515
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,960
We can't bear this responsibility.

516
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:10,840
In the case eight years ago,

517
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,550
we investigated the furnace too.

518
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:13,710
The temperature was too high

519
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,280
and we couldn't find anything.

520
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:17,880
Let's not stop the furnace first.

521
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,320
Protect the slag.

522
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,440
We'll clean it up later.

523
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:22,880
Ma.

524
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,440
Bring everyone from the heating station

525
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,480
to that room over there.

526
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,030
Yes.

527
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,030
Director Yu. Manager Wang. Come with me.

528
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:28,710
Zhang,

529
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,280
contact the coroner.

530
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,000
Go and see if Liu Sancheng is around.

531
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:38,590
Yes.

532
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,630
One fell eight years ago.

533
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,150
Now, another one fell.

534
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,110
Even the modus operandi is the same.

535
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,030
Do you still think

536
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:56,280
it was Ding Baoyuan
who committed the previous case?

537
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,510
The two cases should be related.

538
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,230
Combine the cases

539
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,480
and set up a task force.

540
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:10,070
I'll be the team leader.

541
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,590
Both of you will be vice team leaders.

542
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:15,440
Use every member
of the police force to crack this case.

543
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:17,880
If this case goes public,
it will blow up.

544
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,510
When I go back to the station,

545
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,070
I'll write a report
to request a punishment.

546
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,030
Get it dealt with as soon as possible.

547
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:37,590
Get it dealt with?

548
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:44,760
You can wait here for the pig to fall.

549
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,280
How do you work as a manager?

550
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,360
Why did another body fall down?

551
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,880
What is your duty?

552
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,320
You two as well.

553
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,070
How dare you vomit.

554
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,550
Look at you
three pieces of useless trash.

555
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,030
Director Yu. Are you in a meeting?

556
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,440
It's nothing. Just a casual chat.

557
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,630
Continue.

558
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,880
Please continue.

559
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,190
Go ahead.

560
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,000
Do you still feel disgusting?

561
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:34,230
Have some hot water. Quick.

562
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,440
How old?

563
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,230
23.

564
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,960
I'm sure
you have nothing in your stomach now.

565
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,030
I vomited in the pile of slag.

566
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,960
Only my bile is left.

567
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,960
Everyone. Wait for a while.

568
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,760
Our colleague will be here

569
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,960
to investigate the scene.

570
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:18,920
Officer Luo.

571
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,280
Luo.

572
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,880
When did you
begin your night shift last night?

573
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:44,590
We started
at seven in the evening last night.

574
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:46,190
Our shift starts at seven

575
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:47,510
but we are required

576
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,150
to arrive at 6:40 PM.

577
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:52,800
to change shifts
and do some safety checks.

578
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:55,920
Usually, our shift begins
from seven in the evening

579
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,030
to seven in the morning the next day.

580
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:58,670
Yes.

581
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:02,110
Director Yu. A shift here is 12 hours?

582
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,440
Yes.

583
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:05,030
Didn't you see

584
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,440
that we have
an automatic coal loading machine?

585
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,030
I did.

586
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,000
As long as you fill
the loading machine with coal,

587
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,760
you can ignore it for five hours

588
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,840
and it will load the coal automatically.

589
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:16,440
That is why we changed
three shifts into two shifts.

590
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:19,920
After every two shifts,

591
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,840
our workers can rest for a whole day.

592
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:25,110
This is all thanks to Manager Wang Liang

593
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:27,230
for obtaining the coal loading machine.

594
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,880
The manager is great.

595
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,000
When did you return to the station?

596
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:37,400
I went to the hospital at 6:30 PM.

597
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,400
Yingying was feeling unwell.

598
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:42,070
I returned to the station
at around 10:30 PM.

599
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,630
After Manager Wang came back,

600
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,070
we filled the coal loading machine

601
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:49,320
and it was almost 10:30 PM.

602
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:52,590
Then, the three of us had supper.

603
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:54,760
Who bought the supper?

604
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,760
Me.

605
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,760
What did you buy?

606
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,000
A roasted chicken
and half a bag of pig's head.

607
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,510
Do you usually have supper?

608
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:12,400
We eat supper usually

609
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,630
but the station doesn't provide it.

610
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:16,880
We need to buy it ourselves.

611
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,360
Yes.

612
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,840
Manager Wang is a nice person.

613
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:21,440
He will bring us supper

614
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,150
from time to time.

615
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:24,280
We will eat together.

616
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,630
You work hard after eating, right?

617
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:28,280
He is bribing you.

618
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:29,670
What do you think?

619
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:33,150
Didn't you drink?

620
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,590
We drank.

621
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:40,320
We drank
three to four bottles of beer each.

622
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,920
We even finished a bottle of liquor.

623
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,630
Do you only know how to drink?

624
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,110
You don't even know

625
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:49,030
after something so serious happened.

626
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,510
Why do we need you for?

627
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,510
I don't care whose idea is this.

628
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,880
Your bonus this year will be deducted.

629
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,030
Actually,

630
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:58,440
Our usual management is quite strict.

631
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:01,550
Safe production.

632
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,550
Didn't you say anything
after drinking the whole night?

633
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,000
Not at all.

634
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,030
Something happened
to Manager Wang's family

635
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:25,630
so we were consoling him.

636
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,030
That was all.

637
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:29,150
There was nothing else.

638
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:29,960
Yes.

639
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,070
You were talking about

640
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,030
a sad topic the whole night.

641
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,550
Since something so serious happened.

642
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:48,030
Did something special or different

643
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:51,000
happen last night?

644
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:52,880
I was sound asleep.

645
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,800
Me too.

646
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,230
I didn't even go to the toilet at night.

647
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:58,840
How many times do you
go to the toilet at night usually?

648
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:01,510
Him? Two to three times.

649
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:06,190
You have a prostate problem.

650
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,630
You need to get it checked.

651
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,510
What about you?

652
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:15,320
I was drunk as well.

653
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:17,760
I don't even remember
how I got back to my bed.

654
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:40,760
Liu Yingying called.

655
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:42,150
Liu Sancheng is missing.

656
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:44,150
I've asked Wei to go there first.

657
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,710
Question them separately.

658
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:55,760
Mr. Wang,

659
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,510
come with me.

660
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,030
When I was working in the morning,

661
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:36,190
I received a call from your side
looking for my father.

662
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,550
I was worried
so I came back to take a look.

663
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,230
In the end, I realised he wasn't home.

664
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:42,800
I think he didn't return last night.

665
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:45,110
Were you at the hospital
all the time last night?

666
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:47,710
I was working overtime last night.

667
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,480
Take a look at this.

668
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,840
Do you remember this card?

669
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:57,840
I don't.

670
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:00,230
It was found in your father's room.

671
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:01,400
Why do you not remember it?

672
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,670
I live outside
and don't come back frequently.

673
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:14,670
How many of you were eating that night?

674
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,840
Just the three of us.

675
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,110
Wang and I

676
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:21,920
arrive around 6:40 PM.

677
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,710
We ate half a roasted chicken
and some pig's head.

678
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:25,800
We had a drink as well.

679
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:26,880
What did you do in between?

680
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:29,230
When I came, I checked

681
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:31,440
the condition of the coal machine

682
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,960
and did safety checks.

683
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:35,070
I also exchanged shifts
with my colleagues.

684
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:35,880
Who bought the alcohol?

685
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,030
Our manager bought it.

686
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:37,880
Manager Wang?

687
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:41,070
Did you feel anything weird?

688
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:42,880
Not really.

689
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:45,840
I worked and got off work.

690
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,360
Ask someone to deal with the pig.

691
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,480
I've never seen anyone
appearing at his house.

692
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,360
Who are you?

693
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,230
Hello.

694
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:03,440
I don't know. I didn't pay attention.

695
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,480
Did any strangers around here

696
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:06,360
come to find him recently?

697
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:07,480
Strangers?

698
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,280
No.

699
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:12,840
I don't know.

700
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:13,710
Who did he offend?

701
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:14,710
Eight years ago,

702
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:16,230
there was a murder case
at the heating station.

703
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:32,550
After eight years,

704
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:35,840
two bodies fell from the same furnace.

705
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,480
Your experiment was great.

706
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:45,550
Great.

707
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:47,710
The funny thing

708
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:50,630
is that the police were the ones

709
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,320
who tampered with the scene.

710
00:46:55,070 --> 00:46:56,320
Isn't this embarrassing?

711
00:46:57,070 --> 00:46:57,920
Isn't this embarrassing?

712
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:10,630
Have you confirmed
the victim's identity?

713
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:13,230
The DNA test confirms

714
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:14,280
that the victim was Liu Sancheng.

715
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:17,630
Do you have an idea
of who the suspect is?

716
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,000
The prime suspect now is Wang Liang.

717
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:26,440
Chen.

718
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:29,230
Say something.

719
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:42,510
I must correct

720
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:44,840
my wrong judgment previously.

721
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,030
I kept emphasising

722
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:51,230
that Liu Sancheng and Wang Liang
wouldn't work together.

723
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:53,400
My reason was

724
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,630
that if they worked together,

725
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,960
Cheng Chun would be burned to ashes

726
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,800
as soon as she fell from the furnace.

727
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:11,710
I was wrong.

728
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:14,760
It was a wrong judgement.

729
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:29,440
I agree the prime suspect now

730
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,190
is Wang Liang.

731
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:33,440
Have you investigated Wang Liang?

732
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:35,840
Yes.

733
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,280
Wang Liang
worked the night shift yesterday.

734
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:40,030
He went to hike in the morning

735
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,150
and returned with Chen.

736
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,440
He went to the mason
after he came back.

737
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:45,760
I investigated it.

738
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:48,360
The mason said he was there
to ask about carving a headstone.

739
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:52,030
Around six in the evening, he went
to find Liu Yingying at the hospital.

740
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:54,000
Both of them were always together

741
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:55,360
until around nine at night.

742
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,000
Later, Wang Liang
went back to the heating station.

743
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:59,590
What's wrong?

744
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:02,440
Did you say both of them
stayed together from six

745
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:03,590
to nine in the evening?

746
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:04,440
Yes.

747
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,400
Investigate it again.

748
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,510
I want it accurate to the second.

749
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,000
Yes.

750
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:15,070
Commissioner Liu.

751
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:17,960
Chen. The result is out.

752
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:22,110
Wang Liang
is Duoduo's biological father.

753
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:24,190
Thank you.

754
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:25,150
Isn't he Duoduo's uncle?

755
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,230
Get investigating.

756
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:51,800
How did this happen?

757
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:54,190
Get to work.

758
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:56,110
Let's go.

759
00:49:56,110 --> 00:49:56,920
Let's investigate.

760
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:03,840
Chen, what are you doing?

761
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:04,630
I have something to do.

762
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,550
Oh. Investigate Liu Yingying.

763
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:07,630
When the case happened,

764
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:08,840
Liu Yingying wasn't in Kulu.

765
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:11,630
What are you going to investigate?

766
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:16,230
The truth
that I've neglected for all these years.

767
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:18,230
If we solve this case now,

768
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:20,150
we will know the truth
about the case from eight years ago.

769
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:23,510
Luo. You received a good education.

770
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:24,710
This is your advantage.

771
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,630
I need to learn from you.

772
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:31,280
This is
a typical acquaintance society here.

773
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,840
Even if it's an acquaintance society,

774
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,440
you can't crack a case through nonsense

775
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,630
but evidence instead.

776
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,030
Fine. Leave.

777
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:43,230
I will be in charge of the task force.

778
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,150
I'll work closely with you!

779
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,920
Why are you two still here?

780
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,000
Didn't I ask you
to investigate Wang Liang?

781
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,510
Go and see if there are other cameras

782
00:51:00,510 --> 00:51:01,400
that caught them.

783
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:02,480
Yes.

784
00:51:06,190 --> 00:51:07,630
Oh, right.

785
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:09,710
Check where Liu Yingying went as well.

786
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:10,510
Yes.

787
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,880
According to the experiment,

788
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,590
a body weighing 50 kilograms

789
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:28,440
takes four hours and seven minutes

790
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,360
to fall from the furnace
from the moment it was put inside.

791
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:31,880
It proves that

792
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:32,590
one,

793
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:35,190
Cheng Chun was
put inside at around 1 AM

794
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,710
and not 11 PM
as claimed by Ding Baoyuan

795
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:39,400
so Ding Baoyuan isn't the murderer.

796
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,230
The second point is about Liu Sancheng.

797
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:42,670
His body

798
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:45,030
fell at 7:47 AM.

799
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:47,280
That means his body was put inside

800
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,070
at 3:40 AM.

801
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:14,550
Granny.

802
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:17,070
Granny.

803
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:21,320
Jianghe?

804
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:23,550
You're here.

805
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:26,070
I've come here on official business

806
00:52:26,070 --> 00:52:27,480
and visit you at the same time.

807
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:30,070
This bank card belongs to Cheng Chun.

808
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:32,070
It was found in Liu Sancheng's house.

809
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:33,110
This proves

810
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:35,000
that Liu Sancheng
was involved in this case.

811
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
That means

812
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:39,510
the person who pretended to be a cripple
to mislead the police

813
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:40,710
was Liu Sancheng.

814
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,230
From the evidence we have now,
it is highly possible.

815
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,440
Why did he still keep this card

816
00:52:45,550 --> 00:52:47,030
after so many years?

817
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:48,510
Won't we discover it sooner or later?

818
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:50,880
Here's my opinion.

819
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:52,880
After Ding Baoyuan was arrested,

820
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,670
he thought the risk was lowered.

821
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:55,880
Yes. We investigated it.

822
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,190
The card had about 1,000 yuan left.

823
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:58,840
He was probably reluctant
to throw it away.

824
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:03,070
Who did Liu Sancheng contact
on the night of the crime?

825
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:04,030
Who did he interact with?

826
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,360
We investigated his phone log.

827
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:08,630
He didn't contact many people usually.

828
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:10,480
He would only call
his daughter, Liu Yingying.

829
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,630
He seldom contacted Wang Liang too.

830
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:14,110
On the night of the crime,

831
00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:15,630
the last two calls

832
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:17,000
were to these two people.

833
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:19,840
At 6:40 PM,

834
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,630
Liu Yingying made a 32-minute call

835
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:23,030
to Liu Sancheng.

836
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:24,320
At 7:34 PM,

837
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,190
Wang Liang also called Liu Sancheng.

838
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:28,320
The call duration
was six minutes and 37 seconds.

839
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:30,550
A while later,
at a bit after 8 PM,

840
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:32,190
Liu Sancheng went out

841
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:33,320
and went missing.

842
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,710
Granny. Have you met
Duoduo's father before?

843
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:48,480
Yingying said

844
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:51,960
Duoduo had no father.

845
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,400
Wang Liang is Duoduo's father.

846
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:06,630
Why would a family

847
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:08,110
become like this?

848
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,030
This is the camera footage

849
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:18,070
that captures Liu Sancheng.

850
00:54:19,110 --> 00:54:19,760
Stop.

851
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:23,320
He added a hood
at the back of his vehicle.

852
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:25,110
What was on there?

853
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:26,400
A doll?

854
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:27,280
Yes.

855
00:54:28,070 --> 00:54:30,800
Did he use this vehicle
to pick up his granddaughter?

856
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:32,630
Commissioner Liu, I investigated it.

857
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:34,230
Liu Sancheng's granddaughter, Duoduo,

858
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,070
has lived in her hometown
for a long time.

859
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,920
However, he had a son and a grandson

860
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:40,400
who lived in the county.

861
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:41,670
A few years ago,

862
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:43,960
his son wanted
to bring his grandson back to visit him

863
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,280
so he made this vehicle

864
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,150
and added the hood

865
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:47,590
with some dolls.

866
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:48,670
However, his grandson didn't visit him

867
00:54:48,670 --> 00:54:49,920
so he didn't remove the hood.

868
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:52,070
Did you find the vehicle?

869
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:53,440
Not yet

870
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,280
but we've issued
a citywide search notice.

871
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:56,230
We should find it soon.

872
00:54:56,670 --> 00:54:57,400
Continue.

873
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,110
This is

874
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:01,710
the camera footage

875
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:03,670
around Liu Sancheng's house that night.

876
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:24,360
Liu, what are you doing
so late at night?

877
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:25,190
I have something to do.

878
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:26,230
All right.

879
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:33,320
There are no cameras

880
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:34,590
around Liu Sancheng's house.

881
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,510
The earliest he appeared
in the camera footage

882
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:39,110
was 8:13 PM.

883
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,110
He came out of this alley

884
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:42,880
and turned into this alley.

885
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:46,800
Later, he kept
going straight in that alley

886
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:48,510
and entered the area without any cameras

887
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:50,230
that we mentioned earlier.
