It's going to hurt a bit.

7
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,160
How's the inmate?

8
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,920
She passed out

9
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,080
and only sustained minor knee injuries.

10
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,490
I see.

11
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,040
There's one more thing.

12
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,880
She has Alzheimer's.

13
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,420
Are you sure?

14
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,800
I've performed an initial assessment,

15
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,200
and it's clear she has Alzheimer's.

16
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,680
I'll see what I can do about it.

17
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,160
Please do.

18
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,180
Right.

19
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,560
Are you badly hurt, Pa?

20
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,480
I'm okay, love.

21
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,640
It was careless of me.

22
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,240
The 3D gang did this to you, right?

23
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,360
It was an accident.

24
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,880
Nobody was to blame.

30
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,400
I'll be fine soon.

31
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,270
Hey.

32
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,700
Mangpor's business
is doing so much better.

33
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,260
Are you concerned about this?

34
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,480
Do you want me to tell her to pull back?

35
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,400
No need to do that.

36
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,440
The more sales she makes, the better.

37
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,360
We simply have to increase the cut.

38
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,880
No problem. I'll look into that.

39
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,200
By the way...

40
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,200
I need your help.

41
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,560
What is it?

42
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,440
Well...

43
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,880
Can you keep an eye on Claire?

44
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,720
I'm worried she'll have
her revenge on Deedee and Duen.

45
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,960
Do your sisters

46
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,400

47
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,960

Dao.

49
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,280
You've got to make sure they behave.

50
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,560
Don't make me change my mind
about their requests,

51
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,320
or no one will be able to
take care of your mother

52
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,640
and your son.

53
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,800
Hey.

54
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,280
Remember this.

55
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,120
If I didn't adore you,

56
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,120
you wouldn't get to live
this comfortably.

57
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,060
You know that, right?

58
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,240
How can an inmate enter this room?

59
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,250
I called her myself.

60
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,120
Is something urgent?

61
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,400
I need to discuss something private.

62
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,120
You may leave.

63
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:38,880
Understood.

64
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,640
Dad.

65
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,760
You told me a male guard
always has to be with a female one,

66
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,160
so what was that about?

67
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,480
The female inmate Dao

68
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,160
is the head of the inmates.

69
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,440
She was just here
to give me a general report.

70
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,010
So what's the matter?

71
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,840
In the evening, in the leisure room,

72
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,440
inmate Duen pushed inmate Porn,
causing her to pass out.

73
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,070
Inmate Dao already reported that to me,

74
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:20,240
stating it was an accident.

75
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,600
I heard there was a fight
before the assault

76
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,360
- and...
- What you heard

77
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,440
is different from what I've heard.

78
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,120
Inmate Dao said that
inmate Duen didn't mean to push her.

79
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,120
Even though inmate Dao was a witness,

80
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,240
inmate Duen really pushed inmate Porn,
who has Alzheimer's.

81
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,680
She requires better treatment
for her condition in a hospital.

82
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,120
Okay. That's enough.

83
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,640
As for the issue between
those three inmates,

84
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:43,840
I've had enough.

85
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,880
Right now, you need to leave.

86
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,560
Understood.

87
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,760
Oh, my goodness!

88
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,320
Deedee, where are you going?

89
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,400
Taking a shower.

90
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,360
I'm so fucking annoyed.

91
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,360
I'm gonna take a shower to feel better.

92
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,520
But Dao told us not to go anywhere.

93
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,920
You're not letting me relieve myself?

94
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,720
Ever since I was born,

95
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,000
Dao's never slapped me in the face.

96
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,000
I don't get why she's afraid
of that Rabid Dog.

97
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,360
Don't you remember

98
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,920
how many inmates
she sent to the hospital?

99
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,920
Duen...

100
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,080
Don't tell me that
you're also scared of her.

101
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,320
Honestly, I think
she's way below your league.

102
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,440
She's simply insane,

103
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,660
not that good or anything.

104
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,920
One more.

105
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,280
Oh, my...

106
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,120
I told you not to let anyone in.

107
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,600
Rabid Dog...

108
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,040
Don't be so scared.

109
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,640
Or else it won't be fun.

110
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,520
Who told you I'm scared of you?

111
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,300
That's great, then.

112
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,360
Karakade and Mathusorn,
where did you go?

113
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,400
Come and help us!

114
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,800
Don't...

115
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,590
Hey! Let me go!

116
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,080
Stop it!

117
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,400
You're actually trying to kill us?

118
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,080
Stop!

119
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,880
Stop it! I give up!

120
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,880
I give up.

121
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,800
Let go of my sis.

122
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,600
I gave up.

123
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,880
Don't mess with my company again.

124
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,760
Duen...

125
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,840
You need to have
her confession invalidated.

126
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,480
How can I do that?

127
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,240
The court has rendered its verdict.

128
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,200
You put an innocent person behind bars.

129
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,560
Aren't you feeling anything?

130
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,960
Why didn't you raise an objection
during the announcement?

131
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,320
Can you stop getting on my nerves?

132
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,200
You were there.
You knew he forced me.

133
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,600
I had no choice.

134
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,760
Top,

135
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,440
I had no choice, either.

136
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,920
I did it for your own good,

137
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,360

are you taking my car?

143
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,620
What a speed demon.

144
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,120
I sold it.

145
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,200
How could you?

146
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,960
How am I supposed to get around now?

147
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,760
That's your problem,

148
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,080
not mine.

149
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,040
If you want to get around,

150
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,540
just hail a cab.

151
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,160
You're not going to visit
your girlfriend in prison, are you?

152
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,280
You're so dense,

153
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,600
you don't get anything.

154
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,040

And your girlfriend
got arrested on such charges...

158
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,600
Bell didn't do it.

159
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,400
Who cares if she did it or not?

160
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,040
Just going to the prison
will make the headlines.

161
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,840
Delete all of her photos.

162
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,040
Make sure they can't trace back to you.

163
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,480
Got it?

164
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:52,880
What?

165
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,880
You're mad at me?

166
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,360
You want to punch me, huh?

167
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,080
Go ahead. Do it.

168
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:03,960
Here.

169
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,760
If you punch me right now,

170
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,920
I might see

171
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,520
the man in you.

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,760
I'm not on duty anymore.

182

What?

184
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,960
Then who's in charge?

185
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,240

00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,520
- Hey!
- Hey! Move it!

189
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,200
What happened to you?

190
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,800
You're bleeding.

191
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,720
I ran into a cell door.

192
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,370
How's Pa'Porn?

193
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,640
She's alright.

194
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,480
What about you?

195
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,800
What's wrong?

196
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,320
Why do you look so down?

197
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,480
Oh...

198
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,640
Something threw me off earlier,

199
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,580
but I'm fine now.

200
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,400
Better now?

201
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,160
Your nose, I mean.

202
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,570
Oh...

203
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,920
It'll get better.

204
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,880
Thank you.

205
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,560
Take the meds, okay?

206
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Then, you can sleep.

207
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,240
All good?

208
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,280
Open your mouth.

209
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,760
Alright.

210
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,860
You're amazing, like always.

211
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,920
Why are you sleeping so early tonight?

212
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,160
Are you a young girl or something?

213
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,040
Tomorrow is
the family visit day, isn't it?

214
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,160
My son...

215
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,400
He's coming to see me.

216
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,000
Then rest well, okay?

217
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,390
Thank you, love.

218
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,840
Since I was born,

219
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,400
I've never had ill will towards anyone.

220
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,920
Just being thrown in prison
is bad enough.

221
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,880
Is it too much to ask
for just one good thing?

222
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,200
A pair of size 38 shoes, please.

223
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,560
Out of stock.

224
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,680
What about the one behind you?

225
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,200
Out of stock.

226
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,200
Can't you just have a look at it for me?

227
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,160
Size 38 shoes.

228
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,360
I told you we're out of stock.

229
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,720
Oh, Bell?

230
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,480
Where are your shoes?

231
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,080
I stopped by the Buddha room,

232
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,540
and then they were gone.

233
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,800
Just go and get a new pair.

234
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,880
It won't cost much.

235
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,040
I've already been there,

236
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,640
but it was sold out.

237
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:30,920
Sold out?

238
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,680
Mm.

239
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,240
Oh, I forgot.

240
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,200
The general shop
is run by Deedee's company.

241
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,320
Well...

242
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,840
After I'm done working,

243
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,480
I'll get you a pair, okay?

244
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,120
Thank you.

245
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,480
I'll repay you as soon as I can.

246
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,820
Don't mention it. It's nothing.

247
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,340
I think

248
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,160
we have to find a way to make them
stop messing with you,

249
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,600
or else you won't make it.

250
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,360
I'll help you, okay?

251
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,680
Please don't.

252
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,360
You might get dragged into this.

253
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,840
Just knowing you want to help me

254
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,560
means a lot to me.

255
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,520
How far did you walk here barefoot?

256
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,320
Just look at my feet.

257
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,840
Do we know each other?

258
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,880
Pa, my name is Claire.

259
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,480
You're waiting for your son, right?

260
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,840
He said he'd be a bit late,

261
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,320
so he wanted me to take you
for a stroll in the meantime.

262
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,400
Please go for a stroll with me.

263
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,120
Oh...

264
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,080
What is this room, love?

265
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,800
It's a storage room.

266
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,080
There's a Buddha image, too.

267
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,440
I want to pray for a bit.

268
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,440
Let me pray first, okay?

269
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:28,080
(Chanting)

270
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,720
Claire?

271
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,840
Has my son died?

272
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,360
I remember now, love.

273
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,840
When his funeral was held,

274
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,360
I was praying, just like this.

275
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,640
Someone hurt him

276
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,920
and took his life.

277
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,120
So I ran over the perpetrator.

278
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,840
That...

279
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,760
That's why I ended up here?

280
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,000
- May I share the bed with you?
- Sure.

281
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,960
Why are you so kind to me, love?

282
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,560
When I first arrived here,

283
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,120
you were the only person

284
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,960
who took care of me

285
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,840
and even taught me gardening.

286
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,440
So, are you good at it now?

287
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,600
Why?

288
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,960
I didn't keep at it consistently.

289
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,800
My instructor is forgetful...

290
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,520
I'm sorry, love.

291
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,800
Why are you waking up so early, Pa?

292
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,400
I'm going for a walk to get some exercise.

293
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,400
You...

294
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,120
Please take care of the plants, okay?

295
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,360
No worries, Pa.

296
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,640
I'll take care of them.

297
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,560
Hey.

298
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,120
Your business is doing well, huh?

299
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,560
Oh, sis...

300
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,640
Where did you get the news?

301
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,000
It's only doing alright.

302
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:19,800
Oh.

303
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:21,960
Is that so?

304
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,120
My sales have dropped

305
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,760
because inmates
are buying from you, huh?

306
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,880
Oh, well...

307
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,040
If my sales are high,

308
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,000
you'll get your cut too, right?

309
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,120
I think my cut
should be increased, right?

310
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,620
Increased?

311
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,780
The 30% cut

312
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,160
is already a lot.

313
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,680
You've been selling more.

314
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,960
You're selling your stuff on our turf.

315
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,680
That means it should be
a 50-50 split, right?

316
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,720
Oh, come on.

317
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,400
I've got initial costs to pay as well.

318
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,560
How about a 60-40 split?

319
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,440
If I raise the prices,

320
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,080
no one's going to buy my stuff.

321
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,000
If that's the case,
we'll both earn nothing.

322
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,060
If we can't settle on a 50-50 split,

323
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,040
you're out of business.

324
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,700
That's a yes if you're taking this long.

325
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,760
Let's go.

326
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,440
Wait!

327
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,760
I'll make it a 50-50 split.

328
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,280
Don't be late with the payment.

329
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,520
What are you doing?

330
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,120
I'm sorry. I just wanted to help.

331
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,440
Stay out of this.

332
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,480
Why aren't they sprouting buds?

333
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,000
I can step in now, can't I?

334
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,760
Roses prefer rich,
well-drained loamy soil.

335
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,720
They grow well in sunny spots.

336
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,560
The sunnier, the better.

337
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,360
So we have to move them, right?

338
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,480
The first step is to change the soil.

339
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,280
We might as well move them
while we're at it.

340
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,120
Where are the garden trowels
and shovels?

341
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,560
I'll go get them.

342
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,200
Just put them there.

343
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,160
Over there.

344
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,800
Yeah, right there.

345
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,520
Here it is.

346
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,160
You're off to a good start.

347
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,960
If we help tend the roses,

348
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,400
they'll grow and flourish, I'm sure.

349
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,680
Trust me.

350
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:29,880
Right?

351
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,360
Mm.

352
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,640
I guess.

353
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,520
Oh, hello!
How are you doing, love?

354
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,400
- Hello, Pa.
- Hi.

355
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,160
How are you?

356
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,760
- I'm doing great.
- That's lovely.

357
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,280
Pa, how are you?

358
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,520
I'm doing well, love.

359
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,720
- Please be careful while walking.
- Thank you.

360
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,880
Outside?

361
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,640
Right.

362
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,850
- Hello, Pa'Porn.
- Oh, hello, love.

363
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,360
- What are you doing?
- Hello.

364
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,040
- We're tidying up the lawn.
- Oh, I see.

365
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,560
- The weather's nice today.
- Yes, love.

366
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,760
You're gorgeous!

367
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,640
You're the most beautiful of all!

368
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,080
Go back where you came from
right now, Kae.

369
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,720
Girls, I've got to talk to you.

370
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,920
But we have nothing
to talk about with you.

371
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,390
I have a way for you

372
00:35:29,415 --> 00:35:31,265
to gain more money
and power than Wichai.

373
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,920
That's garbage.

374
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,400
Are you pulling my leg or what?

375
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,800
I'm serious.

376
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,800
Do you want to know?

377
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,440
What is it?

378
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,360
Loan money to inmates.

379
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,200
I'm the moneylender,

380
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,840
and you bring us clients.

381
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,040
Then the profits are split 50-50.

382
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,760
Loan money?

383
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,280
Who are we going to lend money to?

384
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,680
Ridiculous.

385
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,680
The inmates, of course.

386
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,440
They need money to buy stuff.

387
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,960
If they take a loan from us,

388
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,320
the interest is yours.

389
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,240
This will make you rich in no time.

390
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,160
With that wealth comes power.

391
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,120
Everyone will have to respect you,

392
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,920
even Wichai.

393
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,880
We'll check with Dao first.

394
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,360
If you do that, he'll find out about this.

395
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,400
Then he'll ask for a cut,
just like he did with Mangpor's business.

396
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,440
Trust me.

397
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,360
We can run this business by ourselves.

398
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,280
It's just Deedee,

399
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,000
Duen,

400
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,160
- Karakade,
- Oh?!

401
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,280
and Mathusorn.

402
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,720
You just find and convince our clients.

403
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,520
I'll lend them money.

404
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,300
Simple as that.

405
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,000
What do you want...

406
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,440
out of this?

407
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,120
Just get your hands off Bell

408
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,120
and part ways.

409
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,240
That's all I ask.

410
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,760
Gosh.

411
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,200
Why's everyone backing that girl?

412
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,480
Why do I have to adhere to your plan?

413
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,880
Take the money and get even with Bell,

414
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,400
sounds much better, doesn't it?

415
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,920
If you lay a hand on Bell,

416
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,360
you won't get any money from me.

417
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,560
As for this plan to loan money,

418
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,360
I'll propose it to the others instead.

419
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,200
Oh...

420
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,720
Think carefully

421
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,200
about the offer.

422
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,160
Help me get power first,

423
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,800
and we'll talk about this later.

424
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:32,960
Sure.

425
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,960
Just wait and see.

426
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,400
Consider the plan.

427
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,360
Interesting, isn't it?

428
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,320
Yeah!

429
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,200
- Sis!
- Hey!

430
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,480
You should consider her offer.

431
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,960
It does sound great.

432
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,960
♫Who wants to be a millionaire?♫

433
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,360
♫Me, of course!♫

434
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,360
Sis, let me take care of this.

435
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,080
- Go, go, go!
- Sure!

436
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,160
Shit! Kae!

437
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,720
Why were you so quiet?
You scared me!

438
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,120
Hey, Deedee's offering loans

439
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,040
at a 20 percent interest rate.

440
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,080
Are you interested?

441
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,320
20 percent?

442
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,720
Gosh, that's too much.

443
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,800
That's a no for me.

444
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,200
I'm here to talk business.

445
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,760
Enough of this.

446
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,840
I'm done splitting cuts with people.

447
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,880
I'm not here to ask for a cut.

448
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,600
I'm here to ask you
to be my business partner.

449
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,920
Sister.

450
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,280
Want to get a loan?

451
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,000
Why do I need that much money here?

452
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,280
I'm loaning money.

453
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,120
Once the inmates have money,

454
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,680
they'll order stuff from you.

455
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,960
In return, this gives you more clients.

456
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,440
What about you? Are you interested?

457
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,280
No, I don't want to be in debt.

458
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,160
What do I have to do?

459
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,760
Sell your entire stock

460
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,430
to me.

461
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,160
No inmates want to take a loan.

462
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,360
Do you know the concept
of demand and supply?

463
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,720
We stayed quiet 'cause we don't know.

464
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,280
Damn, just explain it!

465
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,000
Let me illustrate.

466
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,480
It's simple.
Demand is a desire to purchase.

467
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,600
Supply is the goods we have.

468
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:11,760
We have to make them want our supplies

469
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,720
so much that they'll take out loans

470
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,760
to buy what they want.

471
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,200
If people really want our supplies,

472
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,280
we can charge whatever we want.

473
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,600
Stand in line, please!

474
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:28,280
Now, we can just sit back
and earn our profit.

475
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,680
It's basically killing two birds
with one stone.

476
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,880
- Give me one!
- I'll take two.

477
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,080
20 percent, okay?

478
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,400
All done.

479
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,560
Whose is this?

480
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,600
I got it for you.

481
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,800
You didn't have any the other day.

482
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,000
Whoa.

483
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,400
I'm actually craving this.

484
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,020
Thank you.

485
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,640
What's gotten into you?

486
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,920
I've got good news.

487
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,960
I...

488
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,200
I've cleared things up
with Deedee for you.

489
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,960
From now on,

490
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,200
they won't be messing
with you ever again.

491
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,560
How did you do that?

492
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,160
With my brainpower.

493
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,760
Everybody has desires.

494
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:07,800
I just fulfill them

495
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,960
to get what I want in return.

496
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,880
It's a win-win.

497
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,000
So, what does

498
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,000
she want?

499
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:18,040
Never mind.

500
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,720
You don't need to know everything.

501
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,480
Is it good that she stopped
messing with you?

502
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,840
Pa'Porn.

503
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,400
Please return to your cell.

504
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,440
It's getting late already.

505
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:39,960
Sure.

506
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,760
Let me guess...

507
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,560
The shoes are sold out?

508
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,240
Are you kidding me?

509
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,240
We've got a whole lot of them here.

510
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,160
Are you blind or what?

511
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,720
Yours is size 38, right?

512
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,200
How much?

513
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,600
Don't worry.

514
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,880
Just have to pay us back later.

515
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,040
Oh, thank you.

516
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:21,960
Bye!

517
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,000
Am I now sharing the room with you?

518
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,480
I'm sorry for entering
without telling you.

519
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,280
I just need a place to be alone.

520
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,160
Are you telling me to leave?

521
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:40,760
No, I'm not.

522
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,240
Come and join me.

523
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:44,680
Thanks for letting me in.

524
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,760
New shoes?

525
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,600
I lost the old pair.

526
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,680
That's why I had to get a new pair.

527
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,240
Here.

528
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,400
Write your name on them.

529
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,360
So, you can find out
who took them later.

530
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:41,960
I'd better put your name on these,

531
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,920
so nobody dares to steal them.

532
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,600
Suit yourself.

533
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,120
And...

534
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,660
What mood are you in,

535
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,800
sitting here all by yourself?

536
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,160
Exhausted? I guess?

537
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,080
I feel like I'm fighting by myself.

538
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,080
Fighting against what?

539
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,800
At first...

540
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,480
I was fighting for my freedom.

541
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:16,560
Now...

542
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,120
It's like I'm just fighting
to survive here.

543
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:25,680
You're not fighting alone, you know?

544
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Everyone's fighting for the same thing.

545
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:35,960
To survive...

546
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:38,720
and get out of here.

547
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,200
What about you?

548
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:47,840
What are you fighting for?

549
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,840
I'm not fighting for anything.

550
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,920
I chose to stay here.

551
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:59,200
Life out there...

552
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:04,000
There's not much for me to hope for.

553
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,640
Perhaps,

554
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,440
I'm much happier living here.

555
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,880
Can I ask you something?

556
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,440
Why do you always help me?

557
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,920
I just hate seeing
someone get threatened.

558
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:41,380
That's all.

559
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:45,880
Or is it because you like me?

560
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,720
What kind of nonsense was that?

561
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,340
You want a piece of this?

562
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,120
Stop trying to scare me.

563
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,240
If you were going to hurt me,

564
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,320
you would've done it long ago.

565
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:05,760
Fine.

566
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,240
You don't have to answer me.

567
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,360
You remind me of myself

568
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:26,640
when I first got here.

569
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:30,240
How so?

570
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,240
I felt lost

571
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,240
in the dark.

572
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:41,420
I know

573
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:44,760
how bad you must've felt,

574
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,400
the overwhelming feeling,

575
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,840
and doubts, asking yourself,

576
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:56,200
"Why does it have to be me

577
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,520
who ends up here,

578
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,800
even though I did nothing wrong?

579
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,240
Why

580
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,800
do they have to leave me all alone?"

581
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,840
That makes me realize

582
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,280
how important it is

583
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,200
to have someone by our side.

584
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,320
So, back to my first question.

585
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,000
Do you like me?

586
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,200
How are things?

587
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,240
Feeling better?

588
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:38,680
Mm. I'm much better now.

589
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,440
Have a good rest, then.

590
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,280
Inmate Bell. Step outside.

591
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:52,480
Yes?

592
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:56,800
[Claire]

593
00:50:58,720 --> 00:50:59,720
A visitor is coming to see you.

594
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:03,280
Right now?

595
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:05,680
Just move already.

596
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,520
I'll wait outside, okay?

597
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:37,640
Oh, Pa?

598
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:38,680
Hitting the hay already?

599
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,200
You haven't taken your meds yet.

600
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,760
Where did you put your meds?

601
00:51:58,960 --> 00:51:59,960
Have a seat. Bell.

602
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,400
I'm sorry.

603
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:11,440
I'm truly sorry, Bell.

604
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,760
I had no choice.

605
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,040
My dad forced me to say those words.

606
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,000
It's fine, Top.

607
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:23,720
I'm down to break up.

608
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:26,480
If you're not helping me,

609
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,080
then I'll find a way out myself.

610
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,920
Bell, I'm really sorry.

611
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,760
I didn't mean to do that.

612
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:33,920
I've never wanted to break up with you...

613
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,040
- My dad...
- Stop talking.

614
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:41,800
I just want to know

615
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:44,960
why you stopped hiring Nurse Auay.

616
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:49,160
Pa.

617
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:52,120
Pa.

618
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:55,680
Pa...

619
00:52:58,880 --> 00:52:59,800
Pa...

620
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:04,200
Pa'Porn!

621
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,480
Wake up, beautiful!

622
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,840
The reason I'm here is

623
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,520
to tell you this.

624
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,560
Stay calm, okay?

625
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:31,320
So...

626
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:36,760
Your dad has passed away.

627
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:58,240
Pa...

628
00:53:58,520 --> 00:53:59,440
Pa!

629
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:00,800
Guards!

630
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,480
Guards!

631
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,840
Help Pa, please!

632
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,280
Pa'Porn.

633
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:11,440
Pa'Porn...

634
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,360
Please come and help her!

635
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,160
Pa'Porn...

636
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,680
We made our promise, didn't we?

637
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:33,000
Please keep our promise, Pa.
