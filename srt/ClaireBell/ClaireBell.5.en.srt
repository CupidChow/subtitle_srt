00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,080
Are you hungry?

7
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,400
No.

8
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,640
But I am.

9
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,190
Let's go.

10
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,500
Wait.

11
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,620
Hold it.

12
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,480
The lighting there is really good.

13
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,840
You can draw?

14
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,600
I kind of can,

15
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,040
but it's been a while.

16
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,800
You've got so many skills, don't you?

17
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,760
When I was young,
my mom taught me how to draw.

18
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,000
But since she passed away,
I haven't done any artwork.

19
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,640
I still can't believe
both of my parents are gone.

20
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,440
It feels kind of weird when it hits me.

21
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,320
How exactly?

22
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,680
It's like there's a void
inside my heart.

23
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,040
It's bottomless.

24
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,800
It's a reminder that

25
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,080
from now on, I'm truly alone.

26
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,080

27
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,240

31
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,600
You know how to draw, too?

32
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,880
No, it's my first time.

33
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,360

all sorts of things with, right?

that nervous while sketching?

36

Well, it's my first time.

37
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,080
Be patient with me, okay?

38
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,800
Take it easy.

39
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,040
Don't worry about it.
It'll turn out just fine.

I'll be going, then.

You might be upset
because of what I said,

wants to pick up the goods,

65

You're not giving this
to Kae anymore?

She's now working in the kitchen.

68
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,480
She works in the kitchen now?

69
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,520
Yeah. She didn't tell you that?

70
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,560
Maybe she can handle seeing
what caused her pain.

71
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,960
I'm kidding, by the way.

72
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,360
It was just a tease.

73
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:43,570
I'll leave the packages to you.

Do you need my help?

79
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,400
It's okay.

80
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,440
Just stopping by is enough.

81
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,960
Hey, hey, hey! Look!

82
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,400
They're holding hands, too.

83
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,480

84
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,070
How adorable.

85
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,160
Look at them.

86
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,360
You can't hide here, okay?

87
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,400
I chose to work here,

88
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,600
so we can talk business more easily.

89
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,600
Right...

I can even see it from miles away.

91
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,960
Don't use our business as an excuse.

92
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,850
What's the plan?

93
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,640
Do you want Duen and Karakade
to deal with her?

94
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,280
No need.

95
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,960
By the way,

In a good way or a bad way?

104
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,160
In a good way, of course.

105
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,800

Stop teasing.

110
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:29,960
Dig in!

111
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,320
You said

112
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,120
it's just the two of us, didn't you?

113
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,040
Claire,

114
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,520
this is the canteen.

115
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,470
So many people here.

It's alright.

127
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,960
Right? This is great.

128
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,440
It's stunning.

129
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,160
Can you delete the video?

130
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,800
Is there a problem?

131
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,760
I was in the video.

132
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,520
Come on, you weren't even the focus.

133
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,200
Please. I feel uncomfortable about it.

134
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,200
Just do it for her.

135
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,960
Thank you.

136
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,560
Let's do another take.

137
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,800
Ready? One, two, three!

138
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,320
The loan amount looks very good.

139
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:28,560
The number of inmates taking loans
has gone up by almost 20%.

140
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,240
That's great.

141
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,480
Should we split the cut now?

142
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,080
Not now.

143
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,640
We still don't have enough money.

144
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,080
What? But you said we grew by 20%.

145
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,840
- Where's the money?
- Yeah.

146
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,360
Well...

147
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,520
It's in circulation.

148
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,840
In circulation?

149
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,320
What the hell does that mean?

150
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,440
I still don't get what 20% means.

151
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,680
To put it simply...

152
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,320
I use a portion of the money
to encourage inmates to take loans.

153
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,800
That's the initial investment.

154
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,240
It's separate from everything else.

155
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,120
Another portion goes to those
who borrowed money from us.

156
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,760
What we get monthly
in return is the interest,

157
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,000
which they pay with either their wages
or money sent by their relatives.

158
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,840
Once we receive the money,

159
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,320
we split it.

160
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,840
Why don't we just take the money
from them now?

161
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,600
Yeah, she has a point.

162
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,040
It's not worth it right now.

163
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,720
Say, if you lend 100 baht
to your friend,

164
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,280
that's the amount
you'll get back right now.

165
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,160
However, if we wait a month,

166
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,560
what we'll get instead is 120 baht.

167
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,000
Now, multiply that by a year.

168
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,160
How much will we get instead?

169
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,880
Money's rolling in, huh?

170
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,080
What are you doing?

171
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,120
- Dao!
- Sit down!

172
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,000
If I hadn't forced Mangpor
to tell the truth,

173
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,800
I'd have been clueless for ages.

174
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,880
How dare you two do this to me?

175
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,880
Dao, I'm sorry.

176
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,760
I've been wanting to tell you,

177
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,480
but I don't want Wichai
to get a share.

178
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,560
Kae manipulated you, didn't she?

179
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,320
Get back all of the stuff

180
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,600
and return the money to them.

181
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,040
Cancel the loan, too, got it?!

182
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,680
It can't be done.

183
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,000
Why?

184
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,560

The accused, who stabbed
the victim with scissors to death,

213
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,280
was highly audacious and cruel.

214
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:25,080
The victim was a teacher

216

Is it true that the murderer

217
00:17:29,172 --> 00:17:31,042
stabbed the victim
19 times with scissors?

218

Let's do some grafting today.

221
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,520
It's so that
we don't have to get more seeds.

222
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,600
Alright.

Okay...

224
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,600
Here's the first step.

225
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,960
Find a mature branch, not too old

226
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,560
or too young.

227
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,920

228

Here.

229

Oh...

230
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:24,600
Next, cut in an area of the bark.

231
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,640
Just cut the bark out, right?

232
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:27,960
Mm.

233
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,000
At the top, cut just under the node.

234
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,320
At the bottom,
cut right above the node.

235
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,280
Oh, okay.

236
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,600
You got it.

Are you hurt?

240
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,600
An ant sting hurts more.

and we won't get to borrow a knife.

244

comes from inmates
taking out loans to buy the goods.

about any of that.

the deceased inmate
also had Alzheimer's.

368
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,120
Uh...

369
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,600
She didn't, sir.

370
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,120
I think

371
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,840
there must be
some misunderstanding, sir.

372
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,640
Several reports had been made
to the Department of Corrections,

373
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,840
claiming that her cause of death

374
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,480
was likely due to an overdose

375
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,280
because of Alzheimer's.

376
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,120
I think the intention of the reports

377
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,440
must be to tarnish
the reputation of this prison, sir.

378
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,400
The deceased herself...

379
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,880
The report came from someone
in the prison.

380
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,440
If the claim is true,

381
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,880
I'll probably have to step in

382
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,040
and find out why the deceased

383
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,040
wasn't hospitalized.

384
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,840
Make sure you have
your part of the details prepared.

385
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,360
Yes, sir.

386
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,590
Did you send the reports about
inmate Porn to the department?

387
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,000
The Department of Corrections
contacted me.

388
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,480
All I did was provide them with info.

389
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,200
What did you tell them?

390
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,720
I told them that

391
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,200
inmate Porn had Alzheimer's,

392
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,640
which could lead her
to overdose and die.

393
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,680
Porsches!

394
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,440
You aren't a doctor.

395
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,720
You're just a guard.

396
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,920
Giving false information like that...

397
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,400
Do you know how troubled I'd be?

398
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,940
The false information is about
the cause of death,

399
00:30:25,969 --> 00:30:27,399
stated as heart failure.

400
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,520
How did you know
if it's true or false?

401
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,320
Before inmate Porn
returned to her cell,

402
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,160
I found her empty medicine bottle.

403
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,760
I asked the nurse

404
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,240
and found out that
it was for her antihypertensive.

405
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,560
Everything
that inmate Claire said is true.

406
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,720
Inmate Porn

407
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,840
overdosed and died.

408
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,200
Porsches!

409
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,400
What are you trying to do?

410
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,040
I was just saying the truth.

411
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,600
Gosh, Porsches...

412
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,200
What were you thinking?!

413
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,600
I just think that...

414
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,660
If this were to happen to me,

415
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,880
I would want everybody
to know the truth,

416
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,040
not a twisted version from someone
trying to cover up their mistakes.

417
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,120
My dear father and son...

418
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,520
How's it going, working as a guard?

419
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,040
It's going great.

420
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,720
I've discovered
so many untold things.

421
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:43,950
Hm?

422
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,880
It's nothing.

423
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,000
Have some fruits, then.

424
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,120
Thanks.

425
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,760
Whoa!

426
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,200
You came out of nowhere.

427
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,040
So soft.

428
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,120
What soft?

429
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,480
The bras, of course.

430
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,720
See?

431
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,040
Teasing me?

432
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,880
I like you.

433
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,800
That's why I teased you.

434
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,200
I want to hang my clothes!

435
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,640
I want to do my laundry
like they do!

436
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,280
Gosh...

437
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,720
Are you heading outside, dear?

438
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,480
We'd like to talk with you
for a minute.

439
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,480
I received a call from your university,

440
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,560
saying that you've been absent
from several classes.

441
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,320
Is something wrong, honey?

442
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,360
I'm fine, Mom,

443
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,440
like always.

444
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,680
If there's something on your mind,

445
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,000
feel free to share it with us.

446
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,720
Do you think
I have something on my mind?

447
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,280
If it's about your sister,

448
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,360
I don't want this to stress you out.

449
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,160
Everybody has their own paths.

450
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,720
She sees the world
differently from you.

451
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,560
If that's how she chooses to live,

452
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,760
then that's where she'll end up.

453
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,880
You said that like
Claire isn't your daughter.

454
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,800
Natty.

455
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,800
Natty?

456
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,280
Yeah!

457
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,920
My name is Natty.

458
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,240
It's the name that reminds me
I'm no longer Claire's sister.

459
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,880
What's the matter with you?

460
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,560
Why are you so angry?

461
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,440
I'm angry because
you all act like Claire doesn't exist.

462
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:55,160
You judge her by a single action, Dad.

463
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,800
And Mom,
you completely agreed with him.

464
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,120
Claire killed a man!

465
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,680
Having to change your name
and move to a different school

466
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,760
wasn't because of what she did?

467
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,280
She's nice to me, Dad.

468
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,000
You don't know anything.

469
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,560
Do you know
how much this hurts me?

470
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,920
You keep telling me to forget her
and not talk about her,

471
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,400
but I just can't.

472
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,040
Do you understand, Dad?

473
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,800
I want to see Claire.

474
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:48,040
I just want to talk to her,
but even that is impossible.

475
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,840
We...

476
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,280
We don't hate Claire, dear.

477
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,280
We've never told you to hate her.

478
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,720
We just want you to be happy.

479
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,040
Be happy?

480
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,000
I guess you may have done
something wrong, then.

481
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,120
Because I've never been happy.

482
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,400
Girls!

483
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,880
100 inmates are coming
to have a meal!

484
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,280
The food must be
ready on time and tasty!

485
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,000
Go!

486
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,110
Yes, Chef!

487
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,120
Salty.

488
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,680
Bland!

489
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,000
Brown rice.
It contains minerals and vitamins.

490
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:48,120
Good.

491
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:48,900
Yes, Chef.

492
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,240
The inmates
are paying back their loans.

493
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,600
I'll give you the cuts later.

494
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,800
Gosh, finally.

495
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,520
Mangpor, my lipstick?

496
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,360
I'll get you one
at the end of next month.

497
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,840
Gosh, that's going to take forever.

498
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,440
Beautiful girls can't wait.

499
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,040
Do you want to borrow mine?

500
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,460
You've already put on lipstick?

501
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,640
What color is that?
It's like you're sick.

502
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,800
I'll get you a new one.

503
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,960
It's so pale.

504
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,360
Kae,

505
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,860
do we have to get rid of the crust?

506
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:18,080
I told you not to cut it!

507
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,400
Yes, chef!

508
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,200
Don't stop working.

509
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,320
I'm just getting my stuff.

510
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,040
Oh...

511
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,160
Next time, don't drop it off here.

512
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,680
This is no longer my place.

513
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,580
I'll tell you later.

514
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,930
Right, sis.

515
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,800
Dao.

516
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,720
I've changed my mind.

517
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,920
Would you like
to do business with me?

518
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,800
You can have Duen's cut.

519
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,480
Huh?

520
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,840
It's already little to nothing.

521
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,200
I don't want your money.

522
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,930
May your business thrive and prosper.

523
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,720
It seems like

524
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,240
you're going to stay here
for a long time.

525
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,840
Karakade, my mirror!

526
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,760
Yes, ma'am!

527
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,520
Gosh! I can't!

528
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,440
Where are you going, Deedee?

529
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,480
Don't follow me.

530
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,320
Don't run away from me.

531
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,080
I'm not.

532
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,720
I'm getting a female guard.

533
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,200
I can't be alone
with a female inmate.

534
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,880
I just want to talk.

535
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,320
I'm not going to tell anybody.

536
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,360
It won't take long.

537
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,480
What is it about?

538
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,200
I want my lipstick back.

539
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,480
It's against the rules.

540
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,400
I know that it is,

541
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,520
but can I at least use it up?

542
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,560
Why do you want
the lipstick back so badly?

543
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,160
It makes me feel confident.

544
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,270
Being stuck here is bad enough.

545
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,760
Can I just look a little prettier?

546
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,640
You already are pretty.

547
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,640
Stop messing around.

548
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,480
I am not.

549
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,800
It's true.

550
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,720
Even without makeup,

551
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,560
you're still good-looking.

552
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,720
Here's the deal.

553
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,480
I'd like to get my lipstick back,

554
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,670
and if I use it all up,

555
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,600
I'll stop buying more.

556
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,480
Deal?

557
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,080
It really can't be done.

558
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,400
Please, can I have it back?

559
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,800
I feel like I have no confidence.

560
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,480
Please, please, please.

561
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,400
Please.

562
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:46,520
You always carry it around?

563
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,800
I actually want to return it to you.

564
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,160
It's just that I want a female guard
to go with me at first.

565
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,280
Mm...

566
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,000
Next time,
you can just return stuff to me.

567
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,440
I won't snitch.

568
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,760
There will be next time?

569
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,440
Who knows.

570
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,240
But you said
you wouldn't buy another one!

571
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,680
Duen, are you sick?

572
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,920
You've been coughing like this
since morning.

573
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,240
Do you want some medicine?

574
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,800
Mm... I'm a bit sick.

575
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:40,040
Can I have some
of your antihistamines, Kae?

576
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,200
That should make me feel better.

577
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,240
I ran out.

578
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,000
What?!

579
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,480
How come?

580
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,320
The bottle was full yesterday.

581
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,400
I gave them to others.

582
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,400
Kae, you're mean

583
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,400
and stingy.

584
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,600
Sis, do you want a face mask?

585
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,840
Give it to her.

586
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,880
She's coughing a lot.

587
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,190
Right.

588
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,760
Do you have one more?

589
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,080
I'm out.

590
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,510
Hey!

591
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,320
Duen!

592
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,920
- Oh, f*ck!
- Whoa!

593
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,960
Duen!

594
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,520
I'm sorry.

595
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,440
Go and sit somewhere else.

596
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:27,960
I want a new lawyer.

597
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:01,720
How did you do that?

598
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,400
I can do all sorts of things.

599
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,440
I'll teach you.

600
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,800
Your skills
are much cooler than mine.

601
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:09,640
Come on, let's go.

602
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:12,880
Let's go outside.

603
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,680
What are you doing?

604
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,200
I need to short-circuit it first.

605
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,960
The security cameras will go off.

606
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,240
I'll teach you later.

607
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,720
I've never been outside at night.

608
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,400
It's beautiful in its own way, right?

609
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:54,760
Can I have your hand?

610
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:02,940
What are you doing?

611
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,160
I'm not going to cut your hand off.
Don't worry.

612
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:11,840
Another one, too.

613
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,760
I made it myself.

614
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,360
Are you proposing to me?

615
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:41,560
Mm.

616
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,640
What do you think?

617
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,440
After proposing...

618
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,200
You also have to put it on.

619
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:40,680
♫Flowers in the garden♫

620
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:45,880
♫Being loved by someone♫

621
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,690
♫All the simplest things♫

622
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:56,040
♫They all hit me like a drum♫

623
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:01,360
♫Oh I always wondered♫

624
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,680
♫What I'm tryna prove?♫

625
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:13,120
♫Sometimes I wish I was cooler♫

626
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:17,120
♫But maybe I was born to stay♫

627
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,440
♫Maybe I was born to stay♫

628
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:23,960
♫Warm♫

629
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:27,720
♫Like the Sun♫

630
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:38,200
♫Warm like a hug♫

631
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:43,280
♫Warm for you♫

632
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,640
♫Warm for you♫

633
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:53,960
♫Warm for you♫

634
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:58,720
♫Warm for you♫

635
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,040
♫Warm for you♫

636
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:07,520
♫Like a revolution against
the things that don't make us feel♫

637
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:13,000
♫Like a revolution against
perfection 'cause that ain't real♫

638
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:18,520
♫Like a revolution against
the pressure that stops us healing♫

639
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:22,520
♫Like a revolution against perfection♫

640
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:27,760
♫Warm♫

641
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:31,560
♫Like the sun♫

♫Warm♫

643
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:42,360
♫Like a hug♫

644
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:50,000
♫Warm for you♫

645
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,360
Our feet are just as big.

646
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,520
Your shoe size is 38, right?

647
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:34,020
Mm.

648
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:48,920
[Bell]

649
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,000
Why aren't you
writing your own name?

650
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,040
You already wrote
my name on yours.

651
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,600
Now I want to write yours on mine.

652
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:16,560
This looks promising.

653
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,760
When will the flowers bloom?

654
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,040
I just told you,
when it comes to gardening,

655
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,400
you need to be patient.

656
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:32,600
Let me get
the coconut husks real quick.

657
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:33,760
Mm.

658
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:39,800
Inmate Claire.

659
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:41,520
You have a visitor.

660
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:43,880
I'm not available.

661
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,280
Tell them I'm not coming.

662
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,240
The visitor wants to talk about
your sister named Cream.

663
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,440
Cream?

664
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:25,480
How did you know about my sister?

665
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:28,340
I'm not the only one who did.

666
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:31,720
What news?

667
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,320
About 19-Stab Claire.

668
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:36,360
I found out

669
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,080
she has a sister named Cream.

670
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:40,160
[Remember
the case of 19-Stab Claire?]

671
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,600
After the incident,

672
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,800
she changed her name to Natty.

673
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,920
You've been refusing
to answer my question...

674
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,320
Is it because you didn't kill him?

675
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,280
I guess I'll have to ask her myself.

676
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:56,360
Go and spread the news.

677
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,560
Claire is serving the sentence
because...

678
00:54:58,600 --> 00:54:59,400
[This is the younger sister
of 19-Stab Claire!]

679
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,120
She's serving the sentence
on her sister's behalf.

680
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:05,840
Don't mess with my sister!

681
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,520
It's your first time
getting this angry, you know?

682
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:11,680
The real murderer is

683
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:13,120
[It's Cream who killed him]

684
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:14,560
her younger sister.

685
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,200
You really love your sister, huh?

686
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,920
It's just like
how much I love my brother.

687
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,760
I'll ruin her dear sister's life

688
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,120
and make her suffer
as much as possible.

689
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:54,920
That's nothing important.

690
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,360
Do not trust the rumor about
the number of stab wounds.

691
00:55:57,730 --> 00:56:01,030
Officers are in the process
of collecting evidence.

692
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:02,710
As for the other details,

693
00:56:02,732 --> 00:56:05,432
I am not allowed
to reveal them to the public.
