[Rabid Dog]

7
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,560
What are you doing?

8
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,320
Applying an under-eye mask.

9
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,340
You're already gorgeous.

10
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,840
Where are you going, sis?

11
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,280
Shhh!

12
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,200
See you.

13
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,280
Huh?

14
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,440
I'll be going now.

15
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,200
Where are you going this time?

16
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,880
You dropped out

17
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,120
and said you'd look for work.

18
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,410
All you do is drink.

19
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,790
I've talked to my friends.

20
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,600
I'm going to buy
and sell secondhand clothes.

21
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,560
Don't worry about me.

22
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,200
Why can't you be
a good example for Cream for once?

23
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,470
All you do is frivolous stuff.

24
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,600
Cream and I are different, Dad.

25
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,120
If she loves studying, then let her be.

26
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,800
I don't.

27
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,320
Selling secondhand goods?

28
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,480
Sneaking out at night to drink?

29
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,480
This is how you're gonna live?

30
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,280
Then I'm sorry

31
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,880
for failing to be the good girl
you expect me to be.

32
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,040
Cheers! Cheers!

33
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,640
Guys, you're drunk already?

34
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,760
Your faces are all red!

35
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,160
I'm kidding.

36
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,080
Just a bit more, come on.

37
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,800
- Hey, guys...
- Wait, cheers!

38
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,180
Watch your step.

39
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,960
This way, Claire!

40
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,880
Claire.

41
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,140
I'm home.

42
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,040
Aww, I'm actually craving this.

43
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,400
Thank you.

44
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Have you had anything?

45
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,520
I haven't, actually.

46
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Gosh.

47
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,800
You carry these every day?

48
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,080
Mm.

49
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,720
Currently, I'm preparing for
the International Physics Olympiad.

50
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,550
I've got subjects
that I'm worried I'll be behind.

51
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,060
That's why
I'm carrying the books around.

52
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,120
You're always like this.

53
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,960
You said
you couldn't study them in time,

54
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,360
but you'd always get full scores.

55
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And...

56
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,000
You're not going to continue
your studies?

57
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,720
Probably not.

58
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,960
I have no knack for this.

59
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,920
Honestly, you're a great student.

60
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,880
You learn new things so easily,

61
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,480
meanwhile I don't.

62
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,680
For example?

63
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,480
Like, riding a bicycle.

64
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,480
It took you only an hour
to figure out how to ride it.

65
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,760
The same goes for swimming.

66
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,880
I think you're talented.

67
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,240
Why are the examples
so funny-sounding?

68
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,000
Hey! They're not.

69
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,240
They're all survival skills.

70
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,880
I can't hold it anymore.

71
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,760
Hey.

72
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,600
Hm?

73
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,480
Do you want to know a secret?

74
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,700
What is it?

75
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,480
Promise me you won't tell anyone.

76
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,400
I promise.

77
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,880
I actually don't have any talents.

78
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,920
I just say, "Screw it.

79
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,920
It's okay to fail.

80
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,000
I'll keep at it until I get there."

81
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,720
When you're not worried
about making mistakes,

82
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,160
you'll learn things quickly.

83
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,280
Is the reason
you're not returning to school

84
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,280
that you're worried
you'll do worse than me?

85
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,040
Hey! I'm not worried about that.

86
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,440
- Are you?
- I'm not!

87
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,120
Let's just say that
being a good daughter

88
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,440
is your duty, okay?

89
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,840
As for being a nonsensical daughter,

90
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,760
I'll take care of that.

91
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,290
Okay?

92
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,880
Okay, I guess.

93
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,120
Come on, eat up.

94
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,520
I'm starving.

95
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,560
Let me have some of yours.

96
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,640
My cup is almost empty.

97
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,120
- No!
- Just a bit!

98
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,080
I refuse!

99
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,960
Hey, to me!

100
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,640
There!

101
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,820
Teacher Maed.

102
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,200
Can you help me with
the International Physics Olympiad?

103
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,440
I don't accept tutoring, unfortunately.

104
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,720
It needs school permission.

105
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,400
Please help me, Teacher.

106
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,080
I really want a spot
by competing in the Olympiad.

107
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,080
If the school finds out,

108
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,360
I'll be in deep trouble.

109
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,480
I beg you, Teacher.

110
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,700
I'll study hard and won't let you down.

111
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,520
Please, Teacher.

112
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,760
Fine, I'll help.

113
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,480
But you must not tell this to anybody,

114
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,360
okay?

115
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,420
Okay.

116
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,480
Uh...

117
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,960
What about the fee?

118
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,240
We'll talk about it later.

119
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,560
Yay!

120
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,760
Thank you! Thank you so much.

121
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,440
I'll study my heart out.

122
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:30,870
Thank you.

123
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,240
Have a good one, Teacher.

124
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,280
Bye-bye.

125
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,800
A mass M with volume V
is released into a deep cup of water,

126
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,920
- right?
- Yes.

127
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,720
It'd look like this,
with a ping-pong ball underneath.

128
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,120
Notice that it's the same.

129
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,400
The only difference is the latter.

130
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,840
Great!

131
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,680
Awesome!

132
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,160
Have I kept you waiting?

133
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,080
Hey, Claire!

134
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,750
I went and got the clothes, guys.

135
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,200
I think I can do this.

136
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,120
Cool!

137
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,400
Cheers!

138
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,640
You guys are so funny.

139
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,320
Thank you.

140
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,640
You've gotten so much better, Cream.

141
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,310
At this rate,

142
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,280
you're sure to get the quota spot.

143
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,320
Thank you, Teacher.

144
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,240
Cream, do you know that...

145
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,120
of all the students I've taught,

146
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,200
you're the most beautiful.

147
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,200
Thank you.

148
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,680
Teacher...

149
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,040
This is a bit too close.

150
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,880
I've helped you.

151
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,840
Please don't do this.

152
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,080
Please return the favor.

153
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,640
Stay still.

154
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,200
Help!

155
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,780
Help me!

156
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,560
I told you to stay still.

157
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,160
Get back!

158
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,520
Go away!

159
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,920
- Who is it?
- This song...

160
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,800
It's Cream.

161
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,720
- Cream?
- Who is it?

162
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,160
Oh, it's my sister.

163
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,880
What is it, Cream?

164
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,680
- Hey, where are you going, Claire?
- Claire?

165
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,720
Claire!

166
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,960
Hello, Cream?

167
00:14:44,112 --> 00:14:44,812
Cream!

168
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,040
Cream!

169
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,440
Cream!

170
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,520
D*mn it!

171
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,760
Cream!

172
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,800
Claire...

173
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,400
Cream!

174
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,600
Claire...

175
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,280
I killed him.

176
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,470
He tried to sexually assault me.

177
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:21,600
I did it to defend myself.

178
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,120
I didn't mean to do it...

179
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:23,920
It's okay.

180
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,360
I'll call the cops.

181
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,800
Claire!

182
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,480
Don't do it, please.

183
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,600
Please.

184
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,800
Don't call the police, please.

185
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,680
Please, can we...

186
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,520
Can we keep it a secret?

187
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,080
I don't want anybody
to find out about this.

188
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,300
Please?

189
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,640
Please.

190
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,960
He sexually assaulted me.

191
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,160
Please, help me, Claire.

192
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,040
Please, get me out of this.

193
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,600
Go home without me, okay?

194
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,640
I'll deal with this myself.

195
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,680
What are you going to do?

196
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,800
But you have to promise me

197
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,680
you won't tell this to anyone,

198
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,280
including Mom, Dad,

199
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,680
your close friends, or anybody.

200
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,280
Keep your lips sealed.

201
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Understood?

202
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,120
Promise me that
this stays between us sisters.

203
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,880
Cream!

204
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,560
Promise?

205
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,480
I promise.

206
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,640
Listen to me.

207
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,560
You're a good girl...

208
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,840
You have a bright future ahead of you.

209
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,440
Study hard...

210
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,080
Make Mom and Dad proud.

211
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,120
Understood?

212
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,480
What are you going to do?

213
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,280
It's time to leave.

214
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,080
Cream.

215
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,840
Don't forget our promise.

216
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,880
I'll see you soon.

217
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,520
How's it going?

218
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,520
Are you alright? You look a bit off.

219
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,640
The dead teacher's sister
came to talk to me.

220
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,800
She then showed me a photo of Cream.

221
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,640
Everyone must have known

222
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,040
who my sister is.

223
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,480
How did she know?

224
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,040
I should be the one asking you.

225
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,440
What do you mean?

226
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,680
You're the only one
I talked to about my sister,

227
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,760
and then it suddenly spread around.

228
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,280
Wait.

229
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,320
You think I spread the news about her?

230
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,360
Then who else could it be?

231
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,760
Not long ago, you were on the phone.

232
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:29,800
Claire...

233
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,080
I didn't tell anyone.

234
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,760
Why would I do that?

235
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Who were you talking to?

236
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,320
I called my attorney.

237
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,000
I wanted a new one.

238
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,240
You don't trust me?

239
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,870
I just thought

240
00:21:52,892 --> 00:21:54,960
it was only my sister
and I who knew it.

241
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,720
After I told you about it,

242
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,760
- then...
- Enough.

243
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,400
I don't want to be hurt anymore.

244
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,360
You shouldn't have f*cking told me.

245
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,840
Where have Mathusorn
and Karakade gone?

246
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,960
I haven't seen them at all lately.

247
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,080
Kae is probably with them,
asking the inmates to repay the money.

248
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,430
By the way, Mangpor,

249
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,040
when will the new stock arrive?

250
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,040
There.

251
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:54,710
Huh?

252
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,200
You already dropped it off?

253
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,720
I thought it'd be
at the end of the month.

254
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,000
I'm not talking about the stock.

255
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,800
It's the Rabid Dog.

256
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,480
She must've found out
the news about her sister.

257
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,760
It's Kae who spread the news.
I wasn't part of it.

258
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,800
- Don't do it!
- Please, don't!

259
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,880
- Hey!
- Come with me.

260
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,680
Wait...

261
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,560
What did you hear?

262
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,080
- I've done nothing!
- Silence!

263
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,560
Shut your mouth.

264
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,400
Just nod and play along.

265
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,320
Did she take the wrong person?

266
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,160
Shut the door.

267
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,920
- Hey, you're not allowed in this area!
- How did you get here?

268
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,320
- You can't be here!
- Leave now!

269
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,120
- Out!
- I told you to leave!

270
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,320
Hey, what the hell?!

271
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,160
Hey! I told you that
you're not allowed!

272
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,960
After them!

273
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,640
Don't let them go!

274
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,720
I actually don't want to be here.

275
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,040
Incoming!

276
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,600
The horse is climbing your leg!

277
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,680
What the hell is going on?!

278
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,000
I've talked to inmate Mangpor.

279
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,000
This month, I'm selling the products
from the prison myself.

280
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,600
Right?

281
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,800
Are you crazy?

282
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,680
How can you be sure you can do it?

283
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,720
It's none of your business.

284
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,080
Or do you want me to expose you, too?

285
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,790
What the hell do you want?

286
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:23,000
Let me sell
the products instead of her.

287
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,840
I want permission to leave.

288
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,400
I only ask for this one time,

289
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,720
then I'll behave

290
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,720
and won't cause any more trouble.

291
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,840
Cause no more trouble?

292
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,240
You already have.

293
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,760
The reports
about Pa'Porn's Alzheimer's...

294
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,000
Do you know how much trouble
I'm in because of it?

295
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,280
And you still dare ask me
to go outside?

296
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,600
All I ask for is this one time.

297
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,040
If I let you leave,

298
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,440
then you'll try running away.

299
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,280
Don't you dare beg me for anything

300
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,600
because I'll never allow it.

301
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,440
I'll also give you
an increased sentence

302
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,840
so that you'll stay here until you die.

303
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,400
Do you think
you can just barge in here

304
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,240
and hope you get what you want?

305
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,320
You're f*cking insane.

306
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,160
It's impossible.

307
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,260
Let go!

308
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,880
Sh*t...

309
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,760
Let me go!

310
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:24,810
D*mn it.

311
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,200
Put her in the hole for a month,

312
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,640
so she doesn't fly off the handle.

313
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,550
Wouldn't that be too long?

314
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,000
Obey my f*cking order!

315
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,880
Let go of me!

316
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,640
- I told you to f*cking let go!
- Move!

317
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,680
You b*stard!

318
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,800
Let me f*cking go!

319
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,000
- Move!
- Let go!

320
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,920
Hands off.

321
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,040
Let me f*cking go, you b*stard!

322
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,440
Let me go out!

323
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,960
- Let go!
- Enough!

324
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,640
Let me go!

325
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,800
F*cking let go!

326
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,720
Let go!

327
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,840
- Let go!
- She's so strong!

328
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,600
- Hey, get in!
- Let me go!

329
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,040
She's so d*mn strong!

330
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,240
Hey, quickly!

331
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,480
Gosh...

332
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,200
She's impossibly strong.

333
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,080
- Let me go!
- Whoa!

334
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,200
Kae.

335
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,400
Hm?

336
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,000
Claire knew about her sister.

337
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,720
That's why she went mad
and punched Wichai in the face.

338
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,840
She's being locked up
alone for a month.

339
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,160
For a month?

340
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,520
Good.

341
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,320
This means she's no longer in my way.

342
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,400
She won't know that

343
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,200
we're behind this, right?

344
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,320
Don't be afraid of her.

345
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,280
Claire

346
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,720
isn't as scary as we thought.

347
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,400
Done?

348
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,160
That's all you have for me?

349
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,120
Let me go!

350
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,080
Let me out!

351
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,040
I told you to f*cking let me out!

352
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,480
Out!

353
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,680
Let me go!

354
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,840
F*cking let me go!

355
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,960
Let go!

356
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,960
Let me f*cking go!

357
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,120
Sis, I'm hungry.

358
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,400
Sis, I'm hungry...

359
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,560
Sis...

360
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,800
I'm hungry, sis.

361
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,640
D*mn it, Karakade!

362
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,640
Eat properly, please.

363
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,840
F*cking disgusting.

364
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,480
Do you want some?

365
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,680
Oh?

366
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,240
I want a loan.

367
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,560
Are you for real?

368
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,040
Hey, Kae...

369
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,360
What should we do?

370
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,520
Your roommate
wants to take a loan from us.

371
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,720
Go ahead.

372
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,960
The interest rate is 20%.

373
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,560
Repay us on payday.

374
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,560
Pay it in one go.

375
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,880
How much do you want?

376
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,780
Three thousand baht.

377
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,280
Why do you need that much money?

378
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,440
None of your business.

379
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,720
- Hey, you want trouble, don't you?
- Duen.

380
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,040
Don't hurt our client.

381
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,120
When she can't afford to repay...

382
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,160
we can deal with her later.

383
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,400
Sis!

384
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,360
Can I have a loan, please?

385
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,480
You're talking too much.

386
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,560
Hey, sis!

387
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,880
I'm stuck.

388
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,040
I can't get my head out.

389
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:47,920
It hurts!

390
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,760
Guards! My head is bleeding!

391
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,920
- Help me.
- I'm helping.

392
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,080
Don't help her.

393
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,920
Sis, I'm stuck!

394
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,880
I'll leave this to you, okay?

395
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,880
That's a lot.

396
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,440
Can you afford to repay them?

397
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,440
Fast!

398
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,840
Faster!

399
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,760
Hey, is this as fast as you can go?

400
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,840
Faster!

401
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,240
Come on! Faster!

402
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,720
Yeah.

403
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,480
Bell.

404
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:54,280
You can have the bags
of soil and fertilizer,

405
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,240
rose seeds,
and gardening tools right away.

406
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,200
The rest of your stuff
is in the library.

407
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,600
Thank you, Mangpor.

408
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,880
Mm, don't mention it.

409
00:32:59,583 --> 00:33:02,933
[Bell]

410
00:33:02,957 --> 00:33:05,047
[Claire]

411
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,320
Kung!

412
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,240
Kung!

413
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,000
Kung!

414
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,360
I'm out of liquor, Kung!

415
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,240
Kung! Kung!

416
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,800
Kung!

417
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:16,680
I miss you so much!

418
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,120
Where have you been?!

419
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,360
I'm out of liquor.

420
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,720
Please fetch some from my dad's.

421
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,560
It's in his room.

422
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,200
- I'm not allowed in Mr. Sutthi's room.
- Well, he's away!

423
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,960
- Please, fetch it for me.
- Yes, Master!

424
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,600
Chop-chop!

425
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,800
You've got this!

426
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,800
Like the wind, Kung!

427
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,280
Left, right, left, right, left, right!

428
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,760
Score!

429
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,360
- Yeah!
- Top.

430
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,440
- Uh...
- Jade, your name means a gemstone.

431
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,760
Jade, your name means a gemstone!

432
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,680
You're here to see Mr. Sutthi?

433
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,320
He's not home. He's overseas.

434
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,240
He's probably going to be away
for a long time.

435
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,600
I'm actually coming to see you, Top.

436
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,320
No, no, no! You're lying.

437
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,200
A person like you only serves my dad!

438
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,360
You didn't come here to see me!

439
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,880
But now that you're here, let's drink!

440
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,240
- Uh...
- Drink!

441
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,320
Top...

442
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,320
There's nobody in the kitchen.

443
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,720
I'm alone and have nobody else.

444
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:21,600
You also put my girlfriend in prison.

445
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,240
That's what I'm actually here for.

446
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,240
Right.

447
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:25,920
Right!

448
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,160
Ah...

449
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,040
You're spying on me or something?

450
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,360
The picture is so old, bro!

451
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,100
Found it!

452
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,200
Alright, let's go.

453
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,840
Right now...

454
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,560
- Right.
- They...

455
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,920
They're connecting the dots.

456
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,080
They found that people who got charged
for drug abuse at the bar

457
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:02,320
were your friends.

458
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,240
To put it simply,

459
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,800
the evidence is clear that
you were there at the bar.

460
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,320
Aside from that, though...

461
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,080
People online
somehow discovered that...

462
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,680
your confiscated car key
mysteriously went missing.

463
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,720
Just get to the point already, brother.

464
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:26,040
Soon, they'll be able
to trace everything back to you.

465
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,280
- Right.
- However...

466
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,240
You still have a way out.

467
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,240
This will also get Bell out of prison.

468
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,120
But you might have to cut ties

469
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,040
with your friends.

470
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,040
Uh...

471
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,160
Thank you. I'm actually hungry.

472
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,280
I want to give this to her and leave.

473
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,040
This is a restricted area.

474
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,440
You're not allowed to enter.

475
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,800
She has to stay there for a long time.

476
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,360
I think she's probably losing her mind.

477
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,160
At least...

478
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,320
Can you give this to her?

479
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,560
This will make her know that

480
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,240
someone's waiting for her,
even though she's in there alone.

481
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,560
I cannot allow that either.

482
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,840
Your lunch.

483
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,400
I think you're going to enjoy this.

484
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,280
I'll never tell your secret to anyone.

485
00:39:50,405 --> 00:39:52,505
Because I really care about you.

486
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,360
Please stop being mad at me

487
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,960
and come out soon, okay?

488
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,960
I'm waiting for you.

489
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,240
Bell, I can't do this anymore.

490
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,240
Are you alright?

491
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,320
Wait...

492
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,080
I'll help.

493
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,080
Thank you. It must've been heavy.

494
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,480
Don't forget to repay me, alright?

495
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,640
Mm...

496
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,880
It's time to pay up, Bell.

497
00:41:40,157 --> 00:41:42,157
[Claire]

498
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,800
I haven't done any work at all,

499
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,520
so I don't have any income.

500
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,600
Everybody says that.

501
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,840
Can I at least pay the interest first?

502
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,400
The principal is 3,000 baht,

503
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,920
so 20% of that is 600 baht.

504
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,240
I demand you pay the whole amount.

505
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,800
I don't accept small payments.

506
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,120
The total amount
isn't 3,000 baht either.

507
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,280
It's 9,000 baht.

508
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,200
It includes the bribe money that let
you attend your dad's funeral...

509
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,720
and your new shoes.

510
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,920
If so, I can't repay you.

511
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,240
- You have...
- Don't give her time.

512
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,560
You dare interrupt me?

513
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,600
Yeah, so what?

514
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,200
She said she had no money.

515
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,000
Just collect the "interest" from her

516
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,400
the same way you do with the others.

517
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,280
It's not that difficult.

518
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,600
You told us
not to lay our fingers on her.

519
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,200
I've already withdrawn that condition.

520
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,200
Claire is going to kill you all.

521
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,120
Let me tell you girls something.

522
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,440
Don't be afraid of Claire.

523
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,960
She's just an insane person.

524
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,360
She's never actually killed a person.

525
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,640
She's only serving
the sentence for her sister.

526
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,200
What the hell are you saying?

527
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,880
Surprised?

528
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,760
I'm actually the one
spreading the news about her sister.

529
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,200
I eavesdropped on everything
you two talked about

530
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,640
and saw everything you did there.

531
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,600
Why are you doing this?

532
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,520
Because you two hurt my feelings.

533
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,800
That's why I want my revenge.

534
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,600
Can't I do that?

535
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,240
What are you waiting for?

536
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,360
Make her pay.

537
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,200
Don't be afraid of Claire.

538
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,440
Mathusorn.

539
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:58,640
Karakade.

540
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,960
Lock her arms.

541
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,840
- Hey! Hey!
- Let me go.

542
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,120
Come here!

543
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,440
Stay still!

544
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,040
Don't move.

545
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,480
Teach her a lesson,

546
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,360
so she learns.

547
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,280
Why can't I interrupt you, huh?

548
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,480
What should we do?

549
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,960
That's enough. She's gonna die.

550
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Let's go, girls.

551
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,160
Come on, let's move.

552
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,080
After her.

553
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,160
- Come on!
- May I ask for an interview?

554
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,040
D*mn it.

555
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,600
Can I please have an interview?

556
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,520
- May I ask for an interview?
- Natty.

557
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,240
There is news reporting that

558
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,840
- you're part of a murder case.
- Calm down, everyone.

559
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,640
- What are your thoughts on this?
- Calm down, everybody.

560
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:00,680
Please calm down.

561
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,080
- Please step back.
- Do you have anything to say?

562
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,080
Can we please have an interview?

563
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:08,830
Hey!

564
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,120
You!

565
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,320
This way!

566
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:12,720
Hurry!

567
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:13,640
Get in!

568
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,680
Stop!

569
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:15,640
Quickly!

570
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:16,960
Come on, get in!

571
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,960
- Can I have an interview?
- After her!

572
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Please wait!

573
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,360
May we ask for an interview?

574
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,440
Please wait!

575
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,440
Natty, please wait!

576
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,800
- Natty!
- Natty!

577
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,040
- Can we please have an interview?
- Natty...

578
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,360
Natty.

579
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,680
Feel free to drop me off here.

580
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,200
Thank you so much.

581
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,040
Wait.

582
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,120
Yes?

583
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,000
Remember, we've met before?

584
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,000
We were there
to visit the same inmate

585
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,360
whose name is Claire.

586
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,440
Wait, don't leave!

587
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,960
- Talk to me.
- Let me go!

588
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,360
I'm done talking!

589
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,120
Hey!

590
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,440
You're free.

591
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,640
The roses are blooming just in time
to welcome you back.

592
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:11,240
I've been changing the fertilizer,

593
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,040
using compost
and manure back and forth.

594
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,200
I've also been watering them daily.

595
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:18,880
Who did this to you?

596
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:21,560
Was it Deedee's girls?

597
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,440
Or was it Kae?

598
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,440
Claire!

599
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:36,780
Don't do it!

600
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,120
Please don't.

601
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:41,400
I don't want to lose you again.

602
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,160
Please, I beg you.

603
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,520
- Wait...
- Duen.

604
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:14,640
Over there.

605
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,360
Don't be scared of her.

606
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,480
She's never actually killed anyone.

607
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,440
I know you're behind
all this sh*tty stuff,

608
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,320
including the news about my sister

609
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,920
and how Bell got hurt.

610
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:57,680
Do you know

611
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,080
what Bell told me?

612
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
She told me not to do anything to you,

613
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:07,560
even after all that you did to her.

614
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,120
From now on,

615
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:18,880
don't mess with Bell
and me ever again.

616
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,360
Or else, the first person I kill

617
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,160
will be you.

618
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,240
Got it?

619
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,640
And about the money Bell owed you,

620
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:54,280
I'll find the money
and repay you myself.

621
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,400
See? I warned you.

622
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,840
It doesn't matter if she has

623
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:10,880
or hasn't killed anyone,

624
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,240
she's still the Rabid Dog.

625
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,880
You're so f*cking dumb.

626
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:17,760
F*ck off!

627
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,200
How dare you f*cking say that to me?!

628
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:21,360
- How could you say that?!
- So what?

629
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,290
So what?!

630
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:23,520
- Let me go!
- Get off me!

631
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:25,240
From now on,

632
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:28,400
I'm fully taking over the business.

633
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:29,520
You dare do that?

634
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:30,560
Yeah!

635
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,240
Turn around and ask your underlings.

636
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,160
Just f*cking look at them!

637
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,880
Let me ask you this.

638
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,240
What the f*ck do you even do in a day?

639
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,440
The money
funding the business is mine.

640
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:48,960
When the payment's due,

641
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,200
Karakade and Mathusorn
handle collecting.

642
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:54,040
Those who do more
deserve to be paid more.

643
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,840
Those who do less
deserve to be paid f*cking less!

644
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:57,720
Kae!

645
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:01,360
You piece of sh*t...

646
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:02,840
You're such an a**hole.

647
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,360
What did you say?

648
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,840
Don't hurt my sister!

649
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,480
Without Dao and Wichai,

650
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,240
it kinda feels empty, huh?

651
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:24,640
Don't f*cking do it, Kae!

652
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:25,640
What?

653
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:26,360
Let her go!

654
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,960
Are you going to cry?

655
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,200
Don't f*cking touch her!

656
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,880
I told you to stop!

657
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:35,680
Kae!

658
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:42,120
Kae! You b*stard!

659
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,400
- Kae!
- What the f*ck do you want, huh?

660
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:50,840
Are you alright?

661
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,560
How dare you do this to me?

662
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:56,960
I'm really sorry.

663
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,160
Don't say f*cking sorry!

664
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,240
Go f*cking away!

665
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,720
Get out!

666
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,040
Oh, really?

667
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:07,000
Mr. Elephant, I'm doing well.

668
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:08,440
Have you had anything?

669
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,760
Are you out of your mind?!

670
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,600
You put an inmate
in confinement for a month?

671
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:13,400
Well...

672
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,400
That inmate punched me, sir.

673
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:16,800
Then extend her sentence

674
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:18,080
and file a report.

675
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,800
You can't simply
take action so arbitrarily.

676
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:23,520
Do you understand what humanity is?

677
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,080
You f*cking reported
your punishment to the Director?

678
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,520
Yes.

679
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:52,800
I did it.

680
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,240
That's only the first report
about you, though.

681
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,320
There are still more reports to come

682
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:03,640
from accepting bribe money

683
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,200
and the affair

684
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:07,080
- between...
- Enough. Shut up.

685
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:14,200
What do you want?

686
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,840
Transfer Bell to my cell,

687
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:21,560
and I'll be out of your hair.

688
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:24,160
What else do you want?

689
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:26,760
That's all.

690
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:32,040
Fine.

691
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:10,240
♫There's a problem

[Dao, Duen, Deedee]

705
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:29,520
Have you ever
thought of going outside?

706
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,760
Outside the cell or the prison?

707
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,360
Outside the prison, of course.

708
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:37,520
Um...

709
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:39,920
At first, I did,

710
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,080
but not anymore.

711
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,360
Don't you feel any resentment

712
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:50,080
for serving time for a crime
you didn't commit?

713
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,840
It's what I've chosen,

714
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:59,800
so I have to accept the consequences.

715
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:01,900
What about you?

716
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,920
Ever since I got to stay here,

717
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:07,520
it's been bad for me.

718
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,640
I haven't been able
to sleep that well at all.

719
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,840
All I feel is paranoia.

720
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:19,640
However, I do hope that
there's a way to turn my case around.

721
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:22,520
I want to get out of here so badly.

722
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:27,760
What if I never get to be free?

723
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:33,560
Why did you say that?

724
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:39,200
I've exchanged my life for my sister's.

725
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:45,320
If my freedom

726
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:50,520
meant she had to be
locked up here instead...

727
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:55,560
I just can't accept that.

♫Just hold me tight♫

740
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:11,560
♫No matter how dark the night is,♫

741
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:15,120
♫You're like the star
that lights up my sky♫

742
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:32,300
♫No matter how dark the night is,♫

743
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:36,300
♫You're like the star
that lights up my sky♫
