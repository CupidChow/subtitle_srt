00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,520
What an ugly nail job!

8
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,800
Gosh, you're so whiny.

9
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,480
- Why don't you go to a nail salon instead?
- They...

10
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,140
Hey!

11
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,760
I have to...

12
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,400
- Hey! Don't push!
- My nails must dry first.

13
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,760
Blow them dry for me.

14
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,600
Come on. That won't make them dry.

15
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,320
You've still got newspapers?

16
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,040
How old school!

17
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,640
Oh, they're Dad's old newspapers.

18
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,680
We didn't know where to put them,

19
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,920
so we put them here for now.

20
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,680
Whoa, do you guys remember this headline?

21
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Hey, I do!

22
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,600
It was a huge one.

23
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,280
A girl sneaked into a school
and stole a computer.

24
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,240
- Then she stabbed a teacher to death.
- Oh...

25
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,760
She then waited for the cops
to show up and arrest her.

26
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,240
That's scary.

00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,160

Yeah, that's the one.

30
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,800
- Beautiful!
- Did you take a photo?

31
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,550
I did!

32
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,280
Oh, I have to remove the nail polish.

33
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,960
Gotta feed my dad,

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I don't want any polish in his food.

35
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,040
Okay.

36
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,040
Hey, Bell.

37
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,360
19-Stab Claire is going to
remove the nail polish for you!

38
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,500
Bye, Dad.

39
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,480
We're leaving now.

40
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,640
It's okay, Auay.

41
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,680
I'll take it from here.

'Petch Pra Uma.'

43
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,800

Why did you stop?

51
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,140
I was on the edge of my seat.

52
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,440
We'll be back after a quick break.

53
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,400
Rapin Praiwan must have his meal first!

00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,440
My academic gown is here.

55
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,680
After the meal,

56
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,600
how about I get changed,
and we take a photo together?

57
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,360
Dad!

58
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,400
Your beautiful daughter is here.

59
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,080
Excuse me, dad.

60
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,280
It's okay.

61
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,120
You look amazing today.

62
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,640
How are you already in the backyard?

63
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,440
Ready?

64
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,920
One more?

65
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,520
10 more, please.

66
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,440
Can you do 10 more photos?

67
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,520
I can.

68
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,280
Congratulations.

69
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,640
You didn't have to give me this.

70
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,320
Don't be so considerate.

71
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,240
It's just a necklace, not that expensive.

72
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,760
With you paying my tuition,

73
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,600
I don't know how I'll be able to repay you,

74
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,360
let alone Auay's service fee.

75
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,200
Here. Let me put it on for you.

76

Hey, Top!

77
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,040
Welcome, bro!

78
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,480
This is Tang, my girlfriend.

79
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,360
Hi.

80
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,240
This is Dream.

81
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,880
This is Bell,

82
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,240
- Top's girlfriend.
- She's my girlfriend.

83
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,560
Just sit down already.

84
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,120
Alright! Drink up!

85
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,400
To Bell!

86
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,640
Congratulations!

87
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,360
Hand me your shot glass
if you want some more!

88
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,560
Alright, alright!

89
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,720
What do you think of my friends?

90
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,680
They're good company.

91
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,960
Do you like them?

92
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,000
Hey, guys!

93
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,160
Let's dance at the front.

94
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,040
Let's go!

95
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,280
- Top, you go and dance.
- Please.

96
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,560
Come and dance with me. Just once.

97
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,600
Let's go!

98
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,800
- Come on.
- I'm bad at dancing.

99
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,600
Quick!

100
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,040
It's just for fun.

101
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,800
Come on.

102
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,440
Hey, bro!

103
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,560
Top!

104
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,880
You're completely hammered.

105
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,520
The car key...

106
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,960
Leave it with me for now.

107
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,720
I'm going to the bathroom, okay?

108
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,560
Mm.

109
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,920
Do you want me to come with you?

110
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,960
It's fine.

111
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,320
Just dance and be with your friends.

112
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,240
- I can go there by myself.
- Okay.

113
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,760
Hello?

114
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,240
Hi, Dad.

115
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,800
Where are you?

116
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,840
Your voice sounds so echoey.

117
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,340
I'm at a nightclub.

118
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,240
Top took me to a graduation party.

119
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,760
Mm. Don't be late, okay?

120
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,600
I'll be home soon.

121
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,000
Don't worry, Dad.

122
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,680
I love you, Dad.

123
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,030
Mm.

124
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,840
I love you, too, dear.

125
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,040
Beam!

126
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,280
Where's Top?

127
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,840
I'll be right back, okay?

128
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,160
Beam, where's Top?

129
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,320
I'll be back.

130
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,200
Hello, Bell.

131
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,000
Where are you?

132
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,640
Someone called the cops on the nightclub.

133
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,280
We're all outside.

134
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,120
You should...

135
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,440
Meet me at my car.

136
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,760
Leave as quickly as you can!

137
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,520
Where's my car key?!

138
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,240
The car key's with me.

139
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,280
Top! Hurry!

140
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,400
My arms are killing me!

141
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,520
Come on!

142
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,480
This way!

143
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,360
Top?

144
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,360
My bag is full of drugs.

145
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,480
- Huh?!
- Ow!

146
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,040
How?!

147
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,920
I don't know.

148
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,200
What do I do?

149
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,880
Someone must have slipped them in

150
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,400
when you went to the bathroom.

151
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,680
What do you want me to do?

152
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,840
Should I give them to the cops?

153
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,000
Hold on, Bell.

154
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,080
I don't think that's a good idea.

155
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,720
What am I supposed to do?!

156
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,280
Pull yourself together.

157
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,520
Let me think for a second.

158
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,400
Top!

159
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,360
Hold up.

160
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,040
Give me a second.

161
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,880
I'm back!

162
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,920
Watch me.

163
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,960
Let's go, dude!

164
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,240
Here's the plan.

165
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,880
Throw them away.

166
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,120
They're in your handbag.

167
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,640
If you don't throw them away,

168
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,200
you'll be in big trouble
if the cops find out.

169
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,960
How would you explain yourself?

170
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,040
Hey, miss.

171
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,040
What are you doing?

172
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,800
Sergeant,

173
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,040
- search everything.
- Yes, sir!

174
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,520
Lieutenant...

175
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,080
They're not mine.

176
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,400
Whose are they then?

177
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,960
They're not mine.

178
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,560
Someone stuffed them in my handbag.

179
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,040
They're actually not mine.

180
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,800
How's that possible, huh?

181
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,040
You're the only person here.

182
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,200
How could they not be yours?!

183
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,560
They're not mine.

184
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,360
- Sergeant, arrest her.
- Top!

185
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,000
Top! Help me!

186
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,240
Top!

187
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,200
Bell!

188
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,320
- Bell!
- Top, come here!

189
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,560
- Hands off!
- Damn it, Top!

190
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,960
- Top!
- Come here!

191
00:11:59,240 --> 00:11:59,840
Hands behind your back.

192
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,800
Top!

193
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,160
- Please listen to me!
- Hands behind your back.

194
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,480
- Top!
- Top, listen to me.

195
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,760
Calm down.

196
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,880
Stand still.

197
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,920
Top!

198
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,440
Move it!

199
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,280
What are you waiting for?

200
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,440
Hurry! Come on!

201
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,640
[Restricted Area]

202
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,760
Move it!

203
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,880
Hurry.

204
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,240
Come on! Move it!

205
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,200
I told you to move it!

206
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,240
Why are you so slow?!

207
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,440
Come on.

208
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,160
One at a time.

209
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,560
Row number three.

210
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,280
Halt.

211
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,800
You're the one with the drug case.

212
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,960
Go.

213
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,320
Take off your clothes!

214
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:19,960
Now!

215
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,720
Are you really going to cause trouble
right on the first day?

216
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,000
Quickly!

217
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:32,240
[Lalita Pianmas]

218
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,800
My name is Wichai,

219
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,080
the warden of this prison.

220
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,240
If you want to live comfortably,

221
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,080
obey the rules.

222
00:15:48,446 --> 00:15:50,446
And the prison director

223
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,440
will leave you alone.

224
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,400
If there's anything

225
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,800
or something you want,

226
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,160
just tell me.

227
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,680
If you're not able to talk to me,

228
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,840
you can always talk to the female guards.

229
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,000
I want you to remember that

230
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,920
being imprisoned is meant

231
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,680
to make you feel the weight of your actions.

232
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,680
Therefore, use your time here

233
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,760
to reflect on your wrongdoings

234
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,880
and become better people,

235
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,640
so that once you're free,

236
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,400
you won't be back here again.

237
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,760
Understood?

238
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,720
Understood?!

239
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,200
Understood!

240
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,360
Come here, girl.

241
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,880
Come here.

242
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,880
This way.

243
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:53,680
- Aw, this new girl looks so lost.
- Hey!

244
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,040
What's up, girl?

245
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,040
- So cute.
- Don't forget to come and see me.

246
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,320
- She's so my type.
- Worth another arrest.

247
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,440
- I'm here for you, girl.
- Yeah.

248
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,400
Get inside.

249
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,560
What are you doing?

250
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,360
I'm putting my stuff on the bed.

251
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,880
You're a new kid.

252
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,360
You can't sleep on that bed.

253
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,760
Yours is the upper one.

254
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,100
What's your name?

255
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,440
Bell.

256
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,000
Bell?

257
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,240
Kinda rhymes with jail, doesn't it?

258
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,600
Jail?

259
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,440
Your name's Bell,

260
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,040
and this is a jail.

261
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,320
Bell and jail...

262
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,240
That rhymes.

263
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,800
Hey!

264
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,040
That was just a joke.

265
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,160
I was just teasing you!

266
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,720
Oh, sorry.

267
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,480
Give me a second.

268
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,360
I'm Kae.

269
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,080
You're lucky that I'm your cellmate.

270
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,760
I'm kind,

271
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,800
gentle,

272
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,920
and very sweet.

273
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,760
And...

274
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,920
What crime did you commit?

275
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,280
Possession of drugs.

276
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,040
Right...

277
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,200
A very common one.

278
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,360
Don't you want to know

279
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,400
what my charge is?

280
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,600
Oh, uh...

281
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,280
- What crime did you commit?
- Make a guess!

282
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,200
Possession of drugs?

283
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,280
I have this medicine,

284
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,680
so you think I'm a drug addict

285
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,560
or a dealer, right?

286
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,000
No, it's not like that.

287
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,640
I just thought that
we're in the same cell because

288
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,840
we have the same charge.

289
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,040
I'm not trying to throw shade at you.

290
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,080
I was saying nonsense.

291
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,280
Hey!

292
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,640
You look as pale as a ghost!

293
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,160
I was joking, you know?

294
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,120
Here. Have a seat.

295
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,480
Come on!

296
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,760
We've got jobs to do here, by the way.

297
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,040
The harder you work,
the more you'll get paid.

298
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,680
The less you do, the less you'll get paid.

299
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,440
The earnings you receive

300
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,200
can be either credits you spend here

301
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,680
or actual payment once you're free.

302
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,920
Those two...

303
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,120
One of them is Dao.

304
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,480
She's the big dog

305
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,640
and the boss of the inmates.

306
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,920
She basically rules everything here.

307
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,240
She's extremely fierce.

308
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,680
Slacking off?

309
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,360
That's all you've done since early morning?

310
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,960
What the fuck have you been doing?!

311
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,840
- Shit!
- Work!

312
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,840
[May you work hard]

313
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,280
Inmates, she's just an example.

314
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,280
You're here to goddamn work.

315
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,240
This is just a bottle of antihistamines.

316
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,120
I have a dust allergy,

317
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,400
and it's very dusty here.

318
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,840
I also have to take the same medicine.

319
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,760
I have a shellfish allergy.

320
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,520
Oh, what a coincidence.

321
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,160
So we're both just as weak.

322
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,800
Actually...

323
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,920
Two years isn't that long.

324
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,600
If you know how to make friends and be social,

325
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,720
this place isn't as bad as you think.

326
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,000
Look, look, look!

327
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,200
There it is.

328
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,320
See that?

329
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,120
It's Pa'Porn's greenhouse.

330
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,240
Who is she?

331
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,480
She's just a kind-hearted elderly inmate.

332
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,280
She loves gardening and tending to the plants.

333
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,720
That's why she often comes to the greenhouse.

334
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,160
What plants has she got there?

335
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,720
Bell.

336
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,760
I don't think you should go there.

337
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,640
Aside from Pa'Porn,

338
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,080
no one else dares to enter the greenhouse.

339
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,640
It's too dangerous.

340
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,440
The Rabid Dog also prefers this place.

341
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:05,360
[Restricted Area]

342
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,520
That's mine!

343
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,440
Give me!

344
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,560
What are we having today?

345
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,920
Whoa, it's nothing but wax gourd.

346
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,160
Out of the way, Auntie.

347
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,540
Hand me your tray.

348
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,520
Your spoon, too.

349
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,800
Give me more.

350
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,080
She's part of the 3Ds.

351
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,480
Who are the 3Ds?

352
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,440
There.

353
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,160
That's Dao.

354
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,120
Aside from being everyone's boss,

355
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,640
she's also the biggest sister of the 3Ds gang.

356
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,960
And the girl eating next to her?

357
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,240
That's Duen,

358
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,680
Dao's younger sister.

359
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,560
She always does the boss's bidding.

360
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,760
And the last D there,

361
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,840
she's a fierce one.

362
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,440
That tough-looking girl is

363
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,880
Deedee.

364
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,600
- Yes.
- Despite her looks,

365
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,880
she's a troublemaker.

366
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,480
She loves getting into fights with others.

367
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,560
If you were to run into them,

368
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,400
be careful, okay?

369
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,280
And...

370
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,240
What's the origin behind the name?

371
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,320
Dao, Duen, and Deedee.

372
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,480
That's three names
starting with letter D, so it's 3Ds.

373
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,560
- Oi, Karakade?
- Yes?

374
00:23:22,593 --> 00:23:23,593
Where's the eyebrow pencil?

375
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,640
- Oh...
- From Mangpor. Is it here?

376
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,920
The new batch has arrived.

377
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,600
Always buying nothing but bits and pieces.

378
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,680
It's stuff for the beautiful.

379
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,040
You'll never get it, Dao.

380
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,280
What were you laughing at?

381
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,440
Well...

382
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,000
Deedee called you ugly.

383
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,640
I already knew that.

384
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,280
I got dumber because
you kept slapping my head.

385
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,640
You've always been this way.

386
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,000
You wanted to see me, Dao?

387
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,560
Someone told me

388
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,680
you stole a piece of candy from the shop?

389
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,840
I...

390
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,920
Pa'Porn always gave me free candies.

391
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,080
I didn't know,

392
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,320
so I thought I could just get one for free.

393
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,120
I'm now in charge of the shop.

394
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,160
Not Pa'Porn anymore!

395
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,280
There are no such things as freebies.

396
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,240
All of you, listen up!

397
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,080
How many pieces did you take?

398
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,520
I took three of them,

399
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,840
but I only ate one.

400
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,800
- I...
- I don't accept returns.

401
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,280
Duen.

402
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:48,800
Hey.

403
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,600
Let's go, girls.

404
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,800
- Grab her tight.
- What a waste of fucking time.

405
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,440
3 pieces, right?

406
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,160
That's one.

407
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,200
That's two.

408
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,240
Stop.

409
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,560
You may go now.

410
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,840
I'm so sorry!

411
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,740
Who's that girl sitting with Kae?

412
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,560
Oh...

413
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,760
It's the new inmate.

414
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,400
She's Kae's cellmate.

415
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,800
Treating her like a princess.

416
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,880
I bet she wants to claim the new kid.

417
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,640
Snacks are on me.

418
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,240
Thank you.

419
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,000
What do you have in mind?

420
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,000
Back then, it was Pa'Porn
who was in charge of this shop.

421
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,200
She was so generous.

422
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,560
She'd give candies as freebies.

423
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:27,990
Apparently, she was too kind.

424
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,560
She gave away too many freebies,
so sales went down.

425
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,280
Once Wichai found out,

426
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,520
she got chewed out
and transferred to another job.

427
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,280
Since then,

428
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,720
Wichai assigned the 3Ds to the shop.

429
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,600
Seeing a shop in a prison

430
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,200
is kind of weird, isn't it?

431
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,760
You can actually find almost anything here,
just like outside.

432
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
There are only two things
that you can't find here.

433
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:54,960
What are they?

434
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,120
Freedom and happiness.

435
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,920
That didn't sound cool, did it?

436
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,280
It did.

437
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,200
Treating yourself to some tasty treats

438
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,840
is a simple joy for the inmates.

439
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,640
It's just a shame that

440
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,960
the money doesn't go to the prison,

441
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,700
or else the quality of life
would have improved.

442
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,520
Then where does the money go?

443
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,560
You were once stationed at a detention center.

444
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,880
Why did you leave?

445
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,800
[Women's detention center]

446
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,040
When I was working there...

447
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,840
The youths were just as bad as the adults.

448
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,360
Some were even worse.

449
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,760
They needed discipline

450
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,440
and punishment so that they'd remember.

451
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,960
However, the authorities
didn't have much power

452
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,520
due to one reason:

453
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,320
they were just kids.

454
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,040
Ultimately, they'd get set free

455
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,320
only to grow up and become
full-grown prisoners.

456
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,200
I believe that

457
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,520
punishment,

458
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,040
and strict probation,

459
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,760
are tools for changing people for the better.

460
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,080
I also believe that
this facility suits me better.

461
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,080
Each place has its own set of rules.

462
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,560
For now, adhere to my instructions.

463
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,720
Do not act on your own authority

464
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,560
so that nothing bad

465
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,200
reaches the director.

466
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,780
After that,

467
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,400
we'll find the middle ground.

468
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,360
Understood?

469
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,600
Yes.

470
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,640
Thank you, Warden.

471
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,000
You may leave.

472
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,160
I've already told you

473
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,320
not to come here on your own.

474
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,840
If this gets reported,

475
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,040
do you realize how screwed I'd be?

476
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,640
Who would dare do that?

477
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,120
You made my day.

478
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,240
You remember what I wanted.

479
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,520
I'm being serious here.

480
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,440
Don't do anything risky again.
I don't like it.

481
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,080
I'm sorry. I didn't think it through.

482
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,760
To come to see me...

483
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,320
Is there a problem?

484
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:35,060
Don't tell me that
you're here just for the persimmon.

485
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,200
Can you please submit a request to

486
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,240
reduce Deedee's sentence?

487
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,560
Dao,

488
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,400
I just did that for Duen.

489
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,200
The director hasn't even approved the request.

490
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,800
If I submitted another one,

491
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,240
it'd look suspicious.

492
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,800
Please wait for a while, okay?

493
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,720
Well then...

494
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,640
I'll look into it.

495
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,160
Don't you want to submit
your own request as well?

496
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:30,920
No.

497
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,560
I won't find another
good prisoner like you again, will I?

498
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,040
Queue up if you want some.

499
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,160
Just let it out.

500
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,520

to sort the books by category,

507
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,680
and make sure they don't get stolen.

508

Feel free to look around first if you want.

509
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,640

Oh, she was looking for a book.

Mm.

Do you know that

she won't back down

That's why everybody calls her
'the Rabid Dog.'

from the outside.

Once the stuff arrives,

549
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,520
she'll hide them in several spots.

550
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,880
She'll then tell the inmates
to pick them up later.

551

Why can't she just give it to the inmate?

552
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,920
What? Bell?!

553
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,480
It's to avoid getting set up!

554
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,640
So that there's no evidence to tie her

555
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,840
in case someone rats her out.

556
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,440

00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:14,720
So we just took it.

750
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,120
Yeah, yeah!

751
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,880
I asked her if I could borrow the novel,

752
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,160
and she said yes.

753
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,760
You can have it back.

754
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,880
Let bygones be bygones, right?

755
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:27,920
I'm truly sorry.

756
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,840
"Let bygones be bygones."

757
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:47,120
Let bygones be bygones?

758
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:56,760
Get up.

759
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,200
- Get up!
- Stand up.

760
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,240
Get up.

761
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:00,920
Now.

762
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Here you go.

763
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,040
- Where are you going?!
- Face that way.

764
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,600
- Face towards her, not this way.
- Look at me!

765
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:10,920
Stay still.

766
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,040
Don't you ever steal her shit again!

767
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,480
Satisfied?

768
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,000
- You dare steal in prison?
- Pick her up.

769
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,120
Pay up if you want to look pretty!

770
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,440
Get up!

771
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,480
Come here.

772
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,040
Come out. You're free.

773
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,600
Don't cause more trouble, got it?

774
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:16,360
What's wrong?

775
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,600
I'm hungry.

776
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:39,720
Let's hurry up and go.

777
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,240
Screw it! Leave it.

778
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:02,320
Let's go.

779
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,320
It's okay. We can eat later.

780
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:05,360
Quickly.

781
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,160
Hello!

782
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,200
Your one stupid job is...

783
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,120
to make sure the packages get delivered.

784
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:29,560
If I have a dog to guard the house

785
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:34,560
but it lets a thief in to steal my shit,

786
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:38,840
what should I do to it?

787
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:48,000
Deedee, calm down.

788
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,400
Bell is new here.

789
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,320
She had no clue.

790
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:52,440
We can talk about this.

791
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:53,760
Yeah, agreed.

792
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:55,840
It's probably a misunderstanding.

793
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,080
Yeah.

794
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,280
Aw...

795
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,280
You're protecting each other like lovers.

796
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,200
"Babe!"

797
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,360
If you love each other that much,

798
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:10,120
I'll let the stars decide

799
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:12,440
which one will survive,

800
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,960
and which one will be punished.

801
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,760
Aw, sis...

802
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:28,120
♫The Mon hides the cloth,
the doll's behind you♫

803
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:34,280
♫Put it here, and put it there,
and I'll smack your bottom♫

804
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,160
Oh? You're the lucky one,

805
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:44,800
new inmate.

806
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:51,280
I've been waiting for this.

807
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,120
- Hey!
- Out of the way!

808
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,240
Move!

809
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,120
Where are you going?

810
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:56,640
Bell! Bell!

811
00:54:01,953 --> 00:54:03,673
Where are you going, girl?

812
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:06,240
Move.

813
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:45,640
There's my diva!

814
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,800
Go, queen!

815
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,440
Come on!

816
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Peekaboo!

817
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:24,760
Aw, what should we do?

818
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,800
Want to have some fun, girl?

819
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:39,120
Where are you going, girl?

820
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:55,840
This has nothing to do with you.

821
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:56,880
Move.

822
00:55:58,760 --> 00:55:59,760
Why should I?

823
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:02,120
I haven't eaten.

824
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,080
Let's go.

825
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,080
Dao told us not to mess with her.

826
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:13,840
Fine.

827
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,520
I'll postpone our little game.

828
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:44,520
Eat with me.

829
00:56:46,686 --> 00:56:47,680
I've got too much.

830
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:49,320
Can't finish it all.

831
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:51,600
It'd be a waste.

832
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,200
That's okay.

833
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,360
I can get a tray myself.

834
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,640
Disgusted?

835
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,240
No, not at all.

836
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:01,760
I'm sorry.

837
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,200
I just don't wanna bother you.

838
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:08,120
It's alright.

839
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,280
Join me.

840
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:11,480
Why get another tray?

841
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:19,160
I'm sorry.

842
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,520
How many times are you gonna apologize?

843
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:31,840
I'm waiting.

844
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:34,520
I'm sorry.

845
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:35,560
Wait, no.

846
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:36,960
I'll stop.

847
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:55,320
Do you like egg yolk?

848
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:59,480
If you don't, pass it to me.

849
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,040
I don't, actually.

850
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,040
Deedee.

851
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:37,880
Excuse me.

852
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:48,040
Are you the new guard
who had a fight with the Rabid Dog?

853
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:49,960
What is it?

854
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:53,440
Do you want revenge?

855
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,200
Kae, are you alright?

856
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:31,520
I'm fine!

857
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:33,080
It's probably the allergy.

858
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:34,520
I'll get better with the medicine.
