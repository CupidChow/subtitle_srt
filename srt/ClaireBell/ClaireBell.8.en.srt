Hey.

8
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,560
You should be happy about this.

9
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,960
It's not that I don't want to be free,

10
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,680
but the thought

11
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,440
of being free without you

12
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,720

what's going to happen

148

Mm...

00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,520
It's like you keep it
in the back of your mind, right?

158
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,840
And just thinking about it...

159
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,440
makes you smile, doesn't it?

160
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,520
Mm.

161
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,120
Something like that.

I'll find you some new comics.

163

Hey.

168
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,520
Have you heard the news

169
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,920
about Mathusorn and Karakade?

170
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,640
Thinking about it
already makes me laugh!

171

Here she comes.

172
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,560
You borrowed the money from me,

173
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,600
and it's time to pay up.

174
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,400
And...

175
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,080
Where did your usual
debt collectors go?

176
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,960
From now on,
I'm collecting the debt myself.

177
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,440
Only you, Kae?

178
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,020
Hmm...

179
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,520
What if I don't pay you back?

180
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,920
You have to pay it back.

181
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,200
Or else the interest will pile up.

182
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,640
Mm...

183
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,480
Hey, Kae.

184
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,680
I'm saying this with good intentions.

185
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,400
Nobody's going to pay you back, girl.

186

you can't do anything to them!

00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,800
As for the debt,

188
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,080
I think you should forget about it.

189
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,640
Carelessly coming to collect the debt

190
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,400
might get you beaten up.

191
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,960
You b*tch!

192
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,920
Give me back my money!

193
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,960
Give it back!

194
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,760
- You think you're tough?
- Huh?

195
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,200
This b*tch!

196
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,280
Aww...

197
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,320
Don't cry.

198
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,120
Next time,

199
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,960
don't come and collect money
from us again.

200
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,400
Are you alright?

201
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,200
Where's my order?

202
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,560
Why do you need your stuff?

203
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,320
I work in the kitchen,

204
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,040
so I need to cook.

205
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,200
What the hell are you thinking?

206
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,360
Kae.

207
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,120
Just do nothing.

208
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,480
It's much safer.

209
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,520
Trust me.

210
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,880
[Teacher Maed]

211
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,700
I've seen everything on this phone.

212
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,680
Who would've thought someone
could do such abhorrent things?

213
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,520
And that person

214
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,400
was my biological brother.

215
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,240
Your sister

216
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,380
loves you so much, you know?

217
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,240
And I hope you'll do the right thing.

218
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,720
I want to reveal the truth.

219
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,640
Natty...

220
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,960
Not here.

221
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,120
I can't take it anymore, Claire.

222
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,920
I know that we've made a promise.

223
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,280
I know that you want to save me.

224
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,320
You want me to keep living my life,

225
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,080
but I can't.

226
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,000
Natty, listen to me.

227
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,360
This will eventually die down.

228
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,040
I can't take it anymore.

229
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,800
I...

230
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,160
Do I have to keep living
and bear the guilt forever?

231
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,800
Natty, listen.

232
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,400
It wasn't your fault at all.

233
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,240
It was my decision.

234
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,480
I'm sorry, sis.

235
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,800
But I can't keep the promise.

236
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,320
Natty...

237
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,760
Please, don't stop me.

238
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,120
The perpetrator stole
the deceased's mobile phone

239
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,160
to conceal the evidence.

240
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,920
However, she has now brought it to us
and handed it over directly.

241
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,390
- Why?
- It's being used to argue a case

242
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,840
of self-defense.

243
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,600
I see.

244
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,320
Based on the footage,

245
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,920
there is some evidence.

246
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,880
What about the girl who got arrested
for this incident years ago?

247
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:32,000
We are currently working to expedite
her release as quickly as possible,

248
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,840
and will also offer
appropriate remedial measures.

249
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,760
This means that
you're about to be free, right?

250
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,720
I don't want my sister to go to jail.

251
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,040
But I just found out

252
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,140
my sister was never happy

253
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,680
with my decision.

254
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,960
I think it's time to

255
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,620
let her make a decision on her own.

256
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,560
Aren't you happy?

257
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,520
We're about to be free together.

258
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,880
I am, of course.

259
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,160
But it feels a bit strange.

260
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,640
I don't know
what's waiting for my sister

261
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,880
from now on.

262
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,680
Everyone has their own path to follow.

263
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,400
You might've set a path for her,

264
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,400
but now it's time for her
to walk it on her own.

265
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,760
No matter what happens,

266
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,120
I believe that you'll stand by her
and fight for her,

267
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,320
like you always do.

268
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,240
Right now,
you're not alone anymore...

269
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,080
because you've got me.

270
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,240
Aren't the wounds
on your face enough?

271
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,360
Do you want more?

272
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,880
I'm just here to congratulate you two.

273
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,640
I heard both of you

274
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,000
are about to be released.

275
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,640
Congratulations to you, too,

276
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,760
for being in a great relationship

277
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,440
with someone you think is great.

278
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,160
I want to give you a little warning.

279
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,640
A rabid dog

280
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,240
is always a rabid dog.

281
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,720
One day, she might come after you,
you know?

282
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,920
Just be careful, alright?

283
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,840
Being a rabid dog

284
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,760
is better than
a dog left to rot like you.

285
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,000
Do you know

286
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,200
what this dog left to rot can do

287
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,880
when its back is against a wall?

288
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,920
As long as I'm around,

289
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,320
you'll never get to touch her.

290
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,960
You can't protect your girl forever.

291
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,360
Just you wait.

292
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,200
Kae, aren't you tired?

293
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,520
Why are you doing this?

294
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,730
What did Claire and I do to you?

295
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,320
You still don't get it?

296
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,280
You betrayed me, Bell.

297
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,840
You betrayed
someone who loved you,

298
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,200
just like everybody did to me.

299
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,240
If you really loved me,

300
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,920
you should be happy that I'm happy.

301
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,940
This isn't love.

302
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,220
It's being selfish.

303
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,480
Inmate Claire declined the visitation.

304
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,110
Is there anything
you'd like us to tell her?

305
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,720
Can I borrow your lighter?

306
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,920
Are you the attorney
who is here for Bell?

307
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,680
Come with me to sign the document.

308
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,840
Where the hell have you been, Kae?

309
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,720
Everyone else has been working
their butts off.

310
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,040
You no longer have the power.

311
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,200
Get to work.

312
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,480
Stop freeloading.

313
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,240
Yeah, I'm so f*cking tired.

314
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,720
[Shrimp-flavored seasoning]

315
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,520
Out of the way, Kae.

316
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,480
I've finished my tray!

317
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,160
- Do you want mine?
- Yeah.

318
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,080
It's so good.

319
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,520
- Oh?
- Here.

320
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,600
Has no one told you

321
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,840
it's rude to stare

322
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,200
at someone eating?

323
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,160
I just want to look at you

324
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,400
before you're released today,

325
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,440
so I have something
to think about.

326
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,760
You teased me?

327
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,480
I'll have it myself, then.

328
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,480
- Is it good?
- Mm!

329
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,600
You're wolfing it down
and choking on it?

330
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:51,450
Bell...

331
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,200
Bell!

332
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,840
Bell! Bell!

333
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,320
You'll be fine, okay?

334
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,200
Bell.

335
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,800
Are you okay?

336
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,320
Guards!

337
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,200
What happened?

338
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,280
She has a shellfish allergy.

339
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,000
Bell...

340
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,200
Bell!

341
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,360
Bell!

342
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,390
Something bad is happening
at the canteen.

343
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:29,360
Right now, sir!

344
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:34,920
Bell!

345
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,480
I'm alright.

346
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,220
Don't do anything crazy, alright?

347
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,640
I'll apologize to her myself.

348
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,720
Kae, what the hell did you do?

349
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,720
You'd better leave.

350
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,920
She's coming.

351
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,000
I told you to f*cking leave!

352
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,800
Get out!

353
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,760
Please help her.
Her allergy has acted up.

354
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,680
We need to send her
to the hospital immediately.

355
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,920
Open the doors.

356
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,240
You did that, you b*tch?!

357
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,760
Yeah!

358
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,800
I f*cking did it.

359
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,760
I knew that she had the allergy,

360
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,160
and I wanted to see how bad it was.

361
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:36,920
You b*tch!

362
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,960
Why did you do it?!

363
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,040
I don't want you two
enjoying life out there!

364
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,610
Please save her.

365
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,800
Go ahead!

366
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,520
Hurt me!

367
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,120
Okay, she's good to go.

368
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,640
If you do, you'll stay here
a bit longer, Claire!

369
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,880
Get a BP on her.

370
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,240
Do it!

371
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,040

No matter how good you are,

379

00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:44,040
You'll never protect your sister!

I'm sorry.

396
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:20,040
What you did was a heinous act

397
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,680
that qualifies as attempted murder.

398
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,440
You will be placed
in solitary confinement,

399
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,480
and your sentence will be extended
by three years.

400

How are you feeling, Bell?

401
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,920
Are you feeling better now?

402
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:26,040
Auay, how did you get here?

403
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:29,400
Mr. Jade asked me to look after you.

You're resigning?

409
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,400
Aren't you happy

410
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:02,920
that you were right?

411
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,120
At the end of the day,
I'm just a failure of a son,

412

413

00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:19,320
What should I be afraid of?

417
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,360
You have an affair with an inmate.

418
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:30,400
You got her pregnant

419
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,960
and even told her
to have an abortion.

420
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,560
How could you do such things?

421

00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,600
Calm down and listen to me.

If I hadn't chosen to work here,

425
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,080
I wouldn't have found out.

426
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,760
I was being impulsive.

427
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,120
I didn't take her seriously at all.

428
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,920

than you do, Warden.

What? Has nobody told you

447
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,920

by three more years?

448

Why did you do that, Claire?

01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:42,040
- This is my house!
- You can't!

559
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:43,070
- What?!
- You can't enter!

560
01:02:43,110 --> 01:02:44,000
Get back to your work.

561
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:46,000
So it's your house, isn't it?

562
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:48,180
Yes.

563
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:58,800
These are yours, correct?

564
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:04,120
Are these yours?

565
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:12,400
I'd like to call my father.

566
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:52,200
Being together for that long...

567
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:54,560
was more than enough, wasn't it?

568
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:23,400
[Petch Pra Uma]

569
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:46,720
[Claire]

570
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:49,760
[Bell]

571
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,600
[Rabid Dog's]

572
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:57,120
[3 years later]

573
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:02,760
Good job today, girls.

574
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:03,800
Yes, Chef!

575
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:12,920
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

576
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,200
Sis, let me hold it for you.

577
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:15,000
No need.

578
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:16,880
I'm a grown-up now.
I can do it myself.

579
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:20,880
Whoa, you've grown!

580
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:23,640
Deedee told us that
she wanted to behave,

581
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:25,120
so she could be released
and see Porches soon!

582
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:26,000
Oh, dear!

583
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:27,240
Stop teasing me!

584
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:28,560
She's grown up now.

585
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:29,040
Whoa!

586
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:30,840
Oh, sh*t!

587
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:38,960
You're not even going to apologize?

588
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:45,140
I guess you don't know who we are.

589
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:54,560
Be more careful next time.

590
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:58,800
I'll be careful next time.

591
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,400
I'm really sorry.

592
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:06,680
Hey, Toothless Dog.

593
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,820
You've been moved here.
Don't cause trouble.

594
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:10,800
Where are my cigarettes?

595
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,040
You're so slow, b*tch.

596
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:13,920
Give me one already.

597
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:21,800
Here, here.

598
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:23,680
Sit down and cut my nails.

599
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:25,760
Sit down!

600
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:27,520
Make sure you don't hurt me.

601
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:29,920
I'll kill you if you do, little b*tch.

602
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:33,360
Just cut them already!

603
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:56,160
You're being released today.

604
01:07:58,080 --> 01:07:59,480
You can stop tending
to the plants now.

605
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:03,920
I can't.

606
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:06,160
It could upset Pa'Porn's soul.

607
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:10,440
It took a lot for them to bloom for her.

608
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:07,120
- My eyes are closed and...
- It's in both my hands!

609
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:09,040
Aww, it's in both of your hands?

610
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:11,800
What about this one?
Can it fly in the air?

611
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:13,120
It looks like this now.

612
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:15,560
Let's fix it.

613
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:16,600
How about this one?

614
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:17,640
I'll make it fly.

615
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:20,200
Go and pick it up!

616
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:21,360
It landed there.

617
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:22,400
It's over there.

618
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:29,840
Can you try it?

619
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:31,800
Can you do it?

620
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:37,420
Is it this way?
Does it spin this way?

621
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:33,480
Good luck.

622
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:12,960
Claire!
