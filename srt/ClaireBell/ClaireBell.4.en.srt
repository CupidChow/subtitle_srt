Bell.

6
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,640
Bell...

7
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,760
Please listen to me, Bell.

8
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,560
You promised
you'd take care of my dad.

9
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,040
His condition got worse really fast...

10
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,000
After a while, he couldn't even talk.

11
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,680
I even tried to have him
moved to a hospital.

12
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,160
That's why I stopped hiring Auay.

13
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,560
But...

14
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,600
we didn't get to do that.

15
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,645
Why didn't you tell me?

16
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,240
I called you so many times,

17
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,920
but you chose
to hide the truth from me.

18
00:01:09,575 --> 00:01:12,320
I was too busy
trying to get you out of here.

19
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,280
I ended up behind bars

20
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,240
because you told me
to get rid of the drugs.

21
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,600
What do you want me to do?

22
00:01:20,753 --> 00:01:23,313
I've tried everything, Bell.

23
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,000
I've done my best.

24
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,100
Bell...

25
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,120
If it bothers you that much,

26
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,840
from now on, stop helping me!

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,480
Do not contact me.

28
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,880
Get out of my life.

29
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,800
- I'm sorry.
- Get out!

30
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,480
Bell?

31
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,560
My dad is dead, Kae.

32
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,760
I didn't even have a chance...

33
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,080
to say my last goodbye to him.

34
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,040
But...

35
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,960
I've seen Wichai

36
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,080
let inmates attend
their parents' funerals.

37
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,160
I'm truly sorry for you.

38
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,120
Nobody wants this to happen.

39
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,320
But...

40
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,080
Leaving the prison abruptly

41
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,960
isn't something you can do.

42
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,560
Is there anything I can do?

43
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,360
It comes with a hefty fee

44
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,240
for arranging a guard for the escort

45
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,320
and other expenses, for instance.

46
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,080
Understood?

47
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,480
I've heard that

48
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,240
you shared a cell with Pa'Porn.

49
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,360
I met her before she passed away.

50
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,640
At least...

51
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,720
I think she looked happy
before she passed.

52
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,840
I'm not sure if this is hers.

53
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Hey, stop!

54
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:43,880
Inmate!

55
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,040
Are you even listening to me?

56
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,960
What are you doing?

57
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,120
Pa'Porn had Alzheimer's.

58
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,640
I reported that to you countless times,

59
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,960
yet why the fuck didn't you take notice?

60
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,480
Answer me, damn it!

61
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,520
Mind your mouth, inmate Claire.

62
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,840
She should've been treated
at a hospital, not here.

63
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,600
The antihypertensive
prescribed to her...

64
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,440
Do you have any idea what happened?

65
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,440
She kept forgetting she'd taken it,

66
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,680
and this is what happened.

67
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,600
You knew that she was sick,
but you chose to ignore it

68
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,400
and didn't do a fucking thing!

69
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,200
I sent the report over and over.

70
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,840
It's you who fucking killed her, Wichai!

71
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,880
Asshole!

72
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,360
Shut the fuck up!

73
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,040
Pa'Porn's death

74
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,560
has nothing to do with me!

75
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,800
Do you fucking understand?!

76
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,200
- Hey! Hey!
- You...

77
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,440
Let go of me!

78
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,200
- Get her!
- Hey!

79
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,160
Let go!

80
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,160
Hands off!

81
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,120
Let me go!

82
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,640
Put her in isolation.

83
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,560
Go!

84
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,760
Bastard!

85
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,280
- It's you who killed her.
- Move!

86
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,080
- Move!
- Wichai, you fucking bastard!

87
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,480
Asshole!

88
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,760
What does she mean by that?

89
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,960
Don't bring this up.

90
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,200
Today, your job is to escort
the inmate leaving the prison.

91
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,600
Come back after the ceremony.

92
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,160
- What about...
- Get out!

93
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,200
[Claire]

94
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,600
Dad...

95
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,560
I don't know

96
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,400
if you can hear me,

97
00:09:56,091 --> 00:09:59,000
but when I'm ready to tell the truth,

98
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,200
it's already too late.

99
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,560
Where were we now?

100
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,440
Bell, can we skip to the final book?

101
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,080
We're only on volume six.

102
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,080
We've got so many volumes
to go through.

103
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,200
I'm worried
I won't be around by then.

104
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,120
I'm sorry that I had to leave you.

105
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,240
I do want to say that

106
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,040
I didn't do anything
to deserve this fate.

107
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,280
I'm going to keep going
to prove myself.

108
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,960
I will not give up.

109
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,360
I will be the daughter you're proud of.

110
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,080
We'll get through this together, Bell.

111
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,840
I love you, Dad.

112
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,800
I love you, too, Bell.

113
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,560
Bell, wait.

114
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,920
These are your dad's
personal belongings.

115
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,400
The authorities gave them to us.

116
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,680
I'm sorry.

117
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,960
Inmate Bell cannot receive items
from outsiders.

118
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,160
Can I at least take this book with me?

119
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,960
So, I can read it when I miss him.

120
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,560
Why are you here?

121
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,880
Don't you get it already?

122
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,800
I'm here to offer my condolences.

123
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,520
I don't need them,

124
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,320
and neither does my dad.

125
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,160
Bell, I'm sorry.

126
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,840
Can you please give me a chance?

127
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,840
Can you bring back my dad?

128
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,240
Can you get rid of the stupid tagging?

129
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,400
If you can't get me out of the prison

130
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,800
or do anything,

131
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,080
then why should I give you a chance?

132
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,600
It's over, Top.

133
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,880
Bell...

134
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,760
[Petch Pra Uma]

135
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,540
The profit doubled from last month.

136
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,920
Dao,

137
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,880
I must admit, you're brilliant.

138
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,720
It's mostly because of Mangpor.

139
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,000
Oh,

140
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,480
and she suddenly got a ton of orders.

141
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,240
This means that I was right

142
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,320
to charge her more.

143
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,160
You're always one step ahead, aren't you?

144
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,400
- Oh...
- Hm?

145
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,120
How's the Pa'Porn situation going?

146
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,720
I called the hospital to state that

147
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,520
she died due to heart failure.

148
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,600
I also paid them off,

149
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,840
so no one would be on our tails.

150
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,480
By the way,

151
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:55,440
where is he off to,

152
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,480
the new, nosy guard?

153
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,720
Oh...

154
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I got him to handle
the inmate leaving the prison.

155
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,160
To be honest,

156
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,600
I don't like him.

157
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,520
He's extremely nosy.

158
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,360
I think he'll cause you trouble
in the future.

159
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,320
You should lay him off.

160
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,680
He hasn't done anything yet.

161
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,040
How can I suddenly get rid of him?

162
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,840
Who is he, and what's his deal?

163
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,240
You...

164
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,560
What's with all the questions?

165
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,440
I feel like this guy's...

166
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,320
kinda something.

167
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,920
Or...

168
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,440
Is he well-connected to the Director?

169
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,880
There's nothing going on.

170
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,640
Just keep doing what you have to do.

171
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,280
If you need anything,

172
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,040
just tell me.

173
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,680
You're worrying too much.

174
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,720
Thank you so much.

175
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,400
I'm sorry for your loss.

176
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,120
Bell.

177
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,560
How are you?

178
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm feeling much better now.

179
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,000
Don't worry, Bell.

180
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,800
From now on,

181
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,000
I'm going to take care of you.

182
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,725
You can stop crying now.

183
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,320
Thank you, Kae.

184
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,600
And thank you for the money

185
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,140
that you lent me to pay the fee.

186
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,680
No worries.

187
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,800
It's nothing.

188
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,160
You still have me, alright?

189
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,080
Uh...

190
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,280
Your stuff is here.

191
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,600
Mm. Thanks.

192
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,200
Oh, how much is the cut?

193
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,320
Uh...

194
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,320
It's 30,000 baht.

195
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,520
30,000 baht?!

196
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,960
This isn't even the peak.

197
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,480
For my next run,
I've got a ton of orders.

198
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,920
I'm sure you'll earn more than this.

199
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,840
Why do you have so many clients?

200
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,720
Is anything up?

201
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,400
Uh...

202
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,440
I might've done the math wrong.

203
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,800
Is it 3,000? Maybe?

204
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,160
Or is it 300?

205
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,520
I think the right amount is 300.

206
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,840
Maybe it's even less than that.

207
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,120
What the hell is up with her?

208
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,800
- Yeah!
- Come on!

209
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,000
- That's what you get.
- Damn you!

210
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,280
- Right here.
- Okay, sis.

211
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,360
Right there.

212
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:33,880
How's that?

213
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,920
Right there.

214
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,880
- Yeah!
- Stomp them!

215
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,000
Stomp them!

216
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,520
Yeah!

217
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,280
Wait, wait...

218
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,920
That's enough. We could kill them.

219
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,840
That's for the unpaid interest.

220
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,160
As for the principal...

221
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,960
I'll come for that later.

222
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,480
Let's go, girls.

223
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,800
- Let's go.
- Time to move.

224
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,760
Kae, come on!

225
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,560
Hurry up.

226
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,200
Hi, Bell!

227
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,440
Have you eaten yet?

228
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,720
I'm hungry.
How about we get some food?

229
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,040
Can we talk about something?

230
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,640
Sure.

231
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,880
What is it?

232
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,640
How'd you make the 3D gang back off?

233
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,360
Why?

234
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,440
I'm just curious.

235
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,320
I've started a business with Deedee.

236
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,560
It's doing really well, you know?

237
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,600
I've got so much money to spend.

238
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,560
Just tell me if you need anything.

239
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,160
I'll treat you.

240
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,320
The business you mean...

241
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,840
loan money?

242
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,120
Uh-huh.

243
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,920
What will happen if the borrower

244
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,520
can't pay you back?

245
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,760
Why are you asking me this?

246
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,720
I think
you should stay away from them.

247
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,520
Or else you'll be in trouble, too.

248
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,000
I can't, Bell.

249
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,600
I've already invested so much.

250
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,760
And they're also done with you,

251
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:33,960
right?

252
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,160
If I quit now,

253
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,280
Deedee might be even madder at us.

254
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,240
At worst,

255
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,080
she might come back and beat us up.

256
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,640
Don't you feel anything

257
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,240
when you see them
beating the borrowers?

258
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,360
But...

259
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,520
I didn't do anything to them.

260
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,760
You just stood there
and let it all happen.

261
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,760
That's just as bad as hurting them.

262
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,400
So, what exactly
do you want from me?

263
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,720
I got them to stop messing with you.

264
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,000
That may be true,

265
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,880
but they're still hurting others.

266
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,640
The worst part is

267
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,240
you hanging out with them,

268
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,240
and that makes you one of them.

269
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,840
You can be mad at me all you want,

270
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,280
but I just want to tell you the truth.

271
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,280
You want the truth that badly?

272
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,760
Fine.

273
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,000
Do you know...

274
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,560
why I'm doing all this?

275
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,360
It's to keep you safe.

276
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,920
I was there for you
when your dad was gone.

277
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,520
I used my own money to bribe Wichai,

278
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,800
so you could go to your dad's funeral.

279
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,040
Think about it, Bell.

280
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,510
Why do you think I did all that?

281
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,320
You know...

282
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,000
Before you came here,

283
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,440
I had nobody.

284
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,960
I was completely alone.

285
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,360
Nobody even asked me...

286
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,840
if I was okay,

287
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,000
hungry,

288
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,440
or feeling lonely.

289
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,340
You're the only person

290
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,480
I can talk to

291
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,400
who makes me feel like

292
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,160
I don't want to be alone anymore.

293
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,360
You want the truth, right?

294
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,680
It's because I like you, Bell.

295
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,000
I have feelings for you
like I've never had before.

296
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,960
Kae...

297
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,800
I don't feel that way,

298
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,200
and I'm sorry if I led you on.

299
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,480
Because I'm not Claire, right?

300
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,320
Kae...

301
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,040
Ever since I got here,

302
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,240
I've never prayed in the Buddha room.

303
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,720
If anyone's got real faith,

304
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,480
it's probably you, Pa'Porn.

305
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,880
Even after all you went through,

306
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,960
you still see the bright side
of everything.

307
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,760
If heaven exists,

308
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,760
I hope you find endless joy.

309
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,480
If there is a next life,

310
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,360
I hope it's an even better one for you.

311
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:47,960
Mm.

312
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,160
I'm done praying.

313
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,720
You are?

314
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,720
Why are you crying?

315
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,160
I'd better charge you rent at this rate.

316
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,720
How could you? This isn't yours.

317
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,360
I'm truly sorry for Pa'Porn.

318
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,720
She's at peace now,

319
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,360
and so is your dad.

320
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,560
They're probably in a better place.

321
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,240
This is the book I always read to him.

322
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,920
I chose this one
because the story is so long,

323
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,880
hoping he'd at least make it

324
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,880
to the final volume.

325
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,180
But in the end, he couldn't make it.

326
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,400
You've already done
a good job, you know?

327
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,240
If I were you...

328
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,520
I wouldn't know

329
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,240
how strong I could stay.

330
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,520
Someone like you

331
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,880
would probably be the strongest here.

332
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,720
You know?

333
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,880
When I first came here,

334
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,680
I always got picked on.

335
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,200
I had nobody on my side,

336
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,400
not even someone to talk to.

337
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,400
I had no one.

338
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,000
At least I had Pa'Porn.

339
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,760
She always cheered me up.

340
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,240
She took care of me
as if we were a family.

341
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,440
I couldn't imagine

342
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,080
what my life would be

343
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,120
without her.

344
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,120
What about your actual family?

345
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,880
It's okay
if you don't want to talk about it.

346
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,520
My parents and I...

347
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,760
We aren't that close.

348
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,800
I wasn't the one they were proud of,

349
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,200
unlike my younger sister.

350
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,760
You have a younger sister, too?

351
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,120
Mm.

352
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,760
Her name was Cream.

353
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,920
She changed it to Natty.

354
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,000
We have nothing in common,

355
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,360
except for how we look.

356
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,020
That probably means she's pretty.

357
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:49,920
If she pays you a visit,

358
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,160
please tell me, okay?

359
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,040
I'd like to have a look at her.

360
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,840
She's not coming.

361
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,080
When I was thrown into prison,

362
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,160
my family suffered a lot.

363
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,960
The teacher who was killed

364
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,480
was loved by many.

365
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,080
So, my sister suffered the most

366
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,040
because her own sister
was the murderer.

367
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,640
You told her not to visit you, right?

368
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,680
I don't want her life to be ruined.

369
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,600
Claire, can I ask you something?

370
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,760
Why did you kill that teacher?

371
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,320
For what he did to my sister,

372
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:20,020
he deserved to die.

373
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,120
You weren't there
to steal a computer, right?

374
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,920
If my sister were thrown in jail,

375
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,880
I'm sure she wouldn't make it.

376
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,980
I wanted to protect her.

377
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,960
Was she the one
who killed the teacher?

378
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,240
I promised her that

379
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,440
this would be our secret,

380
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,500
and it shouldn't be told to anyone.

381
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,240
You also have to promise me, okay?

382
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,520
Why are you telling me this?

383
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,800
Because you're the first

384
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,920
and only one I trust.

385
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,740
This is my first time.

386
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,800
It's okay if you're not ready.

387
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,920
I already told you

388
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,600
that this isn't our home.

389
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,920
You can't just enter the room
whenever you like.

390
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,560
The nurse reported that
Pa'Porn didn't die of heart failure,

391
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,840
but from an overdose.

392
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,600
Listen...

393
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,720
You're not quitting, are you?

394
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,760
At least her relatives

395
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,390
should've been informed
about her actual cause of death.

396
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,640
Do you know that

397
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,240
since Pa'Porn arrived here,

398
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,150
how many of her relatives
have come to see her?

399
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,680
None.

400
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,680
She was just an inmate
with no family who died.

401
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,640
No matter the cause,

402
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:01,140
nobody even cares.

403
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,000
Why are we having the prison

404
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,760
investigated over this?

405
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,640
This is about someone's life, Dad.

406
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,360
Porches! Porches! Porches!

407
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,640
She was already dead.

408
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:17,200
Those of us who are alive
have to keep going.

409
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:19,580
So this is

410
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,760
what you mean by

411
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,900
learning to play the game?

412
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,400
You went to Bell's dad's funeral?

413
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,960
How did you know?

414
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,640
You haven't been
on social media, right?

415
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,520
[He said he broke up with her,
yet they are still seeing each other]

416
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,560
[Maybe not!
I saw them arguing by the crematory]

417
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:09,800
[There goes Top, my idol...
What a failure]

418
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,720
[Bastard]

419
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,001
[Someone like us
wouldn't get out of jail like she did]

420
00:41:12,041 --> 00:41:12,880
[Both father and son are just as bad]

421
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,280
I know you want to help
your girlfriend,

422
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,560
but think it through.

423
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,600
Right now, your life is
pretty much perfect, you know?

424
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,760
You've got good looks

425
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,120
and wealth.

426
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,200
Everybody respects you.

427
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,320
You've got everything, man.

428
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,120
I'm even jealous of you.

429
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,680
But right now...

430
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,960
You're putting everything on the line

431
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,200
just to save her,

432
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,400
who, by the way,
you two have "broken up."

433
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,240
Do you think it's worth it?

434
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,920
I've never taken
a morning shower here.

435
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,840
Seriously?

436
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,520
You're disgusting.

437
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,600
I take a shower before bed

438
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,890
and wake up clean the next day.

439
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,340
How is that disgusting, huh?

440
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,080
Do you even brush your teeth?

441
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,480
I just finished showering.

442
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,800
You're not washing your hair?

443
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,840
I like letting it dry on its own.

444
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,320
It smells nice, you know?

445
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,880
By the way, Bell...

446
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,320
Whatever I did in the past,

447
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,720
let's just move on, okay?

448
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,960
You mean tricking me

449
00:43:08,985 --> 00:43:10,675
into getting beaten up
by the 3D gang?

450
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,840
I've already forgotten about it.

451
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,280
Thanks.

452
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,400
Mangpor...

453
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,320
Have you seen Kae?

454
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,400
I haven't.

455
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,880
So it's just the two of us now, right?

456
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,040
So what?

457
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,720
This means...

458
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,120
we can do anything we want here,
and no one will see it.

459
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,960
No, don't do it!

460
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,920
What are you trying to do?

461
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,160
Let's shower.

462
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,200
I was just teasing you.

463
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,360
Don't be so serious.

464
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,920
I've never taken a shower like this.

465
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,320
Me, too.

466
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,440
I'm here to see a prisoner.

467
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,000
[Ms. Claire]

468
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:57,600
So...

469
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:01,360
Inmate Claire does not wish
to see the visitor.

470
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:03,840
Feel free to leave.

471
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,120
Let's go, Joe.

472
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:19,120
I'm heading home soon.

473
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,720
You can't just leave like this, can you?

474
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:26,760
I'm too exhausted.

475
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:28,730
What?

476
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,000
Huh?

477
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,160
How about doing something
to get refreshed?

478
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,720
No, thanks.

479
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,720
Don't you believe me?
It'll make you feel good.

480
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,480
No, I'm too tired.

481
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,720
I can't do it.

482
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,520
Please, no...

483
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:00,760
- I'm too tired for this.
- Please.

484
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,640
- It won't be long.
- I can't.
