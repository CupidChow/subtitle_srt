Hey, Top!

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,240
What's gotten into you,

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,520
calling me to your place at this hour?

8
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,120
I'm just going to put it here.

9
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,520
It's been a while.

10
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,240
I just want to talk to you.

11
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,160
You're home alone?

12
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,800
Whoa.

13
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,680
My family's overseas.

Whoa!

17
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,000
So, you called me over for a party?

18
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,560
Sure!

19
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,040
Let me get the stuff
from your dad's room.

20
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,400
This will make this night go smoothly.

21
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,440
We can do that later.

22
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,560
Come here.

23
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,720
Let's have a chat.

24
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,360
Are you okay?

25
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,280
Anything wrong?

26
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,320
You look a bit serious.

27
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,280
Beam, how long have we been friends?

28
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,920
Over ten years, I think.

29
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,840
What about it?

30
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,640
16 years.

31
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,320
Yeah, 16 years.

32
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,520
D*mn it.

33
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,520
And do you think

34
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:46,400
there's anything you haven't told me?

35
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,160
What do you mean?

36
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,280
- Sheesh!
- What?

37
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,320
- What's up with you?
- I've got something to show you.

38
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,720
Let me see.

39
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,920
- Sh*t!
- Hey.

40
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,360
Sit tight, okay?

41
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,000
It's about to reach the climax.

42
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,040
Sh*t!

43
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,640
You bribed the bar owner
to delete the footage,

44
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,200
but I f*cking recovered it.

45
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,240
I didn't know it was your girlfriend's.

46
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,600
You knew everything from the start,

47
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,360
but you just kept
your f*cking mouth shut!

48
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,480
At that time, I didn't know what to do.

49
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,640
I didn't think it through.

50
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,040
Of course, you f*cking did!

51
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,400
You wanted to save yourself

52
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,400
and let my girlfriend suffer instead!

53
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,240
How can you do this to me?

54
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,880
How can you do this to Bell?!

55
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,760
How dare you get her thrown in jail?

56
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,920
You're my friend, remember?

57
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,520
F*cking b*stard!

58

Wasn't it you

59
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,920
who gave me the drugs?

60
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,840
Go and confess, d*mn it.

61
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,400
I think everything's gotten

62
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,040
too out of hand already.

63
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,000
What if I refuse?

64
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,240
I'll submit the footage
to the authorities.

65
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,860
So...

66
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,400
I, your dear friend,

67
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,400
have to take the blame, right?

68
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,160
You got Bell arrested.

69
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,960
I'm just doing the right thing

70
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
to save her.

71
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,680
You didn't want to save her, really.

72
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,840
You just want to save yourself.

73
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:27,000
[Roses]

74
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,960
Come on, focus on your work, people.

75
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,200
You're done early,
you'll get to clock out early.

76
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,560
What do you want?

77
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,920
We want to apologize to you.

78
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,040
Now, we've cut ties with Kae.

79
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,760
Didn't she...

80
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,680
kick you out?

81
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,680
She gave our cut
to Mathusorn and Karakade

82
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,720
and

83
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,040
took all of our underlings.

84
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,160
My cut was already small,

85
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,720
and she still gave it to them.

86
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,040
As soon as you hit a wall,

87
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,720
you came crawling back to me,

88
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,160
huh?!

89
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,480
Still, I always give in to you.

90
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,800
Ow!

91
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,680
D*mn you, girls.

92
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,480
Gosh!

93
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,320
Gosh...

94
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,160
You're getting sick because of our hug?

95
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,640
It's indigestion. It'll go away soon.

96
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,160
What are you gonna do about Kae?

97
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,200
You're gonna let her go?

98
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,480
She's messing with 3Ds.

99
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,520
We won't let her go so easily.

100
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,080

101
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,760
Are you even sorry?

102
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,800

103
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,680

104

105

Come and enjoy your meal.

108
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,520
Your mommy's got a ton of debt.

109
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,120
I don't know
if we can afford your next meal.

110
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,360
I'm sorry.

111
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,400
Don't be.

112
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,960
Just having the roses bloom...

113
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,880
is enough to make me happy.

114
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,040
You don't actually have to help me
pay off my debt, you know?

115
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,600
I have to.

116
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,320
We grew the roses together,

117
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,360
so we have to help each other
pay for the fertilizer.

118
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,720
How are we supposed to
get all of the money?

119
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,760
There's only one way.

120
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,320
What is it?

121
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,220
We have to work.

122
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,280
Right?

123
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,680

Work?

127
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,120
Well, others are doing it.

128
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,400
It's nothing weird, right?

129
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,120
Go and grab any available seat, then.

130
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,880
She's been working nonstop.

131
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,120
Her pile of paper is huge!

132
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,640
I've been working for so long,

133
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,510
yet I haven't come even close to her!

134
00:11:28,534 --> 00:11:30,334
How upsetting.

That's enough. We've reached the quota.

There's no overtime pay?

148

Overtime pay?

149
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,000
We don't pay overtime!

150
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,120
The more I work,
the more I'll get paid, no?

151
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,160
You're messing with me?

152
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,880
Just showing up already gets you paid.

153
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,240
It doesn't matter how hard you work.

154
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,520
That sounds so unfair.

155
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,440
The harder we work,
the more we should be paid.

157
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,880
Are you alright?

158
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,280
Good morning.

159
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,520
How are you doing, honey?

160
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,760
Are you exhausted from work?

161
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,680
I'm so worn out.

162
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,680
I was folding the paper all morning.

163
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,520
You can actually work here, you know?

164
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,080
I'm working here by myself.

165
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,320
The job's easy, too.

166
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,700
The wages are a bit low, though.

Double the bet!

- Hey, did you cheat?!
- Hey.

Gosh, I'm so upset.

- What the hell?!

How many times have you won?

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,660
When I was little,
I played Pok Deng with my dad every day.

173
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,920
I was pretty good at it, too.

174

Please, don't.

176
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,080
We should work hard, you know?

177
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,200
It's a shortcut to wealth.

It's not a good one.

179

Do you want me to

180
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,080
quit and work with you?

181
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,840
This way, we'd earn more.

182
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,600
No, it's okay.

183
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,840
You'd be too worn out.

If we don't have enough money,

185
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,400
I'll sell one of my kidneys.

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'll be fine there.

189
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,560
And you won't be lonely.

190
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,880
Hey.

191
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:15,840
Hey!

192
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,840
How long have you been working here?

193
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,320
Why are you so slow?

194
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,760
Look at these two newcomers.

195
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,680
They're outperforming you. Come on.

196
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,560
Don't just stare.

197
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,600
Work harder, d*mn it!

198
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,800
Gosh, one newcomer
is already bad enough.

199
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,600
Now, there are two of them.

200
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,080
They're making it worse for us.

201
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,480
Someone should tell them

202
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,000
that nobody earns more
just by working harder.

203
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,360
She did so much work
on her first day, too.

204
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,840
Quit gossiping.

205
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,080
I told you to work!

206
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,960
We're sorry, Dao.

207
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,160
We're sorry.

208
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,880
We're so sorry, Dao.

209
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,600
[Work hard]

210
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,440
I've gone overboard this time.

211
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,400
Go and sell these.

212
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,640
They'll sure be overjoyed.

213
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,080
Thank you so much, my friend.

214
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,800
Don't forget it, okay?

215
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,520
There are a lot of supplies this time.

216
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,840
Here's a box of art toys.

217
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,080
Give it to your kid.

218
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,280
I've got five kids.

219
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:17,880
There.

220
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,720
Thank you.

221
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:47,960
Where are you going?

222
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,400
I'm asking where you're going.

223
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,520
Your order hasn't arrived, Dao.

224
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,960
You'll get yours on the next delivery.

225
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,480
We knew it

226
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,920
'cause we didn't order anything.

227
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,680
Is there anything you want from me?

228
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,180
Nothing much, really.

229
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,680
I'm not waiting for the next delivery.

230
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,920
I want the ones from today.

231
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,080
But...

232
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,160
These goodies have their owners.

233
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,160
You can't just come and take them.

234
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,720
I want them.

235
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,920
So what?

236
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,960
Deedee...

237
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,280
Talk to your sister.

238
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,920
Kae is gonna be mad if she finds out.

239
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,400
So what?

240
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,100
You're scared of her?

241
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,240
We're going to take all of her goods.

242
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,960
Then, we'll see
what she'll do about it.

243
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,160
We'll beat you up if you do.

244
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,880
These are all valuable goods.

245
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,520
You think I'm dumb enough
to let her carry them alone

246
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:53,310
so you can steal from us?

247
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,360
I've always had my people
watching her.

248
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,520
Hey!

249
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,120
Back off.

250
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,360
Deedee, stop.

251
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,920
Having these girls at my disposal
is so convenient.

252
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,880
I get you now.

253
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,600
I guess...

254
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,760
I'll let you go this time.

255
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,620
Next time, if you dare cross me again,

256
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,960
I won't be so kind.

257
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,320
Dao?

258
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,880
Dao, you're looking a bit sick.

259
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,520
Do you have an allergy?

260
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,080
Do you need my antihistamines?

261
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,320
But it seems like you always
order yours from Mangpor monthly.

262
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,760
Don't you?

263
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,400
Let's go.

264
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,160
We'll deal with you later!

265
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,520
Kae!

266
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,240
What the f*ck have you done?

267
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,200
Well, I've done a lot of things.

268
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,680
Which one are you referring to?

269
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,720
What did you do to my medicine?

270
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,320
Oh...

271
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,000
Your birth control pills?

272
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,760
I swapped it for my antihistamines.

273
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,680
I thought they were the same thing.

274
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,360
Why the f*ck did you do that?!

275
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,400
F*cking why?!

276
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,120
That's a good question, really.

277
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,480
Why did I do it?

278
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,560
When you were in power,

279
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,160
you treated us like sh*t.

280
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,200
You abused Wichai's power

281
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,640
to control all of us

282
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,580
so that we had to do your bidding.

283
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,040
Do you know

284
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,040
how resentful I've become?

285
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,360
But I couldn't do
a f*cking thing about it.

286
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,840
I have to thank your sister, Deedee,

287
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,200
for letting me grow
somewhat in power.

288
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,040
And I've actually done it.

289
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,640
The problem is,

290
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,080
as long as you and Wichai
are still around,

291
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,360
I can't be in full control.

292
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,920
Is there a way

293
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:18,120
I can get rid of both of you
at the same time?

294
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,080
Then I got an idea.

295
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,800
If the head female inmate

296
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,330
got pregnant by the warden,

297
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,760
you two would definitely
be in deep sh*t.

298
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,360
You b*tch. I'll f*cking kill you!

299
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,400
I'll kill you!

300
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,400
I'll destroy you!

301
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,440
Dao.

302
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,780
Calm down.

303
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,560
You're pregnant, aren't you?

304
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,480
I think from this point on,

305
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,840
you'd better think about
what you're gonna do next.

306
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,120
You only have about
7-8 months left don't you?

307
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,680
Let me go!

308
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,640
Hands off!

309
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,080
- Dao...
- F*ck off!

310
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,240
How much have we made?

311
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,280
Um...

312
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,160
I think
we've already made over half.

313
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,240
Why did you ask me that?

314
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,880
All we've done is work.

315
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,760
We haven't had time
for sweet moments.

316
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,760
But we share
the same cell, don't we?

317
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,680
It's not like that!

318
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,280
I mean...

319
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,960
Having a chat
or doing things together.

320
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,720
Mm.

321
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,340
Well...

322
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,080
Once we've got enough money,

323
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,560
should we quit the job?

324
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,360
Do we have to inform anybody first?

325
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,800
I think it's Dao.

326
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,880
Where has she gone, though?

327
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,080
We haven't seen her in days.

328
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,000
I don't know either.

329
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,520
I'll deal with Kae.

330
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,600
What's the plan?

331
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,520
I'm up for this.

332
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,120
Dao.

333
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,240
Are you good?

334
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,200
You've been sick
for a few days now.

335
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,800
I'm fine.

336
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,900
You're not pregnant, are you?

337
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,680
Maybe you just ate too much.

338
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,240
Go and tell Kae

339
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,440
that I've agreed with Wichai

340
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,960
to let her be in charge of everything
instead of us,

341
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,200
in exchange for us
being her business partners.

342
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,720
Tell her to talk to Wichai
in the office.

343
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,600
What?

344
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,000
Why are you giving up so easily?

345
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,160
I'm not.

346
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,560
I'm going to trick her.

347
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,560
I want you to lure her out

348
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,800
to where Duen and I will ambush her.

349
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,280
Hold up...

350
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,200
What if she brings
her underlings with her?

351
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,440
Right.

352
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,080
If you told her
to talk to Wichai in person,

353
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,400
she wouldn't dare bring them.

354
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,720
She's scared of him.

355
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,600
This time...

356
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,840
We'll deal with her once and for all.

357
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,280
We'll make her know
that we're serious.

358
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,280
That way,
she won't be in our hair later.

359
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,840
I can't believe

360
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,060
you've changed this much.

361
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,000
When one has the money and power,

362
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,080
life does get better.

363
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,640
I mean,

364
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,960
you've turned into
a sc*mmier person.

365
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,120
What do you f*cking want?

366
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,280
I'm here to tell you that

367
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,040
we've paid off the debt.

368
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,720
Go and check it yourself.

369
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,920
I said I want the full amount.

370
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,160
We've paid off both
the principal and interest.

371
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,840
We even gave you 200 baht extra.

372
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,840
Sis, let me go and check it.

373
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:19,960
No need.

374
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,720
They're honest.

375
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,280
Don't you want to talk to me?

376
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,400
I'm your old friend after all.

377
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,900
I've got nothing to talk to.

378
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,320
Let's go.

379
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,640
So, we've both got nothing now,

380
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,400
huh?

381
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,680
Having you by my side

382
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,640
just feels like
I've got everything I need.

383
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,880
Aw.

384
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,320
You're better at sweet talk now.

385
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,920
Should we ask them
for a single bed?

386
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,720
We never sleep on the upper bed.

387
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,480
Come on, Dao...

388
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,120
How am I going to
brush my teeth now?

389
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,840
Do we also have to do it here?

390
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:38,760
Gosh.

391
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,520
This feels so sinful.

392
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:45,080
There aren't any cameras here.

393
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,080
This is the perfect spot.

394
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,680
Here.

395
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,280
Do I have to do it, too, Dao?

396
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,040
What?

397
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,440
Just in case she knows.

398
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,720
Use it for self-defense.

399
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,160
Are we really doing this?

400
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,480
It's either them or us.

401
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,120
Hey!

402
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,320
Please let me have this!

403
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,600
You can do better!

404
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,520
I want to talk business with you.

405
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,760
Do you think we've got anything left
to talk about?

406
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,680
Fine. What is it?

407
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,800
Let's hear it.

408
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,320
Dao tells me to...

409
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,480
Speak loudly!

410
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,080
I can't f*cking hear you.

411
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,840
Dao wants you to take control
of the entire business

412
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,200
that Wichai provided her with,

413
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,800
but you'd need to make us
your business partners.

414
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,280
Um...

415
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,240
Would she

416
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,040
really sacrifice all her connections
in the prison

417
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,040
just to be my business partner?

418
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,720
Well, the earnings we've made here

419
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,360
aren't doing as well as
your loan business.

420
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,760
That's why she wants to negotiate.

421
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,560
I guess she hasn't wanted
to do hard work lately.

422
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,680
I can see that.

423
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,000
She's pregnant after all.

424
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,560
What did you just say?

425
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,120
Pregnant?

426
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,000
I'll talk.

427
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,520
Let's go, girls.

428
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,680
You're all going?

429
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,440
What's the problem with that, huh?

430
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:53,820
I...

431
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,320
I'm worried this might upset Wichai.

432
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,760
If I go alone

433
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
and it's an ambush,

434
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,880
what am I supposed to do?

435
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,090
Come here.

436
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,480
Not yet.

437
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,880
It's best we wait here.

438
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,360
Where's yours?

439
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,760
Deedee.

440
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,640
What's wrong with you?

441
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,880
Why are you walking like that?

442
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,440
I'm on my period.

443
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,760
Let me do a quick check.

444
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,200
Fine.

445
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,760
Go and get it done.

446
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,400
We can't have a negotiation

447
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,360
if your pants are all messy.

448
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,880
It'd be too disgusting.

449
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,840
We'll wait here.

450
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,720
Go on without me.

451
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,880
I'll join you later.

452
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:21,720
Okay.

453
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,640
Yes, sis.

454
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,280
Don't keep me waiting.

455
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,520
Sis, we're screwed!

456
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,760
They're all here!

457
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,800
What do we do?

458
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,800
At this rate,
there's no turning back.

459
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:34,300
Be ready.

460
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,400
Inmate Deedee.

461
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:55,760
Please come with me.

462
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,000
As for the rest...

463
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,360
Please leave this area.

464
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,680
I command you to leave.

465
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,680
I guess we'll have a talk later.

466
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,720
Let's go.

467
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,760
Move it, girls.

468
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,600
- Let me go.
- Please come with me.

469
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,680
Where are you taking me to?

470
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,720
Let me go.

471
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,880
What the hell are you doing?

472
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,640
Put it away.

473
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,960
Let me go!

474
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:45,960
Put me down!

475
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,080
I told you to put me down!

476
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,120
Let me go!

477
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,520
Put me down, d*mn it!

478
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,720
Put me down!

479
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,680
Be quiet!

480
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,840
Don't cause any trouble.

481
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,000
You can't just keep me here!

482
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,040
Let me out!

483
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,280
Let me out!

484
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,240
Let me go...

485
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,400
I'm scared of the dark!

486
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,680
I don't wanna be here!

487
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,920
Hey.

488
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,520
The new guard
put Deedee in confinement.

489
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,800
What do you want me to do?

490
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,400
Can you tell him to free her?

491
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,240
I'm afraid I can't do that.

492
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,640
Why not?

493
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,920
You're the warden.

494
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,360
Porches spoke
to the director himself.

495
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,800
He also gave him the green light.

496
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,560
What's that son of a b*tch good for?

497
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,400
Why are you always protecting him?

498
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,600
You let him mess around,

499
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,360
and now almost everything
is going to sh*t.

500
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,680
What kind of warden

501
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,160
can't control his guards?

502
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,120
He's my son!

503
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,960
He is my son!

504
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,200
Do you get it now, Dao?!

505
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,480
And you let him work here

506
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:24,360
in a room where we f*ck?!

507
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,480
Are you f*cking nuts?

508
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,080
Your wife asked for this, huh?

509
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,720
So you just had to do it, right?

510
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,060
You said you broke up with her...

511
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,040
Was that a lie?

512
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,240
What did you expect?

513
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,360
You expected us
to live happily together?

514
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,280
You're an inmate.

515
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,160
I'm the warden.

516
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,760
It's already wrong
right from the start.

517
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,400
Then why did you
start the relationship with me?

518
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,160
Why the f*ck did you give me hope?!

519
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,160
When the f*ck did I do that?!

520
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,440
We had a great time together,
didn't we?

521
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,640
I've treated you well,

522
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,440
but if you ask more than this,

523
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,080
I can't give it to you.

524
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,680
Get it, Dao?

525
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,800
This place

526
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,760
isn't the real world.

527
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,440
My real world is f*cking out there!

528
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,760
You got me pregnant.

529
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,640
Is reality hitting you now?

530
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,160
Why did you let it happen,

531
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,160
huh?!

532
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,240
Why didn't you use contraception?!

533
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,520
You also had sex with me.

534
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,320
So why didn't you use protection?

535
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,760
You...

536
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,800
Go and get an abortion.

537
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,880
Get rid of the newborn.

538
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,080
I refuse!

539
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,320
I've already left my son out there.

540
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,920
I'm not letting this one slip away.

541
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,040
You refuse?

542
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,600
I will not let you

543
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,440
ruin my life.

544
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,400
Get an abortion right now.

545
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,440
Get an abortion immediately.

546
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,400
I...

547
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,160
I'm sorry.

548
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,440
I didn't mean it.

549
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,800
Dao!

550
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,320
Can I ask you a question?

551
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:34,320
Why did you settle on growing the roses?

552
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,120
When I first ended up here,

553
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,240
I was out of my mind.

554
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,800
Pa'Porn suggested
I do some gardening,

555
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,440
so I'd have something to do

556
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,400
and could pull myself together.

557
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,640
Then I asked her

558
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,680
which plant was the hardest to grow.

559
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:56,640
She said she didn't know,

560
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,880
but her favorite plant was

561
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,600
roses.

562
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,120
Since then,

563
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,320
I've been trying my best
to make them bloom...

564
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,320
for her to see.

565
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,240
But it was too late.

566
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,280
I'm sure she can see them
from up there.

567
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,920
Inmate Bell.

568
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,160
A visitor would like to see you.

569
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,800
Hurry. Get up.

570
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,720
What are you doing here, Beam?

571
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:25,800
How are you doing, Bell?

572
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,840
On that day, I did it because...

573
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,400
I didn't think it through.

574
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,920
I'm really sorry.

575
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,280
What did you do?

576
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,040
The drugs at the bar...

577
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,800
They were Top's.

578
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,040
Yes, they were his.

579
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:35,220
[Roses]

580
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,280
What's wrong?

581
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,880
Earlier...

582
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,240
The person who put the drugs
in my handbag

583
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,180
visited me and told me

584
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:48,720
he was going to turn himself in.

585
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,520
I'm about to be free now.

586
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,200
I'm so happy for you.

587
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,840
[Claire & Bell]

588
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,440
Screaming this much...

589
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,960
You're gonna
have no voice tomorrow.

590
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,360
Could you let me out

591
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,760
at least for a little while?

592
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:00,960
How about

593
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,320
I'll talk to you for a while,

594
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,640
so you won't be scared.

595
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:05,800
Agreed?

596
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:07,720
Sure.

597
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,960
Don't go anywhere, okay?

598
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,440
Hey! Why did you close the panel?!

599
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,280
You said you'd stay!

600
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,400
I don't wanna be alone.

601
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,200
I'm scared.

602
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,200
I'm still here.

603
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,720
Since you're going to be free,

604
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,360
should we go out
and do something fun?

605
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,680
Mm. Sure.

606
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:03,720
Give it a try, okay?

607
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:05,620
Are you sure?

608
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:06,760
Mm.

609
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:29,240
Hey!

610
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,320
What happened?

611
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:33,640
What the hell happened?

612
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,680
Are you there?

613
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:43,600
The power went out.

614
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:44,640
I'll go investigate.

615
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:45,900
No!

616
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,400
I don't wanna be alone.

617
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,440
I'm scared.

618
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,520
No need to investigate.

619
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:56,800
Power outages are common here.

620
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:58,320
The power should be back soon.

621
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,160
Okay.

622
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:10,680
Are you still there?

623
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,840
Mm. I'm still here.

624
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,080
The power's back.

625
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:59,000
Should we leave?

626
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:00,560
It's fine.

627
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,550
The computer
that monitors the cameras is old.

628
00:49:02,590 --> 00:49:04,040
It'd take hours to reboot.

629
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:04,800
Come on!

630
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,560
What flavor do you want?

631
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,280
No, I'll pick it for you.

632
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:13,000
Okay.

633
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,920
You're not sassy.

634
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,720
Yet, you're also not that prim.

635
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:23,280
Sometimes,
you show your fiery side.

636
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:25,800
And you like to share, too.

637
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,240
Alright, I'll go with this one.

638
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:30,640
Here.

639
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,360
What does this
have to do with sharing?

640
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:35,680
You have to share it with me.

641
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:36,920
Gosh!

642
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:17,520
There are so many jobs out there,

643
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,560
but why a guard?

644
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:23,680
Isn't it worse

645
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,200
being an inmate?

646
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,560
Yeah, you have a point.

647
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,200
I can't get along with others that well.

648
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,560
They say that I'm too blunt.

649
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,480
You're not blunt.

650
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,520
You're just clueless.

651
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,640
Are you taking a jab at me?

652
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,880
I'm not.

653
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,520
Isn't 'clueless' an insult?

654
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,280
Like...

655
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,160
Gosh. How do I explain this?

656
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,160
You're like a clueless person.

657
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,480
You're lost and confused,

658
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:10,140
doing things you think are good

659
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,480
without considering
how others might feel.

660
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:15,480
Get it?

661
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,880
You've never been in a relationship?

662
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,040
I haven't.

663
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,120
I knew it.

664
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:30,000
If my predictions are this good,
I could win the lottery.

665
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,680
You seem like

666
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,920
you've dated a lot.

667
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:40,800
When it comes to men,

668
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:43,320
I've dated a couple.

669
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:45,000
For girls...

670
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:46,880
I've also dated a couple of them.

671
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,240
But as for dating a guard...

672
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,480
I've never dated one.

673
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,000
It's impossible, I'm afraid.

674
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:01,800
It's against the rules.

675
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,080
See?

676
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,520
You really are clueless.

677
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,400
What exactly does 'clueless'
mean to you?

678
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,320
Here's an example.

679
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,760
When a girl watches a horror movie
with her partner

680
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:20,960
and says,

681
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,000
"It's so scary."

682
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:25,960
It doesn't mean that she's scared.

683
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:27,920
She just wants a hug.

684
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:31,160
But her partner can't read the room,

685
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,520
so they take her out of the theater.

686
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,640
It's something like that.
You feel me?

687
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,440
Uh...

688
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,720
You said you're scared of the dark...

689
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:48,340
Are you actually scared of it

690
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,520
or just want me to stay with you?

691
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:59,320
I'm actually scared, okay?

692
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:08,440
But...

693
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,840
I also want you to stay close to me.

694
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,480
See? You like sharing.

695
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,240
So good.

696
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,160
I'd actually like to have it,

697
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,160
but I have a shellfish allergy.

698
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:55,400
Aww...

699
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,040
You're missing out, you know?

700
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:16,680
I'm stuffed!

701
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:19,560
Whoa...

702
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,280
You stole my cup, too!

703
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,640
It's been a long time
since I got to stargaze like this.

704
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:36,960
Me too.

705
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,440
Staying here...

706
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:41,080
If I didn't break out
of the cell at night,

707
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,640
I wouldn't get to
see anything like this.

708
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:49,440
I've never stargazed
when I was out there.

709
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
It feels like...

710
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,640
When I could see the stars
every night,

711
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:57,320
I started taking them for granted

712
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,360
and stopped appreciating them.

713
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:05,960
Soon...

714
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:09,080
You'll get to see the stars
in the world out there.

715
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,240
It's different from here, though.

716
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,240
They look the same
under any night sky.

717
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:36,640
The stars are the same,

718
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:40,920
but the experience is different.

719
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,400
You know...

720
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:06,640
I've heard that

721
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,240
the stars that we're seeing...

722
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:13,400
Before the light reaches our planet,

723
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,360
it takes millions of years.

724
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:20,760
Sometimes,

725
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,360
the stars we're seeing...

726
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,560
They might not exist anymore.

727
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,080
This means that...

728
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:38,480
If aliens are looking
at Earth right now,

729
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:41,440
by the time
they could see us lying here,

730
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:42,980
it'd take millions of years for them?

731
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,560
Let's make cute poses

732
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,280
for the aliens millions
of light-years away,

733
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:51,680
okay?

734
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:54,560
Yay!

735
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,280
Let's do a heart pose.

736
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,080
This one.

737
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:21,160
Should we head back?

738
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,320
No, I'm not leaving.

739
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:24,480
Come on.

740
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:26,960
- We'll get soaked.
- I'm staying here.

741
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,240
This is the last night.

742
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:31,840
Let's get soaked.

743
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,160
Natty.

744
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:42,480
We're here.

745
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,040
We've arrived.

746
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,400
No one should be here.

747
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:12,960
Thanks.

748
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,320
Are you sure you're okay?

749
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:18,080
Mm.

750
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:51,760
Natty!

751
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:52,440
Sh*t!

752
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:56,800
Are you really sure you're fine?

753
00:59:58,760 --> 00:59:59,560
Mm.

754
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:49,560
I've learned all of the truth.

755
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:53,920
The news reporters came here...

756
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:57,080
Was it because of the incident?

757
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:18,780
Please help me unlock my phone.

758
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,380
I forgot the password.

759
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:22,160
A phone this old...

760
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:23,580
I can tell this is not yours.

761
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:24,840
Whose is this?

762
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:27,760
It's fine
if you don't want to tell me.

763
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:30,000
I'm not doing
something illegal, right?

764
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:31,600
You're not.

765
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:34,200
It was my brother's.

766
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:37,160
It's a bit upsetting, really.

767
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,640
But it's okay.

768
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,600
When I first ended up here,

769
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,040
I wasn't really myself.

770
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:45,080
Over time,

771
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:48,160
I realized that I could order things

772
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:49,920
and do my hair.

773
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:51,760
That's when I started
feeling more confident.

774
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:55,840
♫Please don't leave me alone♫

775
01:01:56,640 --> 01:02:00,240
♫Please don't lock me up by myself♫

776
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:08,680
♫Please don't let me suffer
and drown in my thoughts♫

777
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:12,960
♫I, too, can shed a tear♫

778
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:17,360
♫I'm as frail as others can be♫

779
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:25,960
♫Despite that, all I can do
is keep everything in my mind♫

780
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:32,720
It's done.

781
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:42,320
♫Everything has remained
as beautiful as we've dreamed♫

782
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,280
Tell me the truth, dear.

783
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:50,680
Regardless...

784
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:54,080
You and Claire

785
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:57,960
are both my daughters.

786
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:06,880
♫I'd like to ask you something
if you really have to leave♫

787
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:09,000
I was the one who did it.

788
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:13,360
I killed that teacher.

789
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:34,480
When I was little,

790
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:37,840
Dao told me that
I had to take care of myself.

791
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:39,880
At the end of the day,
Duen had to take care of me.

792
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:42,680
Are you still there?

793
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:44,320
Have you been listening?

794
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:58,760
Come here!

795
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:00,920
No! No!

796
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:11,240
♫If, from now on, it's simply a dream,♫

797
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:20,120
♫I hope there's a day
that our paths will cross♫

798
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:26,200
♫So please do not forget about me♫
