This time,

00:00:48,713 --> 00:00:51,353
you've got nowhere to hide.

7
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,160
Stay here, Pa.

8
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,720
Or you'll get caught in the crossfire.

00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,320
I'm gonna straighten you out.

10
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,040
So?

11
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,960
Not so tough anymore, are you?

12
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,480
Run on the count of three.

13
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,240
In the blink of an eye,

14
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,880
the tables have turned.

15
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,400
What are you doing?

16
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,140
Don't do anything crazy.
I'm a guard here.

17
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,480
That's why they call me the Rabid Dog.

18
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,360
I always do real crazy stuff.

19
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,400
Don't you fucking know?

20
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,960
One...

21
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,200
Two...

22
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:47,800
Three!

23
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,160
- Hey! After her!
- Stop!

24
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:49,840
- Duen!
- Go!

25
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,720
Guards!

26
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,480
- Guards!
- Stop!

27
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,400
Let go of me! What the hell?!

28
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,600
Be quiet!

29
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,000
- Let go!
- Stay still.

30
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,320
You're full of tricks, aren't you?

31
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,040
Let go!

32
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,920
- Your shoe!
- Oh!

33
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,720
- Let me go!
- Stay still!

34
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,240
Let go...

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:13,880
Oh...

36
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,440
I've made up my mind.

37
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,560
Call the other guards.

38
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,240
Drag her to our cell.

39
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,440
Don't do it here.

40
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,360
Come on!

41
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,880
- Quit being pretentious!
- Come here!

42
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,520
I told you to call the guards!

43
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,720
Code 17, situation 200!

44
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,440
What?!

45
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,360
What do we do, sis?

46
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,200
Bell!

47
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,240
What should we do?

48
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,040
What do we do?!

49
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,640
- What happened?!
- Stop!

50
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,080
Hold it!

51
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,440
Stop them!

52
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,760
- Stop!
- Hands over your head!

53
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,680
What's going on?

54
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,360
How did the inmates get out?

55
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,680
Kneel.

56
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,880
- Kneel!
- Get on the ground!

57
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,520
She forgot something.

58
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,160
Stop!

59
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,600
On the ground!

60
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,040
Get down!

61
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,280
On the ground!

62
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,540
Get on the ground!

63
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,440
Now!

64
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,880
All of you!

65
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,760
On the ground!

66
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,200
Get on the ground!

67
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,440
Hands behind your back!

68
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,240
You enjoy causing trouble, don't you?

69
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,720
[Visiting Day]

70
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,760
So what on earth happened?

71
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,640
Didn't you hear the question?

72
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,000
What happened?!

73
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,600
These inmates had a fight
in front of the cells last night.

74
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,440
So how did they manage
to get out of their cells?

75
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,680
You just got out of solitary

76
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,640
and already caused trouble?

77
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,480
What happened to your head?

78
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,720
Popped a pimple.

79
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,880
You find it funny, do  n't you?

80
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,920
Very well.

81
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,480
Stand here until someone reveals the truth.

82
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,880
You, come and see me at my office.

83
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
Get inmate Dao too.

84
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,840
I assigned you to take care of the inmates,

85
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,400
but your sisters got into a fight.

86
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,800
Inmates settling a problem
with one another is nothing new.

87
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,280
It's the incompetent guard

88
00:06:09,313 --> 00:06:11,033
- who has to take responsibility.
- I said when I got there,

89
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,560
they were already fighting!

90
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,360
So how did your baton end up inside a cell?

91
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,000
Oh...

92
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,640
You're the one who nearly got
strangled to death by the Rabid Dog, right?

93
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,680
You must've held a real deep grudge, right?

94
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,960
Perhaps the reason you radioed for backup

95
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,960
was because you couldn't handle Claire.

96
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,160
What nonsense did you just say?

97
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,080
How would I do that?

98
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,920
Cell doors don't open by themselves.

99
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,000
Only the guards can unlock them!

100
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,520
Who the hell do you think you are, inmate?

101
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,560
I'm a guard, remember?

102
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,600
If you're just an incompetent guard,

103
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,000
you're just as shitty as a prisoner like me.

104
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,880
Sir, are you going to
allow her to say such things?

105
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,800
Your mouth deserves a taste of my baton!

106
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,720
Stop!

107
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,040
Shut it, both of you.

108
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,720
I'm giving you a chance to say the truth

109
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,040
before checking the CCTV footage myself.

110
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,720
The Rabid Dog...

111
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,440
She has violent tendencies.

112
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,000
I simply wanted to teach her a lesson.

113
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,560
But Deedee and the new inmate
were already having a fight.

114
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,600
That has nothing to do with me.

115
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,120
I propose transferring
the problematic inmates elsewhere

116
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,880
so they won't cause
any more problems here.

117
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,000
I agree with your proposal,

118
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,000
but the one being transferred is you.

119
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,040
Pack up all of your stuff.

120
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,560
Sir...

121
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,120
- But these bastards...
- Quiet!

122
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,080
The only person here causing me problems

123
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,120
is no one else but you!

124
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,160
Are you going to resign

125
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,400
or make me fire you?

126
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,120
I just submitted a request
to reduce your sentence.

127
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,480
You know?

128
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,080
If the director catches wind of this,

129
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,040
do you know what will happen to me?

130
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,000
Dao...

131
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,240
You've truly disappointed me.

132
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,080
If something like this happens again,

133
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,200
you and your sisters'
family visit quota this year

134
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,760
will be the last you'll ever get.

135
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,700
Get it?

136
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,960
Bell?

137
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,760
Are you alright?

138
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,240
Bell.

139
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,180
Bell!

140
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,320
Weak.

141
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,440
You saw it, right?

142
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,880
Claire caught Bell when she fell.

143
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,560
My eyes weren't playing tricks on me, right?

144
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,760
Yes, I saw it, too.

145
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,040
It's so weird.

146
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,720
She usually doesn't interact with anyone
except Pa'Porn.

147
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,080
Maybe she accidentally fell into her.

148
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,560
Claire could've just stepped aside, no?

149
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,960
If I were her,
I would've beaten the newbie up on the spot.

150
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,920
So ruthless.

151
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,120
- All of you, get the fuck out!
- Oh, God!

152
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,680
Yes, sis!

153
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,920
Except you two.

154
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,800
Dao...

155
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,760
The new inmate started it.

156
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,800
- We just...
- She did?

157
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,040
She did, huh?!

158
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,480
Are you okay? Did that hit you?

159
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,800
Quit worrying about her!

160
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,840
Sit!

161
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,840
Okay.

162
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,840
What did I tell you?

163
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,800
You can cause trouble

164
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,560
but keep the matter away from me!

165
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,760
You told a guard to
unlock the cells at night just to fight?

166
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,920
Do you think no one saw that?!

167
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,560
There are cameras!

168
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,520
Wichai told me...

169
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,720
Should you cause any more trouble,

170
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,360
our annual family visit quota will be revoked.

171
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,520
How dare...

172
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,440
Right?!

173
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,920
How dare you?!

174
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,040
Mom could only visit us once a year.

175
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,920
What would you do if that gets revoked?

176
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,200
Do you still remember

177
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,440
what I told you after I got arrested?

178
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,480
"Take care of Mom

179
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,360
and my kid!"

180
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,080
Yet, both of you somehow ended up here!

181
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,560
I've tried requesting

182
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,960
to reduce your time here.

183
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,640
Don't disappoint me.

184
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,360
It's all because of Bell.

185
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,880
Feeling better?

186
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,120
How are you now?

187
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,800
Let me sprinkle some holy water on you.

188
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,120
May it cleanse all evil from you.

189
00:12:10,433 --> 00:12:11,793
Oh, Pa'Porn...

190
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,640
I just put the ointment on her.

191
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,320
You washed it off with that holy water.

192
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,440
I'm sorry, love.

193
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,920
That's okay.

194
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,280
It's okay, Pa.

195
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,280
Perhaps that will help things get better.

196
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:23,960
Kae?

197
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,600
I need to talk to you.

198
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,520
Come here.

199
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,720
I'll be right back.

200
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,040
What is it?

201
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,440
Is the stuff I ordered out of stock?

202
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,680
Or do you want me to recheck the order?

203
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,400
Be honest.

204
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,040
You've got a crush on the new inmate,

205
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,880
haven't you?

206
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,880
No!

207
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,240
N-no, not at all!

208
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,680
I don't have a crush on her!

209
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,560
What kind of question was that?

210
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,400
Whatever, that's up to you.

211
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,120
However...

212
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,720
I think you should keep a distance from her.

213
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,320
Deedee now wants her head.

214
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,960
After the annual family visit,

215
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,040
if you still keep going,

216
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,840
you'll get caught up in the trouble as well!

217
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,560
At that rate,

218
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,520
I won't be able to help you.

219
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,600
That's my son.

220
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,120
He's going to come visit in a few days.

221
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,040
He didn't come last year.

222
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,080
This year, he's definitely coming!

223
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,040
Alright. Let's pray.

224
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,880
Could you pass me the prayer book, love?

225
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,840
It's in the drawer.

226
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,480
Huh?

227
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,040
How did this end up here?

228
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,640
How?

229
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,640
Oh, I forgot.

230
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:59,000
Claire asked me to return it to the library,

231
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,360
but I forgot.

232
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,360
Are you close to Claire?

233
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,360
We share a cell, love.

234
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,720
Of course we're close.

235
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,560
Huh?

236
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,160
You're her cellmate?

237
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,000
Yes.

238
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,480
And...

239
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,080
You're not afraid she'd hurt you?

240
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,040
Why would I?

241
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,640
She's different from what everybody says.

242
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,320
When you were being jumped,

243
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,960
it was Claire

244
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
who told the new guard to radio for help.

245
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,000
Come on. Let's pray.

246
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,200
[Praying]

247
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,800
No, move it to another row.

248
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,560
There, like that.

249
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,360
Tie that securely.

250
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,640
[Family Visit Day]

251
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,040
They're this serious about the day, huh?

252
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,760
It's like a New Year celebration.

253
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,600
Mm.

254
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,360
You know, inmates are willing to stay

255
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,840
just to wait for the annual family visit.

256
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,400
♫No, no, no, I don't get
what you're trying to say♫

257
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,600
What's Ice Paris doing here?

258
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,360
He visits the prison every year.

259
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,960
So handsome!

260
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,360
His sister is serving her sentence here.

261
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,560
It's her.

262
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,240
What was her charge?

263
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,480
Uh...

264
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,680
She shot her husband dead in a pub.

265
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,160
She always looks pissed.

266
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,480
Let's go.

267
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,480
You're missing your family?

268
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,760
Since I was thrown into prison,

269
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,240
I haven't told my dad about all this.

270
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,080
He's suffering from cancer,

271
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,520
and I'm worried he'd get worse if I say it.

272
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,540
I wonder how he's doing.

273
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,600
Someone might visit you, you know?

274
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,680
Right?

275
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,880
Who's coming to see you?

276
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,920
My boyfriend.

277
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,680
Oh...

278
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,640
You're already in a relationship?

279
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,260
That's news to me.

280
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,320
He's helping me with my case.

281
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,280
That's good.

282
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,800
I hope he comes here with good news.

283
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,800
Thank you.

284
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,640
What? That's all I get?

285
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,680
A special treatment from Deedee.

286
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,880
Oh, my!

287
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,240
- Can I have some as well?
- Absolutely.

288
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,480
Thank you very much!

289
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,400
I'm so tired from dancing.
I could eat a horse right now!

290
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,240
Yeah, give me a ton of that.

291
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,600
That's the stuff.

292
00:16:41,646 --> 00:16:42,926
Can I have that, too?

293
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,480
- Oh, thank you.
- Danced a bit too much?

294
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,260
Yeah, I let myself go a bit too much.

295
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,160
Oh, it's dripping.

296
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,320
That's enough. Thank you!

297
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,160
- Spoons are right there.
- Thank you.

298
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,800
Good luck.

299
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,640
Hello! Hello!

300
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,880
She's annoying me, Dao.

301
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,400
She's looking so nonchalant.

302
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,320
Deedee.

303
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:14,280
If you cause trouble
and my visit gets revoked,

304
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,160
I'll put your face on the ground.

305
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,280
Come on. I'm not going to do anything.

306
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,760
I'm also waiting for
my boyfriend to come and see me.

307
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,880
Lately, he hasn't come here at all.

308
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,600
You got arrested for prostitution.

309
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,200
You're so lucky that he's still with you.

310
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,600
I got arrested for extortion.

311
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,080
Not prostitution, alright?

312
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,880
I never sleep with someone random.

313
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,520
Dumb men are my prime targets.

314
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,040
Wow, so clever!

315
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,360
If you were that clever,
you wouldn't be in here yapping with me.

316
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,680
Listen.

317
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,440
If Mom comes to see us tomorrow...

318
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,560
Two of you,

319
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,400
don't tell her about

320
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,720
the fights you've had, okay?

321
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,760
Just sit and say nothing.

322
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,240
Keep your mouth shut, okay?

323
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,720
Understood?

324
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,480
Yes.

325
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,080
Yes, sis.

326
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,080
How's that?

327
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,920
You're as good as you've always been.

328
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,400
Dad?

329
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,840
I'd like to consult you on something.

330
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,520
My girlfriend... got arrested.

331
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,600
I was hoping you could pull some strings

332
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,320
to get her out.

333
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,640
Jade and I are working on her sentence,

334
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,640
but with your assistance, I think...

335
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,520
Hey.

336
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,280
Top, what do you even do with your life?

337
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,120
Aside from...

338
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,200
living your life carelessly

339
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,260
and draining my wallet?

340
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,280
I never blame you for that, do I?

341
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,680
Because I know that's
the only thing you're capable of.

342
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,160
And you came to see me

343
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,000
to ask me to help your girlfriend...

344
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,420
You think you have that much power?

345
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,400
I only took Bell to her graduation party,

346
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,360
and someone stuffed her bag with drugs.

347
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,600
That's why she got arrested.

348
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,800
She doesn't deserve any of this.

349
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,320
So that's why you need my help?

350
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,280
Yes.

351
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,080
So how do you want me to help you?

352
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,560
Help you take her place in jail?

353
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,000
- Dad...
- Do you know

354
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,040
what else they've found aside from drugs?

355
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,400
This!

356
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,040
Your car key.

357
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,320
Do you know how much
I had to pay to get it back?

358
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,480
Also, do you know that

359
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,200
if anyone else finds out about this,

360
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,840
besides you,

361
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,200
who exactly will be in hot water?

362
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,880
It'll be me, damn it!

363
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,000
Jade is one of my men.

364
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,200
I ordered him

365
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,240
to tell your girlfriend to confess.

366
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:12,800
Why did you...

367
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,560
Remember this.

368
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:22,120
The only good thing
you possess in your life is

369
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,160
my surname

370
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,840
attached to your name.

371
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,760
I will not let you

372
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,800
taint my reputation.

373
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,040
So stop thinking about this.

374
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,960
Let your girlfriend

375
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,640
suffer her fate behind bars.

376
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,000
Aw...

377
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,840
I'm going to starve to death tonight.

378
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,840
I should've supplied myself
with snacks from the shop.

379
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,680
I'm sorry.

380
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,160
I made things difficult for you.

381
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,600
I'll treat you to snacks tomorrow.

382
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,840
That's okay.

383
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,880
It's not your fault.

384
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,720
Let's just say I'm fasting, okay?

385
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,160
So I get leaner.

386
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,380
Uh...

387
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,380
Should I apologize to Deedee?

388
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,400
You can try.

389
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,120
She wouldn't dare touch you
during the family visit.

390
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,700
Her boyfriend's coming to see her.

391
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,840
After this, however,

392
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,200
she's gonna continue to beat you up.

393
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,420
Believe me.

394
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,220
What happened, love?

395
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,520
I'll be fine, Pa.

396
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,920
It'll heal soon.

397
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,680
See?

398
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,080
There's no blood.

399
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,320
Right, let's get your blood pressure lowered

400
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,280
so you can tend to the plants tomorrow.

401
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,400
Those are my medicine...

402
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,880
Why do you keep it with you, love?

403
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,800
It's so you can call me more often.

404
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,480
This way, we won't forget each other.

405
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,360
Okay. Open your mouth.

406
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,720
Poor Bell...

407
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,800
Just got here and already getting bullied.

408
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,680
Just like when you first came.

409
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,880
You got it wrong.

410
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,640
Who'd dare hurt me?

411
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,080
I forgot, love.

412
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,400
Who'd dare cross the Rabid Dog?

413
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,040
They'd catch rabies if they did.

414
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,600
You failed your internship?

415
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,640
I've never heard of anyone who did.

416
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,480
They said I was too strict,

417
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,560
and not flexible.

418
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,640
It's not just that, right?

419
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,120
I also had a problem
with the department head.

420
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,140
Just what were you thinking?

421
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,720
You had beef with the department head?

422
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,760
I was assigned to look after
the company's finances.

423
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,400
The numbers were incorrect,

424
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,760
so I issued a report.

425
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,320
They called the head of the department,

426
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,680
and the anger was taken out on me.

427
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,920
This is "not knowing how to play the game."

428
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,120
Some matters are best not brought up.

429
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,560
I think office jobs might not suit you.

430
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,520
How about another line of work?

431
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:48,680
Honey.

432
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,240
If he's this lacking,

433
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,880
no matter the field of work,

434
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,320
he won't be able to go far.

435
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Honey.

436
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,980
You told me that a guard just resigned, right?

437
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,160
Mm...

438
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,200
Just have him work with you.

439
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,720
You'll get to show him the ropes, too.

440
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,760
You want me to become a prison guard?

441
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,200
Oh, right.

442
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,440
This line of work doesn't suit Porches.

443
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,880
You told him to give it a try, didn't you?

444
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,160
How would he know whether or not he likes it?

445
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,760
Just teach him stuff.

446
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,000
Plus, a women's prison
isn't that dangerous, right?

447
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,400
Are you going to let him go on his own,

448
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,400
achieving nothing?

449
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,360
Can't you do this for the sake of our son?

450
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,000
Me? I'm not interested in that job.

451
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,480
Just quit if you don't like it.

452
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,440
No more words.

453
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,280
Oh...

454
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,920
Okay.

455
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,040
I'll look into it.

456
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,280
Yeah, it's simple as that.

457
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,480
Eat well, honey.

458
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,520
Have some of this as well.

459
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,760
Don't forget to eat the fish

460
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,160
so that you talk less.

461
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,920
Oh, sorry!

462
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,080
I mean, so that you...

463
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,600
It's good for your health.

464
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,760
Today is the annual family visit day.

465
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,640
I hope everything goes well.

466
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,000
I know how long
you've been waiting for this day.

467
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,920
So...

468
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,960
Please abide by the rules

469
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,920
so that this occasion
can happen again for years to come.

470
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:26,960
Understood?

471
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,640
Understood!

472
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,480
As you may know,

473
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,320
recently, a guard has been transferred.

474
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:34,960
So...

475
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,040
We needed a new guard in her place.

476
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,320
Please treat him with respect

477
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,000
just like how you do to other guards.

478
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,880
I might not be your type,

479
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,600
but you'll fall for my words!

480
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,480
Hey! Silence!

481
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,880
Stop with the loud noises.

482
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,280
This is a prison,

483
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,860
not your home.

484
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,280
Porches here

485
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,280
is a guard,

486
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,320
not your friend.

487
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,280
Understood?!

488
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,800
Understood.

489
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,400
Wait until a guard
calls your name for the visit.

490
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,080
You may leave now.

491
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,160
Go!

492
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,200
I told you to leave!

493
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,200
Leave!

494
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,000
He's totally my type.

495
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,920
Working here...

496
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,160
Don't tell anyone you're my son.

497
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,200
It'll look bad.

498
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,120
They'll say I cheated you here.

499
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,120
This new guard...

500
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,560
He looks kind of naive, no?

501
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,040
Usually, when Wichai deploys new guards,

502
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,200
he doesn't announce who they are.

503
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,680
Why did he introduce the guy to us?

504
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,460
It's none of your business.

505
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,320
Just behave, okay?

506
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,720
The following is a list of inmates
who have visitors.

507
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,560
If your name is called, proceed to visitation.

508
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,440
Inmate Pia.

509
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,720
Inmate Dao.

510
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,280
Inmate Duen.

511
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,680
Inmate Deedee.

512
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,860
Yes!

513
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,800
Let's go.

514
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,160
- Karakade, the mirror.
- Oh, here you go.

515
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,440
It's right here.

516
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,960
- Do I look pretty?
- You look the best.

517
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,840
I'll make sure I'll dazzle him.

518
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,120
Yes, sis.

519
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,840
Inmate Mathusorn.

520
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,840
Inmate Karakade.

521
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,760
My boyfriend! I'm coming!

522
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,180
Inmate Mangpor.

523
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,960
Inmate Kae.

524
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,120
Over here.

525
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,560
Inmate Wann.

526
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,120
Inmate Beam.

527
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,160
Inmate Som.

528
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,760
['Kai Hua Roh']

529
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,120
Mom!

530
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,000
Come on!

531
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,080
I miss you!

532
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,360
Hello, Auntie.

533
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,360
Deedee, why did you put makeup on?

534
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,440
What's up with you?

535
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,720
Have you been doing well, Mom?

536
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,880
It's been alright.

537
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,520
It's quite a hassle to come here, though.

538
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,080
I had to be driven here.

539
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,760
These two are gonna be out soon.

540
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,080
The request is pending.

541
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,040
As for me, I'll follow a bit later, okay?

542
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,720
Damn you, Dao.

543
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,160
You were freed last time,

544
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,880
and now you're back in here again.

545
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,520
What did you like about this place, huh?

546
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,560
Duen.

547
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,800
Aren't you going to say a word to your mother?

548
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,760
Dao told me

549
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,120
to keep my mouth shut.

550
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,360
I came all the way here,

551
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,280
yet you chose to be quiet?

552
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,120
What's gotten into you, Duen?

553
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,480
Where's my Man, Aunt Shri?

554
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,480
Huh? Hasn't anybody told you?

555
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,680
About what?

556
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,800
Your boyfriend Man found a new girl!

557
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,480
Her name is...

558
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,880
It's Sai or something.

559
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,520
They met on an app called 'Thinner.'

560
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,920
Isn't that for paint?

561
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,040
What? Come on!

562
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,960
News broke, she left, just like that!

563
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,080
You still can't get used to her?

564
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,240
Wait.

565
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,720
If it's not him, then who drove you here?

566
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,880
Boom.

567
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,200
Boom did?!

568
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,240
He can drive now?

569
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,640
Where is he, then?

570
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,560
He's waiting in the car.

571
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:28,770
He said he didn't want to see his mother.

572
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,970
It's just you here again?

573
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:37,160
Mm.

574
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,480
Others are busy.

575
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:40,750
Are they busy or are they avoiding me?

576
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:41,970
Well...

577
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,380
I was just kidding!

578
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,110
You got pale for a bit there.

579
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,080
And... the books I told you to donate here,

580
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,400
have you gotten to them?

581
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,780
The gardening books?

582
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:55,370
The officers just picked them up.

583
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,450
Okay. That's good.

584
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,500
Is this what you're into now?

585
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,980
I can't imagine you planting trees.

586
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,430
Who says it's me?

587
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:09,780
Just do what I say.

588
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:11,710
Don't bother asking me questions.

589
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,840
Honestly, Kae...

590
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,820
Can you just be nice to us for once?

591
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,370
We always give you the cut.

592
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:24,460
You always talk to us like we're not friends.

593
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:34,440
Friends?

594
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:37,740
If we're friends,
why am I the only one behind bars?

595
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:41,950
How about we swap places?

596
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:44,530
Take all of my cut

597
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
and stay here instead of me.

598
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:48,490
How's that sound, huh?

599
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:52,880
Quit saying we're friends.

600
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:57,260
Your job is to give me the monthly cut

601
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,890
and do what I say.

602
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,220
Or else, I'll rat you all out.

603
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:03,820
Understood?

604
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,890
Does he have a girlfriend,

605
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,420
or has he gotten someone pregnant?

606
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,640
What the hell, Duen?!

607
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:17,090
Boom is different from the rest of us.

608
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,620
He's much smarter.

609
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,440
If he's that smart,
why don't you raise him yourself?

610
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,000
It's fine, you raise him.

611
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,730
I have nothing to teach him.

612
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:33,410
Oh? Boom! Come and see your mom.

613
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,690
Damn it! Come on!

614
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:46,930
It's too hot in the car, so I came here.

615
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,100
They don't allow you
to keep the engine running here.

616
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,980
Why would you say that, huh?

617
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,220
That's okay.

618
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,300
Are you doing well, Boom?

619
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:53,610
Pretty well.

620
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,480
Deedee's gone for too long.
I'll go and find her.

621
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,130
I'm sorry.

622
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:06,000
It's been a while, hasn't it?
You've grown!

623
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:13,000
Grandma said you're about to
complete junior high school, right?

624
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,830
Listen. Don't worry.

625
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:16,730
I'll pay for high school.

626
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:17,960
With prison money?

627
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:26,570
I've actually got work here, too, Boom.

628
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,400
I work in the kitchen, and they pay me.

629
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,990
I just couldn't withdraw it yet.

630
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,700
I actually didn't want to come,

631
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:34,010
but someone had to drive Grandma here.

632
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,890
Damn it! How dare you say that?

633
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:39,770
It's fine, Mom.

634
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:44,490
Seeing you already makes me happy.

635
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,040
Boom.

636
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,800
I'm sorry.

637
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:55,570
Sorry for leaving you to Grandma.

638
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:58,120
It's fine.

639
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:01,860
Honestly, living with her is okay.

640
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:08,250
She's a bit grumpy, but don't mind her, okay?

641
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:11,050
She taught me to be a good person

642
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:15,770
and not to cause trouble... like you did.

643
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,280
Let's go, Grandma. I'm hungry.

644
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,290
What's with you?

645
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,130
We just got here.

646
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:26,320
It's okay.

647
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:27,870
It's fine, Mom.

648
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,000
It's too hot in here.
You should go now.

649
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,290
Listen. Come and see me next time, okay?

650
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:53,950
What is it, love?

651
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:58,380
Maybe your son is stuck in traffic.

652
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:00,370
I think so.

653
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,340
I've been waiting for a whole year.

654
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,590
Guess it's fine to wait a little longer.

655
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:14,140
Where are you going?

656
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,690
I'm going to apologize to Deedee,

657
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,010
so that everything clears up.

658
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:20,770
This type of person doesn't let things go.

659
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,200
It's fine.

660
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:24,330
Trust me.

661
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,420
Deedee.

662
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,220
I don't know if I've done something wrong,

663
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,160
but if I made you upset...

664
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,750
I didn't mean to do it.

665
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,210
That's why I want to apologize.

666
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:46,770
You have a death wish, don't you?

667
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:49,650
What makes you think I'd forgive you?

668
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,840
You just met your boyfriend, didn't you?

669
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,940
So I think you'd be in a good mood.

670
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:58,300
What the hell did you say?

671
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,730
You just met your boyfriend, didn't you?

672
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,010
Damn you!

673
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:06,290
He's left me for a new girl.

674
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,970
Why did you have to rub it in, huh?!

675
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:09,890
Oh...

676
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:12,190
Deedee, Deedee...

677
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:14,800
Dao told us not to cause problems.

678
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:16,330
Guards are everywhere.

679
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,660
You won't make it past tonight, Bell.

680
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:20,750
We should go now!

681
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:21,600
Gosh!

682
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,150
Are you alright, love?

683
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,570
Aw...

684
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,580
Are you good?

685
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:33,120
Poor girl.

686
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,020
You should go to the library.

687
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:36,490
Claire should be there.

688
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,410
She can help if you're in trouble.

689
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,540
Sure.

690
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:42,510
It's too dangerous here.

691
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:43,880
Please go, love.

692
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,400
Go to the library.

693
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,740
Phew.

694
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,900
Have a safe trip home, Mom.

695
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:19,390
Babe, eat more food! You're losing weight!

696
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,840
But you're not eating with me!

697
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:21,840
Babe!

698
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:24,590
Don't make that face!
My heart's tearing to pieces!

699
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,700
I'm sorry, babe. I won't do it again.

700
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:28,960
You can have as many girls as you want.

701
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:31,800
You can have a harem, but don't leave me!

702
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:34,190
Babe, you eat with friends,
but I have to eat alone!

703
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,270
Aw, you poor thing, babe.

704
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:37,650
I feel so sorry for you.

705
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:38,960
It's time to leave.

706
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,230
Can we have a bit more time?

707
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,940
Don't be mad at me, babe!

708
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,880
Is your heart still okay?

709
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,120
Babe!

710
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,200
What?!

711
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:48,660
What is it, Duen?

712
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:49,610
We have to go now.

713
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:52,240
You never had a man or something?

714
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,070
Babe, let go!

715
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,590
It's time for me to go!

716
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,370
I refuse!

717
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,770
Babe!

718
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,280
It's getting awkward! Let me go!

719
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,750
Forever!

720
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,830
Mathusorn, I'm counting to ten,
get your ass up!

721
00:38:10,963 --> 00:38:13,623
- Sis! Mathusorn is being a bad girl!
- I'll go after the countdown!

722
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,160
Bell.

723
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:32,670
Can you help me carry books?

724
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,600
We've received a ton of donated books.

725
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,980
- Right now?
- Mm.

726
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,580
What books?

727
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:42,450
I think they're about gardening.

728
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:43,680
Kae's friend donated them.

729
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:48,530
Mm, sure.

730
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,650
Are we good to go?

731
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,110
Come on.

732
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:06,810
Where are the other inmates?

733
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:08,650
Nobody really comes here.

734
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,300
It leads to the old toilet.

735
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,120
Rumor has it that someone heard
a woman scream from there.

736
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,060
Follow me.

737
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,400
Quickly.

738
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:24,560
What are you doing?

739
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,700
Come and help me.

740
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:29,840
We can wait for Kae first.

741
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,100
No need! It's only a few boxes.

742
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:41,090
Look at this. The guards are so lazy.

743
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,520
We need to pick the boxes up ourselves.

744
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:49,640
Whoa, we can't carry
this many books ourselves.

745
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:51,530
Should we get some more helping hands?

746
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:55,970
Mangpor?

747
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,150
Mangpor!

748
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:05,500
Mangpor's gone.

749
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,890
It's just you and me.

750
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,340
Hello!

751
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,650
Whoa.

752
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,970
So it's not just the two of us.

753
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,940
We've got two more.

754
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:24,800
- Hey, where are you going?
- What's the hurry, girl?

755
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:27,220
Where do you think you're going?

756
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,050
Deedee, I'm sorry.

757
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,780
I don't know what I've done.

758
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,950
I'll do anything you want.

759
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,620
I really don't want trouble.

760
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,090
But I do.

761
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:36,700
I wanna beat your sorry ass.

762
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,760
That's for making me get scolded by Dao!

763
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,580
Hold up!

764
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,540
How about a punch in the gut instead?

765
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,490
There.

766
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:52,140
That's for rubbing salt in the wound
about my boyfriend.

767
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:53,010
Pick her up!

768
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,420
- More.
- Sis, wait.

769
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,980
Wait! I think that's enough.
She's learned her lesson.

770
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,190
I'm not done.

771
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,580
- If Dao knows about this...
- There are no cameras here!

772
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,330
The same goes for the guards.

773
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:05,900
How would she know if nobody snitches?

774
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:08,580
Or are you going to tell her yourself?

775
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,890
- Ah!
- Hey! Hey!

776
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:14,020
Blood!

777
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:17,540
Ah! Sis! Here!

778
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:18,780
She scratched me!

779
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:21,210
- Bell! Bell!
- Stop!

780
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:23,600
Come on, girls!

781
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:24,430
Bell! Stop!

782
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:25,340
Mathusorn, what are you doing here?

783
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,230
This way! Come on!

784
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,590
Oh, dear!

785
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:30,380
Follow me!

786
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:52,970
Sis...

787
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,170
Move it!

788
00:41:58,750 --> 00:41:59,920
Go and have a look.

789
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,160
Don't just stand there.
Go inside!

790
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,720
Can I... not go in?

791
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:08,100
I'm scared of ghosts.

792
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:11,740
They say a ghost will follow us if we go in!

793
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:12,590
Ah!

794
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:16,570
You cowards. It's just rumors.

795
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:18,260
Duen, you take the lead.
They'll follow.

796
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:19,930
- Oh, what a relief!
- This way, Duen.

797
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,090
Let's go.

798
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,440
- Ah!
- No...

799
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:34,740
I've also heard loud noises coming from there.

800
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:37,090
We'll all go in at once.

801
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,210
Move it!

802
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:40,810
Okay, moving!

803
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:44,590
Where are you going?

804
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:46,880
It's here!

805
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,160
What? Why'd you jump when you see me?

806
00:42:58,130 --> 00:42:59,370
What happened to your face?

807
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:03,570
I got scratched by a branch in the courtyard.

808
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,080
I was a bit careless.

809
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:05,890
Oh?

810
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:07,620
They look more like nail scratches.

811
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:13,980
Don't let me catch you causing trouble again.

812
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,220
Keep going!

813
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,620
Inside?

814
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:29,340
Out, damn it! Why should we enter the toilet?

815
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:30,330
Come on.

816
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:03,610
How did you get here?

817
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:06,000
You scared me to death.

818
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,440
I borrowed a book only for a bit,

819
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:15,040
and you come all the way here to fetch it?

820
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:27,300
The laugh of a ghost...

821
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:29,740
It came from you?

822
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:39,960
Have a seat.

823
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:44,020
Mm.

824
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:03,620
Capybara.

825
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:06,930
Huh?

826
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:10,700
The cat's name is Capybara.

827
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:23,390
I thought you liked eating cat food.

828
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:25,940
Nonsense.

829
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:28,990
Why would I?

830
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:32,040
Well, it's what they say.

831
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:36,560
They say you love eating cat food,

832
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:40,270
and you're so ruthless that
they all call you Rabid Dog.

833
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:41,970
So am I a dog,

834
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:44,250
or a cat?

835
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:49,900
Want some?

836
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,200
I only eat the crust.

837
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:24,770
Thank you for helping me.

838
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,120
When we were standing in the sun?

839
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:35,790
You fell into me.

840
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:38,440
It would've been too mean not to help, right?

841
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:41,440
That, too.

842
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:47,180
But also, thank you for helping me
when I got jumped by the 3Ds.

843
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,560
Pa'Porn told me that

844
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,840
you told the guard to radio for others.

845
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:07,250
How did someone like you end up in prison?

846
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,850
Actually, I shouldn't end up here.

847
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,250
I studied so hard

848
00:47:19,090 --> 00:47:22,270
and hoped that I'd get a good job

849
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:25,300
so that I could afford
to treat my dad's cancer.

850
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:31,730
Then I graduated...

851
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:34,860
Before I could even
get to attend the ceremony,

852
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,820
I got arrested
because someone planted drugs in my bag.

853
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:48,930
I don't even dare
to tell my dad about all this.

854
00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:52,320
I'm worried he'd get worse.

855
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:08,400
I'm not sleeping, by the way.

856
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,420
I'm just resting my eyes.

857
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,200
Keep going.

858
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:16,590
That's about it.

859
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:24,840
If crying makes you feel better,

860
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,560
just let it out.

861
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:35,780
But if you're done crying,

862
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:48,030
read it for some good laughs.

863
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,360
So you forget those dark times.

864
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,180
Don't cry on the book, though.

865
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,490
I borrowed it.

866
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:07,020
Mm.

867
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:22,350
Hey.

868
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:26,570
You also work on the family visit day?

869
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:28,690
- Huh?
- The packages arrived, you see.

870
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,200
I need to make deliveries,
or I'll lose my credit.

871
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:34,900
It's a dud.

872
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:36,480
Here's one more.

873
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:38,920
There you go.

874
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:43,320
What happened to you?

875
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:45,100
Did Bell...

876
00:49:45,147 --> 00:49:47,017
Hey, that's my cream, right?

877
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,730
I'll take it right now.

878
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:52,800
- Put it away.
- Sure, sis.

879
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:05,690
So?

880
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:08,660
I've heard that the sale's doing well.

881
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:11,000
It doesn't do that well, really.

882
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:15,210
Inmates are prohibited from smoking.

883
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:25,630
I'll catch you later, Mangpor.

884
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:27,610
Right, Dao.

885
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,540
What smoking? I see no cigarettes here.

886
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,000
Exactly.

887
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,250
Nobody's smoking. Are you accusing me?

888
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:41,250
Abusing your power
won't do you good, you know?

889
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:46,980
If you don't stop,
I'll report this to the warden.

890
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:50,250
I've also got something to report.

891
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,640
A male guard entered
the female inmate unit without authorization...

892
00:50:54,666 --> 00:50:57,136
He even came here by himself,
that's against the rules!

893
00:50:57,550 --> 00:50:59,260
I have a female guard with me.

894
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:03,210
Hm, where?

895
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:05,070
Are they under the tub?

896
00:51:05,210 --> 00:51:08,400
Is this against the regulations?

897
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:10,940
He even touched me inappropriately, Dao.

898
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:11,770
Hey!

899
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:12,730
I can vouch for that.

900
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:14,930
Yeah, I saw that with my two eyes.

901
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:17,920
Oh, with this many witnesses,
what would you do?

902
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,580
Your name is Porches, right?

903
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:23,120
You're new here,
you might not know how this place works.

904
00:51:23,470 --> 00:51:26,040
But I think you do now, don't you?

905
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:33,730
- What's wrong with him?
- Don't forget to come to see us again!

906
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,500
- He looked so upset.
- Bye-bye!

907
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,790
Bell! Bell!

908
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,850
Top! Where have you been?

909
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:42,930
You need to help me.

910
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:45,210
Don't worry. I'll find a way to help you.

911
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:54,200
The cops found a ton of drugs in your bag.

912
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:56,360
So they're gonna charge you with...

913
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:00,030
- Drug dealing.
- Drug dealing?!

914
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,820
Where would I even get them from?

915
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:04,080
- I don't even know where they came from.
- I know.

916
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:07,020
In any case, we'll help you
to the fullest extent.

917
00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:11,610
However, we must admit that
trying to get rid of the evidence

918
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:13,600
makes it harder to defend you.

919
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:15,530
You told me to throw them away.

920
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:17,420
Bell...

921
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:18,140
I didn't...

922
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:21,050
They weren't mine. I have no clue.

923
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:24,770
I'm sorry.

924
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:34,330
Tell the cops that you advised me to do it.

925
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:35,440
I have nothing to do with the drugs.

926
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,000
By the way, I'm Jade.

927
00:53:37,810 --> 00:53:38,850
I'm your attorney.

928
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:44,860
If he does that, he will be charged
with obstructing an officer as well.

929
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:49,070
At any rate, you're not free from this case.

930
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:52,130
You should plead guilty.

931
00:53:52,990 --> 00:53:53,900
This will mitigate your sentence.

932
00:53:54,720 --> 00:54:03,560
Sorry, it is not possible to reach
the number you've dialed at this moment.

933
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:12,920
Has anybody come to visit me?

934
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,420
I don't think there's any.

935
00:54:50,683 --> 00:54:53,713
Pa, why are you sitting here all by yourself?

936
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,440
Your son still hasn't arrived?

937
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:00,730
He's still not here.

938
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:03,550
He must've forgotten about me.

939
00:55:04,430 --> 00:55:05,170
Uh...

940
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:08,610
Maybe he's caught up with work
like my boyfriend does.

941
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:11,260
He also couldn't visit.

942
00:55:13,970 --> 00:55:16,640
We can meet them
at regular visit times, right?

943
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:38,210
Inmate Claire, you have a visitor.

944
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:42,430
Please hurry up.
The visitation hour is over soon.

945
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:48,750
Is there anything you'd like to eat?

946
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:00,900
Here, this one's for free.

947
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:01,840
Pa?

948
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:03,610
What do you mean by free?

949
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:05,710
Why not?

950
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:08,450
Just cut it from my wage.

951
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:10,540
I don't spend the money anyway.

952
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:11,840
Are you high or something?

953
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:14,370
You don't even work here anymore.

954
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:16,130
What do you mean by cutting from your wage?

955
00:56:18,350 --> 00:56:19,250
Really?

956
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:44,680
Stop coming here.

957
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:46,970
No matter how many times you ask,

958
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:50,130
my answer is always the same.

959
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:54,760
Well, your answer...

960
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:57,900
It's not reasonable.

961
00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:03,630
That's why I'm serving my sentence.

962
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:04,580
What else do you want?

963
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,660
I want the truth.

964
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:09,870
Perhaps, the answer is dead simple.

965
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,120
I needed money.

966
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:14,360
So I committed robbery.

967
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:17,840
Unfortunately, your brother caught me.

968
00:57:21,090 --> 00:57:22,650
So I had to kill him.

969
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:25,140
That's all.

970
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:26,900
Stop wasting your time.

971
00:57:27,470 --> 00:57:29,560
He won't come back to life anyway.

972
00:57:30,890 --> 00:57:32,590
Go live your life.

973
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:51,250
Bell, I think you should stay away for now.

974
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:52,530
Huh? Why?

975
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:54,530
Trust me. This isn't the time.

976
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:59,040
Guys, a round of applause for our celebrity!

977
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:09,050
I just realized that you're a celebrity.

978
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:14,000
What? You and your boyfriend are on TV, see?

979
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:19,610
I have to admit that the drug case suspect
used to date my son.

980
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:23,930
However, they broke up
before the incident occurred.

981
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:26,280
Therefore, my son and I

982
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:30,200
are not related to the girl's cause of action.

983
00:58:30,370 --> 00:58:32,900
Mr. Top, you really
didn't know about all this before?

984
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:34,270
What's the truth?

985
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:37,010
I found out about it
at the same time as everyone else.

986
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:45,020
After breaking up,
we didn't see each other again.

987
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:49,070
Aw, a breakup broadcast live on TV?

988
00:58:49,310 --> 00:58:50,930
My heart bleeds for you.

989
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:54,540
As a representative of the people

990
00:58:54,690 --> 00:58:55,630
and as a father,

991
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:58,050
I affirm that

992
00:58:58,510 --> 00:59:05,150
I will absolutely not abuse my authority
to protect or assist any criminal.

993
00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:06,900
Please rest assured.

994
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:08,260
That's all I have to say.

995
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:17,740
- Mr. Top!
- Mr. Top! What about...

996
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,330
Mr. Top!

997
00:59:21,026 --> 00:59:21,946
Bell! Bell!

998
00:59:22,146 --> 00:59:22,696
Bell!

999
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,330
- Kae!
- Grab her!

1000
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:27,080
Hey! Deedee! How could you do this?!

1001
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:30,780
Please don't!

1002
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,760
- Fight!
- Stay out of this.

1003
00:59:34,810 --> 00:59:36,580
Fight! Fight!

1004
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:37,890
Kae, it's none of your business.

1005
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,700
I haven't had my revenge
for scratching my face.

1006
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:48,000
What are you doing?!

1007
00:59:50,330 --> 00:59:51,840
A fight broke out. Need backup.

1008
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:54,620
Bell!

1009
00:59:58,670 --> 00:59:59,820
Dao, I didn't do anything.

1010
00:59:59,850 --> 01:00:01,060
You didn't?!

1011
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:05,890
I warned you not to mess
with the Rabid Dog, did I fucking not?!

1012
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,850
We haven't done anything, though.

1013
01:00:08,670 --> 01:00:09,970
You haven't?

1014
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:11,600
Take a good fucking look!

1015
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:14,010
Pa'Porn!

1016
01:00:14,090 --> 01:00:16,010
Pa'Porn! Are you okay?

1017
01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:18,860
She'll definitely come for you
for messing with her people.
