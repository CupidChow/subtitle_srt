1
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:05,880
Hold on.

2
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:07,757
Let me take a look.

3
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:16,266
Jian, are you back from school?

4
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,810
JIAN
17 YEARS OLD

5
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:28,445
The house is perfectly fine.
Why are you breaking it down?

6
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,989
This house is not perfectly fine.

7
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:32,198
On the surface,

8
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,951
yes, it looks fine. Nice and strong.

9
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,037
But it's not strong at all.

10
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:38,580
Especially this room.

11
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:40,290
The roof might fall any second.

12
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:44,544
That's why repair work needs to be done
as soon as possible.

13
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:46,546
Stay somewhere else for two weeks.

14
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:48,631
It will be strong after we repair it.

15
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,426
Okay, whatever.

16
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:52,927
Fine.

17
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,054
Okay!

18
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:57,932
In that case, add a window to my room
while you're at it.

19
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:59,642
What room doesn't have a window?

20
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:00,810
Window?

21
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:01,936
A window.

22
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,438
That'll cost more.

23
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:04,647
Up the price.

24
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,066
Korean beef?

25
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,193
-Okay, I like Korean beef.
- Let's eat that.

26
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:09,360
Okay.

27
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:16,367
You have to pay triple for the window.

28
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,457
I'm sorry, how much?

29
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,126
He's angry.

30
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,629
Pork belly, then.

31
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:29,380
Let's eat pork belly.

32
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,216
Just double, then.

33
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:35,804
All right, fine.

34
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:37,305
Nice.

35
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:38,723
Thank you, sir.

36
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,517
Thank you, sir.

37
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,976
See you later, sir!

38
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,561
We'll see you in two weeks.

39
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:44,729
Thank you, sir.

40
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,150
Where do we stay for two weeks?

41
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:54,697
Jirisan Mountain.

42
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,449
What?

43
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,299
There's... a cave.

44
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:15,885
Why is there a cave here?

45
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,346
What a relief.

46
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,430
That's true.

47
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:21,683
Be careful.

48
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:30,984
NO SIGNAL

49
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:37,657
NO SIGNAL

50
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:38,992
Darn it.

51
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:55,925
You're too...

52
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,262
You're way too hot!

53
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,600
Once the high fever subsides,

54
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:06,936
hypothermia will set in.

55
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:09,898
Damn...

56
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:14,068
I can't believe I'll get hypothermia
in the mountains at night.

57
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,572
This is ridiculous.

58
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,324
Exactly.

59
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:23,036
We should've gone to a hotel or a motel.

60
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,330
Or some nice and quiet campsite.

61
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,123
Why explore this mountain?

62
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,374
You even hurt your leg!

63
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,294
That's my hurt leg.

64
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,762
Listen up, Jian.

65
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,556
When you're in a difficult situation,

66
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,309
instead of arguing over right and wrong,

67
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,103
it's important to find a way

68
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,231
to solve the problem

69
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,608
and overcome the situation.

70
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,235
Okay?

71
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,238
What the heck?

72
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,031
Are you lecturing me now?

73
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,494
We don't even know where we are.

74
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:11,709
What's that?

75
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,712
You had a map?

76
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:15,964
-I think

77
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:17,882
- this is where we are.
Okay.

78
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:22,220
So if you walk
five or six kilometers this way,

79
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,847
there will be a shelter
with an emergency phone.

80
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:27,684
Can you

81
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,727
get there on your own?

82
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,069
I have to.

83
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,990
You'll become one with Mother Nature
if I don't.

84
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:43,241
Right.

85
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:44,575
I love nature.

86
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,661
That wouldn't be so bad.

87
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,413
It sounds good to me too.

88
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:49,872
I'll get to live on my own.

89
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,711
Right, Jian. Hold on.

90
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,131
Just in case,

91
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,049
take this with you.

92
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,637
What's so funny?

93
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:08,224
Do you know how many wild boars
are in this mountain?

94
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,892
What if you run into one?

95
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:11,769
Wild boars are scary.

96
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,605
If they're hungry and have nothing to eat,

97
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,316
they try to eat humans too.

98
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,067
What are you doing?

99
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,528
Are you trying to scare your rescuer?

100
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,113
Are you scared?

101
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:23,906
Of course not!

102
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:27,785
I should run away if I meet a boar.
How will this help?

103
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,665
If you think you're in danger,

104
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,250
shout out my name

105
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,836
at the sky three times.

106
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,589
"Jeong Jinman,
Jeong Jinman, Jeong Jinman!"

107
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,175
Then...

108
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,802
I might just show up.

109
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:48,890
What a load of bull.

110
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:52,810
Uncle.

111
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,854
I clearly saw you sweat a lot.

112
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,564
Are you sure you're sick?

113
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,777
I'm burning up!

114
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,404
Come on.

115
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,407
Don't you remember when you were little?

116
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,160
When the bullies at school locked you up,

117
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,412
you shouted my name

118
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,706
and I magically appeared.

119
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,460
No, I don't remember.

120
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,049
Anyway,

121
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:25,093
leave this if you don't need it.

122
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,177
Wait!

123
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,235
Wait here.

124
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,695
I'll call for help and be right back.

125
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,158
Be careful, okay?

126
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,243
Okay!

127
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:10,596
Hey.

128
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,391
Pasin, it's me.

129
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,229
The drugs are incredible.

130
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:24,986
Yes.

131
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:26,988
Jian is on her way down.

132
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:30,992
Okay.

133
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,745
We should let her decide herself.

134
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,985
Is this the right path?

135
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,383
I found it.

136
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,317
<i>Only the weak bark.</i>

137
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,113
The strong don't.

138
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,118
You must become strong.

139
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,956
<i>Whatever makes you scared,</i>
<i>keep your eyes open and face it.</i>

140
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,256
You were sweating with a fever.

141
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,341
What's going on?

142
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,927
I didn't have to climb down alone.

143
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,932
Nature must've healed me quickly.

144
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,518
I think nature fits me well.

145
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:28,312
And your leg?

146
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,482
It still hurts.

147
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:34,068
You saw me limping earlier.

148
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,827
And where on earth
did you get that kind of gun?

149
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,163
It was in the backpack.

150
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,331
Pasin lent it to me.

151
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,586
Why does he have a gun to begin with?

152
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,383
Wait.

153
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:02,304
So you had a real gun,

154
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:06,434
but you gave me a slingshot?

155
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,981
What kind of uncle are you?

156
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:15,443
That's because you don't know
how to use a gun.

157
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,263
A gun?

158
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,140
Where did you get that?

159
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,309
Isn't it illegal?

160
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,272
Do you want to try it?

161
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,491
Listen up, Jian.

162
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:49,286
Guns are double-edged swords.

163
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:51,956
With this gun,

164
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,917
you can protect yourself,

165
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,962
and you can save your companions.

166
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,841
But someone always gets killed by it.

167
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:03,551
Keep that in mind.

168
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,429
This is the magazine.

169
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,139
This is the barrel.

170
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,100
This is the slide.

171
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,768
Inside is the bolt.

172
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:13,978
Okay.

173
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:16,397
That's the recoil spring,
and that's the frame.

174
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:34,665
Align your sights.

175
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,208
Take a deep breath.

176
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:43,716
A SHOP FOR KILLERS

177
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,888
EPISODE 3
THE STRONG DON'T HOWL

178
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,265


179
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:00,774


180
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,069
Are you okay?

181
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,116
Jeongmin, snap out of it!

182
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,576
Do you want to die here?

183
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,087
Shit.

184
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,672
They've pulled out all the stops.

185
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:35,596
This... isn't right.

186
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,308
We have to get out.

187
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,273
Jeongmin.

188
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:02,915
Who are you?

189
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:07,669
Bae Jeongmin. I... I'm Jian's friend.

190
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,388
What did you just...

191
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,408
Was it you

192
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,244
that tried to kill us?

193
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:42,412
What's that?

194
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:44,832
A slingshot?

195
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,637
Let go of me!

196
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,265
Let go! Let go of me!

197
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:02,850
Let go!

198
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,355
You move without thinking.
You're the opposite of your uncle.

199
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:12,025
But you better think and move
like your uncle from now on.

200
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,069
If you want to survive.

201
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,814
What the hell's going on?

202
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,025
Is someone with her?

203
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:57,154
Shit. I could've taken her out
with my first shot.

204
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:58,572
Come on, Seongjo.

205
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:01,783
If you did that, what's the point
of having all the guys here?

206
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,163
Right?

207
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,540
- I should give them a chance too.
- Of course.

208
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,627
Have this and keep it up.

209
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,087
Let's get something nice to eat
when we're done.

210
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,645
I'm not here to fight you.

211
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,355
I'm here to protect you.

212
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,023
Who are you?

213
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,442
What did you do to Jeongmin?

214
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,320
Don't worry. He's not dead.

215
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,199
Think about it, Jian.

216
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,243
Didn't you find it strange?

217
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:47,412
"Shout 'Jeong Jinman'
at the sky three times."

218
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:55,295
You've done it just three times
in the last ten years.

219
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:58,924
When you were bullied by a girl
in middle school,

220
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,134
when you were sexually harassed,

221
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:02,761
and this year.

222
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:05,889
Your boss at the convenience store
that tried to stiff you.

223
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,683
What happened to them all?

224
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,479
You probably don't know,

225
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,190
but there's a code implanted
in your forearm.

226
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,360
You and your uncle
are the only two green codes.

227
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:24,283
Whoever received a code has a duty
to protect you, Jeong Jian.

228
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:28,745
That's why everyone was mobilized
when you shouted his name.

229
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:32,040
That girl in your class was transferred.

230
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,043
The pervert from college dropped out.

231
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,796
And your boss had an accident, right?

232
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:39,756
Darn it.

233
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,800
What on earth...

234
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,468
What the hell are you saying?

235
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,845
You saw just now,

236
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:46,805
the drones trying to kill you.

237
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,142
<i>I repeat.</i>

238
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:54,688
<i>Please evacuate to a safe location</i>
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

239
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,774
<i>Let me repeat myself once more.</i>

240
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,736
<i>Until 18:00 hours today,</i>

241
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:04,156
<i>live firearm training</i>
<i>will be conducted on base.</i>

242
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:07,617
<i>- It will cause some dust and...</i>
-Even the military is helping.

243
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,619
Seongjo must've pulled some strings.

244
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:14,458
All right, let's go if you're ready.

245
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:19,004
Mr. Kim, it's a house with one girl.

246
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:20,630
Isn't this overkill?

247
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:24,301
I know she's Jeong Jinman's niece,
but she's just a 21-year-old kid.

248
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,053
Right.

249
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,972
I hope you're right.

250
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:30,640
But I don't know.

251
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:34,227
Team members.

252
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,605
Follow my instructions from now on.

253
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:38,899
In an emergency,

254
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:43,070
if you decide to break away and die
from your own judgement,

255
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:47,824
you'll be departing this life
for chump change

256
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:52,204
with no insurance and no one to blame.

257
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:55,082
So keep that in mind and try to keep up.

258
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,500
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

259
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:02,089
One, two. Testing. Mic test.

260
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:04,132
<i>Seongjo, can you hear me?</i>

261
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:07,469
Yes, loud and clear.

262
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,660
Don't move and stay there!

263
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,469
What the hell?

264
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,012
How could that be there?

265
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,393
Jeez...

266
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,112
Hey, it's me.

267
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,448
I think someone's helping the kid.

268
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,369
Damn it, there's too much smoke.

269
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:17,289
I can't see anything.
Can you clear out the smoke?

270
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:18,915
Please?

271
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,043
God damn it.

272
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,042
Minhye?

273
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,211
My, my.

274
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:29,903
Minhye?

275
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:36,243
This changes everything.

276
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:39,454
Everyone, wait!

277
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,541
What the hell is Minhye doing there?

278
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:45,627
<i>Seongjo? Is that Minhye</i>
<i>in the rabbit hole?</i>

279
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,964
Minhye's Class S
holding Codes Red and Purple.

280
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,925
You'll have to pay more for risk.

281
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:55,554
Fine, just proceed.

282
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,347
We don't have much time.

283
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:01,268
Then, I'll trust you and proceed.

284
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,687
- Let's proceed.
- Yes, sir.

285
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:05,188
Yes, sir.

286
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:09,150
God damn it. Everyone's all about money.

287
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:10,777
Seongjo?

288
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,987
Who's Minhye?

289
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:15,574
Just a crazy bitch.

290
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,626
Now, let's begin the rabbit hunt!

291
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:14,007
Teams 1 and 2 of Group 1
has begun the rabbit hunt.

292
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,384
Fifteen hundred meters to the rabbit.

293
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,477
Come back alive!

294
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,607
<i>Focus.</i>

295
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:16,403
<i>Listen up, Jian.</i>

296
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,531
<i>Blind spots.</i>

297
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:51,706
<i>It's flying in from the left side.</i>

298
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:53,500
<i>A diagonal direction?</i>

299
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:58,087
<i>The sound of the gunshot came</i>
<i>from much higher and farther away.</i>

300
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:21,736
What?

301
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,739
Where did she go?

302
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:29,911
- Hey, Bongo.
- Yes?

303
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,120
Go forward a bit.

304
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,580
Going forward a bit.

305
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:48,847
One.

306
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:51,724
Two.

307
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:53,685
Three.

308
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:33,725
Have you shot a gun before?

309
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:37,854
Yes.

310
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:40,690
Not that one.

311
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:03,796
When it comes to shooting,
pistols and rifles are the same anyway.

312
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,133
Pull the lever on the right
and insert the bullet.

313
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:09,761
You just need to load it.

314
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,704
What the fuck?

315
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,332
Look at this bitch!

316
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:42,961
She's Jeong Jinman's niece indeed!

317
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:08,027
I can't believe he stuck a gun
under the sofa.

318
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:10,655
That's just like
my dear Jinman.

319
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:13,825
Your what?

320
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:17,286
What... do we do now?

321
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,504
The impatient always die first.

322
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,760
God damn it!

323
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:36,347
Minhye, that bitch.
How much is she getting paid?

324
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,111
There's no time.

325
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,989
I'll cover you. Go into the storage shed.

326
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:54,866
The storage shed?

327
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:57,744
Yes, on the floor
of your uncle's workroom,

328
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:59,579
there's a door into murthehelp.

329
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:04,250
I'm going to protect you
until you get in there safely.

330
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:05,626
I promised your uncle.

331
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,423
How can I trust you?

332
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:12,467
Why should I listen to you?

333
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,344
Aren't you curious

334
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,597
as to who your uncle really was?

335
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:30,985
Go right now!

336
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,091
Look at that.

337
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:54,926
Mr. Kim?

338
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:58,429
The rabbits are moving
towards the storage shed.

339
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:01,265
Get a move on, will you?

340
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:03,810
We just have to go through there.
Can you do it?

341
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:05,978
Let's go.

342
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:17,824
I knew it.

343
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,700
There it is.

344
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:26,874
Jeongmin, get up!

345
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,099
Got you.

346
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,875
That little bitch.

347
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,506
Where my uncle worked?

348
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,337
What is this?

349
00:36:57,673 --> 00:37:00,384
What is it? Try his birthday.

350
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:02,762
His birthday? Birthday...

351
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:09,894
My birthday?

352
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,156
Damn it! What is it?

353
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,991
Hurry up, Jian!

354
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:27,995
<i>Listen up, Jian.</i>

355
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,873
It's the same with your school ID number.

356
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:32,875
2-2-0-1-9-0-7-4.

357
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:36,128
2-2-0-1-9-0-7-4.

358
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:39,966
2-2-0-1-9-0-7-4.

359
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:51,727
It worked.

360
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,416
What?

361
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:39,668
It's really here.

362
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,068
Jian.

363
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,368
Oh... Hi, Jeong Jian.

364
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:23,170
I'm Brother.

365
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:29,051
A SHOP FOR KILLERS
