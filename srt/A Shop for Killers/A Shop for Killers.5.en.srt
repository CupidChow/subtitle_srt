1
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:15,557
What the fuck? Just my luck.

2
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:30,155
Hello.

3
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:36,870
I...

4
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:40,248
I saw your part-time job ad.

5
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,252
STORAGE ORGANIZATION
AND SIMPLE TASKS

6
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:45,837
My name is Bae Jeongmin.

7
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:47,589
I know who you are.

8
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,341
I went to elementary school with Jian.

9
00:00:53,636 --> 00:01:00,602
A SHOP FOR KILLERS

10
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,857
EPISODE 5
BABYLON

11
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,485
How does this even work?

12
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,030
I wasn't talking to you.

13
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:19,204
How many times do I have to tell you?
Seriously.

14
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,416
Do you know how many times I almost died?

15
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,545
Anyway, I'm inside.

16
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,258
You saw the picture of Jian, right?

17
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:36,763
I'll activate murthehelp's source
and get it to you today.

18
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:38,932
Handing over this shopping mall
in just three days.

19
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,185
I'm the number one contributor to that.

20
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:50,944
What?

21
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:52,904
You want me...

22
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:55,782
to kill her?

23
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:03,832
What?

24
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,751
You've come this far
and now you can't do it?

25
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,421
Is that all you're made of?

26
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,488
What do you mean?

27
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,242
You locked me in?

28
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:42,704
What?

29
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,331
That's what you just said.

30
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,584
When we were younger,

31
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,253
you were the one that locked me
in the storage room.

32
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:55,758
Oh, that?

33
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,141
Jeong Jinman!

34
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,060
Jeong Jinman!

35
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,192
I was just curious...

36
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:17,155
if you were really a mute or not.

37
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:19,574
So I talked some friends
into locking you in.

38
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:22,493
I thought you'd be able to speak
in an extreme situation.

39
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:25,997
You should be thanking me.

40
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,374
You overcame your aphasia, thanks to me.

41
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,761
You're confused, aren't you?

42
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:43,514
You must be confused
about what's going on.

43
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:44,599
Am I right?

44
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:50,813
Something you could've never imagined
is happening. It's understandable.

45
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,692
What the hell are you saying?

46
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,950
Don't you want to know?

47
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,662
About what's going on right now.

48
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,044
There's a place called Babylon.

49
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,007
You moron.

50
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:20,760
There aren't any killers in our country.

51
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,680
You saw the deep web site.

52
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,598
Weapons were being traded.

53
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,850
An AK-47 was being sold
for 1.2 million won.

54
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,978
So will you buy it if you have the money?

55
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:34,232
You were discharged from the military
for hardship. What will you do with an AK?

56
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,568
You were in operations.
Can you even shoot a gun?

57
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,779
Jeez. What do you even know?

58
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,785
Hey, I'm serious.
The quality of the site was different.

59
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:49,163
It was recovered
five minutes after I hacked it.

60
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,416
There's something suspicious about it.

61
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:52,750
Come on!

62
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,920
The better the quality,
the higher the chance it's a fake.

63
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,131
What's wrong with you? Are you an amateur?

64
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,884
Amateur?

65
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,890
Then, what's a pro like?

66
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:13,730
We attend a no-name college.
We're not pros.

67
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,148
We're fucking losers.

68
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,318
These days, there are so many hackers

69
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,695
trying to land a sweet job
at a major company.

70
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,613
A true black hat hacker in our country?

71
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,532
They've all given in.

72
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,410
They pretend to be black,
but they're all white.

73
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,203
Wait and see.

74
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,498
I'll show you
what a real black hat hacker is.

75
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,755
Hey, forget it. You'll end up in jail.

76
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,966
Are you scared of going to jail?

77
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,052
Of course!

78
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,553
-I'm so scared!
-Cut it out.

79
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:54,103
Just live the rest of your life
eating meat on a stick.

80
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,732
What's wrong with that?

81
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,275
ENTER PASSWORD

82
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,778
What was the name of that site?

83
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,030
"Murthehelp"?

84
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,199
My God.

85
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,622
What the hell? What a jerk.
Who smokes inside these days?

86
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,675
Fuck.

87
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,969
The jerk kept giving us dirty looks.

88
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,638
Shall we go down and fight him?

89
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,265
Guys like him need a good beating.

90
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:32,975
I haven't felt this heated in...

91
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,060
What's wrong?

92
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:41,567
Huh?

93
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,030
Was it you?

94
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:48,950
Did you hack murthehelp?

95
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:29,699
One minute left.

96
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,939
This is crazy.

97
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:12,950
I did it!

98
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:37,099
Wait. Hold on. I can do it
if you give me a little more time!

99
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,684
I'm almost there. I really...

100
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,000
By the way...

101
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,463
Are you going to get rid of the body?

102
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,684
That's when I realized
I was different from ordinary people.

103
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,398
I told you to tell me about my uncle.

104
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,150
-Is this an autobiography?
-Hmm-mmm.

105
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,904
All of this is connected, you see.

106
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,782
Just be patient and listen.

107
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:38,911
Do you know this man?

108
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,251
What about her?

109
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,035
I'm so sorry.

110
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,913
I wasn't like this
during my military service.

111
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,458
I haven't worked out properly
since I was discharged.

112
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,709
Sure, rest a little.

113
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,004
Okay.

114
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,507
I really should work out.

115
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,610
Why is it turned?

116
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,321
Shit.

117
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,413
What is this?

118
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,754
It's hot as hell in here.

119
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:17,635
Damn it.

120
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:20,346
I want to take a shower so bad. Fuck.

121
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,644
What the hell is supposed to be in here?

122
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:27,770
What?

123
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,441
Oh... It's nothing.

124
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,570
Drink this.

125
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,155
Thank you.

126
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,538
How's Jian doing?

127
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:50,376
We were quite close in elementary school.

128
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:12,189
YOU'VE GOT ONE DAY LEFT

129
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,859
God damn it...

130
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:28,372
Boss?
I have to take a dump.

131
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,750
Can I use the bathroom in the house?

132
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:35,045
Thank you.

133
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:32,645
What are you looking for?

134
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:05,886
Hey.

135
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:07,847
Did I scare you?

136
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,559
When Jian's at home
and I'm in the storage shed,

137
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,727
it's a hassle to walk back and forth,

138
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,437
so I had a speaker installed.

139
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,022
Oh...

140
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,817
I was just taking a look around.

141
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,987
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay. That's no problem.

142
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:25,364
By the way,

143
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,242
you major in computer engineering?

144
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,374
Yes, computer engineering.

145
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,252
That's great.

146
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,922
I think my computer's broken.

147
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,632
Can you repair it for me?

148
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,595
I'll add the repair fees to your paycheck.

149
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:52,766
Sure.

150
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,904
SCANNING IN PROGRESS...

151
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,864
I think it's infected with malware.

152
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:10,200
I'll format it first and try to save
all the files that I can.

153
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,537
Okay. Thanks.

154
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:18,375
Then, how much should I pay you
for the repairs?

155
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,502
That's not necessary.

156
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,588
Jian and I were really close.

157
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,466
-I can do this for free...
-In what grade?

158
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,470
Pardon?

159
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,767
I've never seen
any of Jian's friends before.

160
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,895
So I was wondering
when you became friends.

161
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,690
Well... When we were really young.

162
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,108
In the second grade.

163
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:48,405
She was so rude as a kid
that she had no friends.

164
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:55,663
You know, Jian couldn't speak
very well back then.

165
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,539
I helped her out quite a lot.

166
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,591
And I don't know if you remember,

167
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,843
but she was once locked in the school...

168
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,637
Yes, that's right.

169
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,348
Then, I'll buy you dinner after.

170
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,977
I'm going to go clean up.
Come when you're done.

171
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,478
Okay.

172
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:20,980
I will.

173
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:40,666
That was easy.

174
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,227
It smells like manure. Fuck.

175
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,022
Who knew I'd go back to that neighborhood?

176
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,403
When will this finish?

177
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,331
ARE YOU DONE YET?

178
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:24,585
Jeong Jinman needs to access it
before I can do anything.

179
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,464
They're such morons.

180
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,631
WAIT A LITTLE LONGER

181
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,056
He's on.

182
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,452
There you go.

183
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,459
It worked.

184
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:15,886
What is this?

185
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,499
GREAT JOB

186
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,079
Fuck.

187
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:25,998
Listen carefully.

188
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,668
If you kill me like this,
it'll all be in vain.

189
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:31,962
That's how I set it up.

190
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,144
Bang.

191
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,575
It's me, Lee Yonghan.

192
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,703
You've got some balls, kid.

193
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,707
I needed my insurance.

194
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,543
If you kill me,

195
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,837
murthehelp will reset,

196
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,839
and you won't be able to access it.

197
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,634
I made it so that only I can do it.

198
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:26,266
Take care of him.

199
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,144
Wait! Wait a second.

200
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,312
Wait.

201
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,439
You saw me in action.

202
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,067
I'm good at this.

203
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,402
I'm smart, and I'm good at hacking.

204
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,196
What is it that you want?

205
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,406
Jeong Jinman?

206
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,158
Or these weapons?

207
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,494
I have...

208
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,290
a really sick plan.

209
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:01,927
Let's hear it.

210
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,056
In the end,
it all went according to plan.

211
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,526
What?

212
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:20,362
So embarrassing.
Why does it have to start here?

213
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,485
Huh?

214
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,404
What the hell?

215
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:05,866
So that stuttering moron was bluffing.

216
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:08,577
I thought there'd be something on here.

217
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:12,956
You can't find out the truth of that day
with that.

218
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:19,171
Aren't you curious, Jian?

219
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:21,757
Watch closely,

220
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,301
how I killed your uncle.

221
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:40,525
Save me, Uncle.

222
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:42,944
I don't know where I am right now!

223
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,323
Fuck, let me go!

224
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,201
Save me, Uncle.

225
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:51,995
I don't know where I am right now!

226
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,208
If you kill me,

227
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,335
your niece, Jeong Jian...

228
00:22:58,418 --> 00:22:59,503
Save me, Uncle.

229
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:02,672
-Babylon will kill her.
-I don't know where I am right now!

230
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:05,425
Untie me while I'm asking nicely!

231
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,261
Now!

232
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,598
Damn it!

233
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:12,974
Save me, Uncle.

234
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,769
I don't know where I am right now!

235
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:27,781
I'll do as you say.

236
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,119
Let Jian go right away as you promised.

237
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,830
Yes, of course.

238
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,707
Trust is so important
in this line of work.

239
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,710
As you know very well. Right?

240
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,213
Untie me now.

241
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:52,597
Pasin.

242
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:55,350
You don't have to pay me back.

243
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,112
Jeong Jinman!

244
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:09,239
You have to put me down!

245
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,283
Hey, fucker!

246
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,368
Hey! Shit.

247
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:26,923
Tell Babylon...

248
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:31,261
to keep their promise.

249
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,556
Nod if you understand.

250
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:09,716
Damn it.

251
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,085
A work of art, right?

252
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,921
How did you get my voice?

253
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:16,217
I've never said that before.

254
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,803
That's a deepfake. It's so common now.

255
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:23,058
I can make it in less than ten minutes
with your voice clip.

256
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:27,520
And your convenience store boss helped
with the voice recording.

257
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:29,356
Watch.

258
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,860
Jeong Jian has shit for brains

259
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:38,490
Jeong Jian has shit for brains

260
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:44,287
And your uncle was so...

261
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:47,457
Jeong Jinman was supposed to be amazing.

262
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,669
But he fell for such a lame trick
and killed himself.

263
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:52,796
No!

264
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:54,964
No!

265
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:57,926
When the almighty Babylon was

266
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,763
being so careful,
I was quite scared to be honest.

267
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,559
But it turned out, it was nothing.

268
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,186
It was so lame

269
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:10,814
and so easy.

270
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:13,817
But then, it means

271
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,486
I'm that capable, right?

272
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:20,573
I got something so difficult done
so easily.

273
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,494
Maybe they chose me for a reason.

274
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,120
What is it?

275
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:10,623
You're just a minion
pretending to be clever.

276
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,126
Are you talking about me?

277
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:17,672
Babylon?

278
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,926
I doubt they'll keep you alive.

279
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,429
They'll kill you
as soon as you get out of here.

280
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,390
No, wait.

281
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:32,061
If you kill me,
I bet that woman will kill you first.

282
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:33,646
Will you be okay?

283
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,151
Hey.

284
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:41,404
I don't think you're in any position
to piss me off.

285
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:43,698
Babylon just told me

286
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,200
to kill you.

287
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,326
Hey!

288
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:47,911
Don't you remember?

289
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:50,705
You're the one that told me.

290
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:54,459
"Everyone with a code
has a duty to protect Code Green."

291
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,711
Since my uncle's dead,

292
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,172
I'm the only Code Green left.

293
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,470
I don't know what my uncle has been up to,

294
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,515
but judging by the scale,

295
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:12,852
I bet there are more people
who will try to protect me.

296
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,647
What the hell are you saying?

297
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,899
Think if you've got a brain.

298
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:22,487
There's no one from Babylon here.
They don't care if you die.

299
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,948
Didn't you see the drones
that tried to kill us?

300
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:26,449
You're just

301
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,077
expendable to them.

302
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:34,916
The only Code Green is me in front of you.

303
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:37,669
They aren't the ones you need

304
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:40,296
to make a deal with.

305
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:42,715
It's me.

306
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:44,217
Watch it!

307
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:49,138
You're tied up. Who are you to lecture me?

308
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,184
Also,

309
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:57,105
why would I make a deal with you?

310
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,566
Jeong Jinman is dead.

311
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:03,444
Are you trying to act like
murthehelp is yours now?

312
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:07,323
You didn't even know who your uncle was
just a few hours ago.

313
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:10,493
Hey.

314
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,245
Look at that.

315
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:15,748
They can fly their drones,
send in all those old morons,

316
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:17,166
and shoot all they want.

317
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,085
But I'm the one that made it here

318
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:22,046
and captured you. Me!

319
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,008
Right.

320
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:29,512
You were wailing and crawling
around our hallway for this?

321
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,515
Thank God you didn't wet yourself.

322
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,934
You only got this far to save yourself

323
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:37,604
because Babylon had a gun to your head,
you coward!

324
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,733
What are you on about, you mute.

325
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:43,651
Scared assholes

326
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,738
bark like little bitches in groups!

327
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:49,073
Just like you and the assholes up there!

328
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,418
I dare you to keep talking.

329
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,059
That crazy bitch.

330
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:35,972
Jian?

331
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:39,851
Jeong Jian!

332
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,979
You didn't become a mute again, did you?

333
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:47,150
You need to use everything
around you in times of crisis.

334
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:50,570
Use whatever means necessary to survive.

335
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,489
I have to do whatever I can.

336
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,164
What the fuck?

337
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:05,043
I almost killed Jeong Jian so many times.
You don't want me to kill her now?

338
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:08,254
What if I actually killed her earlier?

339
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:11,966
Is this the best you can do?

340
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,551
You little...

341
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:20,183
They want face recognition now?
Are you kidding me?

342
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,101
What?

343
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:48,503
Why are you so late, you punk?

344
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,385
Hello!

345
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:57,970
Are you late because of that?

346
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:01,015
I wanted to get this for you,
but there's nothing but mountains.

347
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,643
-It wasn't easy getting it.
-You little punk.

348
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:07,188
Don't hate me too much.

349
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,567
Your uncle wasn't that great
of a person either.

350
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:13,820
Jeong Jinman

351
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:16,155
probably killed a lot of people.

352
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,454
And Jian.

353
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,666
This world we're living in...

354
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,003
It's not about being good or bad.

355
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,422
It's about being strong or weak.

356
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:38,302
And Jeong Jinman, who was
at the top of the food chain,

357
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:41,514
died from the trap I set.

358
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:47,436
That means

359
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:50,523
I'm stronger than Jeong Jinman.

360
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:55,736
Do you think you can run away from...

361
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:06,789
Fuck! Seriously?

362
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,041
Jian.

363
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,127
Fuck!

364
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,545
Jeong Jian!

365
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:15,673
Please!

366
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:18,759
Jian.

367
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:20,720
Jian!

368
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,897
Jian... Jian, wait.

369
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:33,691
You can't compare to my uncle at all.

370
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:48,414
Jian... Jian.

371
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,128
You have to think this through.

372
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,923
You should take my side.

373
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:02,386
If the strong fight the strong,
they break like your uncle.

374
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:04,764
The weak

375
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:08,434
must know their place and choose wisely.

376
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,978
You dummy.

377
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,442
Yeah, right.

378
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:34,669
Still, how could you leave
Jian there alone?

379
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:37,421
She needs to solve
all the problems by herself.

380
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,800
That's how she'll learn to survive.

381
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:42,218
It's what the boss wanted.

382
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,096
Don't worry.

383
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:48,015
Jeong Jian isn't weak at all.

384
00:37:58,025 --> 00:37:59,777
They'll start to attack again.

385
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,822
Is this all you brought?

386
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:06,242
Only 12 bullets?

387
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:11,205
After what happened with Bale,
the boss said

388
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:14,125
an attack like this
could happen at any time.

389
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:17,086
Also, in order to defend ourselves
at any given time,

390
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:19,797
he remodeled the house.

391
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,091
So...

392
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:29,682
What are you doing?

393
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:02,089
It's so refreshing.

394
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:05,009
This hits the spot during times like this!

395
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:06,969
But you didn't have to get this for me.

396
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:10,765
I've been craving sweet things lately
for some reason.

397
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:12,475
Have you saved up?

398
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:15,853
Working at a company
fucking sucks these days.

399
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:19,690
So I'm thinking of
starting my own business

400
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,609
like you.

401
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:26,572
You know, they say that
the office is a battlefield,

402
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:28,574
but outside is hell.

403
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:30,993
I can relate to that completely.

404
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:32,828
Fuck, since I'm on my own now,

405
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:35,539
I have to pay for every bullet
with my own money.

406
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,041
It's fucking awful.

407
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:41,253
While you belong to Babylon,
nothing you do is illegal.

408
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:42,338
That's true.

409
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:44,173
Stay there for as long as you can.

410
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:48,094
You're right. I should.
I had the wrong idea. Damn it.

411
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:49,178
Crap.

412
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,347
By the way,

413
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:54,600
it seems Mr. Kim's dead.
I think Minhye got him.

414
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,144
That wretched bitch.

415
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:00,189
Damn.

416
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:03,609
You tuned your ride. Does it run well?

417
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:06,320
Well, I bought it used.

418
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:09,031
It drives so well.
And it's nice and rugged.

419
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:12,493
PERFECT WASH

420
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,539
DO NOT ENTER

421
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:20,960
They're here.

422
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,005
"Bubble Car Wash..."

423
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:29,051
That looks so cheap.
Why does it have to be a car wash?

424
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:32,304
Wow.

425
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,015
Are you sleeping?

426
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,184
It's smaller than I thought.

427
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,104
Whoa!

428
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:52,408
Is it warming up or something?

429
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:59,331
These things are a problem.

430
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,667
You shouldn't approve of these things.

431
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,962
They're going to steal our jobs later.

432
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:09,258
It's not as great as I thought.
It's kind of lame. Don't you think?

433
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,147
I'll start the attack.

434
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:51,800
Damn, I think it can steal our jobs
right this minute.

435
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,386
What are you all doing? Get to it.

436
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,517
All right. Group 2, can you hear me?

437
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:03,270
Don't kill Jeong Jian. Capture her alive.

438
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:07,650
It's fine if you break
an arm or a leg, though.

439
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:09,276
All right.

440
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,444
Beware of Minhye.

441
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:12,446
I'll see you all alive!

442
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:29,004
On the surface,

443
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,590
it may look like an ordinary house,

444
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:33,968
but each space can be used for defense.

445
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:35,844
If we use this well,

446
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:39,598
no one will be able to enter.

447
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:53,112
What's that?

448
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,116
Kuma.

449
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:58,200
Hurry up.

450
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,331
Run! Enter the house!

451
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:16,510
Unless we're hit by a missile,
we're going to survive.

452
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:22,349
Darn it.

453
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:25,227
Then, how will you stop that?

454
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,312
What?

455
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:41,619
Come inside, Minhye!

456
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,161
Wow.

457
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:28,207
We'll be able to get inside at least,
thanks to you.

458
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:29,291
Great job.

459
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:32,670
Go in or not?

460
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:35,964
For fuck's sake, can we go inside or not?

461
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:38,133
Go inside.

462
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:41,512
Why the hell did he have to cuss?

463
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,851
What the hell kind of shutter is this?

464
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:49,603
Hold on.

465
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:51,897
How did you get in here?

466
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:14,503
What the hell?

467
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:16,880
Shit, are we trapped?

468
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:18,799
Don't worry.

469
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:20,300
Hey, don't be scared.

470
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:21,510
Don't be scared.

471
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:25,431
Shit, when did Jeong Jinman prepare
something like that?

472
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:27,683
Of course.

473
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:31,311
You would never
make things easy for us. Right?

474
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:33,147
Motherfucker.

475
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:37,651
Do something about that.

476
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:40,028
Are you just going to do nothing?

477
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:42,906
Damn it.

478
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:45,909
What's that?

479
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:49,913
They're hiding in there.

480
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:00,257
Jinman wouldn't have called me here

481
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,885
if they could be stopped this easily.

482
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:10,726
From here on, you're on your own.

483
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:13,103
Don't die.

484
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:44,092
What do you want me to do?

485
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:52,392
MURTHEHELP
HANDOVER GUIDE

486
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:03,445
Jian, I'm sure you're confused.

487
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:05,864
But there's no time,

488
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:07,574
so I'll give you a chance to choose.

489
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:09,701
One,

490
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:12,371
if you want to run away
from this situation,

491
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,248
go to page 87.

492
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:18,877
Use the back door of murthehelp
that leads to an escape route to run away.

493
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:20,337
At the end of the route

494
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:24,049
are your new identity,
enough money for your new life,

495
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:29,638
and the phone number of the person
who will help you completely start over.

496
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:34,601
You'll have a new identity.

497
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:38,897
You'll be able to forget everything
about this life and start over.

498
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:41,316
Two,

499
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,570
if you want to join the people
who are fighting for you

500
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:47,948
or those who will fight alongside you

501
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:52,494
to overcome these difficulties
and protect this place,

502
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:55,706
turn the page
and read this guide carefully.

503
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:59,126
I'm sorry I let you fall
into this whirlwind,

504
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:04,089
but the choice is yours, Jian.

505
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:06,174
Damn it...

506
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:24,902
Hey, it's gas! Gas!

507
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:27,070
- It's gas! Gas!
- Gas!

508
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:37,915
This is suicide.

509
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:15,911
Now!

510
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:26,421
Guys, stay alert.

511
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:51,048
Minhye! Over here!

512
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:56,154
Oh, fuck.

513
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:01,952
What the hell?

514
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:04,246
What was that?

515
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:05,831
What exploded?

516
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,029
Are you okay?

517
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:40,115
Do you have more clothes?

518
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:51,918
Minhye!

519
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:54,087
-Minhye!
-So you're Jeong Jian.

520
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:57,048
Let me go!

521
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:59,259
Let go!

522
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:00,343
Hey!

523
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:05,974
What now?

524
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:30,040
You really do take after your uncle.

525
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:45,722
Damn it. Look what you did
to my handsome face.

526
00:53:47,515 --> 00:53:49,309
Kuma, what happened?

527
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:52,938
Did you get Jeong Jian and Minhye?

528
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:54,648
Yes, I got them, but...

529
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:58,068
Fuck, I'm the only one who survived.

530
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:01,613
Hey,
you can't kill Jeong Jian yet.

531
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:04,616
Okay, I won't kill her.

532
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:08,536
I'll just cut off half of her face.

533
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,163
She needs to be recognizable.

534
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,121
Master?

535
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:19,274
There's no time.

536
00:55:21,943 --> 00:55:22,944
Let's get ready.

537
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:25,363
Bale's coming.

538
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,241
"Bale"?

539
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:32,329
The one who killed your parents.

540
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,755
A SHOP FOR KILLERS

541
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:47,761
What was that?

542
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:50,347
A slingshot?

543
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:02,567
It looks like

544
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:05,737
you two should handle it.
