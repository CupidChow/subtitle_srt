1
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,430
Boss.

2
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:26,276
That belongs to Jeong Jinman.
Don't touch it.

3
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,154
What a pretty package.

4
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:30,697
Do you have a death wish?

5
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:33,783
Lao rice tastes good.

6
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:37,328
What are you talking about?
Japanese rice is the best.

7
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:38,830
Lao rice.

8
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:41,541
Boss.

9
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,305
Let's go.

10
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:27,879
TAKE CARE OF HER FOR A LITTLE WHILE

11
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:37,180
A SHOP FOR KILLERS

12
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,352
EPISODE 7
TRAP

13
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:46,773


14
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,817
Excuse me,
could the taller son

15
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:52,695
please stand closer to the family?

16
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:53,988
- Get in here.
Yes.

17
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,990
- Jinman, smile.
Good.

18
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,118
Why do I have to smile?

19
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,581
All right.

20
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:05,625
Here we go.

21
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,336
One, two!

22
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:30,483
Yes.

23
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,738
Be good

24
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,783
to your brother and sister-in-law.

25
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:41,870
And Jian.

26
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:45,248
Check on her when you can.

27
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,255
Worry about yourself, Mom.

28
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:56,885
Don't worry about me.

29
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,305
I lived a life without shame,

30
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,392
a good life.

31
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:13,526
And you've grown into a fine man.

32
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:26,414
I'm sorry, Mom.

33
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,709
Why would you be sorry?

34
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:39,719
Mmm.

35
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:44,224
Oh, it's time
for your brother to get here.

36
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,351
You can go now.

37
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,603
It's okay.

38
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:50,813
I'll stay a little longer.

39
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,608
No.

40
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,694
While you're here,

41
00:03:57,862 --> 00:04:01,699
spend more time with Jian.

42
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:03,743
Okay?

43
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:08,331
Okay. I will, Mom.

44
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,715
I'll come again.

45
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,240
BROTHER HARDWARE STORE

46
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,150
Seriously?

47
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,861
You're making a mess again!

48
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,488
Clean up!

49
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,298
Forget it. I'll just do it.

50
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,387
What's this supposed to be?

51
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,712
What is it?

52
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:04,799
Wow...

53
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:36,289
You're an arms dealer.
How could your security be this sloppy?

54
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:12,617
I missed...
I missed you.

55
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,739
Has his body been found?

56
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,786
The best in Southeast Asia
conducted the search.

57
00:08:56,869 --> 00:09:02,124
They said no one could've survived
that scene. He's dead.

58
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:08,881
No matter how invincible he was,

59
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,800
he died there!

60
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:18,558
What will you do now?

61
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,894
I don't know. I haven't thought about it.

62
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,938
Come work for me!

63
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,901
Come on. I'll hire you!

64
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:38,536
I'll even make an online shopping mall
and expand the business!

65
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:42,373
I'm going to make so much money!

66
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,502
You?

67
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,380
You handwrite ledgers
because you can't use a computer.

68
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,090
What online shopping mall?

69
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:59,181
My little brother will do it,
not me. He's a computer genius!

70
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,393
There's nothing he can't do
on a computer.

71
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:19,827
She assembled this gun earlier.

72
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,167
And I never taught her.

73
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,293
Is that you, Jinman?

74
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:24,308
Now, we'll split up
like this and put pressure on him.

75
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,602
If things go awry,

76
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,689
we'll go with plan B,
and Juncheol will finish it off.

77
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,986
That's the scenario I came up with.

78
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,615
There's no way Jeong Jinman won't show up.

79
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,660
One shot, two kills. Am I right?

80
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,253
What? Are you uncomfortable
about something?

81
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,924
Why do you look like
somebody just shot your dog?

82
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,468
It's just...

83
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,346
Do we have to touch his family?

84
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,683
I mean, his niece is only seven.

85
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,435
Anyone who wants to leave can go.

86
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,154
Hey, Juncheol.

87
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,406
Is Jeong Jinman's family
the only family here?

88
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:25,369
What?

89
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:34,170
We're all here
watching each other's backs.

90
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,923
Aren't we family too?

91
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,306
Then, what about Seonghwan?

92
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,808
Wasn't he part of the family?

93
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,518
What?

94
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,354
Our youngest who went to hell
during the last mission.

95
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,858
You said we were family.
Did you forget his name already?

96
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,445
Why would you bring up
the late Seonghwan now?

97
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,199
I think you know why.

98
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,456
Even family members

99
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,250
can show favoritism.

100
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,253
I was an orphan.

101
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,964
I have no parents or children,

102
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,967
so I consider everyone here my family.

103
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,763
You would know.
You have two kids of your own.

104
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:31,393
Right. Isn't your eldest
entering elementary school this year?

105
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,772
Time sure goes by fast.

106
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:38,108
His first birthday
feels like just yesterday.

107
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,277
Back then,

108
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:43,656
he should've picked money.
But he takes after his dad and--

109
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:47,034
Lee Seongjo, you bastard.
What the fuck are you trying to say?

110
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:43,841
What about the rice cakes?
They're not here yet.

111
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:49,013
Jeong Jian.

112
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,016
You're making things harder for me.

113
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,186
I want to go home.

114
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,230
Are you
out of your freaking mind?

115
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,736
Mom passed away so suddenly.

116
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,698
There's something strange about it.

117
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,201
I think

118
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,370
we should do an autopsy.

119
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,206
Do you really

120
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,043
want to open her up?

121
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,587
What?

122
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:25,382
Do you want to play
a loving son or something now?

123
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,514
It's not like that.

124
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,100
If you're that sure, fine.

125
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,853
Okay. I'm sorry.

126
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,275
Do you want the whole neighborhood
to know you two don't get along?

127
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,693
Why are you yelling?

128
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,613
There's no time for this.
We have a lot to do.

129
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,076
Jeong Jian!

130
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,377
Jeong Jinman.

131
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,295
Why are we going home?

132
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:09,051
Well, the food isn't ready yet.

133
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,095
They said to come back later.

134
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,723
I think it's going to be boring.

135
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:40,082
Damn, I'm not used to
wearing these clothes.

136
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,251
I look good though.

137
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,174
Yes.

138
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:09,486
The juniper casket
is the most expensive on the market.

139
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,531
It's considered the best for burial.

140
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,077
I see.

141
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,080
I will think it over.

142
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,332
Yes, sir.

143
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,585
Thank you so much.

144
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,469
We still have a lot to do.

145
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:35,679
Hold it together.

146
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,028
Please attain enlightenment.

147
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,584
I'm sorry, but who are you?

148
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,503
You don't remember me?

149
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:12,299
I'm an old friend of Jinman's.

150
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,801
Oh, I see.

151
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:16,345
But I don't see Jinman.

152
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,517
Jinman asked me for a favor,

153
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,894
so I brought some wreaths.

154
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,563
But I have some issues moving them.

155
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:29,566
Will you two help me?

156
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,658
But why would the wreaths be here?

157
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,786
Tell me about it.

158
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:46,250
The workers made a mistake
and delivered them here.

159
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:51,755
Yes.

160
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,841
What?

161
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:56,927
<i>Jeong Jinman</i>
<i>left the hospital with his niece.</i>

162
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:58,512
<i>What shall I do?</i>

163
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,849
Damn it.

164
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,102
No use crying over spilled milk.

165
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,355
Excuse me?

166
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,774
What are you saying?

167
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,648
<i>A lot of things don't make sense.</i>

168
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,276
<i>Can you check the security footage</i>
<i>at the hospital?</i>

169
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:07,915
I got some food for you.

170
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:14,296
No matter what you do,

171
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:19,843
you'll be more at ease on a full stomach.

172
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,660
Shit.

173
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:57,881
Now, now.

174
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,926
The scenario that we came up with

175
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,011
roughly goes like this.

176
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,265
It's very unfortunate,

177
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,393
but you had an affair,

178
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,731
and your husband lost it.

179
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:18,777
So he kills you...

180
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,155
and then commits suicide.

181
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,331
Honey...

182
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,505
To Jian...

183
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:53,812
Honey!

184
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,075
We have no bad feelings towards you.

185
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,163
But farewell...

186
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,336
and attain enlightenment.

187
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:13,058
Why aren't you answering it?
Isn't it Mom?

188
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:17,104
Who is it?

189
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,272
<i>Sir, this is Juncheol.</i>

190
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,025
How did you get this number?

191
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,693
<i>That's not important right now.</i>

192
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:25,904
<i>Bale is still alive.</i>

193
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,531
<i>I can't talk for long.</i>

194
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:31,076
<i>He's on his way to your mom's funeral</i>
<i>with Lee Seongjo.</i>

195
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:54,558
HONDA, BALE'S ALIVE.
HE'S AFTER MY FAMILY. PROTECT JIAN.

196
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:06,111
You promised to eat pork belly
with me tonight!

197
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:07,446
Where are you going?

198
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:11,199
Something suddenly came up.
I'm sorry.

199
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,995
I'll come back before dinner. I promise!

200
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:20,542
Darn it.

201
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:36,933
Jeong Jinman!

202
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,937
Will you be right back?

203
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:52,115
Yes, I'll be right back.

204
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:14,137
Please, answer your phone! Come on!

205
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:35,575
Solve the riddle.

206
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,786
What is a horse's favorite sport?

207
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:48,338
What is a horse's favorite sport...

208
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:10,610
Are you really my uncle's friend?

209
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,877
STABLE TENNIS

210
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:16,676
HAENGUN MANSION

211
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,094
Is this the place?

212
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:21,264
The bastard didn't even give us a call.

213
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,769
Go bring the kid.

214
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:27,020
I'll stay here.

215
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:28,647
Yes, sir.

216
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,694
What a long day.

217
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,823
CAN YOU WAIT IN YOUR ROOM FOR A MINUTE?

218
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:39,801
Why the unnecessary gunfight?

219
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,303
That's just more shit to clean up.

220
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:57,902
Fuck, my teeth.

221
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:12,667
LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU MEET JIAN

222
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,214
What the hell?

223
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:19,883
Over here!

224
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,722
I'm so sorry,

225
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:27,891
but my phone died.

226
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:29,976
Can I borrow your phone?

227
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:42,739
Who the hell is this bastard?

228
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,866
So persistent.

229
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:51,122
This is for my teeth.

230
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:54,501
Why won't it come off?

231
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,712
Attain enlightenment, you bastard!

232
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,050
LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU MEET JIAN

233
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,343
Where's the kid?

234
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:10,266
Shit.

235
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:39,671
Fuck!

236
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,034
It's bulletproof.

237
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:19,479
Bale's alive?

238
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,316
Sir.

239
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:24,484
I'm sorry.

240
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:26,027
I had no choice.

241
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:27,946
What about my brother?

242
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:48,841
What the hell?

243
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,054
Wow.

244
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:57,600
You'll get seriously hurt
if you fall from there, kid.

245
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:01,604
So stop that and come up to me. Come on!

246
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,106
No!

247
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:13,491
Goodness. The apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

248
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,671
Oh, my goodness!

249
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,802
I think we're in a bit of a jam.

250
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:06,794
This is incredible.

251
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:11,090
Nothing's impossible in this country.

252
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,095
I didn't bring you here
to sightsee.

253
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,225
The mute
that was helping Jeong Jinman.

254
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:23,895
Seongjo took him out.

255
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:26,773
Just shut your mouth

256
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:31,736
and find the witness
that Jinman smuggled out of Laos.

257
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,030
That's our top priority.

258
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:36,699
You're so uptight.

259
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:45,541
But what's this smell?

260
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:24,765
Don't worry about the hospital bills.

261
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:29,353
If it can't be done in Thailand,
get treated in Korea.

262
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:33,149
You know I have money. I'm rich!

263
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,031
Bye.

264
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:21,572
Jinman?

265
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:24,992
Jinman?

266
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:05,449
I don't want to get involved in this.
I resigned from Babylon.

267
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,743
I don't want anything to do with them.

268
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:11,831
Jeong Jinman. Now that you're up, leave.

269
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,048
I need a gun, Pasin.

270
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:26,304
I only need one.

271
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:28,764
If you help me,

272
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:30,808
I'll leave right away.

273
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:35,896
Why did you try to kill Bale?

274
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:37,857
Why did you do it?

275
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:47,450
I really don't get it.

276
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:51,203
Jeong Jinman always obeys the company.

277
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:54,623
Why did you cause so much trouble?

278
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,668
I wanted to set things right.

279
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:03,924
If I had testified properly in court,

280
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,679
Bale would be in jail right now.

281
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:10,806
Then...

282
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:14,310
the women in that room

283
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,981
<i>wouldn't have died like that.</i>

284
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,114
I wanted to set things right.

285
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:36,332
But...

286
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:41,754
I think I made another mistake.

287
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,226
It holds 13 rounds.

288
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:00,439
Thanks, Pasin.

289
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:03,984
What will you do with that?

290
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:20,376
Be careful, Jinman.

291
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:27,341
Everything burned down.

292
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,885
And our team members are all dead.

293
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:32,513
And the girl?

294
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:34,974
She disappeared.

295
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:39,311
I think there was someone else
in the store...

296
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:51,282
That's enough, Bale.

297
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:08,090
If you secretly conspired like this,

298
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:11,051
did you think I wouldn't know?

299
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,982
Can you stop here?

300
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:28,777
Even if I stop,

301
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,074
Jeong Jinman won't stop now.

302
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:38,662
The company will take care of the rest,
so you stay out of it.

303
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,791
Don't cause problems.
Tend to your wounds quietly.

304
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:48,672
You're going to let

305
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:51,133
Jeong Jinman go like this?

306
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,135
Who said that?

307
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:56,639
He's a traitor that lied to all of us.

308
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:59,558
On top of that, he killed Juncheol
and seven of our men.

309
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,727
We will take out Jeong Jinman.

310
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:06,315
And the company will make
an example of him.

311
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:13,989
What's your plan?

312
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:35,010
Enter the building.

313
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:42,101
NO UNAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL

314
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:58,367
JEONG JIAN

315
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:02,473
I think I found her.

316
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,643
<i>I'll take care of her and bring her out.</i>
<i>Stand by.</i>

317
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:27,623
<i>Bale,</i>
<i>leave it to the general this time.</i>

318
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:30,334
<i>Just take it easy on the sidelines, okay?</i>

319
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:33,671
I should be the one

320
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,215
to end Jeong Jinman.

321
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:37,966
Don't you think so?

322
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,552
<i>I know how you feel, but just this time...</i>

323
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:13,043
What are you doing here?
I told you to stand by.

324
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,340
You traitor!

325
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:07,616
<i>Jian, let's go home now.</i>

326
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:30,824
Grandpa!

327
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:33,076
- My sweet boy!
- Salute!

328
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,578
Salute!

329
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:39,249
- Happy birthday, Grandpa!
- Thank you so much, my boy.

330
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,960
- Dad, why are you so late?
- Sorry, something came up at work.

331
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:43,128
- Grandpa!
- Yes?

332
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:44,588
- Take a look at this.
- Okay.

333
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:46,840
The man made this for me.

334
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:49,134
Shall we go in?

335
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:50,969
Let's go.

336
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:52,095
Let's go.

337
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:55,432
Mister, can you make a car too?

338
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:58,226
Jungwoo, put away your toys,
and wash your hands.

339
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,562
He gets so excited
when we have guests.

340
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:07,611
Stop bothering him. Come on.

341
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:11,698
Is it done yet?

342
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,909
Yes, Mother. Can you taste this?

343
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,830
It's perfect.
Simmer it a little longer.

344
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:22,250
Do you want to try this?

345
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:27,464
You should've told us
we were going to have a guest over.

346
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:28,674
Sorry.

347
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:30,133
I forgot I invited him.

348
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:33,095
- Did you all say hello?
- Yes.

349
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:35,055
Dinner's ready. Come and sit.

350
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:36,431
Thank you so much, ma'am.

351
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:38,392
It's not much, though.

352
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:40,185
It's more than I could hope for.

353
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:42,813
Let's go eat.

354
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,449
What are you doing?

355
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:59,287
There are five rounds left in the mag.

356
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:01,790
Your grandson,

357
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:04,376
son, daughter-in-law, and wife...

358
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:08,505
I'll have one left
after I kill those four.

359
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:13,760
I was in the house for an hour
before you got here,

360
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:15,804
but I didn't do it.

361
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:21,643
What do you want?

362
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:28,358
I know you're a calculative man,

363
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:31,028
so I'll put it simply.

364
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:36,950
My mother,

365
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:43,248
brother, sister-in-law,

366
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,669
and my comrade and friend.

367
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:50,964
I lost four people

368
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:52,632
of mine.

369
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:56,762
Don't you think

370
00:50:57,262 --> 00:51:00,182
that's enough punishment for what I did?

371
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:04,061
If you stop here,

372
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:07,272
I'll bury everything that's happened

373
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:10,400
and take it to my grave.

374
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:20,327
Please, General.

375
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:32,964
It's me.

376
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:35,634
<i>Jinman says he'll stop here.</i>

377
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:38,929
<i>Do you think you can?</i>

378
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:08,333
Do you think Babylon will stop?

379
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:16,007
Babylon might back down,

380
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:19,803
but Bale won't.

381
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:26,434
Are you going to make the first move?

382
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:32,232
I could,

383
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:34,734
but not right now.

384
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:37,404
I need a long-term plan.

385
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:57,424
You'll make a shopping mall down there?

386
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:03,763
You're a crazy bastard, Jinman.

387
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:11,479
You do the digging.

388
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:13,398
Okay.

389
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:40,508
Let's go, Brother.

390
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:43,470
You're going to live with me now.

391
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:49,476
- Great job, boss. See you tomorrow.
- Yes, see you tomorrow.

392
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:55,315
You shouldn't walk alone late at night.

393
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:56,858
Want to have a drink with us?

394
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:20,715
Who are you?

395
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:22,259
What are you trying to do?

396
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:27,138
Oh, you're quite good.

397
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:36,481
Is this Honda's?

398
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:52,080
Get out.

399
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:13,179
A gun? Where did you get that?

400
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,432
Do you want to try it?

401
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:35,201
Listen up, Jian.

402
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:40,665
A SHOP FOR KILLERS
