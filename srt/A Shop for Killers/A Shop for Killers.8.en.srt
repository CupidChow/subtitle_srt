1
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:12,262
Then, what? Are we supposed to wait
until sunrise?

2
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:17,017
Tell that unit to shoot during the night.

3
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,686
Don't worry. We'll move soon.

4
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,025
You said you'd finish this alone.

5
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:29,320
I guess you're not
as good as you used to be.

6
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:43,001
To be honest, it's embarrassing
that I had to bring you guys into this,

7
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:47,172
but piercing through that
is harder than you think.

8
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,551
It's like a fortress.

9
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:55,597
The boys who came before you are all dead.

10
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:01,478
So don't let your guard down,
and do your best.

11
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,613
<i>Announcement to all residents.</i>

<i>During the firearm training...</i>

20
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:35,845
A SHOP FOR KILLERS

21
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:41,101
EPISODE 8
LISTEN UP, JIAN

22
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:42,477


23
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:50,902


24
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:57,784
What is all this?

25
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,643
It smells like gunpowder.

26
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,237
Wow.

27
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,617
Jeong... Jeong Jinman is shameless.

28
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:24,746
I've been living here for 14 years,

29
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,665
but he didn't tell me about this!

30
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:28,833
Wow.

31
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,646
Fuck.

32
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:54,484
Why do these assholes keep hanging me up?

33
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,569
Motherfuckers.

34
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,662
For fuck's sake! Damn it.

35
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:03,720
Minhye.

36
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:07,515
Don't die.

37
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,645
Death isn't something scary.

38
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:15,898
<i>Death isn't something scary.</i>

39
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,491
You liked my uncle, didn't you?

40
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,582
Where is it?

41
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:40,089
It's not the time for that.

42
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,926
Lee Seongjo will be back.

43
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:46,679
Lee Seongjo?

44
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,310
We have to get into the shopping mall.

45
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:55,897
No, we can't.

46
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,776
We can't go in right now.

47
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:20,731
Those ignorant bastards.
All they do is shoot their weapons.

48
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,027
How dare they take me for a sucker?

49
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,574
I'll show you what I can do, bastards.

50
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:33,077
We can't go inside
the shopping mall right now!

51
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,037
How many times do I have to tell you?

52
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,999
Why the hell are you yelling?

53
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,168
Why can't we go in?

54
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,128
I dug that underground tunnel.

55
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:43,963
We have to get inside to be safe.

56
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:48,468
No, the boss set booby traps

57
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,011
in there!

58
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:52,930
Boom!

59
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,600
- What?
- Traps even you don't know about, Pasin!

60
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,396
The shopping mall

61
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,941
is designed to be operated by a manager
at all times.

62
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:07,904
So I was always there
when the boss was absent.

63
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,865
And the boss was there
when I was away at night sometimes.

64
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,494
In the last 14 years,
it's never been left unattended.

65
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:17,246
And you're another registered manager,

66
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,331
Jeong Jian.

67
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:21,000
That's why I told you not to leave!
Damn it.

68
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,877
What if a manager leaves?

69
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,630
Restart protocol.

70
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,175
No manager means an emergency situation.

71
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:33,179
All the operations in the shopping mall
get shut down.

72
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,643
So how long does it take
for it to restart?

73
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:41,020
Precisely 24 hours.

74
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,944
We have about 20 hours
and 30 minutes left.

75
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,614
Then, what do we do now?

76
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:53,991
Huh?

77
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,159
What's wrong?

78
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:59,830
Someone accessed the shopping mall server.

79
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:03,543
Do you think I only have
the video of Jeong Jinman's death?

80
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,586
Let's see who wins.

81
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,096
I want to take a shower. Fuck.

82
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:19,850
Damn it.

83
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,287
Master.

84
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:44,625
Are you a killer too, then?

85
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:55,011
Jian, I'm glad you're alive.

86
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,652
Promise me

87
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,072
you'll tell me everything later.

88
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:25,625
This is the first thing
your brother taught me.

89
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:32,840
No matter what you do,
you'll be more at ease on a full stomach.

90
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,134
Eat this first.

91
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,575
You brothers are so different.

92
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,912
Honda was tech illiterate.

93
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,877
I think it's him, Jian!

94
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,588
What did you do to him?

95
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,341
What are you talking about? I tied him up.

96
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,219
Is there someone in the shopping mall?

97
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:20,680
I should've taken him out earlier.

98
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,015
What's wrong? What's going on?

99
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:26,727
I told you not to trust Bae Jeongmin!

100
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,229
Who's Bae Jeongmin?

101
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,690
He said he was friends with Jian.

102
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,149
What were you doing?

103
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,568
How do I know?
I've never seen him either.

104
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,696
Can't you do something?

105
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,423
Is it broken?

106
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:58,551
It might do something strange.
Just shoot it.

107
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,436
Jian!

108
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,146
Hide in the bathroom passageway!

109
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:05,242
Hey!

110
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,378
What the hell?

111
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,726
This is so embarrassing.

112
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,531
It's Minhye's turn to suffer.

113
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,720
Brothers.

114
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,557
You're coming to hell with me.

115
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,742
We have no plans of going today.

116
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:44,026
I knew it. Jeong sure was thorough.

117
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,959
Attain enlightenment, Kuma.

118
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,089
Jian.

119
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,675
When you were young,

120
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,760
you were in a similar situation with me.

121
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,096
Do you remember?

122
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,014
Well?

123
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,100
What do you call something like this?

124
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,560
What was it?

125
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,647
Déjà vu?

126
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:29,571
You weren't even ten back then,
but you managed to escape out the window.

127
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:33,492
I was very impressed, you know.

128
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:40,666
But there are no windows
to jump out of here.

129
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:43,836
So...

130
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:47,131
where could Jian be hiding?

131
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,220
Goodness!

132
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,346
A bayonet?

133
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,560
You haven't seen me in a while.

134
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:02,104
You should ask me how I'm doing first.

135
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:03,647
Shouldn't you?

136
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,442
Right?

137
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,111
I won't kill you right now.

138
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,030
I still have a use for you.

139
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:15,743
What the hell was that?

140
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,248
That hurt, asshole!

141
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,794
Goodness, Jian.

142
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,508
Jeong Jian!

143
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,969
Hurry up and run!

144
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,429
You have to live!

145
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,286
Damn it.

146
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,871
What's this?

147
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:02,831
Are you on death row?

148
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:12,966
Fuck.

149
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:20,766
Jian, run!

150
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:23,519
Minhye!

151
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,322
No!

152
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,617
Get out of here!

153
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,670
Attain enlightenment.

154
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,590
I'll see you later.

155
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,620
<i>Listen up, Jian.</i>

156
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,538
<i>Listen up, Jian.</i>

157
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,081
<i>Listen up, Jian.</i>

158
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:10,918
<i>Listen up, Jian.</i>

159
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,212
<i>Listen up, Jian.</i>

160
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:15,339
<i>Listen up, Jian.</i>

161
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,235
<i>Listen up, Jian.</i>

162
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,962
Damn it. I told them to be careful.

163
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,851
Minhye, that bitch. She used poison.

164
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:11,895
Right.

165
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,314
No matter how seasoned a wolf is,

166
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,441
it can't outsmart a fox.

167
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,821
Look at that.

168
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,333
What's this?

169
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,131
Hello, baby.

170
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:51,560
Look at you,

171
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,103
all grown up.

172
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,896
Don't move, you son of a bitch.

173
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,449
I bet you're curious
about a lot of things.

174
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,535
You have no idea what's going on, do you?

175
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,621
That's why you're standing there
and not shooting.

176
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:12,706
Am I right?

177
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,045
Was it you?

178
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:21,173
The one who killed my parents.

179
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,926
Is that what you want to know?

180
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,513
Well, that's...

181
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:31,600
It's quite complicated.

182
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,602
You know.

183
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:37,314
Do you think your uncle was a good person?

184
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:39,232
Shut up and just answer me!

185
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,251
You fuckers.

186
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:05,425
You took me for a sucker, didn't you?

187
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:30,075
You bitches!

188
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,833
Babylon, you sons of bitches!

189
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,920
I'm the one that killed Jeong Jinman.

190
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,923
But you're trying
to take credit for it. Fuck.

191
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:46,591
Do you take me for a fool?

192
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:49,803
Who the hell is that whacko?

193
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:52,597
What did you do? You fucking losers!

194
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:58,937
Jeong Jian.

195
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:04,192
You were just a mute bitch as a child.

196
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:09,614
But you look down on me
just because you learned how to fight.

197
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,408
You fucking bitch!

198
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:14,828
Where are you hiding?

199
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,290
Come out!

200
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,170
What's wrong with this?

201
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,090
Fuck!

202
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:29,593
What's wrong? It's not firing?

203
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,395
Using bullets on someone like you
would be a waste.

204
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:42,481
It wasn't me.

205
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,525
It really wasn't me.

206
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,618
Damn it.

207
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,464
What? Is this it?

208
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,760
Wait, was he...

209
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,681
Goodness. We must've been
on the same side.

210
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,976
I wouldn't have killed him
if he'd kept his mouth shut.

211
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,229
Damn.

212
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,524
You will attain enlightenment.

213
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:27,943
Shit.

214
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:34,449
All right.

215
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,708
If you wanted me to take over,

216
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,252
you could've left me the key!

217
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:46,419
Damn it!

218
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,964
Jian!

219
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,715
I'm inside too.

220
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:26,001
Oh, my... He made this here?

221
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:29,212
Jeong really was incredible.

222
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,465
But why is it so hot in here?

223
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,636
Goodness.

224
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:46,396
Wow, I wonder how many years
it took him to build all of this.

225
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,400
I bet it cost him a fortune.

226
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,195
Wow.

227
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,784
Baby, hang in there for a bit.

228
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,371
How much is all of this?

229
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,375
Wow.

230
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,962
I can see why Babylon got involved.

231
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:36,279
You're good at dodging, aren't you?

232
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:43,870
You're so good that I want to recruit you
and put you on my team.

233
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:56,299
Jian, be careful.

234
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,719
This is very expensive.

235
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:10,772
By the way, I'm so sorry

236
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:13,608
about your parents.

237
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,819
They seemed like nice people.

238
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:23,368
But there's something you should know.

239
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:26,621
Your uncle went around
killing a lot of people too.

240
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:29,040
We were all in one team.

241
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,547
All those people he killed
must've had families too, right?

242
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,006
Just like your mom and dad.

243
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:40,135
Well, I grew up in an orphanage,

244
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:43,054
so I wouldn't know much about it.

245
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:54,691
So,

246
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:58,361
my team was like family to me,

247
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:03,199
but your uncle ruined everything.

248
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:11,040
So don't resent us.

249
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:14,335
Blame your uncle, okay?

250
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,254
Let's be honest. It's messed up.

251
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,757
He died

252
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,967
and left the suffering to his young niece

253
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,803
who should be spending her time
studying and dating.

254
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,622
My, my. I know that sound.

255
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:53,374
It sounds like you're out of bullets.

256
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,001
Right?

257
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,391
My goodness.

258
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:18,149
This place is packed with weapons.

259
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:22,237
But there's nothing
for our niece to use, is there?

260
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:25,925
<i>If you want to run away</i>
<i>from this situation,</i>

261
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:29,637
<i>use the back door that leads</i>
<i>to an escape route to run away.</i>

262
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:33,182
<i>You'll have a new identity.</i>

263
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:38,855
<i>You'll be able to forget everything</i>
<i>about this life and start over.</i>

264
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,775
Fuck...

265
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:51,135
Fuck.

266
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,180
I thought I was going to die.

267
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,433
Jian.

268
00:32:58,518 --> 00:32:59,852
Where are you?

269
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:08,987
Damn, I'm too old to be doing
something like this with a kid.

270
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,638
<i>When are we going to hell again?</i>

271
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,515
-<i>Not today!</i>
-<i>Not today!</i>

272
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:43,354
When I used to work
with your uncle,

273
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:47,650
we came up with a slogan.

274
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:53,948
"Let's not go to hell today."

275
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:58,494
He always said it,
but he was the first to go.

276
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,838
I'm no different from Jeong.

277
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,507
We're all destined

278
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:14,427
to go to hell.

279
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:20,308
But you have a choice, Jian.

280
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:24,604
Your uncle's already in hell anyway,

281
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:27,315
and this place, well...

282
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:29,984
Babylon will take care of it soon.

283
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:33,196
But you...

284
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:38,826
You can leave this place quietly
and live a normal life, right?

285
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:45,208
However,

286
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:50,838
if you try to get revenge

287
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:54,383
and try to fight me,

288
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:56,427
then, you'll be destined

289
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:58,471
to the same fate

290
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,057
as your uncle and me.

291
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:03,726
Destined to go to hell.

292
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:06,604
Do you get it?

293
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:10,441
Once you taste blood,

294
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:15,780
you'll end up rotting in hell
for all eternity.

295
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:19,158
You'll never attain enlightenment.

296
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,609
Wow, Jeong taught her well.

297
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:55,778
Hmm?

298
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,127
Hey, gold tooth.

299
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:32,899
Jian.

300
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:36,652
Are you sure you can shoot that?

301
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,947
That gun isn't for just anyone.

302
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:45,244
You've never shot anyone, have you?

303
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:50,625
No.

304
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:52,627
I haven't.

305
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:02,595
Oh, shit!

306
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:46,555
Do you really think

307
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:49,892
you can go to hell like that?

308
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,106
Attain enlightenment!

309
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:43,321
Minhye, wake up.

310
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:51,537
Minhye!

311
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:36,999
Jeong Jian?

312
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,590
My goodness.

313
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:46,759
Lee Seongjo...

314
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,435
Are you okay?

315
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,355
What about Master Pasin and Minhye?

316
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:01,857
They're alive!

317
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,633
Bae Jeongmin, that asshole.

318
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:29,385
He sure was good.

319
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,804
I can't believe he got through this.

320
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:41,147
What?

321
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,984
What's this?

322
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:54,493
What is that?

323
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,580
Killers who used to

324
00:40:57,663 --> 00:41:00,875
do business with the boss, maybe?

325
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,680
Shit! They already started!

326
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,600
I told you we had to hurry up!

327
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:20,394
Chungsik, how could you
be still so clueless?

328
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:23,314
You suffer damages
showing up early to a party like this.

329
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:26,275
Just show up at the appropriate time
and get the targets.

330
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:29,111
Watch how I do, and learn, got it?

331
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:30,863
Agreed.

332
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:32,948
- Let's go make some money!
- Let's go!

333
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:41,123
Hey, Choi Yeongik!

334
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:42,917
How have you been?

335
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:46,754
Who do we get first?

336
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:48,464
Are all the targets gathered?

337
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,133
Why would I tell you that?

338
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:52,676
Figure it out yourselves.

339
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:56,514
Yeongik, you'll get a bellyache
if you're too greedy.

340
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,350
It would hurt me more to see you take it.

341
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:01,894
Whatever. Anyway, I'll give up Minhye.

342
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:03,896
You take her if you have a death wish.

343
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:07,233
Hey, guys. Long time no see!

344
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:09,568
Don't you have work in the morning?

345
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:11,153
You guys are working so hard.

346
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:12,613
Leave them.

347
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:14,615
They're at that age.

348
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:29,296
It's Babylon.

349
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,965
It's Babylon!

350
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:33,634
They put all of us on the hit list.

351
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:36,470
They're all those
who used to do business with us.

352
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:38,097
So,

353
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:40,099
all those people...

354
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:42,518
"JEONG JIAN, AN CHANGHUI
SO MINHYE, PASIN KRADEK"

355
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:44,478
...are on their way to kill us?

356
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,148
Jeong Jian.

357
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,943
What are you going to do now?

358
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:54,154
What?

359
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:56,949
Did you just ask me?

360
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:58,534
Of course!

361
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:01,579
You're the owner now!

362
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:12,798
- Follow me.
- Why?

363
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:16,552
- Open it.
- Okay.

364
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:31,150
What are you doing?
What are you going to do with that?

365
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,904
Where's Jian?

366
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:39,241
They've sent more men.

367
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:42,620
It means she's still alive.

368
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:52,504
Don't worry.

369
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:55,215
They can't get into the shopping mall.

370
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:11,231
Shit.

371
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:15,152
This place is a mess.

372
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:17,988
Are you sure
Jeong Jinman's niece is in here?

373
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:21,575
Even if she isn't,
collecting the weapons alone is a win.

374
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,667
Where's the shopping mall?

375
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:45,516
Hello.

376
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:03,367
-<i>Testing.</i>

377
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:06,495
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

378
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:11,083
It's nice to meet you, shoppers.

379
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,336
<i>I'm the new owner of murthehelp,</i>

380
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,089
Jeong Jinman's niece, Jeong Jian.

381
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:25,305
<i>I want to start by offering a gift</i>
<i>to the shoppers who came all this way.</i>

382
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:36,275
Shit.

383
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:42,948
Lee Seongjo?

384
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,701
<i>That's right.</i>

385
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:49,621
It's Lee Seongjo
whom I killed not too long ago.

386
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:51,457
Lee Seongjo?

387
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:58,046
Six in the warehouse.

388
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:02,009
<i>Six in the living room.</i>

389
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:05,262
Six more in the garden.

390
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:07,431
There are a total of 18 Code Red shoppers.

391
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:11,518
I'd like to make you an offer.

392
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:15,147
<i>If you leave right now,</i>

393
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:18,317
nothing will happen to you.

394
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:22,488
As for the four-million-dollar bounty
Babylon offered,

395
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:26,617
I will divide it evenly and wire it
to each of you without tax deductions.

396
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:30,996
<i>As you did with my uncle, Jeong Jinman,</i>

397
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:39,254
you may do business with me.

398
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:41,757
<i>Your codes will be maintained.</i>

399
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,926
<i>Every once in a while,</i>

400
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:46,303
<i>I promise to give you discounts</i>

401
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:48,472
and a better price than Jeong Jinman did.

402
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:51,975
However,

403
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:59,900
if you don't give up
and keep trying to take this place,

404
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:05,781
all of you

405
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:08,325
will die here.

406
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:15,374
<i>I will count to three, and you can decide.</i>

407
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:17,125
One.

408
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:20,838
Two.

409
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:26,552
Three.

410
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:37,896
Won't it be inconvenient
without this place?

411
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:40,148
Plus, she'll pay us tax-free.

412
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:42,734
Only Babylon will benefit from this.

413
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:46,071
She's definitely Jeong Jinman's niece.

414
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:57,249
Goodbye.

415
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,426
Jeong Jian is good.

416
00:48:07,509 --> 00:48:09,094
Right, we all get a cut.

417
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:11,430
There's no income deduction.

418
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:12,514
It's not bad.

419
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:05,067
Never again.

420
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:09,029
Don't make me do something
like that again.

421
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:27,214
I should go out there.

422
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:57,137
Master?

423
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:00,682
Minhye?

424
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:00,904
Stop coming here, you sons of bitches!

425
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:18,672
Are you okay?

426
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:37,315
We're in charge of cleaning up.

427
00:54:43,571 --> 00:54:44,698
Code Yellow?

428
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:37,876
It's still dangerous, so you should
stay inside the shopping mall.

429
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:40,211
Sir. Something's coming this way.

430
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:43,757
You should stay here.

431
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,009
It's okay.

432
00:56:00,648 --> 00:56:02,025
Are they one of ours?

433
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:05,528
No, we can't confirm that.

434
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:31,388
Mister?

435
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:43,209
A SHOP FOR KILLERS
