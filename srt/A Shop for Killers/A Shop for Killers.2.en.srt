00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:40,665
A SHOP FOR KILLERS

EPISODE 2
JEONG JINMAN, JEONG JINMAN, JEONG JINMAN

3
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,884
-Are you
out of your freaking mind?

4
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,136


5
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,057
Mom passed away so suddenly.

6
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:00,894
There's something strange about it.

7
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:04,439
I think

8
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,232
we should do an autopsy.

9
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,276
An autopsy?

10
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,154
Jinman.

11
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:15,992
Mom had surgery
for biliary tract cancer twice.

12
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,411
She suffered for over five years.

13
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:22,082
The doctor even told us
to prepare for the worst.

14
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:25,835
She regained energy briefly
because her son she thought was dead

15
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:31,091
came back after eight years.
Her death wasn't sudden.

16
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,426
Are you sure?

17
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:35,970
What if I'm not?

18
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:38,389
What?

19
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:42,644
Do you want to play
a loving son or something now?

20
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:46,981
Do you want the whole neighborhood to know
you two don't get along?

21
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,608
Why are you yelling?

22
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:51,611
There's no time for this.
We have a lot to do.

23
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:58,618
Jeong Jian!

24
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:02,288
I told you to stay still!

25
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,207
Oh, no. What do we do?

26
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,585
Come here.

27
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:14,217
- Jinman.
- Yes?

28
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,138
We'll take care of the preparations here.
Why don't you go home with Jian?

29
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,558
Jian is of no help here.

30
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,212
Please attain enlightenment.

31
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,059
Your mother worried so much about her sons
when she was alive.

32
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,353
It must be so hard for you.

33
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,317
I'm sorry, but who are you?

34
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,485
You don't remember me?

35
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:19,699
I'm an old friend of Jinman's.

36
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:21,701
- Oh, I see.
- Yes.

37
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,079
But I don't see Jinman.

38
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,930
Then...

39
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:27,725
now that Grandma's dead,
we can't see her anymore?

40
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,107
No.

41
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:36,901
Not anymore.

42
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,157
Dying sucks.

43
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,370
You're right. It sucks.

44
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:51,291
But...

45
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,252
we all die eventually.

46
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,964
Death isn't something scary.

47
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,886
Do you see that lion?

48
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,098
That lion will die soon.

49
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,685
But take a look.

50
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,938
The lion who's facing death is quiet

51
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,399
while they're all loud.

52
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:21,779
Why do you think that is?

53
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,703
Only the weak bark.

54
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:32,290
The strong don't.

55
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,251
You must become strong.

56
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,674
To make your opponent bark.

57
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,680
I'm scared.

58
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,724
Don't be scared.

59
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:52,810
Whatever makes you scared,

60
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,064
keep your eyes open and face it.

61
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,824
Why aren't you answering it? Isn't it Mom?

62
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:13,664
Who is it?

63
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,668
How did you get this number?

64
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:42,151
Listen up, Jian.

65
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:46,197
I'm going to the funeral hall
to meet Mom and Dad.

66
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,366
You have to stay at home alone.

67
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,828
My friend will come
and ask you to open the door.

68
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,790
But don't just open the door for him.

69
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:57,792
Give him a riddle.

70
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,711
Open the door only if he solves it.

71
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,297
If he doesn't know the answer,

72
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:05,967
don't open the door.

73
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:07,760
Can you do that?

74
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,304
Yes, I can do it.

75
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,433
And I want to give him this riddle.

76
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,685
"What is a horse's favorite sport?"

77
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,564
"Stable tennis."

78
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,323
Jeong Jinman!

79
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,537
Will you be right back?

80
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,296
Yes, I'll be right back.

81
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:56,976
HAENGUN MANSION

82
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:18,998
Are you my uncle's friend?

83
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:04,544
I can't just open the door.
I'll give you a riddle.

84
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,588
I'll open the door if you solve it.

85
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,007
What is a horse's favorite sport?

86
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:16,013
Solve the riddle.

87
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,766
What is a horse's favorite sport?

88
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:28,276
What is a horse's favorite sport...

89
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,008
Are you really my uncle's friend?

90
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,176
STABLE TENNIS

91
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,771
I'M YOUR UNCLE'S FRIEND. SORRY I'M LATE.

92
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,485


93
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:06,248
CAN YOU WAIT IN YOUR ROOM FOR A MINUTE?

94
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,477
Fuck, my teeth.

95
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,741
Attain enlightenment, you bastard!

96
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:41,135
-Are you sure she's in here?
-I saw the door close.

97
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:59,236
My goodness. I'm so exhausted.

98
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,239
Good grief.

99
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,966
What the hell?

100
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:25,721
Wow.

101
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,224
Huh?

102
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,226
I can tell.

103
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,728
You're definitely Jeong Jinman's niece.

104
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:37,107
You'll get seriously hurt
if you fall from there, kid.

105
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,819
You might die or become crippled.

106
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,696
So stop that and come up to me.

107
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,449
Okay? Come on!

108
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:54,625
No!

109
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,890
Goodness. The apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

110
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,156
Oh, my goodness!

111
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,963
I think we're in a bit of a jam.

112
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:53,183
So she's the daughter of the couple

113
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,227
murdered at Boram Funeral Home?

114
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,062
That's right.

115
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,149
Her parents didn't return home

116
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,192
after what happened at the funeral,

117
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:06,071
so she left to go find them by herself
and got into an accident.

118
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,865
Goodness.

119
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,743
Then what happens to her now?

120
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,202
Well...

121
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,747
She has an uncle.

122
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,541
- Yes.
- But he's been missing for years.

123
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,711
And his social security number
was canceled last year.

124
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:36,513
JEONG JIAN

125
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,646
INSTRUCTIONS FOR MORGUE USE

126
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:11,108
RESTRICTED AREA
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

127
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,487
MORGUE

128
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,469
I think I found her.

129
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,723
I'll take care of her and bring her out.
Stand by.

130
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:26,975
Mommy?

131
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,284
What are you doing here?
I told you to stand by.

132
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:19,940
Close your eyes, Jian.

133
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,360
Let's go home now.

134
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:34,621
ONE MONTH LATER

135
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:58,914
Get out.

136
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,240
Listen up, Jian.

137
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:36,952
I'm not your parent.

138
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:38,745
And I can never be.

139
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:40,330
Which means

140
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,166
I can't do the things

141
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,752
your parents did for you.

142
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:42,809
<i>It appears to be aphasia</i>
<i>coupled with dissociative amnesia.</i>

143
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,437
<i>It doesn't seem to be a physical problem.</i>

144
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,023
<i>She lost both of her parents.</i>

145
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:51,943
<i>I think the resulting shock</i>
<i>and post-traumatic stress caused it.</i>

146
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:56,072
<i>Let's see what happens</i>
<i>with medication and counseling.</i>

147
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:07,727
There's no big problem with her studies,

148
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,189
but since Jian can't speak,

149
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:14,401
it's causing some difficulties.

150
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,282
She's stupid.
She still can't say anything.

151
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,493
Hey, can you really not speak?

152
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:25,829
-She's always like that.
-She's a mute.

153
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,082
-What's he doing?
-Wow.

154
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:31,501
-Does he like her?
- Jeongmin, what's your deal?

155
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:33,753
-Out of the blue?
-Are they fighting?

156
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,256
Are you okay?

157
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:44,472
Did you know?

158
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:45,807
-What?
-What is it?

159
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:46,891
That dummy's mom

160
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,018
was stabbed to death by her dad.

161
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,228
-Why?
-What?

162
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:52,105
-Why?
-She was having an affair.

163
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:57,861
Her dad jumped off the roof
of the funeral home and killed himself.

164
00:28:57,944 --> 00:29:00,655
-Really? Suicide?
-Ask your mom.

165
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,575
Everyone in Yecheong knows.

166
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:04,743
That's crazy!

167
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:10,039
-Hey, are you okay!
-Hey!

168
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,709
-Are you okay?
-Oh, no.

169
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:15,628
She can't seem to blend in
with the other kids.

170
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,672
I can see she's an outsider.

171
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,258
Dad!

172
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:21,384
Mom!

173
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:24,012
Why are you so late? I'm soaked!

174
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,765
Jiyun, did you have fun today?

175
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,351
Wait for me!

176
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:33,104
Hey! Wait up!

177
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,947
Hey, Shinae! Let's go together.

178
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:45,825
Mom!

179
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,243
YECHEONG ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

180
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,954
Hey! Wait up!

181
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:16,541
You're treating Jian for aphasia, right?

what you're trying to say.

191
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:55,807
However...

192
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,768
I think this problem

193
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:02,939
is something Jian must overcome
on her own.

194
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:13,866
It's the crazy mute's fault.

195
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:15,952
So unlucky.

196
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:19,872
Yeah.

197
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:21,541
Hey, shut it.

198
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:29,799
Let's go.

199
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:00,890
Jeong...

200
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:03,226
Jin...

201
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:04,393
man...

202
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:11,275
Jeong Jinman!

203
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:15,113
Jeong Jinman!

204
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:18,366
Jeong Jinman!

205
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,329
Jeong Jinman!

206
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,960
Jeong Jinman!

207
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:46,602
Why did you come so late?
You said you'd be right back!

208
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:50,022
Why did you come so late? Why?

209
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:57,655
I'm sorry I'm late.

210
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:00,783
Jeong Jian.

211
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:46,329
Come here.

212
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,247
Let's eat together.

213
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,493
This pork belly's good.

214
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:01,988
Your front door was open, so I came in.

215
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,460
If it's all right with you,

216
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:19,213
can I wait for him inside?

217
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:26,345
My uncle said he wasn't coming home today.

218
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,347
So you should just go back.

219
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,474
I'll tell my uncle

220
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,393
to call you later.

221
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:40,109
You're the niece

222
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:42,236
that attends
Gongju National University, right?

223
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:45,990
Your uncle bragged
about how pretty and smart you are.

224
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:57,001
I'm not smart or pretty.

225
00:38:57,752 --> 00:39:00,004
I don't attend
Gongju National University, either.

226
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:03,049
My uncle would never say that.

227
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,764
Do you really know my uncle?

228
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,810
I understand.

229
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:18,272
I'll call your uncle
and come back next time.

230
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:47,009
DON'T LET ANYONE ELSE KILL YOU

231
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,720
I'LL COME AND KILL YOU MYSELF, JIAN.

232
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,055
Jian.

233
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:52,390
Come and look at this.

234
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:56,519
I hacked into the operator's account
for murthehelp and had a look.

235
00:39:57,144 --> 00:40:00,481
This website is operated
for authorized members only.

236
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:02,441
Look.

237
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:08,989
Members can get codes
according to their grades.

238
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:12,118
The process is a little tricky,
but it says that only those

239
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:13,702
who pass this can get codes.

240
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:15,913
Codes?

241
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:18,624
"Only authorized members
with the operator's codes

242
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:20,501
can purchase items on murthehelp."

243
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:23,921
"Not all items are available for purchase
with provided codes."

244
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:25,840
"Each code has a different quality."

245
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:29,051
"You can only purchase
the qualified items for that code."

246
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,470
A different quality for each code?

247
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:33,013
Yes.

248
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:34,765
There are four codes.

249
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:38,060
<i>People who kill people are Code Red.</i>

250
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:41,397
<i>I think it's like contract killers</i>
<i>that we see in movies.</i>

251
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,942
<i>Guns, weapons, bombs, and poisons.</i>

252
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:47,987
It seems they can buy
items needed to kill people.

253
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,905
Spies are Code Purple.

254
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:52,575
<i>"A code for people</i>
<i>who buy and sell information."</i>

255
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:54,827
<i>"A variety of listening devices</i>
<i>or cameras."</i>

256
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:57,538
<i>"Simple weapons or goods that you can use</i>

257
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:00,082
to kill yourself
when your cover is blown."

258
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:01,750
It sounds so scary.

259
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:06,297
Do you want to try it?

260
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:09,800
Code Yellow is for the clean-up crew.

261
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:14,096
<i>"Drugs, detergents, and cleaning tools</i>
<i>needed for body disposal and clean-up."</i>

262
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:18,559
It also says that they provide various
administrative services to evade the law.

263
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:22,104
You said there are four codes.
What's the last one?

264
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,230
Code Green.

265
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:24,732
Green?

266
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:28,319
Yes, but unlike the other codes,
I don't think it has a category.

267
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:36,785
Code Green.

268
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:41,123
"Those who have received codes from
murthehelp may never attack Code Green."

269
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:44,001
"If someone disobeys this
and attacks Code Green,

270
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:50,424
everyone with a code must risk
their lives to protect Code Green."

271
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:53,093
So who's Code Green?

272
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,681
The operator of murthehelp.

273
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,017
Your uncle, Jeong Jinman.

274
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:02,478
And...

275
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,480
JEONG JINMAN, JEONG JIAN

276
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:07,399
Jeong Jian.

277
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,662
What on earth...

278
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,125
Am I supposed

279
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,628
to believe all this?

280
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,130
Jeongmin.

281
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:33,342
Does this make sense...

282
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:52,111
What is this?

283
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:56,198
What is happening?

284
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:09,837
What... the heck is that?

285
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:38,407
I'm not getting any signal.

286
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:40,659
Darn it!

287
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,163
Jeongmin.

288
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:45,497
Let's use the back door!

289
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:01,347
What's with the door?

290
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:03,223
Is it bulletproof?

291
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:19,907
What?

292
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:22,493
Why aren't they moving?

293
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:25,746
Are they out of bullets?

294
00:44:58,362 --> 00:44:59,530
What's that?

295
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:29,059
Jeongmin, this way!

296
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:43,115
Jeongmin!

297
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,456
Shut the door!

298
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,126
Jeongmin, duck!

299
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:38,689
A SHOP FOR KILLERS

300
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:39,898
Hello.

301
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:45,195
Oh, really?

302
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:47,072
You got married? Congrats!

303
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:50,701
-Oh, congratulations!
-Thanks.

304
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:52,995
But does your wife know you do this work?

305
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:54,496
No way. That would be bad.

306
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:57,833
By the way,
where were you from again? 707?

307
00:47:57,916 --> 00:47:59,084
No, the UDT/SEAL.

308
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:01,461
UDT? Really?

309
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:05,257
Mr. Kim, you're here!

310
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:06,758
Hello!

311
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:08,719
- Welcome!
- Hello!

312
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:09,928
You're here as well.

313
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:11,513
Yes, sir.

314
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:15,726
Is married life fun?

315
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:17,311
Not at all.

316
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:37,080
Sir, do we have to do that?

317
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:41,251
After today, it doesn't matter
if we have one or not anyway.

318
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:45,130
You do what's comfortable for you.

319
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,591
I don't need this code anymore.

320
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:50,886
Wow!
The veteran warriors have all gathered!

321
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:53,972
Victory!

322
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:55,474
- Victory!
- Victory!

323
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:59,227
You came, Mr. Kim.

324
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:01,271
Seongjo, has it been a year?

325
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:04,441
Thank you for changing your mind.

326
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:08,820
I bet we'll finish early today
if we follow Mr. Kim's lead.

327
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:11,490
Let's grab some <i>galbi</i> and <i>makgeolli</i> after!

328
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:12,991
-Sounds good!
-Sure!

329
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,453
What weapons did you bring?

330
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:18,830
Bring out your babies. Come on.

331
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:25,170
This is so worn out.

332
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:29,341
Wow, man!

333
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:31,343
Where did you get the rail?

334
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:33,804
Jinman installed it for me. I feel so bad.

335
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:35,639
I bought this from Jinman too.

336
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:37,349
Four mags will be enough, right?

337
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:39,351
By the way, what's up with your gun?

338
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:42,854
I've used every gun out there,
but this is light and comfortable.

339
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:44,272
Right, good for you.

340
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:47,401
I feel kind of bad for Jinman.

341
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:51,530
Fuck that. He's dead, and we're alive.
We must go on.

342
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:53,031
All right.

343
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:55,117
The person who captures the niece

344
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,702
or kills her

345
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:58,537
will get a fat bonus too.

346
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:06,837
Everyone! Let's get going.

347
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,965
We'll need to take a piss
and have some snacks on the way.

348
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:12,718
We should leave now
if we want to make it in time.

349
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:16,596
He's the one who wasted time
by taking a shit.

350
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:20,142
Shut your mouth
and go start the car, punk.

351
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:23,478
All right. Let's go now! Chop-chop!

352
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:28,567
Let's go!
