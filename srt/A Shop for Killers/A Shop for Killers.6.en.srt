1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:05,380
14 YEARS AGO

2
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:14,305
Bravo's location is compromised!

3
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:15,682
Send backup now!

4
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:17,642
There's no backup. You must hold out.

5
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:20,520
For fuck's sake!
Do you want us to all die here?

6
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,652
Control, Alpha's four o'clock, east.
RPG 100m away. Take it out now!

7
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:30,321
Control will take out the RPG.
Stay where you are.

8
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,157
Four o'clock, RPG!

9
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:34,743
RPG eliminated.

10
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,709
Sir, if we get hit with one more RPG,

11
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:45,253
we're all done for.

12
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,673
Honey! Mom!

13
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:51,384
-I want to go home.
-If you want to see your honey and mom,

14
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,386
lower your head a little more. Okay?

15
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:01,352
Sir!

16
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,938
We have to get out of here now!
Or we'll all die!

17
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,399
Seongjo's in danger too!

18
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:07,525
Listen up.

19
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:10,862
Our mission is to make sure
he gets back to Korea safely.

20
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,865
That's more important
than our lives, okay?

21
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:15,784
God damn it!

22
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,245
Hang on for three more minutes.

23
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:22,457
If we can't reach Seongjo,
we'll make our way to Bale's car. Got it?

24
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:29,172
Sir, Bale has left area
of operations and is moving towards Bravo.

25
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,256
What?

26
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,652
Goodness!

27
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,153
That son of a bitch.

28
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,822
Get lost, asshole. Damn it!

29
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,532
Thanks.

30
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:57,075
Whoa.

31
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:59,536
You saved my life.

32
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,621
Great job, boy!

33
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,373
Don't move!

34
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:05,416
Put your gun down!

35
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,670
Put it down.

36
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,437
Backup's here.

37
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:32,902
Great timing.

38
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,740
I'll stop the guys who climb the building.

39
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:20,992
You provide backup to our boys.

40
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:23,494
Now.

41
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:25,997
Fine. Okay.

42
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,886
How diligent.

43
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,138
Aren't we?

44
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:01,449
It's Seongjo.

45
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:17,840
-My God.
-Great job.

46
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:22,011
Sir, I really thought today was the day!
I mean it.

47
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,471
The day we go to hell?

48
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,101
When are we going to hell again?

49
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:31,020
-Not today!
-Sure as hell not today!

50
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,608
Sir?

51
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,778
Bale and Seongjo's team
haven't reached the base camp yet.

52
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,405
Did you try the radio?

53
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,824
It's been an hour since radio silence.

54
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,956
Juncheol, get ready to head back first.

55
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,249
-Okay.
-Let's go, Pasin.

56
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,473
Bale?

57
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,684
Do you copy? Answer me.

58
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,437
Where are you?

59
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,403
Do you think something happened?

60
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:22,822
To Bale?

61
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,951
He could survive hell and come back.

62
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,703
Okay? See?

63
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:32,290
After Bale went down,
not a single person has come up here.

64
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,125
It means they're all dead.

65
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:38,004
Go down and search for him
if you're that worried.

66
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,548
I'll catch my breath here.

67
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:43,217
So tired.

68
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:51,809
Hey, rookie.

69
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,647
You were great today.

70
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:59,859
I'd be in hell right now
if it weren't for you.

71
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,195
Not today.

72
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:05,823
Not today!

73
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,314
Help.

74
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:43,653
-Sir, help! Please!
-My son!

75
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:46,155
My son... Our son!

76
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,824
Please, help him!

77
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:52,495
Help! Please save our son!

78
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,975
What do you think you're doing?

79
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:22,692
Damn it.

80
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,361
You found him so quickly, didn't you?

81
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:28,406
Let's get going. Okay?

82
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,534
What's this?

83
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,119
What's wrong?

84
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:35,580
Did you see a ghost?

85
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,332
No, that's not...

86
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,669
Bale killed those civilians...

87
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:44,213
What on earth...

88
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:46,549
Bale, don't tell me...

89
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:49,927
I didn't kill them.

90
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,153
He did.

91
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,660
Is that our story?

92
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:17,246
Then, what about him?

93
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,236
You poor bastard.

94
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,572
How could you go like this?

95
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,659
We would've taken care of everything.

96
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,536
Right?

97
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,751
Jeong, you're here.

98
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,343
What happened?

99
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:18,307
This kid went overboard
trying to save the civilians.

100
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,894
I told him that we should just leave.
Damn.

101
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,774
It was just in his nature.

102
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,322
I hope you attain enlightenment,
Seonghwan.

103
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,063
Wait.

104
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:19,702
There can't be witnesses.

105
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:30,504
A SHOP FOR KILLERS

106
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,760
EPISODE 6
JEONG JINMAN

107
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:40,556
The defendant's mission
was to escort a Korean businessman.

108
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:46,479
The murder
of these nine civilians occurred.

109
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:49,940
Murdered a kilometer away
from the operation area,

110
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,943
and had nothing to do with him.

111
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,823
So let me ask you again.

112
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,953
Did you not see any civilians
in the building

113
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,955
during the operation?

114
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,292
How many times do
I have to tell you? I didn't see anyone.

115
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,002
We barely survived.

116
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,630
How could we know
who was coming and going?

117
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,341
What are you doing? Interpret.

118
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,303
No, I didn't.

119
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:25,393
Did you see the people on the roof
being slaughtered?

120
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:28,896
Those people
on the rooftop weren't civilians.

121
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,690
They were rebels.

122
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:33,901
And those rebels killed the civilians

123
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,237
and even killed our man, Seonghwan!

124
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,364
You'd better interpret properly!

125
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,994
Please answer "yes" or "no."

126
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:49,959
He saved my life!

127
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:59,760
Your Honor, the prosecution
would like to call on Mr. Jeong Jinman,

128
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:03,097
commanding officer of the operation,
as a witness.

129
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,397
You came late,
so you don't know what happened.

130
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,066
Those bastards almost killed me
so many times.

131
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,068
If it wasn't for Bale,

132
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,738
I wouldn't have been
able to help you guys!

133
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,866
Also, that kid had a gun.

134
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,160
It was right to pull the trigger.

135
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:27,455
People like us are killed
by child soldiers all the time.

136
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,999
The gun didn't even have a magazine.

137
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,586
There could've been a bullet
in the chamber.

138
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:36,714
Bale...

139
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:41,302
said there couldn't be any witnesses.

140
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:43,804
What about it?

141
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,642
Witnesses to what?

142
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,400
The bullet lodged in Kim Seonghwan's head

143
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,902
was a .45 caliber.

144
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:01,739
But out of the guns
we collected from the rebels,

145
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,743
there was no .45 caliber gun.

146
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,329
Are you digging up information on us now?

147
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,582
You just need to say what you saw.

148
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,751
Aren't I right?

149
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,420
Let me ask you again.

150
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,548
During the mission,

151
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:25,554
did you or did you not see
the defendant killing civilians?

152
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:38,317
Have you ever looked
at Bale's face properly?

153
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,070
-Excuse me?
-Have you ever looked him in the eye?

154
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,907
He has no soul in his eyes.

155
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,870
He feels no guilt about killing someone.
He's a natural combat machine.

156
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:54,291
He could become a hero
if this were a war between nations, but...

157
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,088
Anyway,

158
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,215
did you know?

159
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,885
You and Bale are similar.

160
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:10,182
There's something creepy about Bale.

161
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:13,727
I'm not sure if he's a human or a monster,
and he scares me sometimes,

162
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,729
but when we're together,

163
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,982
it reassures me that I won't die today.

164
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:21,569
That I won't be going to hell today.
It puts me at ease!

165
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,363
But it's not like that with you.

166
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:28,742
To you, the mission is always
more important than our lives.

167
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:29,869
Am I wrong?

168
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,997
You're cold as ice too.

169
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:37,001
You keep your composure
even in bloodbaths.

170
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,752
We're different.

171
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,006
I don't enjoy those situations.

172
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,632
But he...

173
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:48,721
Jinman.

174
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:52,433
We're mercenaries.
We're not soldiers anymore.

175
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,603
When you carry out
those types of operations,

176
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,688
collateral damage is inevitable.

177
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,648
Inevitable collateral damage...

178
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,652
and deliberate murder are different.

179
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,240
Sir! I need your answer!

180
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:15,956
I didn't.

181
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,043
Due to lack of evidence,

182
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,755
the defendant was found

183
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,340
not guilty.

184
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,822
You are both precious to me.

185
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,868
The only person who can control Bale

186
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:55,496
is you.

187
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:09,510
I understand.

188
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,888
But I have one condition.

189
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:16,976
From now on,

190
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,603
don't put Bale in my operations.

191
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,933
What the fuck?

192
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,185
I think I got some on me.

193
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:16,660
Honestly, I didn't think
our captain would do that in court.

194
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:20,664
I mean, he's always been
such a stickler for rules.

195
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,919
I was worried that
he'd screw us over in court.

196
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:31,175
But it turned out
he was the loyal type, right?

197
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,010
Of course, family comes first.

198
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,012
I see him in a new light now.

199
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,096
Don't you agree?

200
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,057
Shut the fuck up, Seongjo.

201
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,433
Your dick will fall off.

202
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,685
You talk too much.

203
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,730
Too... What?

204
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,073
Why are you coming to me?

205
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:57,993
Did you fucking curse at me?

206
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:08,420
By the way, you seemed very dissatisfied
with the judge's ruling.

207
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,466
I'm more dissatisfied
with your bad breath right now.

208
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,885
Go brush your teeth
and play with the twins.

209
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,851
What's with your head?

210
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,146
Your Korean has improved.

211
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,148
You can even joke around now.

212
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,067
It wasn't a joke.

213
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,236
Twins, take him away.

214
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:37,116
You little bastard...

215
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,702
They say experience is the best teacher...

216
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,209
Wow, you're fast.

217
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,877
Gurkhas sure are different.

218
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,965
Gurkhas are from Nepal. I'm from Thailand.

219
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,175
That's right.

220
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,927
You can bite, can't you?

221
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,429
But you know what? So can I.

222
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:03,892
Go ahead and try to kill me if you dare.

223
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,742
Yeah, okay. You'll die today.

224
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,286
Twins, you can come too.

225
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:23,412
Come on.

226
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,830
What the fuck?

227
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:26,123
Pasin.

228
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:28,709
Lee Seongjo, that's enough.

229
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,336
Twins, take your knives out.

230
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,172
Come at me all at once.

231
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,548
Come on.

232
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,053
Seongjo.

233
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:42,472
Sit down.

234
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:49,104
This bastard...

235
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,551
Keep your promise.

236
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,012
I don't want Bale in this mission.

237
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,849
Right, I should keep my promise.

238
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,560
But...

239
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,146
the mission

240
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,357
is a little bigger this time.

241
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:37,194
It's the biggest drug supplier
into China from Laos.

242
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:38,278
We can do it

243
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,322
-without Bale...
-I know that.

244
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:43,367
It's not because
I don't trust your abilities.

245
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,035
It's just...

246
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,329
If...

247
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,290
you fail this mission,

248
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:54,002
the company will bear a huge loss.
That's the problem.

249
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:56,630
So for this mission,

250
00:20:57,464 --> 00:21:00,884
upper management has made this decision.
My hands are tied.

251
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:04,179
Also, there are no civilians
who will get in the way

252
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,139
around the area of operations.

253
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:07,808
Yonghan!

254
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,476
I promise.

255
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,103
This is the last time.

256
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:15,524
After this mission,
I'll exclude Bale from your operations.

257
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:18,902
Upper management and Bale
have both agreed on this.

258
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,654
This will be the last.

259
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:31,123
It doesn't matter who you kill,

260
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,542
but capture this man alive.

261
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:37,254
Get him before Bale kills him.

262
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,340
Jinman.

263
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:01,820
Bale.

264
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,574
I'm warning you.

265
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,286
Don't cause trouble by acting alone
like you did before.

266
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,621
I'll get Tao.

267
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,123
Bale.

268
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:16,710
Get back here.

269
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,004
I'm not done talking.

270
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,862
I'll get Tao. You take care of the rest.

271
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:47,741
If we run into any locals,
we'll hand them over to the cops.

272
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,118
-Captain.
-Got it?

273
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:54,456
You don't want me on the team, do you?

274
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:58,960
Am I wrong?

275
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,967
Stop talking nonsense and answer me.

276
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:11,223
The way you looked at me
in court that day...

277
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,186
You looked like you wanted to kill me.

278
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,110
Answer me.

279
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,202
Okay.

280
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:10,866
Get up.

281
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,756
Captain said to hand over
unarmed men to the police.

282
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:25,899
They're armed now.

283
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,068
And I'm unarmed.

284
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,852
God, it reeks of blood.

285
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:48,356
You cleaned the place up, huh?

286
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,358
Where's Captain?

287
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:31,107
Let go of me! Fuck!

288
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:44,496
They got Tao.

289
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,500
Already?

290
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,921
Seongjo.

291
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,799
-What's this!
-Buy something nice.

292
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:58,176
Not hard cash.

293
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:00,762
Don't you know anything about loot?

294
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:02,681
Why do you have two?

295
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,600
Is it buy one, get one free?

296
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:09,562
Shit, mine feels kind of thin.

297
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:12,691
It seems they were partying with women.

298
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:23,493
Seongjo, I checked over there.

299
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,246
They indeed are twins.

300
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:27,789
They're both clueless.

301
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,916
Do you think I'm looking for survivors?

302
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:36,256
Wow, is that...

303
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,598
It's fake. Fuck.

304
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:50,395
What?

305
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:52,188
What's that?

306
00:28:58,653 --> 00:28:59,654
Goodness.

307
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,407
Hey, did you check here?

308
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,495
Shit.

309
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,626
What?

310
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:24,095
Oh, fuck. Didn't they say
there wouldn't be civilians?

311
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:46,576
Help. Please. Help!

312
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:49,829
It's okay.

313
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:51,456
Please.

314
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:52,540
Stay here.

315
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,292
Don't worry.

316
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,764
Hey, give me the thing.

317
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:20,652
Bale, what are you going to do with that?

318
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,647
Hey, Captain...

319
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:15,623
It's just, I found those women,

320
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,418
but they all died like that.

321
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:25,967
Was it you?

322
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,984
Wow... You sure are fast.

323
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:45,111
I clearly told you

324
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:48,573
not to act alone,
and if civilians were found...

325
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,867
The general said
there would be no civilians.

326
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:53,953
So you killed them all?

327
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,341
As always,

328
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:11,012
your eyes don't lie.

329
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:17,393
I guess today's the day I go to hell.

330
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:21,606
Pull it.

331
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:26,945
Jeong, we're family. Don't do this.

332
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,867
We'll all die if you don't stop.

333
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:38,331
Hey, put all your guns down.

334
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:42,126
What do you think you're doing
to the captain?

335
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,093
Everyone, guns down.

336
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:03,898
I'm going to report this to the company.

337
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,319
Blast everything here and return to base.

338
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,784
All right. You all heard the man.

339
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:19,247
Let's finish this quickly
and go home, okay?

340
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,628
If you're going to kill me,
do it quickly.

341
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,166
Who are you?

342
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,382
What a long day.

343
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,699
Go on ahead. I'll stay here and...

344
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:02,368
Sir, I'll stay behind and help you.

345
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:06,080
No, I'm going to hand Bale over
to the inspection team when we get there.

346
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,166
So make sure to stay with him.

347
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:53,753
Do you want to live?

348
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:00,092
Let's get out of here.

349
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,647
You stayed behind
to have some fun?

350
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:45,888
Run!

351
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,411
Do you know
why I'm a mercenary?

352
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,124
I just like killing people.

353
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:16,168
That's why I applied to become one.

354
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:21,048
Because as long as I follow
some simple rules,

355
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:24,552
I make money killing people
as much as I want.

356
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,890
Protection of civilians
and no friendly fire...

357
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:32,935
Don't try to force those principles on me.

358
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,354
It makes me

359
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:38,816
just want to kill everyone,
allies or enemies.

360
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,863
In the end, we're the same type of people,

361
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:46,282
Jeong Jinman.

362
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:51,996
We both get paid to kill people.

363
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,582
Stop pretending to be righteous.
It makes me gag.

364
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:12,558
That's the face you make
when you're scared.

365
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:38,102
Is that all you got?

366
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:52,718
Jeong Jinman.

367
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:55,971
You listen to me.

368
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:58,682
If you don't kill me now,

369
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,144
I'm going to kill

370
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:04,355
your entire family,

371
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:08,275
your friends, and anyone
who has anything to do with you.

372
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:12,363
Then, I'll kill you last.

373
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:16,575
Die, you son of a bitch!

374
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,474
We have to go now!
Hurry!

375
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:03,247
After we set the bombs,

376
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:05,666
as we were trying to leave the building,

377
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:09,086
we were met with the rest of the rebels.

378
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:14,008
They almost got me...

379
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,595
when Bale came to help.

380
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:21,765
We fought together.

381
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,477
Then, the bombs went off.

382
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:30,691
I was close to the entrance,
so I was able to escape.

383
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:32,985
But Bale...

384
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:41,118
There was no time
to stay and recover the body.

385
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:13,025
Is it because of what happened?

386
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:16,195
That's one of the reasons.

387
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:19,073
I've been working long enough.

388
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,116
I want a break.

389
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:38,467
LEE YONGHAN

390
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:53,357
It's me.

391
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:57,361
Put someone on Jeong Jinman.

392
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:04,702
My word.

393
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:09,790
Damn...

394
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:15,421
I thought you'd be different.

395
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:20,509
I guess psychopaths are
just as mortal as us.

396
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:35,065
What's this?

397
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:38,360
Wow...

398
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:40,779
Hi, baby.

399
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,282
Why were you in the dark like that?

400
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,703
Thanks, Bale.

401
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:57,856
I thought Bale was made of steel.

402
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:01,527
But he went to hell before us.

403
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:08,075
Please attain enlightenment, Bale.

404
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:51,535
I hear you're taking time off.

405
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:58,709
I know it wasn't too long ago
that we almost shot each other,

406
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,962
but I still think we're a team.

407
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:05,966
I hope you come back soon.

408
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:09,511
So that we can make more money with you.

409
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:52,197
Hello?

410
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,324
Hey, it's me.

411
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:56,368
Who is this?

412
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:58,996
It's me.
Your little brother, Jeong Jinman.

413
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:00,872
Hey, you little bastard!

414
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:01,957
Where are you?

415
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:04,334
Do you have any idea what's going on?

416
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:07,629
-You call after eight years...
-It's good to hear your voice too.

417
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:09,297
I don't feel the same at all!

418
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:22,060
It's okay. He's your uncle.

419
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:44,666
What's your name?

420
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:48,378
Jian. Jeong Jian.

421
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:55,552
A SHOP FOR KILLERS

422
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:21,578
Oh, my. What's gotten into me?

423
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:23,872
I'm on a roll today.

424
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:57,739
Bale?
