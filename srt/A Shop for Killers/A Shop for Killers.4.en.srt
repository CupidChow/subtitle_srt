1
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:04,671
<i>Order in the court!</i>

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,424
Prosecutor, please continue.

3
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:09,926
Let me ask you again.

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,886
During the mission,

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:17,851
did you or did you not see
the defendant killing civilians?

6
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:35,660
Sir, I need your answer!

7
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:49,924
Why aren't you answering it? Isn't it Mom?

8
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,013
Who is it?

9
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,556
<i>Sir, this is Juncheol.</i>

10
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,350
How did you get this number?

11
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,019
<i>That's not important right now.</i>

12
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,605
<i>Bale is still alive.</i>

13
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,148
<i>I can't talk for long.</i>

14
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:08,610
<i>He's on his way to your mom's funeral</i>
<i>with Lee Seongjo.</i>

15
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:25,627
HONDA, BALE'S ALIVE.
HE'S AFTER MY FAMILY. PROTECT JIAN.

16
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:44,771
Please, answer your phone! Come on!

17
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,492
What the hell?

18
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,704
I'm so sorry,

19
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,082
but my phone died.

20
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:06,000
Can I borrow your phone?

21
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,044
I have to call the insurance company.

22
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,033
Fuck!

23
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:46,082
A SHOP FOR KILLERS

24
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,337
EPISODE 4
THE SHOPPING MALL

25
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,292
Turn off your light!

26
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:35,048
What the fuck?

27
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:36,799
How thrilling.

28
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,364
Second floor, center!

29
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:17,757
Cease fire!

30
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:57,130
<i>Mr. Kim, how's it going?</i>

31
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,214
Shit.

32
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,926
Come in. Mr. Kim.

33
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,304
<i>- Can you hear me?</i>
<i>- </i>

34
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,388
Hey, Mr. Kim...

35
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,557
What the hell?

36
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:32,457
Today's not your lucky day.

37
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,051
Attain enlightenment, buddy.

38
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:52,685
What the fuck's going on?
Are they all dead?

39
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,521
They can't even take
what's handed to them.

40
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,610
For God's sake.

41
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:07,825
What's taking you guys so long?
Hurry up, will you?

42
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,167
Shoot the ceiling!

43
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:16,013
You should've
secured your visibility

44
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,266
first in the dark, Mr. Kim.

45
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,813
You've finally lost your touch.

46
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:24,457
Minhye.

47
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,791
Someone like you

48
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,252
is worth taking to hell with me.

49
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:24,934
Goodbye, Mr. Kim.

50
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,240
Oh... Hi, Jeong Jian.

51
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,120
I'm Brother.

52
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,636
Put that on your wrists.

53
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,930
Put it on Bae Jeongmin.

54
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,391
What?

55
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:08,144
How... do you know me?

56
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,335
What?

57
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,013
<i>I feel like I can spin it all night.</i>

58
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:28,432
<i>These six have rented out the ride.</i>

59
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:29,850
<i>You all must be rich.</i>

60
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:35,815
<i>The girl with her eyes shut and the guy</i>
<i>in the leather jacket. Are you related?</i>

61
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,275
<i>- Or a couple?</i>
- Don't worry. Hold onto me.

62
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,361
<i>What? You're holding hands?</i>

63
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,780
<i>Look at that.</i>

64
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:45,157
<i>I can't let that happen. Attack!</i>

65
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,957
<i>What's this? This isn't right.</i>

66
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,500
<i>You can't sit there.</i>

67
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,502
<i>- How will you explain this?</i>
- Junmyeon.

68
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:57,628
Don't move.

69
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:59,338
You'll fall if you move again.

70
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:04,134
<i>By the way, this girl has</i>
<i>the strongest legs I have ever seen!</i>

71
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,136
<i>Look at her hold on!</i>

72
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,095
Thanks.

73
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,893
I'll be going, then.

74
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:02,776
Jian.

75
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,238
You're going to leave like that?

76
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,032
What?

77
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:19,251
Is there something more to do
before I go in?

78
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,380
You really

79
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,841
don't have a clue, do you?

80
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,162
Your muffler has a hole.

81
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,831
I'll fix it for 50,000 won.

82
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,044
This is my uncle.

83
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,088
What?

84
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,632
Oh... Hello.

85
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:14,640
Isn't it illegal for a teenager to ride
a motorcycle? No helmet, illegal mods.

86
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,268
Show me your license.

87
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,939
Come on, sir.

88
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,816
You're so old-fashioned.

89
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,819
Let the kids be lovey-dovey.

90
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,654
Jian, keep going.

91
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:31,323
Still, I need to check.

92
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,950
Show me your license.

93
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,413
I... I didn't bring it with me today.

94
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:40,749
I should go.

95
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:42,835
Have a good night.

96
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,880
I'll go with you.

97
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,091
- I'll call you!
-Come here.

98
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,304
Why are you getting on?

99
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:55,764
Drop me off at the store.

100
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:59,810
Did you see how he didn't bow his head
as he greeted me?

101
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:12,114
One bulgogi burger and two shrimp burgers.

102
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,199
She's been working here for a while.

103
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:17,911
Didn't you know? She works two jobs.
She works at the gimbap shop too.

104
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,830
She still lives with her uncle?

105
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:22,541
It could be her uncle, lover, or pimp.
Who knows?

106
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,294
Hey, it's her uncle.

107
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,545
- Okay.
- So sensitive.

108
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:28,505
- So sensitive.
- I'm not sensitive!

109
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,466
- You're disgusting.
- She's always like this.

110
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,550
Why?

111
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:32,968
Does she not have parents?

112
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,722
That's right. You wouldn't know.

113
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,474
You transferred in middle school.

114
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,558
Listen.

115
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,894
Her mom and dad...

116
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,687
Stop. Do you want her to hit you

117
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,481
- with a chair again?
- Wait! My PTSD!

118
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,607
My head!

119
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,692
Enjoy your meal.

120
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,195
Minsook,
don't you hang out with her?

121
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:14,176
Let's go somewhere else.

122
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,260
- Why?
-What? Why?

123
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,804
-Go somewhere else.
-Why?

124
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,180
- What?
-Let's go. Come on.

125
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,556
-What is it?
-Just...

126
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,558
-Do you know her?
-She's no one.

127
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,662
<i>They have confiscated</i>
<i>400 unauthorized guns,</i>

128
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:44,706
<i>five crossbows, and 32 stun guns.</i>

129
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,585
<i>If you are caught carrying</i>
<i>or using weapons without a permit,</i>

130
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:51,255
<i>you could be imprisoned</i>
<i>for three to 15 years...</i>

131
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,390
Why did you act that way to Minsook?

132
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,394
In middle school

133
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,688
when Minsook came over.

134
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,817
You came into my room,
stared at her for ten minutes,

135
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,236
and got misunderstood for a pervert.

136
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,321
It lost me my only friend.

137
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,699
Also, my tutor, Jinki.

138
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,243
He was just messing around a little.

139
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:24,288
You just had to threaten him
to do his job properly

140
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,915
and make him quit the next day.

141
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:30,669
Listen up, Jian.

142
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:36,466
First off,

143
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:40,429
Minsook stole my watch that day.

144
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:45,058
I only looked at her to confirm that.

145
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,686
She apologized to me
and returned my watch.

146
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,521
That was the end of it.

147
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,606
Second,

148
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,316
your tutor, Kim Jinki...

149
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,903
Well, in the end,

150
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,530
he was arrested for molestation
a week later.

151
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,117
As your legal guardian
who must protect you,

152
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,952
I think I did my best.

153
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,792
Then, what about Junmyeon?

154
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,253
What did he do so wrong?

155
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,509
It's illegal for a high schooler
to ride a motorcycle.

156
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:20,594
He had no helmet.

157
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,387
He even smokes!

158
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,889
He reeked of it.

159
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:26,016
Come on!

160
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,358
Uncle.

161
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,818
Do you know why I work so many jobs?

162
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,864
I'm saving up to move out of here.

163
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,036
I've thought about

164
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,247
why I'm so different

165
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:50,249
from the other kids.

166
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:55,045
I know you raised me,

167
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:56,922
but...

168
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,718
why does it feel like
you're locking me up?

169
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,395
I know I'm not a model student.

170
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:15,023
But I'm not a problem child either.

171
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,901
Why do you meddle in everything?

172
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,656
I want to hang out with friends
like the other kids.

173
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:24,449
I want to date too.

174
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,034
Am I not allowed?

175
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:28,662
Well?

176
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,960
Then, make a bet with me.

177
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,422
My face.

178
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,092
I'll let you move out
if you can hit it even once.

179
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,014
I'm being serious.

180
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,640
So am I.

181
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,435
Are you done eating?

182
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,520
I'll put them away.

183
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,109
Are you hiding something from me?

184
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,571
Mom and Dad...

185
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:07,075
Did they really die the way
that everyone talks about?

186
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,625
Honestly, I don't remember.

187
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:19,671
Isn't it time you told me?

188
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:28,805
Will you take the bet?

189
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,352
It took a lot for me
to bring this up to you!

190
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:35,645
What's wrong with you?

191
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,856
Why do you always avoid the subject?

192
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:41,818
Forget it if you don't want to move out.

193
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,118
Damn it!

194
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:52,621
You're so slow.

195
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:58,710
You do the dishes.

196
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,090
Darn it!

197
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,716
You're so annoying!

198
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:10,514
Turn right.

199
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:13,183
There you go.

200
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:15,394
Come on.

201
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,854
Great job, Jian.

202
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,523
Slowly.

203
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:21,900
Bring it down.

204
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:23,110
Okay!

205
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:25,695
Wow, Jian!

206
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,240
You pass.

207
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,117
You've got a knack for it.

208
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:32,828
Great job.

209
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:13,452
Put the forklift back where it was
and come eat.

210
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:15,996
Darn it.

211
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:23,670
Damn it.

212
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:27,966
Move! Move!

213
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:29,634
I said move!

214
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:31,428
Get out of my way!

215
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,056
What are you doing, Jian?

216
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,516
You're scaring me!

217
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,185
Fighting with your family

218
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:39,686
makes you a bitch.

219
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:42,147
Stay out of it!
It's a family matter, Pasin!

220
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:49,196
Did you just hit me?

221
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,574
You're too slow. You're like a slug.

222
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,367
You won't even touch his hair.

223
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:55,660
Can't touch.

224
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:02,542
Why are you all on my case?

225
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,462
Let go of me!

226
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:06,713
Let go!

227
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:08,215
Let go of me!

228
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,091
Hey! Let go!

229
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,348
Let...

230
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,118
You're getting it all wrong.

231
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,996
How do you get it wrong every time?

232
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,166
You're so annoying.
Worry about yourself.

233
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:55,679
I took it out!

234
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,306
Look. You got it wrong again.

235
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,559
How do you keep getting
the distance wrong?

236
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,686
Stop nagging me.

237
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,023
Did I...

238
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,901
pass out?

239
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,361
Jian is up.

240
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,698
You must've been tired.
Don't study so hard.

241
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:18,285
Did I pass out?

242
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:20,829
Yes.

243
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:24,624
How could you

244
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:27,669
make your niece pass out?

245
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,129
- What?
- She's right.

246
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,257
I didn't do it. He did.

247
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,758
Right. What?

248
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:38,096
You're shameless, Jinman.
You told me to do it.

249
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:40,515
When did I?

250
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:43,476
You're such a liar.

251
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,021
Fuck you... Die!

252
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:49,899
You told me to do it. You made me.

253
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:51,234
Unbelievable. When?

254
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,113
Hey!

255
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:01,494
Put the forklift back where it was.

256
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:29,606
What's your hand?

257
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,233
Give me your head.

258
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:38,031
You lose, you get hit.

259
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:40,617
Bums.

260
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:42,118
Pay first.

261
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:44,663
Okay.

262
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:50,377
Pasin, what you did to me earlier.

263
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:51,878
Teach me how to do it.

264
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:01,680
You want me to teach you Muay Thai
so you can hit Jinman?

265
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:03,390
Yes.

266
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:05,809
No.

267
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,144
Yes, Master.

268
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,650
Just creep up on him
and hit him while he's sleeping.

269
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,528
Oh...

270
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,991
But isn't that cheating?

271
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,411
It seems too easy too.

272
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:27,831
Do you think it'd be easy?

273
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:35,088
I want to move out of my uncle's place.

274
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,716
He's frustrating. I can't live with him.

275
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:42,303
The Muay Thai that I do is tough.

276
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,680
You can't do it.

277
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:44,764
I can.

278
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,059
I'll do everything you tell me to do.

279
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:55,608
Three times a week. 500,000 won a month.

280
00:28:57,527 --> 00:29:00,488
I'm in high school.
I don't have that kind of money.

281
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:03,283
Jian.

282
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:08,872
I have to send my son
to a private school next year.

283
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:13,042
So I need a lot of money,
but I don't have any right now.

284
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:15,962
I should just die.

285
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:22,594
Even with my paychecks,

286
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:26,556
the most I can get is 50,000 won a week.

287
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:30,643
Deal.

288
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:40,779
Follow me.

289
00:29:58,254 --> 00:29:59,255
Wow.

290
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:13,102
First lesson.

291
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,854
We're starting now?

292
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,482
Try to block me.

293
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,031
One, two.

294
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:27,116
- One, two.
- Keep your elbows up.

295
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,451
Always remember this box.

296
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,167
Don't lose balance.

297
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:52,141
<i>Why do you play with my heart?</i>

298
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,393
Jian?

299
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:55,311
<i>With you...</i>

300
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:58,314
You're too stiff.

301
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,440
You're all talk.

302
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,455
Barely breaks even.

303
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,292
One, two.

304
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:19,919
You're a slug.

305
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,173
Slug, you're so slow!

306
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,800
Get up, Slug.

307
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:31,848
Hello!

308
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:46,696
What are you doing?

309
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,953
- Put me down.
- So slow, Slug.

310
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:09,177
<i>I must've been nothing to you</i>

311
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:29,590
- Hey, hurry...
- Jian?

312
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,510
What the hell?

313
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:42,687
You're pretty.

314
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,399
Who were those kids? Your friends?

315
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:47,650
We're better than them.

316
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,861
Did we scare you?

317
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,487
You're a pretty thing.

318
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:53,573
- Hey, show us your face.
-Cha Minsook?

319
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:54,866
- Hey.
- Jian!

320
00:33:58,619 --> 00:33:59,704
- Hey!
- What the hell?

321
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:00,788
What the fuck?

322
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,585
-Damn.
- Who the fuck are you?

323
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:10,381
You ruined everything!

324
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:16,179
What is that? Green onions?
Is this a fucking joke?

325
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:18,639
This is good. I was hungry.
I'm craving <i>ramyeon.</i>

326
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,641
Hey.

327
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:23,644
She ran away,
so you have to make up for it.

328
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:26,064
Can you handle it?

329
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,233
Fuck.

330
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,320
Who the fuck am I talking to?

331
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:34,864
What? What's that glare?

332
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:39,744
What is it? What are you trying to do?

333
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:52,381
Damn. Are you a boxer or something?

334
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,550
What is it? Do you want to play?

335
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:06,437
What the...

336
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:35,466
You must not be from around here.
That's enough.

337
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,638
Hey!

338
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,341
Listen up, Jian.

339
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:22,847
I know you've become stronger
after learning to fight from Pasin,

340
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:25,725
but it's not enough

341
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,269
to beat a man holding a knife.

342
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:32,106
Just run away next time.

343
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,695
Drop me off at Master Pasin's place.

344
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:42,742
My money!
I need my 350,000 won to pay rent!

345
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:44,911
I haven't seen him
for two or three days.

346
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,414
- He took 500,000 won from me.
-Everyone, calm down.

347
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:49,957
We're checking everything now.

348
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:53,085
- Just wait.
- What's going on?

349
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:54,337
Jian!

350
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,713
Pasin, that bastard!

351
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:58,049
He borrowed money and ran off.

352
00:36:58,132 --> 00:36:59,675
- What?
- Not just me!

353
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:02,428
Everyone here lent him money.

354
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,432
What do we do? We're done for!

355
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:08,142
Is there a Jeong Jian here?

356
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:09,685
That's me.

357
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:22,114
<i>Jian,</i>
<i>you're not a slug anymore.</i>

358
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,752
What is this?

359
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,255
Is that your school?

360
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,265
There's one in the bathroom.

361
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:01,988
You're insane!

362
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,956
Who are you?
How long have you been watching me?

363
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,291
Who made all of this?

364
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,294
Was it my uncle?

365
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,504
It's not the time for this, Jian.

366
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,007
Minhye is out of bullets.

367
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,009
More guys will come soon!

368
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:25,803
It won't stop here. The boss said so!

369
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:30,433
Minhye can't die if we want to stop them.

370
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:34,937
We have to go out there
and give her more bullets and medicine!

371
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,107
What the hell are you saying?

372
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:57,335
Wait... That's too bright!

373
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:59,045
That's too bright! It's bright!

374
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:02,631
Xeroderma... pigmentosum.

375
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:04,091
Xeroderma pigmentosum!

376
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:05,676
If... I...

377
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,470
If I'm exposed to light...

378
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:09,263
for a long time, it hurts!

379
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,349
Turn off the lights...

380
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:14,185
Hurry! Turn off the lights!

381
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:15,978
You haven't answered me yet!

382
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:22,109
What is all of this?

383
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,695
How long have you been watching me
from here?

384
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:54,308
You came to this house...

385
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:58,062
on June 26, 2009.

386
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:00,106
I came to this house

387
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:02,650
on June 20, 2009.

388
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,235
In just...

389
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:10,699
We have to be careful.

390
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:14,078
He's pretending to be pitiful
to evoke sympathy.

391
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,667
I don't know why he's here,

392
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:22,920
but it's true he spied on you.

393
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:29,552
I'm going to try to figure out
the shopping mall's system.

394
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:32,304
We'll be able to get
proper information on your uncle.

395
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:33,806
Okay.

396
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:49,864
What is this?

397
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:53,159
Why does a mere weapons shopping mall

398
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:56,203
have a server room like this?

399
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:09,258
Jeong... Jian!

400
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,597
Don't trust him!

401
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,168
Hey, open this right now!

402
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:35,261
Damn it!

403
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:13,173
What's going on?

404
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:32,443
What do I do now?

405
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:34,361
No.

406
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:42,536
Let me go.

407
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,752
Get this off me, asshole.

408
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:23,118
<i>Jeong Jian?</i>

409
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,498
<i>Open the second drawer to your right.</i>

410
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:44,848
MURTHEHELP
HANDOVER GUIDE

411
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:55,776
<i>One.</i>

412
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:58,654
<i>If the owner of murthehelp,</i>

413
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:01,532
<i>Jeong Jinman, dies or is absent</i>
<i>due to an accident,</i>

414
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:03,784
<i>then Jeong Jinman's niece, Jeong Jian,</i>

415
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:06,078
<i>will inherit murthehelp.</i>

416
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:09,081
Two. After Jeong Jian inherits murthehelp,

417
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:13,836
she will faithfully cooperate
with the handover and carry out her duties

418
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:18,590
<i>such as accounting,</i>
<i>management, and personnel tasks.</i>

419
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:19,675
<i>Three!</i>

420
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:22,761
<i>During the handover, Jeong Jian</i>

421
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:25,472
<i>is allowed to give up her inheritance.</i>

422
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,641
<i>She'll take responsibility after signing.</i>

423
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:33,355
<i>Six. Whether the handover proceeds</i>
<i>according to these regulations...</i>

424
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:35,566
<i>The necessary measures must be taken.</i>

425
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:37,151
<i>Ten.</i>

426
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:38,819
<i>As an employee of murthehelp,</i>

427
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:43,240
I promise to obey
whatever the owner of murthehelp orders,

428
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:44,700
no matter what.

429
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:47,828
I also promise to risk my life if need be.

430
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,330
<i>I... read it all.</i>

431
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:55,669
<i>Now, tell me if you consent to take over</i>

432
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,421
<i>murthehelp.</i>

433
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,966
Do you see a pen and paper in there?

434
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:10,976
I CONSENT

435
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:18,609
YOU'LL REALLY OBEY ME?

436
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:30,287
GET ME OUT OF HERE NOW!

437
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,648
The boss planned all of this.

438
00:46:57,731 --> 00:46:58,857
He expected

439
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:02,653
that he would die
and murthehelp would be attacked.

440
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:04,655
Now, just follow my guide...

441
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:08,909
Let Jeongmin

442
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,661
go.

443
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:15,499
No.

444
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,501
I... can't.

445
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:19,795
You said you'd risk your life and obey me.

446
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,673
That's what you said.

447
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:24,800
Don't you remember?

448
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:28,929
Let Jeongmin go!

449
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:34,893
Anything but...

450
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:36,436
Not that...

451
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,398
There's a reason for this.

452
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:41,233
What is it?

453
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:44,736
The boss...

454
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:49,116
died because of Bae Jeongmin.

455
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:12,139
Jeongmin!

456
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:22,941
Stop it.

457
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:25,819
What are you doing, Jian?

458
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:30,073
Do you... Do you seriously believe him?

459
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:38,373
Shut up!

460
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:47,174
No.

461
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:48,800
No, Jian.

462
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:50,510
Jian.

463
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:53,138
Think about it.

464
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:55,098
I was with you

465
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:57,351
when we almost died upstairs an hour ago.

466
00:48:57,976 --> 00:48:59,770
And a strange woman drugged me.

467
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:01,021
Don't you remember?

468
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:04,650
I helped build the hardware website.

469
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:07,235
I helped with your uncle's funeral!

470
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:09,237
But I'm the one that made him die?

471
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:12,366
You probably erased
the evidence during the funeral.

472
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:14,117
Erased what?

473
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:17,245
I'm the one that found his phone,
and because of that

474
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:19,414
all of this happened and I almost died.

475
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:24,920
Jian.

476
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:27,005
What about him?

477
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:29,299
How do we know why or when he came here?

478
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:33,011
He's been here in the basement
while you two lived upstairs?

479
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:35,639
Does that make sense?

480
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,933
Is he a parasite or what?

481
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:39,351
Jeong... Jian.

482
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:43,230
Don't you think... it's strange?

483
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:44,481
Shut your mouth!

484
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:47,943
You're a pervert
who spied on Jian's naked body!

485
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:49,027
No!

486
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:54,074
Your uncle...

487
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:58,370
would never commit suicide.

488
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,376
Jian.

489
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,837
- Jian, don't listen to him--
- Wait!

490
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:14,553
I want to hear what he has to say.

491
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:21,393
Of course. Sure, Jian.

492
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:24,688
But... But think carefully about it.

493
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:28,483
This is ridiculous and so unfair.

494
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:29,568
Okay?

495
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,325
Keep going.

496
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:40,829
He came to your uncle.

497
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:43,790
Then, the boss died.

498
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:46,043
If you're curious,

499
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:48,962
open the video file labeled "0404"

500
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:52,090
on the main screen of the computer.

501
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:55,635
You...

502
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,137
What are you up to?

503
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:58,847
Are you a hacker?

504
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,161
No!

505
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:24,748
No, don't click it.

506
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:26,166
The moment you click it,

507
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:27,918
we don't know what will happen.

508
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:29,961
The doors here could be disarmed.

509
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:32,047
And the killers might get in.

510
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,925
Look at the facilities here, Jian.

511
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:36,051
No.

512
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,554
Just hurry up and click it.

513
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:40,639
Watch it.

514
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:43,433
He could've controlled everything in here
to kill us.

515
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:46,144
No, no, no! That's not true!

516
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:47,395
He's lying!

517
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:49,439
Just click it and watch the video!

518
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:55,320
Jian... Wait, Jian...

519
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:56,404
Do you remember?

520
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,699
When you were locked
in the school storage room,

521
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:03,620
the person who told your uncle
that you were there...

522
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:06,540
was me.

523
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:25,183
Here.

524
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:26,935
Here!

525
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:54,880
<i>Listen up, Jian.</i>

526
00:53:03,054 --> 00:53:06,183
JIAN
13 YEARS OLD

527
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:07,517
Whatever you choose,

528
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:09,352
I'll leave it to you to decide.

529
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,354
What will you do?

530
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:14,733
Do you want to raise it
or take it to the shelter?

531
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:20,197
I want to raise it.

532
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,365
I already gave it a name.

533
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,034
Dooney.

534
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:26,661
I'm going to make sure Dooney lives.

535
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:30,624
All right. Do that.

536
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,251
However...

537
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:35,045
Listen up, Jian.

538
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:40,550
Every choice you make
comes with responsibilities.

539
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:44,179
If Dooney gets sick and dies,

540
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:48,934
you must take responsibility
for your sadness too.

541
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:24,970
You go.

542
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:27,931
Go

543
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:30,809
and give that woman guns and medicine.

544
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:41,194
Okay.

545
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:08,096
This... is a gift.

546
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:15,228
Can you hand me the beanie?

547
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:27,907
Oh, right.

548
00:55:28,366 --> 00:55:29,367
Do not,

549
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:31,494
under any circumstances,

550
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:34,164
come outside of the shopping mall.

551
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:37,834
Promise!

552
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:39,544
Don't.

553
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:14,412
Who are you?

554
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:18,375
Minhye.

555
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,043
It's me.

556
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:32,806
It's been a long time.

557
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:37,977
You've grown a lot.

558
00:56:41,606 --> 00:56:42,607
Are you okay?

559
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:54,702
Jian.

560
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:56,037
Thank you so much.

561
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:58,581
Thank you so much for choosing me.

562
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:02,669
Yes, sure...

563
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:08,383
But...

564
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:09,968
did you know?

565
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:13,138
When we were young,

566
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:15,974
the person that locked you in...

567
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:19,060
was also me.

568
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:37,912
What was that?

569
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:56,973
I got a dose of that earlier.

570
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:00,351
It works pretty well.

571
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:39,432
Dooney...

572
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:52,737
You...

573
00:58:53,571 --> 00:58:55,073
Who are you?

574
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:06,125
A SHOP FOR KILLERS

575
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:24,018
Wow.

576
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:25,728
How do you use this?

577
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:28,940
Does it have a button?
Is that it? One, two, three.

578
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:32,068
What the heck?

579
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:33,194
Damn!

580
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:37,865
You control it with that computer?
It's like a game controller.

581
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:38,950
Wow...
