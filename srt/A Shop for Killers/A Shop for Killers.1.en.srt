<i>An announcement to all the residents.</i>

00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,100
<i>Until 18:00 hours today,</i>

4
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:20,270
<i>live firearm training</i>
<i>will be conducted on base.</i>

5
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:23,732
<i>It will cause some dust and noise.</i>

6
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:26,818
<i>While this may be</i>
<i>an inconvenience to the residents,</i>

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,698
<i>this training is for the Armed Forces</i>
<i>who must train for national defense.</i>

8
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:33,408
<i>Please, keep that in mind.</i>

9
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:38,496
<i>If you enter the area without permission</i>
<i>while training is in progress,</i>

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:42,333
<i>you could put your lives at risk.</i>

11
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:45,253
<i>To anyone in the vicinity of the area,</i>

12
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:49,340
<i>after you have heard this broadcast,</i>

13
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,926
<i>please evacuate to a safe location</i>

14
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,845
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

15
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:12,197
This is the best weather
to go fishing. Don't you think?

16
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,784
A nice cool cup of <i>makgeolli</i>
would hit the spot right now.

<i>Group 1, Team 1, Team 2.</i>

<i>Nine hundred and fifty meters</i>
<i>to the rabbit.</i>

22
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:38,700
Shit. Why are they bitching
from both sides? It's distracting.

23
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,743
Damn.

24
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:15,570
Jeong Jinman
and his pathetic family portrait.

25
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,157
You've had your share of fun.

26
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,700
You lying bastard.

27
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,134
<i>Focus.</i>

28
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,013
<i>Listen up, Jian.</i>

29
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,238
That's ridiculous.

30
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,324
They can't land a single shot
from both sides?

31
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:44,409
No, no.

32
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,411
The main character

33
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:49,747
is using the blind spots really well
to avoid the bullets.

34
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:53,710
Yeah, right. The movie's over
if the main character dies.

35
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,170
Jeong Jian.

36
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:57,755
Tell me.

37
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:58,965
In this very moment,

38
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,926
do you think
you can see everything perfectly?

39
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,637
Yes, of course.

40
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,097
It's right there. Why not?

41
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:09,350
Oh!

42
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,060
<i>Listen up, Jian.</i>

43
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,855
You're not a dragonfly.

44
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:17,817
You can't see everything
with the human eye. Don't be mistaken.

45
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,612
There are always blind spots.

46
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,825
If you use those blind spots right
like the guy in the movie does,

47
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:28,328
you can even survive a fiery pit.

48
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:31,456
Blind spots.

49
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,570
Jian.

50
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:04,280
What are you doing?

51
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,282
Well?

52
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,506
What the hell?

53
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,637
Oh, baby girl.

54
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,390
You've watched too many movies.

55
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,600
But too bad.

56
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:35,395
I'm too far away.

57
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:36,938
Aren't I?

58
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,289
What are you doing right now?

59
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:24,819
Shit.

60
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,239
<i>It's flying in from the left side.</i>

61
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:30,658
<i>A diagonal direction?</i>

62
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:35,538
<i>The sound of the gunshot came</i>
<i>from much higher and farther away.</i>

63
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:57,477
What?

64
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,062
Where did she go?

65
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,610
- Hey, Bongo.
- Yes?

66
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:06,777
Go forward a bit.

67
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,279
Going forward a bit.

68
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:32,803
What is it?

69
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,264
Are you going to jump from there?

70
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,185
One.

71
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,312
Two.

72
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:42,688
Three.

73
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:15,012
Fuck.

76
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,045
Hey, stop.

77
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,840
- Let go!
Come on. Take it easy! Easy!

78
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,258
-Officer.
Yes?

79
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,135
-Do you know what happened to me?

80
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:58,723
Come on. I'm the one that got hit.
She's the one that hit me!

81
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:01,142
-What?
I'm telling you, I'm the victim!

82
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,435
-Get up!
Calm down!

83
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,937
Get up and kick me like you did earlier!

84
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:08,691
Sir, you're too worked up.
Please calm down, okay?

85
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,611
Excuse me? When can I leave?

86
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:14,739
We're going to obtain the footage
from the security cameras.

87
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,240
You can leave after that.

88
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,408
But...

89
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:20,494
- Did you really beat him like that?
-She beat me!

90
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:23,497
-Calm down so we can hear you.
-What's the problem?

91
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,042
Just let the law punish her.
What's the problem?

92
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,793
-Come on.
Am I wrong?

93
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,760
What?

94
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,476
What?

95
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,866
-What is this?

96
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,242
Can't I go now?

97
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,952
I didn't do anything wrong.

98
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:04,830
He's the one that came
into the women's restroom.

99
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:08,709
I'm not saying you did anything wrong.

100
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:12,588
But you can't just beat up people
like that.

101
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,382
You shouldn't have done that.

102
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:17,176
We wouldn't have to do this
if you had just held him.

103
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:21,263
He says he's going to sue you for assault.

104
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,891
But he tried to throw a punch first.

105
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:27,311
Jian, you can't solve this on your own.

106
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:30,314
Call your guardian.
You need to settle with him.

107
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,275
Can you call your parents
or a family member?

108
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:44,954
CALLING JEONG JINMAN

109
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,091
- Hey, Uncle. It's me.
-<i>Ms. Jeong Jian?</i>

110
00:11:58,718 --> 00:11:59,719
Who is this?

111
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,638
<i>This is Park Jinwoo,</i>
<i>from Yecheong Police Station.</i>

112
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,015
<i>I was just about to call you.</i>

113
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,517
Sorry?

114
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,894
Why would the police call me?

115
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,647
<i>Well...</i>

116
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,150
<i>Please don't be too alarmed.</i>

117
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,485
<i>Mr. Jeong Jinman</i>

118
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,446
<i>is dead.</i>

119
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,009


120
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,186
Why install security bars
on the fifth floor?

121
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:55,816
What kind of crazy thief would climb up
to the fifth floor to steal something?

122
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,861
- I don't even have any money.
- It's done. There.

123
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:00,946
Also, this closet.

124
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,950
I know you paid for it,

125
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,620
but shouldn't you
have considered my taste?

126
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,873
You really think this suits
a 20-year-old girl's room?

127
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:12,625
It's retro.

128
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,794
You kids like retro things.

129
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:16,587
Unbelievable.

130
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,964
Also, take a look at this closet.

131
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,549
It's made of iron, right?

132
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:22,551
It's bulletproof.

133
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,969
It was very expensive.

134
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,139
What if it rains bullets?

135
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,313
Can you hear me?
It sounds bulletproof, right?

136
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,359
You'll be safe in here.

137
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:45,324
Why would it rain bullets here?

138
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,247
Forget it.

139
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:52,998
Just forget it.

140
00:13:58,295 --> 00:13:59,296
Hey, Uncle.

141
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:03,008
Remember the convenience store owner
who shorted me?

142
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:07,096
He got into a car accident a few days ago.
He hurt his arms and legs.

143
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,014
He needs six months in the hospital.

144
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:13,185
I don't know what the accident did to him,

145
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,814
but he called and said he'd wire me
all the money he didn't pay me.

146
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,400
And not just me but all the part-timers.

147
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:20,568
Isn't that crazy?

148
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,405
I was so pissed back then.

149
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,657
JEONG JIAN
KYUNGSEO UNIVERSITY

150
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,286
I did what you taught me and shouted
your name at the sky three times.

151
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,746
- I think that really worked.
- Right.

152
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,124
I did that.

153
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:36,959
I broke his arms and legs.

154
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,298
Uncle.

155
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:46,594
You have a lot of scars on your face,

156
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,429
so you have the face of a criminal.

157
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,390
You can't joke around like that.

158
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,441
Why are you taking pictures of this?

159
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,652
Why are you crossing the line?

160
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:08,282
When a soldier dies in a war,
they lodge their dog tag between the teeth

161
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:11,452
to remember their service number.

162
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:15,289
Your registration number follows you
from birth to death.

163
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:18,042
It means that the number given to you

164
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,877
is very, very important.

165
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:21,921
What are you talking about?

166
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:27,843
It's the same with your school ID number.
Make sure you never forget it.

167
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:30,387
2-2-0-1-9-0-7-4.

168
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,933
Memorize the number all of a sudden?

169
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,602
2-2-0-1-9-0-7-4.

170
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:39,271
2-2-0-1-9-0-7-4.

171
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:42,858
2-2-0-1-9-0-7-4.

172
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,989
The last thing he said to me

173
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,533
is my school ID number.

174
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,707
I was just wondering...

175
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,126
You're Jinman's niece, aren't you?

176
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,588
I'm a friend of Jinman.

177
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,632
We went to the same middle
and high school.

178
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:10,094
I saw you a few times
when you were younger.

179
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,887
I don't know if you remember me.

180
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:15,891
Oh... Hello.

181
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,185
Hi to you too.

182
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:21,063
Wow! You got so big!

183
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:24,525
I heard you attend school in Seoul.
Are you visiting your uncle?

184
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,902
So, how is Jinman?

185
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,197
He's dead.

186
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,914
Don't hold the funeral here.

187
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,667
The funeral home
at that intersection is better.

188
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,211
This place is big,
but it's lousy on the inside.

189
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:46,797
I'll call an employee I know
that works there.

190
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,133
Once you book the room... Hold on.

191
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,386
This is my card.

192
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,346
Call me at this number.

193
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,809
Don't worry too much.

194
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,103
Thank you.

195
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:10,904
HANSARANG GYUNGAE HOSPITAL

196
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,573
Right, we'll verify
the identity of the body now.

197
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,867
Is this Mr. Jeong Jinman?

198
00:17:58,577 --> 00:17:59,661
But I was wondering...

199
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:05,334
When people commit suicide,
don't they normally slit their wrists?

200
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,128
He was alone.

201
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,633
How did he cut his throat like this?

202
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,426
Yes, we investigated it

203
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:18,430
as a possible homicide due to his injury,

204
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:21,266
but no one was caught
on the security cameras

205
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,893
around his house for a week.

206
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,979
Also, according to the autopsy report,

207
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,981
judging by the angle of the wound,

208
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,526
it could have been made by himself.

209
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,112
So we have concluded
that it was a suicide.

210
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,032
If you want,
I can send you the autopsy report.

211
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,120
It's just like him to die like this.

212
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:43,914
Excuse me?

213
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,125
His death suits him.

214
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:49,837
No.

215
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,713
I don't need the autopsy report.

216
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:57,427
Okay. That confirms
the identity of the body.

217
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,930
We'll proceed with the handover procedure.

218
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:02,975
Sign here, and it will be complete.

219
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,109
Then, the handover procedure

220
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:14,194
is now complete.

221
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,293
There are two types of mourning clothes.

222
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,129
This is the common set,
and this is the modern hanbok.

223
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:34,089
You can pick between the two.

224
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,056
<i>Did my uncle</i>
<i>always have that tattoo?</i>

225
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:55,152
Miss! You can't smoke in here!

226
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,030
Oh...

227
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,324
I'm sorry.

228
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,037
Anyway, let me go over it again.

229
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,331
You need to pick a mourning suit.

230
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:10,876
- Here's the hairpin...
- I'm the chief mourner.

231
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:12,836
What about the armband?

232
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:17,257
Oh, normally men wear the armbands.

233
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:20,594
Do you have any close male relatives?

234
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,095
No, there's no one.

235
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,097
Oh...

236
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,310
Well, the most important thing
is the portrait of the deceased.

237
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,687
Do you have a picture of the deceased?

238
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,266
Jeong Jian?

239
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,188
It is you.

240
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,151
Do you remember me?

241
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:19,736
Bae Jeongmin.

242
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:22,906
Huh?

243
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:27,911
Are you okay?

244
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,753
Yeah, I remember you. Bae Jeongmin.

245
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,472
We can cut out the picture
of your uncle's face

246
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,099
and stick it on like this.

247
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:57,816
Oh.

248
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,985
I major in computer engineering.

249
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:01,820
This is easy.

250
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,448
I see.

251
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,577
That's how I came to help your uncle.

252
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,914
After the military service,
I came back home

253
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,917
and saw your uncle's notice
looking for part-time help.

254
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:21,298
He was trying to revamp
his agricultural hose sales website.

255
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:25,052
So I was working on it for a few days.

256
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:28,805
During that time...

257
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:34,561
your uncle passed away.

258
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:37,564
That's why

259
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:39,983
I was the last person to contact him.

260
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,904
And I'm the one the police called first.

261
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,240
I don't know what to say...

262
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,869
I don't know how to console you.

263
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,168
Your uncle was found
in the bathroom, right?

264
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,545
Have you cleaned it up?

265
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,674
No, not yet.

266
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,346
Jian.

267
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:11,515
If it's too hard for you,

268
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,101
do you want me to clean it up?

269
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,938
Your uncle and I were pretty close.

270
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:20,065
I think it'll be okay for me to do it.

271
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,160
I would

272
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,079
really appreciate it.

273
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:38,708
Sure. I'll clean up the bathroom.

274
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,961
Don't worry, and take care of his funeral.

275
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,421
I'll go after I'm done.

276
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:45,340
Thanks, Jeongmin.

277
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:56,059
Jian.

278
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,856
I brought Jinman's childhood friends.

279
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:17,581
Make sure to remember all of this.
You have to pay them back one day.

280
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,374
The gym at Yecheong Intersection.

281
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,669
The owner is the president
of Yecheong High Alumni Association.

282
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:25,380
This is from Yecheon Middle School
Alumni Association.

283
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,883
Also, this is from Lee Yonghan.

284
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:29,843
COMRADE LEE YONGHAN

285
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:32,262
I don't really know who this is.

286
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:34,514
You have a guest!

287
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,516
- Miss, come here.
- Okay.

288
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,019
I'll take care of things here.

289
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:40,812
Go and greet the guests.

290
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:41,897
Mmm.

291
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:46,526
COMRADE LEE YONGHAN

292
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:49,738
Are you okay?

293
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,656
I'm fine, but...

294
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:10,383
Jeong.

295
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,552
So this is how you go.

296
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,181
I'll see you later in hell.

297
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,485
Do you need anything else?

298
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,154
We have pancakes. Do you want some?

299
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:38,703
So you were colleagues of Jinman, right?

300
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:42,541
All right.

301
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,127
Wow.

302
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:51,967
What a bunch of rude jerks.

303
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,469
They should respond
when someone talks to them.

304
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:57,138
Aren't those twins from the neighborhood?

305
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,474
Come on. I know everyone
in this neighborhood.

306
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:02,310
They're all outsiders.

307
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:54,821
Jinman!

308
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,743
What's with him? Did Jinman
owe him money or something?

309
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:02,203
Or did he date Jinman?

310
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:04,914
He's been crying like that for two days.

311
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,875
That's what I'm saying.

312
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,502
By the way,

313
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:11,212
why did Jinman commit suicide?

314
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:14,633
You know, he was selling
those hoses on the Internet.

315
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:16,718
I think it wasn't going well.

316
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,887
He had a lot of debt.

317
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,765
Money's always the problem.

318
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:24,100
If that was the case,
why didn't you help him?

319
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,227
You run seven greenhouses!

320
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,729
Why should I?

321
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,773
I've never liked Jinman.

322
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:32,776
That's because you got your ass handed
to you by Jinman

323
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,861
when he caught you robbing younger kids.

324
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:36,488
- No, I didn't!
- Yes, you did.

325
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:40,408
Jinman knocked out three of your teeth!
I saw it!

326
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:46,081
Jinman was so popular back then.

327
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,750
Hey! Did you hear?

328
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,836
Before Jinman came back home,

329
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,130
he was the leader of Mokpo's Wasp Gang.

330
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:57,425
What the hell are you talking about?

331
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,135
Jinman was not a gangster.

332
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:00,470
It's true! The Wasp Gang!

333
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:02,931
You don't know anything at all!

334
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:07,727
This is a real secret
that only few people know.

335
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:09,604
There's a rumor...

336
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:15,527
that Jinman was
an anti-North spy for the NIS.

337
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,445
What a load of crock.

338
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:20,240
What you just said
is absolutely ridiculous.

339
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:22,659
He got terrible grades at school!

340
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:24,369
He pretty much got straight F's!

341
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:25,662
F, F, F, F, F!

342
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:28,456
How could he have joined the NIS
with his grades?

343
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,999
Special employment, man!

344
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,502
- The Wasp Gang!
- I'm right!

345
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:34,504
You bastards!

346
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:36,089
You scared me. What the hell?

347
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:37,590
- What?
- What the hell?

348
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:39,551
You little punks!

349
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:42,887
You shouldn't speak like that!

350
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:47,559
Don't you remember who Jinman was to us?

351
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:51,438
Do you remember
when our dads lost all their money

352
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:54,482
to the gambling house
in the neighborhood over?

353
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,484
Why would you bring that up now?

354
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,695
Your dad lost tens of millions of won.

355
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:00,697
My dad lost the deed to the house.

356
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,074
He came home and lit briquettes.

357
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,410
<i>My brother and I almost died!</i>

358
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,746
Back then,

359
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:12,083
I inhaled the smoke and almost died!

360
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:13,877
Back then!

361
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:22,677
Jinman?

362
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,726
<i>It was definitely him.</i>

363
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,356
It was Jinman that left the money?

364
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:39,736
Jinman was the one that saved you all.

365
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,325
Jinman, you bastard.

366
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,668
<i>I lived with him for ten years.</i>

367
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,671
<i>But I know nothing about him.</i>

368
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,091
We'll leave after you're done smoking.

369
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:37,437
Jian.

370
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:41,399
I'll go to the cemetery with you.

371
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:00,209
She didn't cry once at the funeral.

372
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:03,087
Maybe she wasn't that attached to him.

373
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,464
Maybe they weren't close.

374
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:07,508
Oh, stop it. She can hear you.

375
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:12,722
They're unbelievable.

376
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,935
People all mourn in different ways.

377
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,357
Great job, Jian.

378
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,581
I cleaned up the bathroom for you.

379
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:39,707
Okay.

380
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:42,794
Thanks, Jeongmin.

381
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:45,463
It's nothing. I'm glad I could be of help.

382
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,090
We were close as kids.

383
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:50,009
I'm relieved

384
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,096
you're coping better than I thought.

385
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:56,516
Does it look like

386
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:00,144
I'm holding it together to you?

387
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,481
Well...

388
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:05,692
Are you not?

389
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,447
I'm disgusted with my uncle.

390
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:14,117
The way he died.

391
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,711
Sorry. I shouldn't say that.

392
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:27,630
Thanks a lot.

393
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:29,632
Once I pull myself together,

394
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,843
I'll call you. Let's grab a bite to eat.

395
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,138
Sure.

396
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:36,931
Make sure to call, Jian.

397
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:39,058
Bye.

398
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,810
<i>I already ate.</i>

399
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,819
Make yourself something to eat.

400
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:38,696
What was so hard for you?

401
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:44,619
What was so hard for you?

402
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:50,791
You pretended to be so strong.

403
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,800
What am I supposed to do all alone now?

404
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,648
Jian, I forgot to give you...

405
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:15,942
this...

406
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:24,200
Should I come back later?

407
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:33,834
Jeongmin.

408
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,255
Yes?

409
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,840
I'm not doing okay right now.

410
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,055
Can you stay with me for a little while?

411
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:24,510
Thanks again, Jeongmin.

412
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,346
No, don't mention it.

413
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:30,349
I don't have anything to do
at home anyway.

414
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:33,060
I can stay longer.

415
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,228
Okay.

416
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:37,732
Right.

417
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,943
You found this in the bathroom?

418
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:44,613
Yes, I think it was your uncle's.

419
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:46,741
No, it's not.

420
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:50,745
We both got the latest models
when I started college.

421
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,291
Can this even make calls?

422
00:38:57,126 --> 00:39:00,921
Or maybe your uncle used it for work?

423
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:03,007
What, like a burner phone?

424
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:11,223
I DEPOSITED 70 MILLION WON!
WHEN CAN I RECEIVE THE ITEM?

425
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:12,308
Seventy million won?

426
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:17,396
How many hoses did they buy
to deposit that much?

427
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:22,943
BALANCE: 18,753,000,000 WON

428
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:31,911
Jeongmin.

429
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,163
How much is this?

430
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:39,377
Eighteen...

431
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:41,545
18.7 billion won?

432
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:53,808
Do you think you can earn this much
from selling hoses?

433
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:56,602
No.

434
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:06,821
The website that you revamped
for my uncle.

435
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:08,406
Can you show me?

436
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,828
70 million won's worth of these hoses?

437
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,914
It's a little over 11 kilometers.

438
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:19,875
As you said,

439
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:23,629
it doesn't make sense to order
that much money's worth of hoses.

440
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,214
Right.

441
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:29,760
But...

442
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:34,473
if this website was used
as a front for a different website...

443
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:40,146
WE CAN'T FIND THE PAGE

444
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:55,953
This...

445
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,255
YOU HAVE LOGGED IN AUTOMATICALLY

446
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:15,139
- It's the dark web.
- What?

447
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:17,475
An illegal website.

448
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,769
The agricultural goods website
is probably a front.

449
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,689
Like a passageway to this website.

450
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,608
Then, what kind of website is this?

451
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:31,197
There are prices to the weapons here.

452
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:37,244
It looks like a website
that sells weapons.

453
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,121
Weapons?

454
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,461
He sold things like this?

455
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:47,630
My uncle?

456
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:49,548
Yes.

457
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:59,141
I PAID. WHEN WILL YOU SHIP IT?

458
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,828
I AM SORRY. THE SHOP WILL BE CLOSED...

459
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:24,250
I'LL RETURN YOUR MONEY
IF YOU PROVIDE YOUR ACCOUNT NUMBER

460
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:29,505
THEN... IS JEONG JINMAN DEAD?

461
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:34,176
THEN... YOU'LL DIE TODAY TOO, JIAN

462
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:42,268
What a crazy bastard!

463
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:45,020
Jian, don't let this bother you.

464
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:46,355
This person is crazy.

465
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:53,612
Still, just to be safe,

466
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:55,614
shall we call the police?

467
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:17,928
Jinman, it's Minhye.

468
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,311
My uncle isn't home today.

469
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:26,937
Please come back next time.

470
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:30,482
<i>"Uncle"? You must be his niece.</i>

471
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,735
<i>Wow, I heard a lot about you.</i>

472
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:36,905
I'm So Minhye,
Jinman's private Chinese tutor.

473
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:39,033
Anyway, did Jinman go somewhere?

474
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,452
We have a lesson today.

475
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:44,496
<i>I called, but I can't get through to him.</i>

476
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:45,706
As you know,

477
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:49,376
he's not the type to change plans
without calling ahead.

478
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:52,129
My uncle was learning Chinese?

479
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:00,971
DON'T LET ANYONE ELSE KILL YOU

480
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:02,973
I'LL COME AND KILL YOU MYSELF, JIAN.

481
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:11,857
Your front door was open, so I came in.

482
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:15,486
If it's all right with you,

483
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:18,197
can I wait for him inside?

484
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:40,928
A SHOP FOR KILLERS

485
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:42,012
JIAN
7 YEARS OLD

486
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:45,140
-I would've prepared something
had I known you were coming.

487
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:47,893
What's there to prepare?
We'll eat whatever you serve.

488
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:50,896
You come and sit too.

489
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,815
Yes, come and sit.

490
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:55,150
Is it good?

491
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:57,152
Does it taste good?

492
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:59,446
It must be really good.

493
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,573
You shoved all of that down your throat.

494
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:04,368
You sure know how to stuff your face.

495
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:06,245
-Stop that.
- It's good.

496
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:11,291
You know how good our food is.
Why haven't you come by more often?

497
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:13,877
Wait a second. How long has it been?

498
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,421
Mom.

499
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:19,675
- Has it been five or six years?
- Seven years and eight months.

500
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,428
Almost eight years.

501
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,264
My God, little brother.

502
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:27,933
You haven't called or visited us
for eight years?

503
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:30,728
Since I didn't hear from you once,

504
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:34,481
I figured you were on a boat somewhere
and died at sea.

505
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,024
- You know?
-Goodness.

506
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:37,401
Stop that!

507
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,196
Honey, that's enough.

508
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,491
Jinman, do you want more meat?

509
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,659
Yes, please.

510
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:47,494
What happened to your face?

511
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:51,081
- Did you get into a fight?
- No, it's just a scratch.

512
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,500
You should be more careful.

513
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:55,127
My son.

514
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:58,130
- You need to get married.
- Yeah, right!

515
00:45:58,213 --> 00:46:00,007
Look at this bum, Mom!

516
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,800
Women would run away from him!

517
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:04,386
- Damn it.
-Stop it, honey.

518
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:10,267
-Jeong Jian.
-That's my girl.

519
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:21,528
Do you know my name?

520
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:23,071
I don't.

521
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:24,948
Jeong Jinman.

522
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:26,950
It's Jeong Jinman.

523
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:28,035
Remember it.

524
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:31,872
My baby.
