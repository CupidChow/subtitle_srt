1
00:01:31,082 --> 00:01:36,122
(Only For Love)

2
00:01:36,203 --> 00:01:38,962
(Episode 29)

3
00:01:39,918 --> 00:01:41,318
If a girl

4
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,291
used to be very proactive in pursuing a man,

5
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:45,708
but then...

6
00:01:48,148 --> 00:01:49,922
But then, they had some issues.

7
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,101
So, the girl completely stopped contacting him.

8
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:54,379
What could be the reason?

9
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,070
What kind of reason could there be?

10
00:01:57,846 --> 00:01:59,727
Being proactive can be tiring too.

11
00:02:00,167 --> 00:02:01,786
In a relationship,

12
00:02:01,987 --> 00:02:04,292
the man should also take the initiative sometimes.

13
00:02:04,373 --> 00:02:06,693
Shouldn't it be the man's turn to take the initiative now?

14
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:09,575
The man has to take the initiative?

15
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:10,599
Yes.

16
00:02:10,841 --> 00:02:12,336
It was always the girl who took the initiative.

17
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,722
Can't the man take the initiative too?

18
00:02:15,421 --> 00:02:16,861
If there's no contact,

19
00:02:17,245 --> 00:02:19,595
who knows what's on his mind?

20
00:02:20,237 --> 00:02:21,880
Does he even care about me?

21
00:02:32,405 --> 00:02:34,962
Maybe not contacting means she doesn't like me.

22
00:02:35,678 --> 00:02:39,238
She can apologize for work, but not for me.

23
00:02:42,399 --> 00:02:43,682
Uncle.

24
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:45,359
What happened

25
00:02:47,198 --> 00:02:48,879
between you and Shu Yi?

26
00:02:49,631 --> 00:02:51,112
What's going on between you two?

27
00:02:51,773 --> 00:02:53,973
Are you really planning to ignore Shu Yi?

28
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:01,459
Men and women think completely differently.

29
00:03:01,602 --> 00:03:04,682
There may be a misunderstanding between you.

30
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,961
She's a girl.

31
00:03:07,002 --> 00:03:09,722
Sometimes it's precisely because she cares about you and values ​​you,

32
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,161
that's why she doesn't dare to easily reveal her thoughts.

33
00:03:19,914 --> 00:03:22,514
(You should go to the hospital tomorrow to get a rabies vaccine.)

34
00:03:22,841 --> 00:03:24,138
(I don't have class tomorrow afternoon.)

35
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,912
(If you need, I can accompany you.)

36
00:03:30,846 --> 00:03:32,156
Taking the initiative

37
00:03:33,164 --> 00:03:34,514
without making things clear.

38
00:03:35,665 --> 00:03:37,144
What's that supposed to mean?

39
00:03:42,246 --> 00:03:43,246
Uncle.

40
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,120
What do you think is the most important thing in a relationship?

41
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:51,322
How can a relationship last?

42
00:03:52,653 --> 00:03:53,653
Honesty.

43
00:03:54,532 --> 00:03:55,801
Honesty is the foundation.

44
00:03:55,998 --> 00:03:57,267
Treat each other sincerely.

45
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:01,150
If you want the relationship to last, compatibility is crucial.

46
00:04:01,372 --> 00:04:03,921
If two people can't be on the same wavelength,

47
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,800
even in the end, they'll go their separate ways.

48
00:04:07,712 --> 00:04:09,104
Didn't you just say

49
00:04:09,185 --> 00:04:11,905
in a relationship, it can't be only one party taking the initiative.

50
00:04:12,184 --> 00:04:13,254
Thus,

51
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:17,880
in love, one cannot obtain it through unconditional compromise

52
00:04:17,961 --> 00:04:19,800
and sacrificing oneself by either party.

53
00:04:20,362 --> 00:04:22,242
Before pursuing love,

54
00:04:22,364 --> 00:04:24,442
you should know your life goals,

55
00:04:24,727 --> 00:04:28,513
then you'll know what kind of person you want to walk through life with.

56
00:04:33,126 --> 00:04:34,196
Uncle.

57
00:04:35,281 --> 00:04:37,521
Is Shu Yi the one for you?

58
00:04:47,056 --> 00:04:48,247
Go to bed quickly.

59
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,600
Being on the same wavelength?

60
00:05:06,671 --> 00:05:08,671
What does it mean to be on the same wavelength?

61
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:14,151
What are my life goals?

62
00:05:23,203 --> 00:05:24,883
(You haven't been to class recently.)

63
00:05:25,082 --> 00:05:28,792
(I uploaded the lecture notes and class videos to the cloud for you.)

64
00:05:28,873 --> 00:05:30,479
(You can check them when you have time.)

65
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,032
(If there's anything you don't understand, feel free to ask me.)

66
00:05:33,056 --> 00:05:35,322
(If you have time, )

67
00:05:35,743 --> 00:05:37,610
(you can continue attending classes.)

68
00:05:56,886 --> 00:05:59,446
(If two people can't be on the same wavelength, )

69
00:05:59,574 --> 00:06:02,205
(even in the end, they'll go their separate ways.)

70
00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:07,808
(Thank you, Professor Yu.)

71
00:06:07,922 --> 00:06:10,362
(I'll diligently study the content you shared.)

72
00:06:10,981 --> 00:06:13,042
(I can get the shot myself.)

73
00:06:13,154 --> 00:06:14,922
(No need to trouble you, Professor Yu.)

74
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,636
Yu Ling.

75
00:06:47,052 --> 00:06:48,853
With so much material,

76
00:06:49,414 --> 00:06:51,655
this topic must be a hit, right?

77
00:06:52,647 --> 00:06:54,042
Maybe I'm lucky.

78
00:06:54,262 --> 00:06:55,942
Mr. Shi was very cooperative with my work.

79
00:07:06,736 --> 00:07:09,082
(Zheng Shu Yi, are you free this afternoon?)

80
00:07:09,182 --> 00:07:11,862
(Let me introduce a few friends who just returned to China to you.)

81
00:07:51,675 --> 00:07:52,687
(Well-written.)

82
00:07:52,768 --> 00:07:54,962
(It's truly a warm interview.)

83
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,765
(Everyone's answers inside are also what I have in my mind.)

84
00:08:13,948 --> 00:08:16,429
I only participated a little bit in this topic.

85
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:22,359
If one day,

86
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,842
I can independently write such good articles like Shu Yi,

87
00:08:26,954 --> 00:08:28,080
that would be great.

88
00:08:33,002 --> 00:08:35,282
I know what my life goal is now.

89
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,322
Earlier, we discussed the UK and France.

90
00:08:42,415 --> 00:08:44,322
Now, let's take a look at Germany together.

91
00:08:44,512 --> 00:08:47,191
Germany's industrialization started relatively late.

92
00:08:47,512 --> 00:08:51,062
In the 19th century, joint-stock companies were still scarce.

93
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,308
- Thank you. - The capital market...

94
00:08:53,421 --> 00:08:55,962
Mainly served the royal family, government...

95
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:57,297
Long time no see.

96
00:09:00,196 --> 00:09:01,465
And city-states.

97
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:04,082
Thanks for saving a seat for me today.

98
00:09:04,241 --> 00:09:06,322
Otherwise, I might have had to sit on the stairs.

99
00:09:06,784 --> 00:09:09,254
I haven't seen you in class for a long time.

100
00:09:09,687 --> 00:09:12,318
But I always saved this seat for you.

101
00:09:12,629 --> 00:09:14,988
Unexpectedly, you came today. What a coincidence.

102
00:09:15,117 --> 00:09:16,146
Thank you.

103
00:09:17,043 --> 00:09:20,233
I had some family matters these days, so I couldn't come.

104
00:09:20,462 --> 00:09:22,583
But I'll come more frequently in the future.

105
00:09:23,544 --> 00:09:25,745
Then I'll continue saving a seat for you next time.

106
00:09:26,536 --> 00:09:27,856
I'll buy you coffee then.

107
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:28,959
Sure.

108
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,681
We just talked about financial liberalization.

109
00:09:31,824 --> 00:09:34,488
In fact, financial liberalization is also called financial deepening.

110
00:09:34,512 --> 00:09:36,602
It's the counterpart of financial repression.

111
00:09:40,545 --> 00:09:41,545
Thank you.

112
00:09:44,335 --> 00:09:46,339
Enhance domestic fundraising capabilities

113
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,969
to reduce overreliance on foreign investment.

114
00:09:50,585 --> 00:09:52,466
Reduce foreign dependence,

115
00:10:00,168 --> 00:10:03,962
thus promoting an increase in domestic savings rates to curb inflation

116
00:10:04,106 --> 00:10:06,642
and stimulate economic growth.

117
00:10:14,612 --> 00:10:15,931
I'll need your help in the future.

118
00:10:15,955 --> 00:10:17,022
Thank you so much.

119
00:10:18,061 --> 00:10:20,342
Is there anything you didn't understand during the class?

120
00:10:20,991 --> 00:10:21,991
Professor Yu.

121
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:23,486
I have another class next.

122
00:10:23,567 --> 00:10:24,567
I'll leave now.

123
00:10:28,048 --> 00:10:29,442
I have some questions.

124
00:10:30,978 --> 00:10:31,978
Here.

125
00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:33,182
Here.

126
00:10:33,263 --> 00:10:34,294
And here.

127
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:37,793
I've marked everything so that I can ask you after class.

128
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:44,082
These were explained in detail in class.

129
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:46,223
It should be in the classes you missed before.

130
00:10:46,698 --> 00:10:49,362
How about this? Didn't I send you some materials before?

131
00:10:49,474 --> 00:10:52,194
After reading them, if you have any questions, you can ask me again.

132
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:54,785
Sure. Thank you, Professor Yu.

133
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,962
It's getting late.

134
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,103
I don't have classes later.

135
00:11:06,302 --> 00:11:08,622
Why don't we go to the cafeteria and have a meal together?

136
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:12,282
Okay.

137
00:11:20,926 --> 00:11:22,042
Professor Yu.

138
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:25,172
Professor Yu.

139
00:11:25,253 --> 00:11:27,211
Student union would like to invite you

140
00:11:27,292 --> 00:11:30,104
to give a graduation talk to the seniors who are graduating soon

141
00:11:30,184 --> 00:11:31,888
to cheer them up and clear up their doubts.

142
00:11:31,912 --> 00:11:33,322
Do you have time?

143
00:11:33,383 --> 00:11:36,534
I'd like to discuss the specific schedule and general direction with you.

144
00:11:37,012 --> 00:11:39,122
You guys talk first. I'll go now.

145
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:41,885
Professor Yu, is this also your student?

146
00:11:42,623 --> 00:11:43,733
I'm not.

147
00:11:43,825 --> 00:11:46,145
So, you're his girlfriend?

148
00:11:50,105 --> 00:11:52,306
Chen Lei, go back first.

149
00:11:52,387 --> 00:11:54,321
I'll talk to you this afternoon about the details.

150
00:11:54,345 --> 00:11:55,425
Okay, I'll get going now.

151
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,763
Professor Yu, bye.

152
00:12:04,061 --> 00:12:05,345
She just misunderstood us.

153
00:12:05,426 --> 00:12:07,265
Why didn't you explain to her?

154
00:12:08,584 --> 00:12:09,584
Explain what?

155
00:12:10,137 --> 00:12:13,256
Explain that I'm not your

156
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:14,989
that...

157
00:12:16,873 --> 00:12:18,962
What if she spread rumors?

158
00:12:19,951 --> 00:12:21,202
She was joking.

159
00:12:21,447 --> 00:12:23,687
And I don't think there's a need to explain at all.

160
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:26,305
What's that supposed to mean?

161
00:12:28,751 --> 00:12:29,809
By the way,

162
00:12:29,965 --> 00:12:31,522
the door at my house is installed.

163
00:12:36,927 --> 00:12:39,362
I'll see when I have time.

164
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,122
Le'an Technology's team,

165
00:13:13,295 --> 00:13:16,445
equipment and research environment are very professional.

166
00:13:16,776 --> 00:13:19,285
The research precision far exceeds my imagination.

167
00:13:19,972 --> 00:13:21,389
Professor Li,

168
00:13:21,472 --> 00:13:23,528
now that you understand the situation in Le'an Technology,

169
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:24,743
do you have any suggestions?

170
00:13:24,855 --> 00:13:28,445
Also, is there any possibility of cooperation with your laboratory?

171
00:13:31,162 --> 00:13:33,842
My laboratory is affiliated with the university,

172
00:13:34,312 --> 00:13:36,271
and my team members are all students.

173
00:13:36,352 --> 00:13:39,722
Currently, we're focused on cutting-edge academic research.

174
00:13:40,505 --> 00:13:41,882
To be honest,

175
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:45,168
if you want us to solve Le'an's problems in the short term,

176
00:13:45,504 --> 00:13:46,962
it's beyond our capabilities.

177
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,945
I have a suggestion, but I'm not sure if I should say it.

178
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:55,562
Professor Li, please go ahead.

179
00:13:56,088 --> 00:13:57,962
If Le'an collaborates with Black Horse,

180
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,161
then the so-called problem will be easily solved.

181
00:14:00,242 --> 00:14:01,362
How is that possible?

182
00:14:16,492 --> 00:14:18,117
(Zheng Shu Yi, I'd like to invite you)

183
00:14:18,198 --> 00:14:20,894
(to accompany me to EM's charity dinner.)

184
00:14:21,712 --> 00:14:24,073
I heard the shareholders might replace Shi Yan.

185
00:14:24,512 --> 00:14:25,802
So serious?

186
00:14:26,184 --> 00:14:29,384
Isn't Shi Yan in trouble?

187
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,864
He's not worried about that.

188
00:14:30,982 --> 00:14:33,452
He's still attending EM's charity dinner as usual.

189
00:14:39,231 --> 00:14:41,847
(Shu Yi, many people will attend this dinner.)

190
00:14:41,945 --> 00:14:43,602
(It will help you expand your network. )

191
00:14:43,822 --> 00:14:46,503
(Take it as you're there to alleviate my social anxiety.)

192
00:14:48,969 --> 00:14:50,322
(All right.)

193
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,345
(But I might leave early.)

194
00:14:54,306 --> 00:14:55,722
(No problem.)

195
00:14:55,864 --> 00:14:57,664
(I don't want to stay there for long either.)

196
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:20,215
You must've been waiting for a long time.

197
00:15:20,239 --> 00:15:21,239
I just arrived.

198
00:15:21,952 --> 00:15:22,952
Let's go in.

199
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:38,602
(EM's Charity Dinner)

200
00:15:42,614 --> 00:15:43,922
Who are you texting?

201
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,802
Nobody. Here.

202
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:50,958
Yi Yang?

203
00:15:51,622 --> 00:15:53,252
Why is he with Miss Zheng?

204
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:33,329
Shi Yan.

205
00:16:37,356 --> 00:16:39,626
Isn't Bei Lin Shi Yan's ex-girlfriend?

206
00:16:39,893 --> 00:16:41,415
They are still friends after breaking up?

207
00:16:41,439 --> 00:16:42,799
Or are they getting back together?

208
00:16:42,825 --> 00:16:44,371
Yunchuang is facing internal and external issues.

209
00:16:44,395 --> 00:16:47,042
There must be a reason why Shi Yan still attends this dinner.

210
00:16:49,331 --> 00:16:51,491
Shi Yan, long time no see.

211
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,368
Long time no see.

212
00:16:54,974 --> 00:16:57,574
Isn't that the beautiful journalist who was with Shi Yan earlier?

213
00:16:57,664 --> 00:16:59,202
How did she get involved with Yi Yang?

214
00:17:00,045 --> 00:17:02,605
The new romantic interest and old flame appear at the same time.

215
00:17:06,417 --> 00:17:08,282
Shu Yi, are you hungry?

216
00:17:08,456 --> 00:17:09,646
Let's go have some snacks.

217
00:17:17,623 --> 00:17:18,654
Do you know them?

218
00:17:22,145 --> 00:17:24,002
Why? Is it not to your liking?

219
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:39,162
Come with me.

220
00:17:44,801 --> 00:17:48,430
I kind of understand what you wanted to do back then.

221
00:18:04,609 --> 00:18:05,962
You drank too fast.

222
00:18:08,984 --> 00:18:10,402
Didn't you say that

223
00:18:11,062 --> 00:18:12,423
it'd be a big loss

224
00:18:12,605 --> 00:18:14,964
if I don't eat and drink well during the dinner?

225
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:19,798
You're right.

226
00:18:20,943 --> 00:18:22,293
I'll drink with you.

227
00:18:34,784 --> 00:18:35,784
Shu Yi,

228
00:18:36,623 --> 00:18:37,623
honestly,

229
00:18:39,944 --> 00:18:41,173
what do you think of me?

230
00:18:44,048 --> 00:18:45,562
Do you not believe that

231
00:18:46,064 --> 00:18:47,743
I can be a good

232
00:18:48,423 --> 00:18:49,762
exemplary boyfriend?

233
00:18:51,744 --> 00:18:52,973
I believe that.

234
00:18:54,006 --> 00:18:56,046
- Then... - No matter what kind of person you are

235
00:18:56,423 --> 00:18:57,922
and how good you are,

236
00:18:58,574 --> 00:19:00,053
it has nothing to do with me.

237
00:19:02,158 --> 00:19:03,962
I have someone I like.

238
00:19:04,496 --> 00:19:05,765
I like him,

239
00:19:05,943 --> 00:19:07,922
and he's the only one I can see

240
00:19:08,312 --> 00:19:09,422
and care about.

241
00:19:12,423 --> 00:19:13,493
I regret it.

242
00:19:16,944 --> 00:19:18,253
Can we

243
00:19:18,984 --> 00:19:20,624
give each other another chance?

244
00:19:24,175 --> 00:19:25,175
No.

245
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,839
When it comes to relationships, once it's missed, it's missed.

246
00:19:28,863 --> 00:19:30,134
Are you taking revenge on me?

247
00:19:30,248 --> 00:19:32,878
I won't use my relationships for revenge or sacrifice.

248
00:19:34,752 --> 00:19:37,522
Sorry, that was not what I meant.

249
00:19:38,423 --> 00:19:41,424
But you still don't have a girlfriend, do you?

250
00:19:42,072 --> 00:19:43,349
In my heart, I do.

251
00:19:43,462 --> 00:19:44,902
But you've already broken up.

252
00:19:46,841 --> 00:19:49,401
But I never said I wanted to break up with her.

253
00:20:00,145 --> 00:20:03,056
If you like him so much, why don't you be with him?

254
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:07,138
This is my problem.

255
00:20:15,194 --> 00:20:17,034
Is that the girl you were looking at just now?

256
00:20:18,903 --> 00:20:21,094
You care a lot about her being with someone else.

257
00:20:21,616 --> 00:20:24,578
After she left, you became restless.

258
00:20:26,744 --> 00:20:27,773
Shi Yan.

259
00:20:28,623 --> 00:20:29,922
You've really changed.

260
00:20:31,143 --> 00:20:32,143
Bei Lin.

261
00:20:32,663 --> 00:20:34,783
Thank you for saying this to me today,

262
00:20:34,917 --> 00:20:37,077
but I think we should both move on.

263
00:20:37,846 --> 00:20:40,075
Now, I need to leave.

264
00:20:55,426 --> 00:20:57,042
I don't want to see him.

265
00:20:57,625 --> 00:21:00,131
I want to climb up and see more scenery.

266
00:21:00,212 --> 00:21:01,442
Zheng Shu Yi!

267
00:21:09,584 --> 00:21:10,722
Shi Yan?

268
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,351
Zheng Shu Yi, come down.

269
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:17,094
Don't keep showing up in front of me.

270
00:21:17,406 --> 00:21:18,806
I don't want to see you.

271
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:20,863
Shu Yi, be careful.

272
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,122
Ignore him.

273
00:21:22,301 --> 00:21:24,141
Zheng Shu Yi, come down quickly!

274
00:21:28,414 --> 00:21:29,802
I won't go down.

275
00:21:30,025 --> 00:21:32,242
I have to come down if you want me to come down?

276
00:21:32,365 --> 00:21:34,842
You're so fierce. And you ignored me.

277
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:36,243
I don't want you.

278
00:21:38,614 --> 00:21:39,614
Shu Yi.

279
00:21:39,695 --> 00:21:41,414
Be a good girl, come down.

280
00:21:42,005 --> 00:21:43,322
I won't come down

281
00:21:43,876 --> 00:21:45,186
unless you pamper me.

282
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:52,922
Fairy.

283
00:21:53,639 --> 00:21:55,719
Come on, come down slowly.

284
00:21:55,942 --> 00:21:58,182
- Come to me, okay? - Zheng Shu Yi!

285
00:22:02,129 --> 00:22:03,399
Little fairy.

286
00:22:22,629 --> 00:22:24,110
Shi Yan.

287
00:22:24,753 --> 00:22:27,202
You uh-huh weirdo.

288
00:22:27,522 --> 00:22:30,042
You blocked me on WeChat.

289
00:22:30,607 --> 00:22:32,368
I hate you.

290
00:22:32,905 --> 00:22:35,225
I hate you ignoring me.

291
00:22:36,143 --> 00:22:38,983
I hate your cruel heart.

292
00:22:40,101 --> 00:22:41,290
I'll bite you.

293
00:22:50,098 --> 00:22:52,387
Shi Yan, put her down.

294
00:22:52,505 --> 00:22:54,122
You're taking advantage of her.

295
00:22:54,245 --> 00:22:56,526
If you can't give her what she wants, stay away from her.

296
00:22:58,665 --> 00:23:00,442
No matter what Zheng Shu Yi wants,

297
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:02,322
I'll give her everything if I have it.

298
00:23:02,509 --> 00:23:04,869
Even if I don't have it, I'll find a way to give it to her.

299
00:23:04,903 --> 00:23:06,682
But no matter what she wants,

300
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:08,798
she can only get it from me.

301
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:02,159
Don't go.

302
00:24:05,117 --> 00:24:06,467
Shi Yan.

303
00:24:08,272 --> 00:24:10,751
I won't let you go.

304
00:24:11,856 --> 00:24:14,496
I miss you.

305
00:24:22,448 --> 00:24:23,848
Shi Yan.

306
00:24:26,438 --> 00:24:27,879
Shi Yan.

307
00:24:29,645 --> 00:24:31,326
Shi Yan.

308
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:34,522
I'm here.

309
00:24:46,646 --> 00:24:48,287
You're not here.

310
00:24:49,625 --> 00:24:52,105
All of them can see you.

311
00:24:53,224 --> 00:24:55,423
But I can't see you.

312
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,360
I want to see you too.

313
00:25:07,863 --> 00:25:09,743
Then answer me a question first.

314
00:25:12,504 --> 00:25:13,762
Zheng Shu Yi,

315
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,442
do you

316
00:25:17,906 --> 00:25:19,722
ever have feelings for me?

317
00:27:31,767 --> 00:27:33,962
(Good morning. Have you sobered up?)

318
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:45,762
(What happened last night?)

319
00:27:50,918 --> 00:27:52,678
(Who sent me home?)

320
00:27:59,785 --> 00:28:02,362
(I'm awake. Thank you for your concern.)

321
00:28:15,749 --> 00:28:17,109
Zheng Shu Yi.

322
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,700
What are you daydreaming about?

323
00:28:21,577 --> 00:28:23,377
How could it possibly be Shi Yan?

324
00:29:23,296 --> 00:29:26,747
(Shu Yi, do you have any recommendations for news-related books?)

325
00:29:26,828 --> 00:29:28,829
(I want to read up during the holiday.)

326
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,390
(Not bad, Yue.)

327
00:29:31,471 --> 00:29:33,511
(You're actively learning. This is great progress.)

328
00:29:33,736 --> 00:29:35,576
(I'll compile a book list for you later.)

329
00:29:40,183 --> 00:29:41,320
- Have some fruits. - Fruits?

330
00:29:41,344 --> 00:29:44,002
Shu Yi, these are the fruits bought by Mr. Yi from Dark Horse.

331
00:29:44,097 --> 00:29:45,738
This bag is specifically for you.

332
00:29:46,423 --> 00:29:47,423
Mr. Yi?

333
00:29:47,928 --> 00:29:49,448
- You two... - No.

334
00:29:49,606 --> 00:29:51,245
No, don't talk nonsense.

335
00:29:52,473 --> 00:29:53,583
Thank you, You Ran.

336
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,880
Please help me share these with everyone.

337
00:29:56,038 --> 00:29:57,517
Okay, thank you, Shu Yi.

338
00:30:06,574 --> 00:30:10,454
(Mr. Yi is taking another wave of moves to pursue Shu Yi!)

339
00:30:20,225 --> 00:30:23,624
I never noticed before that she's so good at this.

340
00:30:27,882 --> 00:30:29,638
Shu Yi, there's an express delivery for you.

341
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:32,282
Thank you. Please bring it over for me.

342
00:30:32,537 --> 00:30:35,347
Shu Yi, it's too big. I can't bring it over.

343
00:30:45,105 --> 00:30:47,105
(I hope I can skateboard with you.)

344
00:30:56,401 --> 00:30:57,471
(No need.)

345
00:30:57,683 --> 00:30:59,442
(I'll return the thing to you.)

346
00:31:03,197 --> 00:31:05,116
(What's wrong? You don't like it?)

347
00:31:05,546 --> 00:31:07,882
(What can I do to make you happy?)

348
00:31:08,996 --> 00:31:11,956
(Can you tell me what happened on the night of the dinner?)

349
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:14,831
(If you want to know, )

350
00:31:14,912 --> 00:31:17,632
(come meet me at the City Square after work the day after tomorrow.)

351
00:31:17,665 --> 00:31:18,705
(Bring your skateboard.)

352
00:31:20,607 --> 00:31:22,367
(I don't want to know now.)

353
00:31:24,804 --> 00:31:25,842
(It's up to you.)

354
00:31:25,932 --> 00:31:28,042
(Anyway, I'll be waiting for you there.)

355
00:31:32,367 --> 00:31:34,168
Shu Yi, come here.

356
00:32:03,385 --> 00:32:05,362
Why? Is there anything else?

357
00:32:05,755 --> 00:32:06,755
Yes.

358
00:32:07,104 --> 00:32:08,104
Go ahead.

359
00:32:08,246 --> 00:32:10,202
Mr. Yi has been pursuing Miss Zheng recently.

360
00:32:11,544 --> 00:32:15,263
I heard he sent something to Financial Introduce for Miss Zheng today.

361
00:32:30,104 --> 00:32:31,482
You can leave now.

362
00:32:32,623 --> 00:32:33,623
Okay.

363
00:32:56,623 --> 00:32:58,402
Yu Ling, Ms. Yi wants to see you.

364
00:33:03,276 --> 00:33:04,384
Ms. Yi.

365
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:08,078
Yu Ling, you conducted interviews at Yunchuang so many times,

366
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,560
and every time you said you brought back useful materials.

367
00:33:10,695 --> 00:33:13,175
Why is this feature article so empty?

368
00:33:14,184 --> 00:33:15,282
Where are the points?

369
00:33:15,366 --> 00:33:16,807
What's your point of view?

370
00:33:21,495 --> 00:33:22,682
Rewrite it.

371
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,282
If you submit articles of this quality again,

372
00:33:25,463 --> 00:33:26,983
I'll get someone else to do it.

373
00:33:27,623 --> 00:33:28,694
Noted, Ms. Yi.

374
00:33:30,561 --> 00:33:33,170
- What did Ms. Yi say to you? - Nothing much.

375
00:33:33,259 --> 00:33:35,979
We just talked about the overseas returnee entrepreneurship feature.

376
00:33:36,453 --> 00:33:38,894
Then, what do you think Ms. Yi wants to say to Xu Yu Ling?

377
00:33:39,663 --> 00:33:41,503
Don't know, don't care.

378
00:33:47,154 --> 00:33:49,094
If you can't let go of the feature about Yunchuang, just say it.

379
00:33:49,118 --> 00:33:50,598
Why did you say bad things about me?

380
00:33:52,022 --> 00:33:53,152
What's that supposed to mean?

381
00:33:53,176 --> 00:33:54,407
First is Shi Yan.

382
00:33:54,488 --> 00:33:55,838
Then there's Yi Yang.

383
00:33:55,984 --> 00:33:57,704
No wonder your articles passed so smoothly.

384
00:33:57,785 --> 00:34:00,665
You got Yunchuang and the overseas returnee entrepreneurship features.

385
00:34:00,746 --> 00:34:02,466
You're wasting your talent as a journalist.

386
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:05,202
Xu Yu Ling, can you stop making baseless claims?

387
00:34:05,344 --> 00:34:07,780
Shu Yi has a unique perspective and sharp writing style.

388
00:34:07,861 --> 00:34:09,062
All her articles were a hit.

389
00:34:09,143 --> 00:34:10,880
Will she need to smear you behind your back?

390
00:34:10,904 --> 00:34:13,214
It happened not only once but twice.

391
00:34:13,769 --> 00:34:15,488
What a unique perspective.

392
00:34:15,823 --> 00:34:18,384
You only see the interviewees, right?

393
00:34:18,654 --> 00:34:19,884
Xu Yu Ling.

394
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,350
I won't admit to things I haven't done.

395
00:34:22,545 --> 00:34:25,306
Not to mention how busy I am and how many articles I haven't written.

396
00:34:25,464 --> 00:34:28,703
Do you think, with Ms. Yi's experience and expertise,

397
00:34:28,783 --> 00:34:31,264
she can't see how your articles are compiled?

398
00:34:32,864 --> 00:34:34,562
What's the point of being all talk?

399
00:34:34,713 --> 00:34:37,144
I hope you won't be kicked out of your next feature.

400
00:34:44,701 --> 00:34:45,892
Don't listen to her nonsense.

401
00:34:46,021 --> 00:34:47,740
She hasn't interviewed Shi Yan at all.

402
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:55,870
Come.

403
00:34:56,631 --> 00:34:57,782
Eat more meat.

404
00:35:01,263 --> 00:35:02,784
Okay, okay, that's enough.

405
00:35:02,895 --> 00:35:05,215
If I eat this much, how can I look good on camera?

406
00:35:06,321 --> 00:35:07,922
Don't complain about too much meat.

407
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,599
After eating, we can work out together tonight.

408
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,510
After exercising, we can go home together.

409
00:35:15,175 --> 00:35:17,216
So, that's your plan.

410
00:35:18,937 --> 00:35:20,402
Working out is fine.

411
00:35:20,566 --> 00:35:22,525
But today, you should go back to your home.

412
00:35:28,945 --> 00:35:29,945
Shan Shan.

413
00:35:34,663 --> 00:35:36,264
Distance adds beauty.

414
00:35:45,984 --> 00:35:48,254
(Shan Shan, are you free tonight?)

415
00:35:48,343 --> 00:35:49,653
Tonight?

416
00:35:51,961 --> 00:35:53,802
I'm free tonight.

417
00:35:53,864 --> 00:35:55,463
Let's eat crayfish.

418
00:36:15,261 --> 00:36:16,482
Shan Shan.

419
00:36:16,944 --> 00:36:18,663
Are you really free today?

420
00:36:22,464 --> 00:36:25,522
I heard that Little Dark Horse is chasing you recently. Is it true?

421
00:36:25,681 --> 00:36:27,322
How come even you know about this?

422
00:36:27,944 --> 00:36:30,503
Think about it, he directly pursued you to Financial Introduce.

423
00:36:30,584 --> 00:36:32,024
It's hard not to know.

424
00:36:33,864 --> 00:36:35,744
Bad news travels fast.

425
00:36:36,798 --> 00:36:38,638
How can you say it's bad news?

426
00:36:38,851 --> 00:36:39,882
How is it?

427
00:36:40,104 --> 00:36:41,824
Do you feel anything for Little Dark Horse?

428
00:36:43,361 --> 00:36:45,400
I just broke up with Shi Yan.

429
00:36:46,038 --> 00:36:47,217
You said it too.

430
00:36:47,298 --> 00:36:49,819
You two broke up and he never came to see you, right?

431
00:36:50,265 --> 00:36:52,495
You must be able to love and let go.

432
00:36:53,368 --> 00:36:57,117
In my opinion, Yi Yang is pretty good.

433
00:36:57,279 --> 00:36:59,720
He's young, enthusiastic and proactive.

434
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,362
Being with him might give you more security.

435
00:37:02,545 --> 00:37:05,025
You can't hang yourself on the tree of Shi Yan forever, right?

436
00:37:06,584 --> 00:37:07,613
Tree?

437
00:37:10,462 --> 00:37:11,462
What's wrong?

438
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:14,973
I drank too much on the night of the dinner.

439
00:37:15,295 --> 00:37:17,122
I don't remember who sent me home.

440
00:37:19,371 --> 00:37:21,442
Do you think it was Shi Yan who sent you home?

441
00:37:23,285 --> 00:37:25,326
Maybe it was just my imagination.

442
00:37:25,487 --> 00:37:28,327
Because he should be with Bei Lin at that time.

443
00:37:30,263 --> 00:37:33,482
But I seemed to have smelled his scent again.

444
00:37:34,855 --> 00:37:36,855
So what if it's him?

445
00:37:37,495 --> 00:37:39,242
Did he come to see you afterwards?

446
00:37:39,528 --> 00:37:41,768
There's a good choice right in front of you.

447
00:37:41,888 --> 00:37:43,754
You should seriously consider it.

448
00:37:43,835 --> 00:37:46,155
Yi Yang is young and promising.

449
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:47,750
He's not inferior to Shi Yan, right?

450
00:37:48,936 --> 00:37:50,776
Feelings aren't a multiple-choice question.

451
00:37:50,888 --> 00:37:53,168
I really don't have that kind of feeling for Yi Yang.

452
00:37:56,034 --> 00:37:57,034
Fine.

453
00:37:57,819 --> 00:37:59,602
If you don't like him, forget it.

454
00:38:00,375 --> 00:38:01,895
Since your love life isn't going well,

455
00:38:01,929 --> 00:38:03,808
quickly make progress in your career.

456
00:38:03,904 --> 00:38:06,463
Don't you still need to work on your digital magazine?

457
00:38:08,064 --> 00:38:09,864
I won't affect my work.

458
00:38:17,833 --> 00:38:20,592
Is there an urgent matter? Why don't you answer it?

459
00:38:26,425 --> 00:38:27,562
What's wrong?

460
00:38:27,668 --> 00:38:29,428
(Why didn't you reply to my WeChat message?)

461
00:38:30,343 --> 00:38:32,276
I did reply, didn't I?

462
00:38:32,904 --> 00:38:34,682
(Replying with stickers doesn't count.)

463
00:38:37,439 --> 00:38:38,998
Wait for me a moment.

464
00:38:40,374 --> 00:38:41,442
(Miss you.)

465
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:23,630
Where should we go next? I see many people recommend this place.

466
00:39:23,654 --> 00:39:24,842
Let's check it out.

467
00:39:50,544 --> 00:39:51,722
All right.

468
00:39:53,636 --> 00:39:54,777
You've had enough.

469
00:39:54,908 --> 00:39:56,748
If you want to drink, let's drink another day.

470
00:39:59,265 --> 00:40:00,414
Are you in a hurry to leave?

471
00:40:00,984 --> 00:40:03,493
Brother, look at the time now.

472
00:40:05,424 --> 00:40:07,143
Isn't the bar your second home?

473
00:40:07,866 --> 00:40:10,682
I still have a first home, a third home and a fourth home.

474
00:40:10,823 --> 00:40:12,223
I have to take care of all of them.

475
00:40:14,725 --> 00:40:15,802
I...

476
00:40:16,361 --> 00:40:18,040
I'm in love, okay?

477
00:40:26,807 --> 00:40:29,887
To be honest, everything you're going through now,

478
00:40:29,968 --> 00:40:31,278
I've been through it all before.

479
00:40:32,343 --> 00:40:35,944
I struggled and suffered, just like you.

480
00:40:36,343 --> 00:40:39,493
But the hardest thing for humans to resist is our hearts.

481
00:40:39,972 --> 00:40:42,162
So, I chose to take that first step.

482
00:40:42,545 --> 00:40:43,922
Look at me now.

483
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:46,500
I feel like I'm the happiest person in the world every day.

484
00:40:47,622 --> 00:40:48,622
Trust me.

485
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:50,013
Go straight to her.

486
00:40:50,094 --> 00:40:52,124
Make things clear and ask for an answer.

487
00:40:56,269 --> 00:40:57,870
She never contacted me again.

488
00:40:59,536 --> 00:41:00,886
That's already an answer.

489
00:41:01,598 --> 00:41:02,598
This...

490
00:41:09,024 --> 00:41:10,282
Hello, baby.

491
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:11,842
(Where are you?)

492
00:41:12,495 --> 00:41:14,815
I'm having a drink with Shi Yan.

493
00:41:14,945 --> 00:41:17,473
(I didn't drink, I'm just keeping him company. We'll leave soon.)

494
00:41:17,497 --> 00:41:18,807
Shi Yan?

495
00:41:20,247 --> 00:41:22,007
Are you with Shi Yan?

496
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,188
Yes.

497
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:26,078
Don't believe me? I'll send you a picture.

498
00:41:26,465 --> 00:41:28,944
He's suffering from a broken heart and is drinking alone.

499
00:41:29,143 --> 00:41:30,799
I have to stay with him. You know how it is.

500
00:41:30,823 --> 00:41:32,384
He has a broken heart?

501
00:41:32,465 --> 00:41:34,944
(Shu Yi is the one truly heartbroken, okay?)

502
00:41:35,287 --> 00:41:36,887
(Her face has even gotten thinner.)

503
00:41:37,529 --> 00:41:38,922
(Shi Yan is next to you, right?)

504
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,040
(Then ask him how long he wants to torture Shu Yi.)

505
00:41:42,183 --> 00:41:45,722
Was it him or Yi Yang who took Shu Yi home that night?

506
00:41:46,022 --> 00:41:48,742
(If he did it but he didn't admit it, what's that supposed to mean?)

507
00:41:50,134 --> 00:41:52,934
Then, Miss Zheng has nothing going on with Yi Yang, right?

508
00:41:55,209 --> 00:41:57,269
I hope she has something going on with Yi Yang.

509
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,321
She has no feelings for Yi Yang at all.

510
00:42:00,402 --> 00:42:03,080
(She said she doesn't want to think about relationships anymore lately.)

511
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:04,504
(She wants to focus on her career.)

512
00:42:05,086 --> 00:42:07,966
I don't think she'll recover from this for at least three to five years.

513
00:42:19,825 --> 00:42:21,297
Hey, I have to hang up now.

514
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:23,884
Shi Yan won't say anything. It's driving me crazy.

515
00:42:24,314 --> 00:42:25,482
Baby, I miss you.

516
00:42:25,653 --> 00:42:26,842
(See you tomorrow.)

517
00:42:40,054 --> 00:42:41,414
What on earth are you thinking?

518
00:42:41,607 --> 00:42:44,768
I've never seen you like this before.

519
00:42:50,944 --> 00:42:52,013
I don't know.
