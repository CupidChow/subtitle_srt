1
00:01:31,482 --> 00:01:36,042
(Only For Love)

2
00:01:36,123 --> 00:01:39,282
(Episode 8)

3
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:42,429
Let's have a grand welcome.

4
00:01:52,421 --> 00:01:55,291
Thank you for your valuable time and listening attentively.

5
00:01:55,455 --> 00:01:57,416
In the future, Guan Capital will continue to steadfastly

6
00:01:57,496 --> 00:02:00,006
commit to innovation and talent recruitment.

7
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:03,648
This year, we have also brought new vitality and energy to the company.

8
00:02:03,834 --> 00:02:04,834
Now,

9
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,419
let's welcome Guan Capital's new partner,

10
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:09,779
the strategic consultant,

11
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,141
Professor Yu You, to come on stage.

12
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,111
Hi everyone, I'm Yu You.

13
00:02:29,388 --> 00:02:31,486
I'm very honored to be able to join Guan Capital

14
00:02:31,576 --> 00:02:33,566
and witness its breakthrough growth.

15
00:02:37,874 --> 00:02:40,002
Birds of a feather flock together.

16
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,682
Excellent men often appear in groups.

17
00:02:43,516 --> 00:02:47,482
Yu You looks handsome, young, and outstanding.

18
00:02:50,455 --> 00:02:52,602
What if he is compared to Guan Ji?

19
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,138
That's hard to compare.

20
00:02:55,376 --> 00:02:56,722
What do you think?

21
00:02:56,895 --> 00:02:58,886
What do you think of the two of them compared to Shi Yan?

22
00:03:00,772 --> 00:03:06,755
Shi Yan is like an unreasonable and annoying little elf.

23
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:10,702
In this context, no one can beat him.

24
00:03:33,495 --> 00:03:35,405
(Why do I feel cold?)

25
00:03:38,655 --> 00:03:41,002
Guan Capital is making big progress.

26
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:42,296
Yeah.

27
00:03:44,595 --> 00:03:46,584
He is from our strategy department.

28
00:03:46,703 --> 00:03:47,802
Nice to meet you.

29
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,522
We all rely on you guys.

30
00:03:54,016 --> 00:03:56,122
I'm sorry. Excuse me for a moment.

31
00:03:57,775 --> 00:03:59,616
Hello, Miss Zheng, here we meet again.

32
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,820
Hello.

33
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,602
Our meet-up this time was quite a twist.

34
00:04:05,016 --> 00:04:06,362
Let's hear it.

35
00:04:06,584 --> 00:04:08,052
It's a bit embarrassing to say.

36
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:09,667
There was a small incident.

37
00:04:09,775 --> 00:04:11,726
The invitation letter you gave me got lost.

38
00:04:11,896 --> 00:04:13,995
My colleague later helped me get another one.

39
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,107
So, that's it.

40
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,859
Actually, you should have contacted me again.

41
00:04:17,655 --> 00:04:18,715
Oh yeah.

42
00:04:19,016 --> 00:04:20,482
Do you need a solo interview?

43
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,562
When he's done with his work, maybe I can help.

44
00:04:22,969 --> 00:04:25,562
Thanks. My colleague has already interviewed him last week.

45
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,980
Shu Yi.

46
00:04:29,157 --> 00:04:30,517
This is my good friend.

47
00:04:30,598 --> 00:04:32,378
A journalist from Sanjiang Interactive Entertainment Net,

48
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:33,473
Bi Ruo Shan.

49
00:04:33,555 --> 00:04:35,042
- Hello.   - Hello, Professor Yu You.

50
00:04:35,153 --> 00:04:37,274
- I've heard a lot about you.   - I'm flattered.

51
00:04:37,438 --> 00:04:40,939
Let me introduce you guys to my two friends.

52
00:04:42,576 --> 00:04:44,762
What a coincidence, one of them just left.

53
00:04:50,655 --> 00:04:53,086
(Could he be...)

54
00:04:53,396 --> 00:04:54,456
Guan Ji.

55
00:04:55,016 --> 00:04:56,236
Excuse me.

56
00:04:59,128 --> 00:05:01,762
This one here is the one I mentioned before.

57
00:05:01,864 --> 00:05:04,362
Zheng Shu Yi, a journalist from Financial Introduce.

58
00:05:04,775 --> 00:05:06,325
Nice to meet you, Miss Zheng.

59
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,802
And this beautiful lady is?

60
00:05:11,076 --> 00:05:13,242
Bi Ruo Shan from Sanjiang Interactive Entertainment Net.

61
00:05:15,016 --> 00:05:17,162
The threshold for journalists is really high now.

62
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:19,350
Mr. Guan.

63
00:05:19,431 --> 00:05:22,042
Can you give us an exclusive interview opportunity?

64
00:05:23,193 --> 00:05:24,732
I'll tell everything.

65
00:05:40,608 --> 00:05:41,813
That's how Guan Ji is.

66
00:05:41,894 --> 00:05:44,522
He talks a lot when he sees a beautiful lady.

67
00:05:44,816 --> 00:05:46,080
Shan Shan is like this too.

68
00:05:46,185 --> 00:05:48,282
She talks a lot when she sees a handsome guy.

69
00:05:52,535 --> 00:05:54,316
Excuse me. I have to pick up a call.

70
00:05:56,655 --> 00:05:57,835
Hi, Mom.

71
00:06:00,677 --> 00:06:02,082
Didn't I tell you?

72
00:06:02,168 --> 00:06:04,562
I just got back. I want to settle down first.

73
00:06:06,775 --> 00:06:09,486
Okay. I'll do as you say, all right?

74
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,082
Okay, I'm busy now. Bye.

75
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,937
We really have a lot in common.

76
00:06:17,018 --> 00:06:18,123
That time when I went to see you,

77
00:06:18,204 --> 00:06:20,519
my mom said she'll introduce her colleague's son to me.

78
00:06:21,696 --> 00:06:25,322
My mom just said she'll introduce her old friend's daughter to me.

79
00:06:26,685 --> 00:06:29,802
Professor Yu You, you need to go early to prepare for the dinner tonight.

80
00:06:29,962 --> 00:06:31,423
Okay, thank you.

81
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,412
- I'll leave first.   - Go and do your work.

82
00:06:34,493 --> 00:06:36,498
We'll make an appointment for the next interview.

83
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:37,579
Okay.

84
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:58,682
Do you want to stay for the dinner?

85
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,162
No, thanks. I have to go back to write my article.

86
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,882
(I'm very honored to be able to join Guan Capital)

87
00:07:19,963 --> 00:07:22,242
(and witness its breakthrough growth.)

88
00:07:34,327 --> 00:07:37,282
He has a really nice voice.

89
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,402
Gentle and magnetic.

90
00:07:39,654 --> 00:07:42,685
I just don't know if he looks good or not.

91
00:07:53,858 --> 00:07:57,202
(Has he overheard my complaints about him?)

92
00:08:07,585 --> 00:08:10,402
He never replies to my serious messages.

93
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,962
Then, I can only send him something not so serious.

94
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,224
(I received a mail today.)

95
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,271
("It's my honor to meet you.")

96
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:29,494
(I read a book today.)

97
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,082
(It's called "Meeting You, And I'm Willing to Surrender".)

98
00:08:35,775 --> 00:08:37,155
Oh, not with this.

99
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,150
Come on, let's have a drink.

100
00:08:46,136 --> 00:08:47,555
Congrats!

101
00:08:53,136 --> 00:08:54,722
This side, please.

102
00:08:55,055 --> 00:08:56,356
Thank you.

103
00:09:00,815 --> 00:09:02,402
It's just a small favor.

104
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,802
It's a success because you and Bruce get along well.

105
00:09:04,976 --> 00:09:07,376
Your plans and challenges moved him.

106
00:09:07,518 --> 00:09:09,122
That's why he stayed in Le'an.

107
00:09:15,529 --> 00:09:18,119
(I received a mail today.)

108
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,789
("It's my honor to meet you.")

109
00:09:22,976 --> 00:09:25,525
(I read a book today.)

110
00:09:26,277 --> 00:09:29,842
(It's called "Meeting You, And I'm Willing to Surrender".)

111
00:09:34,935 --> 00:09:36,195
What are you laughing at?

112
00:09:36,935 --> 00:09:38,926
You've been so unusual lately.

113
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,642
I haven't even asked you yet.

114
00:09:40,723 --> 00:09:44,282
Why did you run away during the afternoon press conference?

115
00:09:46,096 --> 00:09:48,682
Maybe I was being unreasonable.

116
00:09:56,008 --> 00:09:57,282
Anyway, you don't read.

117
00:09:57,365 --> 00:09:59,075
So, it doesn't matter what I say.

118
00:10:02,093 --> 00:10:04,972
(Tell me. Why didn't you reply to my text?)

119
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,464
(Is it because your phone is out of credit?)

120
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,122
(Or, are you busy with a multi-billion dollar project?)

121
00:10:20,216 --> 00:10:21,882
I can't blame you for not replying

122
00:10:22,175 --> 00:10:24,284
since you're an illiterate who can't type.

123
00:10:31,815 --> 00:10:32,996
Illiterate?

124
00:10:33,575 --> 00:10:35,645
Can an illiterate read texts?

125
00:10:37,736 --> 00:10:39,095
I haven't had the chance to ask you yet.

126
00:10:39,193 --> 00:10:41,362
Has the media friend you invited come?

127
00:10:42,001 --> 00:10:44,642
Yes. Wasn't I just introducing her to you this afternoon?

128
00:10:44,903 --> 00:10:47,539
She's Miss Zheng Shu Yi.

129
00:10:48,653 --> 00:10:51,122
She's not your soul mate, is she?

130
00:10:57,175 --> 00:10:58,519
We are just friends.

131
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,110
We just get along well.

132
00:11:20,824 --> 00:11:22,202
Professor Yu.

133
00:11:22,543 --> 00:11:23,922
Yes.

134
00:11:53,985 --> 00:11:56,242
(Doesn't an unreasonable person act like this?)

135
00:11:59,695 --> 00:12:00,922
Doomed.

136
00:12:01,376 --> 00:12:02,836
It's him.

137
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,722
He heard it all.

138
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,306
What are you looking at?

139
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,082
I'm looking...

140
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:02,562
I'm looking at you. Mr. Guan, you look different today.

141
00:13:03,642 --> 00:13:05,882
You are so different at work.

142
00:13:11,136 --> 00:13:12,846
You are also different today.

143
00:13:14,295 --> 00:13:15,682
A different kind of beauty.

144
00:13:18,816 --> 00:13:21,162
Mr. Guan, you sure know how to talk.

145
00:13:23,935 --> 00:13:26,722
Only when facing the most beautiful journalist in the city,

146
00:13:27,638 --> 00:13:29,602
I can say such sincere words.

147
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:38,722
Today isn't enough fun.

148
00:13:39,749 --> 00:13:41,010
Let's go for a drink.

149
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,500
Okay.

150
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:57,795
This is the place.

151
00:14:01,256 --> 00:14:03,882
- Do you still remember?   - Of course.

152
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,859
I knew right away. We are the same kind.

153
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:32,642
Hello, beauty.

154
00:14:33,336 --> 00:14:34,395
Alone?

155
00:14:34,616 --> 00:14:36,282
Let's have a drink together.

156
00:14:36,485 --> 00:14:37,505
My treat.

157
00:14:38,695 --> 00:14:40,482
You want to buy me a drink?

158
00:14:41,894 --> 00:14:43,494
I don't drink regular drinks.

159
00:14:43,575 --> 00:14:46,095
This bottle is my special collection.

160
00:14:46,307 --> 00:14:48,642
There are only a few bottles in the world.

161
00:14:49,553 --> 00:14:51,012
Ordinary people

162
00:14:52,216 --> 00:14:53,846
can't drink it.

163
00:15:01,093 --> 00:15:02,193
Hello.

164
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,813
Can you get me a bottle of that wine?

165
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:09,399
- Hello, please wait for awhile.   - Excuse me.

166
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,235
I want to ask the price of this wine.

167
00:15:11,415 --> 00:15:12,919
There are only a few bottles in the world.

168
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,460
I'm afraid that I can't afford it.

169
00:15:14,932 --> 00:15:16,162
It's 580 yuan.

170
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,482
That's good.

171
00:15:18,695 --> 00:15:22,002
A 580 yuan bottle of wine doesn't require treating by someone else.

172
00:15:25,256 --> 00:15:29,882
So, I'm worth 580 yuan divided by 10,

173
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,962
58 yuan.

174
00:16:11,616 --> 00:16:13,562
The memories of being with you

175
00:16:14,136 --> 00:16:16,122
are so beautiful and intoxicating.

176
00:16:20,817 --> 00:16:22,962
Maybe you are really drunk.

177
00:17:15,752 --> 00:17:17,442
- Morning.   - Morning.

178
00:17:21,938 --> 00:17:23,122
Shu Yi.

179
00:17:23,384 --> 00:17:25,464
The time for Yunchuang Annual Strategy Conference has been set.

180
00:17:25,575 --> 00:17:27,285
They sent you an invitation, right?

181
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:38,682
When it rains, it pours.

182
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,682
The time was only decided today.

183
00:17:43,878 --> 00:17:45,480
The invitation letter couldn't have come so quickly.

184
00:17:45,576 --> 00:17:48,974
Anyway, the interview with Shi Yan received a good response.

185
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,842
They must have sent it to you.

186
00:18:08,773 --> 00:18:10,882
(Shi Yan must still be mad.)

187
00:18:11,406 --> 00:18:13,276
(There are two issues left this year.)

188
00:18:13,415 --> 00:18:15,294
(A review of year-end press conferences of each company)

189
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,882
(must be the only front-page content choice at the end of the year.)

190
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:22,162
(No. No matter how he feels, I have to go.)

191
00:18:27,656 --> 00:18:29,285
This edition has added the part about Le'an.

192
00:18:29,366 --> 00:18:30,856
We also invited Mr. Chen.

193
00:18:31,004 --> 00:18:33,887
Take a look. Is there anything else that needs to be modified?

194
00:18:34,016 --> 00:18:35,019
No problem.

195
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,399
Let's arrange it like this.

196
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,619
Okay.

197
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,039
(Mr. Shi, see you next week.)

198
00:18:45,566 --> 00:18:46,665
Wait.

199
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,882
- Are there any arrangements with the media?   - Right, Mr. Shi.

200
00:18:49,967 --> 00:18:51,632
As usual, nothing is missing.

201
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:54,722
We added some new media...

202
00:18:55,775 --> 00:18:57,439
I've confirmed the list of new media.

203
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,922
That includes Financial Introduce.

204
00:19:04,855 --> 00:19:06,882
I'll go remind them again.

205
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,922
A courier from Mingyu Yunchuang.

206
00:19:18,055 --> 00:19:19,476
(It's here.)

207
00:19:19,815 --> 00:19:21,455
(It seems like Shi Yan isn't so petty after all.)

208
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:23,610
(He's just unwilling to admit he's kind.)

209
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,115
(I'll forgive him then.)

210
00:19:25,271 --> 00:19:27,223
(When I go to the press conference, I'll thank him properly.)

211
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,802
(And, I'll treat him to a meal.)

212
00:19:29,111 --> 00:19:31,212
Yu Ling, this is the courier for you.

213
00:19:31,751 --> 00:19:33,042
Mine?

214
00:19:33,335 --> 00:19:34,555
Thanks.

215
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:50,139
Bei Er, hurry and collect some information about Mingyu Yunchuang.

216
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,867
Send it to me as soon as you can.

217
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,139
Okay, Yu Ling.

218
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,546
I have lots of work to do now.

219
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,389
What's going on?

220
00:20:00,216 --> 00:20:02,322
Could it be the editor-in-chief?

221
00:20:10,455 --> 00:20:12,804
(Uncle didn't fail me.)

222
00:20:12,966 --> 00:20:16,002
(But this play is a bit too much.)

223
00:20:22,657 --> 00:20:24,603
You came to find me but you don't even say anything?

224
00:20:28,575 --> 00:20:30,535
The editor-in-chief and I were worried before.

225
00:20:30,719 --> 00:20:32,839
Now, for the Yunchuang and Guan Capital's conferences,

226
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,761
you will attend one, and Yu Ling will attend the other.

227
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,429
It's actually easier now.

228
00:20:37,744 --> 00:20:38,984
It's my fault.

229
00:20:39,135 --> 00:20:40,635
I didn't handle it well.

230
00:20:42,069 --> 00:20:43,159
It's over.

231
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,800
I'm doomed.

232
00:20:45,216 --> 00:20:46,669
What's over?

233
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:48,859
It's just a press conference.

234
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:50,989
You've had a lot of front-page coverage this year.

235
00:20:51,077 --> 00:20:52,626
You did really well.

236
00:20:52,855 --> 00:20:55,295
Take advantage of this break to rest well

237
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,071
and prepare for the plans ahead.

238
00:20:57,176 --> 00:20:58,845
Fight again next year.

239
00:20:58,953 --> 00:21:00,842
I'm going to do a special coverage on Yunchuang.

240
00:21:00,942 --> 00:21:02,495
I have to go to this press conference.

241
00:21:02,664 --> 00:21:04,847
I want to put this special coverage in the digital magazine

242
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,882
as an independent special coverage.

243
00:21:07,535 --> 00:21:10,295
Even if you go to the press conference and handle Shi Yan,

244
00:21:10,476 --> 00:21:11,717
the digital magazine promotion

245
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,802
would still take a long time.

246
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,220
I understand.

247
00:21:16,896 --> 00:21:19,322
I can't change the editor-in-chief's mind all at once.

248
00:21:19,527 --> 00:21:21,247
So, I have to seize every opportunity

249
00:21:21,335 --> 00:21:23,285
and shorten the time for long-term plans.

250
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,236
All the best.

251
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:28,765
Oh, if you go,

252
00:21:29,055 --> 00:21:30,476
remember to bring Yue along.

253
00:21:31,496 --> 00:21:32,576
Bring her?

254
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:36,648
I'm not sure if I can get in. How can I bring her?

255
00:21:38,999 --> 00:21:42,308
Is there any place that you, Zheng Shu Yi, can't get in?

256
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:48,200
Ms. Yi, why don't you get someone else to guide Qin Shi Yue?

257
00:21:48,281 --> 00:21:49,802
I don't think I could guide her.

258
00:21:49,953 --> 00:21:51,793
Why would a rich second-generation like Shi Yue

259
00:21:51,874 --> 00:21:54,700
come to work in such a harsh environment?

260
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:58,046
Wouldn't staying at home or doing something she likes be better?

261
00:22:00,055 --> 00:22:02,366
Don't you think Yue has a pure heart?

262
00:22:04,201 --> 00:22:06,871
Not only is she pure-hearted, but she also has a unique way of thinking.

263
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,842
Ms. Yi, I just couldn't guide her.

264
00:22:12,855 --> 00:22:14,762
Isn't it good to be pure-hearted?

265
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,750
Do you like the deceitful person?

266
00:22:17,815 --> 00:22:19,605
Be a good person before doing anything.

267
00:22:19,696 --> 00:22:22,002
Yue does have many shortcomings.

268
00:22:22,135 --> 00:22:24,882
But I believe she can be trained.

269
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,616
You have to believe me.

270
00:22:26,696 --> 00:22:29,002
Take good care of her. Guide her properly.

271
00:22:29,256 --> 00:22:31,082
Think of it as helping me.

272
00:22:45,135 --> 00:22:46,135
Shi Yue.

273
00:22:46,579 --> 00:22:48,271
Yunchuang is about to have a press conference.

274
00:22:48,352 --> 00:22:49,454
Take a look at the related materials.

275
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:51,044
Come with me on that day.

276
00:22:53,095 --> 00:22:56,638
Shu Yi. You don't have an invitation, right?

277
00:22:57,815 --> 00:22:59,646
You don't have to worry about that.

278
00:23:00,575 --> 00:23:03,255
But I haven't finished organizing the recording you assigned to me.

279
00:23:03,335 --> 00:23:05,420
I asked you to organize the interview recordings before

280
00:23:05,501 --> 00:23:07,756
so that you can get familiar with the workflow

281
00:23:07,837 --> 00:23:09,442
and gain a deeper understanding of the industry.

282
00:23:09,579 --> 00:23:11,402
Mingyu Yunchuang is at the forefront of the industry this year.

283
00:23:11,483 --> 00:23:14,322
All journalists in this industry want to go to this press conference.

284
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:17,402
Shi Yan has clear ideas and an accurate market understanding.

285
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:19,811
You have only heard of Shi Yan's recordings before.

286
00:23:19,892 --> 00:23:22,322
This time, you can experience his charm in person.

287
00:23:31,815 --> 00:23:34,245
The editor is really biased.

288
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:37,482
She must be taking care of her emotions.

289
00:23:38,038 --> 00:23:40,897
But the chance given by the editor and Shi Yan

290
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,002
carry different significance, alright?

291
00:23:44,736 --> 00:23:45,916
Hurry up.

292
00:24:30,341 --> 00:24:31,401
Yu You.

293
00:24:31,594 --> 00:24:33,562
Your phone is ringing. Someone is looking for you.

294
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:52,199
Shi Yan.

295
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,040
Do you still have the media invitation for the Yunchuang press conference?

296
00:24:55,878 --> 00:24:56,898
Why?

297
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,082
It's that Miss Zheng again?

298
00:24:59,224 --> 00:25:00,894
Yes, how did you know?

299
00:25:02,775 --> 00:25:04,966
I met this journalist when I just returned to the country.

300
00:25:06,055 --> 00:25:08,275
You are so diligent in helping her to get invitations.

301
00:25:08,471 --> 00:25:10,671
Tell. Are you trying to pursue her

302
00:25:10,767 --> 00:25:12,242
or is she trying to pursue you?

303
00:25:14,256 --> 00:25:16,315
No. We are still friends.

304
00:25:16,424 --> 00:25:18,224
We are from the same hometown, and we were schoolmates,

305
00:25:18,337 --> 00:25:19,485
so we could chat a lot.

306
00:25:19,566 --> 00:25:20,665
Anyway,

307
00:25:21,335 --> 00:25:23,775
a senior taking care of a junior. Isn't that what's supposed to be?

308
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,136
You think everyone is like you,

309
00:25:25,216 --> 00:25:27,359
fond of protecting the weak and acting as a flower guardian?

310
00:25:30,055 --> 00:25:31,055
How come I remember

311
00:25:31,135 --> 00:25:33,960
Miss Zheng had just finished interviewing you?

312
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,389
Didn't you give her an invitation?

313
00:25:41,736 --> 00:25:43,082
So, do you still have it?

314
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,980
No.

315
00:25:51,637 --> 00:25:53,882
If you win me, maybe there will be.

316
00:25:56,921 --> 00:25:58,271
We've worked a whole day.

317
00:25:58,368 --> 00:26:00,482
We thought we were here to relax.

318
00:26:00,656 --> 00:26:03,206
But it turned out we're here to be punching bags.

319
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,621
I'm asking you.

320
00:26:04,702 --> 00:26:06,972
How come you're still so eager to win after work?

321
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,762
Come on.

322
00:26:23,629 --> 00:26:26,099
It shouldn't be Shi Yan's problem.

323
00:26:26,638 --> 00:26:27,959
He is such a big boss.

324
00:26:28,055 --> 00:26:31,042
He wouldn't be concerned about media invitations.

325
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,939
It must be a misunderstanding.

326
00:26:34,942 --> 00:26:36,202
It's no use thinking about it.

327
00:26:36,896 --> 00:26:38,495
Why not just give him a call

328
00:26:38,575 --> 00:26:39,922
and ask him what he means?

329
00:26:40,126 --> 00:26:43,162
If it's a misunderstanding, ask him for the invitation letter.

330
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,861
If he's still angry,

331
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:47,289
apologize to him and try to make him happy.

332
00:26:55,975 --> 00:26:57,054
(I'm sorry.)

333
00:26:57,205 --> 00:26:58,682
(I lost the competition to Shi Yan.)

334
00:26:58,775 --> 00:27:01,366
(I can't help you with the invitation.)

335
00:27:01,615 --> 00:27:03,285
Is it really him?

336
00:27:06,495 --> 00:27:07,755
(Shan Shan.)

337
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,109
(I'm really doomed this time.)

338
00:27:14,535 --> 00:27:16,896
(Regarding Mingyu Yunchuang Annual Strategy Conference in two days, )

339
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:19,907
(Shi Yan purposely sent an invitation card to Xu Yu Ling.)

340
00:27:20,023 --> 00:27:23,122
(Shi Yan did it on purpose?)

341
00:27:24,496 --> 00:27:27,402
(And, he didn't send one to me.)

342
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:30,576
(Shi Yan overheard it and got angry.)

343
00:27:30,663 --> 00:27:32,852
(He even held a grudge.)

344
00:27:35,456 --> 00:27:37,362
(Is this what you mean?)

345
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,562
(Are you trying to piss me off?)

346
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,140
(I'm so jealous.)

347
00:27:45,878 --> 00:27:46,919
(Don't worry.)

348
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,873
(I'll ask my friend and see if I can get another one.)

349
00:27:51,696 --> 00:27:53,535
(Great! Thank you, Shan Shan.)

350
00:27:53,633 --> 00:27:55,322
(You are my savior.)

351
00:27:56,055 --> 00:27:57,442
(I can't get it.)

352
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,061
(I can't beat him.)

353
00:28:01,437 --> 00:28:02,986
Can't beat him?

354
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,682
My friend can't do anything either.

355
00:28:14,824 --> 00:28:17,402
Shi Yan is so petty, all right?

356
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,220
Exactly.

357
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:23,642
Forget it. I'll just sneak in with you.

358
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:25,679
If he wasn't so narrow-minded,

359
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,541
would I have to sneak around like this?

360
00:28:27,996 --> 00:28:29,204
I told you before.

361
00:28:29,293 --> 00:28:30,802
He just cares about you.

362
00:28:30,883 --> 00:28:33,042
Why else would he make things difficult for you?

363
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,802
The more he refuses to let me go, the more determined I am to go.

364
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,722
Since you take the bet, be willing to admit defeat.

365
00:29:06,815 --> 00:29:08,714
But I think it's a bit of a pity.

366
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,080
Miss Zheng is a great journalist.

367
00:29:11,176 --> 00:29:13,042
Her articles are very insightful.

368
00:29:13,527 --> 00:29:15,356
I couldn't help her this time.

369
00:29:15,496 --> 00:29:16,839
I hope she won't scold me.

370
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,380
If she has to scold someone, scold you.

371
00:29:36,197 --> 00:29:37,218
Hey.

372
00:29:37,855 --> 00:29:40,493
Have the invitations for the press conference been sent out?

373
00:29:40,626 --> 00:29:44,378
(Yes, Mr. Shi. The media have been receiving them since this morning.)

374
00:29:48,095 --> 00:29:49,765
(Hello, Mr. Shi?)

375
00:29:50,256 --> 00:29:53,775
(Financial Introduce and Jiangcheng TV Station have replied.)

376
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,180
(They will attend.)

377
00:30:03,375 --> 00:30:04,922
It's not a misunderstanding, right?

378
00:30:05,148 --> 00:30:07,408
Then, I'll have to go and ask him in person.

379
00:30:30,335 --> 00:30:32,402
Why are you making loud noises in the middle of the night?

380
00:30:36,312 --> 00:30:37,631
I make noises?

381
00:30:37,712 --> 00:30:39,376
You don't turn on the lights and sit here at midnight.

382
00:30:39,457 --> 00:30:41,017
You look like a ghost.

383
00:30:42,367 --> 00:30:46,307
Do you know that you almost scared your only niece to death?

384
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:49,260
It hurts.

385
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,682
Everything's normal. You are fine.

386
00:30:51,872 --> 00:30:53,212
Hurry up and go back to sleep.

387
00:31:01,343 --> 00:31:03,694
Uncle, what's wrong?

388
00:31:05,496 --> 00:31:07,006
Did you get dumped?

389
00:31:09,298 --> 00:31:11,165
Or you didn't even have the chance to experience love?

390
00:31:11,248 --> 00:31:12,918
Was it that woman from last time?

391
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:16,926
Are you having a one-sided crush?

392
00:31:20,335 --> 00:31:21,516
Qin Shi Yue.

393
00:31:21,696 --> 00:31:23,206
Let me say it again.

394
00:31:23,366 --> 00:31:24,626
Go back to sleep.

395
00:31:25,671 --> 00:31:26,842
Okay, Uncle.

396
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,220
Good night, Uncle.

Miss Xu, right?

400
00:31:54,727 --> 00:31:55,896
- Yes.   - Hello.

401
00:31:55,976 --> 00:31:57,236
I'll take you to the scene.

402
00:31:57,317 --> 00:31:58,857
- Okay, thank you.   - This way.

403
00:32:06,736 --> 00:32:09,002
This seat. Please take a seat.

404
00:32:09,951 --> 00:32:11,562
It's so close to the front.

405
00:32:11,976 --> 00:32:14,122
Financial Introduce is a very important media partner.

406
00:32:14,271 --> 00:32:17,002
The CEO specially instructed us to give you the front-row seat.

407
00:32:17,855 --> 00:32:19,676
- Please sit.   - Thank you.

(Mingyu Yunchuang Annual Strategy Conference)

409
00:32:36,967 --> 00:32:39,127
(The seat today is not bad.)

410
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,242
Mr. Shi, do you want to go to the lounge first?

411
00:32:49,388 --> 00:32:50,448
No need.

412
00:33:12,766 --> 00:33:14,522
Mr. Shi, you are here.

413
00:33:14,733 --> 00:33:17,695
We put some important media in the front row seats.

414
00:33:21,271 --> 00:33:23,691
You should enhance your working skills if you have free time.

415
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,442
Well...

416
00:33:27,055 --> 00:33:28,855
Mr. Chen, this...

417
00:33:28,976 --> 00:33:30,682
Didn't you instruct us to look after

418
00:33:30,763 --> 00:33:33,322
the female journalist from Financial Introduce?

419
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,340
Come with me.

420
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,527
Miss Xu.

421
00:33:49,821 --> 00:33:50,860
- Hello.   - Sorry.

422
00:33:50,954 --> 00:33:52,958
Just now, my colleague took you to the wrong seat.

423
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,239
Please forgive us.

424
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,520
Come with me.

425
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,820
Please.

426
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:30,850
Mr. Shi, everything is arranged.

427
00:34:58,871 --> 00:34:59,891
Yue.

428
00:35:00,534 --> 00:35:04,682
Actually, there's no need to dress so formally in this kind of event.

429
00:35:05,976 --> 00:35:07,172
(I was careless.)

430
00:35:07,253 --> 00:35:09,338
(I thought that wearing black wouldn't draw attention.)

431
00:35:15,486 --> 00:35:16,586
Shu Yi.

432
00:35:21,769 --> 00:35:23,638
- It's you.   - It's you.

433
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,981
You two know each other?

434
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,282
The press conference is about to start. Let's go in and talk.

435

Let's go.

Hello, how many people? Please sign your attendance.

437
00:35:46,653 --> 00:35:48,456
Hello, sorry.

438
00:35:48,576 --> 00:35:50,844
You can only bring one staff with one invitation card.

439
00:35:51,648 --> 00:35:53,673
- But I...   - Shu Yi.

440
00:35:53,932 --> 00:35:55,177
The press conference is about to start.

441
00:35:55,258 --> 00:35:57,439
You don't need to worry about me. You guys go in first.

442
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,719
Shan Shan, you take Yue in first.

443
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,242
I'll think of something.

444
00:36:01,416 --> 00:36:03,926
Shu Yi, it's not really necessary.

445
00:36:11,015 --> 00:36:13,402
You guys go in quickly. I've thought of something.

446
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,595
Then, you hurry up. Let's go.

447
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:20,173
Shu Yi, I'll wait for you outside.

448

(He's coming toward me.)

449
00:36:27,255 --> 00:36:29,366
(He must have come out specially to look for me.)

450
00:36:36,793 --> 00:36:39,522
(It's over. Uncle has seen me.)

451
00:36:39,855 --> 00:36:42,322
(What is he up to?)

452
00:36:42,508 --> 00:36:45,722
(He won't make me repeat the conference content at night, right?)

453
00:36:45,942 --> 00:36:47,681
Shu Yi, I'm going in first. You hurry up.

454
00:36:53,416 --> 00:36:55,322
Mr. Shi, what a coincidence.

455
00:36:57,175 --> 00:36:59,522
Long time no see. Have you been busy with work recently?

456

(Mingyu Yunchuang Annual Strategy Conference, VIP Route)

457
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:28,538
Thank you, Mr. Shi.

458
00:37:36,655 --> 00:37:37,776
Mr. Shi,

459
00:37:37,856 --> 00:37:40,242
did Xu Yu Ling conduct the interview better than me?

460
00:37:40,327 --> 00:37:42,078
Or was her outline better than mine?

461
00:37:46,463 --> 00:37:48,823
Confirming the media list and sending out the invitations

462
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,442
are not my job.

463
00:37:54,296 --> 00:37:55,356
Mr. Shi.

464
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:58,249
Arrange a seat for her.

465
00:37:59,296 --> 00:38:01,085
Miss Zheng, please come with me.

466
00:38:04,655 --> 00:38:05,802
His language skills are so bad.

467
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:07,039
He can't even explain properly.

468
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,620
Let's see his performance on stage.

469
00:38:14,336 --> 00:38:15,555
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

470
00:38:15,816 --> 00:38:16,975
You're welcome, Miss Zheng.

471
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,821
This seat is specially arranged for you by Mr. Shi.

472
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:21,759
It's our PR Department's mistake

473
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,881
that the invitation wasn't sent to you.

474
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,319
Please forgive us.

475
00:38:27,492 --> 00:38:30,855
Mr. Chen, I have a small request.

476
00:38:30,936 --> 00:38:31,936
What is it?

477
00:38:32,055 --> 00:38:33,242
I have two colleagues.

478
00:38:33,392 --> 00:38:35,993
Do you mind if we sit together?

479
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,259
No problem.

480
00:38:50,372 --> 00:38:53,922
How did you get in and get us such good seats?

481
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,002
It was arranged by him.

482
00:38:58,394 --> 00:39:00,842
Then, you should thank him properly.

483
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,322
(Are you here for the press conference today?)

484
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,699
(Yes.)

485
00:39:27,376 --> 00:39:29,045
(Okay, see you later.)

486
00:39:37,433 --> 00:39:38,842
(You're here?)

487
00:39:39,883 --> 00:39:41,242
(I'm here.)

488
00:39:42,617 --> 00:39:43,882
(See you later.)

489
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,060
(Okay.)

490
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:56,802
What's this? There's no setup at all.

491
00:39:57,577 --> 00:39:58,958
That's his style.

492
00:40:06,095 --> 00:40:08,085
I hate press conferences the most.

493
00:40:08,278 --> 00:40:09,869
Dull and boring.

494
00:40:10,416 --> 00:40:12,966
I have to listen to a few hours of lectures.

495
00:40:17,425 --> 00:40:18,706
God!

496
00:40:18,809 --> 00:40:20,795
Who can save me?

497
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,741
Is it starting?

498
00:41:19,367 --> 00:41:22,219
(Mr. Shi, they're already downstairs.)

499
00:41:32,307 --> 00:41:35,204
(Mr. Shi, the most macho CEO.)

500
00:41:40,874 --> 00:41:42,482
(Today isn't Mingyu's press conference.)

501
00:41:42,563 --> 00:41:44,482
(It's your personal charm press conference.)

502
00:41:44,597 --> 00:41:46,637
(Although I can't speak out loud right now, )

503
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,150
(I'm already screaming for you in my heart.)

504
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,820
Mr. Shi.

505
00:42:19,936 --> 00:42:21,575
Greetings, everyone.

506
00:42:21,718 --> 00:42:22,959
Sorry to keep you all waiting.

507
00:42:23,055 --> 00:42:24,154
I'm Shi Yan.

508
00:42:33,936 --> 00:42:36,936
Shi Yan has really made a name for himself in the past few years.

509
00:42:37,089 --> 00:42:38,999
The father and son of the Shi family are really smart.

510
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,842
When he left, Shi Yan was relieved of a great burden.

511
00:42:42,877 --> 00:42:45,902
Welcome to Mingyu Yunchuang Annual Strategy Conference.
