00:01:31,202 --> 00:01:36,044
(Only For Love)

2
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:39,042
(Episode 16)

3
00:01:48,823 --> 00:01:51,552
Did you tell Mr. Fan the wrong place?

4
00:01:51,762 --> 00:01:53,762
He can't make it, he has something to attend to.

5
00:01:53,843 --> 00:01:55,162
He can't make it?

6
00:01:55,884 --> 00:01:57,402
Then I'll call for a cab.

7
00:01:59,637 --> 00:02:01,362
I don't ride in other people's cars.

8
00:02:03,317 --> 00:02:05,307
Then shall we continue waiting?

9
00:02:05,872 --> 00:02:07,242
We could also walk.

10
00:02:07,923 --> 00:02:08,963
Walk?

11
00:02:13,325 --> 00:02:16,155
Do you really want to walk? It's a bit far.

12
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:26,029
It's so comfortable here. It feels like a good place for retirement.

13
00:02:27,684 --> 00:02:29,906
Miss Zheng, you're on the rise in your career

14
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:31,689
and is already thinking about retirement.

15
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,188
A good life is the motivation for our hard work.

16
00:02:36,145 --> 00:02:37,858
I don't know why, but as I walk with you by the river,

17
00:02:37,882 --> 00:02:39,242
looking at the scenery,

18
00:02:39,356 --> 00:02:41,178
I suddenly started thinking about the future.

19
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:50,024
What plans do you have then?

20
00:04:26,605 --> 00:04:28,908
You better have a good reason to call.

21
00:04:29,398 --> 00:04:31,682
(Sorry, wrong number.)

22
00:04:35,895 --> 00:04:38,922
Why is Uncle so scary?

23
00:04:39,675 --> 00:04:42,266
It's so late. Is he busy with something?

24
00:04:47,931 --> 00:04:50,712
Could it be that I ruined his plan?

25
00:04:52,174 --> 00:04:55,842
Maybe he's on a date with his girlfriend.

26
00:04:56,948 --> 00:04:58,289
Maybe...

27
00:04:59,878 --> 00:05:02,787
Yue, what are you mumbling about?

28
00:05:06,568 --> 00:05:07,602
I'm thinking,

29
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:10,362
if a man gets irritated and doesn't want to talk to you

30
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,799
when you call him,

31
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,630
chances are he's with another woman.

32
00:05:18,081 --> 00:05:20,642
What's going on in that little head of yours every day?

33
00:05:25,763 --> 00:05:26,782
Hello.

34
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:28,799
(What's the matter? I'm busy.)

35
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:30,280
I'm off work, you...

36
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,739
(I still have work to do, I'll talk to you later.)

37
00:05:42,844 --> 00:05:45,362
- Are you sure? - What?

38
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,250
About what you just said, how men react...

39
00:05:48,695 --> 00:05:49,834
I'm sure.

40
00:05:50,477 --> 00:05:51,638
Then tell me,

41
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:56,218
if a man is with another woman, what else would he say?

42
00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:00,739
He would say, "I'm busy".

43
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:04,256
And he would impatiently ask, "What's the matter?"

44
00:06:06,318 --> 00:06:07,698
Exactly.

45
00:06:08,236 --> 00:06:10,802
Why are you suddenly so interested in this?

46
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:14,402
Nothing. I'm just asking. I'm leaving now.

47
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:34,369
(Professor Yu, did you receive the surprise I gave you?)

48
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:36,642
Surprise?

49
00:06:41,298 --> 00:06:43,808
I did, did you buy these albums?

50
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:44,929
(These are too expensive.)

51
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:46,349
(I appreciate the gesture.)

52
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:50,162
(Take them with you next time you come to the college.)

53
00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:55,849
(Money can't buy happiness.)

54
00:06:55,968 --> 00:06:58,158
(Besides, these were free.)

55
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,922
(Are you off work?)

56
00:07:12,991 --> 00:07:16,490
(If you haven't eaten, let me treat you to the meal I owe you.)

57
00:07:16,571 --> 00:07:17,950
(You just returned to China.)

58
00:07:18,046 --> 00:07:20,362
(I'm sure you haven't tried many restaurants.)

59
00:07:20,551 --> 00:07:22,591
(I know all the good restaurants in Jiangcheng.)

60
00:07:22,678 --> 00:07:25,202
(What do you like to eat? I'll treat you.)

61
00:07:28,456 --> 00:07:30,757
(I'm sorry, I don't have time tonight.)

62
00:07:33,649 --> 00:07:35,882
Why is he rejecting me again?

63
00:07:45,148 --> 00:07:47,482
(It's okay, I can wait until you're done.)

64
00:07:47,575 --> 00:07:50,085
(Or we can go to a restaurant near your college.)

65
00:07:50,224 --> 00:07:52,494
(You need to have dinner anyway.)

66
00:07:53,054 --> 00:07:55,882
(No, thanks. I'll just go to the cafeteria.)

67
00:08:00,365 --> 00:08:01,955
This isn't a polite decline.

68
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:04,259
This is a direct rejection.

69
00:08:04,866 --> 00:08:07,217
You didn't even make up an excuse.

70
00:08:11,596 --> 00:08:12,762
Got it.

71
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,442
Shu Yi.

72
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,795
You still haven't answered my question from earlier.

73
00:09:06,957 --> 00:09:07,973
I...

74
00:09:08,118 --> 00:09:09,587
I haven't decided yet.

75
00:09:13,764 --> 00:09:14,764
You...

76
00:09:15,358 --> 00:09:16,602
Take your time.

77
00:09:19,371 --> 00:09:21,402
I'll prepare an outline for you.

78
00:09:24,804 --> 00:09:26,360
I have an interview for my column tomorrow.

79
00:09:26,384 --> 00:09:28,322
I'm going back first. Good night.

80
00:09:36,234 --> 00:09:37,333
Good night.

81
00:09:45,221 --> 00:09:48,447
Young, promising and handsome Professor Yu,

82
00:09:48,551 --> 00:09:50,003
your takeout is here.

83
00:10:02,198 --> 00:10:05,002
(This is considered we're having dinner together.)

84
00:10:10,171 --> 00:10:11,362
(Thanks.)

85
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,641
(If you really want to thank me, )

86
00:10:16,737 --> 00:10:18,686
(can you fulfill a request?)

87
00:10:23,052 --> 00:10:25,673
(Send me pictures of your meal too.)

88
00:10:40,615 --> 00:10:43,602
Professor Yu, your girlfriend ordered this, right?

89
00:10:43,717 --> 00:10:44,737
No.

90
00:10:45,668 --> 00:10:47,668
We're leaving now. Bye.

91
00:10:52,981 --> 00:10:55,002
He ate a little of the dishes from Xu's Kitchen.

92
00:10:55,733 --> 00:10:58,002
He didn't touch the spicy dishes.

93
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,242
He finished everything from Yubaoxuan.

94
00:11:04,718 --> 00:11:07,318
(You can't eat spicy food. I'll keep that in mind for next time.)

95
00:11:07,394 --> 00:11:09,042
(You like Yubaoxuan's food.)

96
00:11:09,123 --> 00:11:10,880
(Next time, we can dine in the restaurant.)

97
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,142
Yubaoxuan?

98
00:11:24,377 --> 00:11:26,922
I don't have high requirements for food.

99
00:11:27,003 --> 00:11:28,974
What's more important to me is the person eating with me.

100
00:11:28,998 --> 00:11:31,757
(Miss Qin, it must have cost you a fortune)

101
00:11:31,837 --> 00:11:33,877
(to get those out-of-print albums of Song Yue Lan.)

102
00:11:34,008 --> 00:11:37,362
But sometimes, money can't solve all the problems.

103
00:11:37,557 --> 00:11:38,779
When evaluating something,

104
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,359
you have to consider whether it's necessary or worth it.

105
00:11:41,525 --> 00:11:45,122
(Being with someone you like, even eating street food can bring happiness.)

106
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,759
(Listening to music on your phone can be delightful too.)

107
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,081
Miss Qin, I also hope that you

108
00:11:49,214 --> 00:11:51,496
can find someone who appreciates your interests,

109
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:53,202
(someone to dine at Yubaoxuan with)

110
00:11:53,358 --> 00:11:55,722
(and collect Song Yue Lan's albums together.)

111
00:12:14,631 --> 00:12:15,962
Qin Shi Yue.

112
00:12:16,429 --> 00:12:18,842
You can't give up so easily.

113
00:12:19,616 --> 00:12:22,922
He accepted the meal you sent and even thanked you.

114
00:12:23,206 --> 00:12:25,762
He just doesn't like you spending money recklessly.

115
00:12:25,893 --> 00:12:28,354
Now that you know, be more careful next time.

116
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:52,362
(Sent to the wrong person?)

117
00:12:52,517 --> 00:12:53,562
(Um?)

118
00:12:53,878 --> 00:12:54,878
(No.)

119
00:12:57,598 --> 00:12:59,998
(I saved you some time so that you can prepare the outline.)

120
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:09,301
Calm down.

121
00:13:09,954 --> 00:13:12,754
It's not too late to prepare the outline after the interview tomorrow.

122
00:13:30,718 --> 00:13:32,362
What are you doing here?

123
00:13:33,322 --> 00:13:35,682
Did you forget that I live across from you?

124
00:13:45,918 --> 00:13:48,882
Miss Zheng, this is the coffee Mr. Shi ordered for you.

125
00:14:03,296 --> 00:14:04,562
Get in the car.

126
00:14:21,216 --> 00:14:22,480
Thank you for the ride, Mr. Shi.

127
00:14:22,504 --> 00:14:23,842
Thank you for the coffee.

128
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:34,482
Miss Zheng?

129
00:14:34,598 --> 00:14:36,202
What brings you here today?

130
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,400
Hello, I'm a journalist from Financial Introduce, Zheng Shu Yi.

131
00:14:39,527 --> 00:14:41,917
You're Miss Zheng?

132
00:14:43,872 --> 00:14:45,562
Then let me show you around first.

133
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,042
Visit your factory?

134
00:14:47,175 --> 00:14:49,482
Did you forget? I visited it yesterday.

135
00:14:50,677 --> 00:14:52,748
All right, let me take you upstairs then.

136
00:14:53,334 --> 00:14:54,610
This way, please.

137
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:57,401
Mr. Shi, where should we go now?

138
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,522
This way, please.

139
00:15:12,408 --> 00:15:13,602
This way, please.

140
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:17,973
Miss Zheng, please wait here for a moment. I'll report to Mr. Jiang.

141
00:15:23,369 --> 00:15:25,882
Mr. Jiang, Miss Zheng from Financial Introduce is here.

142
00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:27,359
Tell her to wait for a while.

143
00:15:28,757 --> 00:15:30,717
- Miss Zheng is... - Mr. Jiang.

144
00:15:33,483 --> 00:15:34,663
It's you?

145
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:37,682
I had an appointment with you at 10 am.

146
00:15:37,765 --> 00:15:39,626
It's already 15 minutes past.

147
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:43,881
Mr. Jiang, this is the journalist from Financial Introduce, Zheng Shu Yi.

148
00:15:45,598 --> 00:15:46,819
Miss Zheng?

149
00:15:48,454 --> 00:15:49,642
Then yesterday...

150
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:52,642
Mr. Shi and I are good friends.

151
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,882
Miss Zheng, you really have a wide social circle.

152
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,499
Not only did you know Mr. Guan Xiang Cheng,

153
00:15:59,523 --> 00:16:01,322
but you're also a good friend of Mr. Shi.

154
00:16:02,118 --> 00:16:04,118
We also got to know each other after the conflict.

155
00:16:04,143 --> 00:16:06,583
Since Mr. Shi is your friend,

156
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:09,843
we can still consider cooperating with Yunchuang.

157
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,482
That's not necessary.

158
00:16:11,652 --> 00:16:13,361
Mr. Jiang, you can handle this matter professionally.

159
00:16:13,385 --> 00:16:15,103
Yunchuang is a professional company.

160
00:16:15,184 --> 00:16:17,934
I can't influence Mr. Shi's thoughts.

161
00:16:21,318 --> 00:16:23,498
Mr. Jiang, can we start?

162
00:16:23,939 --> 00:16:24,999
Certainly.

163
00:16:25,592 --> 00:16:29,122
When I just graduated from university, I interviewed with many companies.

164
00:16:29,249 --> 00:16:32,002
They all considered me an inexperienced graduate.

165
00:16:32,088 --> 00:16:33,469
That's normal.

166
00:16:33,648 --> 00:16:35,042
In the end, I had no choice

167
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:38,338
but to work for a small factory selling batteries.

168
00:16:38,538 --> 00:16:42,242
Little did I know, I ended up where I am today.

169
00:16:43,073 --> 00:16:46,286
I've read about your entrepreneurial story

170
00:16:46,367 --> 00:16:47,757
in the "Financial Vision" magazine.

171
00:16:47,781 --> 00:16:50,232
I believe the readers would be more interested in your current self

172
00:16:50,256 --> 00:16:51,480
and the current state of Zhanlan.

173
00:16:51,504 --> 00:16:53,375
Yes, of course.

174
00:16:54,497 --> 00:16:56,177
Our initial goal in establishing Zhanlan

175
00:16:56,272 --> 00:16:58,120
was to create the best batteries in China

176
00:16:58,204 --> 00:17:01,082
and let our batteries go abroad and go global.

177
00:17:01,258 --> 00:17:02,642
To this day,

178
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,503
we have never stopped moving forward and never become complacent.

179
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:08,402
Because we bear the responsibility and mission.

180
00:17:08,823 --> 00:17:12,043
What are your thoughts on the recent incident?

181
00:17:12,248 --> 00:17:14,602
Forgive my bluntness, but without resolving this issue,

182
00:17:14,683 --> 00:17:17,222
it's hard to achieve your stated goals.

183
00:17:18,775 --> 00:17:19,875
Miss Zheng.

184
00:17:20,168 --> 00:17:23,808
On average, a car has about 10,000 non-removable independent components.

185
00:17:23,889 --> 00:17:26,329
For example, an F1 race car has as many as 20,000 components.

186
00:17:26,393 --> 00:17:28,712
So, there are many possible reasons for an accident.

187
00:17:28,832 --> 00:17:31,343
It's not necessarily directly caused by the battery.

188
00:17:33,072 --> 00:17:37,393
Also, our cooperation with Hengxin has always been stable and continuous.

189
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,553
This indicates that the problem doesn't lie with us.

190
00:17:39,664 --> 00:17:40,704
In any case,

191
00:17:41,848 --> 00:17:44,599
Miss Zheng, why do you need to be aggressive?

192
00:17:45,001 --> 00:17:46,601
Zhanlan has always had a good reputation

193
00:17:46,654 --> 00:17:48,442
and development momentum in the industry.

194
00:17:49,261 --> 00:17:52,955
Our cooperation with Financial Introduce won't be limited to this article.

195
00:17:53,681 --> 00:17:57,613
In fact, I believe the readers of this magazine

196
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:59,873
don't necessarily want to know the details

197
00:18:00,008 --> 00:18:01,954
of an accident investigation report.

198
00:18:02,547 --> 00:18:04,282
I understand. I'll present the details

199
00:18:04,402 --> 00:18:07,082
according to the accident investigation report.

200
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:15,210
Miss Zheng, this must be your first time in Ancheng.

201
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:16,402
Do you know this?

202
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:19,428
Tianshan tea from Ancheng is very famous.

203
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:25,202
From tea picking to tea processing, it has a history of over 100 years.

204
00:18:25,552 --> 00:18:29,263
Later, I'll have Ding bring some for you.

205
00:18:30,273 --> 00:18:33,522
I'll also see if there are any other local specialties to give you.

206
00:18:33,792 --> 00:18:37,242
You can bring them back and savor them.

207
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:40,322
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

208
00:18:40,433 --> 00:18:42,082
But I don't know much about tea,

209
00:18:42,217 --> 00:18:44,297
so there's no need to waste such precious tea on me.

210
00:18:46,128 --> 00:18:48,542
Everyone in the industry knows that Zhanlan has been seeking financing.

211
00:18:48,566 --> 00:18:51,583
So, Mr. Jiang, where do you plan to allocate this funding?

212
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:58,423
A company needs capital injection at any stage.

213
00:18:59,316 --> 00:19:01,712
As for this funding, we'll certainly use it for

214
00:19:01,792 --> 00:19:04,462
the company's development and technological improvements.

215
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,260
So, will it be used to increase production scale or to improve technology?

216
00:19:08,906 --> 00:19:10,282
Let me be more direct.

217
00:19:10,345 --> 00:19:12,365
Will this money be used to expand production lines

218
00:19:12,494 --> 00:19:13,774
or for research and development?

219
00:19:20,298 --> 00:19:22,002
Miss Zheng, you're well prepared.

220
00:19:22,105 --> 00:19:24,126
Your knowledge base is also very rich.

221
00:19:24,439 --> 00:19:28,753
I hope when you're writing this article, you can speak highly of Zhanlan.

222
00:19:28,929 --> 00:19:31,768
After all, establishing a company is difficult,

223
00:19:31,855 --> 00:19:35,286
but destroying it sometimes only requires a few words.

224
00:19:35,782 --> 00:19:37,455
What makes a company survive and thrive

225
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,122
are excellent technology and high-quality products.

226
00:19:40,203 --> 00:19:43,042
Destroying a company definitely requires more than just a few words.

227
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:46,642
If you feel that a few truthful words can ruin Zhanlan,

228
00:19:46,725 --> 00:19:48,996
perhaps you should reflect on that.

229
00:19:50,553 --> 00:19:52,202
I appreciate the advice.

230
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:55,413
As a company develops, it'll always encounter all kinds of challenges.

231
00:19:56,193 --> 00:19:58,512
Since you and Mr. Shi are good friends,

232
00:19:58,592 --> 00:20:02,712
for the sake of you, I'm willing to cooperate with Mr. Shi

233
00:20:02,822 --> 00:20:06,212
to address the concerns he has and achieve a win-win situation.

234
00:20:06,433 --> 00:20:07,812
What do you think?

235
00:20:08,962 --> 00:20:10,491
Mr. Jiang, you overestimate me.

236
00:20:10,572 --> 00:20:13,513
I'm just a journalist and I can't influence your decisions.

237
00:20:14,193 --> 00:20:15,613
Thank you for your valuable time.

238
00:20:16,689 --> 00:20:20,972
But it seems like Mr. Shi has deep affection for you.

239
00:20:22,528 --> 00:20:25,108
Ding told me that Mr. Shi sent you here.

240
00:20:25,189 --> 00:20:27,292
And he's still waiting downstairs now.

241
00:20:27,439 --> 00:20:30,353
Perhaps your small effort

242
00:20:30,433 --> 00:20:33,303
would be enough to reciprocate Mr. Shi's affection.

243
00:20:35,873 --> 00:20:38,144
This article will be published in the in-depth analysis section

244
00:20:38,168 --> 00:20:39,722
of the Financial Introduce.

245
00:20:39,832 --> 00:20:41,873
I will naturally state Zhanlan's advantages,

246
00:20:41,976 --> 00:20:46,045
but I also need to present the issues Zhanlan faces to the readers.

247
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,082
As for the content you desire,

248
00:20:48,239 --> 00:20:51,268
perhaps it'd be more suitable to publish it on your company's account.

249
00:20:51,392 --> 00:20:54,882
As for Mr. Shi, I can invite him to dinner as a token of appreciation.

250
00:21:07,072 --> 00:21:08,593
Miss Zheng, please accept it.

251
00:21:08,673 --> 00:21:10,153
Otherwise, I can't answer my boss.

252
00:21:10,233 --> 00:21:12,528
Mr. Ding, there's really no need for this. I don't drink tea.

253
00:21:12,552 --> 00:21:13,762
Please take it back.

254
00:21:13,874 --> 00:21:15,250
Please accept it.

255
00:21:15,331 --> 00:21:16,751
- No, thanks. - Miss Zheng.

256
00:21:20,022 --> 00:21:21,402
I'll get going now. Goodbye.

257
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:25,312
What a coincidence. Mr. Shi, you're here for work again?

258
00:21:28,167 --> 00:21:30,037
Today, I'll treat you to dinner.

259
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:33,642
Get in the car.

260
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:45,122
- Hello, Mom. - (Yi Yi, have you eaten?)

261
00:21:45,257 --> 00:21:47,407
(How are you and Yu You lately?)

262
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:49,882
(Just take him out for meals when you have the chance.)

263
00:21:49,985 --> 00:21:53,522
(In this day and age, girls can be more proactive.)

264
00:21:53,636 --> 00:21:55,362
I know.

265
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,171
I'm working now. I'll hang up.

266
00:22:00,734 --> 00:22:02,564
If you want, you can treat me too.

267
00:22:03,945 --> 00:22:06,482
Well, thank you for your proactive gesture, Miss Zheng.

268
00:22:10,619 --> 00:22:12,562
Is it still a bit unclear?

269
00:22:12,632 --> 00:22:14,512
This lesson covers relatively more topics.

270
00:22:14,592 --> 00:22:17,272
I hope everyone will review the material when you get back.

271
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:19,670
All right, that's it for today's class. Class dismissed.

272
00:22:19,993 --> 00:22:21,562
Thank you, Professor Yu.

273
00:22:24,115 --> 00:22:25,214
Professor Yu.

274
00:22:25,357 --> 00:22:27,306
Can we have lunch together?

275
00:22:28,872 --> 00:22:30,173
Follow me to the office.

276
00:22:31,181 --> 00:22:32,601
Your office?

277
00:22:32,913 --> 00:22:33,933
Okay!

278
00:22:34,392 --> 00:22:35,602
Professor Yu.

279
00:22:43,167 --> 00:22:44,282
Miss Qin.

280
00:22:45,118 --> 00:22:46,482
Please take it back.

281
00:22:47,673 --> 00:22:49,823
Did you bring me here for this?

282
00:22:52,526 --> 00:22:54,282
These are too expensive.

283
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,210
Nowadays, it's very convenient to listen to music on phones.

284
00:22:56,234 --> 00:22:58,231
You should take them back and keep them for yourself.

285
00:22:58,255 --> 00:23:00,706
I saw you at Song Yue Lan's concert.

286
00:23:00,787 --> 00:23:04,687
I guessed you must be her fan, so I thought of giving these to you.

287
00:23:05,524 --> 00:23:07,194
These don't cost anything.

288
00:23:09,022 --> 00:23:10,482
I appreciate your kindness.

289
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:13,695
Appreciating music comes from the heart, not a specific form.

290
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,767
If the form is greater than the music itself,

291
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:17,891
then it's not worth it, nor is it necessary.

292
00:23:18,632 --> 00:23:20,882
So, if you're just trying to please me,

293
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,549
please take these back.

294
00:23:25,552 --> 00:23:26,613
All right.

295
00:23:27,688 --> 00:23:29,882
I'll take them home and keep them for you.

296
00:23:29,974 --> 00:23:32,424
You'll realize in the future that these don't cost anything,

297
00:23:32,512 --> 00:23:34,261
and it's not about any form.

298
00:23:34,642 --> 00:23:36,882
It's just a small gesture within my means.

299
00:23:37,796 --> 00:23:41,015
So, can we go for lunch now?

300
00:23:42,527 --> 00:23:43,722
Miss Qin,

301
00:23:44,273 --> 00:23:45,613
I understand your feelings.

302
00:23:46,441 --> 00:23:47,742
You never said it out,

303
00:23:47,823 --> 00:23:49,803
and I'm not very good at handling these matters.

304
00:23:49,913 --> 00:23:53,022
But I think I should respond to you clearly today.

305
00:23:56,502 --> 00:23:58,251
I appreciate your feelings for me.

306
00:23:58,838 --> 00:24:00,162
You're still young.

307
00:24:00,295 --> 00:24:04,715
I think your feelings for me might be temporary and it won't last long.

308
00:24:05,575 --> 00:24:08,175
Because we're not compatible, and we don't understand each other.

309
00:24:08,496 --> 00:24:11,315
Are you afraid that I might not like you in the future?

310
00:24:11,423 --> 00:24:13,122
Afraid that we won't last long?

311
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:14,940
We really aren't suitable.

312
00:24:18,238 --> 00:24:20,776
I'm young, not naive.

313
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:23,413
I have my own judgment and pursuit in relationships.

314
00:24:23,513 --> 00:24:24,942
It's not just a whim.

315
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,249
You didn't say you don't have feelings for me.

316
00:24:28,273 --> 00:24:30,528
What you're saying is that we don't know each other well enough.

317
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,432
We can take our time to get to know each other.

318
00:24:32,761 --> 00:24:34,442
As for the future,

319
00:24:35,471 --> 00:24:37,820
you'll have the chance to leave me if you want.

320
00:24:40,513 --> 00:24:41,882
But I think

321
00:24:42,193 --> 00:24:43,722
in relationships,

322
00:24:44,224 --> 00:24:46,304
you can't start by thinking about the outcome first.

323
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:53,169
Right now, you just need to give me a chance to pursue and understand you.

324
00:24:53,327 --> 00:24:54,507
That's all.

325
00:25:14,392 --> 00:25:16,722
I have to take a call. You can leave now.

326
00:25:19,004 --> 00:25:21,995
I'll start getting to know you seriously from now on.

327
00:25:48,152 --> 00:25:52,182
Perhaps we shouldn't limit our focus to Zhanlan.

328
00:25:59,873 --> 00:26:01,071
Have you seen him recently?

329
00:26:01,152 --> 00:26:02,373
What is he busy with?

330
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:05,762
I haven't seen her in a long time.

331
00:26:07,433 --> 00:26:08,962
She might be busy.

332
00:26:09,392 --> 00:26:10,635
Or maybe

333
00:26:11,233 --> 00:26:12,513
she just doesn't want to see me.

334
00:26:18,845 --> 00:26:20,316
Sorry, I just finished my class.

335
00:26:23,327 --> 00:26:24,642
What are you talking about?

336
00:26:25,175 --> 00:26:27,202
Guan Ji said he hadn't seen you for a long time.

337
00:26:28,362 --> 00:26:30,162
We just had dinner together last night.

338
00:26:30,405 --> 00:26:32,645
He's been coming to see me almost every night this week.

339
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,802
Well, the days feel incredibly long without you.

340
00:26:38,989 --> 00:26:40,442
This coffee is good.

341
00:26:45,253 --> 00:26:47,082
So it's the same as what we expected.

342
00:26:47,528 --> 00:26:50,799
After Zhanlan gets the financing, they'll use it for expanding production.

343
00:26:51,304 --> 00:26:54,374
The demand for batteries in the automotive industry is constantly evolving.

344
00:26:54,545 --> 00:26:57,602
Once other battery companies achieve technological breakthroughs,

345
00:26:57,683 --> 00:26:59,911
even the car manufacturers who have had long-term cooperation with Zhanlan

346
00:26:59,935 --> 00:27:01,795
will reconsider their collaboration.

347
00:27:02,315 --> 00:27:04,972
- By that time... - We can't wait until that time.

348
00:27:05,273 --> 00:27:08,492
But if we're sure about not continuing with Zhanlan's project,

349
00:27:08,718 --> 00:27:11,318
we have to think about how to convince those old-fashioned folks.

350
00:27:11,397 --> 00:27:13,337
They'll probably still advocate for investing

351
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,351
but will hope to shorten the financing years to reduce the risk.

352
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:20,101
Maybe we don't need to convince them, just find a better option for them.

353
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:23,202
Sounds more challenging than convincing them.

354
00:27:24,713 --> 00:27:26,282
I'm almost done with that report.

355
00:27:26,434 --> 00:27:28,146
I can give it to you in the next two days.

356
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,378
What report?

357
00:27:34,592 --> 00:27:35,962
Come on, let's go for lunch.

358
00:27:36,899 --> 00:27:37,899
No.

359
00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:40,972
- Give it to me early. - What report?

360
00:27:41,166 --> 00:27:43,036
Yu You, tell me about it.

361
00:28:18,391 --> 00:28:20,751
(New discovery, new challenge.)

362
00:29:03,021 --> 00:29:04,722
Why did I unlike it?

363
00:29:06,193 --> 00:29:08,182
Zheng Shu Yi, what were you thinking?

364
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:19,610
(The flower path has never been visited by anyone.)

365
00:29:26,207 --> 00:29:28,837
"The flower path has never been visited by anyone.

366
00:29:30,312 --> 00:29:33,903
Now, the gates are open for you."

367
00:29:55,312 --> 00:29:57,082
This article is well-written.

368
00:29:57,406 --> 00:30:00,286
The editor-in-chief even called me and talked for half an hour just now.

369
00:30:01,112 --> 00:30:03,042
Once this article is published,

370
00:30:03,295 --> 00:30:05,514
do you know what kind of impact it will have?

371
00:30:07,433 --> 00:30:08,922
I know.

372
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,710
But it still needs to be published.

373
00:30:10,886 --> 00:30:12,665
When I started in this field, you told me

374
00:30:12,833 --> 00:30:14,399
to be truthful in interviews,

375
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,122
provide valuable insights,

376
00:30:16,249 --> 00:30:18,842
and be responsible to readers, the industry, and society.

377
00:30:19,193 --> 00:30:21,532
I believe this article fulfills those criteria.

378
00:30:23,302 --> 00:30:26,452
Are you using my words against me?

379
00:30:29,775 --> 00:30:32,215
If you've decided, go ahead and do it.

380
00:30:33,753 --> 00:30:36,082
Ms. Yi, aren't you angry with me?

381
00:30:36,366 --> 00:30:37,426
What?

382
00:30:38,193 --> 00:30:41,093
Only you have professional aspirations? I don't have one, is it?

383
00:30:42,012 --> 00:30:45,442
Don't forget who told you those things.

384
00:30:47,473 --> 00:30:49,162
Then I'll send it to them for formatting.

385
00:30:59,252 --> 00:31:00,413
Hello, Guan.

386
00:31:00,508 --> 00:31:02,802
(Have you departed? Do you want me to pick you up?)

387
00:31:04,783 --> 00:31:07,453
No need, I drove today.

388
00:31:07,861 --> 00:31:09,202
Next time, then.

389
00:31:16,493 --> 00:31:18,193
- It's done. - Thanks.

390
00:31:20,685 --> 00:31:22,125
Hello, how can I help you?

391
00:31:22,206 --> 00:31:24,341
Hello, I'm Zheng Shu Yi, a journalist from Financial Introduce.

392
00:31:24,365 --> 00:31:27,325
- I'm here to see Mr. Qiu from Finance Department. - One moment. please.

393
00:31:35,135 --> 00:31:38,056
(Le Le. Financial Introduce's journalist has an appointment with Mr. Qiu.)

394
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,362
(She's already here.)

395
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:41,944
- What's her name? - (Her name is Zheng Shu Yi.)

396
00:31:43,847 --> 00:31:45,177
Okay, got it.

397
00:31:45,335 --> 00:31:46,695
Mr. Qiu is in a meeting now.

398
00:31:46,793 --> 00:31:48,802
Arrange for her to wait at the reception area.

399
00:31:48,886 --> 00:31:50,147
(Okay, Le Le.)

400
00:31:55,282 --> 00:31:57,242
Miss Zheng, please wait here for a moment.

401
00:31:57,323 --> 00:31:58,370
Mr. Qiu is in a meeting.

402
00:31:58,451 --> 00:32:00,836
- Someone will take you to meet him shortly. - Thanks.

403
00:32:59,173 --> 00:33:02,282
Hello, is Mr. Qiu done with the meeting?

404
00:33:02,401 --> 00:33:05,002
- Let me check for you. - Thank you.

405
00:33:14,187 --> 00:33:15,246
Miss Zheng?

406
00:33:16,291 --> 00:33:18,072
It's really you. What brought you here?

407
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,682
I'm here to see Mr. Qiu. He's in a meeting.

408
00:33:24,352 --> 00:33:27,682
I see, I'll go get busy now.

409
00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:38,042
How long has she been waiting?

410
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:41,082
I noticed she's had several cups of coffee already.

411
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,580
Then when I came up, I asked about it.

412
00:33:43,727 --> 00:33:45,996
Mr. Qiu doesn't have any meetings in the afternoon.

413
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,873
- Okay. - Mr. Shi.

414
00:33:50,976 --> 00:33:51,995
Go out first.

415
00:33:52,513 --> 00:33:53,513
Okay.

416
00:34:05,421 --> 00:34:08,442
May I know if you're Miss Zheng?

417
00:34:09,433 --> 00:34:12,208
Hello, Mr. Qiu, I'm Zheng Shu Yi, a journalist from Financial Introduce.

418
00:34:12,232 --> 00:34:14,070
Hello, I'm really sorry.

419
00:34:14,151 --> 00:34:16,382
It was my secretary's oversight that made you wait for so long.

420
00:34:16,406 --> 00:34:19,288
- It's okay. - Please come to my office.

421
00:34:19,375 --> 00:34:20,375
Okay.

422
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:26,602
(Yunchuang employees, especially senior executives, should be punctual.)

423
00:34:26,734 --> 00:34:28,322
I understand.

424
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:29,892
(The interview with Financial Introduce)

425
00:34:29,916 --> 00:34:31,916
is to help the public understand Yunchuang better.

426
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:33,554
Don't let the media know that

427
00:34:33,635 --> 00:34:36,122
I have to remind you to handle such a trivial matter properly.

428
00:34:36,667 --> 00:34:38,193
The relevant materials that you requested have been prepared

429
00:34:38,217 --> 00:34:39,603
according to Mr. Shi...

430
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:42,072
Have been prepared according to your requests.

431
00:34:42,152 --> 00:34:45,122
- Thank you, sorry for the trouble. - Don't mention it.

432
00:34:49,953 --> 00:34:51,253
(Qin Le Zhi?)

433
00:34:51,551 --> 00:34:53,739
(So Shi Yan arranged for her to work in the finance department.)

434
00:34:53,763 --> 00:34:54,863
This way.

435
00:35:01,193 --> 00:35:02,294
Here.

436
00:35:04,392 --> 00:35:06,722
Why would Qiu Fu pick her up personally?

437
00:35:07,434 --> 00:35:08,762
Here.

438
00:35:09,032 --> 00:35:10,753
Thank you, Mr. Qiu. Sorry to trouble you.

439
00:35:10,873 --> 00:35:12,419
Next time you come, just contact me directly.

440
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,364
I'll arrange everything personally and wait for you here.

441
00:35:14,388 --> 00:35:15,762
That's very kind of you.

442
00:35:15,849 --> 00:35:17,209
- I'll get going now. - Sure, goodbye.

443
00:35:17,233 --> 00:35:18,233
Goodbye.

444
00:35:28,429 --> 00:35:30,448
Mr. Shi, Miss Zheng has left.

445
00:35:40,421 --> 00:35:41,801
Come to my office.

446
00:35:46,134 --> 00:35:48,164
Mr. Qiu, you want to see me?

447
00:35:49,192 --> 00:35:52,202
I had an appointment with the journalist from Financial Introduce at 3 pm.

448
00:35:52,375 --> 00:35:54,765
Why did you reschedule my meeting with the bank earlier?

449
00:35:55,456 --> 00:35:57,965
She came and waited for so long, and you didn't inform me.

450
00:35:58,953 --> 00:36:00,082
Qin.

451
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:02,170
You've been working for me for quite some time.

452
00:36:02,222 --> 00:36:04,333
You usually pay great attention to details.

453
00:36:05,632 --> 00:36:07,462
How could you make such a mistake?

454
00:36:08,073 --> 00:36:10,711
I thought the bank meeting was more important.

455
00:36:10,792 --> 00:36:12,819
I figured the interview with Financial Introduce wasn't urgent.

456
00:36:12,843 --> 00:36:15,722
That's why I adjusted the timing for you.

457
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,940
You thought?

458
00:36:17,149 --> 00:36:18,330
You figured?

459
00:36:18,433 --> 00:36:20,313
Can you understand your position?

460
00:36:20,393 --> 00:36:22,138
You don't even know who is important or not,

461
00:36:22,162 --> 00:36:23,641
yet you simply changed my schedule!

462
00:36:25,673 --> 00:36:30,284
I remember you said the bank is an important client.

463
00:36:30,913 --> 00:36:33,979
She's just a journalist. She should wait for you.

464
00:36:34,271 --> 00:36:37,111
If she was in a hurry, our PR department could prepare materials, so...

465
00:36:37,158 --> 00:36:39,798
- So... - So, how about you take my job as the director instead?

466
00:36:39,833 --> 00:36:41,838
Is Zheng Shu Yi an ordinary journalist?

467
00:36:41,919 --> 00:36:43,282
Do you know who she is?

468
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:45,547
Is this as simple as you thought?

469
00:36:45,969 --> 00:36:47,189
Sorry, Mr. Qiu.

470
00:36:48,353 --> 00:36:51,122
This time, it's my fault. It won't happen again next time.

471
00:36:51,244 --> 00:36:53,915
Next time? Next time you don't need to see me either.

472
00:36:56,635 --> 00:36:57,694
Get out.

473
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,140
Zheng Shu Yi.

474
00:37:11,004 --> 00:37:12,183
It's you again.

475
00:37:15,192 --> 00:37:17,823
Qiu Fu said she's not an ordinary journalist.

476
00:37:18,674 --> 00:37:20,869
Not an ordinary journalist?

477
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:22,313
Who is she then?

478
00:37:48,213 --> 00:37:50,704
Miss Zheng, are you waiting for the next elevator?

479
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,482
(What is he doing here?)

480
00:38:20,526 --> 00:38:22,042
(I forgot to press the button.)

481
00:38:29,528 --> 00:38:30,667
Hello, Mr. Shi.

482
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:35,893
Hello, Mr. Shi.

483
00:38:37,942 --> 00:38:40,402
What's going on? Who is this?

484
00:38:54,224 --> 00:38:56,384
(He pulled me over but he didn't say anything.)

485
00:38:56,605 --> 00:38:58,622
(What a good way to maintain a certain level of ambiguity.)

486
00:38:58,646 --> 00:39:00,824
(Shi Yan, you're really good at this.)

487
00:39:23,479 --> 00:39:25,442
Thank you. You're so considerate.

488
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:26,963
You're welcome.

489
00:39:43,192 --> 00:39:45,162
(Look how considerate she is.)

490
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:48,429
(Unlike some people who don't know anything about hospitality.)

491
00:40:37,027 --> 00:40:38,027
Mr. Chen.

492
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:39,339
Miss Zheng.

493
00:40:39,873 --> 00:40:41,202
Is there anything you need?

494
00:40:41,353 --> 00:40:44,813
I want to prepare warm lemon water with a bit of honey for Mr. Shi.

495
00:40:45,088 --> 00:40:47,703
Mr. Shi doesn't drink honey.

496
00:40:47,877 --> 00:40:50,227
And we didn't prepare that in the company either.

497
00:40:52,072 --> 00:40:53,322
How come?

498
00:40:54,192 --> 00:40:56,002
That drink was specially prepared for you

499
00:40:56,083 --> 00:40:58,883
because Mr. Shi knew you had been drinking a lot of coffee downstairs.

500
00:41:00,154 --> 00:41:02,105
He knew I was downstairs all along?

501
00:41:02,873 --> 00:41:06,183
He knew you had been waiting for a long time and even called Mr. Qiu.

502
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,442
Thank you.

503
00:41:13,149 --> 00:41:15,619
You're welcome. I just casually mentioned it to him.

504
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:19,522
Please help me prepare a cup of warm lemon water.

505
00:41:19,652 --> 00:41:21,072
Okay, please wait a moment.

506
00:41:53,819 --> 00:41:56,038
I splashed the drink on you. I'm sorry.

507
00:41:56,455 --> 00:41:57,514
It's okay.

508
00:41:58,277 --> 00:42:00,002
Is your work done?

509
00:42:00,514 --> 00:42:01,613
No.

510
00:42:02,589 --> 00:42:04,658
What were you going to do just now?

511
00:42:27,777 --> 00:42:29,482
I suddenly felt like having coffee.

512
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:32,931
Don't drink coffee. Have a cup of warm water instead.

513
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:35,990
Okay.

514
00:42:43,308 --> 00:42:45,162
You have to wait for me a little longer.

515
00:42:46,117 --> 00:42:47,162
Okay.
