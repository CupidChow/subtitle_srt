1
00:01:31,442 --> 00:01:36,082
(Only For Love)

2
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:39,122
(Episode 11)

3
00:01:40,462 --> 00:01:42,611
Hi, may I know who ordered this?

4
00:01:43,013 --> 00:01:44,202
Here.

5
00:01:50,204 --> 00:01:51,864
Well, someone here wants cake.

6
00:01:55,297 --> 00:01:59,202
(Shi Yan, I can't believe you're subtly mocking me here.)

7
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,962
Hurry up and eat.

8
00:02:37,445 --> 00:02:39,419
Wait for me. I'm going to say hi to Uncle Cheng.

9
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,762
Okay.

10
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,319
Looks like Shi Yan finally found a new girlfriend.

11
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,280
I heard that he was devastated after Bei Lin dumped him.

12
00:02:48,404 --> 00:02:49,904
That's why he left Mingyu.

13
00:02:50,064 --> 00:02:53,923
That's how the nickname "Mingyu Runaway Prince" came about.

14
00:02:54,059 --> 00:02:55,260
That's not right.

15
00:02:55,348 --> 00:02:57,311
Shi Yan left Mingyu at the most critical time.

16
00:02:57,392 --> 00:02:59,832
Bei Lin dumped him because she thought he wasn't responsible.

17
00:03:00,899 --> 00:03:02,339
Do you think that girl

18
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,861
knows all the things that happened to Shi Yan?

19
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,760
Why does it matter?

20
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,270
Everyone takes what they need.

21
00:03:08,393 --> 00:03:11,388
Do you think the girl fell for Shi Yan solely because of his handsome looks

22
00:03:11,412 --> 00:03:13,792
and not his background or wealth?

23
00:03:13,965 --> 00:03:15,282
Makes sense.

24
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:23,169
When did you come back?

25
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,162
Just now.

26
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,100
Really? Just now?

27
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,020
What's up? Do you want to eat or drink something?

28
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:40,562
I'm tired. Let's go back.

29
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,482
Let's go.

30
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:54,499
Let's send Miss Zheng home first.

31
00:03:54,619 --> 00:03:55,922
Okay, Mr. Shi.

32
00:04:03,963 --> 00:04:07,322
Looks like Shi Yan finally found a new girlfriend.

33
00:04:07,403 --> 00:04:10,263
What does it have to do with you if he finds a girlfriend?

34
00:04:10,956 --> 00:04:13,556
I heard that he was devastated after Bei Lin dumped him.

35
00:04:13,692 --> 00:04:15,092
That's why he left Mingyu.

36
00:04:15,173 --> 00:04:16,773
What kind of nonsense are you talking?

37
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,000
He was full of ambition and left to start his own business.

38
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:24,280
That's how the nickname "Mingyu Runaway Prince" came about.

39
00:04:24,385 --> 00:04:26,642
Did you see him run away with your own eyes?

40
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,880
Can't you see him?

41
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,198
That's not right. The version I heard was Shi Yan left Mingyu

42
00:04:31,222 --> 00:04:32,397
at the most critical time.

43
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:35,179
Bei Lin dumped him because she thought he wasn't responsible.

44
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,339
Did you hide under his bed?

45
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,060
How did you know who was being dumped?

46
00:04:39,141 --> 00:04:41,564
What do you mean by not responsible? He was obviously shouldering

47
00:04:41,588 --> 00:04:43,548
the responsibility of the whole Mingyu Yunchuang.

48
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,419
Do you think that girl

49
00:04:46,539 --> 00:04:49,159
knows all the things that happened to Shi Yan?

50
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,219
That's none of your business.

51
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,260
What does it matter?

52
00:04:54,356 --> 00:04:55,935
Everyone takes what they need.

53
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:58,299
Do you think that girl fell for Shi Yan solely

54
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,541
because of his handsome looks

55
00:04:59,622 --> 00:05:01,942
and not his background or wealth?

56
00:05:02,023 --> 00:05:03,523
I don't believe it.

57
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,120
Why can't I fall for Shi Yan's handsome looks?

58
00:05:07,252 --> 00:05:10,313
Even if I'm after his money, what does it have to do with you?

59
00:05:32,226 --> 00:05:34,124
Thanks for treating me to dinner today, Mr. Shi.

60
00:05:34,148 --> 00:05:35,648
I'm going home first.

61
00:05:43,296 --> 00:05:44,682
Zheng Shu Yi.

62
00:05:50,692 --> 00:05:52,922
I'm calling you. Didn't you hear me?

63
00:05:53,899 --> 00:05:55,399
I heard you.

64
00:05:56,221 --> 00:05:57,721
Are you in such a hurry to go home?

65
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,562
No, not really.

66
00:06:01,732 --> 00:06:05,282
Are you in a hurry to go home to bake small cakes?

67
00:06:07,413 --> 00:06:08,913
Shi Yan.

68
00:06:09,308 --> 00:06:10,967
You're so annoying.

69
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:17,602
You stopped me just to say that?

70
00:06:17,932 --> 00:06:19,472
What else do you want to hear?

71
00:06:24,398 --> 00:06:25,898
Why aren't you happy?

72
00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:30,762
Nothing.

73
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:35,976
So, what did you gain from tonight's dinner?

74
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:41,479
I did hear some things about you, Mr. Shi.

75
00:06:45,579 --> 00:06:48,562
So, do you believe it?

76
00:06:51,755 --> 00:06:53,255
Of course, I don't.

77
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,720
I only believe what you tell me.

78
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,751
So, do you want to know more about me?

79
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,002
Can't I?

80
00:07:15,219 --> 00:07:17,369
So, you're not in a hurry to go home.

81
00:07:18,758 --> 00:07:20,122
I'm not in a hurry.

82
00:07:44,917 --> 00:07:46,602
What do you want me to say?

83
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,840
Isn't what they said quite complete?

84
00:07:48,956 --> 00:07:50,836
My past experiences,

85
00:07:50,917 --> 00:07:52,562
from life to work,

86
00:07:52,651 --> 00:07:54,151
they talked about everything.

87
00:07:56,693 --> 00:07:59,402
(So, he heard it all.)

88
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,759
Did they hide under your table or under your bed?

89
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,881
How could they know everything about you?

90
00:08:09,092 --> 00:08:13,051
If we can judge a person just by hearsay and a few meetings,

91
00:08:13,219 --> 00:08:15,539
then I can also say, in my eyes,

92
00:08:15,619 --> 00:08:17,140
you are a wise and far-sighted,

93
00:08:17,253 --> 00:08:19,753
excellent and handsome young entrepreneur.

94
00:08:25,891 --> 00:08:27,881
I wouldn't know that if you didn't say it.

95
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,194
So, I'm so excellent in your eyes?

96
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:35,611
I'm just giving an example.

97
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:37,336
It's not clear to me who you really are.

98
00:08:44,372 --> 00:08:45,953
Is it clearer now?

99
00:09:18,972 --> 00:09:20,593
You can't park here.

100
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,880
Miss Zheng, are you okay?

101
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,362
I'm fine.

102
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,289
(Please enter the password.)

103
00:10:03,053 --> 00:10:04,592
(Door is opened.)

104
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:22,322
Seven.

105
00:10:24,669 --> 00:10:26,328
Don't stand there. Hurry up and go.

106
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,980
Mr. Shi, do I need to send the clothes in the trunk to Miss Zheng?

107
00:10:33,652 --> 00:10:35,482
No need. Let's go.

108
00:10:57,644 --> 00:10:59,484
(Shu Yi, what are you talking about?)

109
00:10:59,573 --> 00:11:00,933
(Have you been drinking too much?)

110
00:11:00,979 --> 00:11:02,842
(Shu Yi, are you okay?)

111
00:11:05,884 --> 00:11:07,045
(What's wrong with you?)

112
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,915
(Don't you know that lightning could strike you)

113
00:11:08,939 --> 00:11:10,519
(for disturbing people so late?)

114
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:26,804
You did well.

115
00:11:26,913 --> 00:11:30,413
You must let him know that there are other guys who are after you.

116
00:11:30,999 --> 00:11:33,802
Don't you see that he's falling for it?

117
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,882
Otherwise, why would he be implying things to you, all right?

118
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,941
I guess he will dream of you tonight.

119
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,880
(But you must not give him any response.)

120
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,359
We should keep him guessing.

121
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:51,539
Let him take the initiative to find and chase you.

122
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:52,810
Listen to me.

123
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,562
Don't worry about what he thinks of you.

124
00:11:55,844 --> 00:11:57,205
What is the nature of men?

125
00:11:57,325 --> 00:11:58,962
It's conquering.

126
00:11:59,243 --> 00:12:01,963
If you don't have someone chasing you, or if you're too easy to get,

127
00:12:02,003 --> 00:12:03,824
(he won't treasure you.)

128
00:12:03,927 --> 00:12:06,637
You have to find a way to make him take the initiative.

129
00:12:07,348 --> 00:12:09,962
What for you pursue him unilaterally?

130
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,120
(Then, what?)

131
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,002
Then...

132
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,215
Then, I called you.

133
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,279
Nothing happened after that?

134
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,322
So, he sent you home.

135
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:36,610
(But nothing happened between you two.)

136
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,439
Then, I went home.

137
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,720
All right then. I won't chat with you now.

138
00:12:50,995 --> 00:12:52,495
I still have something to do here.

139
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,620
(Wait and see.)

140
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,279
(Keep a distance.)

141
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,880
Wine is not bad.

142
00:13:31,886 --> 00:13:33,626
The wine glass is too cold.

143
00:13:36,619 --> 00:13:38,139
You have so many tricks.

144
00:13:38,252 --> 00:13:40,212
Aren't you afraid someone will be sincere to you?

145
00:13:43,403 --> 00:13:44,903
It's best not to.

146
00:13:56,604 --> 00:13:58,216
He can't get out of it.

147
00:14:15,077 --> 00:14:16,116
You...

148
00:14:16,244 --> 00:14:17,405
What's wrong?

149
00:14:17,485 --> 00:14:18,985
Nothing.

150
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,880
I'm fine.

151
00:14:40,635 --> 00:14:42,135
What are you doing?

152
00:14:42,652 --> 00:14:44,336
Let me get changed. I'll take you to the hospital.

153
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,722
I'm not going.

154
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:47,785
It's swollen.

155
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,301
I have an appointment tomorrow.

156
00:14:57,843 --> 00:14:58,843
Hello?

157
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,460
Send me some band-aids. I...

158
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:22,482
Unilateral efforts are indeed meaningless.

159
00:15:24,819 --> 00:15:26,602
With what happened today,

160
00:15:26,819 --> 00:15:29,080
I don't even know what he wants.

161
00:15:31,011 --> 00:15:32,171
Actually, everyone knows that

162
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,531
more efficient and safer batteries are always

163
00:15:34,612 --> 00:15:37,045
the pain points for the development of the new energy vehicle industry.

164
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:40,725
So, finding a battery enterprise with potential for long-term development

165
00:15:40,876 --> 00:15:43,642
is the most important key for us to enter this line of business.

166
00:15:44,132 --> 00:15:46,771
Zhanlan's market share is high now.

167
00:15:46,852 --> 00:15:48,214
After this round of financing,

168
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,095
it will definitely go up another level.

169
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,980
Zhanlan is indeed a good choice,

170
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,364
but the competition is fierce.

171
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,701
Many companies are now confident of their success.

172
00:15:58,515 --> 00:16:01,395
Zhanlan is in a leading position in the industry,

173
00:16:01,499 --> 00:16:03,259
but can they break through

174
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,460
the technical difficulty of all-solid-state batteries

175
00:16:05,595 --> 00:16:07,156
and continue to lead the industry?

176
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:11,802
Mr. Shi, it's definitely right to have a long-term vision.

177
00:16:12,093 --> 00:16:15,933
But there is no better choice than Zhanlan right now.

178
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:19,440
Are you a bit too pessimistic?

179
00:16:26,722 --> 00:16:28,097
What does the Evaluation Department think?

180
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:31,641
It is indeed risky for Yunchuang to make such a large investment.

181
00:16:31,819 --> 00:16:34,162
But we have done detailed calculations.

182
00:16:34,271 --> 00:16:36,351
Based on Zhanlan's current profitability,

183
00:16:36,457 --> 00:16:38,977
we believe it is a worthwhile investment opportunity.

184
00:16:39,912 --> 00:16:42,991
The prospects for solid-state batteries are indeed very promising.

185
00:16:43,178 --> 00:16:44,955
But the research and development cycle is long

186
00:16:44,979 --> 00:16:46,402
and the cost is huge,

187
00:16:46,494 --> 00:16:47,933
so we need to be careful.

188
00:16:48,023 --> 00:16:49,742
If we want to take down Zhanlan,

189
00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:51,962
we still need to do more work.

190
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:55,340
But I think we can still try our best.

191
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,720
Everybody, Zhanlan is at the forefront of solid-state battery innovation.

192
00:16:58,828 --> 00:17:00,105
With our help,

193
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:02,751
it is possible to quickly pull away from other companies

194
00:17:02,832 --> 00:17:04,698
and become the industry leader.

195
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,282
So I'm very optimistic about it.

196
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:10,482
But since Mr. Shi has concerns,

197
00:17:10,688 --> 00:17:12,889
we can shorten the investment cycle.

198
00:17:13,012 --> 00:17:14,512
We can cash out quickly.

199
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,034
Since everyone is optimistic about this line of business,

200
00:17:25,058 --> 00:17:27,720
let's keep pushing forward the research and evaluation work

201
00:17:27,825 --> 00:17:29,926
to determine the direction for the next step.

202
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,619
Let's end it here for today. Dismissed.

203
00:17:37,793 --> 00:17:40,573
Uncle Tian and Uncle Zhang are acting a bit strange today.

204
00:17:41,262 --> 00:17:42,741
It's not hard to understand.

205
00:17:42,822 --> 00:17:45,543
Short-term large investments may bring high returns.

206
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,482
No investment company would give up this opportunity.

207
00:17:48,563 --> 00:17:50,983
That's why we have so many competitors.

208
00:17:51,629 --> 00:17:53,539
That's their true face.

209
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,281
Zhanlan is the leader in the semi-solid battery field.

210
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,080
I've seen the report. They do have a lot of orders.

211
00:18:00,214 --> 00:18:03,570
But their factories are all producing at an overload.

212
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,400
So, I guess the investment they got this round

213
00:18:06,526 --> 00:18:09,206
will be spent on expanding production

214
00:18:09,316 --> 00:18:11,356
rather than on technology research and development.

215
00:18:12,454 --> 00:18:13,727
This possibility is very high.

216
00:18:13,832 --> 00:18:15,769
After all, maintaining and expanding market shares

217
00:18:15,793 --> 00:18:17,613
is the primary goal for many companies.

218
00:18:19,629 --> 00:18:21,369
What's the next step?

219
00:18:22,565 --> 00:18:24,366
The report is all about the past.

220
00:18:24,486 --> 00:18:26,926
I need to see the current situation with my own eyes.

221
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:29,282
So, I'll go and investigate in person.

222
00:18:29,459 --> 00:18:30,602
Shi Yan.

223
00:18:31,472 --> 00:18:32,962
I have an idea.

224
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,820
We can start preparing.

225
00:18:39,421 --> 00:18:41,601
No. What are you two talking about?

226
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:43,322
Shi Yan.

227
00:18:44,147 --> 00:18:46,341
(Yi, have you eaten?)

228
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:48,768
(How have you been lately?)

229
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,260
(Are you busy with work?)

230
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,642
It's okay.

231
00:18:52,101 --> 00:18:54,410
(Do you have time this weekend?)

232
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,501
Mom, why do I feel like something's off with you?

233
00:18:58,911 --> 00:19:01,642
Nothing's off with me. No manners!

234
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,883
I'm just concerned about you.

235
00:19:03,969 --> 00:19:06,929
(You're concerned about the future, the things that haven't happened yet.)

236
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:10,050
As the saying goes,

237
00:19:10,131 --> 00:19:11,932
don't be too attached to the past.

238
00:19:12,013 --> 00:19:16,003
(The future is what we should really cherish.)

239
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:17,661
Yi.

240
00:19:17,758 --> 00:19:20,361
Do you still remember what I told you last time

241
00:19:20,442 --> 00:19:22,282
about the son of our dean,

242
00:19:22,383 --> 00:19:24,402
(the one who studied abroad)

243
00:19:24,501 --> 00:19:26,642
(and is now back in Jiangcheng?)

244
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,922
Why don't you go and meet him this weekend,

245
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:31,865
get to know him, and then hang out together?

246
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,802
Are you trying to arrange a date for me?

247
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,282
(Not at all.)

248
00:19:37,391 --> 00:19:39,171
It's just making friends.

249
00:19:39,548 --> 00:19:42,148
Don't young people nowadays prefer

250
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,583
socializing online and then going out?

251
00:19:44,739 --> 00:19:45,819
(Listen.)

252
00:19:45,939 --> 00:19:48,282
(This boy is quite handsome.)

253
00:19:48,494 --> 00:19:52,274
I'm not doing this because of his education or family background.

254
00:19:52,934 --> 00:19:55,253
So, you're doing this because of his looks.

255
00:19:55,388 --> 00:19:56,708
(If you like him, )

256
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:58,522
(just go out with him.)

257
00:19:58,692 --> 00:20:01,134
Why do you talk to your mom like this?

258
00:20:01,238 --> 00:20:02,682
No manners.

259
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,780
Yi.

260
00:20:04,861 --> 00:20:06,221
You're still young.

261
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,060
You can't stay single for too long.

262
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:10,306
(Staying single for too long will become a habit.)

263
00:20:10,387 --> 00:20:13,082
(Your love life will go downhill.)

264
00:20:13,277 --> 00:20:16,146
I'm giving you advice.

265
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,482
I really don't need it.

266
00:20:19,632 --> 00:20:22,533
(So, say it. What kind of guys do you like?)

267
00:20:25,348 --> 00:20:26,548
He has to be older than me,

268
00:20:26,668 --> 00:20:28,109
at least 27.

269
00:20:28,249 --> 00:20:30,642
(Not too tall, but not too short either, )

270
00:20:30,723 --> 00:20:32,162
around 183 cm.

271
00:20:32,376 --> 00:20:35,196
It's best if he works in finance, so we'll have things to talk about.

272
00:20:35,997 --> 00:20:39,187
Coincidentally, he fits your requirements perfectly.

273
00:20:40,659 --> 00:20:41,962
No way!

274
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,400
Don't tell me that his name is made up of two characters too.

275
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,142
You guessed it right!

276
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,760
(I'm sending his WeChat to you now.)

277
00:20:51,924 --> 00:20:52,925
Add him.

278
00:20:53,006 --> 00:20:54,886
There are pictures on his WeChat.

279
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,200
Take a look and you'll know

280
00:20:56,326 --> 00:20:58,236
if what I said about him is accurate.

281
00:20:58,581 --> 00:21:00,701
(If you don't think you guys are suitable...)

282
00:21:00,817 --> 00:21:02,818
Can you just stop introducing guys to me again?

283
00:21:02,907 --> 00:21:04,376
Oh, it's all right if it's not suitable.

284
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,881
I will keep introducing

285
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:09,010
(until you're satisfied.)

286
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,239
(How about it? Is it good?)

287
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,042
All right then.

288
00:21:24,123 --> 00:21:25,902
I'm going to meet a new friend then.

289
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,381
As I told you, this guy is pretty good, right?

290
00:21:28,462 --> 00:21:30,651
Remember to go to the meeting on the weekend, alright?

291
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,322
Meeting.

292
00:21:33,576 --> 00:21:36,037
Mom, I'm hanging up now. I have to go to a meeting.

293
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:40,930
Shu Yi.

294
00:21:41,269 --> 00:21:42,508
Yu Ling.

295
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,082
You two have attended Yunchuang's press conference before.

296
00:21:45,256 --> 00:21:48,729
The year-end cover for next month will be entrusted to you two.

297
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:50,730
I hope you two can work together

298
00:21:50,931 --> 00:21:53,922
to give Financial Introduce a good ending this year.

299
00:21:59,749 --> 00:22:01,249
That's settled then.

300
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,541
Shu Yi, you're in charge of finalizing the article.

301
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,330
Do you two have any other questions?

302
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,842
No.

303
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,020
Everyone has been doing great lately.

304
00:22:12,101 --> 00:22:13,421
Keep up the good work.

305
00:22:13,502 --> 00:22:15,461
There are only two more issues left this year.

306
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:16,700
Don't slack off.

307
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,070
Put in more effort. Then, have a great new year ahead.

308
00:22:20,219 --> 00:22:21,882
All right. Dismissed.

309
00:22:26,269 --> 00:22:27,348
Shu Yi.

310
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,929
Come to my office.

311
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:38,239
You've been doing well lately.

312
00:22:38,511 --> 00:22:40,682
The editor-in-chief and I have high hopes for you.

313
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:43,832
The deputy editor position has been empty for a while.

314
00:22:43,924 --> 00:22:45,162
Work hard

315
00:22:45,644 --> 00:22:47,084
and try to surpass me.

316
00:22:47,243 --> 00:22:49,700
Ms. Yi, you know that this is not my end goal.

317
00:22:49,844 --> 00:22:50,964
Shu Yi.

318
00:22:51,076 --> 00:22:52,636
No matter what form it takes,

319
00:22:52,749 --> 00:22:54,419
the most important thing is the article itself.

320
00:22:54,443 --> 00:22:56,643
A good article is the same no matter where it's placed.

321
00:22:56,961 --> 00:22:59,162
But articles and interviews have time limits.

322
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:01,267
Interaction with the readers is also important.

323
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,539
The editor-in-chief has his own considerations.

324
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,136
Regarding the current state of print media,

325
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,227
we in Financial Introduce have already made our calculations.

326
00:23:08,251 --> 00:23:09,939
If we add more people and budget,

327
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,819
it would be difficult for him.

328
00:23:11,915 --> 00:23:15,322
This is exactly why I want to promote a digital magazine.

329
00:23:15,426 --> 00:23:17,882
I want to meet the readers' needs and reading habits.

330
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:19,882
It might be a new way out.

331
00:23:20,596 --> 00:23:22,035
I understand your point.

332
00:23:22,132 --> 00:23:25,322
But the reality is that Financial Introduce is a monthly magazine.

333
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:27,231
Our current structure is just right.

334
00:23:27,311 --> 00:23:30,220
If we put all our energy into the digital magazine,

335
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,661
we would need a lot of articles,

336
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:33,996
and we would need more manpower and financial resources

337
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,539
to make it happen.

338
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,922
I get it.

339
00:23:37,636 --> 00:23:39,476
That's why I wanted to try it.

340
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,837
I can write articles for both paper and digital magazines.

341
00:23:41,861 --> 00:23:43,901
I can do both with the current team.

342
00:23:43,982 --> 00:23:45,595
Finish the work for this year first.

343
00:23:45,676 --> 00:23:48,220
Then, think carefully about the new-year cover next year.

344
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:49,356
If you do it well,

345
00:23:49,436 --> 00:23:52,772
I will try to talk to the editor-in-chief about the digital magazine.

346
00:23:54,325 --> 00:23:55,722
Thank you, Ms. Yi.

347
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,602
Professor Yu.

348
00:24:13,498 --> 00:24:15,609
I didn't expect you to be my date.

349
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,042
Shu Yi.

350
00:24:17,594 --> 00:24:18,729
Sit.

351
00:24:22,082 --> 00:24:25,449
So, you already knew that I was your date?

352
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,230
As soon as I saw it was you I felt relieved immediately.

353
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,250
You even dressed up.

354
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,461
Since it's a date with a professor, I had to dress up

355
00:24:38,568 --> 00:24:40,107
at least out of respect.

356
00:24:40,308 --> 00:24:41,338
Since you knew it was me,

357
00:24:41,419 --> 00:24:43,402
why didn't you tell me earlier through WeChat?

358
00:24:43,996 --> 00:24:45,535
My mom is a crafty one.

359
00:24:45,636 --> 00:24:46,700
If I had talked to you,

360
00:24:46,781 --> 00:24:48,762
she would have asked to see the chat log,

361
00:24:48,843 --> 00:24:51,323
and then she would have known that we already knew each other.

362
00:24:51,739 --> 00:24:53,635
What would you like to drink? I'll order for you.

363
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,002
Anything is fine.

364
00:24:55,219 --> 00:24:56,442
Waitress.

365
00:25:30,085 --> 00:25:31,445
(Does it look good?)

366
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:33,442
(Give me a two-word answer.)

367
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:35,842
(Looks okay.)

368
00:25:42,895 --> 00:25:45,800
(When will you come and take your things back?)

369
00:25:52,729 --> 00:25:54,652
Shu Yi. It's already this late.

370
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,340
Let's have lunch together later.

371
00:25:57,259 --> 00:25:59,242
It's okay. I'm not hungry yet.

372
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,540
I still have something to do later.

373
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,340
I'll make an appointment with you next time.

374
00:26:04,979 --> 00:26:06,162
Okay.

375
00:26:17,797 --> 00:26:20,162
(What did I forget to bring back with me?)

376
00:26:20,596 --> 00:26:22,002
(Mr. Shi.)

377
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:28,322
(Are you talking about my heart?)

378
00:26:33,457 --> 00:26:36,482
(The clothes you bought the day we went to the banquet.)

379
00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:41,999
I forgot all about it.

380
00:26:42,784 --> 00:26:45,485
Oh, snap. I can't return it if I wait any longer.

381
00:26:46,356 --> 00:26:47,682
(I've been too busy lately.)

382
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,082
(I forgot.)

383
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:51,842
(Can you help me deliver it, please?)

384
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,226
(I need it urgently.)

385
00:26:53,307 --> 00:26:54,882
(Pretty please.)

386
00:27:03,076 --> 00:27:04,315
(I'm also very busy lately.)

387
00:27:04,396 --> 00:27:05,896
(I have no time to be a courier.)

388
00:27:16,836 --> 00:27:18,197
(What are you busy with?)

389
00:27:18,445 --> 00:27:19,762
(Making desserts?)

390
00:27:25,601 --> 00:27:27,631
Is this joke never going to go away?

391
00:27:32,381 --> 00:27:34,461
(I'll go get it now.)

392
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,362
(Wait for me.)

393
00:27:39,033 --> 00:27:41,362
Excuse me, sir. I want to go to another place.

394
00:27:41,457 --> 00:27:42,802
Okay.

395
00:28:11,499 --> 00:28:12,682
Yue.

396
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,884
Give your uncle a call.

397
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:16,482
Okay.

398
00:28:36,899 --> 00:28:38,461
- Hello? - (Uncle.)

399
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,602
(Dinner is ready. When are you coming back?)

400
00:28:40,738 --> 00:28:43,290
You guys go ahead and eat. I won't be coming back.

401
00:28:45,707 --> 00:28:48,602
Come back after you're done with your work. We can wait for you.

402
00:28:48,752 --> 00:28:50,202
It doesn't matter how late.

403
00:28:50,675 --> 00:28:51,996
You and Grandpa eat first.

404
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,339
I have something to do.

405
00:28:53,521 --> 00:28:55,552
(But you need to eat too.)

406
00:28:57,659 --> 00:28:59,159
I'm already cooking.

407
00:28:59,452 --> 00:29:01,653
Grandpa. Uncle said he's already cooking.

408
00:29:01,761 --> 00:29:04,440
- He won't be coming back for dinner. - Give me the phone.

409
00:29:05,467 --> 00:29:06,682
Shi Yan.

410
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:10,520
You haven't been home for dinner for quite a few days.

411
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,530
Dad, I'll make time to come back in two days.

412
00:29:13,659 --> 00:29:14,819
(I heard)

413
00:29:14,954 --> 00:29:18,689
you've been seeing a female actress recently.

414
00:29:20,482 --> 00:29:22,122
Who told you that?

415
00:29:22,259 --> 00:29:25,159
You can't find the source for most rumors.

416
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:28,242
Just answer me. Yes or no?

417
00:29:31,524 --> 00:29:34,123
No. She just wants to show off a bit.

418
00:29:34,321 --> 00:29:35,842
(Dad, I'm hanging up now.)

419
00:29:35,923 --> 00:29:37,423
(Something happened.)

420
00:29:38,774 --> 00:29:41,722
Grandpa. Uncle is really in love.

421
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,922
Done with work? Where did you come from?

422
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,922
Come in.

423
00:31:07,964 --> 00:31:09,682
So many dishes!

424
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,362
(You're so silly.)

425
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,420
Mr. Shi.

426
00:31:23,501 --> 00:31:25,920
I've been busy all day. I haven't even eaten yet.

427
00:31:28,892 --> 00:31:30,151
Look at this big table of dishes.

428
00:31:30,175 --> 00:31:31,675
You can't finish them all by yourself.

429
00:31:31,699 --> 00:31:33,122
It's too wasteful.

430
00:31:35,219 --> 00:31:36,682
If you don't want to waste it,

431
00:31:36,792 --> 00:31:38,482
sit down and eat it all.

432
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,657
Thank you for the hospitality. I will definitely respect the food,

433
00:31:46,681 --> 00:31:48,281
and eat it all without leaving anything.

434
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,820
That's so delicious!

435
00:32:10,903 --> 00:32:13,202
Which takeout is this? How come it tastes so good?

436
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,159
It's a place you can't order from.

437
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,962
Why do you look down on me?

438
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,360
It's too delicious.

439
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,579
If I could have this kind of food every time I wake up,

440
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,180
that would be so blessed.

441
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,220
It's not hard either.

442
00:32:35,419 --> 00:32:36,859
You're right, Mr. Shi.

443
00:32:37,018 --> 00:32:38,578
As long as I work hard,

444
00:32:38,698 --> 00:32:40,922
I can also afford such delicious food.

445
00:32:44,333 --> 00:32:45,722
So,

446
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,420
what do you think about

447
00:32:47,501 --> 00:32:49,259
the Mingyu Yunchuang's special report

448
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,700
that I mentioned to you before?

449
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,882
Can we continue to push it forward?

450
00:32:53,269 --> 00:32:55,219
I don't talk about work during my private time.

451
00:33:03,101 --> 00:33:04,722
And, she said it's not hard.

452
00:33:05,268 --> 00:33:07,887
Don't talk while eating. This may cause indigestion.

453
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,819
(Shu Yi. Do you have time now?)

454
00:33:19,017 --> 00:33:20,517
(Let's talk over the phone.)

455
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,479
Looking at your phone while eating is bad for your stomach.

456
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:33,449
(Ms. Yi. It's not convenient now. I'll call back later.)

457
00:33:56,219 --> 00:33:57,759
Mr. Shi, I'm done eating.

458
00:34:00,969 --> 00:34:03,990
Mr. Shi, where's my stuff?

459
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:37,002
Here you go.

460
00:34:38,048 --> 00:34:39,548
Thank you, Mr. Shi.

461
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,119
- Zheng Shu Yi. - No need to see me off.

462
00:34:42,215 --> 00:34:43,482
Goodbye, Mr. Shi.

463
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,600
You really love taking things and hanging around for free meals.

464
00:34:53,579 --> 00:34:55,109
(Shu Yi, in two days, there will be)

465
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,007
(an international industry forum in Wucheng.)

466
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,600
(You should attend the event.)

467
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,722
Okay, I'll set off tomorrow.

468
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:02,332
(Thanks for your hard work.)

469
00:35:11,381 --> 00:35:12,562
Shan Shan.

470
00:35:12,681 --> 00:35:15,072
I've visited Bogang Yunwan three times.

471
00:35:32,975 --> 00:35:34,618
Shan Shan, this way.

472
00:35:35,964 --> 00:35:38,003
Sorry for being late.

473
00:35:38,129 --> 00:35:39,168
Come here. Have a drink.

474
00:35:39,249 --> 00:35:41,129
- You should be punished with a drink. - Okay.

475
00:35:41,227 --> 00:35:42,267
- Fill it up. - Come on.

476
00:35:42,308 --> 00:35:43,349
Fill it up.

477
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,980
Excuse me for a moment.

478
00:35:45,847 --> 00:35:47,762
- Great! - You're a good drinker.

479
00:35:47,859 --> 00:35:49,359
Not bad.

480
00:35:49,446 --> 00:35:50,846
- Hello. - Long time no see.

481
00:35:50,927 --> 00:35:52,987
- Hello. - Hi.

482
00:35:53,344 --> 00:35:54,919
Shan Shan. You know him, right?

483
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,275
The prince from the Guan family.

484
00:35:56,299 --> 00:35:58,179
The CEO of Guan Capital.

485
00:35:58,299 --> 00:36:02,410
I met him once at the press conference.

486
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,400
Shan Shan is a beautiful journalist from Interactive Entertainment Net.

487
00:36:07,739 --> 00:36:08,922
Miss Bi

488
00:36:09,956 --> 00:36:12,386
looks even better in person than on camera.

489
00:36:13,345 --> 00:36:15,921
Shan Shan. You have to be careful.

490
00:36:16,059 --> 00:36:19,380
Mr. Guan is really a sweet-talker.

491
00:36:19,476 --> 00:36:21,396
He's a killer of beauties.

492
00:36:21,492 --> 00:36:23,231
But he's no match for me.

493
00:36:23,569 --> 00:36:24,969
I don't like sweet talk.

494
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,682
I like spicy food.

495
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,780
Come on. Let me treat everyone to a drink.

496
00:36:30,859 --> 00:36:33,242
- Come on. - Cheers.

497
00:36:43,996 --> 00:36:46,396
Qin Shi Yue really made a great contribution

498
00:36:46,501 --> 00:36:49,320
to Jiangcheng's with her own might.

499
00:36:54,699 --> 00:36:56,122
Hi there, delivery.

500
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,300
Miss. Are you running an online store?

501
00:36:59,931 --> 00:37:01,491
No. I'm returning them.

502
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,780
All of them?

503
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,079
What kind of store is this? The quality is so bad.

504
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:06,658
I bought too much. Sorry to trouble you.

505
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:07,882
Not at all.

506
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,510
How can I get to know him?

507
00:37:19,379 --> 00:37:22,282
I should at least try to get his WeChat.

508
00:37:29,659 --> 00:37:31,202
Yue.

509
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,681
Don't be lazy.

510
00:37:33,867 --> 00:37:36,362
I'm watching you on behalf of Shu Yi.

511
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,139
I've wronged you.

512
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,280
You're making quite a progress.

513
00:37:50,657 --> 00:37:52,378
Yu You is popular.

514
00:37:52,459 --> 00:37:53,738
He's worth studying.

515
00:37:53,819 --> 00:37:55,005
I remember Shu Yi seems to have

516
00:37:55,029 --> 00:37:57,768
gone to the University of Finance and Economics to interview him.

517
00:37:58,858 --> 00:37:59,939
Do more homework.

518
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,719
It will be of great help in the future.

519
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,400
Gone to the University of Finance and Economics to interview him?

520
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:11,562
For us finance students,

521
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:14,484
we all probably have a dream to become an investor.

522
00:38:14,651 --> 00:38:17,393
So, what's the most important thing for an investor?

523
00:38:17,581 --> 00:38:20,179
A very important key is to learn DD.

524
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:21,380
What is DD?

525
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,282
DD stands for due diligence.

526
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,419
It's an investigation conducted by the investor

527
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,859
and intermediary institutions,

528
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,275
with the cooperation of the business,

529
00:38:29,299 --> 00:38:31,675
on aspects such as the business's historical data and documents,

530
00:38:31,699 --> 00:38:33,579
management background,

531
00:38:33,699 --> 00:38:37,380
market risks, management risks, technical risks, and capital risks.

532
00:38:37,461 --> 00:38:39,101
It's a comprehensive and in-depth review,

533
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,322
and the cycle is usually three to six months.

534
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:44,679
I didn't expect him not to wear a suit and still look so handsome.

535
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:47,410
He's even more handsome than at the press conference.

536
00:38:48,261 --> 00:38:49,602
Oh, my God.

537
00:38:49,891 --> 00:38:52,881
Please give me such a university lecturer.

538
00:38:55,659 --> 00:38:57,519
For the recitation of the definitions,

539
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,419
I believe everyone must feel that it's very boring.

540
00:38:59,443 --> 00:39:01,823
But the knowledge points just mentioned are very important,

541
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,324
especially the four risks.

542
00:39:03,405 --> 00:39:04,565
Everyone must remember those.

543
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,220
The next in-class test will definitely cover them.

544
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,040
Hurry up and take note.

545
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,860
For some things, just looking at the surface isn't enough.

546
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:22,417
We need to investigate and understand more deeply and carefully.

547
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,340
Where are we now?

548
00:39:28,259 --> 00:39:29,656
We just started with the definition,

549
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,396
and it might seem a bit hard to understand.

550
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:33,139
Let's simplify it a bit.

551
00:39:33,259 --> 00:39:35,259
Let's relate it to our daily lives.

552
00:39:35,379 --> 00:39:38,020
If you want to get to know someone you are not familiar with

553
00:39:38,101 --> 00:39:39,261
or don't yet know,

554
00:39:39,388 --> 00:39:44,380
we would certainly want to know as much as possible about him.

555
00:39:44,468 --> 00:39:46,147
At this time, everyone will definitely

556
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,801
do some background checks

557
00:39:47,964 --> 00:39:50,123
from different dimensions and levels

558
00:39:50,259 --> 00:39:54,162
to understand the relevant information about this person in all aspects,

559
00:39:54,219 --> 00:39:55,659
so as to make up for the asymmetric

560
00:39:55,779 --> 00:39:57,779
and imperfect information between the two parties.

561
00:40:10,005 --> 00:40:11,162
That's it.

562
00:40:11,339 --> 00:40:13,096
If there's anything you don't understand, ask me.

563
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,076
- Professor Yu, we're leaving. - Thank you, professor.

564
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,920
- Bye. - Bye.

565
00:40:17,819 --> 00:40:19,049
Professor Yu.

566
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,362
Professor Yu.

567
00:40:21,677 --> 00:40:23,378
Can I add you on WeChat?

568
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,842
I want to ask you about some parts I don't understand.

569
00:40:28,056 --> 00:40:30,122
You can ask me whatever you don't understand now.

570
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,400
Where don't you understand?

571
00:40:37,299 --> 00:40:39,480
Professor Yu. Don't you remember me?

572
00:40:39,748 --> 00:40:42,469
Last time, you helped me get coffee at the financial center

573
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:44,442
during Yunchuang's press conference.

574
00:40:44,739 --> 00:40:46,980
I still remember. Is there something you need me for?

575
00:40:47,061 --> 00:40:48,561
I wanted to meet you!

576
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:53,930
Last time, I didn't have the chance to add you on WeChat.

577
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,402
You ran around half of Jiangcheng

578
00:40:56,748 --> 00:40:58,248
just to add me on WeChat?

579
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:01,570
It's not just that.

580
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:05,070
I'm an intern journalist for Financial Introduce.

581
00:41:05,259 --> 00:41:07,562
I just came here to learn.

582
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,108
You're a journalist for Financial Introduce too?

583
00:41:10,189 --> 00:41:12,162
Yes. I'm an intern.

584
00:41:12,266 --> 00:41:13,847
Shu Yi is my supervisor.

585
00:41:14,659 --> 00:41:16,159
So, you're under Shu Yi?

586
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:22,300
Can I come to your class next time?

587
00:41:22,699 --> 00:41:23,860
Yes.

588
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:27,402
But, one thing. Don't fall asleep next time.

589
00:41:28,508 --> 00:41:29,802
I'm teaching finance.

590
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,962
You can search for the learning materials online.

591
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,059
If you can't find them,

592
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,510
remember to tell me before the next class,

593
00:41:36,591 --> 00:41:37,962
and I'll help you prepare.

594
00:41:42,474 --> 00:41:43,762
What?

595
00:41:43,904 --> 00:41:46,534
You just ate and left with the bag?

596
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,162
Right.

597
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:51,322
(You're really something, Zheng Shu Yi.)

598
00:41:51,451 --> 00:41:54,402
But the editor was looking for me. What could I do?

599
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:56,720
No wonder Shi Yan didn't take you seriously.

600
00:41:57,501 --> 00:41:59,451
So, what do you suggest I do now?

601
00:42:00,405 --> 00:42:01,728
Where are you now?

602
00:42:01,809 --> 00:42:03,682
(I'm on a business trip in Wucheng.)

603
00:42:05,379 --> 00:42:08,082
Okay. Take a picture and post it on your WeChat Moments.

604
00:42:08,299 --> 00:42:09,659
(What should I say?)

605
00:42:09,779 --> 00:42:11,279
Nothing.

606
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:13,270
Nothing?

607
00:42:14,196 --> 00:42:15,362
(Just follow my lead.)

608
00:42:15,563 --> 00:42:17,283
If you've encountered anything interesting,

609
00:42:17,379 --> 00:42:19,289
remember to post it on your WeChat Moments.

610
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,282
Got it.
