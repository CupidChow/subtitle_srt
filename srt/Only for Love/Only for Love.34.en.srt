00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:36,117
(Only For Love)

2
00:01:36,198 --> 00:01:39,042
(Episode 34)

3
00:01:39,737 --> 00:01:40,882
Yes.

4
00:01:41,031 --> 00:01:42,882
We had some disagreements.

5
00:01:43,916 --> 00:01:46,242
But everyone was gossiping about you.

6
00:01:46,323 --> 00:01:48,160
Why do you have to say that I started it?

7
00:01:54,771 --> 00:01:56,002
You didn't do it?

8
00:01:58,487 --> 00:02:00,058
"Guess what I heard today.

9
00:02:00,139 --> 00:02:01,972
You know that intern, Qin Shi Yue, right?

10
00:02:02,053 --> 00:02:03,877
Zheng Shu Yi is dating her uncle."

11
00:02:06,313 --> 00:02:07,696
Come on, snatch it if you can.

12
00:02:07,783 --> 00:02:09,682
You'd better snatch it and smash it.

13
00:02:13,187 --> 00:02:16,062
Sometimes I really wonder if you have a brain.

14
00:02:16,143 --> 00:02:17,230
In this day and age,

15
00:02:17,311 --> 00:02:19,671
do you think you can destroy evidence by smashing my phone?

16
00:02:21,163 --> 00:02:22,798
The rumors have been circulating for so long.

17
00:02:22,822 --> 00:02:24,489
You should give me an explanation.

18
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,540
- Why are you running away? - Let go!

19
00:02:59,023 --> 00:03:02,322
Hello, please give me Mrs. Qiu's number.

20
00:03:02,964 --> 00:03:04,183
Okay, thank you.

21
00:03:33,711 --> 00:03:35,323
Hello, is this Mrs. Qiu?

22
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:36,642
(Who are you?)

23
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,693
I am Xu Yu Ling, a journalist from Financial Introduce.

24
00:03:38,717 --> 00:03:39,962
(What's the matter?)

25
00:03:40,734 --> 00:03:44,125
I took the liberty to call you today because I want to tell you something.

26
00:03:44,277 --> 00:03:45,482
(What is it about?)

27
00:03:45,847 --> 00:03:47,584
A journalist from our company, Zheng Shu Yi,

28
00:03:47,608 --> 00:03:49,442
is having an ambiguous relationship

29
00:03:49,571 --> 00:03:50,962
with your husband.

30
00:03:51,158 --> 00:03:53,971
The whole company is talking about it, so I thought...

31
00:03:54,052 --> 00:03:56,278
(Miss Xu, thank you for your concern, )

32
00:03:56,359 --> 00:03:58,578
(but you're mistaken.)

33
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:03,033
(The journalist you mentioned should be dating Mr. Shi.)

34
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:05,522
(How could there be such rumors about my husband?)

35
00:04:06,298 --> 00:04:07,298
Mrs. Qiu...

36
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:12,738
Shi Yan?

37
00:04:13,638 --> 00:04:15,162
How could it be Shi Yan?

38
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,322
Why is it still him?

39
00:04:19,037 --> 00:04:20,098
Please come in.

40
00:04:25,658 --> 00:04:27,122
What did the doctor say?

41
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,962
It's okay, not a big problem.

42
00:04:29,219 --> 00:04:30,642
Let's talk about the main issue.

43
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:32,037
Ms. Yi.

44
00:04:32,118 --> 00:04:34,962
Xu Yu Ling copied my outline and stole my interview.

45
00:04:35,043 --> 00:04:36,162
You're aware of that.

46
00:04:36,357 --> 00:04:38,117
I listened to you and didn't argue with her.

47
00:04:38,357 --> 00:04:40,179
But now she's spreading rumors about my private life,

48
00:04:40,203 --> 00:04:41,422
and I can't tolerate that.

49
00:04:41,551 --> 00:04:42,874
My hand is injured.

50
00:04:42,963 --> 00:04:44,845
I demand an explanation.

51
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:47,919
What happened?

52
00:04:48,143 --> 00:04:49,983
Is there any misunderstanding between you two?

53
00:04:50,064 --> 00:04:51,304
There's no misunderstanding.

54
00:04:51,385 --> 00:04:52,940
As I said before,

55
00:04:53,106 --> 00:04:55,307
I'm in a serious relationship with my boyfriend.

56
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:58,299
But she made malicious speculations, spread rumors and caused a commotion.

57
00:04:58,323 --> 00:05:00,282
You've heard all the rumors that have spread.

58
00:05:00,397 --> 00:05:01,842
I don't want to repeat it.

59
00:05:02,138 --> 00:05:04,447
So what's going on between you and your boyfriend?

60
00:05:04,799 --> 00:05:07,080
What happened between me and my boyfriend doesn't matter.

61
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:09,840
I've said it before, we're having a normal relationship.

62
00:05:10,026 --> 00:05:11,879
And he's not some old man.

63
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,600
He's an unmarried young man.

64
00:05:13,703 --> 00:05:14,962
Is there a problem?

65
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:21,980
Shu Yi.

66
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:24,879
Your hand is injured, go back and rest.

67
00:05:25,104 --> 00:05:27,711
I'll talk to the editor-in-chief about this matter.

68
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,402
Don't worry.

69
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,680
No matter what, I'll give you an explanation this time.

70
00:05:39,157 --> 00:05:40,362
Have a good rest.

71
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,002
There's no rush to come back to work.

72
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,510
I won't count it as your leave.

73
00:05:47,373 --> 00:05:48,514
Then I'll go back now.

74
00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:23,402
What's wrong?

75
00:06:25,181 --> 00:06:26,402
Give me a hug.

76
00:06:30,678 --> 00:06:32,748
What happened to your hand? What happened?

77
00:06:33,323 --> 00:06:34,484
I'm fine.

78
00:06:34,715 --> 00:06:38,064
My colleague closed the door without noticing me and caught my hand.

79
00:06:40,635 --> 00:06:42,145
Why are you so careless?

80
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:52,011
Does it still hurt?

81
00:06:52,471 --> 00:06:53,771
It hurts so much.

82
00:06:54,816 --> 00:06:56,726
I feel like I'm going to be disabled.

83
00:06:57,964 --> 00:06:58,964
It's not that bad.

84
00:06:59,102 --> 00:07:00,442
I mean it.

85
00:07:00,926 --> 00:07:02,682
I can't move my right hand.

86
00:07:02,873 --> 00:07:04,282
Only my left hand can be used.

87
00:07:04,385 --> 00:07:05,856
Isn't that considered disabled?

88
00:07:06,932 --> 00:07:08,362
What did the doctor say?

89
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,122
The doctor said

90
00:07:11,206 --> 00:07:13,162
I'll need someone to feed me from now on,

91
00:07:14,947 --> 00:07:16,682
even for drinking water.

92
00:07:22,861 --> 00:07:24,640
Did you hear what I said?

93
00:07:24,885 --> 00:07:27,002
The doctor said someone has to feed me water.

94
00:07:29,221 --> 00:07:30,882
Someone has to carry my bag too.

95
00:07:33,811 --> 00:07:35,322
Someone has to comb my hair.

96
00:07:38,014 --> 00:07:39,437
And someone needs to carry me upstairs.

97
00:07:39,461 --> 00:07:40,800
Princess carry.

98
00:07:47,101 --> 00:07:48,482
You're the best.

99
00:08:12,822 --> 00:08:14,202
Move into my house.

100
00:08:14,414 --> 00:08:16,442
I'll do whatever I promise you.

101
00:08:24,559 --> 00:08:27,482
(Why am I suddenly moving to his house?)

102
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:29,722
(It's not so good, is it?)

103
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:32,442
(Did we skip too many steps?)

104
00:08:32,633 --> 00:08:35,942
(Are all CEOs so focused on efficiency nowadays?)

105
00:08:36,093 --> 00:08:41,404
(Besides, my request has nothing to do with moving to his house.)

106
00:08:41,486 --> 00:08:42,926
(It's as if moving there)

107
00:08:43,015 --> 00:08:45,485
(means he'll come home for meals every day.)

108
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:48,531
(Right, that's it.)

109
00:08:48,636 --> 00:08:49,636
(Case closed.)

110
00:08:52,821 --> 00:08:53,821
Where are you going?

111
00:08:54,221 --> 00:08:55,401
Go home and pack my things.

112
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:12,562
What's wrong?

113
00:09:13,461 --> 00:09:15,682
Nothing, I just want a kiss.

114
00:09:18,567 --> 00:09:19,962
Just one kiss.

115
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:28,592
Where's the wine? Do you have any wine here?

116
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:32,397
Give me some wine. If it doesn't work, just pour alcohol directly.

117
00:09:33,501 --> 00:09:35,171
Don't mess around in the office.

118
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,522
If you don't mind,

119
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:53,562
let's do it.

120
00:09:56,132 --> 00:09:58,001
You should focus on your work.

121
00:10:07,501 --> 00:10:10,010
Your office door is broken.

122
00:10:19,517 --> 00:10:20,658
It's not broken.

123
00:10:31,261 --> 00:10:32,891
You pressed the wrong button.

124
00:10:55,101 --> 00:10:57,780
Hello. Go back to our old house these few days.

125
00:10:57,861 --> 00:10:58,862
(Why?)

126
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,282
(I won't go back.)

127
00:11:00,381 --> 00:11:02,531
My girlfriend is coming to stay for a few days.

128
00:11:09,181 --> 00:11:11,262
I tried it, but it's impossible.

129
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,722
The time is too tight.

130
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:17,852
Chen Kang, have you considered Professor Li's suggestion?

131
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,300
Mr. Shi.

132
00:11:20,381 --> 00:11:21,931
I know you mean well for Le'an,

133
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:24,042
but Le'an is my life's work.

134
00:11:24,285 --> 00:11:26,362
There's no way I'd give it up to anyone else.

135
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,820
Okay.

136
00:11:28,998 --> 00:11:30,922
Then let's think of other ways.

137
00:11:31,397 --> 00:11:32,635
But you have to have confidence.

138
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:34,002
- Okay. - I'm leaving.

139
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:35,322
Bye, Mr. Shi.

140
00:11:47,398 --> 00:11:48,842
(Is your luggage packed?)

141
00:11:54,705 --> 00:11:55,824
(My hand is injured.)

142
00:11:55,901 --> 00:11:57,201
(I can't pack my luggage.)

143
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,719
(Wait for me.)

144
00:12:02,082 --> 00:12:06,762
(Notice of Transfer of Employment)

145
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:10,002
You went a little too far this time.

146
00:12:10,581 --> 00:12:12,181
The education section is short of staff.

147
00:12:12,221 --> 00:12:13,900
I already discussed it with the editor-in-chief.

148
00:12:13,924 --> 00:12:16,962
You have extensive experience, and you can take charge after you go there.

149
00:12:17,224 --> 00:12:19,164
Please hand over your current work.

150
00:12:19,307 --> 00:12:20,867
You can start next week.

151
00:12:27,078 --> 00:12:29,158
Thank you and the editor-in-chief for your kindness.

152
00:12:31,238 --> 00:12:32,459
But I don't accept

153
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:35,398
this arrangement.

154
00:12:36,761 --> 00:12:38,162
When I made a name for myself,

155
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,402
Zheng Shu Yi was still a nobody.

156
00:12:40,623 --> 00:12:42,802
It's not that I don't have anywhere to go.

157
00:12:43,149 --> 00:12:44,749
I've been staying at Financial Introduce

158
00:12:44,829 --> 00:12:47,162
because I believe no one can do it better than me.

159
00:12:47,261 --> 00:12:51,362
From now on, I decide where I go and what I do.

160
00:12:56,861 --> 00:12:57,861
Ms. Yi.

161
00:12:58,781 --> 00:12:59,962
Thank you.

162
00:13:01,065 --> 00:13:03,646
Thank you for your guidance over the years.

163
00:13:31,346 --> 00:13:32,346
This one?

164
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:36,802
Which one do you want?

165
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:38,630
That coat.

166
00:13:47,675 --> 00:13:48,682
Anything else?

167
00:13:49,098 --> 00:13:50,118
And those.

168
00:13:57,381 --> 00:13:58,642
Do you need anything else?

169
00:13:58,763 --> 00:13:59,763
Nothing.

170
00:14:01,725 --> 00:14:03,762
Take these daily necessities with you.

171
00:14:04,038 --> 00:14:05,038
Never mind.

172
00:14:05,265 --> 00:14:07,094
I'll call a moving company to pick them up.

173
00:14:07,775 --> 00:14:08,835
No need.

174
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,180
I'm just staying at your house for a few days. I'm not leaving for good.

175
00:14:13,571 --> 00:14:15,922
If I need anything, I can come back and get it.

176
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:26,562
You don't want me to come home, do you, Mr. Shi?

177
00:14:29,517 --> 00:14:32,155
I'm thinking, if you still want to go home

178
00:14:32,236 --> 00:14:33,716
after living in my house for a while,

179
00:14:33,762 --> 00:14:36,854
then the developer of my house is a complete failure.

180
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,270
I seem to be at a loss too.

181
00:14:39,327 --> 00:14:40,882
As a qualified businessman,

182
00:14:41,011 --> 00:14:43,592
I wouldn't make such a losing deal.

183
00:15:06,884 --> 00:15:07,884
What?

184
00:15:09,781 --> 00:15:11,484
Weren't you quite bold before?

185
00:15:11,565 --> 00:15:14,102
You dared to enter a stranger's house alone in the middle of the night.

186
00:15:14,126 --> 00:15:15,596
What are you afraid of now?

187
00:15:16,748 --> 00:15:18,242
What am I afraid of?

188
00:15:18,394 --> 00:15:19,745
My feet hurt.

189
00:15:20,301 --> 00:15:21,301
Is that so?

190
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:23,723
I'll carry you then.

191
00:15:26,132 --> 00:15:27,642
I'm not that delicate.

192
00:15:41,234 --> 00:15:42,482
The food is ready.

193
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,540
Here you go.

194
00:16:18,261 --> 00:16:19,261
Why?

195
00:16:22,221 --> 00:16:24,301
This is not a scallion. It's Chinese water chestnut.

196
00:16:26,126 --> 00:16:27,915
Who asked you about this?

197
00:16:30,748 --> 00:16:32,042
It's really not a scallion?

198
00:16:32,128 --> 00:16:33,562
Why do they look exactly the same?

199
00:16:33,765 --> 00:16:35,004
They just look alike.

200
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,459
One belongs to the Alliaceae family,

201
00:16:36,483 --> 00:16:38,552
and the other is a perennial bulbous plant.

202
00:16:40,302 --> 00:16:41,523
I see.

203
00:16:43,324 --> 00:16:45,402
I'm not talking about this.

204
00:16:45,781 --> 00:16:48,762
Have you forgotten what you promised me today?

205
00:16:49,276 --> 00:16:51,722
Were you just trying to trick me into coming to your house?

206
00:16:55,821 --> 00:16:56,821
Yes.

207
00:17:27,341 --> 00:17:28,482
Open your mouth.

208
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:45,983
(Is this eating?)

209
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,500
Hello.

210
00:18:11,019 --> 00:18:13,218
(Mr. Shi, there's a reply from Jianxing.)

211
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:15,162
(Should I arrange a trip for you?)

212
00:18:16,092 --> 00:18:17,882
Ask Guan Ji to go.

213
00:18:18,061 --> 00:18:19,280
Lately,

214
00:18:20,985 --> 00:18:22,082
I'm tied up.

215
00:18:22,378 --> 00:18:23,378
(Okay.)

216
00:18:33,467 --> 00:18:35,297
Can you help me tie up my hair?

217
00:18:57,396 --> 00:18:59,289
Be gentle, it hurts.

218
00:18:59,558 --> 00:19:00,642
Okay.

219
00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:23,844
You do your work.

220
00:19:23,933 --> 00:19:25,682
I'm going to take a shower and go to bed.

221
00:19:28,141 --> 00:19:31,091
(Why can't this person understand my subtext?)

222
00:19:33,101 --> 00:19:36,052
I mean, where do I sleep?

223
00:19:40,741 --> 00:19:42,042
What do you think?

224
00:19:45,272 --> 00:19:46,642
I'll take a shower first.

225
00:19:52,301 --> 00:19:53,301
Shu Yi.

226
00:19:54,873 --> 00:19:55,873
What's wrong?

227
00:19:56,036 --> 00:19:57,842
Did the doctor say

228
00:19:58,051 --> 00:19:59,601
you need help showering?

229
00:20:02,478 --> 00:20:04,348
The doctor said it's not necessary.

230
00:20:07,251 --> 00:20:08,251
Really?

231
00:20:12,061 --> 00:20:15,038
You need help eating and drinking.

232
00:20:15,278 --> 00:20:16,802
You can't even tie your hair.

233
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,310
How will you shower?

234
00:20:20,241 --> 00:20:21,862
I can just avoid getting wet.

235
00:20:21,949 --> 00:20:24,562
I took a shower before going out this morning.

236
00:20:24,653 --> 00:20:25,766
A brief one will do.

237
00:20:27,746 --> 00:20:29,056
How brief?

238
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:31,572
Do you not need to undress?

239
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:34,468
Or do you not need to apply shower gel?

240
00:20:36,931 --> 00:20:39,602
I've already said no need.

241
00:20:42,861 --> 00:20:44,331
You really don't care about hygiene.

242
00:20:46,356 --> 00:20:48,416
Yes, I don't care about hygiene.

243
00:20:48,662 --> 00:20:49,679
Shu Yi.

244
00:20:50,061 --> 00:20:51,370
You really don't need my help?

245
00:20:52,362 --> 00:20:55,592
If you call me later, I might not have the patience.

246
00:20:56,181 --> 00:20:57,201
Don't regret it.

247
00:20:58,719 --> 00:21:00,562
I told you I don't need any help.

248
00:21:00,643 --> 00:21:03,402
If I change my mind, I'll call you my dad.

249
00:21:31,954 --> 00:21:32,954
Dad.

250
00:21:34,882 --> 00:21:37,152
Help me fasten my bra.

251
00:21:42,755 --> 00:21:44,162
What did you say?

252
00:21:45,242 --> 00:21:46,962
(What's wrong with fastening a bra?)

253
00:21:47,084 --> 00:21:48,684
(It's just fastening a bra.)

254
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:51,545
(It's not like I'm asking him to jump and do a reverse slam dunk.)

255
00:21:52,906 --> 00:21:54,682
Help me fasten my bra.

256
00:21:54,763 --> 00:21:56,682
Hurry up, I'm tired.

257
00:22:23,495 --> 00:22:24,495
Done.

258
00:22:31,066 --> 00:22:32,242
What's wrong?

259
00:22:32,376 --> 00:22:34,056
Is there anything else you need help with?

260
00:22:34,914 --> 00:22:35,914
Nothing.

261
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:40,673
Are you doing this because you're nervous or in pain?

262
00:23:42,461 --> 00:23:44,890
(Can't I be both in pain and nervous?)

263
00:23:47,475 --> 00:23:48,654
It hurts.

264
00:23:48,941 --> 00:23:50,779
The nerves of the fingertips are linked with the heart.

265
00:23:50,803 --> 00:23:52,922
Like needles piercing my heart.

266
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:57,995
Did you take painkillers?

267
00:23:58,856 --> 00:24:01,325
I did, but it still hurts.

268
00:24:06,174 --> 00:24:07,282
Go to sleep.

269
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:09,181
You won't feel pain once you fall asleep.

270
00:26:14,701 --> 00:26:15,701
Shi Yan.

271
00:26:17,574 --> 00:26:18,842
Shi Yan?

272
00:26:39,501 --> 00:26:40,501
(Are you up?)

273
00:26:41,501 --> 00:26:43,092
When did you leave?

274
00:26:43,258 --> 00:26:44,258
(Eight o'clock.)

275
00:26:45,243 --> 00:26:46,482
So early.

276
00:26:48,723 --> 00:26:50,444
I suddenly remembered,

277
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:53,365
did you get up in the middle of the night and take a shower last night?

278
00:26:55,581 --> 00:26:57,282
(I thought I was dreaming.)

279
00:26:58,587 --> 00:27:00,258
(Okay, go ahead with your work.)

280
00:27:12,916 --> 00:27:16,082
I'm lying openly on his bed.

281
00:27:16,619 --> 00:27:18,268
But nothing even happened.

282
00:27:18,349 --> 00:27:20,019
He didn't even kiss me.

283
00:27:27,989 --> 00:27:30,148
Shi Yan is quite strange.

284
00:27:30,229 --> 00:27:32,421
He actually asked you to go on a business trip for him.

285
00:27:32,445 --> 00:27:34,410
Isn't he a workaholic?

286
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,099
I heard from his assistant that

287
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:37,568
Miss Zheng's hand is injured.

288
00:27:37,661 --> 00:27:39,205
I guess he wants to stay and take care of her.

289
00:27:39,229 --> 00:27:40,892
Shu Yi's hand is injured?

290
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:42,238
You don't know about this?

291
00:27:49,861 --> 00:27:51,292
(You injured your hand?)

292
00:27:52,883 --> 00:27:54,417
It's okay, just a minor injury.

293
00:27:54,498 --> 00:27:56,002
I'll recover in a couple of days.

294
00:27:59,305 --> 00:28:01,202
(Remember to change the bandages on time.)

295
00:28:01,292 --> 00:28:03,212
(Avoid getting wet. Be cautious with your diet.)

296
00:28:03,253 --> 00:28:04,802
(It shouldn't be a big problem.)

297
00:28:09,804 --> 00:28:12,122
(Why do you sound so spiritless?)

298
00:28:12,239 --> 00:28:14,002
(Didn't Shi Yan take care of you?)

299
00:28:15,266 --> 00:28:17,802
I'm currently staying at Shi Yan's house.

300
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:26,938
(Well done.)

301
00:28:27,018 --> 00:28:28,808
(You're fast.)

302
00:28:29,494 --> 00:28:32,213
We slept in the same bed last night.

303
00:28:32,373 --> 00:28:33,373
Enough.

304
00:28:33,506 --> 00:28:34,787
I don't want to hear this.

305
00:28:34,899 --> 00:28:36,849
(If you continue talking, I will report you.)

306
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:38,841
And then nothing happened.

307
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:43,091
Is it funny?

308
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,470
(Not funny, but I feel sorry for you.)

309
00:29:03,554 --> 00:29:06,461
All right, it's only three days.

310
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:09,531
You're just going on a business trip to Nanjiang, not leaving for good.

311
00:29:12,218 --> 00:29:13,568
Only three days?

312
00:29:14,818 --> 00:29:16,921
So, you're annoyed with me and tired of me?

313
00:29:17,101 --> 00:29:20,081
Even if I leave you for three days, it won't have any impact on you.

314
00:29:22,579 --> 00:29:24,482
Are you worried about me?

315
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:26,409
Or are you lacking confidence in yourself?

316
00:29:29,638 --> 00:29:30,882
Guan Ji.

317
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:33,947
We can't be together every minute.

318
00:29:34,121 --> 00:29:36,231
So, if we want a long-lasting relationship,

319
00:29:36,312 --> 00:29:38,162
we need to trust each other first.

320
00:29:38,396 --> 00:29:40,499
The second thing is to control ourselves.

321
00:29:40,649 --> 00:29:41,962
Be loyal to each other.

322
00:29:42,121 --> 00:29:43,300
I can do that.

323
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:45,229
You can trust me.

324
00:29:46,527 --> 00:29:48,082
I trust you.

325
00:29:48,257 --> 00:29:49,607
I can also control myself.

326
00:29:51,778 --> 00:29:53,909
But I just can't bear to leave you.

327
00:29:55,819 --> 00:29:57,528
Then come back early.

328
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:04,661
- Shan Shan. - Zhuang.

329
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,602
It's really you, Shan Shan.

330
00:30:06,927 --> 00:30:08,359
I'm sending off my boyfriend on a business trip.

331
00:30:08,383 --> 00:30:09,978
Good job, Shan Shan.

332
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:11,482
You've kept it a secret.

333
00:30:11,642 --> 00:30:14,192
Or is it that you haven't passed the probationary period?

334
00:30:17,028 --> 00:30:18,522
Shan Shan is our treasure.

335
00:30:18,627 --> 00:30:20,082
You must treat her well.

336
00:30:20,171 --> 00:30:22,642
If you dare to bully her, I won't let you off.

337
00:30:22,898 --> 00:30:24,079
Are you picking someone up?

338
00:30:25,437 --> 00:30:26,737
I'm picking up my fiancée.

339
00:30:27,621 --> 00:30:30,082
- We're getting married in a couple of days. - Really?

340
00:30:30,809 --> 00:30:33,721
Congratulations, I'll give you a big red envelope.

341
00:30:33,802 --> 00:30:35,002
Thanks.

342
00:30:35,552 --> 00:30:37,502
When will it be your turn?

343
00:30:39,387 --> 00:30:40,642
It's still early.

344
00:30:41,057 --> 00:30:42,562
What do you mean still early?

345
00:30:42,964 --> 00:30:44,183
It's just a matter of time.

346
00:30:59,461 --> 00:31:01,202
Not attractive?

347
00:31:30,623 --> 00:31:32,762
Xu Yu Ling is really...

348
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,239
I can't use the laptop or type.

349
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,682
I have to sit here alone.

350
00:31:44,809 --> 00:31:46,319
I'm so miserable.

351
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:58,741
(I asked Qin Shi Yue to come over and help.)

352
00:32:04,949 --> 00:32:06,322
Shi Yan.

353
00:32:07,227 --> 00:32:10,962
Are you blatantly telling me that I'm not attractive?

354
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:24,541
Shu Yi.

355
00:32:26,901 --> 00:32:27,901
Come.

356
00:32:31,461 --> 00:32:32,922
Is your hand okay?

357
00:32:33,332 --> 00:32:34,522
I'm fine.

358
00:32:34,603 --> 00:32:35,882
I'm not that fragile.

359
00:33:03,941 --> 00:33:05,372
Uncle, you're back.

360
00:33:05,891 --> 00:33:08,331
The task you entrusted to me has been successfully completed.

361
00:33:11,061 --> 00:33:12,241
You can leave now.

362
00:33:16,058 --> 00:33:17,298
It doesn't hurt anymore, right?

363
00:33:17,432 --> 00:33:19,522
I've been working for your wife all day.

364
00:33:19,637 --> 00:33:21,402
You won't even give me a meal.

365
00:33:22,017 --> 00:33:23,088
Are you hungry?

366
00:33:28,489 --> 00:33:30,249
I'll cook something delicious for you later.

367
00:33:30,866 --> 00:33:31,967
What do you want to eat?

368
00:33:43,595 --> 00:33:45,585
(You're not attractive at all.)

369
00:33:47,601 --> 00:33:48,901
Sit over here.

370
00:33:58,981 --> 00:34:00,650
What's on your mind?

371
00:34:02,178 --> 00:34:03,438
I'm thinking,

372
00:34:03,661 --> 00:34:05,451
can I sit on your lap?

373
00:34:06,981 --> 00:34:07,981
No.

374
00:34:11,101 --> 00:34:12,361
Why?

375
00:34:14,258 --> 00:34:16,722
Because you won't be able to have dinner.

376
00:34:20,234 --> 00:34:22,745
(Are you just good at talking?)

377
00:34:26,061 --> 00:34:27,322
I insist.

378
00:34:41,912 --> 00:34:42,971
Whatever.

379
00:35:10,381 --> 00:35:11,600
Why are you looking at me?

380
00:35:12,558 --> 00:35:13,558
Nothing.

381
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,602
I'm going to sleep.

382
00:36:32,547 --> 00:36:33,547
Shu Yi.

383
00:36:37,548 --> 00:36:39,508
Remember to take painkillers before going to bed.

384
00:36:40,152 --> 00:36:41,942
(That's all?)

385
00:37:08,002 --> 00:37:10,922
(First Hospital of Jiangcheng)

386
00:37:37,277 --> 00:37:39,935
(Unbelievable, I heard something today.)

387
00:37:40,704 --> 00:37:42,042
(What's the matter?)

388
00:37:46,395 --> 00:37:47,762
You're back.

389
00:38:06,947 --> 00:38:08,817
Did you drink?

390
00:38:11,835 --> 00:38:12,856
A little.

391
00:38:21,419 --> 00:38:23,478
(Bye, I'm going to sleep.)

392
00:38:25,304 --> 00:38:26,562
(So early?)

393
00:38:29,572 --> 00:38:31,722
(Early? It's already 11 o'clock.)

394
00:38:35,364 --> 00:38:38,274
(You went to sleep after midnight the past few days.)

395
00:38:40,381 --> 00:38:43,490
(Are you and Shi Yan...)

396
00:38:51,457 --> 00:38:53,002
(No.)

397
00:38:55,279 --> 00:38:56,922
(Really?)

398
00:39:03,402 --> 00:39:04,962
(What's that got to do with me?)

399
00:39:05,141 --> 00:39:06,811
(Do you think it's my problem?)

400
00:39:22,982 --> 00:39:24,842
Are you going to take a shower?

401
00:39:25,956 --> 00:39:27,242
Not for now.

402
00:39:46,549 --> 00:39:49,322
I was worried about hurting your fingers.

403
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:53,220
- I... - I didn't come here to hear your explanation.

404
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:15,624
- Hello. - Hello.

405
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,122
I'm looking for Miss Zheng.

406
00:40:17,861 --> 00:40:19,821
Shu Yi injured her hand and took a sick leave.

407
00:40:19,909 --> 00:40:20,909
Injured?

408
00:40:23,701 --> 00:40:25,026
Thanks.

409
00:40:40,677 --> 00:40:41,978
Why?

410
00:40:42,066 --> 00:40:44,762
(Mr. Yi)

411
00:40:47,181 --> 00:40:48,642
Someone's calling me.

412
00:41:00,347 --> 00:41:01,347
Hello?

413
00:41:01,817 --> 00:41:02,832
(Hello, Shu Yi.)

414
00:41:02,913 --> 00:41:03,982
I came to see you at Financial Introduce.

415
00:41:04,006 --> 00:41:05,406
Your colleague said you're injured.

416
00:41:05,441 --> 00:41:06,522
Are you okay?

417
00:41:07,204 --> 00:41:08,362
I'm fine.

418
00:41:08,613 --> 00:41:09,957
Is there anything you need?

419
00:41:10,258 --> 00:41:13,919
(Nothing. I just want to have a meal with you and talk about something.)

420
00:41:14,309 --> 00:41:15,613
We don't need to have a meal together.

421
00:41:15,637 --> 00:41:16,859
Just tell me directly.

422
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:20,282
Shu Yi.

423
00:41:46,244 --> 00:41:47,554
What's wrong, Mr. Shi?

424
00:41:47,667 --> 00:41:48,922
Are you mad?

425
00:41:59,262 --> 00:42:01,162
I'm yours anyway.

426
00:42:01,403 --> 00:42:03,162
Why are you so easily mad?

427
00:42:09,197 --> 00:42:10,758
He disturbed us early in the morning.

428
00:42:10,863 --> 00:42:12,163
Can't I be mad?

429
00:42:13,872 --> 00:42:16,322
Shi Yan, you're scaring me again.
