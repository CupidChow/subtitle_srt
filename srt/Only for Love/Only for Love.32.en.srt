1
00:01:31,005 --> 00:01:36,011
(Only For You)

2
00:01:36,092 --> 00:01:39,044
(Episode 32)

3
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:49,670
Shu Yi, what are you doing?

4
00:02:09,638 --> 00:02:12,282
(You should be well prepared. There shouldn't be any problems.)

5
00:02:29,381 --> 00:02:30,691
Yue Xing Zhou.

6
00:02:31,608 --> 00:02:32,802
Please sit down.

7
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,029
Please introduce yourself.

8
00:02:45,282 --> 00:02:50,459
Me? My name is Yue Xing Zhou.

9
00:02:55,293 --> 00:02:58,493
Look at him. As a man, he doesn't want to work hard

10
00:02:58,574 --> 00:03:00,031
and wants to take the shortcut instead.

11
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:01,526
He thought you were...

12
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,190
What did he think?

13
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,762
Maybe it was all a misunderstanding.

14
00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:09,839
He thought you were Le's uncle

15
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,679
so he dumped Miss Zheng

16
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,400
and went with Le.

17
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,941
What is your career plan afterward?

18
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,849
Once I join Yunchuang,

19
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,602
I will achieve my self-worth in my own position.

20
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,790
(Thinking of you.)

21
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:05,299
(Will Yunchuang's special report continue?)

22
00:04:07,302 --> 00:04:09,051
(Of course it will continue.)

23
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,322
(I plan to work overtime on the weekends.)

24
00:04:12,757 --> 00:04:14,343
(Are you going to work overtime on the weekends too?)

25
00:04:14,367 --> 00:04:17,282
(I don't know if I have a chance to prove myself.)

26
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:20,082
(Yes.)

27
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,781
Here I am.

28
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,630
Am I invisible?

29
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,379
Go sit over there.

30
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:00,799
(You said you were coming for overtime.)

31
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,120
(So, you really came for overtime?)

32
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,471
Book two movie tickets.

33
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,322
(Do you need a private screening?)

34
00:06:35,012 --> 00:06:36,012
No need.

35
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:40,631
I want the tickets for the nearest time slot.

36
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,881
(Okay. I'll send the information to your phone later.)

37
00:07:12,712 --> 00:07:14,322
Shall we watch the movie?

38
00:07:15,007 --> 00:07:17,156
No rush. Let me take a look at you first.

39
00:07:20,795 --> 00:07:22,664
What are you looking at?

40
00:07:30,136 --> 00:07:31,317
To check whether this movie

41
00:07:31,398 --> 00:07:33,442
is worth wasting two hours of my time.

42
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:48,000
Shi Yan, are you coming to watch the movie too?

43
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,280
Fiona.

44
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,442
Why have you not come to find me for so long?

45
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,669
The movie has started. Let's go.

46
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,002
(My darling.)

47
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:13,433
(I know what you're thinking.)

48
00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:16,322
(We'll get married when I finish this.)

49
00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:19,360
- (Okay.) - Do you eat popcorn?

50
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,280
No.

51
00:08:27,678 --> 00:08:28,762
Shi Yan.

52
00:08:28,852 --> 00:08:31,092
We want to order some drinks. What do you want to drink?

53
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,460
No, thanks.

54
00:08:51,088 --> 00:08:52,562
Eat one piece.

55
00:08:52,811 --> 00:08:53,811
No.

56
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,442
Just have one.

57
00:09:32,702 --> 00:09:34,042
(I'm getting married.)

58
00:09:35,095 --> 00:09:36,482
(Remember to come to the wedding.)

59
00:09:47,415 --> 00:09:49,042
This female lead is really ruthless.

60
00:09:49,983 --> 00:09:53,414
She chose the key period of his career to send him an invitation.

61
00:09:54,477 --> 00:09:55,477
That's pretty ruthless.

62
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,280
Exactly.

63
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:00,491
She should have taken it slow.

64
00:10:02,596 --> 00:10:03,596
What?

65
00:10:05,093 --> 00:10:06,973
Wait until the full moon banquet to invite him.

66
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,602
But I think a woman isn't stable if she isn't ruthless.

67
00:10:33,471 --> 00:10:34,631
Can you hold it for me?

68
00:10:34,712 --> 00:10:36,343
I want to go to the restroom.

69
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:44,522
I'll wait for you downstairs.

70
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,780
Shi Yan.

71
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,099
Where's the lady who came with you just now?

72
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,751
She went to the restroom.

73
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,442
She's really pretty.

74
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:02,140
Indeed she is.

75
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:08,253
Oh yeah, I've booked dinner. Do you want to come together?

76
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,334
No need.

77
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,122
She's quite shy.

78
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:15,868
Right? I think so too.

79
00:11:15,949 --> 00:11:17,416
This kind of movie is just a waste of time.

80
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,960
Yeah, so boring.

81
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,400
I won't watch it again next time.

82
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,919
- Bye. - Bye.

83
00:11:27,191 --> 00:11:28,660
What a shy woman.

84
00:11:31,695 --> 00:11:32,695
Dear.

85
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,402
It's always so coincidental to meet her.

86
00:11:35,535 --> 00:11:37,844
This time, you have to introduce her to me.

87
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,682
This is Fiona.

88
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,860
Zheng Shu Yi, a journalist from Financial Introduce.

89
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,919
Hello, Miss Zheng.

90
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,020
Fiona.

91
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,790
Hello, Fiona.

92
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:00,536
The restaurant is booked. Let's go eat first.

93
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,922
We can catch up later.

94
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,240
I'm leaving first.

95
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,440
Bye.

96
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,621
The weather is really nice today.

97
00:12:28,092 --> 00:12:29,311
What are you up to now?

98
00:12:30,432 --> 00:12:31,592
I don't want to take the car.

99
00:12:31,623 --> 00:12:33,082
Will you walk with me for a bit?

100
00:12:36,118 --> 00:12:37,438
We just watched a movie together.

101
00:12:37,479 --> 00:12:38,837
What's wrong with taking a walk together?

102
00:12:38,861 --> 00:12:39,901
Full service.

103
00:12:39,982 --> 00:12:41,002
Service?

104
00:12:41,798 --> 00:12:43,162
Am I serving you?

105
00:12:44,151 --> 00:12:45,762
That's not what I meant.

106
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:48,562
Who is supposed to show good performance?

107
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,840
Me?

108
00:12:53,455 --> 00:12:54,964
I suddenly want to take the car.

109
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,179
(Did I impress him with my beauty just now?)

110
00:13:11,816 --> 00:13:15,549
(But it's not good to kiss in public.)

111
00:13:15,686 --> 00:13:17,566
(It will have a bad influence on the children.)

112
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:22,179
(Sometimes, men's uncontrollable aggression is really worrying.)

113
00:13:36,864 --> 00:13:39,404
What? You thought I was going to kiss you?

114
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:43,201
Yeah, isn't that okay?

115
00:13:44,662 --> 00:13:47,812
I'm not used to kissing in public.

116
00:13:50,354 --> 00:13:52,554
If I had known, I would have gotten in the car earlier.

117
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,800
(How about we have dinner together tomorrow?)

118
00:14:27,078 --> 00:14:28,078
(No.)

119
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,082
(Shu Yi, how have you been lately?)

120
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,829
What are you doing with my phone?

121
00:14:51,093 --> 00:14:54,483
You think I have feelings for them, don't you?

122
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,556
Not at all.

123
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,870
I think all the guys in the world

124
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:04,470
are interested in you.

125
00:15:11,361 --> 00:15:13,042
I definitely don't.

126
00:15:22,807 --> 00:15:25,638
If that's what you think, then there's nothing I can do.

127
00:15:27,071 --> 00:15:30,202
(Why does it sound like I'm some kind of slut?)

128
00:15:33,205 --> 00:15:34,562
What are you laughing at?

129
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,221
Nothing.

130
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,002
I'm just friends with them.

131
00:15:40,619 --> 00:15:42,366
If you want people not to know,

132
00:15:42,518 --> 00:15:44,107
you should not do it yourself.

133
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,202
You said it like it was a date.

134
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,079
I was just buying a suitcase that day and happened to bump into him,

135
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,442
so we had a meal together.

136
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,189
Why did you buy a suitcase?

137
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,765
I was so heartbroken

138
00:15:58,846 --> 00:16:01,079
that I was leaving this place and going to another city

139
00:16:01,183 --> 00:16:03,122
to start a new life.

140
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,122
How long and how many days?

141
00:16:06,986 --> 00:16:09,580
I said I wanted to start a new life in a different city.

142
00:16:09,662 --> 00:16:11,174
Were you even listening to me?

143
00:16:15,597 --> 00:16:16,897
No fun.

144
00:16:17,861 --> 00:16:20,061
I'm going on a business trip. I have an interview task.

145
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:23,909
But I might as well do some data collection.

146
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:28,202
It'll take 7 to 10 days.

147
00:16:30,582 --> 00:16:31,962
When are you going?

148
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,791
I've already contacted the interviewee. I can go anytime.

149
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,040
Alone?

150
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,471
Who else can I go with?

151
00:16:42,526 --> 00:16:44,355
Send me the hotel and flight information.

152
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:50,049
Showing concern and offering comfort is a demonstration of true affection.

153
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,782
Yu You and I are just ordinary friends.

154
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,882
Ordinary friends who are more ordinary than ordinary.

155
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,479
Instead of speculating about what may be between him and me,

156
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,560
you'd better worry about Yue.

157
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:10,590
She's the one who's eager.

158
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,871
I don't have that much imagination.

159
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,562
Nor do I have that much free time.

160
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,040
Are you just not going to care about your niece?

161
00:17:18,254 --> 00:17:20,494
Do you really think we have a little fool in our family?

162
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,829
She is very smart.

163
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:33,340
Mr. Shi, Mr. Chen said the meeting today will be canceled.

164
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,600
Why?

165
00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:37,808
Mr. Chen said there was a problem on his side.

166
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,071
He didn't say anything more specific.

167
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,180
Go prepare some coffee. We'll go to Le'an.

168
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,600
Okay, Mr. Shi.

169
00:17:50,629 --> 00:17:52,229
- Thanks for your hard work. - Thanks.

170
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,302
Thanks for your hard work.

171
00:17:57,359 --> 00:17:58,359
Mr. Shi.

172
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,080
Isn't our meeting canceled?

173
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,341
What are you doing?

174
00:18:02,461 --> 00:18:03,799
Everyone has been working hard lately.

175
00:18:03,823 --> 00:18:06,280
I brought some coffee to cheer everyone up.

176
00:18:06,368 --> 00:18:07,958
Thanks, Mr. Shi.

177
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,710
Yunchuang won't give up on Le'an.

178
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,320
You should also keep up the good work.

179
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,579
Thanks, Mr. Shi.

180
00:18:17,632 --> 00:18:20,362
The people here in Le'an are dispirited and low in morale.

181
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,090
I feel like we're losing our motivation.

182
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,840
Chen Kang.

183
00:18:27,447 --> 00:18:29,367
Only a clear-headed and determined manager

184
00:18:29,448 --> 00:18:30,894
can get Le'an back on track.

185
00:18:30,998 --> 00:18:32,559
I believe as long as you are here,

186
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,440
Le'an will definitely be able to get through this difficult situation.

187
00:18:37,162 --> 00:18:41,344
But the laboratory has always been working according to Bruce's rhythm.

188
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,922
He is indeed able to lead everyone in terms of technology.

189
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,360
It's hard for us to find someone to replace him in a short time.

190
00:18:48,901 --> 00:18:50,961
You also started from a technical position.

191
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,381
The team trusts you.

192
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,460
I can't do it.

193
00:18:54,876 --> 00:18:57,696
I have been focusing on management for these few years.

194
00:18:58,089 --> 00:19:00,238
I haven't been on the front line of R&D for a long time.

195
00:19:00,262 --> 00:19:01,812
But, you are the soul of Le'an.

196
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,430
You can't escape.

197
00:19:06,797 --> 00:19:08,317
Where there is a will, there is a way.

198
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,960
The one who caused the problem should be the one to solve it.

199
00:19:13,608 --> 00:19:14,608
Mr. Shi.

200
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,573
Will Le'an cause you a lot of trouble if it fails?

201
00:19:21,781 --> 00:19:23,371
Victory and defeat are common in war.

202
00:19:24,117 --> 00:19:26,082
Both Yunchuang and Le'an are still young.

203
00:19:26,295 --> 00:19:29,325
We may fall, but we should never be afraid of falling.

204
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,440
I understand.

205
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,341
Don't worry, Mr. Shi.

206
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,439
I will definitely lead Le'an to regain its glory.

207
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,480
Hello.

208
00:20:09,325 --> 00:20:10,488
Okay, I got it.

209
00:20:18,653 --> 00:20:19,802
Shu Yi.

210
00:20:20,038 --> 00:20:21,482
I have a meeting tomorrow.

211
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,739
I can't send you.

212
00:20:23,629 --> 00:20:25,699
I'll ask Fan to send you to the airport.

213
00:20:46,486 --> 00:20:47,622
You're mad.

214
00:20:51,982 --> 00:20:53,371
Fairy.

215
00:20:55,976 --> 00:20:58,887
Little fairy, don't be mad.

216
00:21:07,675 --> 00:21:09,856
Where are you going? You're so impatient.

217
00:21:10,829 --> 00:21:12,740
I'm going to cook noodles for the fairy.

218
00:21:31,877 --> 00:21:33,783
Have you told the editor? What time is the flight?

219
00:21:33,807 --> 00:21:34,807
Tomorrow morning.

220
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,849
Shu Yi and Nan, I'm back.

221
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,322
You're back.

222
00:21:40,477 --> 00:21:41,951
I've been wanting to come back.

223
00:21:42,032 --> 00:21:43,443
I miss you guys so much.

224
00:21:43,524 --> 00:21:45,922
I'm now eager to get to work.

225
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,720
This doesn't sound like you.

226
00:21:50,445 --> 00:21:51,564
You came back just in time.

227
00:21:51,645 --> 00:21:53,002
There's a job just right for you.

228
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,362
What?

229
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,002
Going on a business trip with me.

230
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:58,116
Got it.

231
00:22:04,716 --> 00:22:06,016
Please take a seat, both of you.

232
00:22:07,577 --> 00:22:08,583
Hello, Mr. Luo.

233
00:22:08,664 --> 00:22:10,361
I'm Zheng Shu Yi, a journalist from the Finance Introduce.

234
00:22:10,385 --> 00:22:12,322
This is Qin Shi Yue, an intern journalist.

235
00:22:12,542 --> 00:22:13,542
Hello, both of you.

236
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:16,194
Miss Zheng, I've heard a lot about you.

237
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,561
Oh, I'm flattered.

238
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,229
Mr. Luo, let's get started.

239
00:22:22,624 --> 00:22:25,120
Mr. Luo, as a successful returnee,

240
00:22:25,204 --> 00:22:28,402
can you give some practical advice to those who are still abroad?

241
00:22:29,612 --> 00:22:31,282
Actually, my advice is very simple.

242
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,320
Look around the world and never forget your original intention.

243
00:22:58,359 --> 00:22:59,718
Done. How is it?

244
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:01,442
Looks good? Look.

245
00:23:01,792 --> 00:23:03,122
This one looks good.

246
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,499
No bad.

247
00:23:06,976 --> 00:23:08,699
Shu Yi, you took pictures but didn't send them.

248
00:23:08,723 --> 00:23:10,082
Isn't that a bit wasteful?

249
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,023
To whom should I send them?

250
00:23:35,807 --> 00:23:36,907
(Finished work?)

251
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:39,282
Surprisingly, it went smoothly.

252
00:23:39,358 --> 00:23:40,802
The interviewee was very talkative.

253
00:23:41,511 --> 00:23:44,642
Now that it's done, why haven't you returned yet?

254
00:23:45,532 --> 00:23:47,842
It's my first time in Qionghai.

255
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,602
It's really beautiful here.

256
00:23:49,768 --> 00:23:51,677
(Yue can help me take pictures.)

257
00:23:51,819 --> 00:23:53,776
(I really want to take two days off and have some fun.)

258
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,800
Shu Yi.

259
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,562
Shu Yi doesn't know how far Jiangcheng is from her.

260
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,562
Shi Yan's longing gaze at Shu Yi.

261
00:24:10,981 --> 00:24:12,362
But, I miss you more.

262
00:24:26,607 --> 00:24:28,796
Yue Xing Zhou, look!

263
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,402
Your recent work is full of issues.

264
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:35,576
This time, due to a mistake on your part,

265
00:24:35,657 --> 00:24:37,458
the entire department had to pitch in to rectify the situation.

266
00:24:37,482 --> 00:24:39,322
I can't explain the situation to them now.

267
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,271
- Mr. Hong. - All right, you don't have to explain.

268
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,762
I won't make things hard for you.

269
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,122
You go to the HR department

270
00:24:49,258 --> 00:24:50,778
and handle the resignation procedures.

271
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:55,463
Mr. Hong, I...

272
00:25:22,368 --> 00:25:24,762
Hey, what are you banging on so late at night?

273
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,280
Xing Zhou.

274
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,200
What is this?

275
00:26:02,388 --> 00:26:03,648
Shu Yi.

276
00:26:04,832 --> 00:26:05,892
Shu Yi.

277
00:26:12,822 --> 00:26:14,082
Yue Xing Zhou.

278
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,602
Who am I to you?

279
00:26:16,507 --> 00:26:19,282
You are looking at Zheng Shu Yi's photos in front of me.

280
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,908
You don't need to meddle.

281
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,620
Yue Xing Zhou.

282
00:26:31,065 --> 00:26:32,894
I'm your girlfriend.

283
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,911
Do you know how much I have done for you?

284
00:26:40,653 --> 00:26:42,082
You wanted to buy a car.

285
00:26:42,845 --> 00:26:44,325
I asked my parents to buy it for you.

286
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,071
You wanted to go to Yunchuang. I helped you find connections.

287
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,949
You have no conscience.

288
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:52,722
What's the use?

289
00:26:53,156 --> 00:26:54,505
You are just a liar.

290
00:26:55,061 --> 00:26:56,650
You made me lose Shu Yi.

291
00:26:57,216 --> 00:26:58,845
Now, I don't even have a job.

292
00:27:00,804 --> 00:27:01,943
I harmed you?

293
00:27:02,462 --> 00:27:05,212
It's all your own doing.

294
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:09,249
I truly loved you.

295
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,842
Did you love me?

296
00:27:11,998 --> 00:27:13,628
Did you love Zheng Shu Yi?

297
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,659
You didn't.

298
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,989
You only love money and your future.

299
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,442
You love whoever can give you what you want.

300
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,886
You found out I can't give you what you want,

301
00:27:23,005 --> 00:27:24,485
then you remember Zheng Shu Yi again.

302
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,550
Who do you think you are?

303
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,708
Leave. Go ahead and see if Zheng Shu Yi will pay any attention to you.

304
00:27:37,825 --> 00:27:39,758
She's by Shi Yan's side now. She won't even look at you,

305
00:27:39,782 --> 00:27:41,372
let alone come back to you.

306
00:27:41,713 --> 00:27:43,543
No one will want you except me.

307
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,122
Mr. Shi.

308
00:28:36,637 --> 00:28:39,548
Mr. Shi, I have something to say to you.

309
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,120
My boy...

310
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,459
My ex-boyfriend.

311
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,680
He still has feelings for Zheng Shu Yi.

312
00:28:49,967 --> 00:28:52,068
- Do you know? - What if I know?

313
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,469
What if I don't know?

314
00:29:03,171 --> 00:29:04,681
You probably don't know me well.

315
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,817
I'm not a very good person. I'm very self-centered.

316
00:29:07,921 --> 00:29:10,362
If you come to upset me again,

317
00:29:10,543 --> 00:29:13,453
then I'll settle the old score for Zheng Shu Yi.

318
00:29:14,014 --> 00:29:15,074
Can you understand?

319
00:29:35,837 --> 00:29:38,277
Mr. Shi is not available. He asked me to pick up both of you.

320
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,739
No need, Mr. Fan.

321
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:42,799
How are you going back?

322
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,682
It's a secret.

323
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,720
Yue.

324
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,240
Yu You.

325
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:00,839
Let's go around again.

326
00:30:02,732 --> 00:30:03,802
You're finally back.

327
00:30:03,951 --> 00:30:05,042
I miss you.

328
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,162
Let's go home.

329
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,305
Thank you, Mr. Fan.

330
00:30:20,386 --> 00:30:21,750
No problem. It's my duty.

331
00:30:22,058 --> 00:30:23,738
If there's nothing else, I'll leave.

332
00:30:23,819 --> 00:30:24,819
Bye.

333
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,480
Everyone, thank you for your hard work.

334
00:31:23,967 --> 00:31:24,967
Mr. Shi.

335
00:31:25,373 --> 00:31:27,254
Actually, even I don't know

336
00:31:27,407 --> 00:31:29,837
if Le'an can make it through this time.

337
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,322
But you are Le'an's benefactor,

338
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,480
my friend.

339
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,030
I will never forget this.

340
00:31:37,181 --> 00:31:38,961
If there's a problem, we'll solve it.

341
00:31:39,348 --> 00:31:40,607
I still believe in Le'an.

342
00:31:40,688 --> 00:31:41,728
I believe in all of you.

343
00:31:41,872 --> 00:31:43,116
A toast for everyone.

344
00:31:43,489 --> 00:31:44,494
Thank you, Mr. Shi.

345
00:31:44,575 --> 00:31:47,000
- Let's work hard together. - Good.

346
00:31:55,201 --> 00:31:57,202
(I already sent Miss Zheng home.)

347
00:31:57,497 --> 00:31:59,160
(But, I saw her ex-boyfriend)

348
00:31:59,241 --> 00:32:01,340
(hanging around her house.)

349
00:32:06,628 --> 00:32:08,259
Everyone, excuse me for a moment.

350
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:11,549
Why did Mr. Shi leave?

351
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Shu Yi.

352
00:32:27,803 --> 00:32:28,908
What do you want to do?

353
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:30,411
Yue Xing Zhou, listen.

354
00:32:30,518 --> 00:32:32,842
This is called trespassing. I can call the police.

355
00:32:32,989 --> 00:32:35,362
Shu Yi, I'm sorry.

356
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,082
I know I let you down.

357
00:32:37,351 --> 00:32:39,282
If you want to repent, go somewhere else.

358
00:32:39,352 --> 00:32:41,261
This isn't a garbage dump.

359
00:32:43,269 --> 00:32:44,562
Let go.

360
00:32:45,205 --> 00:32:46,225
Shu Yi.

361
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,391
Do you really have no feelings for me?

362
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,830
What are you looking at?

363
00:33:29,124 --> 00:33:30,522
I'm watching you,

364
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:36,189
disheveled and captivated by my kiss.

365
00:33:51,816 --> 00:33:53,082
Wait until I come back.

366
00:33:55,121 --> 00:33:56,362
Are you leaving?

367
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,670
You don't want me to go?

368
00:34:00,998 --> 00:34:02,037
No.

369
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:04,190
You can go. I'm going to sleep.

370
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,430
Don't sleep. Wait for me.

371
00:34:16,772 --> 00:34:18,722
Don't open the door for strangers either.

372
00:34:18,803 --> 00:34:20,162
Did you hear me?

373
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,002
Got it. You should go now.

374
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,562
Don't appear in front of her again.

375
00:34:39,655 --> 00:34:40,885
Can you do that?

376
00:34:41,137 --> 00:34:43,377
- We two... - You guys have already ended it long ago.

377
00:34:43,879 --> 00:34:45,642
If you still have any thoughts,

378
00:34:45,761 --> 00:34:47,322
it's best to get rid of them soon.

379
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,780
If I see you troubling her again,

380
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,871
I can't guarantee

381
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:09,939
what I'll do.

382
00:35:14,398 --> 00:35:15,602
Go away yourself.

383
00:35:15,749 --> 00:35:17,009
Don't let me help you.

384
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,922
You're back so soon?

385
00:35:47,552 --> 00:35:48,597
Sorry.

386
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,482
Something unexpected happened on the way here just now, so I'm late.

387
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:54,359
Can you not complain about me?

388
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,600
It's okay.

389
00:35:57,242 --> 00:35:58,319
Thank you so much.

390
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,240
Should I send you a red packet?

391
00:36:00,351 --> 00:36:02,591
I'm late and yet you still want to give me a red packet.

392
00:36:03,377 --> 00:36:05,017
Is she out of her mind due to starvation?

393
00:36:05,269 --> 00:36:06,599
Enjoy your meal. Thank you.

394
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,802
- Thank you. - Thank you.

395
00:36:19,905 --> 00:36:21,106
Hey, what's up?

396
00:36:21,187 --> 00:36:23,086
Are you with Shi Yan?

397
00:36:23,746 --> 00:36:25,248
Why didn't I realize earlier that

398
00:36:25,329 --> 00:36:27,091
you tend to prioritize guys over friends?

399
00:36:27,864 --> 00:36:28,964
He just left.

400
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,391
I didn't meet the right person before.

401
00:36:32,551 --> 00:36:34,922
That's enough. I don't want to hear it.

402
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:38,006
A blind cat stumbled upon a stroke of luck and caught a dead mouse.

403
00:36:38,316 --> 00:36:41,082
Who's the dead mouse? Who's the blind cat?

404
00:36:41,247 --> 00:36:43,082
(That person knows herself.)

405
00:36:43,602 --> 00:36:46,042
You just came back from Qionghai tonight, right?

406
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,680
What were you guys doing just now?

407
00:36:47,823 --> 00:36:48,844
Just now...

408
00:36:50,818 --> 00:36:52,882
(Say something.)

409
00:36:54,548 --> 00:36:56,802
No way, Zheng Shu Yi.

410
00:36:57,023 --> 00:36:59,162
You're impressive.

411
00:36:59,738 --> 00:37:01,762
What nonsense are you talking about?

412
00:37:02,619 --> 00:37:04,289
We just

413
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,832
kissed, you know?

414
00:37:07,964 --> 00:37:09,082
(Kiss.)

415
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,580
Okay.

416
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,122
Nothing else happened.

417
00:37:13,557 --> 00:37:15,162
He's busy too.

418
00:37:15,362 --> 00:37:17,233
He took time out to come find me.

419
00:37:18,985 --> 00:37:21,882
If I had known he would forgive you so easily,

420
00:37:21,974 --> 00:37:24,162
(I wouldn't have worried so much before.)

421
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:52,349
(Don't sleep. Wait for me.)

422
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,522
Where do you want to go?

423
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,300
I want to go to your heart.

424
00:38:27,515 --> 00:38:28,515
What's wrong?

425
00:38:29,242 --> 00:38:31,543
Who am I to you? How can you enter my house?

426
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,389
I'm your landlord.

427
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,989
(Is this area his property too?)

428
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:48,469
Weren't you going to my heart?

429
00:38:50,447 --> 00:38:51,996
How much did you drink?

430
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,280
Not much.

431
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,109
He is quite at ease.

432
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,960
You're drunk.

433
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,922
A little bit.

434
00:39:31,457 --> 00:39:33,042
I've heard that

435
00:39:33,142 --> 00:39:35,242
people who wear glasses for a long time

436
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,242
don't like others touching their glasses.

437
00:39:37,507 --> 00:39:39,162
If they take off their glasses,

438
00:39:39,289 --> 00:39:41,159
they will have a strong sense of insecurity.

439
00:40:10,768 --> 00:40:12,279
I just wanted to see

440
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,950
if you can still see clearly without the glasses.

441
00:40:21,103 --> 00:40:22,922
As long as I can see you clearly, it's fine.

442
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,110
(What's wrong with this man after drinking?)

443
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:29,389
(How did he become another person?)

444
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:42,750
Will you still remember what happened today once you sober up?

445
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,791
What happened today?

446
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,002
Call me darling.

447
00:40:55,878 --> 00:40:57,138
Call me darling.

448
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:00,939
Darling.

449
00:41:05,948 --> 00:41:08,882
Will you really remember what you said today tomorrow?

450
00:41:09,375 --> 00:41:12,922
Will you wake up and become that cold-hearted again?

451
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,282
Cold-hearted.

452
00:41:21,756 --> 00:41:23,362
Don't you like it too?

453
00:41:23,656 --> 00:41:24,656
I don't care.

454
00:41:25,022 --> 00:41:26,692
If you don't remember tomorrow,

455
00:41:26,874 --> 00:41:29,745
I'll write an article exposing your abandonment.

456
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,562
Let's keep some evidence.

457
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,880
You...

458
00:41:55,061 --> 00:41:56,361
This is the evidence.

459
00:41:57,199 --> 00:41:58,199
Keep it.

460
00:42:03,023 --> 00:42:04,402
Hold me a bit longer.

461
00:42:23,342 --> 00:42:24,482
Are you feeling unwell?

462
00:42:28,678 --> 00:42:30,562
I'll go get you something to sober up.
