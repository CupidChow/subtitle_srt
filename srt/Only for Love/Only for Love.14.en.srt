00:01:30,802 --> 00:01:36,049
(Only For Love)

2
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,962
(Episode 14)

3
00:02:09,002 --> 00:02:10,242
(It's been a busy day.)

4
00:02:10,325 --> 00:02:12,395
(Now I'm craving some late-night snacks.)

5
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,682
Busy?

6
00:02:17,321 --> 00:02:18,847
What has she been up to?

7
00:02:56,657 --> 00:02:58,842
Yue, what's wrong?

8
00:02:59,156 --> 00:03:01,794
I'm trying to contact some industry experts.

9
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:06,682
Is it still about that article you were working on?

10
00:03:06,898 --> 00:03:10,703
Yu Ling suggested we get some big names to endorse it.

11
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:15,457
But I think the experts you found before should suffice.

12
00:03:17,092 --> 00:03:18,097
Yue,

13
00:03:18,249 --> 00:03:20,299
when we write an article, we're sharing our insights

14
00:03:20,323 --> 00:03:21,579
and communicating with our readers.

15
00:03:21,603 --> 00:03:23,963
It's not just about regurgitating others' viewpoints.

16
00:03:24,085 --> 00:03:26,922
A good article isn't a mere jumble of technical terms.

17
00:03:27,054 --> 00:03:29,642
You shouldn't rely solely on others

18
00:03:29,761 --> 00:03:31,362
to lend authority to your work.

19
00:03:31,643 --> 00:03:33,390
But Yu Ling said...

20
00:03:33,471 --> 00:03:35,591
You've been working for a while now.

21
00:03:35,754 --> 00:03:38,926
You should learn to make your own judgments about what others say.

22
00:03:39,257 --> 00:03:40,820
I reviewed your initial outline.

23
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:43,543
The structure looks fine, and the information is thorough.

24
00:03:43,763 --> 00:03:44,843
What you need to do now

25
00:03:44,923 --> 00:03:47,243
is enrich the content based on the initial draft

26
00:03:47,412 --> 00:03:49,002
and adjust some wording.

27
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,363
Look, show me your initial draft.

28
00:03:53,443 --> 00:03:54,483
We'll go over it together.

29
00:03:54,538 --> 00:03:57,322
If there are any unclear points, we can seek further confirmation.

30
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,390
Hello.

31
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,657
I'm Kong Nan, a journalist from Financial Introduce.

32
00:04:07,422 --> 00:04:09,842
Is Mr. Qin still on his way?

33
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:13,759
It's okay. Let's chat for a while first.

34
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:16,509
When Mr. Qin arrives, we can formally begin.

35
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,602
Miss, I think you've mistaken me for someone else.

36
00:04:22,946 --> 00:04:25,042
Aren't you Mr. Chen Sheng?

37
00:04:25,134 --> 00:04:27,202
I'm sorry. You've got the wrong person.

38
00:04:27,451 --> 00:04:28,682
Miss Kong.

39
00:04:35,597 --> 00:04:37,219
I'm sorry. I got the wrong person. Sorry.

40
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:38,482
It's okay.

41
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,651
Are you Chen Sheng?

42
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,082
Yes, I am. Hello, Miss Kong.

43
00:04:46,944 --> 00:04:48,250
Nice to meet you.

44
00:04:48,752 --> 00:04:50,072
How old are you?

45
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,300
I'm 25.

46
00:04:54,475 --> 00:04:56,275
Did you start working right after graduating?

47
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:58,600
Yes, I joined Yunchuang right after graduation

48
00:04:58,683 --> 00:05:00,434
and started working with Mr. Shi.

49
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,200
The way you talk to me on WeChat doesn't seem like

50
00:05:04,267 --> 00:05:06,162
someone from the post-90s generation.

51
00:05:07,482 --> 00:05:10,943
Well, I might come across as more mature when I'm at work.

52
00:05:22,557 --> 00:05:25,556
You're a really fast learner, Yue. You're getting there.

53
00:05:25,722 --> 00:05:27,222
Thank you, Shu Yi.

54
00:05:28,818 --> 00:05:30,682
It's getting so late. Let's call it a day.

55
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,912
You should go home now.

56
00:05:31,993 --> 00:05:34,891
Tomorrow, go through it again and check it thoroughly.

57
00:05:39,023 --> 00:05:40,202
Yes!

58
00:05:45,376 --> 00:05:46,376
(Have you had dinner?)

59
00:05:46,482 --> 00:05:47,982
(How was your day?)

60
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,459
(Today was great.)

61
00:05:50,602 --> 00:05:53,402
(Shu Yi is back. She's been mentoring me closely.)

62
00:05:53,577 --> 00:05:56,219
(Your beloved niece here is a fast learner.)

63
00:05:56,338 --> 00:05:59,078
(We managed to finish our work just before midnight.)

64
00:06:01,042 --> 00:06:04,804
(Shu Yi is amazing, so professional and patient.)

65
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,059
(She has so much on her plate, )

66
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:08,242
(yet she stayed with me to work this late.)

67
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:15,002
Shu Yi, I'll head out now.

68
00:06:15,104 --> 00:06:16,544
You shouldn't stay too late either.

69
00:06:16,771 --> 00:06:18,370
Go home now. Stay safe.

70
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,000
- Bye. - Bye.

71
00:06:39,474 --> 00:06:42,594
Shi Yan hasn't contacted me all day.

72
00:06:59,496 --> 00:07:02,046
(Yes, I'm not alone.)

73
00:07:02,352 --> 00:07:05,142
(Can someone help deliver a bed to the magazine office?)

74
00:07:12,387 --> 00:07:13,642
Perfect.

75
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,352
(Come downstairs.)

76
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,242
(Coming!)

77
00:07:36,042 --> 00:07:37,242
Miss Zheng.

78
00:07:38,362 --> 00:07:39,698
Did you just finish work?

79
00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:41,219
Yes, I had to work late.

80
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,580
It must be tough for you.

81
00:07:42,722 --> 00:07:44,222
It's not easy for you either.

82
00:07:44,544 --> 00:07:47,042
By the way, I guess you probably haven't eaten anything

83
00:07:47,123 --> 00:07:48,482
working so late.

84
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,481
These egg tarts are freshly heated for you.

85
00:07:50,505 --> 00:07:52,945
Would you like to take them with you to eat on your way home?

86
00:07:56,299 --> 00:07:57,940
I reserved them just for you.

87
00:07:58,036 --> 00:07:59,436
If you don't want them,

88
00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:01,168
I'll have to throw them away.

89
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,395
Thank you. How much is it? I'll transfer it to you.

90
00:08:06,476 --> 00:08:07,555
It's fine.

91
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,560
My supervisor has already settled the accounts.

92
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:12,857
Are you waiting for a ride?

93
00:08:13,012 --> 00:08:14,172
It's quite cold tonight,

94
00:08:14,284 --> 00:08:15,564
and it's not safe to wait alone.

95
00:08:15,683 --> 00:08:18,102
How about I stay with you for a while?

96
00:08:18,976 --> 00:08:20,282
I...

97
00:08:22,681 --> 00:08:24,003
Let's go.

98
00:08:26,737 --> 00:08:28,237
Have you paid him?

99
00:08:35,129 --> 00:08:36,629
Show me your QR code.

100
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:48,842
Thanks.

101
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:52,909
Haven't you chatted enough with him?

102
00:08:53,123 --> 00:08:54,282
We're done.

103
00:08:56,114 --> 00:08:57,568
What brings you by?

104
00:08:57,673 --> 00:08:58,962
It's on my way.

105
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:04,178
Miss Zheng, you seem quite popular.

106
00:09:05,072 --> 00:09:06,442
Just average.

107
00:09:06,523 --> 00:09:08,553
About as much as you, Mr. Shi.

108
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,162
Are you hungry?

109
00:09:53,185 --> 00:09:54,802
Would you like to have some?

110
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,960
It's late. I'll pass.

111
00:10:03,557 --> 00:10:04,630
If you don't sit in the front seat,

112
00:10:04,654 --> 00:10:06,482
you would make me look like your driver.

113
00:10:09,091 --> 00:10:11,562
- Easy there, Mr. Wang. - All right.

114
00:10:12,259 --> 00:10:15,482
- Bye, Xu. - I'll wait for your confirmation on the interview time.

115
00:10:17,345 --> 00:10:19,602
Good night, Mr. Wang. Bye.

116
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,362
Zheng Shu Yi?

117
00:10:32,175 --> 00:10:33,442
Shi Yan!

118
00:10:36,372 --> 00:10:37,922
They really are dating.

119
00:10:47,163 --> 00:10:48,712
Who's talking behind my back?

120
00:11:15,917 --> 00:11:18,522
(The dangers of late-night snacking)

121
00:11:23,548 --> 00:11:25,538
Where are we going?

122
00:11:25,955 --> 00:11:27,202
Late-night snack.

123
00:11:28,369 --> 00:11:30,377
Didn't you say we shouldn't have late-night snacks?

124
00:11:30,401 --> 00:11:32,738
Given your routine, this meal can't be considered a late-night snack.

125
00:11:32,762 --> 00:11:34,262
It's just a late dinner.

126
00:11:35,064 --> 00:11:36,580
Can we really do that?

127
00:11:38,722 --> 00:11:40,041
Can I choose what to eat then?

128
00:11:40,122 --> 00:11:41,622
I only want noodles.

129
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:46,063
Do you know the way?

130
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,660
Turn right at the next intersection!

131
00:12:06,795 --> 00:12:07,828
Thank you.

132
00:12:12,038 --> 00:12:13,722
You're really not going to try some?

133
00:12:14,016 --> 00:12:16,979
Their signature seafood noodles are incredibly delicious.

134
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,739
With every bite, you'll taste the freshness,

135
00:12:18,763 --> 00:12:20,083
and it leaves a lingering flavor.

136
00:12:20,185 --> 00:12:21,562
No, thanks.

137
00:12:24,396 --> 00:12:26,402
Their noodles are really good.

138
00:12:26,482 --> 00:12:28,352
You'd be missing out if you don't try them.

139
00:12:28,762 --> 00:12:30,922
They're best when served fresh,

140
00:12:31,002 --> 00:12:32,003
so they don't do takeout.

141
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,778
If you want to enjoy them, you have to dine in.

142
00:12:33,802 --> 00:12:35,079
It gets crowded during the day,

143
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,240
and sometimes you have to wait for a table at night.

144
00:12:37,683 --> 00:12:39,393
I rarely eat here after starting work.

145
00:12:39,571 --> 00:12:42,011
Back when I was in college, I used to come here often with...

146
00:12:47,888 --> 00:12:49,042
Here you go.

147
00:12:49,704 --> 00:12:50,842
Thank you.

148
00:13:09,425 --> 00:13:11,202
Xing Zhou, let's have dinner here tonight.

149
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,602
Sure. Let's go.

150
00:13:15,722 --> 00:13:18,342
Excuse me, I need to use the restroom.

151
00:13:22,722 --> 00:13:24,243
Five bowls of seafood noodles, please.

152
00:13:24,338 --> 00:13:25,442
You got it.

153
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,363
- Let's have a drink, guys. - Sure.

154
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:32,943
It's been a long time.

155
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,320
Xing Zhou, we've been classmates for so many years.

156
00:13:37,403 --> 00:13:38,723
You've got to be honest with us.

157
00:13:38,803 --> 00:13:40,832
Why did you and Zheng Shu Yi suddenly broke up?

158
00:13:41,442 --> 00:13:43,242
- Tell us. - Yes, tell us.

159
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,395
We're just incompatible.

160
00:13:44,476 --> 00:13:46,082
So, who initiated the breakup?

161
00:13:46,962 --> 00:13:48,122
She did.

162
00:13:48,721 --> 00:13:50,001
That's normal.

163
00:13:50,122 --> 00:13:52,322
She's interacting with a different crowd now,

164
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,202
and her standards have risen.

165
00:13:54,268 --> 00:13:58,148
When she's surrounded by CEOs and CFOs every day,

166
00:13:58,229 --> 00:13:59,526
how could she still be interested in

167
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,110
a small tech company employee like you?

168
00:14:02,203 --> 00:14:04,003
You guys enjoy dinner. I've lost my appetite.

169
00:14:04,547 --> 00:14:05,587
Xing Zhou...

170
00:14:05,667 --> 00:14:07,347
- Xing Zhou! - Xing Zhou!

171
00:14:07,442 --> 00:14:09,362
- Where are you going, Xing Zhou? - Xing Zhou!

172
00:14:09,443 --> 00:14:10,762
Xing Zhou!

173
00:14:20,043 --> 00:14:21,762
(Need me to go and pick you up?)

174
00:14:30,163 --> 00:14:32,202
Sorry to keep you waiting.

175
00:14:44,481 --> 00:14:46,242
Zheng Shu Yi, look up.

176
00:14:48,043 --> 00:14:49,202
What?

177
00:14:52,722 --> 00:14:54,802
Do I have something on my face?

178
00:14:57,831 --> 00:14:59,349
Nothing there.

179
00:14:59,671 --> 00:15:01,171
Still as beautiful as ever.

180
00:15:05,589 --> 00:15:07,089
What's going on?

181
00:15:09,147 --> 00:15:10,977
With such big eyes,

182
00:15:11,252 --> 00:15:12,922
yet why do you have such bad taste?

183
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:16,680
Why are you suddenly attacking me?

184
00:15:17,244 --> 00:15:19,553
(Could he have guessed something?)

185
00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:24,110
(That couldn't be. He doesn't know Yue Xing Zhou.)

186
00:15:26,443 --> 00:15:28,722
Yes, you're right.

187
00:15:28,963 --> 00:15:31,274
I used to have poor taste before,

188
00:15:32,842 --> 00:15:35,472
but it has improved a lot.

189
00:15:38,644 --> 00:15:40,634
Now your standards are too high for you.

190
00:15:45,563 --> 00:15:47,832
It's like playing the lute to a cow.

191
00:15:48,043 --> 00:15:49,322
Pardon me?

192
00:15:49,516 --> 00:15:50,556
I said you're like a cow.

193
00:15:50,651 --> 00:15:51,962
Zheng Shu Yi.

194
00:15:52,923 --> 00:15:54,229
I'm sorry.

195
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,220
Still want to finish your noodle?

196
00:15:59,355 --> 00:16:01,442
No, I've lost my appetite.

197
00:16:09,157 --> 00:16:11,562
He's a cow who has no sense of romance,

198
00:16:11,648 --> 00:16:13,602
with no self-awareness at all.

199
00:16:23,243 --> 00:16:25,363
(Nothing good ever happens when I meet that cheater.)

200
00:16:25,482 --> 00:16:26,738
(I couldn't even finish my noodles.)

201
00:16:26,762 --> 00:16:28,562
(Now I'm hungry and tired, )

202
00:16:28,712 --> 00:16:31,082
(with an unhappy cow beside me.)

203
00:16:36,642 --> 00:16:38,722
(Why is he in such a bad mood?)

204
00:17:21,049 --> 00:17:22,362
We're here?

205
00:17:23,527 --> 00:17:25,015
I should go home then.

206
00:17:25,096 --> 00:17:26,362
Drive safe.

207
00:17:41,442 --> 00:17:42,722
Zheng Shu Yi.

208
00:17:45,177 --> 00:17:46,362
What?

209
00:17:46,758 --> 00:17:48,258
Don't eat before going to bed.

210
00:17:50,483 --> 00:17:53,282
Sleeping on an empty stomach not only causes low blood sugar

211
00:17:53,362 --> 00:17:55,082
but also affects sleep quality.

212
00:17:55,162 --> 00:17:56,643
Mr. Shi, take care of yourself,

213
00:17:56,723 --> 00:17:58,203
and I'll take care of myself.

214
00:17:58,402 --> 00:17:59,482
Bye.

215
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,389
Why is it empty?

216
00:18:31,618 --> 00:18:34,675
Forget it. I'll just order a food delivery.

217
00:18:46,428 --> 00:18:48,162
I'm not going to listen to you.

218
00:18:48,233 --> 00:18:49,943
You're not the one who's starving.

219
00:19:12,379 --> 00:19:14,082
I'm hungry.

220
00:19:15,161 --> 00:19:16,922
How long till my food gets here?

221
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,122
Coming. Give me a minute.

222
00:19:33,307 --> 00:19:35,017
I didn't order this.

223
00:19:45,243 --> 00:19:46,953
(Open the door. Get your food.)

224
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:04,753
He's actually pretty considerate and sweet.

225
00:21:05,484 --> 00:21:08,835
He even delivered Jiuwei's noodles to me personally.

226
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:11,619
Maybe he does care about me.

227
00:21:42,872 --> 00:21:44,382
(This is so good.)

228
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:50,017
(You don't eat green onions?)

229
00:21:52,362 --> 00:21:53,482
(Yes.)

230
00:21:56,424 --> 00:21:59,194
(Are you this considerate with your ex-girlfriend too?)

231
00:22:01,746 --> 00:22:03,825
(I'm just like you.)

232
00:22:06,649 --> 00:22:08,758
(Could it be that he found out?)

233
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,602
(Why did I bring up his ex-girlfriend?)

234
00:22:13,714 --> 00:22:16,917
(And I sound jealous.)

235
00:22:17,005 --> 00:22:18,747
(He's probably mocking me.)

236
00:22:20,402 --> 00:22:21,682
Zheng Shu Yi,

237
00:22:22,283 --> 00:22:24,303
why do you care about what Shi Yan thinks?

238
00:22:25,047 --> 00:22:27,002
There is no way I'm jealous.

239
00:22:27,232 --> 00:22:30,522
If anything, it should be his ex-girlfriend who's jealous

240
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,100
that I can have food delivered by Shi Yan himself.

241
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,630
(Don't starve yourself for someone unimportant again.)

242
00:23:15,169 --> 00:23:17,842
Nan Nan, pour me a cup.

243
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,600
I just bought it. I haven't had it yet.

244
00:23:21,657 --> 00:23:22,882
You can have it.

245
00:23:25,345 --> 00:23:26,915
Morning, Yu Ling.

246
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,900
What's wrong with her?

247
00:23:31,445 --> 00:23:33,562
Do I look like I know?

248
00:23:40,572 --> 00:23:42,682
It's not poisoned, is it?

249
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,562
Let's begin the meeting.

250
00:23:51,233 --> 00:23:52,602
Shu Yi, go turn on the lights.

251
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:53,882
I'll go.

252
00:24:14,499 --> 00:24:15,922
Today's class is interesting.

253
00:24:16,068 --> 00:24:18,428
We're going to talk about a favorite topic of ours,

254
00:24:18,673 --> 00:24:19,717
money.

255
00:24:21,162 --> 00:24:25,392
Of course, we will primarily discuss the supply and demand for money.

256
00:24:25,842 --> 00:24:27,362
Before we begin,

257
00:24:27,443 --> 00:24:30,723
let's first review the monetary system in our country.

258
00:24:38,232 --> 00:24:40,209
New Year's Day is approaching, and the holidays are coming.

259
00:24:40,233 --> 00:24:42,562
Before the New Year, make sure to wrap up your work.

260
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:45,078
Additionally, Guan Capital is hosting a thank-you dinner.

261
00:24:49,482 --> 00:24:51,962
Yu Ling, Guan Capital is your client.

262
00:24:52,087 --> 00:24:53,587
You should attend.

263
00:24:54,073 --> 00:24:56,562
Editor, I've scheduled other interviews on that day.

264
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,161
Shu Yi should go.

265
00:25:01,451 --> 00:25:02,682
What did you say?

266
00:25:03,689 --> 00:25:06,450
I have other arrangements on that day. Shu Yi going is more suitable.

267
00:25:10,699 --> 00:25:11,775
What's wrong with her?

268
00:25:11,872 --> 00:25:13,372
Is she under a spell?

269
00:25:15,918 --> 00:25:18,799
I've been busy with a feature on new energy vehicle batteries recently,

270
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,240
so I might not have the time.

271
00:25:20,412 --> 00:25:21,812
How about sending Kong Nan instead?

272
00:25:22,602 --> 00:25:23,883
Me?

273
00:25:23,963 --> 00:25:25,322
Okay. It's settled then.

274
00:25:25,402 --> 00:25:27,402
Now, let's talk about the interns' work.

275
00:25:27,548 --> 00:25:29,176
Both teams of interns have been doing well.

276
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,296
They've made great progress.

277
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,030
We are about to begin their internship assessment,

278
00:25:33,111 --> 00:25:34,642
so keep up the good work.

279
00:25:34,785 --> 00:25:37,298
What are your plans, mentor?

280
00:25:37,415 --> 00:25:38,936
Bei Er has been working diligently.

281
00:25:39,049 --> 00:25:40,156
I will continue to guide her

282
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,680
and help her secure a job here.

283
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:45,362
And you, Shu Yi?

284
00:25:45,609 --> 00:25:47,809
Shi Yue has already developed the basic writing skills.

285
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:51,039
Next, I plan to work with her on a special feature article for Yunchuang.

286
00:25:54,449 --> 00:25:55,537
No, thanks, Shu Yi.

287
00:25:55,618 --> 00:25:56,993
Thank you for valuing me so much,

288
00:25:57,074 --> 00:26:00,541
but the special feature on Mingyu Yunchuang is a crucial project.

289
00:26:00,622 --> 00:26:02,770
I've only made a little progress.

290
00:26:02,851 --> 00:26:04,922
I don't want to weigh you down.

291
00:26:05,203 --> 00:26:07,363
There is still so much I need to learn.

292
00:26:07,521 --> 00:26:10,791
However, I can assist you with some other tasks to lighten your load.

293
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,180
Professor Yu, you want to talk to me?

294
00:26:18,488 --> 00:26:21,529
It's the first time you've called me. I'm so happy.

295
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,242
Miss Qin, please stop sending someone to record my lecture.

296
00:26:26,945 --> 00:26:28,202
I...

297
00:26:30,864 --> 00:26:32,040
I'm sorry.

298
00:26:32,122 --> 00:26:34,402
I've been very busy lately, so...

299
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,971
The course you're taking is a foundational one.

300
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,504
If you don't have time,

301
00:26:40,636 --> 00:26:42,203
you can study at home.

302
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:44,904
(If you have any questions, come to school next time and ask me.)

303
00:26:44,928 --> 00:26:46,624
But please stop sending someone to film my class.

304
00:26:46,648 --> 00:26:48,237
It distracts my other students.

305
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,596
I understand. I won't do it again.

306
00:26:51,751 --> 00:26:53,413
I'll study at home by myself.

307
00:26:53,494 --> 00:26:55,544
I'll try my best to attend your lectures in person.

308
00:26:56,265 --> 00:26:57,482
Thank you.

309
00:27:05,585 --> 00:27:07,585
Yu You called me

310
00:27:07,777 --> 00:27:09,433
and even said I can ask him questions in person

311
00:27:09,457 --> 00:27:11,248
if I don't understand.

312
00:27:12,129 --> 00:27:14,931
Does this count as him inviting me to see him?

313
00:27:20,323 --> 00:27:22,362
(You treated me to noodles a few days ago.)

314
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,020
(It's my turn to treat you to dinner.)

315
00:27:24,842 --> 00:27:25,952
(Okay.)

316
00:27:28,803 --> 00:27:30,352
(I'll decide what to eat.)

317
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,760
(Okay.)

318
00:27:36,041 --> 00:27:37,791
(So, pick me up after work?)

319
00:27:39,259 --> 00:27:40,442
(Okay.)

320
00:27:44,416 --> 00:27:45,926
Are you just going to "okay" me?

321
00:27:46,594 --> 00:27:48,794
If you don't talk, no one can know what's on your mind.

322
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,482
(Are you in a bad mood now?)

323
00:27:53,785 --> 00:27:54,857
(Yes.)

324
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,600
(It's like that night, )

325
00:27:58,681 --> 00:28:01,041
(when you left, you seemed to be in a bad mood.)

326
00:28:01,274 --> 00:28:03,482
(But later, you went to buy noodles for me, )

327
00:28:03,578 --> 00:28:05,458
(and it seemed like you were in a better mood.)

328
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,420
(Don't you have other things to do?)

329
00:28:14,963 --> 00:28:18,162
(Whether you're happy or not is a top priority for me.)

330
00:28:31,656 --> 00:28:33,166
This article...

331
00:28:33,301 --> 00:28:34,801
What do you think?

332
00:28:36,827 --> 00:28:38,750
Is the criticism too strong?

333
00:28:39,122 --> 00:28:41,609
After all, they're our advertising client, Shi Yue.

334
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:43,117
I know.

335
00:28:43,198 --> 00:28:44,802
Before I wrote it,

336
00:28:44,883 --> 00:28:46,428
I double-checked all these facts.

337
00:28:47,715 --> 00:28:49,586
Please tone it down and make it more polished.

338
00:28:52,003 --> 00:28:53,282
Editor,

339
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,360
the media is the voice of the public

340
00:28:55,441 --> 00:28:56,719
and the conscience of society.

341
00:28:56,826 --> 00:28:59,136
Journalists cannot speak against their conscience.

342
00:28:59,401 --> 00:29:03,439
I can't and I won't write an overly exaggerated piece.

343
00:29:04,901 --> 00:29:06,994
It's really like mentor, like disciple.

344
00:29:07,136 --> 00:29:09,215
You're just like Zheng Shu Yi.

345
00:29:09,308 --> 00:29:11,429
Shu Yi taught me to be truthful and objective.

346
00:29:11,544 --> 00:29:13,099
Have an opinion and an attitude.

347
00:29:13,243 --> 00:29:15,683
We can't write based on how the interviewee wants it.

348
00:29:15,809 --> 00:29:17,049
Fine.

349
00:29:17,201 --> 00:29:18,922
Go and call Zheng Shu Yi here.

350
00:29:19,402 --> 00:29:22,342
I didn't expect this intern to be so insightful.

351
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,322
Some of it is what I taught her before,

352
00:29:25,451 --> 00:29:27,971
but I didn't expect her to actually apply it in her PR piece.

353
00:29:28,116 --> 00:29:29,852
Our editor asked her to go and make revisions,

354
00:29:29,876 --> 00:29:31,390
but she stood her ground,

355
00:29:31,471 --> 00:29:32,928
using the journalistic spirit I told her earlier.

356
00:29:32,952 --> 00:29:34,982
Now our editor is having an headache.

357
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:38,978
This intern of yours sounds really interesting.

358
00:29:40,925 --> 00:29:42,722
(Now you're praising her.)

359
00:29:42,842 --> 00:29:44,793
(I don't usually hear you praise me.)

360
00:29:47,803 --> 00:29:51,122
Yes, her taste and aesthetic are on point.

361
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:53,187
Lately, she's been very motivated.

362
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,416
She's been attending Professor Yu's lectures

363
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,000
at University of Finance and Economics.

364
00:29:57,793 --> 00:30:00,484
Getting a spot in Professor Yu's class is no easy feat.

365
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:02,287
She's determined

366
00:30:02,368 --> 00:30:04,442
and hasn't let anything stop her.

367
00:30:04,542 --> 00:30:06,922
I've attended a few of Professor Yu's classes in the past,

368
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:09,162
and they were so captivating.

369
00:30:09,312 --> 00:30:11,082
He's an excellent speaker.

370
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,242
If I had a charismatic and interesting finance lecturer

371
00:30:14,338 --> 00:30:16,775
like Professor Yu during my college years,

372
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:18,601
I would've definitely pursued finance.

373
00:30:18,954 --> 00:30:23,242
The world of financial journalism would have missed out on a rising star.

374
00:30:26,864 --> 00:30:28,053
Really?

375
00:30:31,545 --> 00:30:33,562
(Now he's getting jealous of Yu You.)

376
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:34,889
(Shan Shan was right.)

377
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:37,607
(Men like what they can't have and want to conquer.)

378
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,322
Absolutely.

379
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,878
When you think about it,

380
00:30:42,032 --> 00:30:43,994
Professor Yu is three years older than you.

381
00:30:44,353 --> 00:30:45,711
But I've seen him a few times.

382
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,643
He looks like he's younger than you

383
00:30:48,794 --> 00:30:50,504
and has a more cheerful personality.

384
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,989
I almost forgot,

385
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,823
Professor Yu was quite famous in Qing'an.

386
00:30:57,184 --> 00:30:58,849
I heard he skipped two grades in school.

387
00:30:58,938 --> 00:31:02,202
He was already in college when I was in middle school.

388
00:31:02,564 --> 00:31:03,942
Later, he went on to excel even more,

389
00:31:03,966 --> 00:31:06,202
graduated from Harvard on a full scholarship,

390
00:31:06,283 --> 00:31:08,079
obtained a dual degree from Cambridge,

391
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,560
and published numerous papers in the Science Citation Index.

392
00:31:10,666 --> 00:31:12,962
I also heard he's really into sports.

393
00:31:13,032 --> 00:31:15,754
Oh my, a genius professor who's young,

394
00:31:15,835 --> 00:31:17,672
handsome, and interesting like this,

395
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,882
what student wouldn't like him?

396
00:31:21,522 --> 00:31:22,762
Do you like him too?

397
00:31:24,152 --> 00:31:26,662
Come on, who wouldn't like someone like that?

398
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,359
Where are you going?

399
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,842
Weren't we supposed to have dinner?

400
00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:37,368
Since you enjoy classes so much,

401
00:31:37,449 --> 00:31:38,949
I'm going to give you extra lesson.

402
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,002
Extra lesson?

403
00:31:53,097 --> 00:31:56,242
Instead of having dinner, he is showing me these.

404
00:31:56,616 --> 00:31:58,418
What is he trying to do?

405
00:31:58,659 --> 00:32:00,136
I just thought

406
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,282
that you should broaden your horizons a bit

407
00:32:02,463 --> 00:32:04,808
and understand the universality of the human world.

408
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:06,575
Otherwise, you might mistakenly think

409
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:08,642
that some people and things are unique.

410
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:10,195
Where's the universality in this?

411
00:32:14,272 --> 00:32:17,672
(He's doing this because I praised Professor Yu.)

412
00:32:22,499 --> 00:32:24,400
You not only excel academically

413
00:32:24,504 --> 00:32:26,042
but also know so much.

414
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,721
You're truly outstanding. Now I feel inadequate.

415
00:32:32,224 --> 00:32:34,823
How do you manage to excel in your studies

416
00:32:34,904 --> 00:32:36,586
while having so many hobbies?

417
00:32:56,369 --> 00:32:58,842
2015, 2016,

418
00:32:59,008 --> 00:33:01,082
2017, 2018...

419
00:33:01,225 --> 00:33:02,854
Why isn't there 2019?

420
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,830
Why are there no more medals after that?

421
00:33:05,061 --> 00:33:08,139
In 2019, I left Mingyu and founded Yunchuang.

422
00:33:08,291 --> 00:33:11,171
Later, work became very busy. I didn't have time for running or fitness.

423
00:33:12,977 --> 00:33:17,162
So, why did you leave Mingyu at that time?

424
00:33:19,883 --> 00:33:21,097
I'm just curious.

425
00:33:21,194 --> 00:33:23,034
You don't have to answer if you don't want to.

426
00:33:35,914 --> 00:33:38,652
During my postgraduate studies, I was very interested in investment.

427
00:33:39,034 --> 00:33:40,242
After graduating,

428
00:33:40,338 --> 00:33:42,568
I wanted to work in a related field.

429
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:44,070
However, after graduation,

430
00:33:44,151 --> 00:33:46,868
I ended up joining Mingyu as per my father's expectations.

431
00:33:47,406 --> 00:33:49,446
By that time, Mingyu had already grown quite large,

432
00:33:49,523 --> 00:33:50,723
and it had many employees.

433
00:33:50,808 --> 00:33:52,384
Many of the children of long-time employees

434
00:33:52,408 --> 00:33:54,048
also joined Mingyu after they graduated.

435
00:33:54,608 --> 00:33:55,929
To outsiders,

436
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:58,079
Mingyu looked like a massive carrier.

437
00:33:58,255 --> 00:33:59,574
However, its management

438
00:33:59,702 --> 00:34:02,089
lacked modern and scientific practices.

439
00:34:02,594 --> 00:34:05,394
A company overly reliant on scale and capital

440
00:34:05,685 --> 00:34:07,282
could lack flexibility

441
00:34:07,406 --> 00:34:09,396
and fail to keep up with the times.

442
00:34:09,886 --> 00:34:11,886
I noticed this issue back then

443
00:34:11,996 --> 00:34:13,667
and made several suggestions.

444
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:15,522
However,

445
00:34:16,481 --> 00:34:17,974
Mingyu was the result of a lifetime

446
00:34:18,055 --> 00:34:19,975
of hard work by my father and his close friends.

447
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:23,085
It's difficult to make significant changes to things like that.

448
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:26,113
If we wanted to preserve my family's legacy,

449
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:28,282
my brother-in-law was a better fit.

450
00:34:28,874 --> 00:34:31,985
That's why you handed it over to your brother-in-law?

451
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:36,319
I didn't hand it over.

452
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,456
My brother-in-law also put a lot of effort into Mingyu.

453
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,980
He rightfully deserved it.

454
00:34:41,006 --> 00:34:43,117
Besides, I had my own aspirations.

455
00:34:43,398 --> 00:34:47,142
I wanted to help entrepreneurs who wanted to make society better.

456
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,830
I wanted to explore more possibilities.

457
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:56,430
Shi Yan, I think you're very brave.

458
00:34:57,021 --> 00:34:58,821
It takes a lot of courage

459
00:34:58,902 --> 00:35:01,442
to break away from the established framework

460
00:35:01,553 --> 00:35:03,061
and pursue your own dreams and visions.

461
00:35:03,085 --> 00:35:06,602
Especially considering what you gave up, which many people would envy.

462
00:35:06,782 --> 00:35:07,941
Throughout this process,

463
00:35:08,045 --> 00:35:09,286
you had to withstand pressure,

464
00:35:09,366 --> 00:35:10,766
endure people's criticism,

465
00:35:10,846 --> 00:35:11,873
and quietly work hard.

466
00:35:11,958 --> 00:35:13,159
But you did it,

467
00:35:13,248 --> 00:35:15,084
and you did it very well.

468
00:35:21,315 --> 00:35:22,815
You really think so?

469
00:35:31,054 --> 00:35:32,554
Do I have a reward then?

470
00:36:56,921 --> 00:36:57,926
Hello.

471
00:36:58,015 --> 00:37:00,522
(Mr. Shi, your business trip has been arranged.)

472
00:37:03,173 --> 00:37:06,274
From now on, there's no need to call me for such trivial matters.

473
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:09,442
(Zheng Shu Yi, what were you doing?)

474
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,402
(Why did you...)

475
00:37:25,193 --> 00:37:26,693
I'm going on

476
00:37:27,701 --> 00:37:29,211
a business trip in a couple of days.

477
00:37:30,152 --> 00:37:32,722
Will you come with me?

478
00:37:37,087 --> 00:37:40,396
I'll need to check my schedule when I get back.

479
00:37:40,796 --> 00:37:43,282
I might have a business trip too.

480
00:37:47,608 --> 00:37:49,962
I'll go back and check on it right away.

481
00:38:11,987 --> 00:38:14,722
(Attention passengers traveling to Ancheng, )

482
00:38:14,885 --> 00:38:18,522
(the flight will begin boarding in ten minutes.)

483
00:38:18,743 --> 00:38:21,105
(Please proceed to gate 23.)

484
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,922
You may leave.

485
00:38:44,758 --> 00:38:47,362
Mr. Fan is already in Ancheng. I've asked him to pick you up.

486
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,772
Mr. Shi, what a coincidence.

487
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,532
What are the odds.

488
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,322
I'm going to Ancheng on business too.

489
00:39:39,385 --> 00:39:40,602
What's wrong?

490
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,402
Nothing.

491
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,282
- Hello. - (Why haven't you been answering my calls?)

492
00:39:57,208 --> 00:39:58,222
I'm on a business trip.

493
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,980
(So sudden? Does Shi Yan know about it?)

494
00:40:02,486 --> 00:40:03,986
It's with him.

495
00:40:05,382 --> 00:40:06,882
With Shi Yan?

496
00:40:07,992 --> 00:40:10,432
(Yi, good for you.)

497
00:40:10,592 --> 00:40:13,192
But listen, no matter how much fun you have,

498
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:16,084
you'd better not go as two and return as three.

499
00:40:16,432 --> 00:40:17,943
I got it. I have to go.

500
00:40:31,445 --> 00:40:32,562
Hello.

501
00:40:32,999 --> 00:40:34,919
Hi, Shi Yan. Have you landed?

502
00:40:35,024 --> 00:40:37,704
I've sent the information about other battery companies to your email.

503
00:40:37,728 --> 00:40:40,322
If you need any additional details, just let me know.

504
00:40:41,226 --> 00:40:42,500
Got it.

505
00:40:42,637 --> 00:40:44,507
I'm on a business trip with Miss Zheng.

506
00:40:44,616 --> 00:40:46,606
She's sitting right next to me.

507
00:40:53,672 --> 00:40:55,402
Who were you talking to?

508
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:59,042
It's that excellent Professor Yu you mentioned.

509
00:41:08,345 --> 00:41:11,736
(You mustn't let him have it too easy.)

510
00:41:11,889 --> 00:41:13,148
(I got it.)

511
00:41:20,546 --> 00:41:22,810
Miss Zheng, you seem to excel at multitasking.

512
00:41:22,891 --> 00:41:24,266
You're on a business trip with me

513
00:41:24,363 --> 00:41:26,713
and chatting with Professor Yu at the same time.

514
00:41:28,313 --> 00:41:29,882
Well, Mr. Shi, aren't you also looking at Zhanlan

515
00:41:29,906 --> 00:41:31,785
and thinking about other battery companies?

516
00:41:31,888 --> 00:41:33,838
We're quite the perfect pair, aren't we?

517
00:41:43,697 --> 00:41:45,842
Mr. Shi, the hotel is just up ahead.

518
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,602
Mr. Fan, please take me to Kanglan Hotel.

519
00:42:10,472 --> 00:42:11,552
Get off.

520
00:42:23,662 --> 00:42:25,162
What are you doing?

521
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,639
I'm taking a cab to my hotel.

522
00:42:28,113 --> 00:42:29,561
This is your hotel.

523
00:42:29,649 --> 00:42:32,162
Zhanlan is nearby, so I booked a room here.

524
00:42:32,242 --> 00:42:34,016
You also need to go to Zhanlan and do some follow-up interviews,

525
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,540
so you're staying here with me.

526
00:42:36,329 --> 00:42:37,643
Staying with you?

527
00:42:38,978 --> 00:42:40,202
What's wrong?

528
00:42:40,322 --> 00:42:41,675
Don't you want to?
