1
00:01:30,842 --> 00:01:36,073
(Only For Love)

2
00:01:36,154 --> 00:01:39,002
(Episode 31)

3
00:01:53,802 --> 00:01:56,081
(This plate of fish is Shu Yi.)

4
00:01:56,162 --> 00:01:58,762
(Uncle, she's drinking the fish soup.)

5
00:01:58,962 --> 00:02:02,002
(Uncle. Do you want to keep your girlfriend or not?)

6
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,889
(Someone else is going to eat all of the bamboo shoots.)

7
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:06,842
(Uncle, have you read my messages or not?)

8
00:02:07,645 --> 00:02:09,564
(He's so attentive and considerate.)

9
00:02:09,645 --> 00:02:11,436
(Most importantly, he's very proactive.)

10
00:03:31,351 --> 00:03:33,202
It seems like I have a fever.

11
00:05:08,213 --> 00:05:09,393
Zheng Shu Yi.

12
00:05:30,988 --> 00:05:32,088
Zheng Shu Yi.

13
00:06:51,685 --> 00:06:52,785
Where are you going?

14
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:56,930
To the hospital. I'm sick.

15
00:07:02,487 --> 00:07:03,739
Get in the car.

16
00:07:25,965 --> 00:07:29,018
(Why did he appear down here at my house?)

17
00:07:29,487 --> 00:07:31,642
(Was he here to see me, )

18
00:07:32,883 --> 00:07:36,362
(or was it a coincidence?)

19
00:07:39,722 --> 00:07:41,312
(But now, )

20
00:07:41,893 --> 00:07:44,262
(I don't seem to have the right to ask this question.)

21
00:08:38,996 --> 00:08:42,462
Miss, the doctor said I just have a cold and fever.

22
00:08:42,568 --> 00:08:44,042
Can I get a finger poke?

23
00:08:44,172 --> 00:08:45,442
What do you think?

24
00:08:46,661 --> 00:08:47,842
Tighten your fist.

25
00:09:24,509 --> 00:09:25,569
Okay, hold it.

26
00:09:34,828 --> 00:09:37,859
Why is someone so old still crying over a blood test?

27
00:10:00,334 --> 00:10:01,842
What were you crying about?

28
00:10:02,337 --> 00:10:03,597
I wasn't crying.

29
00:10:04,255 --> 00:10:05,555
I was just...

30
00:10:08,218 --> 00:10:09,728
(I was just thinking)

31
00:10:09,891 --> 00:10:12,442
(if nothing had happened on the fourth day of the Lunar New Year, )

32
00:10:12,563 --> 00:10:15,148
(we should be together watching the stars now.)

33
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:19,593
I didn't expect to be in the hospital at this time.

34
00:10:20,429 --> 00:10:21,429
Yeah.

35
00:10:21,803 --> 00:10:23,872
Otherwise, you should be at my house at this time.

36
00:10:24,883 --> 00:10:26,242
(Did I hear wrong?)

37
00:10:26,443 --> 00:10:29,152
(How could I have misheard such a simple sentence?)

38
00:10:29,544 --> 00:10:33,126
(No. Why did he suddenly say that?)

39
00:10:35,354 --> 00:10:36,442
I...

40
00:10:36,532 --> 00:10:37,795
Did I say something wrong?

41
00:10:44,628 --> 00:10:45,888
You said it right.

42
00:10:49,443 --> 00:10:50,723
(Zheng Shu Yi, )

43
00:10:50,803 --> 00:10:53,152
(please go to the laboratory to get your test results.)

44
00:11:22,665 --> 00:11:24,856
The scenery today seems even more beautiful.

45
00:11:26,204 --> 00:11:27,264
It's very beautiful.

46
00:11:29,741 --> 00:11:31,386
This place has a lot of meaning.

47
00:11:31,523 --> 00:11:34,073
So, I want to come here again with you today.

48
00:11:35,373 --> 00:11:37,003
I like it here too.

49
00:11:47,323 --> 00:11:49,353
What's wrong with this man?

50
00:11:50,308 --> 00:11:51,682
It's been so long

51
00:11:51,951 --> 00:11:53,301
without any response.

52
00:11:53,382 --> 00:11:54,522
Not even a sign.

53
00:11:54,603 --> 00:11:55,603
Yue.

54
00:11:55,884 --> 00:11:57,202
Actually, I...

55
00:11:58,074 --> 00:12:01,811
Do you want to know what gift I got for you?

56
00:12:02,737 --> 00:12:04,172
You prepared a gift for me?

57
00:12:04,253 --> 00:12:05,482
What is it?

58
00:12:15,515 --> 00:12:17,602
These are books for the postgraduate exam.

59
00:12:17,693 --> 00:12:18,722
Not really suitable for you.

60
00:12:18,869 --> 00:12:20,354
I have many books that are suitable for you.

61
00:12:20,435 --> 00:12:21,682
I'll bring them to you later.

62
00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:25,730
Why are you so silly?

63
00:12:27,403 --> 00:12:29,042
I am preparing to pursue a Master's degree

64
00:12:29,122 --> 00:12:30,723
at the University of Finance and Economics.

65
00:12:31,323 --> 00:12:34,112
I don't know if my boyfriend has time to tutor me.

66
00:12:34,602 --> 00:12:35,602
Really?

67
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:37,578
Of course I have time.

68
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,312
So, do you have a gift prepared for me?

69
00:12:55,044 --> 00:12:56,595
Why did you give me this?

70
00:12:59,373 --> 00:13:01,642
Because there's a "You" in my name.

71
00:13:02,046 --> 00:13:06,206
I used to be like a boat, drifting around.

72
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,489
Until I met you,

73
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:12,002
my heart found calmness,

74
00:13:12,221 --> 00:13:13,971
and I felt a desire to stop.

75
00:13:18,284 --> 00:13:20,562
That's like dropping anchor, right?

76
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:23,001
So, you can't go any further.

77
00:13:26,905 --> 00:13:28,082
Just kidding.

78
00:13:28,188 --> 00:13:29,327
Help me put it on.

79
00:13:41,283 --> 00:13:42,362
Do I look good?

80
00:13:43,798 --> 00:13:45,042
You look great.

81
00:14:06,508 --> 00:14:08,922
This is something I owe my girlfriend.

82
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:32,585
Your white blood cell count is a bit high.

83
00:14:32,737 --> 00:14:34,098
But it's not a serious problem.

84
00:14:34,203 --> 00:14:35,492
I'll give you some medicine.

85
00:14:35,573 --> 00:14:36,882
Go back and take it on time.

86
00:14:36,968 --> 00:14:39,283
If you still have a fever tomorrow morning,

87
00:14:39,442 --> 00:14:40,742
come back to the hospital for an IV.

88
00:14:40,828 --> 00:14:42,162
- Remember to rest well.   - Okay.

89
00:14:42,243 --> 00:14:43,362
You can leave now.

90
00:15:35,188 --> 00:15:36,287
Are you mute?

91
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:41,913
Never mind.

92
00:16:10,877 --> 00:16:13,107
(Shi Yan, do you have time tomorrow?)

93
00:16:19,507 --> 00:16:20,507
(What?)

94
00:16:21,453 --> 00:16:22,762
It's something good for sure.

95
00:16:22,904 --> 00:16:24,985
I found a few experts in chip technology.

96
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:26,443
They gave me some ideas.

97
00:16:26,523 --> 00:16:27,562
(Tomorrow is a holiday.)

98
00:16:27,643 --> 00:16:29,983
(So, I want to meet up with you and explain it to you.)

99
00:16:46,691 --> 00:16:49,162
(Shi Yan, will you come out tomorrow to keep me company?)

100
00:16:49,292 --> 00:16:51,282
(Otherwise, I'll go to your place.)

101
00:16:52,802 --> 00:16:53,943
You're so free.

102
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:56,280
I'm just joking.

103
00:16:56,523 --> 00:16:59,924
(Shi Yan, will you come to eat with me tomorrow?)

104
00:17:03,676 --> 00:17:06,186
Didn't you just say it was about work?

105
00:17:17,633 --> 00:17:18,842
You're awake.

106
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,569
Will you go tomorrow?

107
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,082
You heard it?

108
00:17:31,193 --> 00:17:32,624
I heard a little bit.

109
00:17:34,076 --> 00:17:35,586
You're even controlling this?

110
00:17:37,394 --> 00:17:39,114
I'm not controlling.

111
00:17:39,244 --> 00:17:40,635
I'm just asking.

112
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,122
So, do you want me to go?

113
00:17:59,563 --> 00:18:01,192
Of course I don't want you to go.

114
00:18:02,043 --> 00:18:03,063
Zheng Shu Yi.

115
00:18:04,724 --> 00:18:08,675
What role are you speaking from right now?

116
00:18:25,642 --> 00:18:28,243
Because the calendar said it's not suitable to travel tomorrow.

117
00:18:28,371 --> 00:18:30,081
There will be a great crisis.

118
00:18:39,043 --> 00:18:40,242
Go back to sleep.

119
00:18:48,803 --> 00:18:51,594
I meant it. Be careful tomorrow.

120
00:19:19,923 --> 00:19:22,162
- Hello.   - (Hello, Shu Yi.)

121
00:19:22,243 --> 00:19:23,762
(Are you busy now?)

122
00:19:24,003 --> 00:19:25,202
I'm not busy.

123
00:19:25,892 --> 00:19:27,251
I'm almost done resting.

124
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,721
I want to go back to work.

125
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,082
Did your uncle agree?

126
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,122
I haven't asked him yet.

127
00:19:34,253 --> 00:19:36,442
He's been busy lately and doesn't have time to take care of me.

128
00:19:38,442 --> 00:19:41,162
(Shall we go out for dinner together after you finish work?)

129
00:19:42,162 --> 00:19:43,842
Not today. I'm sick.

130
00:19:43,939 --> 00:19:45,209
You're sick?

131
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:47,289
Are you okay? Is it serious?

132
00:19:47,459 --> 00:19:49,489
It's nothing, just a bit of fever.

133
00:19:49,933 --> 00:19:51,602
(Have you seen a doctor?)

134
00:19:52,436 --> 00:19:53,802
I'm getting an IV at the hospital.

135
00:19:53,897 --> 00:19:55,722
How can it be considered not serious if you need to get an IV?

136
00:19:55,854 --> 00:19:57,285
Is anyone with you?

137
00:19:58,027 --> 00:19:59,995
It's nothing. It's just a minor illness.

138
00:20:01,682 --> 00:20:03,608
I'm calling the nurse. I'm hanging up first.

139
00:20:03,712 --> 00:20:06,022
Okay, take care of yourself.

140
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,489
Speak your mind.

141
00:20:44,893 --> 00:20:47,389
Shu Yi is sick. She's very ill. She's all alone.

142
00:20:47,485 --> 00:20:50,058
No one to take care of her. It's pitiful she's getting an IV.

143
00:21:07,012 --> 00:21:08,012
I'm done.

144
00:22:16,222 --> 00:22:17,442
Don't move.

145
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:24,122
You're here alone to get an IV and still have the nerve to sleep.

146
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,689
You are really mindless.

147
00:22:27,933 --> 00:22:29,243
Why did you come here?

148
00:22:29,914 --> 00:22:31,354
I told you to stay at home.

149
00:22:31,435 --> 00:22:33,385
Aren't you the greatest crisis in my destiny?

150
00:22:45,483 --> 00:22:47,037
You came to the hospital to torture the singles.

151
00:22:47,118 --> 00:22:48,418
Is there still any humanity?

152
00:22:51,362 --> 00:22:53,472
Was it because I spoke too loudly?

153
00:22:54,477 --> 00:22:57,202
Sorry about that. You guys keep going.

154
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:06,122
Are you leaving?

155
00:23:13,539 --> 00:23:14,969
Thank you for your clothes.

156
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,930
(Don't take it.)

157
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:22,562
(Let me keep wearing it.)

158
00:23:33,802 --> 00:23:35,352
Are you planning to stay here?

159
00:23:37,404 --> 00:23:40,402
I'm too dizzy to walk.

160
00:23:41,308 --> 00:23:42,562
Here you go again.

161
00:24:33,587 --> 00:24:34,882
Zheng Shu Yi.

162
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,731
Are you that confident that I would fall for you?

163
00:24:39,349 --> 00:24:41,549
Don't call me by my full name.

164
00:24:41,661 --> 00:24:43,402
It sounds so scary.

165
00:24:43,619 --> 00:24:46,042
Zheng Shu Yi, don't change the topic.

166
00:24:46,483 --> 00:24:47,882
I didn't mean it that way.

167
00:24:48,067 --> 00:24:49,442
I dare not.

168
00:24:49,925 --> 00:24:51,594
I'm just a bit weak.

169
00:24:52,326 --> 00:24:53,602
Keep acting.

170
00:24:54,267 --> 00:24:55,577
I'm not acting.

171
00:24:56,571 --> 00:24:57,830
Actually,

172
00:24:58,106 --> 00:25:00,217
I'm not lying to you all the time.

173
00:25:05,598 --> 00:25:08,202
For a long period of time when I knew you,

174
00:25:08,442 --> 00:25:10,233
I was indeed acting.

175
00:25:10,555 --> 00:25:11,842
But later,

176
00:25:11,954 --> 00:25:14,362
it all seemed to become a habit.

177
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:16,897
Whenever I see you, I will act like that.

178
00:25:19,579 --> 00:25:24,122
I don't know when these changes started,

179
00:25:24,405 --> 00:25:26,362
or if it still counts as acting.

180
00:25:26,572 --> 00:25:28,252
I don't even know

181
00:25:28,403 --> 00:25:31,602
when I started to mean it instead of just pretending.

182
00:25:31,755 --> 00:25:33,265
I also don't know

183
00:25:33,346 --> 00:25:36,056
when I started to like you.

184
00:25:38,156 --> 00:25:39,291
Shi Yan,

185
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:42,402
I caused our beginning to be imperfect.

186
00:25:43,652 --> 00:25:45,401
But, I really like you.

187
00:25:47,404 --> 00:25:49,265
I want to have a perfect ending with you.

188
00:25:56,659 --> 00:25:57,802
Oh.

189
00:25:59,851 --> 00:26:01,602
What does that mean?

190
00:26:02,563 --> 00:26:04,802
Do you believe it or not? Say something.

191
00:26:04,883 --> 00:26:06,234
What does that mean?

192
00:26:19,881 --> 00:26:21,512
It all depends on your performance.

193
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:43,122
I don't know how to perform.

194
00:26:43,658 --> 00:26:45,722
Why don't you tell me some important points?

195
00:26:51,477 --> 00:26:53,477
Do you want me to take a "naked exam" (closed-book exam)?

196
00:26:56,142 --> 00:26:57,402
"Naked exam"?

197
00:26:58,745 --> 00:27:00,722
How would you like to take a "naked exam"?

198
00:27:03,174 --> 00:27:05,170
It's fine if you don't want to tell me. Don't make inappropriate jokes.

199
00:27:05,251 --> 00:27:06,682
That's not what I mean.

200
00:27:14,043 --> 00:27:15,222
Zheng Shu Yi.

201
00:27:22,924 --> 00:27:25,314
- What again?   - Have you forgotten something?

202
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,122
What have I forgotten?

203
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,442
Think about it.

204
00:27:33,691 --> 00:27:36,640
I forgot to thank you for sending me home.

205
00:27:51,162 --> 00:27:53,042
I know it's raining. But I'm waiting for my boyfriend.

206
00:27:53,122 --> 00:27:54,362
Yes, I already have a boyfriend.

207
00:27:54,443 --> 00:27:55,743
Take care. Thank you.

208
00:28:15,212 --> 00:28:16,512
What are you thinking about?

209
00:28:17,391 --> 00:28:18,570
Nothing.

210
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:20,880
Just thinking about the first time we met.

211
00:28:20,963 --> 00:28:22,922
I refused your offer to take me home.

212
00:28:23,092 --> 00:28:25,402
I felt like I had missed out on the whole world.

213
00:28:26,892 --> 00:28:29,162
Who told you that was our first time meeting?

214
00:28:33,864 --> 00:28:37,042
Was it a long, long time ago?

215
00:28:37,603 --> 00:28:39,722
Could it be when I was in college?

216
00:28:41,188 --> 00:28:42,522
It couldn't have been earlier than that.

217
00:28:42,603 --> 00:28:44,554
I only came to Jiangcheng when I was in college.

218
00:28:47,543 --> 00:28:49,643
- What for?   - Go home.

219
00:28:52,828 --> 00:28:55,242
Tell me. I can't remember.

220
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:01,114
If you can't remember, don't think about it.

221
00:29:12,362 --> 00:29:14,872
(Shu Yi, are you feeling better?)

222
00:29:17,865 --> 00:29:20,174
(I'm fine. Thank you for today.)

223
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,322
(Thank me for what?)

224
00:29:26,122 --> 00:29:29,553
(Nothing. Just thank you for your concern.)

225
00:29:30,067 --> 00:29:31,656
(You're too polite.)

226
00:29:31,922 --> 00:29:33,632
(So, you're going back to work?)

227
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:37,642
(Yes. I have nothing to do at home.)

228
00:29:37,733 --> 00:29:39,243
(I'll go to work tomorrow.)

229
00:29:43,223 --> 00:29:48,593
Was Shi Yan talking about the matter regarding my deletion of him?

230
00:29:50,484 --> 00:29:52,922
No, definitely not.

231
00:29:53,642 --> 00:29:56,912
He has to send me a message to find out.

232
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,082
And if he did find out,

233
00:29:59,402 --> 00:30:02,313
how could he be so calm and mention it to me?

234
00:30:18,003 --> 00:30:20,871
(Yue, give me your uncle's WeChat.)

235
00:30:23,643 --> 00:30:25,314
(Don't you have it?)

236
00:30:29,197 --> 00:30:31,322
(I accidentally deleted it.)

237
00:30:32,858 --> 00:30:35,178
(Shu Yi, I'm not a three-year-old kid anymore.)

238
00:30:35,259 --> 00:30:36,602
(I won't believe such a thing.)

239
00:30:36,851 --> 00:30:39,803
(How much would you have to drink for you to accidentally delete someone?)

240
00:30:42,237 --> 00:30:43,842
(Don't ask.)

241
00:30:44,203 --> 00:30:47,002
(Shi Yan.)

242
00:30:59,101 --> 00:31:00,242
(Too free?)

243
00:31:03,124 --> 00:31:04,362
(I'm not free.)

244
00:31:04,601 --> 00:31:06,442
(I'm seriously thinking about something)

245
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:07,682
(I want to ask you.)

246
00:31:09,245 --> 00:31:10,282
(Speak.)

247
00:31:11,763 --> 00:31:15,162
(What is your ideal girlfriend like?)

248
00:31:19,547 --> 00:31:20,647
(Quiet, )

249
00:31:21,219 --> 00:31:22,402
(respectable, )

250
00:31:22,763 --> 00:31:23,982
(serious.)

251
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,341
(Zheng Shu Yi, a journalist at Financial Introduce, )

252
00:31:30,444 --> 00:31:32,443
(has a quiet personality, a respectable job)

253
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:33,723
(and dedicated to serious writing.)

254
00:31:33,882 --> 00:31:36,593
(I think I'm your ideal girlfriend.)

255
00:31:45,323 --> 00:31:46,522
(Is that so?)

256
00:32:04,083 --> 00:32:06,273
Did I use to talk like this?

257
00:32:08,602 --> 00:32:12,042
Cheesy pick-up lines on the internet can be problematic.

258
00:32:17,162 --> 00:32:18,857
(Stop it. Don't send it anymore.)

259
00:32:18,938 --> 00:32:19,938
(Unsubscribing now.)

260
00:32:23,586 --> 00:32:25,916
(If you keep sending these, you'll see a news)

261
00:32:25,997 --> 00:32:28,362
(of a young beautiful girl falling to her death.)

262
00:32:33,323 --> 00:32:34,927
(Don't you want to see how you were being)

263
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:37,522
(a quiet, respectable, and serious person?)

264
00:32:41,483 --> 00:32:43,993
We can't talk about this anymore.

265
00:32:53,323 --> 00:32:54,833
What is Mr. Shi thinking?

266
00:32:54,963 --> 00:32:56,672
The company won't go bankrupt, right?

267
00:32:56,763 --> 00:32:58,402
Then, I have to hurry and update my resume.

268
00:32:58,483 --> 00:33:00,122
What's the situation now?

269
00:33:08,523 --> 00:33:09,599
Shi Yan.

270
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,602
Listen to my advice.

271
00:33:11,963 --> 00:33:13,712
Let's withdraw from Le'an.

272
00:33:15,051 --> 00:33:16,920
If you insist on going on like this,

273
00:33:17,003 --> 00:33:18,912
it will not only hurt people's hearts

274
00:33:19,013 --> 00:33:21,243
but also shake the foundations of Yunchuang.

275
00:33:26,682 --> 00:33:27,682
Uncle Tian.

276
00:33:28,003 --> 00:33:30,482
It is indeed Le'an's most difficult time.

277
00:33:30,665 --> 00:33:31,755
But, it's not a dead end.

278
00:33:31,842 --> 00:33:34,396
As a partner, it's not very considerate to withdraw in the middle.

279
00:33:34,482 --> 00:33:35,502
As an investor,

280
00:33:35,583 --> 00:33:39,121
it's not the best choice to exit with a loss now.

281
00:33:39,922 --> 00:33:40,922
Shi Yan.

282
00:33:41,154 --> 00:33:43,762
Are you saying we are neither righteous nor wise?

283
00:33:43,947 --> 00:33:44,986
Definitely not.

284
00:33:45,098 --> 00:33:47,218
I understand the thoughts of both of you.

285
00:33:47,299 --> 00:33:49,459
I don't need your understanding.

286
00:33:49,562 --> 00:33:51,208
Anyway, I never believe in doing something

287
00:33:51,289 --> 00:33:53,002
that is doomed to fail.

288
00:33:53,091 --> 00:33:55,260
You can't let me pay for a decision I know is wrong.

289
00:33:55,341 --> 00:33:58,221
I won't do that.

290
00:34:00,437 --> 00:34:01,882
How about this then?

291
00:34:02,011 --> 00:34:03,891
No matter what the outcome is,

292
00:34:04,003 --> 00:34:05,602
I will still pay you and Uncle Zhang

293
00:34:05,683 --> 00:34:08,283
according to the estimated return rate in the investment report.

294
00:34:09,722 --> 00:34:11,753
Shi Yan, you're not young anymore.

295
00:34:12,602 --> 00:34:13,922
I'll call you Mr. Shi.

296
00:34:14,242 --> 00:34:18,002
Mr. Shi, we can't be reckless when we do things.

297
00:34:18,107 --> 00:34:19,788
You can't wait until there's a problem

298
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,802
and let your father settle for you.

299
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:22,990
Anyway,

300
00:34:23,226 --> 00:34:24,307
Mr. Zhang and I

301
00:34:24,403 --> 00:34:26,922
are not only concerned about money.

302
00:34:32,963 --> 00:34:35,313
Thank you, Mr. Tian and Mr. Zhang, for your understanding.

303
00:34:35,722 --> 00:34:38,592
Chen Kang and I will solve this matter as soon as possible.

304
00:35:00,365 --> 00:35:01,962
You're back.

305
00:35:02,957 --> 00:35:04,683
Let me see whether you look exhausted.

306
00:35:06,781 --> 00:35:09,602
Why are you even more energetic now after a serious illness?

307
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,322
You look even more beautiful.

308
00:35:11,662 --> 00:35:13,962
Someone must have worked a miracle.

309
00:35:22,843 --> 00:35:23,843
Shu Yi.

310
00:35:27,323 --> 00:35:28,323
Yi Yang.

311
00:35:28,948 --> 00:35:30,562
I heard you were sick the past two days.

312
00:35:30,836 --> 00:35:32,306
You're fine now, right?

313
00:35:33,909 --> 00:35:35,699
You look radiant now.

314
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:37,348
You look even better than before.

315
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:41,790
Yi Yang, I have something to tell you.

316
00:35:44,296 --> 00:35:46,677
Would I have the pleasure of inviting this lovely journalist

317
00:35:46,758 --> 00:35:48,624
to join me for dinner to discuss it further?

318
00:35:52,421 --> 00:35:53,421
Sure.

319
00:36:08,602 --> 00:36:09,992
Is there something on my face?

320
00:36:11,413 --> 00:36:13,362
I feel like something is different about you.

321
00:36:14,148 --> 00:36:17,769
I felt that you shut yourself off for a while.

322
00:36:18,036 --> 00:36:19,282
You appeared gloomy every day,

323
00:36:19,363 --> 00:36:20,722
like it was about to rain.

324
00:36:21,595 --> 00:36:22,616
But now,

325
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,091
it's like the rain has passed and the sun is out.

326
00:36:26,067 --> 00:36:27,402
Is it because of Shi Yan?

327
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:31,668
We're getting back soon.

328
00:36:31,749 --> 00:36:32,802
Getting back?

329
00:36:36,796 --> 00:36:40,465
A successful and experienced man like Shi Yan

330
00:36:40,614 --> 00:36:42,364
is always cautious and calm.

331
00:36:43,364 --> 00:36:44,922
After suffering such a loss,

332
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,545
how could he forgive so easily?

333
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,314
(Yeah.)

334
00:36:49,395 --> 00:36:51,232
(A man like Shi Yan would definitely not forgive)

335
00:36:51,313 --> 00:36:53,063
(someone's deception so easily.)

336
00:36:53,523 --> 00:36:55,642
(But, he did forgive me)

337
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,562
(and kept indulging me.)

338
00:37:00,435 --> 00:37:01,602
Shu Yi,

339
00:37:01,923 --> 00:37:03,362
I won't give up on you.

340
00:37:03,563 --> 00:37:06,115
I'll beat Shi Yan in business and in love.

341
00:37:06,646 --> 00:37:07,802
Just wait and see.

342
00:37:11,123 --> 00:37:13,074
I came here today to tell you

343
00:37:13,796 --> 00:37:15,962
that no matter if I get back with Shi Yan or not,

344
00:37:16,123 --> 00:37:17,602
there's no chance between us.

345
00:37:18,138 --> 00:37:19,448
Even if you don't give up,

346
00:37:19,553 --> 00:37:21,183
I won't change my mind.

347
00:37:21,947 --> 00:37:25,046
We never love someone just because they are good.

348
00:37:25,507 --> 00:37:27,642
Loving someone doesn't need a comparison.

349
00:37:27,843 --> 00:37:29,854
We will think the person is the best no matter what.

350
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,343
I feel the same way about you.

351
00:37:33,461 --> 00:37:34,602
Zheng Shu Yi.

352
00:37:34,754 --> 00:37:36,202
Liking you is my own business.

353
00:37:36,357 --> 00:37:38,416
Don't feel burdened by my feelings for you.

354
00:37:39,011 --> 00:37:41,880
If you don't feel ready to accept me yet,

355
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:44,807
I still hope we can still have the chance

356
00:37:45,082 --> 00:37:46,912
to meet, have meals,

357
00:37:47,861 --> 00:37:49,850
and try out interesting things together.

358
00:37:52,642 --> 00:37:55,833
No, I'm afraid my boyfriend will mind.

359
00:38:01,171 --> 00:38:02,731
Xing Zhou, what's going on with you lately?

360
00:38:02,859 --> 00:38:04,689
The clients have complained to me.

361
00:38:05,202 --> 00:38:07,552
You should hurry and go apologize in person.

362
00:38:08,372 --> 00:38:09,372
Yes.

363
00:38:22,483 --> 00:38:24,202
- Hey, Le Zhi.   - (Xing Zhou.)

364
00:38:24,282 --> 00:38:25,602
(I've talked to the HR Department.)

365
00:38:25,732 --> 00:38:27,793
(You can come for an interview at Yunchuang in two days.)

366
00:38:28,002 --> 00:38:29,721
- Really?   - (You should prepare well.)

367
00:38:29,802 --> 00:38:31,062
(There shouldn't be any problems.)

368
00:38:31,523 --> 00:38:33,223
Don't worry. I will definitely prepare well.

369
00:38:34,074 --> 00:38:35,704
Le Zhi, thank you.

370
00:38:35,887 --> 00:38:38,642
(Xing Zhou, I'm being so nice to you.)

371
00:38:38,843 --> 00:38:41,122
(You must treat me well in the future.)

372
00:38:41,376 --> 00:38:44,727
Le Zhi, I will definitely treat you well for the rest of my life.

373
00:38:51,853 --> 00:38:53,900
How long has it been since we had a drink together?

374
00:38:54,855 --> 00:38:56,002
It's been quite a while.

375
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,260
Yeah.

376
00:38:58,052 --> 00:39:00,642
It's always been you and me drinking on our own.

377
00:39:01,803 --> 00:39:03,002
You're more carefree than me.

378
00:39:03,083 --> 00:39:04,432
I still have to work during the day.

379
00:39:15,125 --> 00:39:16,442
When you were young,

380
00:39:16,586 --> 00:39:18,122
I separated with your mom

381
00:39:18,475 --> 00:39:20,042
and I've been busy with work ever since.

382
00:39:20,523 --> 00:39:22,032
I didn't show enough care for you.

383
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,701
Then, I put the responsibility on you

384
00:39:24,782 --> 00:39:26,242
and you got busy again.

385
00:39:27,003 --> 00:39:28,512
We, as parents,

386
00:39:30,563 --> 00:39:32,758
didn't do enough or do it well.

387
00:39:34,021 --> 00:39:35,842
I ignored your emotional needs.

388
00:39:36,852 --> 00:39:37,852
Look at you.

389
00:39:37,933 --> 00:39:39,872
You haven't even had a proper relationship.

390
00:39:42,306 --> 00:39:43,722
What are you saying?

391
00:39:43,963 --> 00:39:45,242
I'm doing well now.

392
00:39:45,642 --> 00:39:47,282
I'm doing fine with Shan Shan.

393
00:39:47,923 --> 00:39:51,743
I was like you. I liked to be free and unrestrained.

394
00:39:52,122 --> 00:39:54,233
So, I didn't know how to love and be loved.

395
00:39:56,883 --> 00:39:58,392
But after meeting Shan Shan,

396
00:39:58,483 --> 00:40:01,863
I suddenly understood what I wanted and became more determined.

397
00:40:02,147 --> 00:40:03,642
We are both serious about each other.

398
00:40:03,721 --> 00:40:08,032
So, I will work hard and also have a good relationship.

399
00:40:09,683 --> 00:40:11,714
Oh, that's great.

400
00:40:15,659 --> 00:40:17,002
Let's talk about you too.

401
00:40:17,443 --> 00:40:18,682
You and Ms. Yi.

402
00:40:21,242 --> 00:40:22,242
She...

403
00:40:22,861 --> 00:40:24,282
She always has worries,

404
00:40:26,604 --> 00:40:28,035
and she never wants

405
00:40:28,163 --> 00:40:31,343
to enter my social circle or my family.

406
00:40:32,187 --> 00:40:33,842
Look at the day at the horse ranch.

407
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:38,280
Was it because of me?

408
00:40:42,322 --> 00:40:45,622
Let me talk to her.

409
00:40:47,722 --> 00:40:48,743
Okay.

410
00:40:51,005 --> 00:40:52,059
(Tang Yi)

411
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:57,820
Hello?

412
00:40:59,936 --> 00:41:01,003
What?

413
00:41:03,242 --> 00:41:04,562
How are you now?

414
00:41:05,003 --> 00:41:06,472
Don't move. I'm coming right away.

415
00:41:18,963 --> 00:41:19,963
It's swollen.

416
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:22,234
It's nothing serious.

417
00:41:22,523 --> 00:41:24,403
It's just that when I was taking a shower,

418
00:41:24,483 --> 00:41:26,642
the bathroom was too slippery and I slipped.

419
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:30,002
I'll get some ice in a bit for you to put it on.

420
00:41:31,908 --> 00:41:34,219
- What about here?   - It's fine. Here.

421
00:41:41,162 --> 00:41:42,642
You really have to be careful.

422
00:41:48,763 --> 00:41:50,842
I really want to be by your side.

423
00:41:51,202 --> 00:41:52,833
We should look out for each other.

424
00:42:07,468 --> 00:42:09,082
Guan Ji wants to talk to you.

425
00:42:13,116 --> 00:42:14,362
Guan Ji?

426
00:42:15,714 --> 00:42:16,842
Is that okay?

427
00:42:21,396 --> 00:42:22,746
Let me think about it.

428
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:36,601
I'll get you some ice.

429
00:42:52,282 --> 00:42:54,113
Shu Yi, what are you doing?
