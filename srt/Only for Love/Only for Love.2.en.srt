00:01:30,929 --> 00:01:36,060
(Only For Love)

2
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,002
(Episode 2)

3
00:02:23,442 --> 00:02:25,348
I'll go back first.

4
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,200
Can you stay with me a little longer?

5
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:28,593
I'm afraid when the sun rises,

6
00:02:28,674 --> 00:02:30,654
I'll find out that all this was a dream.

7
00:02:31,602 --> 00:02:32,732
Are you cold?

8
00:02:32,882 --> 00:02:34,541
I'm not cold when you're here.

9
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,201
But I really have to go back.

10
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,861
I still have to go to work tomorrow morning.

11
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,169
Xing Zhou.

12
00:02:41,281 --> 00:02:43,571
I hope you think through what I said.

13
00:02:43,858 --> 00:02:45,897
What she can give you, I can give you too.

14
00:02:45,984 --> 00:02:48,435
What she can't give you, I can give you too.

15
00:02:51,202 --> 00:02:52,362
Alright then.

16
00:02:52,442 --> 00:02:54,682
My uncle is still waiting for me there.

17
00:02:54,762 --> 00:02:56,091
I'll go first.

18
00:02:56,512 --> 00:02:58,642
- I'll take you there.   - Okay.

19
00:03:20,937 --> 00:03:22,697
My mom specially went to the temple to pray for it.

20
00:03:22,778 --> 00:03:23,819
It's good for our relationship.

21
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,906
If you wear it,

22
00:03:24,987 --> 00:03:27,038
we two will definitely grow old together.

23
00:03:27,681 --> 00:03:29,462
You want to tie me down, right?

24
00:04:27,161 --> 00:04:28,411
Shu Yi.

25
00:04:29,472 --> 00:04:30,522
Shu Yi.

26
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,220
Let me explain.

27
00:04:32,716 --> 00:04:34,002
Sorry. It's all my fault.

28
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,322
If you're asking for my forgiveness, save it.

29
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,201
Let's break up. I wish you happiness.

30
00:04:40,011 --> 00:04:41,712
Shu Yi.

31
00:05:02,492 --> 00:05:03,661
Shu Yi.

32
00:05:09,682 --> 00:05:11,012
Let's break up.

33
00:05:16,122 --> 00:05:17,252
Shu Yi.

34
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,802
I love you.

35
00:05:18,905 --> 00:05:20,724
And, I want to be with you forever.

36
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:23,921
But this kind of life,

37
00:05:24,002 --> 00:05:25,386
I really can't take it anymore.

38
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,531
It's like I can never see where the end is.

39
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:29,851
What does that mean?

40
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,762
Before I met her,

41
00:05:35,124 --> 00:05:37,506
I always believed that hard work was meaningful.

42
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,531
I also believed that I could fulfill your expectations of me.

43
00:05:41,882 --> 00:05:43,581
But then, I realized

44
00:05:43,961 --> 00:05:47,675
that with just our bare hands, coming to a city with no roots,

45
00:05:47,929 --> 00:05:49,590
we can't make something out of it,

46
00:05:49,721 --> 00:05:50,922
not even in 10 lifetimes.

47
00:05:51,002 --> 00:05:53,422
Some people have a good life from the moment they are born.

48
00:05:57,841 --> 00:05:59,212
I don't want to work hard anymore.

49
00:05:59,721 --> 00:06:02,012
I don't have that much motivation and ambition.

50
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,333
I don't have a strong belief in journalists like you,

51
00:06:04,443 --> 00:06:07,202
believing that we can make a new world with our own hands.

52
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:09,501
Do you know what her family is like?

53
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,642
All digits on her uncle's license plate are repeated.

54
00:06:17,762 --> 00:06:19,381
This is my only chance.

55
00:06:20,191 --> 00:06:21,600
Sorry, Shu Yi.

56
00:06:22,601 --> 00:06:24,542
If you want,

57
00:06:25,249 --> 00:06:27,002
we can still be best friends.

58
00:06:29,113 --> 00:06:30,402
Yue Xing Zhou.

59
00:06:31,762 --> 00:06:33,501
Did you bring my phone?

60
00:06:33,682 --> 00:06:35,012
I brought it.

61
00:06:41,994 --> 00:06:44,202
Who wants to be your friend? Get out of my sight!

62
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,129
No way.

63
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,099
(Today is really a day of being drenched by the rain.)

64
00:07:39,534 --> 00:07:41,362
(Hurry and drink a bowl of hot ginger tea.)

65
00:07:41,487 --> 00:07:42,796
(Don't catch a cold.)

66
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,922
(Mom, don't worry.)

67
00:08:24,161 --> 00:08:25,372
Your wine.

68
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,650
Thank you.

69
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,762
This place looks good.

70
00:08:31,961 --> 00:08:34,942
Right, I feel really good.

71
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:36,362
My company has overtime every day.

72
00:08:36,442 --> 00:08:37,681
I'm so tired.

73
00:08:37,761 --> 00:08:39,661
I came to find you to relax.

74
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,480
What about your project? It's not finished yet?

75
00:08:42,562 --> 00:08:43,962
Don't mention it.

76
00:08:44,042 --> 00:08:45,161
(What happened?)

77
00:08:45,241 --> 00:08:47,222
(You couldn't interview that person?)

78
00:08:59,365 --> 00:09:02,282
(Whether or not God punishes you, and whether you act like a doting wife)

79
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:04,626
(have no connection whatsoever.)

80
00:09:11,436 --> 00:09:14,583
Your simple mind looks cute.

81
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,602
What does that mean?

82
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,350
You bought me a drink.

83
00:09:26,601 --> 00:09:29,022
But it's not enough for anything to happen between us.

84
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:41,986
Can you believe the story after that?

85
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:44,162
He only took away the most valuable thing.

86
00:09:44,264 --> 00:09:45,924
A golden brooch.

87
00:09:46,582 --> 00:09:48,962
Yue Xing Zhou is quite a talent.

88
00:09:51,001 --> 00:09:52,171
Let me tell you.

89
00:09:52,507 --> 00:09:54,726
When we broke up, I was only a little angry.

90
00:09:54,881 --> 00:09:56,439
But after seeing all this,

91
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,845
I almost died on the spot! It's just...

92
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,667
Alright, don't be mad.

93
00:10:03,748 --> 00:10:05,589
It's not worth it for this kind of person.

94
00:10:05,881 --> 00:10:07,982
I already told you before, right?

95
00:10:08,082 --> 00:10:10,064
This kind of man should not be accepted.

96
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,121
It's still uncertain whether he can achieve nirvana,

97
00:10:12,193 --> 00:10:14,321
and he has already scorched your precious feathers before that.

98
00:10:14,601 --> 00:10:16,051
It's really not worth it.

99
00:10:18,721 --> 00:10:20,761
I want to turn my grief into motivation for work.

100
00:10:20,841 --> 00:10:23,668
I'm going to work and continuing to conquer Shi Yan tomorrow.

101
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:29,021
Be honest with me.

102
00:10:29,802 --> 00:10:32,722
Didn't you feel a bit sad being cheated?

103
00:10:33,856 --> 00:10:36,636
The only thing that makes me sad is that I'm not even worth a car.

104
00:10:37,144 --> 00:10:40,055
If I had known earlier at the hospital, I would have kicked that car.

105
00:10:40,185 --> 00:10:41,424
Luckily, you didn't kick it.

106
00:10:41,552 --> 00:10:43,842
Otherwise, you would have been left with nothing but debts.

107
00:10:44,522 --> 00:10:46,242
This man, Yue Xing Zhou.

108
00:10:46,417 --> 00:10:49,089
When he was chasing you and everyone in college knew about it,

109
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,690
I warned you to be careful.

110
00:10:50,802 --> 00:10:52,921
Then, you got a job and he chased you again,

111
00:10:53,001 --> 00:10:54,498
everyone in the company knew about it.

112
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,300
I still warned you to be careful.

113
00:10:56,601 --> 00:10:57,852
It's a pity.

114
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,369
A persistent pursuer can soften the staunchest lady's heart.

115
00:11:02,761 --> 00:11:04,926
He chased me for five whole years.

116
00:11:05,007 --> 00:11:06,927
Just when we were together, he cheated on me.

117
00:11:07,082 --> 00:11:09,492
How can someone change so easily?

118
00:11:10,051 --> 00:11:11,770
It's only when we enter society

119
00:11:11,881 --> 00:11:16,083
that people realize bread is much more important than love.

120
00:11:16,682 --> 00:11:19,362
That's why I always say wise men don't fall in love.

121
00:11:19,442 --> 00:11:21,073
Women should focus on their careers.

122
00:11:21,202 --> 00:11:23,774
Only you yourself and what you get with your own effort

123
00:11:23,926 --> 00:11:26,122
will never betray you.

124
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,060
I understand the principle,

125
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,922
but I won't accept losing to a car.

126
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:33,522
If you don't accept it, win and prove your worth to him.

127
00:11:34,911 --> 00:11:36,971
It seems to make sense.

128
00:11:37,761 --> 00:11:39,802
Bottom-up for me. You do you.

129
00:11:40,152 --> 00:11:41,521
It's hot.

130
00:12:26,721 --> 00:12:27,821
Eight.

131
00:12:28,124 --> 00:12:29,224
Nine.

132
00:12:31,891 --> 00:12:33,180
It's impressive.

133
00:12:33,322 --> 00:12:35,021
But she's not recommended.

134
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,050
Three years too.

135
00:13:25,716 --> 00:13:27,755
(Uncle.)

136
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,522
Good morning, Yu Ling.

137
00:14:10,643 --> 00:14:11,853
Morning.

138
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,099
Did the interview go smoothly yesterday?

139
00:14:15,386 --> 00:14:16,560
Mr. Shi had something come up suddenly.

140
00:14:16,643 --> 00:14:17,932
We changed the time.

141
00:14:19,202 --> 00:14:21,691
Mr. Shi likes to change things around.

142
00:14:21,841 --> 00:14:23,482
It's okay. We're journalists.

143
00:14:23,608 --> 00:14:25,467
We have to embrace change, right?

144
00:14:32,468 --> 00:14:35,199
- How was last night?   - I didn't get to interview Shi Yan.

145
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,440
Something came up suddenly.

146
00:14:36,553 --> 00:14:38,632
I'm rescheduling with his assistant, Mr. Chen.

147
00:14:38,721 --> 00:14:40,291
I'll definitely submit it on time.

148
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,740
Why are you wearing sunglasses?

149
00:14:45,912 --> 00:14:48,437
Is the indoor light too bright?

150
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:57,401
Since the interview didn't go through yesterday,

151
00:14:57,481 --> 00:14:59,362
you could have celebrated your boyfriend's birthday.

152
00:14:59,442 --> 00:15:01,462
Why do you look so haggard?

153
00:15:04,898 --> 00:15:06,427
Did your boyfriend cheat on you?

154
00:15:08,698 --> 00:15:10,759
I'm right, am I not?

155
00:15:11,113 --> 00:15:13,013
Yue Xing Zhou

156
00:15:13,562 --> 00:15:15,181
cheated on you.

157
00:15:19,282 --> 00:15:20,451
Ms. Yi.

158
00:15:20,641 --> 00:15:22,401
My boyfriend cheated on me.

159
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:23,748
Why do you look happy?

160
00:15:23,865 --> 00:15:26,614
Sorry.

161
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:29,120
I'll control my emotions.

162
00:15:33,402 --> 00:15:34,612
Shu Yi.

163
00:15:35,562 --> 00:15:37,122
I told you before,

164
00:15:37,642 --> 00:15:39,851
you and Yue Xing Zhou are not suitable for each other.

165
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:42,522
When you reach my age, you will understand.

166
00:15:42,604 --> 00:15:45,054
For two people to stay together forever,

167
00:15:45,546 --> 00:15:47,446
compatibility is more important than anything else.

168
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,680
Yue Xing Zhou and I are not compatible.

169
00:15:50,761 --> 00:15:52,442
Then, what kind of person am I compatible with?

170
00:15:52,522 --> 00:15:55,240
You have knowledge, good looks, a decent job,

171
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,540
and an unlimited future.

172
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,542
You are right. I have to go to work.

173
00:16:01,802 --> 00:16:03,051
Wait.

174
00:16:04,202 --> 00:16:05,801
Do you want to take two more days off?

175
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,451
After all, you just had a breakup.

176
00:16:10,162 --> 00:16:12,399
My dark circles were from staying up late to revise

177
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,402
the interview outline for Shi Yan.

178
00:16:14,522 --> 00:16:17,141
It's not for that unfaithful man.

179
00:16:18,442 --> 00:16:19,691
Very well.

180
00:16:20,241 --> 00:16:22,033
Keep your fighting spirit.

181
00:16:22,241 --> 00:16:25,322
Le'an Technology has confirmed Chen Kang's interview.

182
00:16:25,447 --> 00:16:28,623
Go and take the opportunity to change your mood.

183
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:37,541
She's even more ambitious than when I was young.

184
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:48,202
She always gets special treatment without fear.

185
00:17:07,507 --> 00:17:09,207
Miss Zheng, it's settled then.

186
00:17:09,409 --> 00:17:11,329
Le'an Technology is a start-up company.

187
00:17:11,417 --> 00:17:12,658
We hope that through this interview

188
00:17:12,739 --> 00:17:14,258
the public can understand us better

189
00:17:14,352 --> 00:17:16,592
and investors can have more confidence in us.

190
00:17:16,681 --> 00:17:19,362
Our CEO, Mr. Chen is not good at expressing himself.

191
00:17:19,467 --> 00:17:20,867
Please bear with him.

192
00:17:21,002 --> 00:17:23,321
Thank you for choosing Financial Introduce.

193
00:17:23,401 --> 00:17:24,682
I will also prepare well.

194
00:17:24,762 --> 00:17:26,202
Please ask Mr. Chen not to be nervous.

195
00:17:26,282 --> 00:17:28,722
We will talk about what he is good at and what he knows.

196
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,959
Okay, I'll go and get busy now.

197
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,122
Okay.

198
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:04,491
The weather is nice today. Do you want to go shopping in the evening?

199
00:18:04,601 --> 00:18:05,701
Okay.

200
00:18:37,006 --> 00:18:40,016
Miss. Today's egg tarts have a buy-one-get-one deal.

201
00:18:40,121 --> 00:18:41,370
What do you think?

202
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,859
Can you help me pack them?

203
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,852
- Sure.   - Thank you.

204
00:18:50,321 --> 00:18:52,962
When are you going to ask your uncle to let me work at Mingyu Group?

205
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:54,962
I heard he is very interested in our company.

206
00:18:55,043 --> 00:18:56,480
If I go, I should be able to help him.

207
00:18:56,591 --> 00:19:00,042
Xing Zhou, Mingyu Group has a strict hiring system.

208
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,900
It's not easy to get someone in.

209
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:05,699
Even I had to go through several interviews before I got in.

210
00:19:05,802 --> 00:19:07,841
And my uncle,

211
00:19:07,921 --> 00:19:09,462
he doesn't like special privileges in the company.

212
00:19:09,543 --> 00:19:12,202
You don't want to leave him with a bad impression, right?

213
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,133
Let's take it slow, okay?

214
00:19:15,002 --> 00:19:16,102
I understand.

215
00:19:16,183 --> 00:19:18,842
So, when do you plan to talk to your uncle?

216
00:19:19,762 --> 00:19:22,081
I'm thinking of our future

217
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,002
and I don't want you to wait too long.

218
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,341
Xing Zhou, I'm hungry.

219
00:19:30,531 --> 00:19:31,940
I want to eat egg tarts.

220
00:19:39,681 --> 00:19:41,715
Shu Yi, this is Qin Le.

221
00:19:43,361 --> 00:19:44,521
Excuse me.

222
00:19:44,655 --> 00:19:45,935
Give way.

223
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,210
What are you looking at?

224
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:01,050
Someone actually likes second-hand goods?

225
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,842
- Xing Zhou, she said you're second-hand.   - Forget it.

226
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,339
She said you're second-hand goods.

227
00:20:08,434 --> 00:20:09,764
It's okay.

228
00:20:11,721 --> 00:20:14,681
Mr. Shi, you already rushed back to meet Chen Kang yesterday.

229
00:20:14,762 --> 00:20:16,580
Why do you have to come to Le'an Technology today?

230
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:18,907
To understand the real progress of their research

231
00:20:19,042 --> 00:20:20,522
and to appease him.

232
00:20:20,699 --> 00:20:22,722
Feng Hua's approach yesterday was problematic.

233
00:20:22,881 --> 00:20:25,045
Yunchuang can't leave such an impression to the outside world.

234
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,999
Fortunately, you're here.

235
00:20:32,216 --> 00:20:33,424
I just received the news

236
00:20:33,505 --> 00:20:35,711
that they have also contacted several other investment companies,

237
00:20:35,792 --> 00:20:38,211
including one foreign investment bank.

238
00:20:38,921 --> 00:20:40,980
Chen Kang is an ambitious and passionate person.

239
00:20:41,486 --> 00:20:43,166
If he wanted to cooperate with foreign countries,

240
00:20:43,247 --> 00:20:44,804
he wouldn't wait until now.

241
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:46,800
We can just move forward as usual.

242
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,120
But Mr. Zhang and Mr. Tian...

243
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,255
The more it is this time, the more important it is to stay steady.

244
00:20:51,336 --> 00:20:54,336
We must do things properly so that everyone has nothing to say.

245
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,442
Dirtball.

246
00:21:05,601 --> 00:21:07,082
Cheating couple.

247
00:21:07,273 --> 00:21:08,882
Go to hell.

248
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,680
The rich uncle, right?

249
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,800
Wanting to not work hard for 20 years, right?

250
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,676
Then, I'll finish the interview with Shi Yan first

251
00:21:34,757 --> 00:21:36,338
and then take care of him.

252
00:21:37,051 --> 00:21:40,442
I'll make you guys not even be able to enter their door.

253
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,683
Mr. Shi,

254
00:21:45,764 --> 00:21:48,924
Mr. Zhang and Mr. Tian will also come to attend tomorrow's meeting.

255
00:21:49,137 --> 00:21:51,922
Maybe they will still bring up the Lieying's matter.

256
00:21:52,681 --> 00:21:54,281
Remind those in Lieying

257
00:21:54,407 --> 00:21:57,122
to give me the solution to the problem I want.

258
00:21:57,322 --> 00:21:59,482
Regarding Mr. Tian and Mr. Zhang,

259
00:21:59,881 --> 00:22:02,321
no matter who wants to invest in which company,

260
00:22:02,401 --> 00:22:04,281
they have to wait for the final assessment result.

261
00:22:04,361 --> 00:22:05,761
It has to be approved by the majority.

262
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,211
Understood.

263
00:22:07,962 --> 00:22:09,411
Shall we go now, Mr. Shi?

264
00:22:28,641 --> 00:22:29,801
Sorry to bother you, sir.

265
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:31,503
Can I ask you for a favor?

266
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:36,481
It's like this.

267
00:22:36,562 --> 00:22:38,162
My phone is almost out of battery.

268
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,620
Can I borrow your power bank?

269
00:22:41,161 --> 00:22:42,731
I don't have a power bank.

270
00:22:43,802 --> 00:22:45,211
Oh, I see.

271
00:22:46,002 --> 00:22:48,722
Well then, can you give me a ride?

272
00:22:48,802 --> 00:22:50,514
I want to charge my phone in your car.

273
00:23:29,962 --> 00:23:32,162
But my car won't take a woman with a boyfriend.

274
00:23:32,282 --> 00:23:33,572
Miss Zheng.

275
00:23:36,482 --> 00:23:37,771
Miss Zheng.

276
00:23:43,681 --> 00:23:44,781
Mr. Shi.

277
00:23:46,562 --> 00:23:49,059
Actually, I'm here to arrange an exclusive interview with you.

278
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,722
I don't know if you have time right now.

279
00:23:53,161 --> 00:23:55,380
If you can't find a whole block of time,

280
00:23:55,499 --> 00:23:57,802
I can interview you while you commute.

281
00:23:57,921 --> 00:24:00,251
So, it won't interrupt your work schedule.

282
00:24:01,762 --> 00:24:04,741
If I can't submit the draft this week, the magazine could go on hiatus.

283
00:24:08,467 --> 00:24:10,827
Commuting is my personal time.

284
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:12,970
Miss Zheng, if you want to make an appointment,

285
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:14,482
you can contact my assistant.

286
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,210
Mr. Shi.

287
00:24:26,441 --> 00:24:28,261
- Mr. Shi, she...   - What?

288
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:30,962
Do you want to get off the car to arrange time with her?

289
00:24:37,082 --> 00:24:39,411
Miss Zheng is a bit strange.

290
00:24:39,762 --> 00:24:41,281
Last time at Warner Estate,

291
00:24:41,361 --> 00:24:43,102
you wanted to drive her

292
00:24:43,283 --> 00:24:45,042
but she refused without even thinking.

293
00:24:45,161 --> 00:24:48,162
This time, she was desperate to get on our car.

294
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:49,652
Could it be...

295
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,962
Okay, Editor-in-Chief.

296
00:25:09,031 --> 00:25:10,161
I understand.

297
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:12,036
If Zheng Shu Yi can't finish it,

298
00:25:12,129 --> 00:25:15,411
I'll make Yu Ling's draft the headline.

299
00:25:29,401 --> 00:25:30,971
Yu Ling, come here.

300
00:25:36,002 --> 00:25:37,102
Come in.

301
00:25:37,681 --> 00:25:39,052
Editor, are you looking for me?

302
00:25:40,441 --> 00:25:43,075
Yu Ling, how's your article coming along?

303
00:25:43,314 --> 00:25:44,954
It's finished. I'm just revising it.

304
00:25:45,042 --> 00:25:47,442
Okay. Then, go back and revise it properly.

305
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,800
Okay.

306
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:54,389
Editor, Shu Yi hasn't interviewed Shi Yan yet.

307
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,050
Will there be any problems?

308
00:25:56,881 --> 00:25:59,361
The interviewee temporarily changed the interview time.

309
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,101
That's normal.

310
00:26:01,562 --> 00:26:03,841
Yu Ling, you're an experienced journalist.

311
00:26:03,921 --> 00:26:06,182
You should know very well between your article

312
00:26:06,263 --> 00:26:07,922
and the interview with Shi Yan

313
00:26:08,088 --> 00:26:10,162
which has more news value

314
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,100
and should be on the headline.

315
00:26:15,881 --> 00:26:16,922
To be honest,

316
00:26:17,002 --> 00:26:20,322
Zheng Shu Yi is immature in many ways compared to you,

317
00:26:20,441 --> 00:26:23,020
so the editor-in-chief recommended you to interview Shi Yan.

318
00:26:23,101 --> 00:26:24,122
But, you also saw yourself

319
00:26:24,203 --> 00:26:27,042
that Shi Yan chose Shu Yi's outline in the end.

320
00:26:27,207 --> 00:26:29,511
Of course, maybe he as an entrepreneur,

321
00:26:29,641 --> 00:26:31,981
he is more inclined to give opportunities to newcomers.

322
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,401
That's how it is now.

323
00:26:33,538 --> 00:26:35,842
You should prepare well for the next topic

324
00:26:35,951 --> 00:26:38,011
instead of worrying about this interview.

325
00:26:38,528 --> 00:26:39,647
I understand, Editor.

326
00:26:39,747 --> 00:26:41,992
I'm just worried that the next issue of the magazine might have a hiatus.

327
00:26:42,073 --> 00:26:43,103
This is not personal.

328
00:26:45,005 --> 00:26:48,035
One thing I admire about you is that you always think of the big picture.

329
00:26:48,282 --> 00:26:50,402
You should go back and revise your draft first.

330
00:26:50,497 --> 00:26:53,262
If Zheng Shu Yi couldn't interview Shi Yan this week,

331
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:56,332
we'll have to use your draft instead.

332
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,849
No problem.

333
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,802
- Thanks for your hard work.   - I'll go and get busy now.

334
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,770
Miss Xu.

335
00:27:19,641 --> 00:27:21,741
Okay, got it.

336
00:27:24,594 --> 00:27:25,962
Zheng Shu Yi,

337
00:27:26,043 --> 00:27:28,424
I'm sorry to tell you

338
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,239
that Shi Yan does have a niece

339
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,040
and his legendary brother-in-law is indeed surnamed Qin,

340
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:36,791
who is now the general manager of Mingyu Group.

341
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,280
Legend?

342
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,529
Yeah.

343
00:27:39,872 --> 00:27:41,872
There are so many stories about his family.

344
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:44,535
And, you can only hear them in legends.

345
00:27:44,833 --> 00:27:45,966
You must have heard of it.

346
00:27:46,047 --> 00:27:47,210
A few years ago,

347
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:50,282
Mingyu encountered a major crisis and almost didn't make it.

348
00:27:50,761 --> 00:27:53,201
When everyone was trying to figure out a solution,

349
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:55,105
Shi Yan disappeared.

350
00:27:55,433 --> 00:27:57,602
He went out and started his own company.

351
00:27:57,841 --> 00:27:59,946
And, the company he started

352
00:28:00,082 --> 00:28:02,080
was using the name of Mingyu.

353
00:28:03,562 --> 00:28:05,355
Were you and Kong Nan under his bed?

354
00:28:05,436 --> 00:28:06,725
How did you know so well?

355
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:11,739
And Shi Yan's sister is super mysterious.

356
00:28:11,921 --> 00:28:13,941
Some say she is abroad.

357
00:28:15,201 --> 00:28:17,302
Some say she is not alive anymore.

358
00:28:17,408 --> 00:28:18,967
Some say she is a superstar.

359
00:28:19,048 --> 00:28:20,522
There are all kinds of rumors.

360
00:28:20,681 --> 00:28:24,771
But there has never been any official public information about her.

361
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:28,922
The Shi family is very strict when it comes to privacy protection.

362
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,922
And after Shi Yan left,

363
00:28:31,066 --> 00:28:32,666
he had even less contact with the media.

364
00:28:32,853 --> 00:28:33,892
I know.

365
00:28:33,973 --> 00:28:37,341
Otherwise, I wouldn't have failed to recognize him twice.

366
00:28:41,002 --> 00:28:43,722
Turns out Shi Yan is that mistress's uncle.

367
00:28:44,123 --> 00:28:46,282
Alas, what is fate...

368
00:28:51,546 --> 00:28:52,866
(Oh no!)

369
00:28:52,947 --> 00:28:54,722
(Xu Yu Ling went to see the editor.)

370
00:28:54,881 --> 00:28:57,011
(Is your duck about to fly away again?)

371
00:28:57,681 --> 00:28:59,286
(You must interview Shi Yan this week.)

372
00:29:02,042 --> 00:29:03,332
To be honest,

373
00:29:04,267 --> 00:29:06,162
I really feel sorry for you.

374
00:29:06,361 --> 00:29:08,202
But what you need now is not sympathy,

375
00:29:08,282 --> 00:29:09,561
but an explanation.

376
00:29:09,735 --> 00:29:12,972
Look. You rejected Shi Yan's advances first,

377
00:29:13,143 --> 00:29:16,002
and now you're turning around and actively asking him.

378
00:29:16,176 --> 00:29:18,764
How do you plan to explain this matter to him?

379
00:29:21,641 --> 00:29:22,841
Can I not explain it?

380
00:29:22,936 --> 00:29:24,266
Yes, you can.

381
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,470
Just don't appear in front of him anymore.

382
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,720
(What should I do about my interview?)

383
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:39,864
Oh yeah, when is the interview with Financial Introduce scheduled?

384
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:41,522
You're fully booked this week.

385
00:29:41,601 --> 00:29:43,578
It'll have to be scheduled for next week at the earliest.

386
00:29:44,361 --> 00:29:46,451
Miss Zheng might not have an issue this time.

387
00:29:47,458 --> 00:29:49,318
Let's schedule it for the earliest time possible.

388
00:29:49,924 --> 00:29:51,623
Next Monday at the earliest.

389
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,602
Mr. Chen,

390
00:30:01,737 --> 00:30:05,242
can Mr. Shi find some time today to do the interview?

391
00:30:06,945 --> 00:30:08,759
(Mr. Shi has to go to a meeting without having lunch.)

392
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,100
(He really doesn't have time. Sorry.)

393
00:30:11,681 --> 00:30:14,202
Mr. Chen, what about lunchtime?

394
00:30:14,282 --> 00:30:16,601
Can Mr. Shi find a little bit of time?

395
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:17,762
Please.

396
00:30:18,879 --> 00:30:20,559
(Sorry, Miss Zheng.)

397
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,150
(Mr. Shi probably won't be done until late tonight.)

398
00:30:24,503 --> 00:30:25,639
What about the weekend?

399
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,250
I can work overtime.

400
00:30:28,522 --> 00:30:30,240
(Miss Zheng, sorry.)

401
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,931
(Looking forward to it.)

402
00:30:53,841 --> 00:30:56,842
(I haven't gone to Mingyu Yunchuang to interview Shi Yan.)

403
00:30:57,018 --> 00:30:58,688
(He's about to go to work at Mingyu.)

404
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:06,362
(So, you need to speed up your progress.)

405
00:31:14,762 --> 00:31:16,461
We have to face the difficulties.

406
00:31:17,121 --> 00:31:18,532
I'll do the interview.

407
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,579
I'll handle the people too.

408
00:31:21,522 --> 00:31:22,622
It's okay.

409
00:31:23,042 --> 00:31:24,372
I can do it.

410
00:31:43,802 --> 00:31:46,731
Mr. Shi, this is Yunchuang's third-quarter financial report.

411
00:31:50,231 --> 00:31:52,482
After coming back from Le'an, you have been working overtime every day.

412
00:31:52,598 --> 00:31:54,518
You should take a rest on the weekends.

413
00:31:54,647 --> 00:31:56,991
The meeting later probably won't be that easy.

414
00:31:59,962 --> 00:32:01,171
Don't worry.

415
00:32:01,412 --> 00:32:03,111
We will eventually get through this.

416
00:32:03,281 --> 00:32:05,560
Rather than being deadlocked here, it's a waste of time.

417
00:32:05,641 --> 00:32:09,198
It's better to just lay out the facts and see how they respond.

418
00:32:09,601 --> 00:32:10,812
Right.

419
00:32:11,282 --> 00:32:12,862
I'm actually more worried about your father.

420
00:32:12,943 --> 00:32:14,434
The chairman's side.

421
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:16,482
Mr. Tian and the others are all veterans of Mingyu.

422
00:32:16,562 --> 00:32:18,722
When Mingyu had trouble a few years ago, they didn't leave.

423
00:32:18,802 --> 00:32:20,392
They also helped with your entrepreneurship.

424
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:22,145
You have been so persistent.

425
00:32:22,242 --> 00:32:23,279
Will the chairman not be?

426
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,489
No.

427
00:32:25,841 --> 00:32:27,251
That's good.

428
00:32:36,802 --> 00:32:37,931
But

429
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,136
he probably won't help me either.

430
00:32:42,176 --> 00:32:45,776
Mr. Qiu, please report the third quarter financial report for Yunchuang.

431
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:47,052
Okay.

432
00:32:47,794 --> 00:32:49,040
The total assets in the third quarter

433
00:32:49,121 --> 00:32:51,361
increased by 11% compared to the last quarter.

434
00:32:51,441 --> 00:32:54,356
It is expected that the growth rate in the next quarter can reach 20%.

435
00:32:54,641 --> 00:32:56,841
In general, the situation of Yunchuang this year

436
00:32:56,921 --> 00:32:58,282
is still quite optimistic.

437
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,802
Well done.

438
00:33:00,881 --> 00:33:02,202
Well done.

439
00:33:02,282 --> 00:33:04,442
You didn't fail us.

440
00:33:04,536 --> 00:33:07,575
I believe that after Yunchuang takes over Lieying,

441
00:33:07,656 --> 00:33:10,136
this data will be better.

442
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,282
Didn't Mr. Feng report to you?

443
00:33:15,937 --> 00:33:19,261
Lieying has not been updated on the solution to the core problem.

444
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:20,842
To put it directly.

445
00:33:20,949 --> 00:33:22,704
Lieying is more like a middleman.

446
00:33:22,785 --> 00:33:24,162
Once the funding chain is broken,

447
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:28,041
problems will arise if they can't develop technology independently.

448
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,481
Yunchuang is just starting out.

449
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:32,170
It's very risky to invest in such a company.

450
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:36,092
Getting the support of Guan Capital and taking over Lieying.

451
00:33:36,209 --> 00:33:38,482
It would only be a good thing.

452
00:33:38,802 --> 00:33:40,461
How could there be a problem?

453
00:33:41,601 --> 00:33:43,642
I have discussed with Guan Ji these two days.

454
00:33:43,722 --> 00:33:44,722
In addition to profits,

455
00:33:44,802 --> 00:33:46,941
it is also important to bear social responsibility.

456
00:33:47,022 --> 00:33:49,755
For companies like Lieying, they have more choices.

457
00:33:49,836 --> 00:33:51,397
But now, there are many young people

458
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,039
who are willing to do something meaningful for society.

459
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,921
They need us more.

460
00:33:56,042 --> 00:33:58,281
So, even if we can get the support of Guan Capital,

461
00:33:58,361 --> 00:34:01,841
I still hope to contribute to Yunchuang's future strategy.

462
00:34:01,921 --> 00:34:03,041
Talking about the future,

463
00:34:03,121 --> 00:34:04,915
Yunchuang has been established for three years.

464
00:34:04,996 --> 00:34:06,722
The recognition is not high enough.

465
00:34:06,802 --> 00:34:09,641
The corporate image is related to the long-term development of Yunchuang.

466
00:34:09,721 --> 00:34:11,844
We must pay attention to this.

467
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:14,649
There have been many

468
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:17,802
statements and speculations about Mingyu and Yunchuang.

469
00:34:17,882 --> 00:34:19,211
At the appropriate time,

470
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:21,269
you can also clarify it.

471
00:34:21,795 --> 00:34:24,882
The good news about Yunchuang and Guan Capital's cooperation

472
00:34:25,082 --> 00:34:26,960
should be shared with everyone as soon as possible.

473
00:34:27,066 --> 00:34:30,060
We should let everyone see the strength of Yunchuang.

474
00:34:31,055 --> 00:34:32,134
Mr. Li is right.

475
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,600
We want everyone to see the strength of Yunchuang.

476
00:34:34,761 --> 00:34:37,242
But if there is no achievement after cooperation,

477
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,842
even if it is widely publicized,

478
00:34:38,941 --> 00:34:40,393
it will be meaningless.

479
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:43,038
On the contrary, if there is an achievement,

480
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:44,518
everyone will have their own judgment.

481
00:34:46,241 --> 00:34:47,492
Shi Yan,

482
00:34:47,842 --> 00:34:50,764
you should pay attention to those opinions about you.

483
00:34:51,177 --> 00:34:55,439
Otherwise, it's not good for Yunchuang.

484
00:34:56,029 --> 00:34:57,279
Of course.

485
00:34:57,575 --> 00:34:59,759
Now that we have three years of financial reports,

486
00:34:59,887 --> 00:35:01,960
the cooperation between Guan Capital and Yunchuang is imminent.

487
00:35:02,041 --> 00:35:03,625
I also have a little bit of confidence

488
00:35:03,721 --> 00:35:05,781
to accept an interview from Financial Introduce.

489
00:35:15,281 --> 00:35:17,201
Mr. Shi, you're so busy that you haven't eaten yet.

490
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,652
Let's have something to eat first.

491
00:35:19,201 --> 00:35:20,322
Thank you.

492
00:35:20,721 --> 00:35:22,741
What work do you have planned for this week?

493
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,879
The work for this week has already been completed in advance.

494
00:35:26,922 --> 00:35:29,162
What can be brought forward?

495
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:31,999
Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang, whom you wanted to have dinner with,

496
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,602
won't be able to return until next week.

497
00:35:33,683 --> 00:35:35,562
It might not be possible.

498
00:35:40,162 --> 00:35:42,122
- Didn't I say it at the meeting?   - Right.

499
00:35:42,203 --> 00:35:44,003
What about the interview with Financial Introduce?

500
00:35:44,121 --> 00:35:45,452
Do it earlier.

501
00:36:02,681 --> 00:36:04,002
What did Miss Zheng say to you?

502
00:36:04,153 --> 00:36:06,008
She kept asking if you had time tomorrow.

503
00:36:06,104 --> 00:36:07,322
She can work overtime.

504
00:36:09,241 --> 00:36:11,885
I'm going to accompany Uncle Guan to horse riding tomorrow afternoon.

505
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,710
I can free up some time between lunch and departure time.

506
00:36:16,801 --> 00:36:18,462
Sure, I'll arrange it.

507
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,760
Yu Ling.

508
00:36:36,882 --> 00:36:38,012
Thanks.

509
00:36:52,842 --> 00:36:54,122
Nan Nan.

510
00:36:54,442 --> 00:36:57,221
Are you writing the draft for the Lieying?

511
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:00,162
I remember you said that someone from their internal team said that

512
00:37:00,272 --> 00:37:02,122
Yunchuang wanted to invest in them.

513
00:37:02,281 --> 00:37:04,282
Yeah, someone from their PR team told me.

514
00:37:04,385 --> 00:37:05,485
What's up?

515
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,010
Nothing.

516
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:11,891
(That's strange.)

517
00:37:12,002 --> 00:37:13,882
(Yunchuang wouldn't invest in two companies)

518
00:37:13,962 --> 00:37:16,169
in the same field at the same time.

519
00:37:19,633 --> 00:37:21,044
I'm off work now.

520
00:37:21,125 --> 00:37:23,042
It's the weekend tomorrow.

521
00:37:23,178 --> 00:37:24,653
If you can't handle Shi Yan...

522
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,202
If I can't handle him,

523
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,017
I'll wait for him at Mingyu.

524
00:37:33,842 --> 00:37:37,522
(Miss Zheng, Mr. Shi is free tomorrow afternoon from 1pm to 3pm.)

525
00:37:37,706 --> 00:37:39,240
(Is it convenient for you to come over?)

526
00:37:39,321 --> 00:37:40,962
(It's convenient. See you tomorrow.)

527
00:37:41,042 --> 00:37:42,622
(Thanks, Mr. Chen.)

528
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,190
Tomorrow 1pm.

529
00:37:51,241 --> 00:37:53,482
Congratulations. You finally settled Shi Yan.

530
00:37:53,624 --> 00:37:55,835
After you finish the interview, let's celebrate properly.

531
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,470
No problem. I'll go tell the editor.

532
00:37:57,551 --> 00:37:58,591
Okay, I'll leave first.

533
00:37:58,672 --> 00:37:59,854
- Bye.   - Bye.

534
00:38:40,945 --> 00:38:42,000
(That one.)

535
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,442
(That black tight dress is fine.)

536
00:38:44,666 --> 00:38:48,122
At least it can show your curvy figure.

537
00:38:48,315 --> 00:38:49,435
(This one?)

538
00:38:49,562 --> 00:38:50,681
(Is it really suitable?)

539
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:53,590
If I wear this, it's not convenient to take the laptop and stuff.

540
00:38:53,671 --> 00:38:55,080
And, it's not comfortable for the interview.

541
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,776
You were mind-controlled by that dirtbag, Yue Xing Zhou.

542
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,082
Did you know that?

543
00:38:59,402 --> 00:39:02,802
(He always tells you that the outer beauty of a girl isn't important;)

544
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:04,561
(inner beauty is the most important.)

545
00:39:04,641 --> 00:39:07,562
He makes you always wear the color of widowhood.

546
00:39:08,153 --> 00:39:11,162
(I think he just knows he simply isn't good enough for you.)

547
00:39:11,321 --> 00:39:13,402
(So, he's been saying these to you all day.)

548
00:39:13,482 --> 00:39:15,802
Why mention this?

549
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,622
Fine. I won't say anymore.

550
00:39:20,577 --> 00:39:24,362
Actually, an interview is the same as when we're on camera.

551
00:39:24,546 --> 00:39:27,307
(If you were sitting in front of him and you weren't attractive, )

552
00:39:27,442 --> 00:39:28,914
(he wouldn't even want to look at you.)

553
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,319
(He wouldn't accept your interview.)

554
00:39:30,414 --> 00:39:31,514
(What do we do?)

555
00:39:32,677 --> 00:39:34,602
It kind of makes sense.

556
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:36,882
Career and beauty

557
00:39:37,402 --> 00:39:39,163
are twin sisters.

558
00:39:39,284 --> 00:39:41,642
So, you have to listen to me, okay?

559
00:39:42,659 --> 00:39:44,739
When you go to see Shi Yan tomorrow,

560
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,202
you have to dress properly and elegantly

561
00:39:47,308 --> 00:39:48,842
but still be charming.

562
00:39:49,777 --> 00:39:52,057
This way, his gaze and attention

563
00:39:52,161 --> 00:39:55,122
will all be on you and won't move away.

564
00:39:55,234 --> 00:40:00,324
(Then, you'll have the chance to talk to him about life or ideals.)

565
00:40:02,843 --> 00:40:04,601
Zheng Shu Yi.

566
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,262
You troublemaker.

567
00:40:06,379 --> 00:40:08,179
I just wanted him to see you.

568
00:40:08,338 --> 00:40:09,958
Look at you.

569
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:13,522
It's not to make him cannot carry on the interview.

570
00:40:16,818 --> 00:40:18,779
You don't have to be so exaggerated.

571
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:20,490
(Don't believe me? Try it.)

572
00:40:20,882 --> 00:40:21,882
Trust me.

573
00:40:21,962 --> 00:40:24,629
Even if Shi Yan is excellent, he's still a man.

574
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:27,078
There's no way he can resist this.

575
00:40:29,362 --> 00:40:31,741
I understand. I got it.

576
00:40:32,106 --> 00:40:33,120
I still have work to do.

577
00:40:33,201 --> 00:40:34,652
I'm hanging up now.

578
00:40:59,341 --> 00:41:03,122
(Mr. Shi, the interview tomorrow is scheduled from 1pm to 3pm.)
