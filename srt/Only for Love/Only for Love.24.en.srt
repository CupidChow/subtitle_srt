00:01:30,962 --> 00:01:36,042
(Only For Love)

2
00:01:36,123 --> 00:01:39,042
(Episode 24)

3
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,922
(Back in college, he and I had a pretty good relationship...)

4
00:01:43,003 --> 00:01:44,589
It's fine. You can invite him.

5
00:01:44,919 --> 00:01:46,282
What's the big deal?

6
00:01:46,515 --> 00:01:48,595
It's between us two. It shouldn't affect you.

7
00:01:48,938 --> 00:01:50,067
(I know.)

8
00:01:50,421 --> 00:01:52,113
(I called him in the morning.)

9
00:01:52,215 --> 00:01:54,760
(But his current girlfriend seems to be there too, )

10
00:01:54,926 --> 00:01:56,834
(saying they are coming together to attend the wedding.)

11
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:58,602
(That's why I wanted to check with you.)

12
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,940
It's okay, I don't mind.

13
00:02:02,162 --> 00:02:04,522
(That's good. Keep in touch.)

14
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:05,846
Okay.

15
00:02:10,402 --> 00:02:13,803
(If I attend the wedding alone on the fourth day of Chinese New Year, )

16
00:02:13,904 --> 00:02:17,003
(while Yue Xing Zhou appears sweetly with Qin Le Zhi, )

17
00:02:17,122 --> 00:02:19,492
(I might die from overwhelming anger.)

18
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,391
(But Shi Yan...)

19
00:02:31,856 --> 00:02:35,116
This concludes today's content. Thank you all for coming.

20
00:02:58,401 --> 00:02:59,602
Qin Shi Yue.

21
00:03:00,362 --> 00:03:01,623
Yu You.

22
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,010
You're taking notes?

23
00:03:04,787 --> 00:03:06,918
Shu Yi asked me to prepare a summary.

24
00:03:09,032 --> 00:03:12,444
But there are a lot of things I don't understand.

25
00:03:20,954 --> 00:03:22,354
As a matter of fact...

26
00:03:23,592 --> 00:03:24,614
I...

27
00:03:24,695 --> 00:03:26,095
What?

28
00:03:27,321 --> 00:03:30,971
I think you don't need to focus on technical terms and concepts.

29
00:03:31,497 --> 00:03:33,218
Since you're doing financial content,

30
00:03:33,328 --> 00:03:36,217
the main thing is to grasp the trends and dynamics of the chip industry.

31
00:03:36,559 --> 00:03:40,962
You can mark some frequently mentioned terms and look them up later.

32
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:44,767
Yu You, you're so awesome.

33
00:03:44,848 --> 00:03:46,448
Now that you mention it, I get it right away.

34
00:03:52,046 --> 00:03:53,454
Guan Ji is not with you?

35
00:03:53,526 --> 00:03:55,120
He had something to attend to and left early.

36
00:03:55,453 --> 00:03:58,222
He's been preoccupied lately. I wonder what he's busy with.

37
00:04:00,001 --> 00:04:02,085
If there's nothing else, I'll get going now.

38
00:04:09,601 --> 00:04:12,491
What? I have to wait for 40 minutes?

39
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,322
Qin Shi Yue.

40
00:04:17,486 --> 00:04:18,886
Are you not leaving?

41
00:04:22,046 --> 00:04:23,245
I'm leaving!

42
00:04:23,344 --> 00:04:24,873
Wait for me!

43
00:04:24,954 --> 00:04:28,362
(Star Hotel)

44
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:43,402
It's so late. Is he asleep?

45
00:04:56,377 --> 00:04:57,777
(You're up?)

46
00:05:00,126 --> 00:05:01,526
(Just woke up.)

47
00:05:06,364 --> 00:05:07,585
(So?)

48
00:05:08,251 --> 00:05:09,902
(I can't sleep.)

49
00:05:14,538 --> 00:05:15,778
(And then?)

50
00:05:16,048 --> 00:05:17,982
(Is there anything I can do?)

51
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,933
(For example, ask Mr. Qiu to send me more materials.)

52
00:05:25,118 --> 00:05:27,638
(It's so late, why are you bothering him?)

53
00:05:28,646 --> 00:05:30,207
(Okay, got it.)

54
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,482
(Bye.)

55
00:05:42,703 --> 00:05:44,042
(Get dressed.)

56
00:05:45,752 --> 00:05:46,911
(Let's go out.)

57
00:05:46,998 --> 00:05:48,398
(Where to?)

58
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,840
(I'll take you to see a movie.)

59
00:06:42,567 --> 00:06:45,362
(You're going to watch a movie with your dad at this hour.)

60
00:06:45,927 --> 00:06:48,322
(This girl is really a mood dampener.)

61
00:06:54,856 --> 00:06:57,042
(My dad never has time for me.)

62
00:06:57,123 --> 00:07:00,479
(I envy you. Your dad really treasures you.)

63
00:07:10,133 --> 00:07:12,722
(He actually liked my post.)

64
00:07:21,051 --> 00:07:22,451
Uncle?

65
00:07:23,288 --> 00:07:24,819
Am I seeing things?

66
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:28,441
Uncle actually liked her post.

67
00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:33,279
Uncle worked with Shu Yi before.

68
00:07:33,417 --> 00:07:35,762
It's not surprising that he has her WeChat.

69
00:07:36,225 --> 00:07:38,362
But what's strange is that

70
00:07:38,534 --> 00:07:41,682
Uncle liked a post late at night.

71
00:07:42,006 --> 00:07:44,537
It doesn't conform to his usual behavioral logic.

72
00:07:49,148 --> 00:07:52,242
Could Uncle be secretly in love with Shu Yi?

73
00:07:59,726 --> 00:08:02,016
Forget it, isn't it good to be alive?

74
00:08:04,829 --> 00:08:06,802
Learn from your past lesson.

75
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:12,962
Is Shu Yi watching a movie with Yu You?

76
00:08:16,885 --> 00:08:20,175
Instead of guessing, why not directly find out the truth?

77
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,330
If she's not with Yu You

78
00:08:42,603 --> 00:08:44,802
and I knock on his door at this late hour,

79
00:08:45,881 --> 00:08:47,962
he will probably hate me.

80
00:09:03,163 --> 00:09:04,363
Hello.

81
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:06,082
(Hello, this is the front desk.)

82
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:07,602
Is there anything wrong?

83
00:09:07,962 --> 00:09:11,582
(We saw someone lingering outside your door in the surveillance, )

84
00:09:11,974 --> 00:09:14,257
(so we wanted to remind you to lock your door before sleeping.)

85
00:09:14,338 --> 00:09:16,882
(In case of an emergency, please contact us or call the police directly.)

86
00:09:16,963 --> 00:09:18,363
Okay, thank you.

87
00:09:36,078 --> 00:09:37,478
Qin Shi Yue?

88
00:09:59,055 --> 00:10:01,210
The front desk called to inform me that someone was

89
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,904
suspiciously lingering outside my door.

90
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:04,439
I thought it was someone else.

91
00:10:04,726 --> 00:10:05,886
I didn't expect it to be you.

92
00:10:06,012 --> 00:10:07,731
Why aren't you staying in your room at this hour?

93
00:10:07,812 --> 00:10:09,263
What are you doing outside my door?

94
00:10:10,434 --> 00:10:11,754
I have something to do.

95
00:10:11,859 --> 00:10:13,259
Don't bother.

96
00:10:14,094 --> 00:10:15,744
I don't care to bother you.

97
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:17,676
All right, go back to your room quickly.

98
00:10:17,803 --> 00:10:19,042
Don't cause trouble.

99
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,851
Who caused trouble?

100
00:10:21,906 --> 00:10:23,322
But you...

101
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,198
You dressed like this in the middle of the night.

102
00:10:25,342 --> 00:10:27,522
Where are you going? What are you doing?

103
00:10:28,637 --> 00:10:30,736
I also have something to do. Don't bother.

104
00:10:32,001 --> 00:10:33,282
You're pacing at the door.

105
00:10:33,363 --> 00:10:35,694
I wonder if the receptionist notified Yu You.

106
00:10:35,838 --> 00:10:38,167
I don't even know if he's in his room.

107
00:10:39,404 --> 00:10:41,719
All right, go back to your room quickly. I'm leaving.

108
00:10:45,683 --> 00:10:46,922
Hurry back.

109
00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:51,819
Yu You.

110
00:10:51,946 --> 00:10:55,162
Are you watching a movie with Shu Yi?

111
00:11:08,724 --> 00:11:09,918
Who is it?

112
00:11:10,406 --> 00:11:11,602
Me.

113
00:11:21,172 --> 00:11:22,572
What are you doing here?

114
00:11:23,508 --> 00:11:25,042
Can we talk?

115
00:11:29,441 --> 00:11:31,082
Let's go.

116
00:11:31,445 --> 00:11:33,362
What a crappy movie.

117
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:39,229
(Doesn't he find it boring?)

118
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:43,117
(You deceived my feelings!)

119
00:11:43,238 --> 00:11:45,460
(Yet, you want me to pretend that all the hurt doesn't exist)

120
00:11:45,596 --> 00:11:47,128
(and continue to be with you?)

121
00:11:50,465 --> 00:11:51,865
(That's impossible!)

122
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,890
(Shi Hai!)

123
00:11:57,418 --> 00:12:01,298
(If Shi Yan knew the truth, would he react the same way?)

124
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,430
I feel like you've been avoiding me recently.

125
00:12:25,514 --> 00:12:26,687
You see.

126
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:28,513
Like now,

127
00:12:29,264 --> 00:12:30,833
you're avoiding my gaze.

128
00:12:34,676 --> 00:12:37,166
Mr. Guan, I didn't expect you to care about these details.

129
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,839
I don't care about the details.

130
00:12:40,138 --> 00:12:41,538
I care about you.

131
00:12:53,743 --> 00:12:56,833
Mr. Guan, your sweet words just flow effortlessly.

132
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,531
I have to learn from you.

133
00:13:02,033 --> 00:13:03,529
This is not some sweet talk,

134
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,141
nor is it acting.

135
00:13:05,401 --> 00:13:06,642
Shan Shan.

136
00:13:26,494 --> 00:13:28,722
You might not believe what I'm about to say next.

137
00:13:29,107 --> 00:13:31,399
But I mean every word I say.

138
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:33,237
For a long time,

139
00:13:33,372 --> 00:13:38,213
I lack experience maintaining a long-term, stable relationship.

140
00:13:39,058 --> 00:13:40,562
And I lack confidence.

141
00:13:41,948 --> 00:13:44,997
So, when I started having feelings for you, I couldn't promise more.

142
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:48,642
But when I saw you avoiding me,

143
00:13:50,508 --> 00:13:52,588
I realized I really care about you.

144
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:56,299
I'm also seriously thinking about our relationship.

145
00:13:57,268 --> 00:13:58,668
Of course,

146
00:13:59,696 --> 00:14:01,096
it'll take some time.

147
00:14:03,098 --> 00:14:04,708
But no matter what,

148
00:14:05,296 --> 00:14:07,146
please stop avoiding me.

149
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:08,922
Okay?

150
00:14:20,969 --> 00:14:22,242
I understand.

151
00:14:24,315 --> 00:14:26,126
I won't avoid you anymore.

152
00:14:27,007 --> 00:14:28,938
But as for the rest,

153
00:14:30,106 --> 00:14:31,916
I also need time to think about it.

154
00:14:35,001 --> 00:14:36,401
Let's figure it out together.

155
00:14:50,758 --> 00:14:52,368
Do you think it was good?

156
00:14:53,045 --> 00:14:54,202
What?

157
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,202
Today's movie.

158
00:14:57,202 --> 00:14:58,402
Not bad.

159
00:15:00,842 --> 00:15:02,242
What do you think?

160
00:15:02,691 --> 00:15:03,692
Me?

161
00:15:03,773 --> 00:15:05,173
I think it's okay too.

162
00:15:07,438 --> 00:15:09,367
I think it's quite good.

163
00:15:10,158 --> 00:15:13,518
The way the female lead leaned on the male lead at the end was beautiful.

164
00:15:13,601 --> 00:15:15,562
And those two actors really match each other well.

165
00:15:15,643 --> 00:15:17,856
Watching them made me believe in love again. It's so sweet.

166
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,239
That scene was the male lead's imagination.

167
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,731
The female lead died,

168
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,371
and the male lead committed suicide.

169
00:15:28,648 --> 00:15:29,729
Yes.

170
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:31,295
That's what happened.

171
00:15:32,334 --> 00:15:34,482
But it's also a kind of happy ending, isn't it?

172
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:35,823
They resolved misunderstandings,

173
00:15:35,904 --> 00:15:38,322
loved each other until the end, and were loyal to each other even in death.

174
00:15:38,403 --> 00:15:39,803
Isn't that love?

175
00:15:42,113 --> 00:15:44,122
Is this really the movie you watched?

176
00:15:48,601 --> 00:15:50,651
(Why did both the male and female leads die?)

177
00:15:50,787 --> 00:15:52,750
(Isn't this a sweet romance movie?)

178
00:15:52,925 --> 00:15:55,404
(Didn't they promote it with the gimmick of mutual redemption?)

179
00:15:55,618 --> 00:15:57,271
(No wonder all the audience left.)

180
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,072
(It's a scam.)

181
00:16:02,443 --> 00:16:05,122
(Star Hotel)

182
00:16:26,249 --> 00:16:27,482
Shu Yi.

183
00:16:49,693 --> 00:16:51,242
You two...

184
00:16:51,656 --> 00:16:53,305
I bumped into Mr. Guan.

185
00:16:55,249 --> 00:16:57,379
I also bumped into Mr. Shi.

186
00:16:59,847 --> 00:17:02,298
What a coincidence. The four of us met again by chance.

187
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:09,482
This is not a coincidence.

188
00:17:09,563 --> 00:17:12,694
There's only one elevator, of course we'll run into each other.

189
00:17:13,795 --> 00:17:14,977
Right.

190
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,362
That's also a coincidence.

191
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:24,118
I was on my way back after having supper,

192
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:26,125
and I ran into Miss Bi.

193
00:17:33,238 --> 00:17:34,893
You dressed up to have supper alone?

194
00:17:35,756 --> 00:17:38,029
Yes. I wanted to ask you out.

195
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:40,030
I didn't expect you to go out alone at midnight either.

196
00:17:46,146 --> 00:17:48,202
- I...   - I understand.

197
00:17:48,482 --> 00:17:50,642
It's getting late. Let's go upstairs.

198
00:17:58,537 --> 00:18:00,959
(Oh no, it's that intimidating gaze again.)

199
00:18:01,089 --> 00:18:03,260
(Is Shi Yan angry?)

200
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,082
Qin Shi Yue.

201
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:19,610
This is the time for you to be brave and decisive.

202
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:44,722
(There's a new movie out recently.)

203
00:18:44,803 --> 00:18:47,804
(How about we try our luck and watch it together?)

204
00:19:02,561 --> 00:19:04,360
This movie has some controversy.

205
00:19:04,456 --> 00:19:06,616
We can discuss it in person after watching it.

206
00:19:07,467 --> 00:19:10,037
I've already compiled today's meeting records.

207
00:19:10,118 --> 00:19:12,837
It's essential to switch gears after the meeting.

208
00:19:12,982 --> 00:19:16,402
Only then can we absorb new information and knowledge tomorrow.

209
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:21,650
Two people from completely different worlds unexpectedly came together.

210
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:24,840
A love that happens within 24 hours.

211
00:19:25,005 --> 00:19:27,522
Short yet eternal.

212
00:19:28,496 --> 00:19:29,987
(It's a little romantic.)

213
00:19:38,132 --> 00:19:40,381
I've covered all the points.

214
00:19:40,719 --> 00:19:44,730
Yu You is an artistic person. He won't reject me upfront.

215
00:19:47,693 --> 00:19:49,383
(The schedule is tight tomorrow.)

216
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,761
(Rest early.)

217
00:19:50,872 --> 00:19:52,122
(Good night.)

218
00:20:07,782 --> 00:20:09,753
(I also bumped into Mr. Shi.)

219
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,691
What a coincidence. The four of us met again by chance.

220
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:18,438
(Zheng Shu Yi.)

221
00:20:18,857 --> 00:20:22,427
(Do you really not want others to know about our relationship?)

222
00:20:26,968 --> 00:20:30,098
This is clearly the perfect ending I mentioned.

223
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,562
What's wrong with Shi Yan?

224
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,760
Was he really watching the movie?

225
00:20:38,239 --> 00:20:39,921
(Why did you lie to me?)

226
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:43,688
(What did I lie to you about?)

227
00:20:46,061 --> 00:20:48,671
(The ending of that movie is not like that.)

228
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:53,160
(Then why weren't you watching the movie properly?)

229
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,602
(Because I was looking at you.)

230
00:20:57,664 --> 00:21:00,274
(With you by my side, I couldn't focus on the movie.)

231
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,640
None of your business.

232
00:21:08,153 --> 00:21:09,525
(Tomorrow at nine in the morning, )

233
00:21:09,654 --> 00:21:12,042
(there's a summit forum on nanochip technology.)

234
00:21:12,281 --> 00:21:13,681
(Let's go there together.)

235
00:21:20,771 --> 00:21:21,940
(You were right today.)

236
00:21:22,021 --> 00:21:24,360
(I should focus on industry trends.)

237
00:21:24,529 --> 00:21:26,680
(So, I plan to visit the corporate exhibition hall.)

238
00:21:26,775 --> 00:21:29,168
(Maybe I'll encounter my next fate.)

239
00:21:31,343 --> 00:21:32,583
Logical and convincing.

240
00:21:32,664 --> 00:21:34,393
Shi Yan shouldn't be upset.

241
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,568
What I mean is my fate in encountering interview subjects,

242
00:21:45,987 --> 00:21:48,397
the kind worth writing about.

243
00:21:51,122 --> 00:21:54,291
Work requires effort, not just relying on fate.

244
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,369
He's jealous.

245
00:21:59,457 --> 00:22:01,227
But I like it when you're a bit jealous.

246
00:22:02,361 --> 00:22:05,130
(I like sour and sweet, this is the real me.)

247
00:22:27,361 --> 00:22:28,771
Hold this for me, thanks.

248
00:22:35,724 --> 00:22:39,359
Chenxing's material has strong heat resistance, it's very stable.

249
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:42,640
It provides a good solution for contact resistance, migration degradation,

250
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,561
and reliability reduction caused by the reduction of process dimensions.

251
00:22:48,042 --> 00:22:49,492
Mr. Yi, what a coincidence.

252
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,879
It's not a coincidence.

253
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:53,910
I saw you over there, and I specifically came here to see you.

254
00:22:58,417 --> 00:22:59,817
How do you feel?

255
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,573
Thank you for your concern. I'm fine now.

256
00:23:03,271 --> 00:23:05,082
You missed a forum yesterday.

257
00:23:05,171 --> 00:23:06,741
I can explain it to you.

258
00:23:15,349 --> 00:23:16,999
(Contents of yesterday's forum.)

259
00:23:20,672 --> 00:23:22,072
(Thanks.)

260
00:23:25,309 --> 00:23:27,762
Thank you, Mr. Yi. My friend already sorted it out for me.

261
00:23:29,477 --> 00:23:31,483
Shi Yan is ahead of me.

262
00:23:35,355 --> 00:23:37,116
Let's go to the forum together later.

263
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,740
Some technical content is too profound for me.

264
00:23:42,863 --> 00:23:46,112
I'd better stay in the exhibition hall to collect some materials.

265
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:49,150
If you have any questions, I can answer them for you.

266
00:23:49,841 --> 00:23:53,001
I also know a bit about Chenxing Microelectronics.

267
00:23:53,104 --> 00:23:54,504
We can discuss it together.

268
00:23:58,448 --> 00:23:59,769
In the forum later,

269
00:23:59,881 --> 00:24:02,521
many technology experts in the nanochip industry

270
00:24:02,601 --> 00:24:04,570
will explain the trends in technological development.

271
00:24:04,667 --> 00:24:05,957
Some industry pioneers

272
00:24:06,038 --> 00:24:08,810
will discuss whether the time node of 2027 can be advanced.

273
00:24:10,278 --> 00:24:11,837
You can accumulate more materials.

274
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,250
If you want to ask for advice in the future, you know who to find.

275
00:24:15,344 --> 00:24:16,744
The most important thing is that

276
00:24:17,143 --> 00:24:18,912
I'm also invited to speak later.

277
00:24:22,732 --> 00:24:23,779
It's about to start.

278
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:26,260
The timing is just right for us to walk over now.

279
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:39,620
Mr. Yi is indeed young and promising, and also very humorous.

280
00:24:39,701 --> 00:24:41,886
Today, besides being lucky enough to invite

281
00:24:41,967 --> 00:24:44,748
several technical experts in the industry to share their experiences,

282
00:24:44,831 --> 00:24:47,153
we're also honored to have the founder of Mingyu Yunchuang,

283
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,202
who is very optimistic about the chip industry,

284
00:24:49,283 --> 00:24:52,522
Shi Yan, here to talk with us.

285
00:24:52,663 --> 00:24:54,063
Welcome, Mr. Shi.

286
00:25:08,161 --> 00:25:09,321
Hello, everyone.

287
00:25:09,401 --> 00:25:13,081
Today, we have technical experts and dark horses in the industry present.

288
00:25:13,162 --> 00:25:14,267
And me...

289
00:25:14,521 --> 00:25:17,126
Actually, I'm a caretaker.

290
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,576
Everyone here today is familiar with each other.

291
00:25:22,704 --> 00:25:25,800
Bruce, the former head of the R&D center at Le'an Technology,

292
00:25:25,881 --> 00:25:28,082
is now the CTO of Dark Horse Technology.

293
00:25:28,217 --> 00:25:29,682
I wonder how Mr. Yi and Mr. Shi

294
00:25:29,763 --> 00:25:33,002
view the competition between Le'an and Dark Horse.

295
00:25:39,904 --> 00:25:41,353
What's my view?

296
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,640
Isn't it obvious enough?

297
00:25:44,398 --> 00:25:47,600
Mr. Shi and I share similar views.

298
00:25:49,598 --> 00:25:53,400
Le'an and Dark Horse are dedicated to the development of domestic chips.

299
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:56,817
Even if there's competition, it's a fair competition.

300
00:25:57,138 --> 00:26:00,839
Bruce chose both Le'an and Dark Horse one after the other.

301
00:26:00,951 --> 00:26:03,041
It proves the strength of both companies.

302
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:05,282
The technology and patriotic spirit of Le'an

303
00:26:05,402 --> 00:26:07,042
align with Yunchuang's ideology.

304
00:26:07,161 --> 00:26:10,731
Therefore, Yunchuang is very honored to work hand in hand with Le'an.

305
00:26:11,099 --> 00:26:14,400
Every technology is like a marathon.

306
00:26:14,521 --> 00:26:17,920
Being temporarily ahead or behind is not important.

307
00:26:18,008 --> 00:26:21,722
What matters is sticking to the original intention until the end.

308
00:26:31,112 --> 00:26:34,032
What if Dark Horse achieves a breakthrough first?

309
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,599
The R&D of mmWave chips

310
00:26:37,756 --> 00:26:39,839
not only involves corporate interests

311
00:26:40,013 --> 00:26:43,570
but also affects social development and changes in people's lifestyles.

312
00:26:43,951 --> 00:26:44,978
So,

313
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:48,250
regardless of whether the final leader is Le'an or Dark Horse,

314
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:51,442
it's beneficial to consumers.

315
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:55,306
If Dark Horse Technology does achieve a breakthrough first,

316
00:26:55,711 --> 00:26:58,481
Yunchuang will also be happy to witness the success.

317
00:26:59,639 --> 00:27:00,879
However,

318
00:27:01,037 --> 00:27:03,677
Yunchuang still has confidence in Le'an Technology.

319
00:27:03,927 --> 00:27:06,721
I also have confidence in the future of domestic chips.

320
00:27:06,879 --> 00:27:08,082
Thank you.

321
00:27:32,713 --> 00:27:33,762
Yu You.

322
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:38,282
Sorry.

323
00:27:43,373 --> 00:27:44,522
Are you okay?

324
00:27:45,275 --> 00:27:46,430
I'm okay.

325
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,411
Do you have any plans later?

326
00:27:50,978 --> 00:27:53,802
- Not at the moment.   - Then let's have lunch together.

327
00:27:56,256 --> 00:27:57,561
Just a working lunch.

328
00:27:57,641 --> 00:27:59,731
Eating won't delay us from continuing to work after.

329
00:28:01,364 --> 00:28:03,125
Okay, I'm hungry anyway.

330
00:28:03,206 --> 00:28:04,482
Let's go now.

331
00:28:23,623 --> 00:28:25,073
Are you done?

332
00:28:25,321 --> 00:28:26,721
What were you looking at?

333
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,882
I was reviewing your brilliant speech just now.

334
00:28:33,537 --> 00:28:35,227
Mr. Shi, you look exceptionally handsome today.

335
00:28:36,255 --> 00:28:37,655
Was I not handsome before?

336
00:28:39,183 --> 00:28:42,593
So, you care so much about media evaluations.

337
00:28:43,503 --> 00:28:44,903
Come on, let's go for lunch.

338
00:28:45,903 --> 00:28:47,162
Zheng Shu Yi.

339
00:28:52,268 --> 00:28:53,471
Mr. Shi.

340
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:55,260
You're very close with Shu Yi.

341
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,282
Indeed.

342
00:29:01,121 --> 00:29:03,640
- Mr. Shi is my...   - Boyfriend.

343
00:29:11,747 --> 00:29:13,947
I should inform you about this then.

344
00:29:14,057 --> 00:29:15,747
I'm pursuing Shu Yi.

345
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,522
Yi Yang, stop joking.

346
00:29:23,927 --> 00:29:25,577
You think I'm kidding?

347
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:27,950
Shu Yi.

348
00:29:28,106 --> 00:29:29,506
I'm serious.

349
00:29:35,344 --> 00:29:37,235
Let's have a civilized competition.

350
00:29:37,518 --> 00:29:41,336
Whether in work or love, I will win beautifully.

351
00:29:48,471 --> 00:29:50,202
Mr. Yi, you're indeed young and confident.

352
00:29:50,795 --> 00:29:54,722
Because of Dark Horse, Le'an is now united and determined.

353
00:29:55,107 --> 00:29:58,274
Regardless of the outcome of this competition, I have already won.

354
00:30:04,217 --> 00:30:05,617
As for Shu Yi,

355
00:30:06,342 --> 00:30:09,382
she could never be a bargaining chip in our competition.

356
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,552
She's the only one I want.

357
00:30:13,069 --> 00:30:16,115
She also has the right to choose the person she likes.

358
00:30:21,527 --> 00:30:22,927
Let's go for lunch.

359
00:30:29,898 --> 00:30:31,467
Seems like it's getting more interesting.

360
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:34,802
Thanks.

361
00:30:38,056 --> 00:30:40,375
We finally managed to have this meal.

362
00:30:42,062 --> 00:30:44,912
Why are you so insistent on treating me to this meal?

363
00:30:46,618 --> 00:30:48,468
Isn't it obvious?

364
00:30:54,582 --> 00:30:56,712
You've helped me many times.

365
00:30:57,478 --> 00:30:58,967
Besides...

366
00:30:59,501 --> 00:31:03,301
Don't you think having a meal together can quickly bring two people closer?

367
00:31:05,484 --> 00:31:07,254
You're considered half of my student.

368
00:31:07,463 --> 00:31:10,550
If you encounter any difficulties, I will definitely help.

369
00:31:10,631 --> 00:31:12,400
So, don't think too much into it.

370
00:31:15,303 --> 00:31:16,703
But...

371
00:31:17,424 --> 00:31:20,353
It's the other half of me who always wants to eat with you.

372
00:31:26,658 --> 00:31:27,778
So...

373
00:31:27,954 --> 00:31:30,233
Can I treat you to dinner next time?

374
00:31:31,617 --> 00:31:32,669
No.

375
00:31:38,334 --> 00:31:39,734
Fine.

376
00:31:40,951 --> 00:31:42,442
Next time, it's your treat.

377
00:32:02,797 --> 00:32:04,197
What's the matter?

378
00:32:05,222 --> 00:32:06,979
Nothing, just happy.

379
00:32:08,237 --> 00:32:09,397
Understood.

380
00:32:09,478 --> 00:32:10,735
Then what?

381
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:13,009
Then...

382
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,761
There's nothing else.

383
00:32:18,805 --> 00:32:21,096
Can Chen Kang really save Le'an?

384
00:32:26,003 --> 00:32:27,122
Le'an

385
00:32:27,927 --> 00:32:29,327
will most probably lose.

386
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:30,953
Then you and Yunchuang...

387
00:32:31,034 --> 00:32:33,269
Yunchuang and I are also likely to fail in our investment.

388
00:32:36,238 --> 00:32:38,088
If I lose, I'll just start over.

389
00:32:38,406 --> 00:32:41,606
I've experienced times when rumors surrounded me, and I had to be cautious.

390
00:32:41,968 --> 00:32:44,539
Back then, I couldn't afford to lose, and I dared not lose.

391
00:32:47,085 --> 00:32:48,485
But now,

392
00:32:51,424 --> 00:32:52,824
I can afford to lose.

393
00:32:53,117 --> 00:32:55,642
Even if I lose, I can stand up again.

394
00:33:01,509 --> 00:33:02,909
You have me now.

395
00:33:03,517 --> 00:33:04,842
I'll always stay with you.

396
00:33:04,951 --> 00:33:07,512
Whether it's success or failure,

397
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:08,946
we'll face it together.

398
00:33:11,293 --> 00:33:12,584
Although I don't earn much,

399
00:33:12,665 --> 00:33:16,070
it's more than enough for me to live an ordinary life with you.

400
00:33:22,411 --> 00:33:23,491
Don't worry.

401
00:33:23,572 --> 00:33:26,252
No matter what happens, I won't lose the car you like.

402
00:33:26,503 --> 00:33:28,903
That was a gift from my dad when I started my business.

403
00:33:28,999 --> 00:33:30,399
I cherish it very much.

404
00:33:46,882 --> 00:33:48,282
Are you going back?

405
00:33:50,488 --> 00:33:51,888
I've gathered enough materials.

406
00:33:52,854 --> 00:33:55,402
Why didn't you tell me?

407
00:33:56,525 --> 00:33:57,564
Why?

408
00:33:57,675 --> 00:34:00,446
Do I need to report to you about my work?

409
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:02,530
Shan Shan, shall we go now?

410
00:34:02,703 --> 00:34:03,842
Let's go.

411
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:15,922
Guan Ji!

412
00:34:24,123 --> 00:34:25,282
Let's go.

413
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:31,099
What are you doing?

414
00:34:39,513 --> 00:34:41,403
(When are the holidays for your magazine?)

415
00:34:41,548 --> 00:34:43,587
(Let's see if we can go back together.)

416
00:34:43,668 --> 00:34:45,268
I'll check my schedule and let you know.

417
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:48,122
Bye.

418
00:34:52,264 --> 00:34:53,674
Do you have any plans for going home?

419
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:56,194
December 28th of the Lunar calendar.

420
00:34:59,084 --> 00:35:01,270
Shan Shan asked about the holidays for my magazine.

421
00:35:01,351 --> 00:35:02,761
She invited me to go home together.

422
00:35:07,059 --> 00:35:10,109
(We just got together and we have to be separated for such a long time.)

423
00:35:20,248 --> 00:35:22,562
I'm free that day. I'll send you home.

424
00:35:24,436 --> 00:35:26,766
I have a lot of things to bring home.

425
00:35:27,524 --> 00:35:28,924
They can fit.

426
00:35:29,318 --> 00:35:32,519
Yes, no problem. Miss Zheng, they can surely fit in the car.

427
00:35:38,355 --> 00:35:41,365
It's clearly written in this report.

428
00:35:41,929 --> 00:35:43,738
The scale of Zhanlan is larger,

429
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:48,962
while Juhe is just a newly established technology R&D team.

430
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,291
Choosing Juhe over Zhanlan

431
00:35:51,532 --> 00:35:54,386
is like losing the forest for the trees.

432
00:35:56,386 --> 00:36:00,075
Didn't Zhanlan start from scratch and gradually grow to its current scale?

433
00:36:02,459 --> 00:36:04,628
The battery industry relies heavily on technology.

434
00:36:04,804 --> 00:36:07,164
Therefore, the strength of the R&D team is particularly important.

435
00:36:07,245 --> 00:36:09,460
Juhe has a first-class R&D team.

436
00:36:10,435 --> 00:36:13,019
Everyone should notice the 11th page of our report.

437
00:36:15,105 --> 00:36:18,751
Juhe's R&D expenses have exceeded 20% of the total revenue.

438
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,207
From this point alone,

439
00:36:20,288 --> 00:36:23,282
we can see Juhe's determination in technological innovation.

440
00:36:24,289 --> 00:36:25,450
I don't see it that way.

441
00:36:25,576 --> 00:36:26,815
In my opinion,

442
00:36:26,896 --> 00:36:28,802
different companies have different strategies.

443
00:36:28,923 --> 00:36:31,403
However, there's a huge difference in the scale of the two companies.

444
00:36:31,537 --> 00:36:32,656
That's a fact.

445
00:36:32,749 --> 00:36:36,637
Although Zhanlan only allocates 5% of its revenue on R&D,

446
00:36:37,042 --> 00:36:39,922
it's still much more than Juhe's 20%.

447
00:36:40,024 --> 00:36:43,825
So, if we were to decide purely based on the percentage of R&D expenses,

448
00:36:44,761 --> 00:36:46,491
I think it's biased.

449
00:36:48,533 --> 00:36:50,202
Mr. Tian has a point.

450
00:36:50,793 --> 00:36:51,994
However,

451
00:36:52,113 --> 00:36:54,403
Zhanlan's R&D progress is slow

452
00:36:54,703 --> 00:36:56,362
and is far behind Juhe.

453
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:59,637
It's even showing a trend of falling behind other teams.

454
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:01,322
How long can they live off of their old achievements?

455
00:37:01,482 --> 00:37:04,601
And it's not just about short-term satisfaction

456
00:37:04,734 --> 00:37:08,305
but involves compromising a smaller benefit to protect a larger one.

457
00:37:08,754 --> 00:37:11,445
Juhe is the larger benefit I'm talking about.

458
00:37:14,457 --> 00:37:15,722
Chen Sheng.

459
00:37:16,274 --> 00:37:19,164
How many times do you have to charge your car on your way home?

460
00:37:19,495 --> 00:37:20,762
Three times.

461
00:37:20,976 --> 00:37:24,145
These three times are the space left for Juhe.

462
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:25,810
It's also the space left for us.

463
00:37:26,215 --> 00:37:28,295
Juhe is young and motivated,

464
00:37:28,419 --> 00:37:30,042
and the key is that the valuation is reasonable.

465
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:33,533
If we make the right bet, Yunchuang will definitely make a big profit.

466
00:37:48,922 --> 00:37:50,322
It's almost the New Year.

467
00:37:51,062 --> 00:37:52,382
Yes, Mr. Shi.

468
00:37:52,589 --> 00:37:55,682
Buy some New Year's goods and send them to Chen Kang and Le'an.

469
00:37:55,928 --> 00:37:56,976
Okay.

470
00:38:01,192 --> 00:38:03,719
Buy some New Year's goods that are for family too.

471
00:38:07,648 --> 00:38:08,882
Understood.

472
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,536
I've reviewed the summary of the chip conference.

473
00:38:13,617 --> 00:38:14,896
There's no issues.

474
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:17,722
I'll select a few key points, and you can follow up on them.

475
00:38:18,485 --> 00:38:21,293
Before the holiday, compile some information on Juhe's batteries

476
00:38:21,414 --> 00:38:22,867
and give them to me as soon as possible.

477
00:38:24,155 --> 00:38:27,155
The only deadline comparable to the final deadline is before the New Year.

478
00:38:28,235 --> 00:38:31,202
If you're willing, you can give it to me during the New Year.

479
00:38:32,596 --> 00:38:33,786
I can't do it.

480
00:38:33,907 --> 00:38:35,660
I'll give it to you before the New Year, Shu Yi.

481
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,082
Shu Yi, it's time for the meeting.

482
00:38:39,351 --> 00:38:40,562
Thanks.

483
00:38:44,104 --> 00:38:45,994
How long has she been in this state?

484
00:38:47,169 --> 00:38:48,482
Quite long.

485
00:38:48,603 --> 00:38:50,973
It's been so long that Shu Yi has gotten used to it.

486
00:38:53,396 --> 00:38:55,751
She's a fox. She'll show her tail sooner or later.

487
00:38:56,624 --> 00:38:58,073
She can't deceive us for long.

488
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:14,420
(Let's have dinner tonight?)

489
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,253
(She's a fox. She'll show her tail sooner or later.)

490
00:39:48,008 --> 00:39:49,128
Shu Yi, I'm getting off work.

491
00:39:49,209 --> 00:39:50,240
Bye.

492
00:39:56,854 --> 00:39:58,682
Are you not leaving yet?

493
00:39:58,791 --> 00:40:00,953
Don't work too hard before the holiday.

494
00:40:01,701 --> 00:40:03,621
I'll finish my work and then leave.

495
00:40:03,702 --> 00:40:04,881
Go first.

496
00:40:05,795 --> 00:40:07,282
Perfect timing, my cab has arrived.

497
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:08,762
I'll leave now. See you tomorrow.

498
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,962
Bye.

499
00:40:43,575 --> 00:40:45,282
(I was in a meeting just now.)

500
00:40:45,347 --> 00:40:47,522
(Maybe another day. I'm working overtime today.)

501
00:40:47,566 --> 00:40:49,375
(I don't know until what time I'll be working.)

502
00:40:53,887 --> 00:40:55,042
Mr. Shi.

503
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:56,786
Wait a little longer.

504
00:41:16,327 --> 00:41:18,607
(Babe, are you off work?)

505
00:41:18,688 --> 00:41:19,934
No.

506
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:22,271
Why are you in a bad mood?

507
00:41:22,775 --> 00:41:24,762
(Nothing, I'm working overtime.)

508
00:41:24,953 --> 00:41:26,843
(You're such a workaholic.)

509
00:41:26,949 --> 00:41:29,118
How about it? Have you bought the things to bring home?

510
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:30,679
No.

511
00:41:30,775 --> 00:41:32,082
(I knew it.)

512
00:41:32,303 --> 00:41:34,753
(Do you know why I called you?)

513
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:38,729
What's wrong with you?

514
00:41:41,658 --> 00:41:42,899
Shan Shan.

515
00:41:43,096 --> 00:41:46,602
Shi Yan was supposed to have dinner with me tonight.

516
00:41:47,214 --> 00:41:49,682
Isn't that great?

517
00:41:50,128 --> 00:41:51,978
(I'm a little afraid.)

518
00:41:52,364 --> 00:41:53,814
What are you afraid of?

519
00:41:55,291 --> 00:41:57,302
I'm afraid he'll be nice to me,

520
00:41:57,552 --> 00:41:59,242
afraid he'll find out,

521
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,469
afraid of hurting his feelings.

522
00:42:02,558 --> 00:42:04,647
So you want to tell him, right?

523
00:42:08,432 --> 00:42:10,442
What are you thinking?

524
00:42:10,563 --> 00:42:13,243
If you're so afraid, it's even more inappropriate to say it now.

525
00:42:13,651 --> 00:42:16,141
Your relationship is not stable yet.

526
00:42:16,332 --> 00:42:18,772
When we met in the lobby last time,

527
00:42:18,853 --> 00:42:21,464
do you think I didn't see you pull your hand away?

528
00:42:21,671 --> 00:42:23,084
(Because even you don't have confidence)

529
00:42:23,174 --> 00:42:24,573
(that he'll believe your explanation)

530
00:42:24,654 --> 00:42:26,631
and forgive your initial motives.

531
00:42:26,727 --> 00:42:27,727
Am I right?

532
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:30,412
Even if I don't say it,

533
00:42:30,493 --> 00:42:33,642
he will find out from his niece sooner or later.

534
00:42:33,958 --> 00:42:36,112
- By that time...   - (By that time...)

535
00:42:36,249 --> 00:42:38,362
(By that time, he'd have fallen in love with you.)

536
00:42:38,443 --> 00:42:39,524
(He'd say, )

537
00:42:39,605 --> 00:42:41,844
"It's okay, I forgive you".

538
00:42:41,925 --> 00:42:44,616
And say that "The most important thing is that we're together".

539
00:42:45,028 --> 00:42:46,428
Really?

540
00:42:46,995 --> 00:42:48,708
(For someone like Shi Yan, )

541
00:42:48,788 --> 00:42:50,725
love is not a necessity.

542
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,935
When your relationship is still unstable,

543
00:42:53,016 --> 00:42:57,449
letting him know that you deceived him will only ruin your relationship.

544
00:42:58,344 --> 00:43:00,624
(Are you willing to lose him because of this?)

545
00:43:02,123 --> 00:43:03,202
All right.

546
00:43:03,283 --> 00:43:05,682
Just do more to strengthen your relationship.

547
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:07,562
Don't think about these things for now.

548
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,710
I'll try.
