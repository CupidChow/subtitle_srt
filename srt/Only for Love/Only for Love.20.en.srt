00:01:31,202 --> 00:01:36,081
(Only For Love)

2
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:38,962
(Episode 20)

3
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,800
I wish I didn't drive today.

4
00:01:52,883 --> 00:01:54,934
Then Yu You could have given me a ride home,

5
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,622
and we could have had some more time alone.

6
00:02:00,683 --> 00:02:03,253
Next time, I'll definitely remember not to drive when I meet him.

7
00:02:05,762 --> 00:02:08,053
I can't believe we're working on the weekend.

8
00:02:15,764 --> 00:02:16,883
But with you by my side,

9
00:02:16,963 --> 00:02:18,574
it's like a date no matter where we are.

10
00:02:20,297 --> 00:02:21,538
Are you cold?

11
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,042
Should we go to the car?

12
00:02:23,764 --> 00:02:24,812
No.

13
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,002
I can't hold you like this in the car.

14
00:02:27,204 --> 00:02:29,564
Your arms are the warmest place.

15
00:02:37,685 --> 00:02:39,643
How long did you wait for me today?

16
00:02:40,523 --> 00:02:41,882
Tell me.

17
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:43,479
Why did you suddenly come here?

18
00:02:44,563 --> 00:02:45,963
Zheng Shu Yi.

19
00:02:47,195 --> 00:02:49,686
Why do you have so many questions even now?

20
00:02:51,157 --> 00:02:52,686
Can't I know?

21
00:02:53,557 --> 00:02:55,324
I thought being a girlfriend

22
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,459
meant I could know your every move and thought.

23
00:02:58,563 --> 00:03:00,653
Isn't that a privilege of being a girlfriend?

24
00:03:02,884 --> 00:03:04,178
You can know.

25
00:03:05,003 --> 00:03:06,403
I...

26
00:03:15,177 --> 00:03:16,577
It's my mom.

27
00:03:17,355 --> 00:03:19,362
It's cold out here. You should answer it inside.

28
00:03:20,638 --> 00:03:21,652
Okay.

29
00:03:24,364 --> 00:03:27,284
(Yi, why did it take you so long to answer the phone?)

30
00:03:27,364 --> 00:03:28,762
(How was your day?)

31
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:30,579
I had a great day.

32
00:03:45,196 --> 00:03:46,282
Yi,

33
00:03:46,779 --> 00:03:49,802
I know that girls your age sometimes become infatuated

34
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,404
with online celebrities,

35
00:03:52,485 --> 00:03:54,204
seeing them as your husband,

36
00:03:54,285 --> 00:03:55,695
(spending money and efforts on them.)

37
00:03:56,029 --> 00:03:57,829
(In the end, they become so obsessed)

38
00:03:57,948 --> 00:04:00,242
(that they overlook the boys around them, )

39
00:04:00,523 --> 00:04:02,734
missing out on many potential relationships.

40
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:04,534
Isn't that such a pity?

41
00:04:05,366 --> 00:04:07,566
Yu You is a nice boy.

42
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,682
Spend more time with him and get to know him better,

43
00:04:09,763 --> 00:04:10,947
do you hear me?

44
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,762
I never said he wasn't good.

45
00:04:13,843 --> 00:04:15,243
Why are you so impatient?

46
00:04:15,884 --> 00:04:17,324
(I'm not impatient.)

47
00:04:17,483 --> 00:04:19,333
I'm just having a heart-to-heart with you

48
00:04:19,462 --> 00:04:22,512
to prevent you from having unrealistic thoughts.

49
00:04:24,004 --> 00:04:25,124
Mom, I have to go.

50
00:04:25,204 --> 00:04:26,283
I'm going to take a shower.

51
00:04:26,363 --> 00:04:27,471
(Hold on.)

52
00:04:27,552 --> 00:04:29,953
I just talked to Madam Chen.

53
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:32,002
She's very supportive of you two.

54
00:04:32,185 --> 00:04:35,156
You have to attend that exhibition this weekend together, got it?

55
00:04:36,664 --> 00:04:37,843
We'll see about that.

56
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,345
I'm going to remove my makeup.

57
00:05:01,804 --> 00:05:03,574
My make-up is so light today.

58
00:05:37,244 --> 00:05:40,443
Professor Yu, I've booked the tickets for the art exhibition.

59
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,083
(Thank you. How much are the tickets?)

60
00:05:46,176 --> 00:05:47,576
(I'll transfer the money to you.)

61
00:05:49,397 --> 00:05:52,767
Even his punctuation looks so polite.

62
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:59,533
- Uncle.   - You're home, Yue.

63
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,941
Uncle, did something good happen today?

64
00:06:12,283 --> 00:06:13,362
Anything exciting?

65
00:06:13,464 --> 00:06:14,864
Share it with me now!

66
00:06:16,594 --> 00:06:18,204
Kid, don't be nosy.

67
00:06:21,709 --> 00:06:22,949
Uncle,

68
00:06:23,124 --> 00:06:24,733
you have lipstick stains on your lips.

69
00:06:35,957 --> 00:06:37,557
It's late. Go to bed early.

70
00:06:37,637 --> 00:06:39,246
Or you will have dark panda eyes.

71
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:47,848
I teased him and he still jokes with me.

72
00:06:49,928 --> 00:06:52,482
What's going on with him?

73
00:07:03,043 --> 00:07:04,443
Morning, Yue.

74
00:07:16,244 --> 00:07:17,644
Morning, Yue.

75
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,842
(Did something good really happen yesterday?)

76
00:07:21,923 --> 00:07:24,082
(Why is everyone in such good mood?)

77
00:07:33,523 --> 00:07:35,614
Hello, this is the blanket you asked for.

78
00:07:41,973 --> 00:07:44,282
(Financial Introduce, written by Zheng Shu Yi)

79
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:08,842
Morning.

80
00:08:09,001 --> 00:08:10,322
Morning.

81
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:16,958
Nan Nan, what happened to you?

82
00:08:19,227 --> 00:08:21,904
Don't even get me started. Our house had a leak last night.

83
00:08:21,985 --> 00:08:23,385
I could not get any sleep all night.

84
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,188
Is it fixed now?

85
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:28,931
It's been inspected. The place will need to be renovated.

86
00:08:30,412 --> 00:08:32,173
I have nowhere to stay now.

87
00:08:32,316 --> 00:08:34,686
After work, I have to go find a new place.

88
00:08:35,938 --> 00:08:38,122
I posted it on my Moments last night, didn't you see it?

89
00:08:39,304 --> 00:08:40,962
Last night...

90
00:08:41,084 --> 00:08:42,562
I didn't see it.

91
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,139
Did you put on eyeliner?

92
00:08:51,003 --> 00:08:52,803
I suddenly felt like putting on a little today.

93
00:08:52,883 --> 00:08:54,922
My eyeliner pencil is getting dry.

94
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,358
That's not it.

95
00:08:57,555 --> 00:08:58,715
What do you mean?

96
00:08:58,796 --> 00:08:59,996
Not just eyeliner,

97
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:03,562
you also applied blush and lipstick.

98
00:09:09,643 --> 00:09:11,414
Hello, Mr. Chen.

99
00:09:19,252 --> 00:09:22,003
The average age of Juhe's team is quite young, isn't it?

100
00:09:22,084 --> 00:09:24,042
And in terms of scale, it's just decent.

101
00:09:24,219 --> 00:09:27,259
Yu You, I think this report needs some revisions.

102
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,502
Otherwise, those uncles might say we're not taking it seriously again.

103
00:09:29,587 --> 00:09:31,282
Shi Yan, what do you think?

104
00:09:35,253 --> 00:09:36,653
Take a look at him.

105
00:09:37,564 --> 00:09:39,054
Is he smiling?

106
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:41,792
It's a bit scary.

107
00:09:43,222 --> 00:09:44,622
He seems

108
00:09:45,331 --> 00:09:47,181
to be in a good mood today.

109
00:09:50,265 --> 00:09:51,482
Why are you looking at me?

110
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:54,243
Have you finished reviewing the report? Is there anything to add?

111
00:09:56,102 --> 00:09:57,421
Just drop the act.

112
00:09:57,556 --> 00:09:59,596
Shouldn't you be sharing

113
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:01,469
what put you in such good mood?

114
00:10:02,883 --> 00:10:04,733
I've encountered a good thing, of course.

115
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:07,405
Juhe is young, energetic,

116
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,060
and ambitious in terms of technology.

117
00:10:09,164 --> 00:10:10,883
The management team has clear division of labor.

118
00:10:10,963 --> 00:10:12,363
I have high hopes for them.

119
00:10:12,963 --> 00:10:14,722
Plus, from this report,

120
00:10:14,805 --> 00:10:16,526
Juhe's valuation looks very reasonable.

121
00:10:16,732 --> 00:10:17,882
If we invest now,

122
00:10:17,963 --> 00:10:19,563
it's like we're getting a great bargain.

123
00:10:19,643 --> 00:10:21,684
Shouldn't I be happy about this?

124
00:10:22,483 --> 00:10:23,483
That's the only reason?

125
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:25,454
How's that possible?

126
00:10:26,324 --> 00:10:27,724
Do you believe him?

127
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,120
(Have you had lunch?)

128
00:10:53,828 --> 00:10:56,078
(I'm having a full-course meal.)

129
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:03,002
(My girlfriend doesn't seem to be eating well.)

130
00:11:05,588 --> 00:11:08,198
(Can my boyfriend help me with that then?)

131
00:11:18,964 --> 00:11:20,764
(Shu Yi, I'm a little busy tonight.)

132
00:11:20,905 --> 00:11:22,418
(I'll make it up to you over the weekend.)

133
00:11:24,963 --> 00:11:26,802
(Shu Yi, I'm a little busy tonight.)

134
00:11:26,929 --> 00:11:28,465
(I'll make it up to you over the weekend.)

135
00:11:33,532 --> 00:11:35,142
Okay, I'll be waiting.

136
00:11:40,092 --> 00:11:41,162
Shu Yi,

137
00:11:41,721 --> 00:11:44,563
are you texting Professor Yu?

138
00:11:45,145 --> 00:11:47,436
What you talking about? No, I'm not.

139
00:11:51,695 --> 00:11:52,740
Yue,

140
00:11:52,844 --> 00:11:54,844
I have to tell you something serious.

141
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:57,131
I only have admiration for Yu You as a friend,

142
00:11:57,328 --> 00:11:58,728
and nothing more.

143
00:12:03,572 --> 00:12:04,643
Shu Yi,

144
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,923
there's something serious I need to tell you too.

145
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:08,293
Go ahead.

146
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:11,820
I think the advice I gave you last time was not right.

147
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:14,492
You and Professor Yu are likes.

148
00:12:14,658 --> 00:12:16,362
- "Likes?"   - Yes.

149
00:12:16,808 --> 00:12:18,049
Have you ever heard of the saying

150
00:12:18,162 --> 00:12:20,443
"opposites attract, likes repel"?

151
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:22,010
Your personalities are too similar.

152
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,600
You don't complement each other. So, you're not right for each other.

153
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,145
What kind of man do you think suits me then?

154
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,138
That uncle you said.

155
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,844
- Do you really think so too?   - Absolutely.

156
00:12:35,924 --> 00:12:37,324
You and him complement each other

157
00:12:37,404 --> 00:12:40,238
in terms of personality, age, and profession.

158
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,802
You'd be a great match.

159
00:12:45,689 --> 00:12:47,301
Well, following your logic,

160
00:12:47,382 --> 00:12:49,592
you and Yu You seem to be a great match too.

161
00:12:50,735 --> 00:12:52,135
That's right.

162
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:54,444
Shu Yi, do you really think so too?

163
00:12:58,044 --> 00:12:59,084
Want some?

164
00:12:59,164 --> 00:13:00,564
No, thanks.

165
00:13:14,605 --> 00:13:16,005
I've made plans with someone.

166
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,572
Let's have dinner together, okay?

167
00:13:19,812 --> 00:13:21,212
I need to talk to you.

168
00:13:21,804 --> 00:13:23,204
Shan Shan.

169
00:13:24,628 --> 00:13:26,188
We'll be going then.

170
00:13:26,269 --> 00:13:27,522
Bye.

171
00:13:28,461 --> 00:13:29,861
Let's get in the car first.

172
00:13:53,694 --> 00:13:55,007
It's for you.

173
00:13:57,835 --> 00:13:59,235
Thank you.

174
00:14:12,524 --> 00:14:13,722
Miss Kong,

175
00:14:13,963 --> 00:14:15,683
my college classmate is a local resident.

176
00:14:15,764 --> 00:14:17,374
He happens to have a house for rent.

177
00:14:17,684 --> 00:14:19,602
It's very close to your magazine office.

178
00:14:19,843 --> 00:14:21,493
I saw your post on Moments

179
00:14:21,606 --> 00:14:22,922
and thought I'd ask you.

180
00:14:23,068 --> 00:14:25,558
That's great. You're doing me a great favor.

181
00:14:25,924 --> 00:14:28,002
And please stop calling me Miss Kong.

182
00:14:28,086 --> 00:14:30,255
It's too formal. I told you, call me Nan.

183
00:14:30,885 --> 00:14:32,082
Nan...

184
00:14:32,363 --> 00:14:33,763
Nan...

185
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,880
Or if you prefer, just call me Kong Nan.

186
00:14:36,032 --> 00:14:37,432
Kong Nan.

187
00:14:38,838 --> 00:14:39,964
Is this a new residential area?

188
00:14:40,044 --> 00:14:41,282
Is the rent expensive?

189
00:14:41,363 --> 00:14:42,482
I've asked him before coming.

190
00:14:42,627 --> 00:14:44,442
The rent is similar to your previous place.

191
00:14:44,523 --> 00:14:45,710
If you like the place,

192
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,563
I can talk to my friend and lower the rent for you.

193
00:14:47,643 --> 00:14:49,043
That's great.

194
00:14:53,516 --> 00:14:55,682
What do you think of the place, Miss Kong? Do you like it?

195
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,082
I love it.

196
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,944
It's just the rent...

197
00:14:59,402 --> 00:15:00,561
The rent is negotiable.

198
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,002
You don't know this, but Chen Sheng has been pestering me all day today.

199
00:15:03,145 --> 00:15:07,202
So, I thought I had got to help him out here.

200
00:15:22,157 --> 00:15:24,116
Thanks for today.

201
00:15:25,643 --> 00:15:27,454
Don't mention it.

202
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,189
Well, if there's nothing else,

203
00:15:33,635 --> 00:15:35,402
I'll head back now.

204
00:15:35,557 --> 00:15:36,722
Bye.

205
00:15:37,361 --> 00:15:38,682
Bye.

206
00:15:42,444 --> 00:15:43,844
Chen Sheng,

207
00:15:46,883 --> 00:15:48,283
just now...

208
00:15:48,363 --> 00:15:52,004
Miss Kong, please don't take my friend's words seriously.

209
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:54,454
He always liked to tease me when we were in college.

210
00:15:57,217 --> 00:15:58,762
So, does that mean

211
00:15:58,843 --> 00:16:00,453
you're not interested in me?

212
00:16:01,109 --> 00:16:02,682
No, I didn't mean that.

213
00:16:02,949 --> 00:16:06,446
What I mean is that I...

214
00:16:07,971 --> 00:16:10,491
Come on, you're a grown man. Just be straightforward.

215
00:16:10,571 --> 00:16:12,122
Are you interested in me or not?

216
00:16:12,234 --> 00:16:13,762
I'm a little interested in you.

217
00:16:14,185 --> 00:16:15,595
What does "a little" mean?

218
00:16:16,936 --> 00:16:18,814
I mean, I think you're great.

219
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,191
I just want to see if there might be a chance...

220
00:16:21,869 --> 00:16:23,149
A chance to what?

221
00:16:23,284 --> 00:16:24,684
A chance for us to go out.

222
00:16:28,243 --> 00:16:29,364
I'm just thinking about it.

223
00:16:29,444 --> 00:16:30,803
If you're not interested...

224
00:16:30,883 --> 00:16:32,863
Well, you really should think it through.

225
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,254
As you know, I'm five years older than you.

226
00:16:35,349 --> 00:16:37,628
By July this year, I'll be thirty.

227
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:40,320
My mom has been pushing for me to get married, and she's quite insistent.

228
00:16:40,646 --> 00:16:43,340
So, I really don't have time to just fool around with a younger guy.

229
00:16:45,293 --> 00:16:46,522
I understand.

230
00:16:52,504 --> 00:16:53,922
So,

231
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,060
if you want to pursue me,

232
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:57,802
you have to be serious.

233
00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:01,900
And consider about getting married in the future.

234
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,720
Don't waste your time,

235
00:17:03,819 --> 00:17:05,269
and don't waste mine.

236
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,920
Do you understand?

237
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:10,042
No problem!

238
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,640
I promise you.

239
00:17:14,386 --> 00:17:16,579
So, do you have plans later?

240
00:17:19,776 --> 00:17:21,306
Let's have dinner together then.

241
00:17:34,033 --> 00:17:35,433
(Have you had dinner?)

242
00:17:42,469 --> 00:17:45,122
(Shi Yan can be quite clingy.)

243
00:17:45,362 --> 00:17:47,883
(I'm having it. Now it's my turn to ask you.)

244
00:17:47,987 --> 00:17:49,387
(Have you had dinner?)

245
00:17:52,465 --> 00:17:53,762
(Not yet.)

246
00:18:01,443 --> 00:18:03,213
Mr. Shi, here's your takeout.

247
00:18:11,312 --> 00:18:13,042
(Have you received the takeout?)

248
00:18:23,662 --> 00:18:25,122
Why haven't you eaten yet?

249
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:27,602
(I'm waiting to have it together with you.)

250
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:29,382
(Check it out. Do you like it?)

251
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,202
Shu Yi,

252
00:18:51,316 --> 00:18:52,516
thank you.

253
00:18:52,597 --> 00:18:53,997
For what?

254
00:18:55,603 --> 00:18:58,094
If you really want to thank me, finish all the food.

255
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:01,902
(You know what? Forget it, don't overeat.)

256
00:19:02,538 --> 00:19:05,522
All right now. I'm hanging up. Eat your dinner. Bye.

257
00:19:06,804 --> 00:19:08,603
After eating, don't sit down and work right away.

258
00:19:08,683 --> 00:19:10,482
Stand up and move around for a while, got it?

259
00:19:34,724 --> 00:19:36,253
What do you want to talk to me about?

260
00:19:37,197 --> 00:19:38,597
I was wondering

261
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:41,322
if you have time this week to go horseback riding.

262
00:19:41,907 --> 00:19:43,122
I don't have time this week.

263
00:19:43,827 --> 00:19:45,438
If you don't have time this week,

264
00:19:46,293 --> 00:19:48,574
- what about next week?   - I have plans next week.

265
00:19:52,404 --> 00:19:53,804
How about the week after that?

266
00:20:00,661 --> 00:20:02,271
What do you really want to talk to me about?

267
00:20:07,964 --> 00:20:09,654
I was thinking,

268
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,322
maybe we can do more things together, like having dinner,

269
00:20:15,076 --> 00:20:16,476
horseback riding,

270
00:20:16,889 --> 00:20:18,460
watching movies, and such.

271
00:20:32,677 --> 00:20:34,122
And after that?

272
00:20:41,244 --> 00:20:42,442
Guan Ji,

273
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,562
you know you have many people who can have dinner,

274
00:20:45,643 --> 00:20:47,962
go horseback riding, and watch movies with you.

275
00:20:51,403 --> 00:20:53,053
Have you ever thought about

276
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:56,591
what kind of relationship we should have when doing these things together?

277
00:21:19,058 --> 00:21:20,522
I've finished eating.

278
00:21:22,092 --> 00:21:23,492
Thank you for the dinner.

279
00:21:23,804 --> 00:21:25,204
I should go home.

280
00:21:28,292 --> 00:21:29,692
No need to drive me home.

281
00:21:29,835 --> 00:21:31,235
I can order a cab myself.

282
00:21:41,651 --> 00:21:43,181
If you have time,

283
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:45,787
you should think about

284
00:21:45,969 --> 00:21:47,980
what you really want.

285
00:22:11,907 --> 00:22:14,706
I'm home. Rest early. Good night.

286
00:22:22,973 --> 00:22:25,002
Uncle, you're home.

287
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,750
What are you up to?

288
00:22:34,371 --> 00:22:35,771
I'm doing homework.

289
00:22:39,437 --> 00:22:40,677
Your superior has taught you well.

290
00:22:40,788 --> 00:22:42,402
Finish your homework and go to bed early.

291
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,930
What did my superior teach me?

292
00:22:58,013 --> 00:22:59,693
Shu Yi, you have a visitor.

293
00:22:59,774 --> 00:23:01,424
I've got him waiting in the conference room.

294
00:23:03,611 --> 00:23:05,382
Is it the boy from earlier?

295
00:23:05,764 --> 00:23:06,797
Who is it?

296
00:23:18,402 --> 00:23:19,802
(It's him.)

297
00:23:34,438 --> 00:23:36,402
Hi. I'm Yi Yang.

298
00:23:37,924 --> 00:23:39,682
Hi, Mr. Yi.

299
00:23:40,076 --> 00:23:41,486
I'm Zheng Shu Yi.

300
00:23:41,635 --> 00:23:43,035
You want to see me?

301
00:23:43,276 --> 00:23:44,436
Miss Zheng,

302
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,573
I'd like to make an appointment with you for an interview like this.

303
00:23:50,725 --> 00:23:52,685
Let's confirm this matter today.

304
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,059
Then, we'll schedule a time.

305
00:23:54,204 --> 00:23:55,735
After you send me the interview outline,

306
00:23:55,816 --> 00:23:57,306
I will prepare accordingly.

307
00:24:00,664 --> 00:24:02,802
Also, I have a request.

308
00:24:03,242 --> 00:24:04,762
I want my interview to be featured in

309
00:24:04,881 --> 00:24:07,601
Financial Introduce's digital magazine.

310
00:24:12,848 --> 00:24:14,607
Mr. Yi, please take a look.

311
00:24:14,688 --> 00:24:17,179
I'm afraid my schedule will only be open around the week after next.

312
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:19,802
I can wait.

313
00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:25,009
May I ask what industry you work in,

314
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,490
and where you're based, Mr. Yi?

315
00:24:27,084 --> 00:24:29,964
This is good. You're already showing interest in getting to know me better.

316
00:24:30,363 --> 00:24:32,654
How about this? To help you understand me better,

317
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:36,295
I'm having a livestream press conference this Friday at 3pm.

318
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:39,318
I'd like to invite you as the only media representative.

319
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:42,483
Mr. Yi, you just looked at my schedule.

320
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:45,733
I still hope you can make time to attend.

321
00:24:46,004 --> 00:24:47,603
It will help you get a quicker

322
00:24:47,683 --> 00:24:50,694
and deeper understanding into your future interview subject.

323
00:24:53,324 --> 00:24:54,563
Let's exchange WeChat IDs.

324
00:24:54,643 --> 00:24:56,094
I'll send you the address later.

325
00:25:04,592 --> 00:25:05,992
What did he want with you?

326
00:25:07,244 --> 00:25:08,444
He said his name is Yi Yang.

327
00:25:08,524 --> 00:25:09,697
And he'd like me to interview him.

328
00:25:10,547 --> 00:25:12,397
He sounds like a delusional guy.

329
00:25:12,843 --> 00:25:15,323
He might be a scammer. Be careful.

330
00:25:15,643 --> 00:25:17,043
That's right.

331
00:25:17,443 --> 00:25:20,533
You should tell You Ran not to let him in next time.

332
00:25:21,596 --> 00:25:23,236
But when we were alone,

333
00:25:23,317 --> 00:25:25,438
he didn't do anything creepy.

334
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,082
Maybe he's a psychopath who's very good at concealing his true colors.

335
00:25:29,409 --> 00:25:31,642
You didn't share any personal information with him, did you?

336
00:25:42,284 --> 00:25:44,162
Shu Yi, I'm off to class.

337
00:26:04,788 --> 00:26:07,079
Has he graduated from college?

338
00:26:18,524 --> 00:26:20,733
So many people with the same name.

339
00:26:21,044 --> 00:26:22,694
I don't think it's any of them.

340
00:26:25,403 --> 00:26:27,244
What press conference?

341
00:26:27,324 --> 00:26:29,334
There's no news about it at all.

342
00:26:31,572 --> 00:26:33,383
Could he really be...

343
00:26:35,873 --> 00:26:39,442
Hey there, this seat is unoccupied. You can sit here.

344
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,940
Thanks.

345
00:26:42,021 --> 00:26:44,700
You're welcome. Professor Yu's class is always crowded.

346
00:26:44,824 --> 00:26:46,424
I've noticed you coming here for classes regularly,

347
00:26:46,505 --> 00:26:48,784
so I thought I'd save a seat for you.

348
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,244
By the way, I'm a Finance major from the class of 2020.

349
00:26:53,324 --> 00:26:54,763
I'm Qian Yu Cheng.

350
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,202
Hi.

351
00:26:57,701 --> 00:27:00,111
I see you attending this class every week,

352
00:27:00,364 --> 00:27:03,524
but I haven't seen you in any other major classes.

353
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:05,002
Who are you?

354
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:06,803
I'm not a student of University of Finance and Economics.

355
00:27:06,907 --> 00:27:08,712
I'm interning at Financial Introduce.

356
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:11,273
I came here specifically to attend Professor Yu's lectures

357
00:27:11,403 --> 00:27:12,803
to learn more and gain insights.

358
00:27:13,853 --> 00:27:15,253
I see.

359
00:27:15,989 --> 00:27:17,389
So you're a journalist?

360
00:27:18,321 --> 00:27:19,562
We...

361
00:27:28,004 --> 00:27:31,162
- Hello, students.   - Hello, professor.

362
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,280
Let's begin our class.

363
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:38,152
Today, we will be discussing market risk measurement.

364
00:27:38,233 --> 00:27:39,802
Please open your textbooks.

365
00:27:39,964 --> 00:27:42,603
We will focus on what risk measurement is.

366
00:27:42,753 --> 00:27:45,516
And secondly, the methods for measuring market risk.

367
00:27:45,643 --> 00:27:48,404
Yu Cheng, where is Professor Yu on?

368
00:27:51,084 --> 00:27:52,444
It's not on this page.

369
00:27:52,524 --> 00:27:53,644
It's right here.

370
00:27:53,724 --> 00:27:55,644
So, within the entire calculation of V2,

371
00:27:55,724 --> 00:27:58,334
the local valuation method is the simplest one.

372
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,754
Of course, besides the local valuation method,

373
00:28:08,188 --> 00:28:11,602
historical simulation is also a very important technique.

374
00:28:14,277 --> 00:28:15,962
Thank you so much today.

375
00:28:17,053 --> 00:28:18,962
You've thanked me many times.

376
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:21,560
Since you're coming from off-campus, it's not easy for you to find a seat.

377
00:28:21,672 --> 00:28:23,072
How about this?

378
00:28:24,672 --> 00:28:26,152
I'll save a seat for you next time.

379
00:28:26,233 --> 00:28:27,353
Really?

380
00:28:27,444 --> 00:28:28,844
I'm so grateful.

381
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:30,910
I'll treat you to a meal when I have the chance.

382
00:28:31,957 --> 00:28:33,282
Sure.

383
00:28:37,653 --> 00:28:39,053
Where did he go?

384
00:28:40,092 --> 00:28:42,002
Why did he leave so quickly?

385
00:28:50,985 --> 00:28:53,722
Shu Yi, are you working late again today?

386
00:28:54,465 --> 00:28:55,865
I'll just stay a little longer.

387
00:29:00,129 --> 00:29:01,442
Nan Nan,

388
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:04,878
you got full-on makeup today.

389
00:29:05,363 --> 00:29:07,322
Come clean now. What's going on with you?

390
00:29:08,315 --> 00:29:10,002
Nothing.

391
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,771
I'm going to sign a lease later.

392
00:29:12,864 --> 00:29:14,967
A lease? You've found a place?

393
00:29:15,048 --> 00:29:17,537
Yes, a friend helped me out.

394
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,522
I really have to go now.

395
00:29:21,643 --> 00:29:23,002
See you tomorrow. Bye.

396
00:29:23,084 --> 00:29:24,484
See you tomorrow.

397
00:29:42,835 --> 00:29:44,762
(Are you working late again today?)

398
00:29:48,116 --> 00:29:50,837
(Hang in there. I'm working late too.)

399
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:54,036
(We're supporting each other from afar. Let's finish our tasks quickly.)

400
00:29:54,147 --> 00:29:57,078
(I'll see you on the weekend when we're done with our work.)

401
00:29:58,068 --> 00:29:59,482
(I can't wait to see you.)

402
00:30:00,237 --> 00:30:02,407
(Okay, see you this weekend.)

403
00:30:33,619 --> 00:30:37,269
I'm starving. What should I order?

404
00:30:42,163 --> 00:30:45,002
- Hello.   - (Hello. Is this Zheng Shu Yi?)

405
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:46,212
(Your food is here.)

406
00:30:49,716 --> 00:30:51,674
Miss Zheng, here's your takeout.

407
00:30:52,883 --> 00:30:55,654
It's still warm and nothing spilled.

408
00:30:57,561 --> 00:30:59,121
Your boyfriend must be the one who placed the order.

409
00:30:59,202 --> 00:31:00,302
He's really considerate.

410
00:31:00,403 --> 00:31:02,283
He spent more than ten minutes on the phone with me,

411
00:31:02,363 --> 00:31:03,899
guiding me on where to buy a thermal container

412
00:31:03,982 --> 00:31:06,002
and how to get the noodles from the restaurant.

413
00:31:06,354 --> 00:31:07,675
I had to sneak around like a thief.

414
00:31:07,764 --> 00:31:09,164
It wasn't easy at all.

415
00:31:09,363 --> 00:31:10,508
Enjoy your meal while it's warm.

416
00:31:10,604 --> 00:31:13,802
Oh, and please ask him to give me a good review.

417
00:31:13,964 --> 00:31:15,364
Thank you.

418
00:31:31,163 --> 00:31:35,013
There are no spring onions inside. He's so attentive.

419
00:31:38,872 --> 00:31:41,471
(Thank you for the thoughtful takeout, Shi Yan.)

420
00:31:41,572 --> 00:31:43,162
(I really appreciate it.)

421
00:31:43,598 --> 00:31:45,928
(But I still prefer to eat it with you.)

422
00:32:25,574 --> 00:32:28,962
(Looking forward to your attendance and witness at 3pm.)

423
00:32:30,564 --> 00:32:32,642
18 Wanxing Road.

424
00:32:33,812 --> 00:32:35,823
What 18 Wanxing Road?

425
00:32:39,206 --> 00:32:40,606
Wanxing Road?

426
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:43,162
Isn't that over by the Science and Technology Park?

427
00:32:44,268 --> 00:32:45,668
Yi Yang?

428
00:32:46,609 --> 00:32:48,322
You're not actually going, are you?

429
00:32:48,443 --> 00:32:50,174
That area is quite remote.

430
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,540
- Hi, Miss Zheng.   - Hi, Mr. Yi.

431
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,020
You're here.

432
00:33:04,277 --> 00:33:06,437
The livestream hasn't started yet. Let me show you around.

433
00:33:06,564 --> 00:33:07,964
Thank you.

434
00:33:15,609 --> 00:33:18,129
So, this is the company.

435
00:33:18,269 --> 00:33:20,629
We just set it up this month, so it's relatively new.

436
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,780
Mr. Yi, are you just starting your own business?

437
00:33:23,891 --> 00:33:25,971
- Before this, were you...   - It's about time.

438
00:33:26,249 --> 00:33:29,778
You'll get answers to all your questions soon, Miss Zheng.

439
00:33:37,147 --> 00:33:38,351
You're doing the livestream here?

440
00:33:38,564 --> 00:33:39,964
Yes.

441
00:33:42,497 --> 00:33:45,220
When I was abroad, I had my own video channel.

442
00:33:45,331 --> 00:33:46,567
I used to livestream there often,

443
00:33:46,648 --> 00:33:49,221
sharing my research and life.

444
00:33:50,057 --> 00:33:52,137
The opening ceremony format here in China is quite cumbersome,

445
00:33:52,252 --> 00:33:55,011
so I wanted to try the livestream format for the launch.

446
00:33:55,169 --> 00:33:57,089
This way, more people can see it.

447
00:33:57,547 --> 00:33:59,102
I will continue to share my life and work

448
00:33:59,183 --> 00:34:00,593
in the livestreams in the future.

449
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,609
Did you really only invite me?

450
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,082
Of course.

451
00:34:09,924 --> 00:34:11,324
Please have a seat.

452
00:34:21,004 --> 00:34:23,962
Hello, everyone. I'm Yi Yang, Jackson Yi.

453
00:34:24,043 --> 00:34:25,522
I'm very excited to share the opening process

454
00:34:25,603 --> 00:34:27,642
of my company with you through this livestream.

455
00:34:27,723 --> 00:34:29,163
(Jackson Yi?)

456
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,602
(Why does that name sound so familiar?)

457
00:34:40,404 --> 00:34:43,003
(JY, the chip genius.)

458
00:34:43,243 --> 00:34:46,613
(He had a strong interest in semiconductors from the age of 14.)

459
00:34:46,845 --> 00:34:49,255
(He graduated from undergrad and went on to get a PhD.)

460
00:34:49,444 --> 00:34:51,643
(During college, he started a business with some classmates)

461
00:34:51,731 --> 00:34:54,524
(and made his first fortune from a few research projects.)

462
00:34:54,683 --> 00:34:57,924
I've always maintained a passionate relationship with challenges.

463
00:34:58,004 --> 00:34:59,573
Facing challenges and being challenged

464
00:34:59,707 --> 00:35:01,667
have always been the source of joy in my life,

465
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,573
as well as the driving force behind my progress.

466
00:35:03,683 --> 00:35:05,800
I'm fortunate to have many like-minded friends

467
00:35:05,881 --> 00:35:08,042
on this journey of constant challenges.

468
00:35:08,169 --> 00:35:09,780
Our challenge this time is

469
00:35:10,404 --> 00:35:11,804
Dark Horse Technology.

470
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:15,028
Joining me in this challenge is my good partner, Bruce.

471
00:35:15,163 --> 00:35:17,244
Next, please welcome my partner,

472
00:35:17,524 --> 00:35:18,924
Bruce.

473
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,402
Shi Yan.

474
00:35:36,924 --> 00:35:37,959
Don't look at me, look at the phone.

475
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,802
(Please welcome my partner, )

476
00:35:40,052 --> 00:35:41,282
(Bruce.)

477
00:35:41,385 --> 00:35:44,034
(This guy, JY is a very good friend of mine.)

478
00:35:44,203 --> 00:35:47,282
(We are very confident in leading Dark Horse's technical team)

479
00:35:47,485 --> 00:35:49,922
(to develop more high-performance chips)

480
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:53,122
(and take the entire industry to a new level.)

481
00:35:55,092 --> 00:35:56,652
What does Bruce mean by doing this?

482
00:35:56,763 --> 00:35:58,123
And who is this Jackson Yi?

483
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,123
Can someone please explain what's going on?

484
00:36:02,766 --> 00:36:04,216
Don't tell me you already knew?

485
00:36:05,793 --> 00:36:07,193
I had no idea.

486
00:36:13,564 --> 00:36:15,002
(Shi Yan, take a look at this.)

487
00:36:15,123 --> 00:36:16,562
(What are you going to do next?)

488
00:36:16,692 --> 00:36:18,183
(I'll talk to Bruce.)

489
00:36:23,293 --> 00:36:25,082
Let's go to Le'an to see Chen Kang.

490
00:36:29,683 --> 00:36:30,764
(Mr. Shi, )

491
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,240
(Bruce has left Le'an)

492
00:36:32,321 --> 00:36:34,520
(and joined a chip company called Dark Horse Technology.)

493
00:36:34,683 --> 00:36:36,083
I'm already aware of it.

494
00:36:36,626 --> 00:36:38,186
If he leaves now, doesn't that mean Le'an is done for?

495
00:36:38,283 --> 00:36:40,203
Uncle Tian and the others will not let you off the hook.

496
00:36:40,444 --> 00:36:41,444
Mr. Shi,

497
00:36:41,524 --> 00:36:43,884
Mr. Tian wants to meet with you for a meeting 30 minutes later.

498
00:36:59,484 --> 00:37:00,884
Thank you, everyone.

499
00:37:06,104 --> 00:37:07,122
Bruce,

500
00:37:07,611 --> 00:37:10,812
this is Zheng Shu Yi, a journalist from Financial Introduce.

501
00:37:10,946 --> 00:37:12,756
She's my special guest for today.

502
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:16,522
Hello, very nice to meet you, Miss Zheng.

503
00:37:21,593 --> 00:37:23,242
I need to take this. Sorry.

504
00:37:24,388 --> 00:37:25,682
Hello, You.

505
00:37:25,961 --> 00:37:26,961
Bruce,

506
00:37:27,075 --> 00:37:28,475
I think we need to talk.

507
00:37:29,052 --> 00:37:31,372
(I'm very sorry. I've made up my mind.)

508
00:37:31,493 --> 00:37:33,162
(I hope you will accept it.)

509
00:37:33,353 --> 00:37:34,358
Bruce,

510
00:37:34,486 --> 00:37:37,306
Yunchuang and Shi Yan have shown you good faith.

511
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,202
(And Le'an really needs you.)

512
00:37:39,484 --> 00:37:41,522
(You've been making good progress.)

513
00:37:42,713 --> 00:37:44,233
Actually, Shi Yan is outstanding,

514
00:37:44,314 --> 00:37:45,714
and Le'an is highly professional.

515
00:37:46,021 --> 00:37:48,162
(But I've known JY for many years.)

516
00:37:48,373 --> 00:37:49,922
(We share a common dream.)

517
00:37:50,044 --> 00:37:52,254
Plus, he's a genius in this field.

518
00:37:52,517 --> 00:37:55,575
Working with him offers me more possibilities.

519
00:37:56,084 --> 00:37:58,652
(I hope you can understand. I'm really sorry.)

520
00:38:05,668 --> 00:38:08,869
Thank you for coming all this way to witness the launch of Dark Horse.

521
00:38:09,651 --> 00:38:10,972
Congratulations, Mr. Yi.

522
00:38:11,112 --> 00:38:13,075
I'll wait for you to schedule the interview then.

523
00:38:13,179 --> 00:38:14,402
Mr. Yi...

524
00:38:16,524 --> 00:38:19,083
I may need some time to think it over

525
00:38:19,163 --> 00:38:20,563
and get back to you.

526
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,544
Okay.

527
00:38:23,243 --> 00:38:24,643
Just call me Yi Yang.

528
00:38:25,484 --> 00:38:27,110
If there's nothing else, I'll take my leave.

529
00:38:27,444 --> 00:38:30,013
- Do you need me to give you a ride?   - It's fine. I've ordered a cab.

530
00:38:46,764 --> 00:38:49,204
(Have you watched the livestream of Dark Horse Technology?)

531
00:38:49,338 --> 00:38:50,869
(What's the situation with Le'an?)

532
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:00,202
(Shi Yan, how are things on your end?)

533
00:39:35,789 --> 00:39:38,587
Sir, please take me to Mingyu Yunchuang instead. Sorry about this.

534
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,278
Miss Zheng, what brings you here?

535
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,800
Mr. Chen, sorry for showing up unannounced,

536
00:39:58,904 --> 00:40:00,264
but could you please take me to Mr. Shi?

537
00:40:00,345 --> 00:40:01,602
I need to see him urgently.

538
00:40:01,696 --> 00:40:04,096
Didn't you arrange a meeting time with Mr. Shi?

539
00:40:04,177 --> 00:40:05,868
He left just ten minutes ago.

540
00:40:45,273 --> 00:40:49,362
(Uncle, I'm staying in the old house tonight to do some research.)

541
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,610
(Shi Yan, I'm coming to you.)

542
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,082
(I'm fine. Don't worry about me.)

543
00:41:15,887 --> 00:41:17,322
Shi Yan.

544
00:41:25,765 --> 00:41:27,442
Why did you come over?

545
00:41:27,549 --> 00:41:28,949
Just felt like it.

546
00:41:29,163 --> 00:41:30,563
I missed you.

547
00:41:43,163 --> 00:41:44,602
Have you been drinking?

548
00:41:46,853 --> 00:41:49,263
Why didn't you invite me to drink with you?

549
00:41:49,612 --> 00:41:51,452
Little stingy, aren't you?

550
00:41:51,603 --> 00:41:53,163
After tasting the wine at your place last time,

551
00:41:53,243 --> 00:41:54,643
I couldn't stop thinking about it.

552
00:41:55,021 --> 00:41:56,421
I don't have any left.

553
00:41:59,537 --> 00:42:01,003
What you're drinking now,

554
00:42:01,084 --> 00:42:02,442
I've been craving it for a long time too.

555
00:42:02,523 --> 00:42:05,003
Pour me a glass. I'll drink with you.

556
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,458
Okay.
