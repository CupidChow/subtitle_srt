00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:36,122
(Only For Love)

2
00:01:36,203 --> 00:01:39,025
(Episode 26)

3
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:40,998
I remember your boyfriend is from our college's

4
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:42,397
Computer Science department, right?

5
00:01:42,897 --> 00:01:44,600
He and Chen Yue Ding are good friends.

6
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,360
Why didn't he come along?

7
00:01:46,771 --> 00:01:47,851
We broke up.

8
00:01:47,948 --> 00:01:49,298
I don't know if he'll come.

9
00:01:50,488 --> 00:01:51,838
Broke...

10
00:01:53,643 --> 00:01:55,482
I thought you wouldn't come.

11
00:01:56,268 --> 00:01:59,098
It's not my fault. Why wouldn't I come?

12
00:02:00,157 --> 00:02:01,878
You should have brought your boyfriend.

13
00:02:03,087 --> 00:02:04,437
You have one, right?

14
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,150
That is...

15
00:02:12,464 --> 00:02:14,882
- Why did you just arrive?   - I was caught in the traffic.

16
00:02:15,022 --> 00:02:16,741
Wishing you both a happy marriage. Congrats.

17
00:02:16,842 --> 00:02:18,550
- Thank you.   - Congrats, have a happy marriage.

18
00:02:18,631 --> 00:02:19,842
Thanks.

19
00:02:32,894 --> 00:02:33,972
Next up,

20
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:38,871
who's the lucky person who will get the bouquet in the bride's hand?

21
00:02:47,059 --> 00:02:48,299
Congratulations to this lucky lady.

22
00:02:48,397 --> 00:02:50,722
Quickly pass the microphone to this beautiful lady.

23
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,400
Beautiful lady, may I know if you have a boyfriend?

24
00:03:00,923 --> 00:03:03,339
(Even if I haven't seen a male creature in 10 years, )

25
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,365
(I have to say yes now.)

26
00:03:06,403 --> 00:03:07,543
I do.

27
00:03:09,542 --> 00:03:11,202
It must be God's will.

28
00:03:11,355 --> 00:03:15,113
Beautiful lady, you and your boyfriend will surely have a happy ending.

29
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:17,323
- Congratulations.   - Thanks.

30
00:03:45,229 --> 00:03:46,573
(Is the wedding fun?)

31
00:03:49,473 --> 00:03:50,762
(No.)

32
00:03:58,203 --> 00:04:00,442
(I met someone I hate.)

33
00:04:01,003 --> 00:04:03,404
(I'm very upset, not happy.)

34
00:04:14,363 --> 00:04:17,602
Uncle, why are you going to Qing'an?

35
00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:19,089
I already told you.

36
00:04:19,896 --> 00:04:21,496
When did you tell me?

37
00:04:22,722 --> 00:04:25,002
When you get to Qing'an, plan your own itinerary.

38
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,433
We agreed on it.

39
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,033
Of course.

40
00:04:28,563 --> 00:04:30,597
Uncle, don't simply find me when we get to Qing'an.

41
00:04:30,678 --> 00:04:32,277
I also have my own things to do.

42
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,890
(Yu You, guess where I am.)

43
00:04:45,673 --> 00:04:47,792
(I'm on my way to Qing'an.)

44
00:04:48,323 --> 00:04:50,443
(Can you show me around Qing'an?)

45
00:04:53,137 --> 00:04:54,177
(I'm sorry.)

46
00:04:54,265 --> 00:04:56,905
(I'm visiting my relatives with my parents.)

47
00:04:58,601 --> 00:05:01,601
(Tomorrow, it's time for you to get your third vaccine shot.)

48
00:05:02,837 --> 00:05:04,442
(He still remembers.)

49
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:07,551
(It's okay, I'll be staying there for a few days anyway.)

50
00:05:16,003 --> 00:05:18,003
Xing Zhou, I want some soup.

51
00:05:18,145 --> 00:05:19,495
Pour it for me.

52
00:05:23,136 --> 00:05:24,486
I don't want green onions.

53
00:05:42,081 --> 00:05:45,431
Xing Zhou, I want to eat that shrimp. Peel it for me.

54
00:05:52,605 --> 00:05:53,788
Okay.

55
00:06:05,521 --> 00:06:07,880
Xing Zhou, you're the best.

56
00:06:10,335 --> 00:06:11,602
Shu Yi.

57
00:06:11,964 --> 00:06:13,604
When do you plan to get married?

58
00:06:18,803 --> 00:06:20,682
I don't have a plan for that yet.

59
00:06:22,202 --> 00:06:23,522
It should be soon.

60
00:06:23,668 --> 00:06:25,882
Your boyfriend didn't come with you this time?

61
00:06:25,953 --> 00:06:27,313
Is he from out of town?

62
00:06:31,722 --> 00:06:33,282
What does your boyfriend do?

63
00:06:33,362 --> 00:06:34,802
Is he in the same profession as you?

64
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,541
It's good.

65
00:06:37,675 --> 00:06:39,472
If you're in the same profession, you have a common language.

66
00:06:39,555 --> 00:06:41,514
You can also help each other at work.

67
00:06:42,552 --> 00:06:44,080
Is he also a journalist?

68
00:06:44,161 --> 00:06:45,322
No.

69
00:06:48,362 --> 00:06:51,203
He must be from the financial industry, right? It's good.

70
00:06:51,296 --> 00:06:54,855
Men in the financial industry are well-off and highly educated.

71
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:58,091
Yes, I know him.

72
00:06:58,314 --> 00:07:01,522
He has good academic qualifications and is excellent in all aspects.

73
00:07:01,605 --> 00:07:03,563
He has dual degrees from a prestigious university abroad.

74
00:07:03,643 --> 00:07:05,082
He's a senior executive in an investment company

75
00:07:05,163 --> 00:07:07,199
with a surprisingly high salary.

76
00:07:07,308 --> 00:07:09,589
And he looks good.

77
00:07:09,678 --> 00:07:11,402
He has a good personality too.

78
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:13,010
He's almost perfect.

79
00:07:14,042 --> 00:07:16,123
It's just that...

80
00:07:19,537 --> 00:07:23,105
It's just that he's a bit older, and has a family.

81
00:07:23,868 --> 00:07:26,175
- A family?   - Is it true?

82
00:07:26,267 --> 00:07:29,522
Oh my, he's already married, and she's still messing around with him?

83
00:07:30,362 --> 00:07:32,122
What nonsense are you talking about?

84
00:07:33,235 --> 00:07:34,874
Just treat it as me talking nonsense.

85
00:07:35,961 --> 00:07:38,961
You can eat indiscriminately, but you can't talk indiscriminately.

86
00:07:39,363 --> 00:07:42,058
I understand this principle better than you.

87
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:43,442
Certainly.

88
00:07:43,522 --> 00:07:47,082
You do know better than me about destroying and meddling in relationships.

89
00:07:47,162 --> 00:07:48,762
I still haven't learned it.

90
00:07:49,285 --> 00:07:50,483
Zheng Shu Yi, you...

91
00:07:50,563 --> 00:07:51,963
Enough, stop it.

92
00:08:01,203 --> 00:08:02,363
(If you're not happy, just leave.)

93
00:08:02,443 --> 00:08:04,162
(I'm outside, come out.)

94
00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:10,679
I have something else to do. I'm leaving.

95
00:08:11,003 --> 00:08:12,163
This...

96
00:08:13,347 --> 00:08:15,312
Let's inform Yue Ding and ask him to check on her.

97
00:08:15,393 --> 00:08:16,522
Right.

98
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:25,089
Yue Xing Zhou, you actually scolded me for her.

99
00:08:40,683 --> 00:08:42,602
(Why is it you?)

100
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,162
(Why did the person rushing here)

101
00:08:46,423 --> 00:08:47,783
(have to be you?)

102
00:09:27,282 --> 00:09:29,282
You get bullied even when you're attending a wedding.

103
00:09:29,363 --> 00:09:30,713
You're getting old for nothing.

104
00:09:34,563 --> 00:09:35,922
Why are you staring at me?

105
00:09:36,049 --> 00:09:37,648
Am I the one who bullied you?

106
00:09:43,268 --> 00:09:44,402
Let's go.

107
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:08,722
Le Zhi. Le...

108
00:10:23,984 --> 00:10:25,402
What are you looking at?

109
00:10:25,642 --> 00:10:27,825
Come over and greet your elder.

110
00:10:29,923 --> 00:10:31,282
How come?

111
00:10:33,025 --> 00:10:35,056
How come Zheng Shu Yi is with Mr. Shi?

112
00:10:38,187 --> 00:10:41,562
(When did Zheng Shu Yi know that my uncle is...)

113
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,202
Le Le, what are you doing here?

114
00:10:48,346 --> 00:10:49,910
Uncle.

115
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,682
I'm here to attend a wedding.

116
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:57,809
(Uncle?)

117
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,591
(Mr. Fan is her uncle?)

118
00:11:03,523 --> 00:11:05,122
Uncle?

119
00:11:15,288 --> 00:11:16,687
Who are these people?

120
00:11:17,433 --> 00:11:19,482
(Aren't you her uncle?)

121
00:11:19,582 --> 00:11:21,722
(How did her uncle become your driver?)

122
00:11:22,173 --> 00:11:24,842
(What have I been doing these past few months?)

123
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:29,100
(It's over. My life is going to end today.)

124
00:11:32,553 --> 00:11:33,783
Shu Yi.

125
00:11:33,961 --> 00:11:35,442
I'm really sorry today.

126
00:11:35,523 --> 00:11:37,603
I didn't take care of you properly. I didn't arrange it well.

127
00:11:37,761 --> 00:11:39,111
I'm really sorry.

128
00:11:40,137 --> 00:11:41,417
It's fine.

129
00:11:41,558 --> 00:11:45,514
I should be the one to apologize for making a scene at your wedding.

130
00:11:45,602 --> 00:11:47,282
- What's going on?   - I don't know.

131
00:11:47,362 --> 00:11:50,847
It seems like the lady in red clothes said that the lady in the car

132
00:11:50,928 --> 00:11:53,362
is involved in others' marriage and is a mistress to a senior executive.

133
00:11:53,467 --> 00:11:55,162
She was so angry that she left on the spot.

134
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,425
I guess her real boyfriend has arrived.

135
00:11:57,506 --> 00:11:59,826
It's a misunderstanding. The situation is very awkward now.

136
00:12:01,043 --> 00:12:04,472
If someone tarnishes my reputation after cheating on me,

137
00:12:04,552 --> 00:12:07,162
I would definitely tear that person's mouth apart.

138
00:12:14,855 --> 00:12:16,816
I didn't expect her to defame you in person.

139
00:12:16,897 --> 00:12:18,037
I...

140
00:12:20,345 --> 00:12:23,305
Shu Yi, I'm really sorry.

141
00:12:23,683 --> 00:12:25,123
I'll make amends to you another day.

142
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,646
- Sorry.   - No need.

143
00:12:28,972 --> 00:12:31,562
It was a misunderstanding, and you weren't the cause of it.

144
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:32,822
Forget it.

145
00:12:33,852 --> 00:12:35,202
Forget it?

146
00:12:35,527 --> 00:12:38,922
You slandered my woman and want us to just forget it?

147
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,810
Did you ask for my consent?

148
00:12:47,563 --> 00:12:50,788
(Brother, please stop talking.)

149
00:12:50,869 --> 00:12:53,402
(You don't know anything, stop getting involved.)

150
00:12:58,163 --> 00:12:59,442
Mr. Shi...

151
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,571
- Mr. Shi, actually...   - I didn't ask you to explain.

152
00:13:21,962 --> 00:13:24,242
I don't want to know the process and the truth.

153
00:13:24,496 --> 00:13:25,846
I need you to apologize.

154
00:13:28,697 --> 00:13:29,802
Sorry.

155
00:13:32,087 --> 00:13:33,282
That's it?

156
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,562
Miss Zheng,

157
00:13:40,132 --> 00:13:41,722
I'm really sorry.

158
00:13:41,877 --> 00:13:45,082
I didn't understand the situation and made a rash statement.

159
00:13:45,816 --> 00:13:47,777
Please overlook my mistakes

160
00:13:48,378 --> 00:13:49,842
and forgive me for my recklessness.

161
00:13:57,642 --> 00:14:01,553
(No, the reckless one isn't you. It's me.)

162
00:14:04,641 --> 00:14:07,042
Okay, I'll forgive you.

163
00:14:22,343 --> 00:14:23,416
Let's go.

164
00:14:23,828 --> 00:14:25,242
Yes, Mr. Shi.

165
00:14:46,582 --> 00:14:47,932
Yue Xing Zhou.

166
00:14:48,043 --> 00:14:49,562
Look what trouble you've caused me.

167
00:14:49,717 --> 00:14:51,067
What do I owe you?

168
00:14:59,145 --> 00:15:00,755
Some people are really...

169
00:15:00,873 --> 00:15:04,634
They did some shameful things and thought everyone else was like her.

170
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:08,435
Let's go, the food is getting cold. Do you still want to eat?

171
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,740
Let's go.

172
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,522
Go enjoy the meal.

173
00:15:12,674 --> 00:15:15,339
The invitation card said that you should attend with your family.

174
00:15:15,443 --> 00:15:17,882
It should be a complete person, right?

175
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,080
Why do some people just bring a mouth and not a brain?

176
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,800
What's going on?

177
00:15:31,922 --> 00:15:33,272
What's going on?

178
00:15:33,457 --> 00:15:34,936
I made a mistake.

179
00:15:35,025 --> 00:15:37,542
When she came to our company, Mr. Qiu was so protective of her.

180
00:15:37,623 --> 00:15:39,086
- Of course I thought...   - I'm not talking about this.

181
00:15:39,167 --> 00:15:40,982
I'm talking about your uncle. What's going on?

182
00:15:42,283 --> 00:15:43,682
What's with my uncle?

183
00:15:43,762 --> 00:15:45,762
What does my uncle have to do with you?

184
00:15:45,838 --> 00:15:47,376
- You...   - What about me?

185
00:15:47,457 --> 00:15:49,482
Have I ever told you who my uncle is?

186
00:15:50,057 --> 00:15:51,642
These are all your own imaginations.

187
00:15:51,723 --> 00:15:53,180
Are you blaming me now?

188
00:15:53,338 --> 00:15:54,802
Yue Xing Zhou, you...

189
00:15:55,015 --> 00:15:56,375
Are you even a man?

190
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:10,766
(I hope some knives will fall from the sky and kill me.)

191
00:16:13,111 --> 00:16:14,461
Do you feel very hot?

192
00:16:19,183 --> 00:16:20,325
I'm not cold.

193
00:16:23,993 --> 00:16:25,993
Explain what happened today.

194
00:16:27,892 --> 00:16:29,653
Explain what?

195
00:16:33,523 --> 00:16:35,724
You mean those, those people?

196
00:16:36,448 --> 00:16:37,603
It's no big deal.

197
00:16:37,684 --> 00:16:40,244
That woman badmouthed me at the banquet.

198
00:16:46,792 --> 00:16:50,122
By the way, why did you come here suddenly?

199
00:16:50,985 --> 00:16:52,335
To look at the stars.

200
00:16:53,431 --> 00:16:54,781
Stars?

201
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:57,847
The air quality here is not good. You can't see the stars.

202
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:14,598
- Hello?   - (Hello, Shu Yi.)

203
00:17:14,686 --> 00:17:15,882
Are you at home now?

204
00:17:16,003 --> 00:17:17,322
I just arrived in your area.

205
00:17:17,402 --> 00:17:19,472
Do you have time to take a bath in the hot springs?

206
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,122
Sure.

207
00:17:22,243 --> 00:17:23,562
I promised you.

208
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:25,642
(I definitely won't stand you up. See you later.)

209
00:17:25,748 --> 00:17:27,162
When did we make a promise?

210
00:17:27,243 --> 00:17:28,362
Hello?

211
00:17:33,362 --> 00:17:35,581
(Zheng Shu Yi, don't be a coward.)

212
00:17:35,662 --> 00:17:37,228
(Being a coward makes it easy to be exposed.)

213
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:45,513
- Well...   - You have something to attend to?

214
00:17:49,785 --> 00:17:53,385
My friend invited me to a hot spring.

215
00:17:53,532 --> 00:17:54,882
I don't know you...

216
00:17:59,217 --> 00:18:00,456
Well...

217
00:18:00,695 --> 00:18:03,496
Our hometown is well-known for the night view.

218
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,760
You can take a look around.

219
00:18:04,842 --> 00:18:06,192
Then that...

220
00:18:06,642 --> 00:18:08,163
The grouper is also very special.

221
00:18:08,243 --> 00:18:10,162
You should try it if you have the chance.

222
00:18:10,763 --> 00:18:12,202
Are you avoiding me?

223
00:18:12,723 --> 00:18:14,482
(You're too clever.)

224
00:18:16,922 --> 00:18:18,082
Why would I avoid you?

225
00:18:18,162 --> 00:18:20,272
I'm delighted that you came to my hometown.

226
00:18:20,353 --> 00:18:22,304
But I really made plans with a friend today.

227
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,520
Really? You're not going on a blind date, are you?

228
00:18:27,802 --> 00:18:30,642
Why would I have a blind date? Am I that idle?

229
00:18:41,941 --> 00:18:43,291
Where do you want to get off?

230
00:18:43,643 --> 00:18:45,189
Here is fine.

231
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,282
Up to you.

232
00:19:02,929 --> 00:19:05,421
Shu Yi agreed to it right away,

233
00:19:06,402 --> 00:19:08,673
then she must be alone.

234
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:12,922
Could it be that Uncle didn't go to see her?

235
00:19:16,103 --> 00:19:18,373
Uncle, where are you going?

236
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:21,322
Qing'an.

237
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:26,478
Where are you going?

238
00:19:26,596 --> 00:19:27,755
I'm going out to play.

239
00:19:27,836 --> 00:19:29,436
I can also go to Qing'an to play.

240
00:19:35,248 --> 00:19:38,288
(Isn't Qing'an the hometown of Shu Yi?)

241
00:19:38,882 --> 00:19:42,842
(So, it's very likely that Uncle is here to see Shu Yi.)

242
00:19:43,138 --> 00:19:45,442
(Or else, why would he come here on the fourth day of the Lunar New Year?)

243
00:19:46,579 --> 00:19:51,442
But Shu Yi already has someone in her heart, so Uncle...

244
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,976
No, I have to help my uncle.

245
00:20:05,768 --> 00:20:07,515
- Shan Shan.   - (I'm playing mahjong.)

246
00:20:07,596 --> 00:20:10,082
(Let's talk later. I'm waiting for a comeback.)

247
00:20:10,387 --> 00:20:13,282
What comeback? Your sister has failed.

248
00:20:14,443 --> 00:20:16,162
I need to take this call.

249
00:20:19,323 --> 00:20:20,414
All right, spill it.

250
00:20:20,495 --> 00:20:21,845
What happened?

251
00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:29,667
It's quite messed up, especially since Shi Yan isn't an ordinary person.

252
00:20:29,748 --> 00:20:32,602
If he finds out about this, you two are done for sure.

253
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:34,482
(If he's a bit more narrow-minded, )

254
00:20:34,593 --> 00:20:37,242
(he might even make it hard for you to stay in this industry.)

255
00:20:37,323 --> 00:20:39,242
I'm not trying to scare you.

256
00:20:39,652 --> 00:20:43,171
If people go crazy for love, it can be really scary.

257
00:20:43,729 --> 00:20:45,650
I'm not afraid of these things.

258
00:20:46,323 --> 00:20:48,202
(I'm afraid of losing him.)

259
00:20:49,763 --> 00:20:53,433
Shan Shan, do you think I should tell him the truth?

260
00:20:53,521 --> 00:20:56,802
If he really likes me, really loves me,

261
00:20:56,883 --> 00:20:58,233
he'll forgive me, right?

262
00:20:59,473 --> 00:21:00,872
Listen to me.

263
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:04,403
I think only heaven, the earth, you and I know about this.

264
00:21:04,483 --> 00:21:06,603
Since no third person knows...

265
00:21:08,038 --> 00:21:09,977
Does anyone else know about this?

266
00:21:12,707 --> 00:21:13,988
Yes, there is.

267
00:21:14,176 --> 00:21:15,455
Who?

268
00:21:15,536 --> 00:21:16,886
(Qin Shi Yue.)

269
00:21:17,763 --> 00:21:19,442
(But I just told her about the situation.)

270
00:21:19,523 --> 00:21:21,469
I didn't specify who it was.

271
00:21:22,363 --> 00:21:25,564
(That's fine. Yue doesn't know who the uncle you're chasing is.)

272
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:27,226
It won't be a problem.

273
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,651
Since Shi Yan has no way of knowing the truth,

274
00:21:29,729 --> 00:21:32,057
just continue as if nothing happened.

275
00:21:32,138 --> 00:21:34,619
(Just play cute with him and fool him to get through this.)

276
00:21:34,947 --> 00:21:36,707
No, your idea...

277
00:21:36,803 --> 00:21:39,562
(My idea is to get the best of both worlds.)

278
00:21:39,713 --> 00:21:41,402
Don't you like him?

279
00:21:41,642 --> 00:21:43,243
Then, just act like nothing happened.

280
00:21:43,324 --> 00:21:45,634
(Continue dating him according to the current pace.)

281
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:16,011
Shu Yi, you don't look too good.

282
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:19,854
I was tired from the Lunar New Year.

283
00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:21,723
Same.

284
00:22:21,803 --> 00:22:25,162
At our age, we can't play around like children,

285
00:22:25,323 --> 00:22:27,282
nor can we talk much with the elders.

286
00:22:27,381 --> 00:22:30,571
We can only sit quietly, as though we're meditating.

287
00:22:31,654 --> 00:22:34,882
Don't think about it. Let's relax today.

288
00:22:55,115 --> 00:22:56,155
Shu Yi.

289
00:22:57,243 --> 00:23:00,823
What's going on between you and Yu You?

290
00:23:01,472 --> 00:23:02,712
Nothing.

291
00:23:02,793 --> 00:23:04,473
We're just doing it for our parents.

292
00:23:04,554 --> 00:23:06,624
We probably won't need to do it anymore after some time.

293
00:23:09,276 --> 00:23:10,626
Then that...

294
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:12,924
What happened to the person you chased?

295
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,780
Nothing happened.

296
00:23:16,017 --> 00:23:17,242
You quit?

297
00:23:18,207 --> 00:23:20,886
Forget it. It's too complicated, too difficult.

298
00:23:22,718 --> 00:23:23,962
Indeed.

299
00:23:24,243 --> 00:23:26,762
They say there's no barrier when a lady pursues a man.

300
00:23:27,003 --> 00:23:28,992
But it also depends on what kind of man you are chasing.

301
00:23:30,116 --> 00:23:32,477
(If it's someone like my uncle, )

302
00:23:33,035 --> 00:23:36,245
(then they are separated by a layer of electric shock net.)

303
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:40,842
Shu Yi, don't be too upset.

304
00:23:41,812 --> 00:23:44,842
How about I introduce my uncle to you?

305
00:23:45,104 --> 00:23:48,131
He's definitely more handsome and wealthy than the mistress' uncle.

306
00:23:48,212 --> 00:23:49,362
No, thanks.

307
00:23:49,893 --> 00:23:52,152
I don't want to know any uncle now.

308
00:23:53,859 --> 00:23:55,101
Stop overthinking it.

309
00:23:55,182 --> 00:23:59,090
Shu Yi, you look radiant now. Let's take a selfie.

310
00:24:04,629 --> 00:24:05,771
Okay.

311
00:24:11,236 --> 00:24:12,266
(I've arrived in Qing'an.)

312
00:24:12,347 --> 00:24:14,243
(I just finished soaking in the hot springs with a friend.)

313
00:24:14,323 --> 00:24:16,815
(Is this the leader you mentioned? She's pretty.)

314
00:24:16,907 --> 00:24:19,402
(After the hot springs, your complexion has improved a lot.)

315
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:21,866
(Be careful when you girls are out.)

316
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,320
(Uncle.)

317
00:24:31,401 --> 00:24:33,122
(Shu Yi is facing a setback in her relationship.)

318
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,129
(It's a good opportunity to take advantage of this.)

319
00:24:36,022 --> 00:24:39,061
(Hesitation leads to defeat. Decisiveness may bring unexpected gains.)

320
00:24:45,251 --> 00:24:48,650
Won't you reconsider? My uncle is a great person.

321
00:25:02,715 --> 00:25:04,793
(What a coincidence.)

322
00:25:17,103 --> 00:25:18,237
Uncle.

323
00:25:19,672 --> 00:25:20,839
(Uncle?)

324
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,762
(Uncle?)

325
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,566
What setbacks are you facing in your relationship?

326
00:25:28,512 --> 00:25:31,482
(I told you the situation so that you can take advantage of it.)

327
00:25:31,684 --> 00:25:34,364
(I didn't ask you to come here to hit the ball straight like this.)

328
00:25:34,483 --> 00:25:38,363
(Is relationship setback the main point? You straight guy!)

329
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:47,712
Uncle, I was just chatting with Shu Yi.

330
00:25:47,862 --> 00:25:52,922
Besides, she only suffered a little setback, not...

331
00:25:56,882 --> 00:25:58,322
(Sister, you're really something.)

332
00:25:58,402 --> 00:25:59,923
(There's nothing you can't do.)

333
00:26:00,003 --> 00:26:01,643
(You're a champion in creating troubles for me.)

334
00:26:02,897 --> 00:26:04,247
Go back to your room.

335
00:26:10,563 --> 00:26:11,913
I'm leaving then.

336
00:26:38,796 --> 00:26:40,517
What did I miss?

337
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:43,056
Why did they suddenly hold hands?

338
00:26:59,509 --> 00:27:03,202
Now you can tell me how I caused you relationship setbacks.

339
00:27:04,268 --> 00:27:05,744
(Qin Shi Yue said I had relationship setbacks.)

340
00:27:05,825 --> 00:27:08,162
(Shi Yan naturally understood it as a setback from him.)

341
00:27:08,243 --> 00:27:10,122
(If I were to say the setback came from someone else, )

342
00:27:10,203 --> 00:27:12,002
(I might have to leave here horizontally.)

343
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:15,122
(I really want to drag Qin Shi Yue out and beat her up.)

344
00:27:18,442 --> 00:27:21,282
It's no big deal.

345
00:27:22,882 --> 00:27:26,162
Didn't I misunderstand that you like Qin Shi Yue before?

346
00:27:26,408 --> 00:27:27,682
I felt so bad.

347
00:27:27,835 --> 00:27:31,185
Today, I found out that you came to Qing'an with her.

348
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:34,177
I felt depressed.

349
00:27:34,723 --> 00:27:37,202
Now, I know that you're her uncle.

350
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:41,360
Look, if you had told me earlier, I wouldn't have over thought it.

351
00:27:41,476 --> 00:27:43,562
It's all good now. My frustration is gone.

352
00:27:57,949 --> 00:27:59,882
You speak so sincerely.

353
00:28:00,371 --> 00:28:02,252
So, do you like me so much?

354
00:28:03,012 --> 00:28:04,642
(This is a good question.)

355
00:28:04,765 --> 00:28:06,805
(It's so good that it can directly bury me.)

356
00:28:10,043 --> 00:28:12,962
I'm indeed a very narrow-minded person.

357
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,562
Don't avoid the question.

358
00:28:37,372 --> 00:28:38,452
Tell me

359
00:28:38,555 --> 00:28:39,955
how much you like me.

360
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,323
Compared to your ex-boyfriend,

361
00:28:46,883 --> 00:28:48,362
do you like him more

362
00:28:48,487 --> 00:28:49,837
or like me more?

363
00:28:50,532 --> 00:28:52,202
(What kind of option is this?)

364
00:28:52,283 --> 00:28:53,843
(Can I choose neither of them?)

365
00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:56,109
Of course it's you.

366
00:28:58,605 --> 00:29:00,205
I believe you this time.

367
00:29:08,963 --> 00:29:11,282
Then when will you only like me?

368
00:29:23,936 --> 00:29:26,282
(Is this man so possessive?)

369
00:29:26,363 --> 00:29:29,322
(If he finds out that I did this to take revenge on Yue Xing Zhou...)

370
00:29:29,443 --> 00:29:30,522
(I'm doomed.)

371
00:29:30,615 --> 00:29:34,279
(I'm afraid I'll never see such beautiful scenery again.)

372
00:29:43,655 --> 00:29:45,258
- Hello, Dad.   - (Yi Yi.)

373
00:29:45,339 --> 00:29:47,082
(Are you coming home tonight?)

374
00:29:48,422 --> 00:29:50,355
I will. I'll surely come back.

375
00:29:50,436 --> 00:29:53,636
(It's okay, enjoy some more time outside with your friend.)

376
00:29:53,724 --> 00:29:56,674
I know. I'll go back right away. Don't worry.

377
00:30:00,092 --> 00:30:02,202
My dad is here to pick me up. I'm going home.

378
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,539
What a good girl.

379
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:07,011
You have to go home when it gets dark?

380
00:30:19,123 --> 00:30:21,913
Then tomorrow, you should at least fulfill your duties as a host, right?

381
00:30:22,803 --> 00:30:23,962
What?

382
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:27,801
You should be aware that I came to Qing'an for you, right?

383
00:31:00,302 --> 00:31:02,902
(People only want to believe what they want to believe.)

384
00:31:03,151 --> 00:31:06,872
(If he wants to believe what he heard, there's no point in explaining it.)

385
00:31:07,482 --> 00:31:08,642
(I don't have a boyfriend.)

386
00:31:08,764 --> 00:31:12,391
(The day we first met, I broke up with him when I went back.)

387
00:31:13,194 --> 00:31:14,544
(So what?)

388
00:31:14,946 --> 00:31:16,387
(So...)

389
00:31:16,682 --> 00:31:18,032
(Can I chase you?)

390
00:31:20,102 --> 00:31:23,648
(Did your ex-boyfriend ever mention that you're heavy?)

391
00:31:23,867 --> 00:31:25,507
(No one has held me like that before.)

392
00:31:25,642 --> 00:31:26,762
(But I think)

393
00:31:26,873 --> 00:31:30,114
(you have the potential to be the first boyfriend to say that to me.)

394
00:31:30,884 --> 00:31:32,234
(Shi Yan.)

395
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:35,482
(I will love you well and not let you down.)

396
00:31:39,922 --> 00:31:43,202
(Zheng Shu Yi, no matter why you approach me, )

397
00:31:43,338 --> 00:31:45,218
(I just want you to tell me the truth.)

398
00:31:46,308 --> 00:31:49,229
(I can give you whatever you want.)

399
00:31:58,754 --> 00:31:59,842
Mr. Shi.

400
00:32:00,697 --> 00:32:03,658
I'd like to confirm with you about the private room for tomorrow night.

401
00:32:04,985 --> 00:32:06,242
Sure.

402
00:32:11,723 --> 00:32:13,322
You're back so early.

403
00:32:18,309 --> 00:32:20,322
What friend did you meet?

404
00:32:36,009 --> 00:32:38,169
(Then when will you only like me?)

405
00:32:45,678 --> 00:32:46,882
What's the matter?

406
00:32:47,429 --> 00:32:48,882
Mr. Shi.

407
00:32:49,169 --> 00:32:53,242
I came here specifically to apologize to you on behalf of my niece.

408
00:32:54,415 --> 00:32:55,642
Go ahead.

409
00:32:57,139 --> 00:32:58,739
My niece didn't know better.

410
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:01,890
She ruined the relationship between Miss Zheng and her ex-boyfriend.

411
00:33:02,523 --> 00:33:04,322
I've already seriously criticized her.

412
00:33:04,412 --> 00:33:05,602
She also knew she was wrong.

413
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:08,282
And she has already broken up with that man.

414
00:33:09,232 --> 00:33:13,103
Later, I'll have her apologize to Miss Zheng in person.

415
00:33:13,473 --> 00:33:14,632
Then...

416
00:33:14,803 --> 00:33:15,803
Apologize?

417
00:33:15,914 --> 00:33:18,602
And let Shu Yi and her ex-boyfriend rekindle their old flame?

418
00:33:20,185 --> 00:33:21,991
No, it's impossible.

419
00:33:22,072 --> 00:33:24,032
It's absolutely impossible for them to get back together.

420
00:33:24,787 --> 00:33:27,402
It's just that that guy is so unreliable.

421
00:33:27,497 --> 00:33:29,282
Miss Zheng

422
00:33:29,669 --> 00:33:31,122
had a wake-up call.

423
00:33:31,617 --> 00:33:32,967
Had a wake-up call.

424
00:33:34,823 --> 00:33:36,744
What's so bad about her ex-boyfriend?

425
00:33:37,202 --> 00:33:39,162
This guy is too vain.

426
00:33:39,444 --> 00:33:40,863
As a man,

427
00:33:40,959 --> 00:33:42,682
instead of working hard to strive for success,

428
00:33:42,815 --> 00:33:44,162
he just wants to take shortcuts.

429
00:33:44,264 --> 00:33:45,614
He thought you were...

430
00:33:47,922 --> 00:33:49,272
What did he think I was?

431
00:33:50,165 --> 00:33:51,962
This is all a misunderstanding.

432
00:33:52,244 --> 00:33:54,204
He thought you were Le Le's uncle.

433
00:33:54,285 --> 00:33:57,474
So, he dumped Miss Zheng and got together with Le Le.

434
00:34:00,162 --> 00:34:01,722
(So that's it.)

435
00:34:06,108 --> 00:34:07,908
Understood, go get some rest.

436
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:17,107
(After all, Shi Yan is a man.)

437
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:19,767
(Wait until he gets over it, throw in some coquetry, )

438
00:34:19,848 --> 00:34:21,602
(and he'll still be yours.)

439
00:34:23,654 --> 00:34:25,374
(I thought you wanted money)

440
00:34:25,587 --> 00:34:27,027
(and resources.)

441
00:34:27,129 --> 00:34:28,762
(But it turns out it's not.)

442
00:34:28,936 --> 00:34:30,286
What you want

443
00:34:31,396 --> 00:34:32,995
was never me.

444
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,562
Sir, please give way.

445
00:35:01,835 --> 00:35:04,042
Should I confess to Shi Yan?

446
00:35:30,314 --> 00:35:32,442
(Zheng Shu Yi, you've got what you wanted now.)

447
00:35:32,587 --> 00:35:35,002
(You embarrassed me and let Yue Xing Zhou know the truth.)

448
00:35:35,083 --> 00:35:36,433
(But don't be complacent.)

449
00:35:36,578 --> 00:35:38,442
(Shi Yan still doesn't know the truth, right?)

450
00:35:38,555 --> 00:35:40,442
(If Shi Yan knew that you approached him to take revenge)

451
00:35:40,523 --> 00:35:41,958
(on me and Yue Xing Zhou, )

452
00:35:42,044 --> 00:35:43,490
(what do you think he will do to you?)

453
00:35:43,602 --> 00:35:45,922
(Do you think you're any different from me?)

454
00:35:46,098 --> 00:35:48,538
(Your relationship also began with deception.)

455
00:35:48,674 --> 00:35:50,504
(Nothing good will come of it for you either.)

456
00:35:51,738 --> 00:35:52,939
(Qin Le Zhi.)

457
00:35:53,043 --> 00:35:56,162
(Don't blame others for your mistakes.)

458
00:35:56,523 --> 00:35:58,362
(You're not worthy of telling me these things.)

459
00:35:58,493 --> 00:36:00,213
(I'm different from you.)

460
00:36:11,883 --> 00:36:13,562
(Let's go to the aquarium.)

461
00:36:14,021 --> 00:36:17,180
(Tomorrow at 10 am, let's meet at the entrance of the aquarium.)

462
00:36:38,283 --> 00:36:39,643
Shan Shan.

463
00:36:39,998 --> 00:36:41,348
I've figured it out.

464
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:44,048
I really fell in love with Shi Yan.

465
00:36:44,763 --> 00:36:47,754
But my initial purpose of approaching him was indeed not pure.

466
00:36:48,842 --> 00:36:50,362
No matter what the result will be,

467
00:36:50,544 --> 00:36:53,682
I'll tell Shi Yan everything tomorrow.

468
00:36:54,243 --> 00:36:56,714
I'll apologize to him and ask him to forgive me.

469
00:36:57,043 --> 00:36:59,322
I'll make our future relationship pure.

470
00:37:10,669 --> 00:37:14,029
(Are you sure you've decided and won't regret it?)

471
00:37:17,163 --> 00:37:18,682
If I don't tell him, I'll regret it.

472
00:37:31,009 --> 00:37:35,929
(But every once in a while, you find someone who's iridescent, )

473
00:37:37,923 --> 00:37:39,273
(and when you do, )

474
00:37:40,363 --> 00:37:42,282
(nothing will ever compare.)

475
00:37:48,081 --> 00:37:49,282
Who is it?

476
00:37:56,313 --> 00:37:58,194
Uncle, what are you doing here?

477
00:38:01,083 --> 00:38:02,722
Shu Yi already left?

478
00:38:10,242 --> 00:38:12,322
What do you want from me?

479
00:38:12,569 --> 00:38:13,919
Nothing.

480
00:38:14,305 --> 00:38:17,482
I can't take advantage of the situation.

481
00:38:17,637 --> 00:38:18,869
What should I do?

482
00:38:20,167 --> 00:38:21,232
(Oh my god.)

483
00:38:21,313 --> 00:38:23,870
(Uncle actually admitted that he took advantage of the situation.)

484
00:38:23,963 --> 00:38:27,243
(He even said such embarrassing things to me.)

485
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:30,562
How is that possible, Uncle? You're so outstanding.

486
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:32,843
There is no one better than you in this world.

487
00:38:32,923 --> 00:38:35,522
As long as you put in a little more effort,

488
00:38:35,633 --> 00:38:37,396
success will be within your grasp.

489
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:38,960
Is that so?

490
00:38:39,162 --> 00:38:42,283
But she has someone in her heart. How can I try harder?

491
00:38:43,897 --> 00:38:45,377
It's because of this?

492
00:38:46,255 --> 00:38:48,322
She did pursue another man before.

493
00:38:48,403 --> 00:38:50,685
But don't worry, it wasn't sincere.

494
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:52,170
She had other reasons.

495
00:38:52,328 --> 00:38:54,602
And she has given up now.

496
00:38:54,941 --> 00:38:57,410
This is your chance, Uncle.

497
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:00,144
It's true.

498
00:39:00,363 --> 00:39:02,796
Right? I'm telling you, you just need to...

499
00:39:06,588 --> 00:39:09,482
What the heck, why such a gloomy face?

500
00:39:20,839 --> 00:39:22,802
(Hello, is this Mr. Shi?)

501
00:39:23,481 --> 00:39:24,762
(I'm the bar manager.)

502
00:39:24,843 --> 00:39:26,043
(Are you available now?)

503
00:39:26,177 --> 00:39:29,337
(I'd like to confirm with you about the private room for tomorrow night.)

504
00:39:29,802 --> 00:39:31,042
I don't need it anymore.

505
00:41:02,263 --> 00:41:03,282
Hello?

506
00:41:04,272 --> 00:41:05,993
Hello, Uncle.

507
00:41:06,074 --> 00:41:07,424
You're still awake?

508
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:09,273
(What's wrong?)

509
00:41:09,403 --> 00:41:10,700
My stomach hurts.

510
00:41:10,804 --> 00:41:12,154
(Put on your clothes.)

511
00:41:12,682 --> 00:41:13,963
(Put on your clothes.)

512
00:41:14,044 --> 00:41:15,394
I'll take you to the hospital.

513
00:41:16,646 --> 00:41:17,842
Okay.

514
00:41:18,363 --> 00:41:19,562
Thanks.

515
00:41:28,971 --> 00:41:32,192
Uncle, you didn't sleep all night?

516
00:41:38,683 --> 00:41:40,282
Have you been drinking?

517
00:41:40,618 --> 00:41:41,968
With whom?

518
00:41:47,995 --> 00:41:49,282
Uncle.

519
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,670
What did you mean by the question you asked earlier?

520
00:41:55,338 --> 00:41:56,562
Nothing.

521
00:42:01,242 --> 00:42:04,963
Let me tell you, women are often contradictory.

522
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:08,522
For someone like you, as long as you take a bit more initiative,

523
00:42:08,603 --> 00:42:11,403
no woman in the world can resist your charm.

524
00:42:13,225 --> 00:42:16,025
Uncle, I understand this aspect well.

525
00:42:16,436 --> 00:42:19,186
Just put in a little more effort, and the world is yours.

526
00:42:27,334 --> 00:42:28,722
Close your eyes.

527
00:42:29,043 --> 00:42:30,393
Rest for a bit.

528
00:43:01,722 --> 00:43:06,002
(I wanted to give you a surprise, but now I can only give you a shock.)

529
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:09,443
(I'm receiving infusions in the emergency room of Qing'an Hospital.)
