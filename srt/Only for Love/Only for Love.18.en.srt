1
00:01:31,002 --> 00:01:36,042
(Only for Love)

2
00:01:36,123 --> 00:01:38,962
(Episode 18)

3
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:41,242
Bye.

4
00:01:58,903 --> 00:02:02,031
Didn't you say you won't be back until next week?

5
00:02:02,917 --> 00:02:04,442
I have to take care of something here.

6
00:02:13,823 --> 00:02:16,309
Where is Mr. Chen? Didn't he come back with you?

7
00:02:17,548 --> 00:02:18,628
Why do you ask?

8
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:20,068
Do you want to see him?

9
00:02:20,148 --> 00:02:21,548
See Chen Sheng?

10
00:02:21,669 --> 00:02:23,069
Why do I want to see him?

11
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,159
Are you jealous, Mr. Shi?

12
00:02:33,782 --> 00:02:36,610
If you have nothing else to say, I'll go home now.

13
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,908
Why didn't you tell me

14
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,359
that you were celebrating New Year's Eve with your friends?

15
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,404
I didn't ask anyone to celebrate New Year's Eve with me.

16
00:03:16,428 --> 00:03:18,188
But you were on a business trip.

17
00:03:18,268 --> 00:03:19,645
So, Shan Shan and the others came here

18
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:21,149
to accompany me in case I was lonely.

19
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:22,999
So, we went shopping together

20
00:03:23,342 --> 00:03:25,522
and planned to have a hotpot at home.

21
00:03:25,965 --> 00:03:27,966
I didn't know that you would come back earlier.

22
00:03:28,062 --> 00:03:30,031
Plus, you didn't tell me about it beforehand.

23
00:03:50,028 --> 00:03:51,428
Where are we going now?

24
00:03:52,095 --> 00:03:53,495
We'll go stargazing.

25
00:03:56,295 --> 00:03:58,202
But I haven't prepared anything.

26
00:03:59,718 --> 00:04:00,748
I have.

27
00:04:00,828 --> 00:04:03,057
Book a private room for me on the top floor

28
00:04:03,151 --> 00:04:04,841
on the 31st of December.

29
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,682
Another thing. Please prepare a car full of roses and a card for me too.

30
00:04:09,934 --> 00:04:11,505
Deliver them after midnight.

31
00:04:13,334 --> 00:04:14,734
Okay. Thank you.

32
00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:26,509
Mr. Shi, can we serve the food now?

33
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,679
Did you plan everything in advance?

34
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,530
Why did you lie to me about coming back next week?

35
00:04:37,984 --> 00:04:39,384
I didn't lie to you.

36
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:44,642
So, did you purposely fly back to celebrate New Year's Eve with me?

37
00:05:00,304 --> 00:05:02,633
(Professor Yu, Happy New Year.)

38
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,440
(Have you eaten?)

39
00:05:10,781 --> 00:05:12,181
(What did you eat?)

40
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,969
Yue, time to eat.

41
00:05:16,081 --> 00:05:17,611
Okay. I'm coming.

42
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:23,666
You You.

43
00:05:23,747 --> 00:05:25,147
Time to eat.

44
00:05:39,411 --> 00:05:40,732
(It's New Year's Eve today.)

45
00:05:40,813 --> 00:05:42,682
(Do you eat dumplings on New Year's Eve?)

46
00:05:42,878 --> 00:05:44,808
(What kind of dumpling filling do you like?)

47
00:05:45,282 --> 00:05:47,455
(Are you celebrating New Year's Eve with your friends?)

48
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:48,867
(If you are celebrating it alone, )

49
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:50,291
(I can keep you company.)

50
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,762
Mom.

51
00:05:59,078 --> 00:06:01,397
I've asked you so many times to come and eat dinner.

52
00:06:01,478 --> 00:06:03,969
Hurry up. The food is getting cold.

53
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,478
I'm coming.

54
00:06:13,548 --> 00:06:15,042
How's the food today?

55
00:06:15,237 --> 00:06:17,028
- Not bad, right? - Not bad.

56
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:24,108
Yue. Stop playing with your phone. Hurry up and eat.

57
00:06:24,188 --> 00:06:25,403
Okay.

58
00:06:27,445 --> 00:06:29,522
Are you going to get into a relationship

59
00:06:29,726 --> 00:06:31,126
on the last day of this year?

60
00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:34,399
A Casanova like you will not understand.

61
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,908
Let's cheer. Come on.

62
00:06:39,988 --> 00:06:41,548
- Okay. - Yes. Cheers.

63
00:06:41,628 --> 00:06:44,148
- Happy New Year! - Happy New Year!

64
00:07:00,789 --> 00:07:03,399
Have you gained any insight from the inspection this time?

65
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,721
Have you made up your mind to give up on Zhanlan?

66
00:07:10,943 --> 00:07:12,503
I'm sorry. I forgot

67
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,200
that you don't discuss business matters during your private time.

68
00:07:16,183 --> 00:07:17,223
It's New Year's Eve today.

69
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,279
After tonight, you can ask me whatever you want.

70
00:07:30,302 --> 00:07:31,582
Eat.

71
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:47,508
Mr. Shi. It'll be midnight soon.

72
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,189
You can move on to the balcony now to watch the fireworks.

73
00:07:50,357 --> 00:07:51,918
It's almost midnight already.

74
00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:53,429
Let's go and take a look.

75
00:08:29,549 --> 00:08:30,960
There are so many people here.

76
00:08:31,446 --> 00:08:32,857
All of them are probably lovers

77
00:08:34,187 --> 00:08:35,587
or

78
00:08:35,733 --> 00:08:37,983
Soon-to-be lovers.

79
00:08:41,495 --> 00:08:42,722
Shi Yan.

80
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:44,202
Look.

81
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,810
We are quite lucky.

82
00:08:51,638 --> 00:08:54,242
Did you look at the stars when you were abroad?

83
00:08:54,508 --> 00:08:56,518
Yes. I looked at them every day.

84
00:08:56,677 --> 00:08:58,077
But

85
00:09:00,429 --> 00:09:02,309
they weren't as beautiful as the stars tonight.

86
00:09:31,469 --> 00:09:33,859
- Hello. - (Hello. Your food has been delivered.)

87
00:09:35,855 --> 00:09:37,042
Thank you.

88
00:09:41,661 --> 00:09:43,061
This chess piece.

89
00:09:50,886 --> 00:09:52,205
I'll take the Shi.

90
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,906
Unfortunately, my dad is on a business trip.

91
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:58,308
We can't celebrate New Year's Eve again this year.

92
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,052
How about we call him and wish him Happy New Year?

93
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,799
Sure. Let's ask him to give us some red packets too.

94
00:10:07,991 --> 00:10:10,322
A true gentleman keeps quiet while watching a chess game.

95
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:14,103
Guan Ji, you are no longer young.

96
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:16,518
It's time to find a girlfriend.

97
00:10:16,999 --> 00:10:18,930
When I was your age...

98
00:10:20,304 --> 00:10:22,558
You too, Yue.

99
00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:25,178
Grandpa, I'm still young.

100
00:10:25,356 --> 00:10:27,767
Yes. There's no need to rush Yue.

101
00:10:28,766 --> 00:10:30,366
Look at you. You are her mom.

102
00:10:33,836 --> 00:10:34,956
Come.

103
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,482
Hello?

104
00:11:03,805 --> 00:11:05,205
Didn't you

105
00:11:05,964 --> 00:11:07,364
go out to celebrate New Year's Eve?

106
00:11:08,189 --> 00:11:10,238
I did. But I'm back at home now.

107
00:11:13,414 --> 00:11:14,814
(What about you?)

108
00:11:15,134 --> 00:11:17,254
Are you celebrating New Year's Eve with your friends?

109
00:11:19,558 --> 00:11:20,958
I...

110
00:11:22,088 --> 00:11:23,679
Guan Ji. Stop talking on the phone.

111
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,409
(The countdown will begin soon. Come on.)

112
00:11:26,189 --> 00:11:27,826
Your friend is still waiting for you.

113
00:11:28,028 --> 00:11:29,602
(My friend is waiting for me too.)

114
00:11:29,774 --> 00:11:31,343
(We should hang up first. Bye.)

115
00:11:35,988 --> 00:11:38,323
Guan Ji, what are you doing? Come here.

116
00:11:40,508 --> 00:11:41,828
I'm coming.

117
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,285
- The countdown has started. - Hurry up. Come here.

118
00:11:53,309 --> 00:11:55,492
- The countdown has started. - Make a wish.

119
00:11:56,742 --> 00:11:59,343
Shi Yan, do you have any New Year's wishes?

120
00:11:59,805 --> 00:12:00,966
What about you?

121
00:12:01,109 --> 00:12:02,248
Me?

122
00:12:02,908 --> 00:12:05,670
I hope that everything will go well for my career

123
00:12:06,508 --> 00:12:08,148
and that I'll be in a sweet relationship.

124
00:12:11,901 --> 00:12:13,880
Ten, nine,

125
00:12:13,971 --> 00:12:16,349
eight, seven,

126
00:12:16,429 --> 00:12:18,629
six, five,

127
00:12:18,709 --> 00:12:20,948
four, three,

128
00:12:21,028 --> 00:12:23,282
two, one!

129
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,679
Happy New Year!

130
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:30,259
I want to be rich and slim!

131
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,801
Zheng Shu Yi, I...

132
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:59,949
I want to publish my digital magazine in the new year

133
00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:02,758
so that I write more articles that are even better!

134
00:13:36,429 --> 00:13:37,829
Shi Yan.

135
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,160
I...

136
00:13:44,251 --> 00:13:45,651
Mr. Shi.

137
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:48,834
The flowers that you've ordered are here.

138
00:13:55,508 --> 00:13:57,269
Help me deliver them to the old manor of Shi

139
00:13:57,349 --> 00:13:58,749
for Shi Huai Man.

140
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:00,573
Okay, Mr. Shi.

141
00:14:11,738 --> 00:14:14,802
Are those flowers for your sister?

142
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,439
She likes roses.

143
00:14:22,573 --> 00:14:24,744
(Do I have to face reality that quickly?)

144
00:14:24,871 --> 00:14:26,442
(I made a wish for my career.)

145
00:14:26,549 --> 00:14:27,959
(So, my relationship...)

146
00:14:28,878 --> 00:14:31,629
(Why didn't I make a wish to be together with Shi Yan)

147
00:14:31,748 --> 00:14:33,827
(or for him to accept my love confession?)

148
00:14:39,268 --> 00:14:41,439
Did you make a wish just now?

149
00:14:42,189 --> 00:14:43,482
Yes.

150
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:45,349
What did you wish for?

151
00:14:47,734 --> 00:14:50,322
I wish that you'll be able to publish

152
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:51,811
your digital magazine.

153
00:14:56,928 --> 00:14:59,698
Thank you for giving me your wish.

154
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,482
(Zheng Shu Yi, you are my best New Year's gift!)

155
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:30,829
(Happy New Year.)

156
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,240
(The fireworks in Jiangcheng are so beautiful.)

157
00:16:00,349 --> 00:16:02,238
(Are you watching the fireworks too?)

158
00:16:05,268 --> 00:16:07,118
(The fireworks in Qing'an are beautiful too.)

159
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,343
(Can we watch the fireworks show together next time?)

160
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,411
(What I mean is, )

161
00:16:21,949 --> 00:16:24,199
(can I pursue you?)

162
00:16:38,589 --> 00:16:39,998
(We are not meant to be together.)

163
00:16:45,643 --> 00:16:48,653
(How will you know that if you don't give us a chance?)

164
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,360
(There's no need to do a trial-and-error when it comes to love.)

165
00:17:10,294 --> 00:17:11,366
You You.

166
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,278
- Mom. - Who are you messaging so late at night?

167
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:16,268
Your girlfriend?

168
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:18,989
Just a normal friend.

169
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:20,838
Just a normal friend?

170
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:30,719
Who are you messaging?

171
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:32,989
Mom.

172
00:17:33,069 --> 00:17:34,469
Your boyfriend?

173
00:17:35,868 --> 00:17:37,479
I wish.

174
00:17:38,101 --> 00:17:41,272
Have you messaged your uncle to wish him a Happy New Year?

175
00:17:42,188 --> 00:17:43,588
I'll message him now.

176
00:17:44,589 --> 00:17:46,798
Who does she want to be in a relationship with?

177
00:17:48,749 --> 00:17:50,189
Here goes another one who's in love.

178
00:18:15,256 --> 00:18:17,282
Thank you for celebrating New Year with me.

179
00:18:17,364 --> 00:18:18,893
I'll go home now.

180
00:18:34,023 --> 00:18:35,423
Thank you.

181
00:18:46,109 --> 00:18:47,442
Shu Yi.

182
00:18:55,456 --> 00:18:57,038
May all your wishes come true

183
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,202
in the new year.

184
00:19:12,228 --> 00:19:13,442
Let's go.

185
00:19:20,188 --> 00:19:21,522
You too.

186
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,360
May your wishes come true.

187
00:19:33,468 --> 00:19:36,628
Shi Yan prepared a car full of roses but he didn't give it to you.

188
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:39,028
And you didn't confess your love to him.

189
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:44,950
I told you that you should let Shi Yan take the initiative.

190
00:19:45,037 --> 00:19:47,486
You can't confess your love to him first.

191
00:19:48,069 --> 00:19:49,838
Do you like him so much?

192
00:19:50,817 --> 00:19:53,467
He's indeed quite attractive to me.

193
00:19:53,973 --> 00:19:55,492
It's not easy for me to keep up

194
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,464
with this vague relationship between us

195
00:19:57,589 --> 00:19:59,758
without making things clear between us.

196
00:20:00,356 --> 00:20:01,756
As soon as I see him,

197
00:20:01,892 --> 00:20:03,943
I can't control what I say.

198
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:10,118
It's okay. You haven't known each other for long yet.

199
00:20:10,253 --> 00:20:12,413
He doesn't have a girlfriend and you have a boyfriend.

200
00:20:12,509 --> 00:20:14,038
There's a chance still.

201
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,614
(Maybe he was not ready)

202
00:20:15,705 --> 00:20:18,326
(because he came back too suddenly this time.)

203
00:20:18,613 --> 00:20:20,013
Perhaps.

204
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,640
(What did you wish for?)

205
00:20:23,399 --> 00:20:26,727
I wish that I can publish my digital magazine in the coming year.

206
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,068
Zheng Shu Yi, are you serious?

207
00:20:29,188 --> 00:20:31,949
Everyone on the balcony was talking about love and forever.

208
00:20:32,029 --> 00:20:35,159
(But you were shouting about publishing your digital magazine?)

209
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,439
No. How could Shi Yan confess to you if you acted like that?

210
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:41,359
It's not so easy to publish the digital magazine.

211
00:20:41,789 --> 00:20:43,399
But for love,

212
00:20:43,749 --> 00:20:45,868
if the person you like is right beside you,

213
00:20:45,948 --> 00:20:47,919
you can fight for it yourself.

214
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,719
The way your mind works has really become an eye-opener for me.

215
00:20:55,948 --> 00:20:58,199
So, you also think that I'm the issue.

216
00:20:58,908 --> 00:21:01,308
(If he knew you and understood you, )

217
00:21:01,388 --> 00:21:02,998
(of course it wouldn't be an issue.)

218
00:21:03,297 --> 00:21:06,857
But your mindset is too weird.

219
00:21:06,954 --> 00:21:09,124
I don't think he can understand it.

220
00:21:27,837 --> 00:21:29,517
Zheng Shu Yi, I...

221
00:21:29,628 --> 00:21:33,623
I want to publish my digital magazine in the new year

222
00:21:33,727 --> 00:21:36,439
so that I write more articles that are even better!

223
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:49,002
(Typing...)

224
00:21:49,829 --> 00:21:51,229
She's still awake.

225
00:21:52,838 --> 00:21:54,638
(Thank you for celebrating New Year with me.)

226
00:21:54,668 --> 00:21:57,479
(May all your wishes come true in this new year too.)

227
00:22:00,533 --> 00:22:03,264
This sounds too courteous.

228
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:08,429
(Why are you still awake?)

229
00:22:12,646 --> 00:22:15,516
(I'm going to sleep soon. Happy New Year.)

230
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,399
Happy New Year.

231
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:34,159
(Professor Yu, what is your plan for today?)

232
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:39,829
Qin Shi Yue. Hurry up and get changed. We are going to the horse ranch.

233
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:41,021
No.

234
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,344
No?

235
00:22:44,228 --> 00:22:45,919
I have things to do. I'm not going.

236
00:22:56,668 --> 00:22:59,108
This is the only place that's free of people during the holiday.

237
00:22:59,132 --> 00:23:01,723
Luckily, Guan Xiang Cheng is your old friend.

238
00:23:02,349 --> 00:23:03,892
After coming here with Shi Yan last time,

239
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:06,189
Uncle Guan has been asking me to come here again.

240
00:23:11,918 --> 00:23:13,608
Is it just the two of us today?

241
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,042
I think so. Let's go.

242
00:23:22,095 --> 00:23:23,292
Where's Yue?

243
00:23:23,717 --> 00:23:26,717
She said that she was busy. She refused to come and kept holding her phone.

244
00:23:27,774 --> 00:23:29,202
That little girl has grown up.

245
00:23:29,468 --> 00:23:30,868
I think it's a serious matter.

246
00:23:35,468 --> 00:23:36,868
How did the inspection go?

247
00:23:37,878 --> 00:23:40,184
We have to join the battery industry.

248
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:43,359
But Zhanlan is not a good entry point.

249
00:23:45,464 --> 00:23:46,864
Since you've made up your mind,

250
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:49,108
why do you still look so distracted?

251
00:23:53,175 --> 00:23:54,575
There has been more trouble lately.

252
00:23:54,887 --> 00:23:56,487
So, I went to the mountain some time ago

253
00:23:56,589 --> 00:23:57,892
to ask for some blessings.

254
00:23:57,983 --> 00:23:59,383
Here's one for you.

255
00:24:01,029 --> 00:24:02,429
You believe in this?

256
00:24:03,215 --> 00:24:05,588
No matter what, it's just for peace of mind.

257
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:07,007
In this industry,

258
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,480
it's like sitting on a roller coaster every day.

259
00:24:12,069 --> 00:24:13,959
The law of attraction.

260
00:24:14,892 --> 00:24:16,012
Something like that.

261
00:24:16,148 --> 00:24:18,789
You'll attract what you think of.

262
00:24:22,827 --> 00:24:24,397
That one is so red.

263
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,642
Shu Yi.

264
00:24:29,327 --> 00:24:30,727
Shi Yan.

265
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:32,669
What's wrong with Shi Yan?

266
00:25:07,707 --> 00:25:09,322
Let's go and greet them.

267
00:25:10,126 --> 00:25:11,282
Okay.

268
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:20,268
It's an honor to have two journalists on our horse ranch today.

269
00:25:20,868 --> 00:25:22,229
This is a sudden visit.

270
00:25:22,309 --> 00:25:23,644
We didn't know that you would be here.

271
00:25:23,668 --> 00:25:24,989
We'll not disturb you further.

272
00:25:25,092 --> 00:25:26,352
You are not a disturbance.

273
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,753
This is fate. Great minds think alike.

274
00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:31,348
Since you are here

275
00:25:31,428 --> 00:25:32,525
and this horse ranch is so big,

276
00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:33,949
you won't disturb us.

277
00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:35,709
Just go and have fun.

278
00:25:37,749 --> 00:25:39,549
Miss Bi, this is your first time here, right?

279
00:25:39,589 --> 00:25:42,259
Maybe I can show you around.

280
00:25:45,428 --> 00:25:46,988
Thank you for the offer then, Mr. Guan.

281
00:26:03,868 --> 00:26:05,518
You are a busy person.

282
00:26:05,868 --> 00:26:08,068
How long has it been since the last time you were here?

283
00:26:09,789 --> 00:26:12,749
My friend gave me a pure-bred Mongolian horse recently.

284
00:26:12,829 --> 00:26:14,029
It's gentle and docile.

285
00:26:14,109 --> 00:26:15,558
You can ride it later.

286
00:26:16,188 --> 00:26:17,388
Sure.

287
00:26:17,468 --> 00:26:18,879
I haven't been here in a long time.

288
00:26:19,148 --> 00:26:20,798
I'm going to ride as much as I can today.

289
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,709
Guan Ji and Shi Yan are here with their friends again.

290
00:26:32,109 --> 00:26:33,509
Come. Let's go and meet them.

291
00:26:34,868 --> 00:26:36,122
I think

292
00:26:36,549 --> 00:26:37,949
that's Shu Yi.

293
00:26:41,959 --> 00:26:44,442
Isn't that great? All of you know each other.

294
00:26:46,989 --> 00:26:49,189
It looks like they are having fun.

295
00:26:49,315 --> 00:26:50,789
If we suddenly approach them,

296
00:26:50,885 --> 00:26:52,868
I'm afraid that we'll disturb them.

297
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,000
You are right.

298
00:27:01,462 --> 00:27:02,862
We can

299
00:27:03,301 --> 00:27:04,701
let them have the ranch then.

300
00:27:04,868 --> 00:27:07,429
Let me take you to the winery to taste our newly imported wine.

301
00:27:08,325 --> 00:27:10,496
Sure. I'll come back next time.

302
00:27:10,589 --> 00:27:13,038
You are welcome at any time. Come. This way.

303
00:27:15,861 --> 00:27:17,261
I read

304
00:27:17,468 --> 00:27:19,531
the article that you wrote for my dad not long ago.

305
00:27:19,868 --> 00:27:21,268
It was very well written.

306
00:27:21,647 --> 00:27:23,367
It makes me want to get interviewed by you.

307
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:28,962
But I'm not successful enough yet.

308
00:27:29,309 --> 00:27:30,709
I still need to work harder.

309
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,589
You are too kind, Mr. Guan.

310
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,920
Uncle Guan was the real winner.

311
00:27:34,948 --> 00:27:37,389
I just put his words into writing.

312
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,160
I'm not just being kind.

313
00:27:40,388 --> 00:27:41,989
You managed to handle Shi Yan.

314
00:27:42,069 --> 00:27:43,838
And that was not an easy feat.

315
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,800
Let's take a look over there.

316
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,160
It's dirty in the stable.

317
00:28:14,284 --> 00:28:15,484
Wait for me here.

318
00:28:15,549 --> 00:28:16,949
I'll get the horses for you.

319
00:28:39,388 --> 00:28:40,588
Don't be afraid.

320
00:28:40,668 --> 00:28:41,868
This horse is very docile.

321
00:28:41,948 --> 00:28:43,998
That's an act of affection.

322
00:28:44,582 --> 00:28:45,982
An act of affection?

323
00:28:47,829 --> 00:28:49,798
It depends on who's riding it.

324
00:28:51,789 --> 00:28:54,108
Dou Dou, be good to me this time.

325
00:28:54,188 --> 00:28:55,392
Please.

326
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,280
This horse has been close to me since I was young.

327
00:29:07,309 --> 00:29:09,535
It behaves itself even more around a beautiful lady.

328
00:29:12,069 --> 00:29:13,669
I purposely selected this horse for you.

329
00:29:14,188 --> 00:29:15,318
Trust me.

330
00:29:15,668 --> 00:29:17,068
I'll protect you.

331
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,920
I'll leave my safety in your hands then.

332
00:29:25,415 --> 00:29:26,815
Strap them on with their saddle.

333
00:29:28,868 --> 00:29:29,961
Go.

334
00:29:36,695 --> 00:29:38,295
You can head to the changing room first.

335
00:29:38,388 --> 00:29:39,788
I'm here to have fun today.

336
00:29:39,908 --> 00:29:41,308
I'm free.

337
00:29:41,428 --> 00:29:42,828
So, I can teach you how to ride.

338
00:29:45,309 --> 00:29:46,709
Are you that free?

339
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,880
Why are you here?

340
00:30:00,317 --> 00:30:02,128
This ranch doesn't belong to you.

341
00:30:06,148 --> 00:30:08,114
But I can keep you out of here.

342
00:30:10,188 --> 00:30:11,888
That joke is not funny at all.

343
00:30:11,979 --> 00:30:14,630
Since you are Shi Yan's friend, you are my friend too.

344
00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:16,988
Just treat this as your own home and have fun.

345
00:30:17,109 --> 00:30:18,363
Is that so?

346
00:30:19,148 --> 00:30:21,068
When have we become that close?

347
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,470
Yes. We don't know each other well.

348
00:30:30,982 --> 00:30:32,602
I shouldn't trouble you like this.

349
00:30:33,229 --> 00:30:34,553
It's no trouble at all.

350
00:30:34,806 --> 00:30:36,509
Since you are invited by my dad,

351
00:30:36,589 --> 00:30:38,148
I have to take good care of you.

352
00:30:38,228 --> 00:30:40,308
Let's go. I'll take you to the changing room.

353
00:30:40,388 --> 00:30:41,788
Thank you, Mr. Guan.

354
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,239
(I'm invited by Mr. Guan.)

355
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,518
(What can you do about it?)

356
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,690
What's going on between you and Shi Yan?

357
00:31:00,453 --> 00:31:02,102
I don't know what's wrong with him.

358
00:31:02,534 --> 00:31:03,934
I was so sure...

359
00:31:04,334 --> 00:31:07,206
From what you told me yesterday, you were one step away.

360
00:31:07,727 --> 00:31:11,057
But from what I saw just now, looks like you still have a long way to go.

361
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:14,922
- I don't know. - Don't mess it up.

362
00:31:15,188 --> 00:31:18,119
I can tell that he cares about you.

363
00:31:22,388 --> 00:31:24,690
The clothes are ready. You can go in and get changed.

364
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,769
What were you doing just now?

365
00:31:38,255 --> 00:31:40,015
They are here on a holiday

366
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:41,506
and they have not offended you.

367
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,285
One even wrote an article to compliment you.

368
00:31:43,309 --> 00:31:44,709
What are you pulling a long face

369
00:31:44,789 --> 00:31:46,189
as if someone has offended you?

370
00:31:48,749 --> 00:31:50,774
Stop doing that when they come out later.

371
00:31:50,905 --> 00:31:52,355
Ride a few rounds with them

372
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:54,084
to get along with them.

373
00:32:02,485 --> 00:32:04,804
Shi Yan is a man after all.

374
00:32:04,908 --> 00:32:07,838
Maybe he's angry that you didn't tell him about coming here to the ranch.

375
00:32:08,005 --> 00:32:10,628
But if he's angry, it means that he cares about you.

376
00:32:10,708 --> 00:32:13,442
When he has calmed down, show him your soft side,

377
00:32:13,526 --> 00:32:15,136
and he'll be yours.

378
00:32:15,695 --> 00:32:17,464
Will that work?

379
00:32:30,509 --> 00:32:31,998
Why aren't they out yet?

380
00:32:36,068 --> 00:32:37,311
Shi Yan.

381
00:32:59,542 --> 00:33:00,942
This is bad.

382
00:33:01,109 --> 00:33:03,639
Shu Yi. I didn't know that Shi Yan was standing outside.

383
00:33:03,871 --> 00:33:06,871
Okay. I'll get changed at once and explain it to him.

384
00:33:06,952 --> 00:33:08,802
I'll tell him that we were just joking.

385
00:33:08,908 --> 00:33:10,118
It's okay.

386
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:13,372
People only want to believe in what they believe in.

387
00:33:13,589 --> 00:33:15,108
If he believes me,

388
00:33:15,188 --> 00:33:16,802
he'll ask me himself.

389
00:33:17,708 --> 00:33:19,868
If he wants to believe what he hears,

390
00:33:19,948 --> 00:33:21,708
there's no use for you to explain it to him.

391
00:33:21,904 --> 00:33:24,042
But I still have to explain it to him.

392
00:33:24,188 --> 00:33:26,548
Otherwise, how can take your relationship to the next step?

393
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,423
If someone doesn't want to take the next step with you,

394
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,381
it doesn't matter if he has heard something or not.

395
00:33:34,908 --> 00:33:36,758
He'll just think

396
00:33:36,908 --> 00:33:38,802
that both of you are not meant to be together.

397
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,770
When I think about it,

398
00:33:40,948 --> 00:33:42,996
we haven't known each other for long.

399
00:33:43,868 --> 00:33:45,518
I don't know him at all.

400
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,611
For me, he's like a kite.

401
00:33:49,271 --> 00:33:51,671
One moment, he's close. And the next, he's far away from me.

402
00:33:52,309 --> 00:33:54,159
I don't understand him at all.

403
00:34:01,468 --> 00:34:02,765
Shu...

404
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:27,548
You are not wearing your scarf right.

405
00:34:42,335 --> 00:34:43,636
Thank you.

406
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,082
Where's Miss Zheng?

407
00:35:09,989 --> 00:35:11,839
We just messaged each other yesterday.

408
00:35:11,989 --> 00:35:13,762
How can you say that we are not close?

409
00:35:24,176 --> 00:35:25,576
Say something.

410
00:35:52,907 --> 00:35:55,518
(What's the meaning of that?)

411
00:36:10,628 --> 00:36:12,322
What took you so long?

412
00:36:12,668 --> 00:36:14,068
Is Miss Zheng not ready yet?

413
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,520
Shu Yi does things very slowly.

414
00:36:21,668 --> 00:36:23,628
How about we wait for her while we go for a ride?

415
00:36:27,949 --> 00:36:29,839
I'll go for a ride with Miss Bi then.

416
00:36:36,668 --> 00:36:38,118
It's beautiful.

417
00:36:39,625 --> 00:36:40,985
You think it's beautiful?

418
00:36:41,148 --> 00:36:42,316
Yes.

419
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,360
This is the first time someone compliments Qing Yun with that adjective.

420
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,025
Qing Yun?

421
00:36:50,869 --> 00:36:52,439
Why is it called Qing Yun?

422
00:36:53,995 --> 00:36:56,845
Its eyes are not green in color too.

423
00:36:59,549 --> 00:37:00,949
You'll find out later.

424
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,402
Get on.

425
00:37:21,709 --> 00:37:23,109
Don't be nervous.

426
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,960
Hold on to the saddle.

427
00:37:26,774 --> 00:37:28,494
Don't sway your body to the left and right.

428
00:37:29,549 --> 00:37:30,949
Relax your thighs.

429
00:37:31,109 --> 00:37:33,479
Don't squeeze with your knees and calves.

430
00:37:33,589 --> 00:37:35,588
Just let them drape lightly on Qing Yun's body.

431
00:37:49,067 --> 00:37:50,280
Guan Ji.

432
00:37:59,268 --> 00:38:00,998
Why do you like riding a horse?

433
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,710
Because I like the feeling of freedom.

434
00:38:06,069 --> 00:38:07,203
It's freeing

435
00:38:07,469 --> 00:38:08,959
and it feels like flying.

436
00:38:11,279 --> 00:38:12,679
I like being free too.

437
00:38:16,748 --> 00:38:18,439
If you like riding,

438
00:38:18,549 --> 00:38:19,949
you can come here often.

439
00:38:49,668 --> 00:38:51,279
Slow down!

440
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,489
Slow down!

441
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,550
Slow down!

442
00:39:00,148 --> 00:39:01,477
Get on.

443
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:04,482
I'll pass.

444
00:39:04,582 --> 00:39:06,943
I'm just here today to relax.

445
00:39:07,031 --> 00:39:08,431
I'm not here to ride a horse.

446
00:39:09,574 --> 00:39:11,934
Are you going to get on or do you want me to do it for you?

447
00:39:13,542 --> 00:39:16,082
Why isn't there a normal option for me?

448
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,039
You can carry me then.

449
00:39:21,148 --> 00:39:22,548
I want the Princess Carry.

450
00:39:32,909 --> 00:39:34,998
I wouldn't trouble you like that.

451
00:39:35,148 --> 00:39:36,839
I'll get on myself.

452
00:40:07,589 --> 00:40:10,558
(Being silent is Shi Yan's true color.)

453
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,257
Your posture is not right. Sit up straight.

454
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,489
The sunset is beautiful.

455
00:40:58,151 --> 00:40:59,921
But it marks the end of the day.

456
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,880
Dou Dou is so obedient today.

457
00:41:29,971 --> 00:41:32,381
It's more docile compared to my first time with it.

458
00:41:33,573 --> 00:41:35,263
It didn't know you at that time.

459
00:41:35,469 --> 00:41:37,078
That was why it gave you an attitude.

460
00:41:39,188 --> 00:41:40,588
What about you, Miss Zheng?

461
00:41:41,205 --> 00:41:43,795
You insisted on coming to the ranch with me on the first interview.

462
00:41:43,819 --> 00:41:45,948
You tried so hard to approach me.

463
00:41:46,711 --> 00:41:48,038
Why?

464
00:41:49,557 --> 00:41:51,499
(So, he heard what we said.)

465
00:41:54,781 --> 00:41:57,962
At first, I just wanted to interview you.

466
00:41:58,069 --> 00:41:59,548
Yunchuang was so full of potential

467
00:41:59,628 --> 00:42:01,197
and you were so mysterious.

468
00:42:01,316 --> 00:42:03,479
That exclusive interview was crucial for me.

469
00:42:04,614 --> 00:42:06,014
At first?

470
00:42:07,888 --> 00:42:09,288
What about after that?
