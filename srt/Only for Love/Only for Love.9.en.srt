1
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:36,095
(Only for Love)

2
00:01:36,176 --> 00:01:39,122
(Episode 9)

3
00:01:40,126 --> 00:01:41,766
Greetings, everyone.

4
00:01:41,846 --> 00:01:43,007
Sorry to keep you all waiting.

5
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:44,408
I'm Shi Yan.

6
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:57,197
Welcome to Mingyu Yunchuang Annual Strategy Conference.

7
00:01:57,486 --> 00:02:00,236
Shi Yan has really made a name for himself in the past few years.

8
00:02:00,406 --> 00:02:02,247
The father and son of the Shi family are really smart.

9
00:02:02,374 --> 00:02:05,404
When he left, Shi Yan was relieved of a great burden.

10
00:02:05,607 --> 00:02:08,797
This launch event is clearly the idea of the younger generation.

11
00:02:14,887 --> 00:02:16,067
Yue,

12
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:18,882
are you feeling unwell?

13
00:02:20,863 --> 00:02:22,322
I'm fine.

14
00:02:22,526 --> 00:02:24,396
If you don't feel comfortable, just tell me.

15
00:02:24,526 --> 00:02:26,882
Are you not used to this kind of occasion?

16
00:02:26,963 --> 00:02:28,527
Are you feeling a bit short of breath?

17
00:02:30,956 --> 00:02:32,642
Mr. Shi is always looking at me.

18
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:34,242
I'm a bit scared.

19
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:42,188
Don't be nervous. He's looking at me.

20
00:02:44,646 --> 00:02:46,602
(She's quite confident.)

21
00:03:25,935 --> 00:03:29,135
This year, Yunchuang has also joined hands with many new partners.

22
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,195
They all come from new industry lines

23
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:34,273
and have innovative spirits and a sense of social responsibility.

24
00:03:34,354 --> 00:03:35,842
We truly look forward to it.

25
00:03:37,047 --> 00:03:39,156
Shi Yan is talking about Le'an.

26
00:03:39,287 --> 00:03:42,227
Mingyu Yunchuang has invested in many tech companies this year.

27
00:03:42,438 --> 00:03:44,549
Tech companies carry a high risk.

28
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:48,202
But once it succeeds, the return is very high.

29
00:03:48,432 --> 00:03:50,062
Shi Yan is very smart.

30
00:03:50,305 --> 00:03:51,985
He uses the way of introducing technology experts

31
00:03:52,143 --> 00:03:54,877
to get more shares with the least amount of money.

32
00:03:55,567 --> 00:03:58,882
He has something to it.

33
00:03:59,225 --> 00:04:01,122
The younger generation's ability is to be reckoned with.

34
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:11,910
Shu Yi, I'm a bit short of breath.

35
00:04:12,064 --> 00:04:13,782
Can I go out and get some fresh air?

36
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:15,637
Go quickly. Don't go too far.

37
00:04:27,174 --> 00:04:28,432
The presentation is halfway done.

38
00:04:28,513 --> 00:04:31,155
I'll give everyone some time to absorb and digest

39
00:04:31,236 --> 00:04:33,126
the information presented in the first half of the session.

40
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:35,447
Please also have some refreshments.

41
00:04:35,527 --> 00:04:37,682
More information will be disclosed in the second half of the session.

42
00:04:45,904 --> 00:04:48,122
He's very charming on stage.

43
00:04:53,446 --> 00:04:54,626
Mr. Shi.

44
00:04:55,886 --> 00:04:57,066
Hello, Mr. Wang.

45
00:05:00,246 --> 00:05:02,276
Are you a journalist from Financial Introduce?

46
00:05:03,527 --> 00:05:04,647
Yes, and you are?

47
00:05:04,727 --> 00:05:06,246
I'm a journalist from Jiangcheng Daily.

48
00:05:06,326 --> 00:05:08,467
I used to intern at Financial Introduce.

49
00:05:09,047 --> 00:05:10,602
What a coincidence.

50
00:05:10,806 --> 00:05:13,857
The head of the special coverage team back then was Tang Yi.

51
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,180
Do you know her?

52
00:05:15,287 --> 00:05:16,687
She's my superior now.

53
00:05:16,845 --> 00:05:17,884
That's even more coincidental.

54
00:05:17,992 --> 00:05:19,757
My name is He Bo Ming. What about you?

55
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,402
My name is Zheng Shu Yi.

56
00:05:21,686 --> 00:05:22,726
Let's add each other on WeChat

57
00:05:22,806 --> 00:05:24,527
so we can communicate more in the future.

58
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,707
Sure.

59
00:05:26,552 --> 00:05:28,372
- Scan my code.   - All right.

60
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,242
Miss Zheng Shu Yi.

61
00:05:40,727 --> 00:05:42,082
Please come over here.

62
00:05:43,607 --> 00:05:44,946
He asked you to come.

63
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,270
So, you two know each other?

64
00:05:51,246 --> 00:05:53,716
(Shi Yan is jealous.)

65
00:05:53,806 --> 00:05:55,356
(He's not happy!)

66
00:06:02,486 --> 00:06:03,667
Mr. Shi.

67
00:06:04,326 --> 00:06:05,707
Is there anything I can help?

68
00:06:18,735 --> 00:06:21,285
Is there anything I can help you with?

69
00:06:23,647 --> 00:06:25,107
You...

70
00:06:29,326 --> 00:06:30,916
Where is that female journalist next to you?

71
00:06:32,847 --> 00:06:35,746
The female journalist who came with you. Where did she go?

72
00:06:36,967 --> 00:06:40,244
(You called me over to ask about Qin Shi Yue.)

73
00:06:41,047 --> 00:06:43,317
(He was really looking at Qin Shi Yue just now?)

74
00:06:44,967 --> 00:06:46,046
Are you looking for her?

75
00:06:46,126 --> 00:06:47,547
She just went out.

76
00:06:47,972 --> 00:06:49,962
Do you need me to help you contact her?

77
00:06:59,365 --> 00:07:02,435
(Don't answer.)

78
00:07:10,646 --> 00:07:11,766
Oh no!

79
00:07:11,847 --> 00:07:13,877
Do I have to be taken back so soon?

80
00:07:24,748 --> 00:07:27,442
Hey, Yue. Where are you?

81
00:07:27,929 --> 00:07:29,569
(I'm in the lobby outside.)

82
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,122
(I haven't gone far.)

83
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,999
Do you want me to go back?

84
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,866
You don't feel well and have already gone home?

85
00:07:39,366 --> 00:07:40,626
I haven't left.

86
00:07:40,776 --> 00:07:43,875
It's okay. No need to come back.

87
00:07:44,326 --> 00:07:47,087
- Shu Yi, what are you talking about?   - (Take care of your health.)

88
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:49,087
Rest well. I'm hanging up.

89
00:07:49,167 --> 00:07:50,426
I...

90
00:07:56,575 --> 00:07:58,804
Mr. Shi, she has already left.

91
00:07:59,167 --> 00:08:00,426
Where did she go?

92
00:08:00,999 --> 00:08:02,839
(It's none of your business.)

93
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,989
She was not feeling well, so she went home.

94
00:08:06,047 --> 00:08:07,386
How is she feeling unwell?

95
00:08:08,206 --> 00:08:10,127
(What does it have to do with you?)

96
00:08:10,207 --> 00:08:12,007
She has a CEO phobia.

97
00:08:12,087 --> 00:08:13,186
What?

98
00:08:13,886 --> 00:08:15,445
When she sees someone like you, a big shot,

99
00:08:15,526 --> 00:08:18,026
she can't breathe and will experience chest tightness.

100
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,379
I'm different.

101
00:08:20,527 --> 00:08:24,156
When I see you, I'm ecstatic, excited, and happy.

102
00:08:34,726 --> 00:08:36,946
Mr. Shi, the second half of the session is starting.

103
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:50,396
(Am I playing the female supporting role who is just the cannon fodder?)

104
00:09:09,767 --> 00:09:11,357
What's going on?

105
00:09:11,726 --> 00:09:13,066
Give me back my coffee.

106
00:09:33,514 --> 00:09:35,042
Thanks.

107
00:10:10,864 --> 00:10:12,865
Absolute top-notch stock.

108
00:10:12,976 --> 00:10:15,286
You won't lose in any circumstances.

109
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:19,510
The only thing is that I must be able to buy this stock.

110
00:10:26,527 --> 00:10:28,042
Welcome back. In the second half,

111
00:10:28,123 --> 00:10:31,706
I will introduce several important partners of Yunchuang to everyone.

112
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,799
Next, I will announce a news that is extremely important

113
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:37,741
and of great significance to Yunchuang.

114
00:10:42,287 --> 00:10:45,360
Guan Capital will officially invest in Mingyu Yunchuang,

115
00:10:45,456 --> 00:10:48,316
becoming an important partner of Mingyu Yunchuang in the future.

116
00:10:48,409 --> 00:10:49,425
Now, let's invite

117
00:10:49,506 --> 00:10:51,747
Guan Capital's Strategic Consultant Yu You to come on stage

118
00:10:51,828 --> 00:10:53,228
and present to us

119
00:10:53,367 --> 00:10:55,477
the future of Yunchuang and Guan Capital.

120
00:11:01,967 --> 00:11:03,146
Thank you, Mr. Shi.

121
00:11:10,815 --> 00:11:12,136
Guan Capital is determined to

122
00:11:12,247 --> 00:11:14,407
devote itself to innovation and talent introduction.

123
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,774
In the future, Guan Capital will also continue to

124
00:11:16,855 --> 00:11:19,726
focus on technological innovation together with Yunchuang.

125
00:11:19,806 --> 00:11:21,447
Under the new economy,

126
00:11:21,527 --> 00:11:24,167
the traditional financial model and the old pattern of interests

127
00:11:24,247 --> 00:11:25,962
will gradually undergo earth-shattering changes.

128
00:11:26,407 --> 00:11:29,047
Many companies are exploring innovative models,

129
00:11:29,127 --> 00:11:31,927
but they easily get stuck in their thinking and can't look at the problem

130
00:11:32,007 --> 00:11:33,676
from outside their own company and industry.

131
00:11:34,647 --> 00:11:35,907
It's him?

132
00:11:36,047 --> 00:11:38,117
(It's an honor for me to join Guan Capital)

133
00:11:38,287 --> 00:11:40,202
(and witness their breakthrough development.)

134
00:11:43,047 --> 00:11:44,466
(He's still looking.)

135
00:11:45,086 --> 00:11:46,586
(He's still looking!)

136
00:11:46,926 --> 00:11:48,957
(He's too bold, isn't he?)

137
00:12:05,806 --> 00:12:07,167
Thank you all for coming.

138
00:12:07,247 --> 00:12:08,327
I hope Mingyu Yunchuang,

139
00:12:08,407 --> 00:12:11,006
together with Guan Capital, can join hands, climb together,

140
00:12:11,086 --> 00:12:12,885
and continue to write a new chapter for the industry.

141
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:15,682
I announce the end of this press conference.

142
00:12:23,574 --> 00:12:26,175
Mr. Shi, what are your thoughts on this conference?

143
00:12:26,263 --> 00:12:29,482
Mr. Shi, what do you think Yunchuang's future investment direction will be?

144
00:12:32,239 --> 00:12:34,458
Shu Yi. I have something to do. I'm leaving first.

145
00:12:36,926 --> 00:12:39,886
I have something to do at the office. I'm leaving.

146
00:12:39,966 --> 00:12:40,966
Okay.

147
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:49,646
I'm personally very satisfied with this press conference.

148
00:12:49,726 --> 00:12:52,196
I also want to thank everyone for coming.

149
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,490
Do you have any other questions?

150
00:13:13,176 --> 00:13:14,216
You guys are done?

151
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,466
Just finished.

152
00:13:22,007 --> 00:13:24,167
(Shu Yi, I want to ask.)

153
00:13:24,247 --> 00:13:26,997
(Who is the person who spoke on stage just now?)

154
00:13:27,184 --> 00:13:28,703
Of course, it was Shi Yan.

155
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:30,590
Did you not wake up?

156
00:13:32,798 --> 00:13:35,766
Why does everybody just focus on Uncle?

157
00:13:35,846 --> 00:13:39,196
Could it be that only I saw the other handsome and elegant speaker?

158
00:13:40,007 --> 00:13:41,267
Qin Shi Yue.

159
00:13:46,846 --> 00:13:48,186
How are you feeling unwell?

160
00:13:49,127 --> 00:13:52,597
No. I'm not feeling unwell.

161
00:13:52,956 --> 00:13:55,246
It's your first press conference and you're already slacking off.

162
00:13:55,349 --> 00:13:56,369
Qin Shi Yue.

163
00:13:56,726 --> 00:13:58,226
Are you waiting to be beaten?

164
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:02,606
Uncle, can you please back off?

165
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,730
I know I'm wrong, okay?

166
00:14:07,941 --> 00:14:11,921
I think you want to work with me and report directly to me, right?

167
00:14:12,915 --> 00:14:14,156
I don't dare to do this anymore.

168
00:14:14,251 --> 00:14:16,751
I'll definitely work hard in the future. No more slacking off.

169
00:14:16,887 --> 00:14:19,186
Uncle, please forgive me. Will you?

170
00:14:19,606 --> 00:14:20,747
Will you?

171
00:14:30,128 --> 00:14:32,005
(There are so many people here.)

172
00:14:32,086 --> 00:14:35,117
(Shi Yan, you actually dare to flirt with a woman in broad daylight?)

173
00:14:36,388 --> 00:14:38,402
(Won't you feel ashamed?)

174
00:14:38,485 --> 00:14:40,396
(Can't you wait any longer?)

175
00:14:47,247 --> 00:14:49,980
If you don't want my identity exposed to my superior,

176
00:14:50,061 --> 00:14:51,736
let me go immediately.

177
00:15:00,885 --> 00:15:02,086
I have something to do. I'm leaving.

178
00:15:02,181 --> 00:15:04,637
I'm inviting you for dinner next week. Let's arrange an interview then.

179
00:15:08,803 --> 00:15:10,044
You scared her away.

180
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,585
She saw you and ran.

181
00:15:11,846 --> 00:15:13,477
What did she say to you?

182
00:15:15,221 --> 00:15:18,090
She asked me for an interview and dinner.

183
00:15:41,558 --> 00:15:43,737
And then, he just let me leave like that.

184
00:15:45,192 --> 00:15:47,071
Zheng Shu Yi.

185
00:15:47,206 --> 00:15:49,006
No matter how good your article is,

186
00:15:49,086 --> 00:15:51,036
you're still beaten by the intern.

187
00:15:51,446 --> 00:15:53,796
Well, wise men don't enter the river of love.

188
00:16:16,926 --> 00:16:20,436
(You can't expect me to start talking first. It's impossible.)

189
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:23,242
(Shi Yan, you can forget about it.)

190
00:16:35,767 --> 00:16:37,517
Why are you standing there?

191
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,024
Praying.

192
00:16:50,606 --> 00:16:51,747
I'm leaving.

193
00:16:52,446 --> 00:16:53,907
Take it easy. I'm not seeing you off.

194
00:17:00,176 --> 00:17:01,642
I'm taking you home.

195
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,144
Hello.

196
00:17:12,562 --> 00:17:13,782
It's you.

197
00:17:14,188 --> 00:17:15,188
Hello.

198
00:17:21,287 --> 00:17:22,482
Waiting for a ride?

199
00:17:22,684 --> 00:17:23,765
Yeah.

200
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,455
There are too many people taking taxis. I've been waiting for half a day.

201
00:17:34,517 --> 00:17:36,307
I bought an extra can. Have some.

202
00:17:40,141 --> 00:17:42,091
Thanks.

203
00:17:45,012 --> 00:17:46,921
My ride is here. I'm leaving first.

204
00:17:47,072 --> 00:17:49,162
- Goodbye.   - Goodbye.

205
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:16,167
(You don't reply to my text messages.)

206
00:18:16,247 --> 00:18:18,127
(You ignore my friendly gestures.)

207
00:18:18,207 --> 00:18:20,006
(Instead, you go and flirt with someone)

208
00:18:20,093 --> 00:18:22,004
(who gets nervous and starts to sweat when she sees you.)

209
00:18:22,111 --> 00:18:23,242
(Am I not pretty enough?)

210
00:18:23,366 --> 00:18:24,787
(Am I not trying hard enough?)

211
00:18:25,047 --> 00:18:29,987
(Or is it that CEOs like women who are scared of them?)

212
00:18:30,326 --> 00:18:32,346
(Cliché. What a bad taste.)

213
00:18:38,646 --> 00:18:40,876
(But I can't really blame him for anything, can I?)

214
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:42,917
(It's clearly me who is pursuing him.)

215
00:18:43,132 --> 00:18:45,122
(And he didn't promise anything either.)

216
00:18:48,846 --> 00:18:51,397
A play of emotions with eight ups and downs.

217
00:18:52,927 --> 00:18:54,066
What?

218
00:18:55,727 --> 00:18:57,437
I said it would rain at 8 o'clock tonight.

219
00:19:01,264 --> 00:19:02,894
Will you hold an umbrella for me then?

220
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:14,227
Hello.

221
00:19:14,927 --> 00:19:16,106
Say it.

222
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:43,796
I got it. Let's just leave it at that. Bye.

223
00:20:30,846 --> 00:20:32,636
Okay, just leave it at that. Bye.

224
00:21:11,207 --> 00:21:13,556
Why have I fallen asleep in your car again?

225
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,680
You must have waited for me for a long time.

226
00:21:15,767 --> 00:21:18,386
Why didn't you wake me up when we reached?

227
00:21:19,219 --> 00:21:20,399
We just reached.

228
00:21:27,646 --> 00:21:28,747
Are you jealous?

229
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,794
I mean,

230
00:21:32,967 --> 00:21:36,286
if you have time, I'd like to invite you for a meal.

231
00:21:36,467 --> 00:21:38,298
I'd like to thank you for sending me home today.

232
00:21:41,222 --> 00:21:45,482
Actually, I have something to talk to you about.

233
00:21:46,489 --> 00:21:49,507
It's the special coverage I mentioned to you last time.

234
00:21:54,082 --> 00:21:56,207
If you want to make an appointment with me,

235
00:21:56,287 --> 00:21:57,787
you can contact Chen Sheng for the time.

236
00:21:58,806 --> 00:22:00,145
I still have something to do.

237
00:22:04,951 --> 00:22:06,417
Thanks for sending me home, Mr. Shi.

238
00:22:06,498 --> 00:22:08,042
I'll get out of the car first.

239
00:22:25,356 --> 00:22:27,326
(The atmosphere was so good just now.)

240
00:22:27,406 --> 00:22:29,997
(Why did I bring up the special coverage?)

241
00:22:57,774 --> 00:22:58,873
Let's go.

242
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:06,002
No, that's not right.

243
00:23:06,163 --> 00:23:08,522
Yunchuang and here are two different directions.

244
00:23:08,639 --> 00:23:10,909
He's so busy yet he still sent me home.

245
00:23:12,126 --> 00:23:13,779
He was busy all day with the press conference,

246
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,090
and he still took the time to send me home.

247
00:23:16,927 --> 00:23:18,836
Actually, he's quite considerate.

248
00:23:23,007 --> 00:23:24,647
Hi, guys. Came out for a walk?

249
00:23:24,727 --> 00:23:26,362
The puppy is so cute.

250
00:23:27,676 --> 00:23:29,982
- Who is she?   - I don't know her.

251
00:23:40,955 --> 00:23:42,056
Wait.

252
00:23:42,976 --> 00:23:46,147
He took me home

253
00:23:46,618 --> 00:23:49,202
after flirting with Qin Shi Yue.

254
00:23:50,714 --> 00:23:53,545
It's obvious he was two-timing us.

255
00:23:58,201 --> 00:23:59,720
I'm so mad!

256
00:23:59,886 --> 00:24:01,677
I'm so mad!

257
00:24:10,046 --> 00:24:11,185
Forget it.

258
00:24:11,646 --> 00:24:13,717
I'm not a good person either.

259
00:24:14,406 --> 00:24:16,677
I have my own ulterior motives for him.

260
00:24:17,527 --> 00:24:19,757
What right do I have to demand anything from him?

261
00:24:21,542 --> 00:24:23,811
That's right. That's how it is.

262
00:24:27,381 --> 00:24:28,562
No, that's not right.

263
00:24:29,126 --> 00:24:31,356
Although I have ulterior motives for him,

264
00:24:31,781 --> 00:24:33,811
I don't flirt with anyone else.

265
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:37,060
I'm devoted to him in this relationship, all right?

266
00:25:34,134 --> 00:25:35,134
Hey.

267
00:25:35,215 --> 00:25:36,762
- (Want to go out for drinks?)   - No.

268
00:25:36,876 --> 00:25:38,056
No.

269
00:25:39,047 --> 00:25:40,267
No?

270
00:25:57,163 --> 00:25:58,479
What are you thinking?

271
00:26:01,767 --> 00:26:05,682
I'm thinking you can't marry a man not as good as me.

272
00:26:07,927 --> 00:26:09,006
Then, I'll marry you.

273
00:26:09,117 --> 00:26:10,337
Okay.

274
00:26:14,727 --> 00:26:16,276
Nonsense.

275
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:18,689
For people like us who only love freedom,

276
00:26:19,421 --> 00:26:21,571
how can there be a day for marriage for us?

277
00:26:45,351 --> 00:26:48,036
(I don't even know how to contact that person.)

278
00:26:48,126 --> 00:26:50,556
(Asking Uncle won't work, right?)

279
00:26:50,886 --> 00:26:52,796
(That petty Shi Yan.)

280
00:26:53,126 --> 00:26:54,386
(What a pig.)

281
00:26:54,727 --> 00:26:56,316
Why is he so fond of putting on airs?

282
00:26:56,927 --> 00:26:59,122
And he wants me to make an appointment with Chen Sheng?

283
00:27:00,166 --> 00:27:02,596
(What did Uncle do again?)

284
00:27:02,742 --> 00:27:04,722
(Did he go too far?)

285
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:17,187
Mom. I really don't have time to meet your old colleague's son.

286
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:20,086
Yes, I have already broken up.

287
00:27:20,166 --> 00:27:21,585
Didn't I tell you?

288
00:27:21,666 --> 00:27:24,402
Even athletes have some time to rest between seasons.

289
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,670
Okay. After I'm done with my work matters, I'll do as you say.

290
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:30,726
I'm off to work. I need up hang up.

291
00:27:30,884 --> 00:27:31,944
Bye.

292
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:38,447
The sales of the last issue of the magazine doubled. Everyone worked hard.

293
00:27:38,542 --> 00:27:39,762
Keep up the good work.

294
00:27:46,767 --> 00:27:48,485
About Shu Yi's interview with Shi Yan,

295
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:49,645
the response is great as well.

296
00:27:49,726 --> 00:27:52,286
The content of the article was comprehensive, accurate, and bold.

297
00:27:52,366 --> 00:27:54,766
It also caused a good response within the news circle.

298
00:27:54,846 --> 00:27:57,116
Congratulations, Shu Yi, for achieving such good results.

299
00:27:57,287 --> 00:27:59,566
Let's all learn from her and keep up the good work.

300
00:27:59,646 --> 00:28:01,066
Yes!

301
00:28:13,447 --> 00:28:14,547
Shu Yi.

302
00:28:14,804 --> 00:28:17,957
Aren't you going to treat everyone to celebrate tonight?

303
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,368
Yeah, Shu Yi.

304
00:28:28,733 --> 00:28:31,284
Shu Yi. Everyone is talking to you.

305
00:28:40,837 --> 00:28:42,136
What does that mean?

306
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:46,202
Yu Ling. Are you talking to me?

307
00:28:46,447 --> 00:28:48,726
Sorry. I was wearing noise-canceling headphones. I didn't hear it.

308
00:28:48,806 --> 00:28:49,965
Oh.

309
00:28:50,046 --> 00:28:52,607
Everyone is saying you're unlucky in love but successful in your career.

310
00:28:52,687 --> 00:28:54,006
You wrote such a great article.

311
00:28:54,086 --> 00:28:55,987
Everyone wants you to treat them to dinner.

312
00:28:57,566 --> 00:28:59,306
Sure, why not? You guys pick a place.

313
00:29:03,886 --> 00:29:05,066
Excuse me.

314
00:29:09,975 --> 00:29:12,135
So, on my first day at work,

315
00:29:12,247 --> 00:29:14,906
I called her several times but she ignored me.

316
00:29:16,126 --> 00:29:18,477
Was it because she was wearing headphones and didn't hear me?

317
00:29:19,566 --> 00:29:20,987
Oh no.

318
00:29:21,366 --> 00:29:23,477
I even made a fool of myself in front of Uncle.

319
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:28,467
And then, he made her look so miserable.

320
00:29:29,872 --> 00:29:31,152
What kind of misunderstanding is this?

321
00:29:31,233 --> 00:29:32,922
Am I in an old-school romance novel?

322
00:29:33,921 --> 00:29:37,362
(Bogang Yunwan)

323
00:30:17,928 --> 00:30:19,108
Have you gone insane?

324
00:30:19,205 --> 00:30:21,875
Uncle, don't say anything.

325
00:30:22,451 --> 00:30:24,002
I'm thinking.

326
00:30:25,107 --> 00:30:27,617
Wow, are you actually thinking now?

327
00:30:31,582 --> 00:30:33,653
I'm asking you seriously.

328
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:38,670
What if I accidentally became the villain

329
00:30:39,228 --> 00:30:41,682
without knowing it?

330
00:30:42,817 --> 00:30:44,646
Do you have the intelligence to become a villain?

331
00:30:44,765 --> 00:30:47,356
Can't you stop insulting me for a while?

332
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:51,726
I only realized today that I misunderstood my superior.

333
00:30:51,837 --> 00:30:53,907
She wasn't intentionally ignoring me.

334
00:30:54,767 --> 00:30:56,027
What do you mean?

335
00:30:57,126 --> 00:30:59,962
In short, it was a misunderstanding.

336
00:31:00,054 --> 00:31:02,602
But I'm too embarrassed to apologize to her

337
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:05,907
because she didn't know anything about this matter and what I told you.

338
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:08,552
Right.

339
00:31:08,671 --> 00:31:11,629
Uncle. Aren't you too harsh on her?

340
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,677
Why don't you go apologize to her?

341
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,228
If you were a villain,

342
00:31:19,309 --> 00:31:22,168
you'd be eliminated within three minutes.

343
00:31:27,102 --> 00:31:28,542
Help me!

344
00:31:28,631 --> 00:31:31,468
I don't want to apologize in person.

345
00:31:31,577 --> 00:31:35,738
I, Qin Shi Yue, have lived for 22 years and have never hurt anyone.

346
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:39,847
Having to apologize to someone is too embarrassing.

347
00:31:39,927 --> 00:31:42,276
It hurts my self-esteem!

348
00:31:43,938 --> 00:31:47,208
Self-esteem? First, you need to have it for it to be hurt.

349
00:31:47,727 --> 00:31:51,286
Qin Shi Yue. I advise you to resolve this matter quickly.

350
00:31:51,366 --> 00:31:53,486
Otherwise, people forced to be the villain,

351
00:31:53,643 --> 00:31:54,684
like me,

352
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:58,066
might really become one against you.

353
00:32:11,007 --> 00:32:14,197
Nan, do you have Shu Yi's WeChat?

354
00:32:14,549 --> 00:32:17,980
So, you're saying Shi Yan also knows Qin Shi Yue?

355
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:21,459
Yeah. And he's quite concerned about her.

356
00:32:22,676 --> 00:32:25,312
This girl is really popular.

357
00:32:25,749 --> 00:32:28,726
No wonder she was able to help you get the invitation last time.

358
00:32:28,806 --> 00:32:31,666
Her family's condition should be pretty good too.

359
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:35,116
So, she was able to get into the magazine company through relationships.

360
00:32:36,488 --> 00:32:38,802
Shi Yan and her are both acquaintances.

361
00:32:38,981 --> 00:32:40,571
Everything makes sense now.

362
00:32:41,505 --> 00:32:44,016
I don't know how close they are.

363
00:32:44,886 --> 00:32:47,882
So, are you not happy about Shi Yan and her now?

364
00:32:48,164 --> 00:32:50,194
Are you jealous?

365
00:32:51,086 --> 00:32:52,227
Jealous?

366
00:32:52,899 --> 00:32:54,280
Not really, all right?

367
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:58,540
I do have some feelings for him though.

368
00:32:59,927 --> 00:33:01,121
Are you serious?

369
00:33:01,202 --> 00:33:02,447
Are you sure?

370
00:33:02,585 --> 00:33:04,447
Then, what about your special coverage?

371
00:33:04,527 --> 00:33:06,687
For popular people like him,

372
00:33:06,767 --> 00:33:09,957
if you two really get together and have work-related interactions,

373
00:33:10,038 --> 00:33:11,371
there'll surely be a lot of gossip.

374
00:33:11,452 --> 00:33:13,226
People will say all kinds of things about you.

375
00:33:13,606 --> 00:33:17,276
Also, don't you remember I told you about the rumors about him before?

376
00:33:17,366 --> 00:33:18,758
He was with an actress before,

377
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:22,185
and now he's got some weird interactions with your intern.

378
00:33:23,263 --> 00:33:26,246
For some relationships, if it's not meant to last,

379
00:33:26,327 --> 00:33:28,282
it's better not to start.

380
00:33:30,326 --> 00:33:32,116
I know what you're thinking.

381
00:33:32,487 --> 00:33:33,887
When it comes to relationships,

382
00:33:33,967 --> 00:33:36,036
I should just follow my heart.

383
00:33:37,301 --> 00:33:39,170
Is relationship

384
00:33:40,207 --> 00:33:41,917
really that simple?

385
00:33:43,393 --> 00:33:44,762
Add.

386
00:33:45,225 --> 00:33:46,485
Don't add.

387
00:33:48,007 --> 00:33:49,027
Add.

388
00:33:49,247 --> 00:33:50,836
Don't add.

389
00:33:51,846 --> 00:33:52,866
Add.

390
00:33:53,927 --> 00:33:55,267
Don't add.

391
00:33:56,767 --> 00:33:58,006
Qin Shi Yue.

392
00:33:58,086 --> 00:34:00,957
If you make another sound, get out of here.

393
00:34:43,967 --> 00:34:45,847
(Miss Song, you've been in the industry for so many years)

394
00:34:45,927 --> 00:34:47,686
(and had so many concerts.)

395
00:34:47,766 --> 00:34:50,646
(What's different about this 25th-anniversary concert)

396
00:34:50,726 --> 00:34:52,027
(compared to the others?)

397
00:34:52,487 --> 00:34:53,802
(Actually, over the years, )

398
00:34:53,881 --> 00:34:57,687
(I feel that every concert is a new beginning.)

399
00:34:58,038 --> 00:35:00,694
But this year, I feel like using my singing

400
00:35:00,881 --> 00:35:04,097
to bring all my old friends back to the past

401
00:35:04,286 --> 00:35:07,166
to find those beautiful memories.

402
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:11,566
So this year, I got the world's top sound,

403
00:35:11,647 --> 00:35:13,492
stage design, and lighting teams.

404
00:35:13,573 --> 00:35:17,562
I just want everyone to be able to relive the old memories

405
00:35:17,651 --> 00:35:19,240
while also having some new experiences.

406
00:35:19,967 --> 00:35:21,877
Your speech made us even more excited.

407
00:35:36,766 --> 00:35:38,596
Oh, I almost forgot.

408
00:35:39,967 --> 00:35:43,282
I originally wanted to grab the tickets to watch it with that scumbag.

409
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:49,722
Since he doesn't like to eat together,

410
00:35:49,963 --> 00:35:52,792
why not invite him to a concert instead?

411
00:35:53,005 --> 00:35:54,875
After all, he likes Song Le Lan too.

412
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,580
(No goodnight today)

413
00:36:09,726 --> 00:36:11,362
(because I'm feeling uneasy.)

414
00:36:11,499 --> 00:36:13,196
(I can't sleep now.)

415
00:36:13,515 --> 00:36:15,166
(If you add me on WeChat, )

416
00:36:15,246 --> 00:36:16,756
(then I can sleep.)

417
00:36:39,646 --> 00:36:40,767
(Mr. Shi.)

418
00:36:40,847 --> 00:36:42,347
(You like Song Le Lan too?)

419
00:36:43,606 --> 00:36:45,066
What a coincidence.

420
00:36:45,206 --> 00:36:46,512
I really like her too.

421
00:36:46,593 --> 00:36:48,086
I have all of her albums.

422
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:50,116
Which song of hers do you like the most?

423
00:37:16,228 --> 00:37:17,369
Oh no.

424
00:37:18,016 --> 00:37:20,005
Did I go too far?

425
00:37:30,367 --> 00:37:32,036
SY?

426
00:37:34,086 --> 00:37:35,266
Shi Yan.

427
00:37:36,831 --> 00:37:38,580
He finally added me on WeChat.

428
00:37:39,922 --> 00:37:42,402
I won. He responded to me.

429
00:37:47,418 --> 00:37:49,362
He's a bit girly.

430
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,491
The suffix he added after his name is a bit saucy.

431
00:37:55,927 --> 00:37:57,756
Visible for only three days?

432
00:37:58,766 --> 00:38:00,266
Quite mysterious.

433
00:38:03,487 --> 00:38:05,156
It's like his style too.

434
00:38:09,934 --> 00:38:12,563
(Finally, you added me on WeChat.)

435
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,651
(Are you going to sleep?)

436
00:38:30,407 --> 00:38:31,886
(I just saw this.)

437
00:38:31,994 --> 00:38:34,943
(I was thinking about whom to go to this concert with.)

438
00:38:38,754 --> 00:38:41,264
(Are you free tomorrow night?)

439
00:38:45,737 --> 00:38:48,087
(Let's go together tomorrow night then.)

440
00:38:55,443 --> 00:38:57,672
It worked out so smoothly.

441
00:38:57,992 --> 00:38:59,942
Did Shi Yan have a change of personality?

442
00:39:13,329 --> 00:39:15,480
(Miss Song, you've been in the industry for so many years)

443
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:17,506
(and have held so many concerts.)

444
00:39:17,587 --> 00:39:19,573
(What's different about)

445
00:39:19,654 --> 00:39:22,082
(this 25th-anniversary concert compared to the others?)

446
00:39:36,887 --> 00:39:39,556
(Shall we go to the concert together?)

447
00:39:50,967 --> 00:39:54,073
(But didn't San Mao say that if you don't like someone, )

448
00:39:54,154 --> 00:39:55,698
(you won't marry him even if he's a millionaire.)

449
00:39:55,779 --> 00:39:58,391
(If you like someone, you'll marry him even if he's a billionaire.)

450
00:39:58,493 --> 00:40:01,922
(When it comes to relationships, just follow your heart.)

451
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:14,042
(I have free tickets here.)

452
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:15,917
(Do you want to go together?)

453
00:40:25,847 --> 00:40:27,517
(Sure. See you then.)

454
00:41:08,877 --> 00:41:11,617
(Do you have time to play golf tomorrow afternoon?)

455
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:28,262
(Unsubscribe)
