00:01:31,162 --> 00:01:36,096
(Only For Love)

2
00:01:36,177 --> 00:01:39,042
(Episode 12)

3
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,402
Why are you being in such good mood?

4
00:01:48,161 --> 00:01:49,670
Is it that obvious?

5
00:01:58,671 --> 00:01:59,951
You've changed, huh?

6
00:02:00,031 --> 00:02:01,918
Knowing you should return something useless.

7
00:02:02,433 --> 00:02:04,623
I returned something? What did I return?

8
00:02:10,927 --> 00:02:12,670
Oh, that.

9
00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:15,440
It wasn't me. It's Shu Yi who returned it.

10
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,020
Zheng Shu Yi did?

11
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,020
Why did she still return it?

12
00:02:24,856 --> 00:02:29,042
I realized I might have misunderstood her last time,

13
00:02:29,123 --> 00:02:30,722
so I wanted to make it up to her.

14
00:02:30,815 --> 00:02:32,376
I bought her a few clothes.

15
00:02:32,457 --> 00:02:34,377
She said she wanted to return them at that time.

16
00:02:34,511 --> 00:02:37,762
I didn't let her, but I guess she still went and returned everything.

17
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,380
(So, she took the clothes to return them.)

18
00:02:47,191 --> 00:02:49,141
You called this "a few"?

19
00:02:54,249 --> 00:02:55,448
(Are you...)

20
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,082
(Tomorrow, are you...)

21
00:03:06,283 --> 00:03:08,882
But Shu Yi is truly passionate about her work.

22
00:03:08,951 --> 00:03:10,566
She received a last-minute notice yesterday

23
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,581
and left on a business trip early this morning.

24
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:13,991
Honestly,

25
00:03:14,071 --> 00:03:15,874
she's handling everything on her own, writing outlines,

26
00:03:15,898 --> 00:03:17,647
conducting interviews, going on business trips.

27
00:03:17,671 --> 00:03:19,007
It's really tough.

28
00:03:19,088 --> 00:03:21,068
I don't know where she gets the motivation.

29
00:03:21,418 --> 00:03:22,918
She went on a business trip?

30
00:03:23,177 --> 00:03:24,677
She left early this morning.

31
00:03:31,042 --> 00:03:34,522
(Wucheng)

32
00:03:55,482 --> 00:03:57,272
Things are progressing well at Le'an's end.

33
00:03:57,353 --> 00:03:59,322
Work is in order.

34
00:04:44,591 --> 00:04:45,870
Shi Yan,

35
00:04:46,004 --> 00:04:47,954
is your phone broken?

36
00:04:48,271 --> 00:04:49,821
Why haven't you contacted me?

37
00:04:50,431 --> 00:04:52,271
I've posted so many updates on Wechat Moments,

38
00:04:52,357 --> 00:04:54,348
shared so many beautiful photos,

39
00:04:54,863 --> 00:04:57,023
and you haven't shown any appreciation.

40
00:04:57,151 --> 00:04:58,651
Not even a "like."

41
00:05:07,397 --> 00:05:08,982
(What hotel are you staying at?)

42
00:05:09,084 --> 00:05:10,402
(Which room?)

43
00:05:17,272 --> 00:05:18,772
Hey, beautiful.

44
00:05:20,031 --> 00:05:21,662
What are you doing here?

45
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,492
I'm on a business trip for a colleague.

46
00:05:25,911 --> 00:05:28,821
Aren't you usually reluctant to cover out-of-town news?

47
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:31,581
And you have so many guys waiting for you.

48
00:05:34,608 --> 00:05:37,802
Shan Shan, is there something going on with you?

49
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,202
No, nothing.

50
00:05:39,664 --> 00:05:42,574
I just needed a break. Is that not allowed?

51
00:05:42,697 --> 00:05:45,750
Why don't you consider settling down with someone?

52
00:05:47,545 --> 00:05:50,522
Temporary stability isn't real stability.

53
00:05:50,714 --> 00:05:53,677
Some relationships can still be lost even when they seem stable.

54
00:05:54,471 --> 00:05:57,242
For me, that kind of stability carries too much risk.

55
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,922
What's the matter? Shi Yan hasn't contacted you yet?

56
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,592
No.

57
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:08,151
You know, with a phone that costs thousands of yuan,

58
00:06:08,231 --> 00:06:10,231
why hasn't it shown a little red notification dot?

59
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,282
Hello.

60
00:06:40,811 --> 00:06:41,882
Hello.

61
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:43,962
Where are you?

62
00:06:44,455 --> 00:06:45,682
Let's meet at our usual spot.

63
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:47,762
I'm not in Jiangcheng.

64
00:06:50,104 --> 00:06:51,604
When are you coming back then?

65
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,122
I'm not sure yet.

66
00:06:53,816 --> 00:06:55,682
I have to go. My friend is asleep.

67
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:31,442
Shan Shan, it's snowing.

68
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,741
It really is snowing.

69
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:43,562
The snow in Wucheng is so beautiful.

70
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,081
She's having such a great time there that she doesn't even miss home.

71
00:08:23,151 --> 00:08:25,962
Are you checking out the girl you took to the horse ranch last time?

72
00:08:28,711 --> 00:08:30,211
Be more open with it, will you?

73
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:34,394
She's an interesting girl.

74
00:08:34,551 --> 00:08:36,031
Why haven't I seen her around lately?

75
00:08:36,126 --> 00:08:37,466
She's on a business trip.

76
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:42,611
I read her interview article about you.

77
00:08:42,743 --> 00:08:44,333
It's actually quite good.

78
00:08:44,414 --> 00:08:45,853
Despite her young age,

79
00:08:45,934 --> 00:08:47,684
she's got quite the writing talent.

80
00:08:48,064 --> 00:08:51,614
Her view is sharper than many veteran journalists.

81
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:55,482
Her work is not bad.

82
00:08:56,551 --> 00:08:57,682
Yeah?

83
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:02,202
I remember you used to avoid dealing with the media.

84
00:09:03,008 --> 00:09:04,848
Well, everyone has to grow.

85
00:09:04,951 --> 00:09:06,751
Yunchuang is on the rise.

86
00:09:06,831 --> 00:09:08,119
We need media coverage

87
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,802
to help the public better understand us.

88
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,082
That's a good thing.

89
00:09:13,951 --> 00:09:16,362
Next time, invite this young lady here.

90
00:09:16,862 --> 00:09:19,503
I'd like to have a chat with the journalist

91
00:09:19,657 --> 00:09:21,297
who's managed to change your perspective,

92
00:09:22,591 --> 00:09:23,882
a proper chat.

93
00:09:24,591 --> 00:09:25,882
Come in.

94
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:41,999
Go stand over there.

95
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,248
Stand there.

96
00:09:46,863 --> 00:09:48,304
Strike a nice pose.

97
00:09:48,516 --> 00:09:51,282
- Why? - Don't worry about it. Just do as I say.

98
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,030
There you go. Change it up.

99
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,020
Okay, done.

100
00:10:10,136 --> 00:10:11,802
Why did you post it for me?

101
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,918
Does it look good?

102
00:10:13,951 --> 00:10:15,246
At least touch it up before you post.

103
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,882
It looks so beautiful.

104
00:10:17,087 --> 00:10:19,238
Do you really think my photography needs editing?

105
00:10:19,638 --> 00:10:20,750
Trust me,

106
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,842
Shi Yan will contact you soon.

107
00:10:27,345 --> 00:10:29,254
I think your ideas are sound,

108
00:10:30,191 --> 00:10:32,562
but you should also consider external perceptions.

109
00:10:34,511 --> 00:10:37,741
Your capabilities will be proven eventually.

110
00:10:38,215 --> 00:10:40,002
But until then,

111
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,602
compromise and diplomacy can't hurt.

112
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,482
True.

113
00:10:49,071 --> 00:10:50,282
I know

114
00:10:51,598 --> 00:10:53,122
these old folks.

115
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,282
They've seen Mingyu at its best.

116
00:10:57,728 --> 00:10:59,288
They made money doing this and that,

117
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,901
and they gained some confidence.

118
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,070
A few years ago,

119
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,670
when Mingyu was really struggling,

120
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,522
they still held on, out of loyalty.

121
00:11:05,676 --> 00:11:07,922
They didn't sell off, nor did they turn a blind eye.

122
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,922
Now that you're shining,

123
00:11:10,092 --> 00:11:13,521
it's only natural that they want to get some returns.

124
00:11:15,118 --> 00:11:16,599
They might be a bit impatient,

125
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,447
but they don't have any ill intentions.

126
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:20,922
I understand.

127
00:11:21,003 --> 00:11:22,304
That's why I'm even more determined

128
00:11:22,328 --> 00:11:24,802
to ensure their investments don't go wrong.

129
00:11:39,105 --> 00:11:42,442
(I heard that wishes made during the first snowfall always come true.)

130
00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:48,642
(It's snowing, I hope she's dressed warmly enough.)

131
00:11:49,734 --> 00:11:52,654
(Looks like she's really enjoying herself and doesn't want to come back.)

132
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:03,602
Shan Shan, you really are good at this.

133
00:12:06,545 --> 00:12:08,402
(When are you coming back to Jiangcheng?)

134
00:12:08,607 --> 00:12:10,107
His phone's fixed.

135
00:12:10,264 --> 00:12:13,882
Come on. He obviously missed you.

136
00:12:13,974 --> 00:12:15,765
He misses you.

137
00:12:22,552 --> 00:12:23,719
What's the rush?

138
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,300
Reply him later.

139
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,762
But what if he has a meeting later?

140
00:12:28,384 --> 00:12:30,202
Meetings eventually end.

141
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,842
He already replied,

142
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,642
so you should be a bit reserved.

143
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,220
Don't act like you couldn't wait to reply him.

144
00:12:37,071 --> 00:12:40,282
Give him a sense of distance,

145
00:12:40,447 --> 00:12:43,482
let him realize your uniqueness and value.

146
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:45,119
When should I reply then?

147
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:46,398
No rush.

148
00:12:46,479 --> 00:12:47,879
What should I reply?

149
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,122
Just say,

150
00:12:50,113 --> 00:12:52,682
"How did you know I'm not in Jiangcheng?"

151
00:12:52,935 --> 00:12:55,216
He must have seen my posts.

152
00:12:55,345 --> 00:12:57,562
Well, you need to make him admit it.

153
00:12:57,677 --> 00:13:01,002
No, you don't understand Shi Yan at all.

154
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,442
He's completely unromantic.

155
00:13:02,584 --> 00:13:05,482
He's not the type to appreciate this kind of distance.

156
00:13:08,431 --> 00:13:09,842
Okay, I get it now.

157
00:13:16,191 --> 00:13:18,340
With your flirting skills,

158
00:13:18,471 --> 00:13:20,867
I'm starting to think it's Shi Yan who's unromantic,

159
00:13:20,948 --> 00:13:22,687
it's that you lack charm.

160
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,413
(Uncle Guan wants to see you.)

161
00:13:27,329 --> 00:13:28,602
Uncle Guan?

162
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:30,402
Which Uncle Guan?

163
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:36,082
Who Uncle Guan is doesn't really matter.

164
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:39,962
You need to remove "Uncle Guan" and "meet" from that sentence.

165
00:13:40,249 --> 00:13:43,042
The person who wants to see you isn't Uncle Guan,

166
00:13:43,128 --> 00:13:45,518
it's Shi Yan, Mr. Shi.

167
00:13:47,073 --> 00:13:50,282
You two really are made for each other.

168
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,400
With your kindergarten-level flirting skills,

169
00:13:53,481 --> 00:13:57,202
only an awkward and reserved guy like him suits you.

170
00:14:01,201 --> 00:14:02,522
Shan Shan,

171
00:14:03,287 --> 00:14:05,207
Uncle Guan is Guan Xiang Cheng.

172
00:14:05,288 --> 00:14:07,518
Shi Yan calls him Uncle Guan.

173
00:14:07,904 --> 00:14:09,915
Guan Xiang Cheng?

174
00:14:13,902 --> 00:14:16,882
(Mr. Shi, don't keep me in suspense. Elaborate on that!)

175
00:14:20,848 --> 00:14:23,202
(Uncle Guan is willing to do an interview with you.)

176
00:14:27,088 --> 00:14:28,642
(Thank you, boss!)

177
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,562
(Massaging your legs, boss!)

178
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,250
(Will you come home now?)

179
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,242
(Yes! I'm coming back right away!)

180
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,202
I'm going to interview Guan Xiang Cheng.

181
00:14:42,739 --> 00:14:43,870
Oh my goodness!

182
00:14:43,951 --> 00:14:45,620
Is this a dream?

183
00:14:45,796 --> 00:14:47,176
An interview with Guan Xiang Cheng!

184
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,631
I can't believe I get to interview the legendary Guan Xiang Cheng.

185
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,762
Hang on,

186
00:14:54,128 --> 00:14:56,402
when did I apply for an interview with Guan Xiang Cheng?

187
00:14:57,306 --> 00:14:58,786
See, I've been telling you that.

188
00:14:58,904 --> 00:15:01,023
It's Shi Yan who wants you back.

189
00:15:01,103 --> 00:15:02,799
He must be missing you so much

190
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,791
that he suddenly texted you.

191
00:15:05,443 --> 00:15:06,510
Uncle Guan?

192
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:10,282
That's just his excuse to get you back to Jiangcheng as soon as possible.

193
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,970
Excuse?

194
00:15:13,463 --> 00:15:14,775
I'd better book a flight quickly

195
00:15:14,856 --> 00:15:16,841
and turn this interview into reality then.

196
00:15:20,095 --> 00:15:23,366
Zheng Shu Yi, can't you have a little reserve?

197
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,952
Shan Shan,

198
00:15:26,431 --> 00:15:28,282
this is Guan Xiang Cheng we're talking about.

199
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,642
I can be reserved personally,

200
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,620
but my professional ethics won't allow me to be reserved.

201
00:15:41,105 --> 00:15:45,515
I have to prepare the outline today for the interview tomorrow.

202
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:05,165
(I'm back!)

203
00:16:08,376 --> 00:16:09,876
(That's early.)

204
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:14,282
Why is he being so sarcastic?

205
00:16:16,648 --> 00:16:19,568
Could it really be he thinks I've been away from Jiangcheng for too long,

206
00:16:19,654 --> 00:16:21,015
and he misses me?

207
00:16:21,112 --> 00:16:22,942
Is he eager to see me?

208
00:16:28,851 --> 00:16:31,282
No, I'm probably overthinking it.

209
00:16:33,757 --> 00:16:35,522
(See you in a bit.)

210
00:16:39,816 --> 00:16:41,762
Okay. Got it.

211
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:47,122
I arranged the interview with Miss Zheng,

212
00:16:47,695 --> 00:16:49,445
and you're here even earlier than her.

213
00:16:50,152 --> 00:16:53,042
Well, I came to learn from you, Uncle Guan.

214
00:16:53,168 --> 00:16:54,602
Can't be late for that.

215
00:16:55,072 --> 00:16:56,902
Fine, I'll act like I believe that.

216
00:16:57,865 --> 00:17:00,202
How nice to be young.

217
00:17:09,351 --> 00:17:10,590
What happened?

218
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:11,886
Someone hit my car from behind.

219
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,410
Miss, give me a few minutes.

220
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,007
Were you watching the road?

221
00:17:23,031 --> 00:17:24,111
Were you watching the road?

222
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,522
Do you even know how to drive?

223
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,679
I was driving at a normal speed.

224
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,110
It was your sudden slowdown that caused the collision.

225
00:17:41,191 --> 00:17:42,459
I was driving at a normal speed too.

226
00:17:42,483 --> 00:17:44,240
You hit me, and that's why I stopped.

227
00:17:44,321 --> 00:17:45,744
All right, both of you, stop arguing.

228
00:17:45,768 --> 00:17:47,275
Let the traffic police and the insurance company handle it.

229
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:48,819
They will investigate and determine...

230
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,389
I don't care. It's your fault,

231
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,776
- it doesn't matter who comes. - Hello.

232
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,402
(Uncle Guan is waiting for you.)

233
00:17:54,944 --> 00:17:56,522
I'm sorry, I'm on my way.

234
00:17:56,591 --> 00:17:57,962
(My fault? How is it my fault?)

235
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:00,002
(Whose fault is it? You slowed down...)

236
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:01,563
What's happening there?

237
00:18:01,678 --> 00:18:02,838
(How is it my fault?)

238
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:05,359
The car I was in got rear-ended. We're handling it right now.

239
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,882
You're not injured, are you?

240
00:18:07,009 --> 00:18:08,282
(I'm fine.)

241
00:18:10,657 --> 00:18:11,657
Give me the address.

242
00:18:11,744 --> 00:18:13,424
I'll have Chen Sheng come and pick you up.

243
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,722
(Okay.)

244
00:18:15,769 --> 00:18:18,482
(I have no manners? It's you who has no manners.)

245
00:18:20,135 --> 00:18:21,962
- Name, please. - Wang Zhong.

246
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:23,802
And you?

247
00:18:24,282 --> 00:18:25,602
Yang Fei Fan.

248
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,762
Chen Sheng, I'm sorry. Just give me a minute.

249
00:18:31,249 --> 00:18:32,642
How come it's you?

250
00:18:32,881 --> 00:18:34,242
Are you hurt?

251
00:18:35,841 --> 00:18:36,973
I'm fine.

252
00:18:40,801 --> 00:18:42,301
What are you doing?

253
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,401
This car is a new energy vehicle.

254
00:18:44,488 --> 00:18:46,442
It seems like there's an issue with the battery.

255
00:18:46,536 --> 00:18:47,802
Battery?

256
00:18:48,448 --> 00:18:50,527
It's Zhanlan Technology's battery.

257
00:18:50,636 --> 00:18:52,774
Haven't they been in the middle of fundraising recently?

258
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,277
I've been following this news,

259
00:18:54,358 --> 00:18:55,838
so I want to learn more.

260
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,750
Maybe there will be some unexpected findings.

261
00:18:59,185 --> 00:19:00,435
I'll go with you.

262
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,719
Sir,

263
00:19:03,838 --> 00:19:05,256
have there been many similar accidents

264
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,126
involving this particular type of electric vehicle recently?

265
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,962
Not many, just a few cases.

266
00:19:09,442 --> 00:19:10,522
Excuse me, sir.

267
00:19:10,591 --> 00:19:13,562
Is this accident possibly related to the battery?

268
00:19:14,192 --> 00:19:15,311
It's uncertain.

269
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,602
A professional inspection is needed to draw any conclusions.

270
00:19:19,245 --> 00:19:21,682
Are both of you passengers?

271
00:19:22,007 --> 00:19:24,687
Everything is sorted out now. If there is nothing else, you may go.

272
00:19:24,824 --> 00:19:26,811
- Thank you. - Don't mention it.

273
00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:31,273
Oh no, I'm running late.

274
00:19:31,438 --> 00:19:33,602
I forgot to inform Mr. Guan.

275
00:19:36,591 --> 00:19:39,011
We need to hurry. I don't want to keep him waiting too long.

276
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,122
Come in.

277
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:54,122
Ms. Yi.

278
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,842
How may I help you, Yu Ling?

279
00:19:58,465 --> 00:20:01,425
Ms. Yi, I've talked to three vice presidents from commercial banks.

280
00:20:01,582 --> 00:20:03,882
They've agreed to do a joint interview with me.

281
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:07,892
I'd like to request that you reserve the front page for this month's issue.

282
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:11,122
Three vice presidents for an interview together?

283
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,440
That's great.

284
00:20:14,575 --> 00:20:16,002
It's a substantial interview.

285
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,619
It definitely belongs on the front page.

286
00:20:17,643 --> 00:20:18,962
Thank you, Ms. Yi.

287
00:20:19,831 --> 00:20:22,842
Yu Ling, you've always been the star of Financial Introduce.

288
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,630
Your professional skills are exceptional.

289
00:20:24,777 --> 00:20:27,032
The editor-in-chief and I have high expectations for you.

290
00:20:27,056 --> 00:20:28,556
Keep up the good work.

291
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,720
Thank you, Ms. Yi. I'll get back to work now.

292
00:20:49,311 --> 00:20:51,431
(Ms. Yi, I'm not going back to the office first.)

293
00:20:51,512 --> 00:20:53,562
(I have an interview with Guan Xiang Cheng today.)

294
00:20:56,536 --> 00:20:58,325
An interview with Guan Xiang Cheng?

295
00:21:01,744 --> 00:21:02,944
Got it.

296
00:21:03,025 --> 00:21:04,322
Handle it well.

297
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:15,082
Hello.

298
00:21:16,033 --> 00:21:18,442
How come you have time to call me during work hours?

299
00:21:18,854 --> 00:21:22,835
(Well, that's because what I want to talk to you about is work-related.)

300
00:21:23,511 --> 00:21:25,362
Mr. Guan, if I didn't call you personally,

301
00:21:25,443 --> 00:21:27,323
how could I be sure that our financial magazine

302
00:21:27,362 --> 00:21:29,002
has truly convinced you, the bigwig,

303
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,202
to do an interview with us?

304
00:21:34,351 --> 00:21:36,140
Miss Zheng told you, didn't she?

305
00:21:36,288 --> 00:21:39,202
I did ask her to come over today for a chat.

306
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:41,275
How did she manage to reach you?

307
00:21:42,452 --> 00:21:45,469
I read a few of her major works.

308
00:21:45,815 --> 00:21:47,282
At such a young age,

309
00:21:47,363 --> 00:21:49,619
her writing skills are truly impressive.

310
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,751
(Her words are sharp and well-reasoned.)

311
00:21:51,831 --> 00:21:53,322
(It's really awe-inspiring.)

312
00:21:54,015 --> 00:21:57,322
(So, I had a young man I knew invite her to my home for a chat.)

313
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,559
Naturally.

314
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:01,882
Shu Yi is one of my most trusted team members.

315
00:22:02,047 --> 00:22:05,267
Her professional skills are among the best in our magazine.

316
00:22:05,487 --> 00:22:07,727
(Her insight and acumen are high, )

317
00:22:07,831 --> 00:22:10,981
(which gives her writing depth and perspective.)

318
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:14,242
(I'm looking forward to this interview more and more.)

319
00:22:16,031 --> 00:22:18,362
You two fulfilled each other's wishes,

320
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,541
but you've also created a big trouble for me.

321
00:22:22,331 --> 00:22:24,120
Yes, sorry.

322
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,390
It's my oversight.

323
00:22:26,568 --> 00:22:28,068
I didn't inform you in advance,

324
00:22:28,709 --> 00:22:30,340
and I've caused you trouble.

325
00:22:31,031 --> 00:22:32,270
(How about this?)

326
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,221
I'll personally make it up to you in the evening.

327
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,741
I'll come pick you up after work.

328
00:22:39,056 --> 00:22:42,002
It's fine. I'll go there by myself tonight.

329
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:43,797
(See you tonight.)

330
00:22:44,167 --> 00:22:45,402
See you tonight.

331
00:22:52,568 --> 00:22:53,728
Uncle Guan.

332
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:55,042
You're here.

333
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:57,711
Come. Have a seat.

334
00:22:57,791 --> 00:22:58,870
Hello, Mr. Guan.

335
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,122
Sit.

336
00:23:01,133 --> 00:23:02,442
Miss Zheng,

337
00:23:03,655 --> 00:23:06,966
you're here as a journalist today.

338
00:23:08,017 --> 00:23:09,322
Let's keep it casual.

339
00:23:09,464 --> 00:23:10,736
You can just call me Uncle Guan,

340
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,322
like Shi Yan does.

341
00:23:12,528 --> 00:23:13,768
No need to be formal.

342
00:23:13,849 --> 00:23:15,122
Sure.

343
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:18,602
Let's just chat casually today.

344
00:23:18,902 --> 00:23:20,562
I've read some of your articles.

345
00:23:20,684 --> 00:23:22,184
I think they're well-written.

346
00:23:22,551 --> 00:23:26,004
You have many fresh perspectives and thoughtful ideas,

347
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:27,988
and your angles are quite sharp.

348
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,140
You're too kind.

349
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:32,922
It's been a long time since I've talked to

350
00:23:33,003 --> 00:23:35,883
a young person other than Shi Yan.

351
00:23:35,964 --> 00:23:38,922
So, I invited you here today to have a chat.

352
00:23:39,663 --> 00:23:41,303
It's an opportunity for me, an old-timer,

353
00:23:41,349 --> 00:23:42,670
to engage with the thoughts

354
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,802
of young people and learn something.

355
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:46,162
You're too humble.

356
00:23:46,262 --> 00:23:48,261
I should be learning from you.

357
00:23:48,389 --> 00:23:49,829
Well, it goes both ways.

358
00:23:49,909 --> 00:23:51,409
Let's start with a cup of tea.

359
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,950
This is from my special collection.

360
00:23:53,004 --> 00:23:54,554
I don't offer it to just anyone.

361
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,390
I'm not much of a tea drinker.

362
00:23:57,481 --> 00:23:59,002
I usually prefer soft drinks.

363
00:23:59,082 --> 00:24:00,711
I might not know how to appreciate it.

364
00:24:00,852 --> 00:24:02,352
Give it a try.

365
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,570
Drink it. You'll like it.

366
00:24:04,779 --> 00:24:06,279
It's brewed with snow water.

367
00:24:06,819 --> 00:24:09,362
What's so special about snow water?

368
00:24:10,387 --> 00:24:12,097
You like snow, don't you?

369
00:24:14,603 --> 00:24:16,313
How do you know she likes snow?

370
00:24:19,924 --> 00:24:21,802
She mentioned it in Wechat Moments.

371
00:24:22,196 --> 00:24:25,142
(Is Shi Yan being sarcastic?)

372
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:28,082
(He is upset that I've been away for too long.)

373
00:24:35,246 --> 00:24:37,348
It's good, and it has the taste of snow.

374
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,722
I really like it.

375
00:24:41,763 --> 00:24:43,832
You two discuss business.

376
00:24:43,913 --> 00:24:45,413
I'll go to the yard.

377
00:24:58,816 --> 00:25:00,339
Let's begin, Mr. Guan.

378
00:25:00,526 --> 00:25:01,642
Okay.

379
00:25:39,942 --> 00:25:41,362
It's hard to imagine, isn't it?

380
00:25:41,467 --> 00:25:44,856
My first pot of gold was 435 yuan.

381
00:25:45,092 --> 00:25:49,552
It's unbelievable that it has grown into Guan Capital.

382
00:25:50,442 --> 00:25:51,953
Wow!

383
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:53,683
That's amazing!

384
00:25:53,996 --> 00:25:55,496
Zheng Shu Yi,

385
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,280
tone it down.

386
00:26:01,739 --> 00:26:03,482
Uncle Guan, lunch is ready.

387
00:26:04,403 --> 00:26:07,483
I was engrossed in my conversation with Miss Zheng,

388
00:26:07,594 --> 00:26:09,094
and I lost track of time.

389
00:26:09,188 --> 00:26:12,602
Shi Yan, now that you mentioned it, I'm actually feeling a bit hungry.

390
00:26:13,401 --> 00:26:16,202
Mr. Guan, I had a very enjoyable time chatting with you today.

391
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,643
I'll prepare the draft for your review as soon as possible.

392
00:26:18,692 --> 00:26:20,374
Please go and have your lunch. I'll take my leave.

393
00:26:20,398 --> 00:26:21,962
The food is served.

394
00:26:22,043 --> 00:26:23,282
You should stay for lunch.

395
00:26:23,621 --> 00:26:24,858
He's not in a hurry.

396
00:26:24,939 --> 00:26:26,258
What are you rushing for?

397
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:31,319
Let's eat.

398
00:26:31,516 --> 00:26:32,722
Come on.

399
00:26:35,339 --> 00:26:36,930
Well, if you insist.

400
00:26:39,881 --> 00:26:41,162
Please have a seat.

401
00:26:43,437 --> 00:26:45,922
Miss Zheng, how old are you?

402
00:26:46,252 --> 00:26:48,682
I'm 25, turning 26 soon.

403
00:26:50,453 --> 00:26:53,442
Shi Yan is 27, two years older than you.

404
00:26:54,666 --> 00:26:57,616
Your zodiac signs match well.

405
00:26:59,763 --> 00:27:00,923
I thought so too.

406
00:27:01,004 --> 00:27:02,504
Let's eat.

407
00:27:05,996 --> 00:27:08,522
Any other plans for later?

408
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,682
Want to visit the ranch again?

409
00:27:13,172 --> 00:27:14,711
It's been a while since both of us went there.

410
00:27:14,735 --> 00:27:16,562
I've been wanting to go again.

411
00:27:16,643 --> 00:27:19,322
The scenery at the ranch is so refreshing.

412
00:27:19,403 --> 00:27:20,800
But I've been quite busy lately,

413
00:27:20,881 --> 00:27:22,722
so I'll have to go another time.

414
00:27:22,881 --> 00:27:24,667
Whenever you want to go, just go.

415
00:27:25,042 --> 00:27:26,542
Right, Shi Yan?

416
00:27:26,874 --> 00:27:28,374
Thank you, Uncle Guan.

417
00:27:29,683 --> 00:27:32,832
Shi Yan hasn't been to the ranch as often in the past couple of years,

418
00:27:34,315 --> 00:27:36,362
but he knows the place very well.

419
00:27:36,483 --> 00:27:37,962
You've been there with him before.

420
00:27:38,299 --> 00:27:39,658
If there's anything you're unsure of,

421
00:27:39,682 --> 00:27:41,182
you can ask him.

422
00:27:41,891 --> 00:27:43,922
Did he used to go to the ranch often?

423
00:27:45,252 --> 00:27:48,156
After starting his own company, he became very busy and visited less often.

424
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:52,002
When he was little, he used to go every week.

425
00:27:54,838 --> 00:27:57,467
Looks like Mr. Shi has always loved horseback riding.

426
00:27:59,387 --> 00:28:01,688
What was he like when he was little?

427
00:28:02,077 --> 00:28:05,002
He was sensible even as a child.

428
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,511
He had high standards for himself.

429
00:28:07,874 --> 00:28:09,738
However, children,

430
00:28:09,914 --> 00:28:13,624
no matter how composed and calm they may be,

431
00:28:13,809 --> 00:28:16,602
they still have their moments of frustration and unhappiness.

432
00:28:16,857 --> 00:28:18,962
When he encountered something upsetting back then,

433
00:28:19,217 --> 00:28:20,658
he wouldn't say anything to anyone,

434
00:28:20,739 --> 00:28:22,437
not even his father.

435
00:28:22,883 --> 00:28:24,163
He just loved to go to the ranch

436
00:28:24,205 --> 00:28:26,435
and ride the horses round and round.

437
00:28:27,188 --> 00:28:30,698
His personality hasn't changed much from when he was little.

438
00:28:32,307 --> 00:28:33,807
He's still taciturn.

439
00:28:34,867 --> 00:28:37,402
When Mingyu was in trouble,

440
00:28:38,157 --> 00:28:39,917
it disrupted his entrepreneurial plans.

441
00:28:40,021 --> 00:28:43,661
He stayed to sort things out at Mingyu

442
00:28:43,742 --> 00:28:46,172
before leaving to start Yunchuang.

443
00:28:47,236 --> 00:28:50,625
He entrusted Mingyu to his brother-in-law.

444
00:28:50,965 --> 00:28:53,684
Many people don't know the details

445
00:28:53,795 --> 00:28:56,469
and assume he avoided responsibility,

446
00:28:56,728 --> 00:28:58,007
but the truth is,

447
00:28:58,106 --> 00:29:00,762
he took on more responsibility

448
00:29:00,928 --> 00:29:02,838
and made greater sacrifices than anyone.

449
00:29:06,389 --> 00:29:08,602
In fact, others don't know

450
00:29:08,673 --> 00:29:11,722
that Shi Yan handed over his honor to his brother-in-law,

451
00:29:11,803 --> 00:29:15,842
who he felt was the most suitable person to take over.

452
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:19,162
He has always had a vision

453
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:20,987
and has been preparing for it for a long time,

454
00:29:21,011 --> 00:29:23,241
that's why he established Yunchuang.

455
00:29:24,898 --> 00:29:26,338
He just doesn't like to talk,

456
00:29:26,434 --> 00:29:28,505
especially about his feelings.

457
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:30,570
When you have the chance,

458
00:29:30,651 --> 00:29:32,090
try to chat with him more

459
00:29:32,171 --> 00:29:34,161
and help him change this bad habit.

460
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:37,252
Don't keep everything to yourself.

461
00:29:38,481 --> 00:29:39,507
Uncle Guan,

462
00:29:39,974 --> 00:29:42,122
enjoy the prawns while they're still warm.

463
00:29:43,201 --> 00:29:45,351
See, he won't let me tell you that.

464
00:29:45,594 --> 00:29:46,647
All right.

465
00:29:46,878 --> 00:29:48,842
Let him open up to you himself.

466
00:29:54,411 --> 00:29:55,911
However,

467
00:29:55,996 --> 00:30:00,146
with Yunchuang flourishing, his sacrifices and efforts

468
00:30:00,881 --> 00:30:02,381
aren't in vain.

469
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:05,199
He's poured all his energy into Yunchuang over the last few years,

470
00:30:05,223 --> 00:30:06,893
not even leaving time for dating.

471
00:30:09,382 --> 00:30:11,742
Yunchuang is now highly regarded in the industry.

472
00:30:11,908 --> 00:30:13,189
The projects it chooses

473
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:16,842
also reflect Mr. Shi's sense of social responsibility and foresight.

474
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:19,641
I believe Mr. Shi will achieve his ideals.

475
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:24,202
Miss Zheng,

476
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:26,482
you are an exceptional young lady as well.

477
00:30:26,901 --> 00:30:29,202
I've interacted with many people in the journalism field,

478
00:30:29,455 --> 00:30:32,282
including friends I've known for years,

479
00:30:32,428 --> 00:30:34,459
and in the end, they all changed careers.

480
00:30:34,668 --> 00:30:36,739
You are so young and have so many opportunities.

481
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:39,002
It's not easy to persevere in this profession.

482
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:43,282
In our magazine, we actually have a majority of female employees,

483
00:30:43,503 --> 00:30:45,802
and most of them are quite attractive.

484
00:30:48,749 --> 00:30:52,210
Being good-looking can also be an asset.

485
00:30:52,663 --> 00:30:54,103
When it comes to doing interviews,

486
00:30:54,183 --> 00:30:57,602
who doesn't enjoy chatting with a pretty

487
00:30:57,693 --> 00:31:00,015
and intelligent female journalist?

488
00:31:01,832 --> 00:31:02,871
That's right.

489
00:31:03,023 --> 00:31:06,562
Mr. Shi also likes beautiful female journalists.

490
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,730
Right, Mr. Shi?

491
00:31:11,547 --> 00:31:12,687
Am I wrong?

492
00:31:12,862 --> 00:31:15,762
Last time at the press conference, my colleague who attended with me,

493
00:31:15,822 --> 00:31:17,722
you stared at her for quite a while.

494
00:31:20,062 --> 00:31:21,562
Did that really happen?

495
00:31:22,223 --> 00:31:23,714
- I didn't. - You did.

496
00:31:25,406 --> 00:31:28,562
Chef, these spare ribs are still a bit spicy.

497
00:31:28,735 --> 00:31:30,362
Can you adjust them a bit?

498
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:41,802
You asked her later where she went.

499
00:31:41,872 --> 00:31:43,689
I told you she wasn't feeling well and went home.

500
00:31:43,713 --> 00:31:45,393
You even asked me what was wrong with her.

501
00:31:47,192 --> 00:31:48,802
I was just teasing you.

502
00:31:51,183 --> 00:31:52,215
Really?

503
00:31:52,983 --> 00:31:55,042
What? You don't believe me?

504
00:31:57,152 --> 00:31:59,712
- Not really. - What would it take for you to believe me then?

505
00:32:02,342 --> 00:32:03,842
I want to eat that.

506
00:32:06,062 --> 00:32:07,562
I want some prawns.

507
00:32:11,735 --> 00:32:13,922
If you don't peel them for me...

508
00:32:16,302 --> 00:32:17,802
I'll do it myself.

509
00:32:33,525 --> 00:32:34,567
Here you go.

510
00:33:03,798 --> 00:33:04,810
Get in.

511
00:33:07,644 --> 00:33:09,725
The weather is so nice today.

512
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:12,322
The sun is shining so brightly, it feels really pleasant.

513
00:33:12,832 --> 00:33:14,831
It's a perfect day for a walk, don't you think?

514
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:16,402
What do you want now?

515
00:33:20,232 --> 00:33:22,552
I don't want to take the car first, I want to take a walk.

516
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:24,126
Will you walk with me?

517
00:33:25,575 --> 00:33:26,922
Zheng Shu Yi,

518
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:30,322
you're becoming more and more demanding now.

519
00:33:32,772 --> 00:33:34,711
I'm not just demanding,

520
00:33:34,829 --> 00:33:36,329
I can also compose poetry.

521
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:38,475
Poetry?

522
00:33:39,927 --> 00:33:42,322
"Shu Yi is far away from Jiangcheng,

523
00:33:42,463 --> 00:33:45,042
Shi Yan is jealous of the snow."

524
00:33:59,062 --> 00:34:00,562
Zheng Shu Yi.

525
00:34:01,983 --> 00:34:04,413
What? I didn't say anything wrong.

526
00:34:06,062 --> 00:34:07,062
Right.

527
00:34:07,872 --> 00:34:09,242
You're right.

528
00:34:15,342 --> 00:34:19,122
I didn't expect my little poem to please you so much.

529
00:34:20,421 --> 00:34:23,501
I also prepared something else to please you.

530
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:25,673
Would you like to hear it, Mr. Shi?

531
00:34:38,315 --> 00:34:40,635
These days, I've been brainstorming,

532
00:34:40,727 --> 00:34:43,982
and I've prepared a special feature plan for Yunchuang.

533
00:34:44,164 --> 00:34:47,071
Every punctuation mark was typed by my own hands,

534
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:51,229
expressing my dedication and importance to you and this interview.

535
00:34:57,072 --> 00:34:59,382
It's getting late. You should go back.

536
00:35:07,182 --> 00:35:08,482
It's nothing.

537
00:35:08,871 --> 00:35:11,912
It's just that typing out this feature plan one character at a time

538
00:35:11,993 --> 00:35:13,462
made my wrist a little sore.

539
00:35:13,542 --> 00:35:16,082
It's not a major issue. I can endure it.

540
00:35:23,863 --> 00:35:25,202
Fine.

541
00:35:26,693 --> 00:35:28,032
Fine what?

542
00:35:28,273 --> 00:35:30,662
You want to do a special feature on Yunchuang, right?

543
00:35:30,757 --> 00:35:32,242
You have my permission.

544
00:35:32,503 --> 00:35:34,572
- Thank you, Mr... - But I have two conditions.

545
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:36,822
I'll agree to 200 conditions if you have them.

546
00:35:38,617 --> 00:35:42,223
First, you must closely follow and deeply understand Yunchuang,

547
00:35:42,303 --> 00:35:43,823
as well as my daily work,

548
00:35:43,903 --> 00:35:45,543
the specific details of various projects,

549
00:35:45,573 --> 00:35:47,484
and especially my work philosophy.

550
00:35:50,195 --> 00:35:52,142
That sounds a bit strange.

551
00:35:52,222 --> 00:35:54,754
Will you agree or not, Miss Zheng?

552
00:35:55,424 --> 00:35:56,583
Yes.

553
00:35:56,664 --> 00:36:00,282
I wouldn't miss the opportunity to gain a deep understanding of you.

554
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:04,303
Second, if the article is biased

555
00:36:04,422 --> 00:36:05,742
or not sufficiently in-depth,

556
00:36:05,869 --> 00:36:08,969
I reserve the right to halt this special feature at any time.

557
00:36:10,072 --> 00:36:11,621
That's quite stringent.

558
00:36:16,672 --> 00:36:18,042
Get in the car.

559
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:24,062
I agree to the second condition as well.

560
00:36:24,152 --> 00:36:25,588
Looking forward to working with Yunchuang.

561
00:36:25,612 --> 00:36:28,042
I won't give you a reason to halt it.

562
00:36:31,162 --> 00:36:33,443
Fan, take Miss Zheng home first.

563
00:36:33,563 --> 00:36:34,923
I have other matters to attend to.

564
00:36:35,076 --> 00:36:36,482
Yes, Mr. Shi.

565
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,952
(Forget it. Be patient.)

566
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:52,282
(She still doesn't know me well enough.)

567
00:36:52,549 --> 00:36:54,682
(I'll wait until the day she knows me well enough)

568
00:36:54,788 --> 00:36:56,288
(before making a decision.)

569
00:37:07,449 --> 00:37:10,602
(Goodbye, Wucheng.)

570
00:37:20,903 --> 00:37:21,987
(Dear passengers, )

571
00:37:22,068 --> 00:37:26,657
(boarding for flight MU5857 to Jiangcheng has begun.)

572
00:38:07,072 --> 00:38:09,383
What a coincidence. Are you here to pick someone up?

573
00:38:10,823 --> 00:38:12,692
Yes. You.

574
00:38:13,032 --> 00:38:14,202
Can't I?

575
00:38:14,742 --> 00:38:16,082
Me?

576
00:38:20,126 --> 00:38:23,036
It's been a long time since we last met. I kind of...

577
00:38:23,822 --> 00:38:25,042
Miss you.

578
00:38:29,503 --> 00:38:31,003
I figured as much.

579
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:43,919
That's the operational status of Zhanlan in recent years.

580
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,662
It's understood that three automotive companies

581
00:38:46,742 --> 00:38:48,502
and two investment firms

582
00:38:48,606 --> 00:38:51,367
have expressed a clear interest in collaborating with Zhanlan.

583
00:38:51,574 --> 00:38:54,162
If Yunchuang wants to collaborate with Zhanlan,

584
00:38:54,371 --> 00:38:56,121
the competition will be fierce.

585
00:38:56,836 --> 00:38:57,977
Mr. Shi,

586
00:38:58,632 --> 00:39:00,142
you need to put in more effort.

587
00:39:01,386 --> 00:39:03,078
Yu You, what's your opinion?

588
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:06,328
Solid-state batteries possess high performance and safety features,

589
00:39:06,352 --> 00:39:08,647
and they do have the potential to be the future direction.

590
00:39:08,671 --> 00:39:10,871
There is a huge potential market for demand.

591
00:39:10,983 --> 00:39:13,373
They also align with the national dual-carbon initiative.

592
00:39:13,742 --> 00:39:15,242
In this race,

593
00:39:15,933 --> 00:39:17,722
Zhanlan is indeed the frontrunner.

594
00:39:17,808 --> 00:39:19,732
Mr. Yu's analysis is spot on.

595
00:39:20,096 --> 00:39:22,602
Zhanlan's production system is very mature right now.

596
00:39:22,711 --> 00:39:25,191
Investing in them would mean lower risks for us.

597
00:39:25,311 --> 00:39:26,431
However,

598
00:39:26,592 --> 00:39:27,842
the competition is fierce,

599
00:39:27,999 --> 00:39:29,969
and it's not like the previous rounds of investment.

600
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:32,962
This means Yunchuang may have to pay a hefty price

601
00:39:33,074 --> 00:39:34,944
to get a share of this market.

602
00:39:35,129 --> 00:39:37,222
But the assessment concludes

603
00:39:37,381 --> 00:39:39,891
that this market has great potential.

604
00:39:42,392 --> 00:39:43,474
Mr. Shi.

605
00:39:45,342 --> 00:39:47,585
Mr. Shi, what do you think?

606
00:39:49,549 --> 00:39:50,925
Did everyone notice the recent accident

607
00:39:50,949 --> 00:39:53,539
involving a new energy vehicle a couple of days ago?

608
00:39:53,909 --> 00:39:56,699
I think it was an accident involving Hengxin's new energy vehicle.

609
00:39:57,752 --> 00:40:00,082
They use Zhanlan's batteries.

610
00:40:00,163 --> 00:40:01,663
Zhanlan?

611
00:40:01,943 --> 00:40:04,182
Car accidents aren't uncommon, are they?

612
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:07,162
Besides, it might not necessarily be a battery issue.

613
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:10,461
Investing in any field is a risky venture,

614
00:40:10,558 --> 00:40:12,157
so I'd like to do more preparation work.

615
00:40:12,181 --> 00:40:14,251
As mentioned earlier,

616
00:40:14,408 --> 00:40:17,468
investing in Zhanlan is highly competitive.

617
00:40:17,558 --> 00:40:21,122
For Yunchuang, Zhanlan is definitely the top choice.

618
00:40:21,391 --> 00:40:22,711
Mr. Shi,

619
00:40:22,823 --> 00:40:26,263
I remember you were quite bullish on Zhanlan before, weren't you?

620
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:27,423
What I'm bullish on

621
00:40:27,504 --> 00:40:30,832
is the positive impact of new energy on future living and the environment,

622
00:40:31,022 --> 00:40:34,012
and the significance of entering this field for Yunchuang.

623
00:40:34,342 --> 00:40:35,982
However, the solid-state battery industry

624
00:40:36,121 --> 00:40:37,676
requires substantial investment.

625
00:40:37,788 --> 00:40:40,762
I believe it's necessary to do more research and analysis.

626
00:40:41,129 --> 00:40:44,263
But I heard they will make a decision within these two months.

627
00:40:44,372 --> 00:40:46,761
By that time, if we want to choose another company,

628
00:40:46,842 --> 00:40:48,102
won't it be too late?

629
00:40:48,182 --> 00:40:49,343
That's right.

630
00:40:49,424 --> 00:40:51,750
Many investment firms have already placed their bets.

631
00:40:51,832 --> 00:40:53,112
It's unlikely they're all wrong.

632
00:40:53,167 --> 00:40:57,242
If needed, we can negotiate with them to take a smaller share.

633
00:40:57,742 --> 00:41:00,343
Mr. Shi, I know you're cautious,

634
00:41:00,423 --> 00:41:05,562
but we can't miss the chance to invest in Zhanlan.

635
00:41:09,312 --> 00:41:10,472
Tan Yong,

636
00:41:10,542 --> 00:41:11,959
conduct another round of evaluation,

637
00:41:11,983 --> 00:41:13,182
and then we'll decide.

638
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,522
Yes, Mr. Shi.

639
00:41:20,863 --> 00:41:23,322
Shi Yan, that was a smart move.

640
00:41:23,542 --> 00:41:25,562
It really is challenging to secure Zhanlan.

641
00:41:25,779 --> 00:41:27,260
If you can pull this off,

642
00:41:27,365 --> 00:41:28,865
everyone will think you're amazing.

643
00:41:29,303 --> 00:41:31,502
Even if we don't succeed, they won't blame us.

644
00:41:31,702 --> 00:41:33,435
This is truly impressive.

645
00:41:34,582 --> 00:41:36,419
This is the written report from the assessment department.

646
00:41:36,443 --> 00:41:37,688
Take a look.

647
00:41:37,838 --> 00:41:39,471
It lists the number of accidents involving

648
00:41:39,495 --> 00:41:40,887
new energy vehicles using this battery

649
00:41:40,911 --> 00:41:43,931
and includes some related accident investigation reports.

650
00:41:48,661 --> 00:41:51,171
There have been so many accidents just in the past year.

651
00:41:52,368 --> 00:41:54,128
But that doesn't necessarily prove anything.

652
00:41:54,254 --> 00:41:56,242
New energy vehicles have a large user base now.

653
00:41:56,341 --> 00:41:58,183
The likelihood of accidents is naturally higher.

654
00:41:58,207 --> 00:41:59,502
Conventional cars also have accident rates,

655
00:41:59,526 --> 00:42:01,347
which might not be lower than new energy vehicles.

656
00:42:01,371 --> 00:42:04,151
You got a point, but the core issue now

657
00:42:04,262 --> 00:42:06,363
is that even though Zhanlan has a significant market share,

658
00:42:06,387 --> 00:42:09,022
they are still using last year's battery technology,

659
00:42:09,172 --> 00:42:11,122
and there has been no update or iteration.

660
00:42:12,152 --> 00:42:14,718
Their orders are piling up now. If they secure funding successfully,

661
00:42:14,742 --> 00:42:16,182
they most likely aim to expand

662
00:42:16,262 --> 00:42:18,443
and continuously increase their market share.

663
00:42:18,926 --> 00:42:20,205
But in the long term,

664
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:22,673
technological breakthroughs are the key.

665
00:42:26,272 --> 00:42:28,423
If the battery issue remains unresolved

666
00:42:28,503 --> 00:42:30,242
and accidents keep happening,

667
00:42:30,307 --> 00:42:32,762
major car manufacturers will look for alternative solutions.

668
00:42:33,316 --> 00:42:36,528
In that case, our investment might not be a safe bet.

669
00:42:37,668 --> 00:42:39,828
Zhanlan's current financing is already in the B round.

670
00:42:39,855 --> 00:42:41,442
After the angel round and Series A,

671
00:42:41,629 --> 00:42:42,802
in a way,

672
00:42:42,883 --> 00:42:45,164
it no longer aligns with Yunchuang's investment strategy.

673
00:42:45,582 --> 00:42:48,024
We can make this an exception, but like you said,

674
00:42:48,105 --> 00:42:50,562
conducting another round of research is necessary.

675
00:42:53,331 --> 00:42:56,735
It's those uncles who are in a rush to invest in Zhanlan.

676
00:42:56,922 --> 00:42:59,819
If anything goes wrong, they'll blame us for making the wrong call.

677
00:42:59,983 --> 00:43:02,474
So, we can't just go along with what they said.

678
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:05,322
Shi Yan, let's proceed as you said.

679
00:43:06,983 --> 00:43:09,602
Let's wait for the results of the next evaluation.

680
00:43:09,934 --> 00:43:13,282
Looks like I'll have to make a trip there myself.
