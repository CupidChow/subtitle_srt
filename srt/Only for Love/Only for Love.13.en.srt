1
00:01:30,818 --> 00:01:36,081
(Only For Love)

2
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:38,962
(Episode 13)

3
00:01:39,043 --> 00:01:42,842
(Financial Introduce)

4
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,026
Shu Yi, you're back.

5
00:01:58,088 --> 00:01:59,976
I heard that you did an interview as soon as you came back.

6
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,960
Seems like you're experiencing failure in love but success in your career.

7
00:02:03,276 --> 00:02:05,320
Yu Ling, come to my office.

8
00:02:05,485 --> 00:02:06,732
Okay, Ms. Yi.

9
00:02:14,564 --> 00:02:18,069
You went for an interview as soon as you got off the plane yesterday?

10
00:02:18,313 --> 00:02:20,082
I interviewed Guan Xiang Cheng.

11
00:02:22,868 --> 00:02:23,909
What? Who?

12
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,099
Guan...

13
00:02:26,014 --> 00:02:30,070
Yes, it's the same Guan Xiang Cheng you're thinking of.

14
00:02:30,866 --> 00:02:32,322
Guan Xiang Cheng?

15
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,470
Ms. Yi, what did you say?

16
00:02:36,613 --> 00:02:39,022
You can't give me the front page for this month. Why?

17
00:02:39,332 --> 00:02:42,922
Yu Ling, the editor-in-chief and I know that you have been working hard.

18
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:45,722
Originally, we decided to give you the front page.

19
00:02:45,877 --> 00:02:47,402
- But later on... - Ms. Yi.

20
00:02:47,556 --> 00:02:50,120
Do you know how much effort I put into this interview,

21
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:51,495
how many strings I had to pull,

22
00:02:51,576 --> 00:02:52,922
how many weeks I spent

23
00:02:53,036 --> 00:02:55,796
to persuade the three vice presidents to agree to a joint interview?

24
00:02:55,948 --> 00:02:57,477
How can you go back on your word?

25
00:02:57,588 --> 00:02:58,876
Do you know that this morning,

26
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:02,536
Zheng Shu Yi submitted the first draft of Guan Xiang Cheng's interview?

27
00:03:02,644 --> 00:03:04,964
If you were the editor-in-chief, how would you arrange it?

28
00:03:05,232 --> 00:03:06,822
Who is Guan Xiang Cheng?

29
00:03:07,088 --> 00:03:10,080
If we don't feature his personal interview on the front page,

30
00:03:10,378 --> 00:03:14,837
the industry might think our magazine has lost its mind.

31
00:03:16,502 --> 00:03:19,043
Ms. Yi, Guan Xiang Cheng has stayed out of the limelight

32
00:03:19,124 --> 00:03:21,245
and refused to be interviewed for many years.

33
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:25,020
I seriously doubt the authenticity of this interview.

34
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:26,833
I verified it.

35
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:28,479
It was a face-to-face interview.

36
00:03:34,332 --> 00:03:36,802
Zheng Shu Yi is really something.

37
00:03:37,423 --> 00:03:40,082
What methods did she use to bewitch Guan Xiang Cheng?

38
00:03:40,163 --> 00:03:42,882
Is she willing to sacrifice her integrity for just a front page?

39
00:03:42,963 --> 00:03:44,242
Enough.

40
00:03:44,452 --> 00:03:46,914
Stop saying things without any factual basis.

41
00:03:48,243 --> 00:03:51,667
I still have some understanding of what kind of person Guan Xiang Cheng is.

42
00:03:51,915 --> 00:03:53,716
He's not what you imagine him to be.

43
00:03:53,862 --> 00:03:55,845
Zheng Shu Yi has been your colleague for many years.

44
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:57,855
She would never do such a thing.

45
00:03:59,602 --> 00:04:02,042
If there's nothing else, you can get back to your work now.

46
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,797
Okay, Ms. Yi.

47
00:04:19,431 --> 00:04:21,880
- Zheng Shu Yi, you're doing this on purpose, aren't you? - What?

48
00:04:21,904 --> 00:04:24,344
Did you put in a lot of effort to interview Guan Xiang Cheng?

49
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,594
I had always wanted to interview Guan Xiang Cheng,

50
00:04:28,618 --> 00:04:31,417
but I didn't have to put in a lot of effort. He contacted me himself.

51
00:04:31,653 --> 00:04:33,482
Maybe it's because I've been lucky lately.

52
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,215
Lucky?

53
00:04:35,738 --> 00:04:38,131
Guan Xiang Cheng has been out of the media limelight for so many years.

54
00:04:38,155 --> 00:04:39,835
Now you're telling me that it's just luck?

55
00:04:40,925 --> 00:04:43,425
Yes, otherwise, what do you think it is?

56
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,770
Who doesn't know that you're beautiful and charming?

57
00:04:47,061 --> 00:04:49,682
You've probably maximized your advantages, right?

58
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:51,865
No wonder you've been dressing up nicely recently,

59
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:53,202
but we rarely get to see you.

60
00:05:01,028 --> 00:05:02,528
Xu Yu Ling.

61
00:05:02,786 --> 00:05:05,067
We're all colleagues. Don't speak so harshly.

62
00:05:05,148 --> 00:05:07,122
What? She dared to do it but not admit it?

63
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,689
If I relied on my looks for work,

64
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:17,419
do you think you could stand in front of me and say these things?

65
00:05:26,841 --> 00:05:28,282
Have you done all your work?

66
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:29,879
Are you having a tea party here?

67
00:05:33,756 --> 00:05:35,603
Zheng Shu Yi, come to my office.

68
00:05:41,947 --> 00:05:43,987
No matter how pretty you are, you still get dumped.

69
00:05:44,586 --> 00:05:46,002
Have you thought it over?

70
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,991
Are you sure you want to publish the Yunchuang's special coverage

71
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:49,442
in the digital magazine?

72
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,080
I've thought it over.

73
00:05:51,247 --> 00:05:52,597
I also told Shi Yan about it.

74
00:05:52,677 --> 00:05:53,917
He agreed.

75
00:05:53,997 --> 00:05:55,357
He agreed?

76
00:05:55,437 --> 00:05:57,522
Yes, I got the authorization from Shi Yan.

77
00:05:57,603 --> 00:06:00,483
He agreed to publish this special coverage only in the digital magazine.

78
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:05,396
All right, I've also talked to the editor-in-chief.

79
00:06:05,528 --> 00:06:07,076
Let's create a special coverage first.

80
00:06:07,156 --> 00:06:08,436
If it goes well, we'll continue.

81
00:06:08,465 --> 00:06:10,341
If not, we can postpone it.

82
00:06:11,483 --> 00:06:12,629
Got it.

83
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:16,037
Right, Shu Yi, you also have to prepare the articles for the main issue.

84
00:06:16,117 --> 00:06:17,875
Are you sure you can manage your time?

85
00:06:18,091 --> 00:06:19,131
No problem.

86
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:21,884
Guan Xiang Cheng's draft will be done in the next two days.

87
00:06:22,789 --> 00:06:26,535
You're really not leaving any chance for others, not even a bite of food.

88
00:06:27,091 --> 00:06:29,369
I'm still young and I need to grow.

89
00:06:29,533 --> 00:06:31,562
I need to eat more than others.

90
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:42,685
(Thank you.)

91
00:06:45,984 --> 00:06:48,722
(I suddenly sent this to him. Can he understand it?)

92
00:06:50,658 --> 00:06:52,962
If he doesn't understand, he can ask me.

93
00:06:53,153 --> 00:06:56,530
If he asks me, I will explain it to him and thank him again.

94
00:07:32,945 --> 00:07:34,202
(Busy.)

95
00:07:37,692 --> 00:07:40,146
(When will I have the honor to treat you to a meal)

96
00:07:40,257 --> 00:07:41,590
(to express my gratitude?)

97
00:07:43,645 --> 00:07:45,965
Mom, you have to eat more today.

98
00:07:46,077 --> 00:07:49,642
Grandpa specially cooked these for you when he knew you were coming back.

99
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,824
I can tell right away that they are all my favorite food.

100
00:07:51,848 --> 00:07:54,226
- Dad, thank you. - Eat more.

101
00:07:55,533 --> 00:07:57,565
Come on, Dad, eat more.

102
00:08:00,059 --> 00:08:01,830
Yue, how are you doing at work recently?

103
00:08:01,911 --> 00:08:03,922
- Have you adapted to it? - It's okay.

104
00:08:04,148 --> 00:08:06,618
I'm just a little tired. I have a lot of work every day.

105
00:08:07,243 --> 00:08:09,743
Are you getting along well with your colleagues?

106
00:08:11,059 --> 00:08:13,597
Right, something happened today.

107
00:08:13,734 --> 00:08:15,162
My leader, Zheng Shu Yi...

108
00:08:15,243 --> 00:08:16,762
Mom, you know her.

109
00:08:16,836 --> 00:08:18,922
Last time she asked me to go to your concert.

110
00:08:19,725 --> 00:08:21,482
Yes, I remember her.

111
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,162
She interviewed Uncle Guan yesterday.

112
00:08:25,286 --> 00:08:26,755
Ms. Yi was so happy

113
00:08:26,858 --> 00:08:29,218
that she immediately gave her the front page of this month.

114
00:08:29,654 --> 00:08:32,162
I don't know how she contacted Uncle Guan.

115
00:08:32,405 --> 00:08:33,905
She said she was lucky.

116
00:08:38,516 --> 00:08:41,076
Shu Yi is unaware of the distance to Jiangcheng,

117
00:08:41,157 --> 00:08:43,747
and Shi Yan is jealous of snow.

118
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,802
I'll get some water. Eat up.

119
00:09:02,038 --> 00:09:05,559
As a result, Xu Yu Ling was unhappy and came to argue.

120
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,800
In front of everyone,

121
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:09,132
she said that Shu Yi got the opportunity because of her looks.

122
00:09:09,156 --> 00:09:10,357
Don't you think it's funny?

123
00:09:10,437 --> 00:09:12,426
She really shouldn't have said that.

124
00:09:12,944 --> 00:09:16,095
But luck is also a part of one's ability.

125
00:09:16,247 --> 00:09:17,516
This is nothing.

126
00:09:17,739 --> 00:09:19,426
Guess what Shu Yi said?

127
00:09:19,611 --> 00:09:20,651
What did she say?

128
00:09:20,739 --> 00:09:24,196
She said, "If I relied on my looks for work,

129
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:27,242
"do you think you could stand in front of me and say these things?"

130
00:09:27,786 --> 00:09:29,359
That's ridiculous.

131
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:32,352
She doesn't even realize how many people pursue Shu Yi every day.

132
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:33,773
Is it necessary for her to do this?

133
00:09:33,797 --> 00:09:35,547
I've only been working for a short time,

134
00:09:35,684 --> 00:09:39,920
and I've seen numerous men courting Shu Yi.

135
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:41,157
Really?

136
00:09:41,237 --> 00:09:44,393
And this afternoon, I accompanied Shu Yi to the dessert shop

137
00:09:44,474 --> 00:09:46,195
downstairs of the magazine to buy tea.

138
00:09:46,276 --> 00:09:48,357
There was a tall and handsome guy in the shop

139
00:09:48,437 --> 00:09:50,396
who insisted on treating Shu Yi to coffee.

140
00:09:50,477 --> 00:09:51,722
Qin Shi Yue.

141
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,355
Have you said enough?

142
00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:56,767
Yes, enough.

143
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:05,562
Mom, did I offend Uncle again?

144
00:10:09,917 --> 00:10:12,329
(When will I have the honor to invite you to a meal)

145
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,743
(to express my gratitude?)

146
00:10:19,861 --> 00:10:21,067
(This weekend.)

147
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:23,403
(What do you want to eat?)

148
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:29,087
(It doesn't matter what to eat.)

149
00:10:33,429 --> 00:10:35,122
What's important then?

150
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,217
Surprise.

151
00:10:49,272 --> 00:10:50,901
Mom, why are you here?

152
00:10:55,995 --> 00:10:57,162
Yi.

153
00:10:57,397 --> 00:10:58,717
Sit over there.

154
00:10:58,852 --> 00:11:00,602
Why stay so far away?

155
00:11:03,307 --> 00:11:04,470
Here, Auntie.

156
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,237
Yu You, you don't know,

157
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,002
Yi started dressing up early today just to see you.

158
00:11:13,371 --> 00:11:15,762
(Did I do that because I wanted to meet Yu You?)

159
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:23,802
Since young, you've not only been obedient but also smart.

160
00:11:24,133 --> 00:11:25,933
You're even more remarkable now.

161
00:11:26,037 --> 00:11:28,106
You've become a university professor.

162
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,227
And you look even more handsome now.

163
00:11:30,317 --> 00:11:32,522
Are a lot of girls chasing after you?

164
00:11:33,075 --> 00:11:34,408
Auntie, you're flattering me.

165
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:39,117
Come on, have some tea.

166
00:11:39,197 --> 00:11:41,202
(There should be enough time after dinner.)

167
00:11:43,468 --> 00:11:45,458
The temperature of this tea is just right.

168
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:47,961
You're really thoughtful.

169
00:11:48,276 --> 00:11:52,356
It's not easy to find such a thoughtful guy nowadays.

170
00:11:52,585 --> 00:11:54,085
Right, Yi?

171
00:11:55,386 --> 00:11:57,619
(Shi Yan is also very thoughtful.)

172
00:12:01,132 --> 00:12:03,717
You are very capable at work.

173
00:12:03,858 --> 00:12:06,101
I saw it online.

174
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,556
- Right, Yi? - Yes.

175
00:12:08,636 --> 00:12:11,376
Professor Yu is young and promising with a bright future.

176
00:12:17,085 --> 00:12:18,722
(A movie was released recently.)

177
00:12:18,843 --> 00:12:20,762
(The feedback from reviews is good.)

178
00:12:20,848 --> 00:12:22,348
(Shall we watch it together tonight?)

179
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:27,562
Agree quickly.

180
00:12:28,271 --> 00:12:29,292
Thanks.

181
00:12:29,781 --> 00:12:33,162
These dishes are Yi's and my favorites.

182
00:12:33,956 --> 00:12:35,602
Auntie, go ahead and eat first.

183
00:12:40,123 --> 00:12:41,482
Time to eat.

184
00:12:48,422 --> 00:12:50,052
It's about work, right?

185
00:12:50,755 --> 00:12:53,836
You see, you guys are still so busy even on the weekend.

186
00:12:53,963 --> 00:12:55,512
You're really hardworking.

187
00:12:56,037 --> 00:12:57,117
Sorry, Auntie.

188
00:12:57,197 --> 00:12:58,482
It was a message from a friend.

189
00:12:58,572 --> 00:13:00,362
It's okay, go ahead.

190
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:07,159
(I'm sorry, I don't have time tonight. I need to accompany an elder.)

191
00:13:09,116 --> 00:13:11,856
(Ms. Wang, you're really my mother.)

192
00:13:11,937 --> 00:13:14,077
(You don't even know what I gave up for you.)

193
00:13:14,157 --> 00:13:16,826
(It's an opportunity to have a meal alone with Shi Yan.)

194
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,790
No!

195
00:13:21,437 --> 00:13:24,547
You actually used such a cliched reason to reject me.

196
00:13:25,128 --> 00:13:26,968
You didn't even put in any effort.

197
00:13:27,616 --> 00:13:29,426
Did he really think I would believe it?

198
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:34,826
(Okay, I'll ask you out again when you're free.)

199
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:38,922
But I already bought the tickets.

200
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:41,186
Shu Yi.

201
00:13:44,515 --> 00:13:47,282
(Shu Yi, do you want to watch a movie together tonight?)

202
00:13:47,554 --> 00:13:50,784
(I bought the tickets, but someone bailed on me.)

203
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,199
(I didn't do anything.)

204
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,160
(Why does it feel like I'm being inspected for having an affair?)

205
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:03,521
(Help.)

206
00:14:03,725 --> 00:14:04,747
(Wait.)

207
00:14:05,163 --> 00:14:07,993
(Why would I feel sorry for Shi Yan?)

208
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:12,729
It's impolite to play with your phone while eating.

209
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,921
It was a message from my colleague.

210
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:18,102
A girl should follow rules in everything she does.

211
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,857
That's how she can be likable.

212
00:14:27,094 --> 00:14:28,997
(I'm sorry, Yue, I can't make it today.)

213
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:31,077
(My mom is here. I'm spending time with her.)

214
00:14:31,157 --> 00:14:33,066
(I'll watch it with you next time, okay?)

215
00:14:35,956 --> 00:14:40,847
In the vast city of Jiangcheng, am I the only idle person tonight?

216
00:14:44,062 --> 00:14:46,143
Mom, are you full?

217
00:14:46,238 --> 00:14:47,517
Can we go home?

218
00:14:49,049 --> 00:14:50,388
I'm so full.

219
00:14:51,051 --> 00:14:55,247
Take a walk with me to aid digestion.

220
00:14:56,203 --> 00:14:58,502
Yu You, you're free, right?

221
00:15:03,756 --> 00:15:04,916
Yes, Auntie.

222
00:15:28,538 --> 00:15:29,882
(Sorry, Mr. Shi.)

223
00:15:29,976 --> 00:15:32,059
(My mom suddenly came. I have to spend time with her.)

224
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:34,122
(I can only treat you to dinner another time.)

225
00:15:55,449 --> 00:15:56,562
Mom.

226
00:15:56,699 --> 00:15:58,769
You don't want to watch a movie, do you?

227
00:15:59,452 --> 00:16:01,002
I don't want to watch it.

228
00:16:01,884 --> 00:16:04,402
But you two can watch it.

229
00:16:05,437 --> 00:16:07,589
I've already bought the movie tickets.

230
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,137
Take them.

231
00:16:09,356 --> 00:16:12,202
Don't worry, I've checked online.

232
00:16:12,327 --> 00:16:14,556
The reviews for this movie are pretty good.

233
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,824
It's very suitable for young people.

234
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,317
You've both accompanied me all night.

235
00:16:19,397 --> 00:16:21,602
You should have your own time now, right?

236
00:16:22,037 --> 00:16:24,082
Mom, it's quite late now.

237
00:16:24,515 --> 00:16:26,146
It's not good to watch a movie so late, right?

238
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:28,890
Haven't you always told me that young people shouldn't stay up late?

239
00:16:29,236 --> 00:16:30,357
It's quite late.

240
00:16:30,437 --> 00:16:31,556
I should go back.

241
00:16:31,674 --> 00:16:35,002
But at this hour, you two probably won't be able to sleep, right?

242
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:38,317
All right, go in quickly. Go watch the movie.

243
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:39,607
Auntie.

244
00:16:40,344 --> 00:16:41,844
I'll go buy some water first.

245
00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:48,539
When did you buy the ticket?

246
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,730
I think your arrangement is quite good. How about you two go?

247
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:56,484
What are you talking about?

248
00:16:56,632 --> 00:16:59,563
This is a romance movie, suitable for young people.

249
00:16:59,707 --> 00:17:01,376
All right, go in quickly.

250
00:17:01,514 --> 00:17:03,235
If you go in late, it will affect others.

251
00:17:03,316 --> 00:17:04,316
Go quickly.

252
00:17:05,467 --> 00:17:06,642
Yi.

253
00:17:06,995 --> 00:17:10,386
Remember to tell me what the credit scene is when you get back.

254
00:17:21,364 --> 00:17:23,257
(A gift from my mother.)

255
00:17:48,162 --> 00:17:49,690
(Watching a movie with your mother?)

256
00:17:56,415 --> 00:17:57,416
(Yes.)

257
00:17:58,401 --> 00:17:59,681
(Is it good?)

258
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,300
(Not as good if I don't watch it with you.)

259
00:18:08,277 --> 00:18:09,802
(What does that mean?)

260
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,226
(Your mother is quite trendy.)

261
00:18:12,307 --> 00:18:13,862
(She's watching this kind of movie.)

262
00:18:26,644 --> 00:18:28,765
(This movie is quite thrilling.)

263
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:31,410
(The female lead sneaked into the male lead's house)

264
00:18:31,491 --> 00:18:33,371
(in the red dress she wore when they first met)

265
00:18:33,433 --> 00:18:35,622
(and took away his ashes.)

266
00:18:36,497 --> 00:18:39,016
(The male lead's family discovered it and chased after her.)

267
00:18:39,128 --> 00:18:40,839
(Now the chase scene begins.)

268
00:19:05,316 --> 00:19:06,412
What kind of ending is this?

269
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:08,737
Who knows? That's rubbish.

270
00:19:09,881 --> 00:19:11,036
It's finally over.

271
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:12,361
Let's go.

272
00:19:12,441 --> 00:19:14,442
It's making me tired.

273
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:18,760
(Qin Shi Yue? How could it be such a coincidence?)

274
00:19:18,841 --> 00:19:21,343
(If she sees us, it will be hard to explain.)

275
00:19:21,424 --> 00:19:23,602
Yu You, I saw someone I know.

276
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,414
So, you know, I have to leave first.

277
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,321
Well, if my mom asks, just say you're busy. Thanks.

278
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:30,407
Okay.

279
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:37,339
Professor Yu.

280
00:19:37,921 --> 00:19:38,957
Good evening.

281
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,491
You told me you were with an elder,

282
00:19:41,572 --> 00:19:43,322
but actually, you came to watch a movie.

283
00:19:49,308 --> 00:19:50,347
What are you looking for?

284
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,370
I was looking for the person who watched the movie with you.

285
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,153
There was no one.

286
00:19:55,587 --> 00:19:57,176
You came alone?

287
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,451
Then why didn't you ask me to accompany you?

288
00:20:01,532 --> 00:20:03,122
Watching movies alone is quite boring.

289
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:07,030
But we were watching the same movie.

290
00:20:07,133 --> 00:20:09,957
Rounded up, it's considered we watched it together, right?

291
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,442
Did you drive?

292
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:17,391
- Yes. - I didn't drive.

293
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,941
Look, it's so late.

294
00:20:20,306 --> 00:20:22,322
It's not safe for me to go home alone.

295
00:20:22,551 --> 00:20:25,482
Could you please send me home?

296
00:20:36,488 --> 00:20:39,359
What kind of movies do you usually like to watch?

297
00:20:44,461 --> 00:20:46,341
Something like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.

298
00:20:47,881 --> 00:20:49,951
Such a coincidence, I like it too.

299
00:21:03,905 --> 00:21:07,242
The male lead is a psychiatric patient.

300
00:21:07,403 --> 00:21:10,707
He was sent to a mental hospital because of his mental disorder.

301
00:21:11,464 --> 00:21:13,305
His girlfriend missed him so much that

302
00:21:13,401 --> 00:21:15,071
she ended up in the mental hospital too.

303
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:23,180
He longed for freedom and tried various ways to escape.

304
00:21:24,361 --> 00:21:26,242
In the end, with everyone's help,

305
00:21:26,323 --> 00:21:28,842
he escaped the mental hospital with everyone

306
00:21:28,953 --> 00:21:30,427
and got a new life.

307
00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:33,899
What's wrong?

308
00:21:34,645 --> 00:21:35,802
Nothing.

309
00:21:51,968 --> 00:21:54,402
Do you have a girlfriend?

310
00:21:59,641 --> 00:22:02,661
How do you know it belongs to my girlfriend?

311
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:08,562
Don't you find this strange?

312
00:22:08,643 --> 00:22:10,716
It's quite strange.

313
00:22:16,303 --> 00:22:18,983
Ms. Bi, Mr. Guan is also here. He's sitting over there.

314
00:22:19,163 --> 00:22:20,663
Do you want to join him?

315
00:22:29,617 --> 00:22:30,656
Guan Ji.

316
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,122
What a coincidence.

317
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:34,384
Do you want to come to our table and have a drink?

318
00:22:35,503 --> 00:22:36,623
No.

319
00:22:36,704 --> 00:22:38,184
I don't believe you don't want to.

320
00:22:38,265 --> 00:22:39,625
Come on, follow me.

321
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,220
I've said no.

322
00:22:42,409 --> 00:22:43,960
My girlfriend is sitting over there.

323
00:22:44,259 --> 00:22:47,242
If I stay with you, she will get angry.

324
00:22:47,371 --> 00:22:48,731
You're so bad.

325
00:22:48,812 --> 00:22:50,091
Why are you making such a joke?

326
00:22:50,172 --> 00:22:51,750
When did you have a girlfriend?

327
00:22:53,924 --> 00:22:55,553
Did you see that she's angry?

328
00:22:55,804 --> 00:22:57,402
It's true.

329
00:22:57,964 --> 00:22:59,797
She controls me very strictly.

330
00:23:10,441 --> 00:23:12,308
Why did you leave without saying hello?

331
00:23:15,924 --> 00:23:18,149
Isn't this how we usually interact?

332
00:23:21,804 --> 00:23:24,623
It's already so late. Let me take you home.

333
00:23:43,314 --> 00:23:45,842
(Yi, has the movie ended?)

334
00:23:45,931 --> 00:23:47,371
(Did he send you home?)

335
00:23:47,452 --> 00:23:48,754
The movie has ended.

336
00:23:48,974 --> 00:23:51,003
He lives far away and so I didn't let him send me.

337
00:23:59,652 --> 00:24:02,001
I'll be home soon. Talk to you later, I'm hanging up.

338
00:24:14,139 --> 00:24:15,197
Shi Yan.

339
00:24:15,688 --> 00:24:17,398
Why are you here?

340
00:24:35,204 --> 00:24:36,413
Tell me,

341
00:24:37,055 --> 00:24:38,644
whom didn't you let send you home?

342
00:24:40,227 --> 00:24:42,058
No one.

343
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:43,587
Just a friend.

344
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,017
What kind of friend?

345
00:24:47,168 --> 00:24:49,682
Look, the moon is full today.

346
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:53,941
It's so bright. Look at it!

347
00:25:39,461 --> 00:25:40,762
Zheng Shu Yi.

348
00:25:42,204 --> 00:25:43,442
Zheng Shu Yi.

349
00:25:57,284 --> 00:25:58,642
(Zheng Shu Yi.)

350
00:25:58,764 --> 00:26:01,132
(What nonsense are you thinking about in your mind?)

351
00:26:16,221 --> 00:26:18,458
It's cold at night. Where's your hat?

352
00:26:20,394 --> 00:26:21,567
Thanks.

353
00:26:23,747 --> 00:26:27,416
Mr. Shi, did you happen to pass by, or did you purposely come to see me?

354
00:26:30,963 --> 00:26:32,513
It's almost midnight now.

355
00:26:32,673 --> 00:26:34,474
I live at Bogang Yunwan.

356
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,531
How can I possibly pass by your place?

357
00:26:42,841 --> 00:26:44,341
Was the movie good?

358
00:26:48,124 --> 00:26:50,034
It wasn't good, yet you only came back now.

359
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:53,130
Is the special coverage for Yunchuang prepared flawlessly?

360
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:57,452
You just got the authorization from me yesterday

361
00:26:57,547 --> 00:26:59,747
and you played until midnight before coming home today.

362
00:27:00,627 --> 00:27:02,228
Mr. Shi, tonight,

363
00:27:02,353 --> 00:27:05,313
you didn't come all the way here just to rush me for the article, did you?

364
00:27:05,614 --> 00:27:06,922
Don't worry.

365
00:27:07,034 --> 00:27:09,531
I've prepared the special coverage for Yunchuang for a long time.

366
00:27:09,555 --> 00:27:11,305
I guarantee there won't be any mistakes.

367
00:27:14,698 --> 00:27:16,219
It's already after work hours.

368
00:27:16,354 --> 00:27:18,562
I can watch any movie I want

369
00:27:18,675 --> 00:27:21,016
and play until whatever time I desire.

370
00:27:22,075 --> 00:27:24,922
I'm an adult with the ability to make my own decisions.

371
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,682
Mr. Shi, even if you don't want to sleep,

372
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:29,530
you don't need to come all the way to my place to supervise my work.

373
00:27:37,149 --> 00:27:38,649
What are you looking at?

374
00:27:58,818 --> 00:28:00,795
Who did you go to the movie with?

375
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,250
My mom.

376
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,405
Where's your mom?

377
00:28:06,378 --> 00:28:07,832
My mom...

378
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:10,944
My mom...

379
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:18,282
My mom is here.

380
00:28:22,142 --> 00:28:24,242
(Yi, why aren't you home yet?)

381
00:28:24,307 --> 00:28:26,457
I'm coming up right now. I'll be there soon.

382
00:28:29,081 --> 00:28:31,442
My mom is looking for me. I'm going back first.

383
00:28:47,221 --> 00:28:48,621
It's Guan Xiang Cheng.

384
00:28:48,778 --> 00:28:51,570
Yes, he's the idol of everyone in Financial Introduce.

385
00:28:53,533 --> 00:28:55,454
This journalist is quite impressive

386
00:28:55,535 --> 00:28:57,822
to be able to interview Guan Xiang Cheng.

387
00:28:59,995 --> 00:29:01,202
Thank you.

388
00:29:01,283 --> 00:29:04,038
Yes, thank you for your support over the years.

389
00:29:06,924 --> 00:29:07,940
Mr. Wang.

390
00:29:09,937 --> 00:29:10,978
Thank you.

391
00:29:11,075 --> 00:29:13,184
Shu Yi is indeed excellent.

392
00:29:13,829 --> 00:29:15,329
Hello, Mr. Li.

393
00:29:15,646 --> 00:29:17,146
Mr. Li, long time no see.

394
00:29:21,164 --> 00:29:23,755
Okay, Xiao Ming, I'll ask Chen Sheng to make the contact.

395
00:29:28,901 --> 00:29:30,213
(Personal Interview: Guan Xiang Cheng)

396
00:29:30,237 --> 00:29:32,003
(Our Generation; Writer: Zheng Shu Yi)

397
00:29:41,524 --> 00:29:42,734
Come in for a while.

398
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:51,565
Mr. Shi.

399
00:29:52,075 --> 00:29:54,275
Mr. Qin wants to schedule an interview with Miss Zheng.

400
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:55,506
Please help to contact her.

401
00:29:55,609 --> 00:29:56,646
Okay.

402
00:29:58,571 --> 00:30:00,841
Don't mention it's Mr. Qin right away.

403
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,659
Just say he's my friend.

404
00:30:02,778 --> 00:30:04,652
Check if she has time available.

405
00:30:05,611 --> 00:30:06,799
I understand.

406
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,358
Mr. Shi's friend?

407
00:30:12,296 --> 00:30:14,522
So, Mr. Shi asked you to contact me?

408
00:30:14,603 --> 00:30:17,323
(Yes, Mr. Shi's friend asked for Mr. Shi's help, )

409
00:30:17,427 --> 00:30:19,642
(and Mr. Shi entrusted me with it.)

410
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:22,887
But my interview schedule is already fully booked.

411
00:30:25,487 --> 00:30:28,698
How about this? I have a colleague who writes excellent profiles.

412
00:30:28,779 --> 00:30:31,259
How about I give you her contact information?

413
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,819
Could you recommend her to Mr. Shi's friend?

414
00:30:33,968 --> 00:30:35,206
(Sure, no problem.)

415
00:30:35,287 --> 00:30:36,815
(Thank you, Miss Zheng.)

416
00:30:36,908 --> 00:30:38,056
You're welcome.

417
00:30:42,533 --> 00:30:44,455
What's so great about her?

418
00:30:45,091 --> 00:30:47,659
She's just riding on Guan Xiang Cheng's fame.

419
00:30:48,121 --> 00:30:51,430
Whose career wouldn't take off after interviewing Guan Xiang Cheng?

420
00:30:53,772 --> 00:30:55,331
That's right.

421
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:58,370
But do you have the ability to secure an interview with Guan Xiang Cheng?

422
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,642
Let's see how much longer she can be smug.

423
00:31:10,219 --> 00:31:11,325
Come in.

424
00:31:15,126 --> 00:31:16,626
Ms. Yi, you wanted to see me?

425
00:31:17,264 --> 00:31:18,531
Pass me the water.

426
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,722
Do you know why I asked you to pass me water?

427
00:31:34,339 --> 00:31:36,729
All the calls I received this morning were looking for you.

428
00:31:38,442 --> 00:31:39,942
Looking for me?

429
00:31:40,803 --> 00:31:43,203
Yes, they were requesting to make appointments with you.

430
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:44,901
What's your plan?

431
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:49,000
Things are different now.

432
00:31:49,164 --> 00:31:50,664
In simple terms,

433
00:31:51,051 --> 00:31:52,171
you're famous now.

434
00:31:54,667 --> 00:31:57,708
I had a minor car accident the other day.

435
00:31:57,835 --> 00:32:00,515
It's a new energy vehicle using Zhanlan's battery.

436
00:32:00,665 --> 00:32:03,302
Zhanlan is currently undergoing a new round of financing, so I thought...

437
00:32:03,326 --> 00:32:04,826
Zheng Shu Yi.

438
00:32:05,643 --> 00:32:08,443
Do you even realize what a great opportunity this is?

439
00:32:08,565 --> 00:32:10,225
So many people are specifically requesting you now.

440
00:32:10,249 --> 00:32:11,873
You just need to write a few more articles

441
00:32:11,897 --> 00:32:14,486
and you might even get to sit in the office next to me.

442
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,160
Does that mean if I sit in the office next to you,

443
00:32:19,241 --> 00:32:21,201
I could have my own independent digital magazine?

444
00:32:22,587 --> 00:32:23,826
You...

445
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:25,494
It's like I'm preaching to deaf ears.

446
00:32:25,674 --> 00:32:27,955
Tell me, what should we do with these interview requests?

447
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:30,482
Don't worry, Ms. Yi.

448
00:32:30,617 --> 00:32:32,117
I'll handle it.

449
00:32:32,748 --> 00:32:34,042
Thank you, Ms. Yi.

450
00:32:40,451 --> 00:32:41,602
Nan Nan.

451
00:32:42,524 --> 00:32:44,635
An important partner of Yunchuang wants to make an appointment

452
00:32:44,659 --> 00:32:45,802
for an exclusive interview.

453
00:32:45,883 --> 00:32:46,922
Are you interested?

454
00:32:47,003 --> 00:32:49,153
If you agree, I'll give him your WeChat.

455
00:32:50,441 --> 00:32:52,311
Sounds good.

456
00:32:52,682 --> 00:32:54,825
But they want you, right?

457
00:32:55,202 --> 00:32:57,283
This interviewee is a short video content creator.

458
00:32:57,371 --> 00:32:59,042
You have more expertise in that area.

459
00:32:59,217 --> 00:33:01,698
I'm working on another topic and I really don't have time.

460
00:33:03,595 --> 00:33:04,722
Okay, then.

461
00:33:06,603 --> 00:33:08,283
What are you thinking?

462
00:33:08,364 --> 00:33:10,563
You let me handle such an important client for you.

463
00:33:10,644 --> 00:33:13,499
Are you not going to accept the business that fell from the sky?

464
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:17,439
There are so many lately. I can't possibly take them all.

465
00:33:17,948 --> 00:33:20,978
I told Ms. Yi to distribute my interview requests to everyone.

466
00:33:21,691 --> 00:33:23,962
You're going to distribute all of them?

467
00:33:24,161 --> 00:33:27,041
Guan Xiang Cheng's article is completed.

468
00:33:27,129 --> 00:33:29,995
Don't you want to keep a couple of important ones for yourself?

469
00:33:30,521 --> 00:33:32,641
If I have a direction, I can contact them again.

470
00:33:32,722 --> 00:33:34,392
Those people won't run away.

471
00:33:35,529 --> 00:33:36,689
Zheng Shu Yi.

472
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:41,647
Do you know you're just 0.01cm away from that office?

473
00:33:42,691 --> 00:33:45,051
Why are you saying the same thing as Ms. Yi?

474
00:33:45,172 --> 00:33:47,202
We're the ones with normal thinking, okay?

475
00:33:47,382 --> 00:33:49,562
I've added you to the group. Remember to work hard.

476
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,202
Thanks.

477
00:33:58,059 --> 00:33:59,659
Take a look at these interview requests.

478
00:33:59,699 --> 00:34:01,220
If you're interested, let me know.

479
00:34:01,337 --> 00:34:03,682
- Thank you, Shu Yi. - You're welcome.

480
00:34:03,778 --> 00:34:06,077
Thank you, Shu Yi.

481
00:34:07,923 --> 00:34:09,043
Look at her.

482
00:34:09,138 --> 00:34:11,019
She hasn't even become the deputy editor yet,

483
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,770
and she's already assigning tasks to everyone.

484
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:16,400
Thank you, Miss Zheng. Thank you very much.

485
00:34:19,122 --> 00:34:21,637
Mr. Shi, Mr. Qin's interview has been arranged.

486
00:34:22,666 --> 00:34:24,586
Miss Zheng will indeed be quite busy lately.

487
00:34:24,667 --> 00:34:27,420
But she recommended another journalist to me and created a group.

488
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,562
She contacted you

489
00:34:32,707 --> 00:34:34,642
and created a WeChat group for you?

490
00:34:40,451 --> 00:34:41,961
Get ready for the meeting!

491
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,854
Yunchuang has passed Zhanlan's first round of financing screening.

492
00:34:47,924 --> 00:34:50,194
Shi Yan, you've done a good job this time.

493
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,079
Mr. Shi,

494
00:34:53,278 --> 00:34:55,038
the competition is intense.

495
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,589
If we want to secure Zhanlan, we must prepare early.

496
00:34:59,441 --> 00:35:03,427
If we can cooperate with other investment companies to secure Zhanlan,

497
00:35:03,858 --> 00:35:05,528
it could be a solution too.

498
00:35:05,618 --> 00:35:07,442
Investing is about making money.

499
00:35:07,596 --> 00:35:09,739
There's no point in sharing profits without earning them first.

500
00:35:09,763 --> 00:35:11,882
All the shortlisted companies are determined to win.

501
00:35:12,063 --> 00:35:15,602
It may not be easy to get a collaboration with other companies now.

502
00:35:18,022 --> 00:35:20,562
I understand your thoughts and concerns.

503
00:35:20,893 --> 00:35:21,898
Regarding Zhanlan,

504
00:35:21,979 --> 00:35:24,200
we're only in the stage of deciding whether to invest or not.

505
00:35:24,224 --> 00:35:27,134
We can't rush into such a significant investment.

506
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,081
So before the results of the new round of evaluation come out,

507
00:35:30,162 --> 00:35:32,632
I don't approve of making any further moves.

508
00:35:46,521 --> 00:35:49,830
Also, digital currency is becoming more common in our daily lives.

509
00:36:04,358 --> 00:36:06,340
All right, everyone, let's end the class here today.

510
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:07,437
Class dismissed.

511
00:36:12,219 --> 00:36:14,850
Professor Yu, let's have lunch together.

512
00:36:15,684 --> 00:36:17,825
Sorry, I have a class later.

513
00:36:18,939 --> 00:36:21,218
What about after class? I can wait for you.

514
00:36:21,299 --> 00:36:22,512
Mr. Yu.

515
00:36:24,684 --> 00:36:25,826
Sorry.

516
00:36:26,564 --> 00:36:27,800
You haven't eaten, right?

517
00:36:28,329 --> 00:36:30,199
I have quite a few classes this afternoon.

518
00:36:31,764 --> 00:36:33,482
Do you have a girlfriend?

519
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,202
How do you know it belongs to my girlfriend?

520
00:36:38,447 --> 00:36:42,002
Could it really be what I thought?

521
00:36:45,739 --> 00:36:47,242
Yue, you're back.

522
00:36:51,826 --> 00:36:55,467
This article is well-structured, and the ideas are clear.

523
00:36:55,555 --> 00:36:58,235
Bei Er, you've made great progress recently. Keep up the good work.

524
00:36:58,290 --> 00:36:59,790
I will, Yu Ling.

525
00:37:00,861 --> 00:37:04,281
Qin Shi Yue, where have you been? Why are you back so late?

526
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:10,639
Sorry, Yu Ling.

527
00:37:10,785 --> 00:37:12,472
I attended a lecture at the University of Finance and Economics,

528
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:13,842
so I came back late. I...

529
00:37:13,977 --> 00:37:15,962
I asked you and Bei Er to complete the article together,

530
00:37:15,986 --> 00:37:17,325
but you left everything to her.

531
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:18,674
What have you done?

532
00:37:18,793 --> 00:37:20,282
Look at how you wrote this article.

533
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,450
Your words and sentences seem amateurish.

534
00:37:23,002 --> 00:37:25,191
I wonder how Zheng Shu Yi taught you.

535
00:37:26,538 --> 00:37:28,538
It's my fault for coming back late,

536
00:37:28,689 --> 00:37:31,479
but why are you dragging Shu Yi into this when you're scolding me?

537
00:37:32,004 --> 00:37:33,504
You like to be a hero.

538
00:37:34,921 --> 00:37:36,120
Fine.

539
00:37:36,256 --> 00:37:38,326
Let's forget about Zheng Shu Yi and talk about you.

540
00:37:39,274 --> 00:37:41,465
What did you contribute to this article?

541
00:37:42,644 --> 00:37:43,885
Yu Ling.

542
00:37:44,027 --> 00:37:45,619
Yue found the expert.

543
00:37:45,703 --> 00:37:47,150
She also set the structure of the article.

544
00:37:47,174 --> 00:37:48,927
She gave me the structure before she went out.

545
00:37:48,951 --> 00:37:50,700
Can you not interrupt me when I'm talking?

546
00:37:52,776 --> 00:37:54,887
As a senior, can't I teach her?

547
00:37:56,427 --> 00:37:58,868
Since you're so capable, fine.

548
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,162
Go find some industry experts

549
00:38:01,243 --> 00:38:04,202
and have them contribute their views for you newbies to use.

550
00:38:06,899 --> 00:38:09,019
Since the highlight is the expert opinions,

551
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,089
we'll have to revise the structure completely.

552
00:38:11,193 --> 00:38:13,113
Bei Er, it's your turn to set the structure.

553
00:38:13,218 --> 00:38:15,678
So everyone won't say I'm not dividing the tasks fairly.

554
00:38:20,246 --> 00:38:22,566
Okay, I understand.

555
00:38:22,856 --> 00:38:23,965
Good luck.

556
00:38:26,664 --> 00:38:27,842
Yue.

557
00:38:28,856 --> 00:38:30,057
It's all my fault.

558
00:38:30,138 --> 00:38:31,658
I didn't fill in the content properly.

559
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,680
I don't blame you. It's not your problem.

560
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,260
Don't take the blame for the issue.

561
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,910
You've been working hard, Yue.

562
00:39:03,322 --> 00:39:06,443
Nan, when will Shu Yi come back?

563
00:39:06,531 --> 00:39:09,091
She's on an outside assignment these few days. She must be busy.

564
00:39:09,121 --> 00:39:12,071
I messaged her on WeChat and it took a few hours for her to reply.

565
00:39:12,274 --> 00:39:14,154
Forget it, I'd better not bother her.

566
00:39:14,273 --> 00:39:15,863
I don't want to cause trouble for her.

567
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,551
Don't work too late. I'm leaving now. Good luck.

568
00:39:23,641 --> 00:39:25,399
(Can you not interrupt me when I'm talking?)

569
00:39:25,423 --> 00:39:27,442
(As a senior, can't I teach her?)

570
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:39,122
(Uncle, I want to resign! I can't do this anymore!)

571
00:39:39,231 --> 00:39:40,442
(What's wrong?)

572
00:39:42,164 --> 00:39:47,485
Uncle, you have no idea what kind of dire straits I live in.

573
00:39:47,641 --> 00:39:49,656
I'm actually working overtime.

574
00:39:49,737 --> 00:39:53,202
(I'm just a rootless weed living at the mercy of others.)

575
00:39:53,445 --> 00:39:56,880
(My pride as a member of the Shi family is almost non-existent.)

576
00:39:56,961 --> 00:40:00,116
(Uncle, do you know that typing when you're hungry feels like)

577
00:40:00,251 --> 00:40:02,020
(the words are flying off your fingertips?)

578
00:40:02,101 --> 00:40:04,511
My stomach is starting to feel uncomfortable.

579
00:40:04,712 --> 00:40:06,882
I only ate a little biscuit.

580
00:40:07,041 --> 00:40:09,350
I guess I won't be able to hold on for much longer.

581
00:40:14,844 --> 00:40:16,794
(Are you all working overtime?)

582
00:40:17,738 --> 00:40:19,419
I'm the only one working overtime.

583
00:40:19,546 --> 00:40:21,466
My leader didn't come to the magazine today.

584
00:40:21,547 --> 00:40:23,387
(She doesn't even have time to care about me.)

585
00:40:27,345 --> 00:40:28,976
She's not working overtime

586
00:40:29,417 --> 00:40:31,246
and didn't go to the magazine.

587
00:40:33,508 --> 00:40:34,629
Where did she go again?

588
00:40:36,844 --> 00:40:38,796
(Professor Yu, you've finished your classes, right?)

589
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:42,091
(I'm working overtime today. Do you want to have supper together?)

590
00:40:54,114 --> 00:40:56,494
(Professor Yu, are you tired?)

591
00:41:02,618 --> 00:41:05,489
"How do you know it's my girlfriend?"

592
00:41:06,098 --> 00:41:08,167
It turns out I was overthinking.

593
00:41:10,604 --> 00:41:13,034
No, I need to delve deeper into the enemy camp

594
00:41:13,413 --> 00:41:15,883
to find out exactly how many opponents there are.

595
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:21,108
I wonder if he has left yet.

596
00:41:21,409 --> 00:41:22,729
Goodbye, Professor Yu.

597
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:24,099
- Be careful. - Professor Yu, bye.

598
00:41:24,123 --> 00:41:25,249
Let's go buy some water.

599
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:26,642
Professor Yu.

600
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,112
- Miss Qin? - You must be thirsty. Have some water.

601
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,471
No need, I have it.

602
00:41:34,401 --> 00:41:35,736
Have you finished playing basketball?

603
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,602
Let's have dinner together.

604
00:41:38,026 --> 00:41:39,616
I have a question to ask you.

605
00:41:40,058 --> 00:41:42,677
If you have any questions, you can ask me during the class.

606
00:41:42,985 --> 00:41:44,312
No.

607
00:41:45,163 --> 00:41:48,073
It's a matter related to relationships.

608
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,842
Miss Qin, I think you might not know me very well yet.

609
00:41:52,026 --> 00:41:53,616
I'm 30 years old.

610
00:41:54,154 --> 00:41:55,574
- So? - So...

611
00:41:57,011 --> 00:41:59,840
So I may not be suitable to answer your relationship questions.

612
00:42:00,035 --> 00:42:01,545
Why wouldn't you be suitable?

613
00:42:01,866 --> 00:42:03,002
Do you

614
00:42:04,001 --> 00:42:05,501
not like girls?

615
00:42:07,008 --> 00:42:08,767
I have to prepare for my classes. I'll leave now.

616
00:42:08,791 --> 00:42:09,871
Be safe on your way back.

617
00:42:09,952 --> 00:42:12,220
But you haven't answered my question yet.

618
00:42:12,929 --> 00:42:14,001
Whether it's suitable or not

619
00:42:14,025 --> 00:42:16,682
can only be determined after getting to know each other, right?
