00:01:31,322 --> 00:01:36,013
(Only For Love)

2
00:01:36,094 --> 00:01:39,068
(Episode 10)

3
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,842
(Unsubscribe)

4
00:02:16,322 --> 00:02:22,316
(Morning)

5
00:02:22,412 --> 00:02:24,081
Oh, right. We can use WeChat now.

6
00:02:28,363 --> 00:02:31,390
(I have a date today. So, I won't see you.)

7
00:02:31,471 --> 00:02:33,442
(I also have a date today.)

8
00:02:33,512 --> 00:02:34,931
(I won't see you either.)

9
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:40,488
(Morning! Sending you a heart.)

10
00:02:40,606 --> 00:02:42,962
(Don't forget the concert tonight.)

11
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:52,249
(Want to have dinner together?)

12
00:02:53,664 --> 00:02:56,107
Well, maybe not. Better not overdo it.

13
00:02:56,188 --> 00:02:57,978
I don't want to push my luck.

14
00:04:29,688 --> 00:04:32,209
Please line up and enter in an orderly manner.

15
00:04:32,316 --> 00:04:34,947
Please line up and enter in an orderly manner.

16
00:04:59,657 --> 00:05:01,322
What a coincidence.

17
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,728
Coincidence?

18
00:05:03,163 --> 00:05:04,962
Weren't you the one who invited me?

19
00:05:05,745 --> 00:05:07,125
I invited you?

20
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,709
The one I invited is...

21
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:11,059
(Hang on.)

22
00:05:11,163 --> 00:05:12,457
(Shi Yan.)

23
00:05:12,538 --> 00:05:14,038
(SY.)

24
00:05:14,376 --> 00:05:16,286
(SY.)

25
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,032
(It's Shi Yue?)

26
00:05:19,642 --> 00:05:21,482
I was just joking.

27
00:05:21,562 --> 00:05:24,032
I was about to urge you, and here you are.

28
00:05:25,155 --> 00:05:27,116
That's quite a coincidence.

29
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,792
That's what I said.

30
00:05:30,123 --> 00:05:31,889
Shall we go in?

31
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,682
Sure, let's go.

32
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,781
What's wrong?

33
00:07:27,442 --> 00:07:29,802
This song is really sad.

34
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:31,382
It makes me feel so sad.

35
00:07:31,463 --> 00:07:32,643
So sad.

36
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:39,924
Shu Yi, did you just go through a breakup?

37
00:07:40,005 --> 00:07:42,282
Is that why you're feeling emotional?

38
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,882
We broke up a month ago.

39
00:07:46,963 --> 00:07:48,842
He totally cheated on me.

40
00:07:48,986 --> 00:07:51,082
But I'm not emotional because of that.

41
00:07:51,483 --> 00:07:52,643
I'm just thinking,

42
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:54,122
when you experience a breakup,

43
00:07:54,202 --> 00:07:56,203
it shouldn't be women feeling devastated,

44
00:07:56,283 --> 00:07:58,513
the scumbags should go screw themselves.

45
00:08:00,098 --> 00:08:01,928
You're absolutely right.

46
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,280
But, Shu Yi, with your looks,

47
00:08:07,363 --> 00:08:09,042
I can't believe you got cheated on.

48
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,929
You're very beautiful.

49
00:08:13,043 --> 00:08:14,262
I know, right?

50
00:08:14,417 --> 00:08:16,288
But it still happened.

51
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:19,538
It's because that guy was blind.

52
00:08:19,619 --> 00:08:21,459
He cares more about money than appearances.

53
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,508
The rich girl he's after has a very wealthy uncle.

54
00:08:29,162 --> 00:08:30,503
Shu Yi,

55
00:08:31,123 --> 00:08:32,602
you're handling this so gracefully.

56
00:08:32,696 --> 00:08:34,196
I really admire you.

57
00:08:36,571 --> 00:08:38,362
However, after getting along with her uncle,

58
00:08:38,443 --> 00:08:41,193
I'm starting to realize that he is actually quite nice.

59
00:08:41,611 --> 00:08:43,651
So now, I'm kind of torn.

60
00:08:43,778 --> 00:08:45,529
What are you waiting for then?

61
00:08:47,955 --> 00:08:49,875
Let me tell you, don't overthink it.

62
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:51,843
You've already lost your ex,

63
00:08:51,924 --> 00:08:54,143
don't lose this new guy too.

64
00:08:55,691 --> 00:08:58,762
But he's not immoral like his niece, right?

65
00:08:59,682 --> 00:09:03,595
No, he's nothing like his niece at all.

66
00:10:18,428 --> 00:10:20,307
Shu Yi, I'm going home.

67
00:10:20,388 --> 00:10:22,688
- Okay, drive safe.   - Bye-bye.

68
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,979
(Professor Yu?)

69
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:58,267
(Is he a fan of Mom too?)

70
00:11:03,882 --> 00:11:05,612
Mom, can you give me

71
00:11:05,693 --> 00:11:08,628
some of those limited edition albums from when you debuted?

72
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,602
The limited edition ones. The kind you can't find in stores.

73
00:11:22,203 --> 00:11:23,223
Shu Yi?

74
00:11:23,819 --> 00:11:24,882
What a coincidence.

75
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,691
Professor Yu, what are the odds of running into you here?

76
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,141
Shi Yan gave me the ticket, so I came to chill.

77
00:11:32,603 --> 00:11:34,364
You've seen the interview outline.

78
00:11:34,482 --> 00:11:36,601
Can we set the time for the interview this week?

79
00:11:36,682 --> 00:11:40,268
No problem. How about next Tuesday at 3pm?

80
00:11:40,349 --> 00:11:41,722
Sounds good.

81
00:11:42,028 --> 00:11:43,282
Let me give you a ride home.

82
00:11:43,363 --> 00:11:44,882
It's fine. I've called a cab.

83
00:11:44,963 --> 00:11:46,563
Okay then. Stay safe.

84
00:11:46,644 --> 00:11:47,785
Bye.

85
00:12:37,249 --> 00:12:38,929
(Since you came to me, )

86
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,260
(I might as well take the chance and stage a little accident.)

87
00:12:56,849 --> 00:13:00,002
Mr. Shi, I sprained my ankle.

88
00:13:02,963 --> 00:13:04,673
It's all because of you.

89
00:13:04,802 --> 00:13:06,553
You should take responsibility.

90
00:13:07,882 --> 00:13:09,022
Why should I?

91
00:13:10,955 --> 00:13:14,602
Because every time I see you, I can't focus on the road anymore.

92
00:13:32,724 --> 00:13:34,995
(Miss, where are you?)

93
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:37,642
Stay there. I'll go to you.

94
00:13:46,143 --> 00:13:49,602
Shi Yan! Are you serious? Shi Yan!

95
00:13:56,788 --> 00:14:00,722
Oh, heavens, why am I so unlucky?

96
00:14:16,049 --> 00:14:18,282
Shi Yan, you heartless man.

97
00:14:18,587 --> 00:14:20,336
You are uncaring.

98
00:14:21,076 --> 00:14:22,464
Am I not beautiful?

99
00:14:22,603 --> 00:14:23,943
Am I not pitiable?

100
00:14:24,896 --> 00:14:26,491
Your eyes aren't just nearsighted.

101
00:14:26,572 --> 00:14:28,841
They're designed to avoid good-looking people.

102
00:14:29,971 --> 00:14:34,268
Someone like you should grow old alone! Without...

103
00:14:38,443 --> 00:14:40,882
Go on, what else?

104
00:14:41,123 --> 00:14:43,152
Someone like me should what? Without what?

105
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:46,902
Mr. Shi,

106
00:14:47,282 --> 00:14:51,282
I think I can explain to you in the car. Don't you think?

107
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:05,103
You haven't come up with an explanation yet?

108
00:15:06,548 --> 00:15:08,298
What's the rush?

109
00:15:09,163 --> 00:15:11,903
Even a test gives you ninety minutes to answer.

110
00:15:21,332 --> 00:15:23,601
Ouch.

111
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,969
I'm sure I've injured my bone.

112
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,242
It hurts so much.

113
00:15:28,745 --> 00:15:31,962
Yet you can still talk so much.

114
00:15:39,232 --> 00:15:45,200
(Outpatient)

115
00:15:58,314 --> 00:16:00,922
Get out. Let's get you to the doctor and have your bone checked.

116
00:16:01,363 --> 00:16:02,602
My foot hurts.

117
00:16:02,682 --> 00:16:05,313
I can't stand up, and I definitely can't walk.

118
00:16:06,543 --> 00:16:08,742
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have sprained my ankle.

119
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,282
You should take responsibility for this.

120
00:16:10,378 --> 00:16:12,962
Zheng Shu Yi, stop exaggerating.

121
00:16:13,508 --> 00:16:14,948
I'm not exaggerating.

122
00:16:15,029 --> 00:16:16,628
Can't you be a bit more considerate?

123
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:18,322
Is your heart made of stone, Mr. Shi?

124
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,419
No.

125
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:21,992
- Then...   - You said it yourself, I don't have a heart.

126
00:16:22,632 --> 00:16:24,231
Why are you so petty?

127
00:16:24,342 --> 00:16:26,452
Try wearing these shoes and spraining your ankle.

128
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:28,467
It's as painful as having your ankle broken.

129
00:16:28,548 --> 00:16:30,048
Excruciatingly painful, okay?

130
00:16:31,953 --> 00:16:34,453
You've never worn them, so you wouldn't understand.

131
00:17:37,363 --> 00:17:39,243
Did your ex-girlfriend ever tell you

132
00:17:39,323 --> 00:17:41,482
that you look handsome from this angle?

133
00:17:42,764 --> 00:17:44,962
Did your ex-boyfriend ever tell you

134
00:17:45,226 --> 00:17:46,722
that you're heavy?

135
00:17:47,363 --> 00:17:48,702
No way.

136
00:17:50,642 --> 00:17:52,349
Nobody has ever carried me like this.

137
00:17:52,434 --> 00:17:54,955
But I think you have the potential

138
00:17:55,036 --> 00:17:56,976
to be the first boyfriend to say that.

139
00:18:02,188 --> 00:18:04,122
Ouch!

140
00:18:05,827 --> 00:18:08,322
Does it hurt that much? I didn't apply much pressure.

141
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:11,242
I'm really sensitive to pain. It hurts so much.

142
00:18:18,221 --> 00:18:19,562
Hello, Sister.

143
00:18:28,237 --> 00:18:30,802
So, it was just an act to make him feel bad for you.

144
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,042
Well, not exactly.

145
00:18:34,203 --> 00:18:36,362
I knew it, it couldn't have hurt that much.

146
00:18:37,227 --> 00:18:39,187
When you get home, put ice packs on it for 48 hours.

147
00:18:39,268 --> 00:18:40,507
If it still hurts,

148
00:18:40,595 --> 00:18:42,236
apply some medicine to improve blood circulation.

149
00:18:42,323 --> 00:18:44,082
Try not to move around. Got it?

150
00:18:44,163 --> 00:18:45,642
Thank you, doctor.

151
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,460
I must say,

152
00:18:48,788 --> 00:18:51,008
your boyfriend, although quite handsome,

153
00:18:51,099 --> 00:18:54,322
seems a bit unromantic and stony-hearted.

154
00:18:54,623 --> 00:18:56,543
Don't say that, doctor.

155
00:18:56,624 --> 00:18:58,574
He's not stony-hearted.

156
00:19:01,731 --> 00:19:03,602
Young lady, you're quite protective of him.

157
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,018
He simply doesn't have a heart.

158
00:19:15,283 --> 00:19:16,912
What's taking him so long?

159
00:19:16,993 --> 00:19:18,983
He must've gone to pay the bills.

160
00:19:21,442 --> 00:19:23,152
He wouldn't have left, would he?

161
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:00,103
I still can't walk.

162
00:20:33,256 --> 00:20:35,002
A medical miracle.

163
00:20:35,155 --> 00:20:36,842
The doctor did a good job.

164
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:41,154
Can you get in the car by yourself now?

165
00:21:12,263 --> 00:21:13,682
(Guan Ji)

166
00:21:17,131 --> 00:21:21,282
(Shi Yan, are you still in touch with Bei Lin?)

167
00:21:21,634 --> 00:21:25,495
(Your ex, that actress, the really pretty one.)

168
00:21:27,682 --> 00:21:28,882
(Here's the thing, )

169
00:21:28,963 --> 00:21:30,762
(I have a friend who wants to cast her in a movie.)

170
00:21:30,843 --> 00:21:33,593
(If you don't mind, could you help introduce them to each other?)

171
00:21:38,232 --> 00:21:39,993
(Hello, can you hear me?)

172
00:21:40,922 --> 00:21:42,023
Her?

173
00:21:42,162 --> 00:21:43,912
I think her acting skills are just average.

174
00:21:46,993 --> 00:21:48,983
The one in my car right now is a much better actress.

175
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:52,685
(Seriously?)

176
00:21:54,043 --> 00:21:55,522
(In your car?)

177
00:21:56,323 --> 00:21:58,242
(I won't disturb you. Bye.)

178
00:22:19,178 --> 00:22:22,608
So, his ex really is that famous actress.

179
00:22:26,043 --> 00:22:27,222
His ex...

180
00:22:29,284 --> 00:22:31,754
When he said I'm a better actress in the car,

181
00:22:32,154 --> 00:22:34,042
can I interpret it as him thinking

182
00:22:34,162 --> 00:22:35,753
I'm better than her?

183
00:22:44,827 --> 00:22:46,802
Anyway, she's just his ex.

184
00:22:46,922 --> 00:22:48,382
I've come so far now.

185
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:52,063
I can't give up now, no matter what.

186
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,360
You're doing this on purpose.

187
00:22:58,442 --> 00:22:59,747
You knew your uncle doesn't like hotpot.

188
00:22:59,828 --> 00:23:01,602
How do you know...

189
00:23:02,242 --> 00:23:03,442
Shi Yan.

190
00:23:03,564 --> 00:23:06,264
Uncle, we're almost done eating, and you just arrived?

191
00:23:06,345 --> 00:23:08,042
I had some things to take care of.

192
00:23:08,248 --> 00:23:10,642
You told me not to forget, and then you arrived so late.

193
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:11,742
Yue,

194
00:23:11,938 --> 00:23:13,858
I haven't seen you in such a long time.

195
00:23:13,939 --> 00:23:15,970
I don't want to see you being scolded by your uncle now.

196
00:23:21,005 --> 00:23:24,642
Carry on with your story. What's going on between you and your superior?

197
00:23:24,723 --> 00:23:27,283
Oh, Uncle knows about this too.

198
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,844
I misunderstood her.

199
00:23:28,925 --> 00:23:30,765
I sent her a friend request on WeChat to apologize to her.

200
00:23:30,846 --> 00:23:34,324
Unexpectedly, as soon as she accepted it, she greeted me passionately

201
00:23:34,405 --> 00:23:35,638
and even invited me to your concert.

202
00:23:35,719 --> 00:23:37,138
I was so surprised.

203
00:23:39,336 --> 00:23:41,256
She invited you to the concert today?

204
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:42,417
That's right.

205
00:23:42,523 --> 00:23:43,989
But she acted a little strange,

206
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:46,085
like I wasn't the one she invited.

207
00:23:46,198 --> 00:23:48,531
But it doesn't matter, we had a great time.

208
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,762
You misunderstood her,

209
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,190
and then went to a concert with her without feeling guilty?

210
00:23:57,307 --> 00:23:59,802
Uncle, why are you so sarcastic?

211
00:23:59,906 --> 00:24:01,327
Always holding grudges.

212
00:24:02,499 --> 00:24:05,459
Sister, here's to your successful performance.

213
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,210
- Cheers.   - Cheers.

214
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,320
(I almost forgot.)

215
00:24:21,408 --> 00:24:23,628
(I haven't paid you back for the medical bills.)

216
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:28,842
Mom, Uncle is dating an actress again.

217
00:24:28,987 --> 00:24:30,082
Don't talk nonsense.

218
00:24:30,163 --> 00:24:32,714
Guan Ji said you had an actress in your car.

219
00:24:32,992 --> 00:24:34,972
I just saw her sending you a message.

220
00:24:35,114 --> 00:24:37,042
Shi Yan, who is it?

221
00:24:37,178 --> 00:24:38,219
Do I know her?

222
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,462
Sister, they are making things up. Don't mind them.

223
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,630
I clearly saw it just now.

224
00:24:43,701 --> 00:24:45,778
Okay, don't believe rumors so easily.

225
00:24:45,868 --> 00:24:47,816
Gossip spreads this way.

226
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,670
Your uncle knows what he's doing.

227
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:52,956
But when it comes to relationships,

228
00:24:53,037 --> 00:24:55,042
you can only keep them if you cherish them.

229
00:24:55,169 --> 00:24:56,212
Shi Yan,

230
00:24:56,336 --> 00:24:57,816
if you meet the right girl,

231
00:24:57,923 --> 00:25:00,143
make sure to cherish her and don't lose her.

232
00:25:02,202 --> 00:25:05,396
Oh right, isn't Uncle Cheng having a family banquet tomorrow night?

233
00:25:05,499 --> 00:25:08,688
If you don't have a date, let Yue go with you.

234
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,701
It's fine.

235
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:15,125
Uncle, I'd be happy to go with you.

236
00:25:15,206 --> 00:25:17,722
Not anyone can be my uncle's date.

237
00:25:18,202 --> 00:25:20,592
Tone it down now.

238
00:25:25,155 --> 00:25:26,418
Sister, enjoy your meal.

239
00:25:26,499 --> 00:25:27,618
I need to use the restroom.

240
00:25:27,699 --> 00:25:28,800
Okay.

241
00:25:32,091 --> 00:25:33,841
There's something going on with him.

242
00:25:33,926 --> 00:25:36,242
All right now. Just eat your food.

243
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:40,579
(He seems to be in love.)

244
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,830
(I have to find out which actress it is.)

245
00:26:11,491 --> 00:26:13,322
(Are you Shi Yan?)

246
00:26:19,563 --> 00:26:21,122
(Who else could I be?)

247
00:26:26,145 --> 00:26:27,628
(How much was the medical bill?)

248
00:26:27,709 --> 00:26:29,276
(I'll transfer it to you.)

249
00:26:34,042 --> 00:26:36,822
What kind of hospital is this? It's so expensive.

250
00:26:38,922 --> 00:26:40,872
(Can I use medical insurance?)

251
00:26:50,681 --> 00:26:52,431
(How kind of you.)

252
00:26:53,033 --> 00:26:55,023
(Consider it today's paycheck.)

253
00:26:55,516 --> 00:26:57,055
For my Oscar-level performance,

254
00:26:57,136 --> 00:26:58,767
you're only paying a little over 2,000?

255
00:26:59,988 --> 00:27:03,700
What a stingy character you are.

256
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,840
(For my Oscar-level performance, )

257
00:27:05,938 --> 00:27:07,742
(you're only paying a little over 2,000?)

258
00:27:07,865 --> 00:27:09,365
(How much do you want?)

259
00:27:12,433 --> 00:27:14,922
(I want you to have dinner with me tomorrow.)

260
00:27:15,155 --> 00:27:17,065
That's quite a thing to ask.

261
00:27:25,322 --> 00:27:29,882
(Sure. I'll pick you up tomorrow at 5pm.)

262
00:27:44,323 --> 00:27:46,402
(What are we going to eat?)

263
00:27:46,523 --> 00:27:48,632
(Which of these should I wear?)

264
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:57,346
(Which outfit looks nice on me?)

265
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:02,172
(The red one.)

266
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,900
Red?

267
00:28:05,698 --> 00:28:07,242
Where did red come from?

268
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:11,759
Is he just humoring me,

269
00:28:11,847 --> 00:28:13,396
or is he colorblind?

270
00:28:17,249 --> 00:28:20,641
He couldn't possibly mean that red one, could he?

271
00:28:55,812 --> 00:28:58,322
Xing Zhou, is this dress nice?

272
00:28:58,641 --> 00:28:59,901
It looks pretty nice.

273
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,802
(What is he doing here?)

274
00:29:07,003 --> 00:29:08,562
- Hello.   - (Hi, Shu Yi.)

275
00:29:08,642 --> 00:29:10,882
(What are you doing? Want to go shopping with me?)

276
00:29:10,963 --> 00:29:12,282
I'm already out shopping.

277
00:29:12,402 --> 00:29:14,043
I even saw that cheater and his girlfriend.

278
00:29:14,123 --> 00:29:15,283
What bad luck.

279
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,122
(Really? Where are you now?)

280
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,082
I'm at Guojin.

281
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,841
I have the worst luck.

282
00:29:21,995 --> 00:29:23,515
Every time I see them,

283
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:25,436
I have to wash my eyes for days.

284
00:29:25,523 --> 00:29:26,942
(Guojin...)

285
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,562
(Wait for me, I'm coming.)

286
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,842
This dress feels a bit too plain, doesn't it?

287
00:29:35,962 --> 00:29:38,283
It looks like something for middle-aged people. It's not for me.

288
00:29:38,363 --> 00:29:39,755
Your choice isn't good either.

289
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,630
A turtleneck sweater can easily smudge my foundation.

290
00:29:42,803 --> 00:29:44,002
Pick another one.

291
00:29:44,162 --> 00:29:45,793
"It smudges my foundation."

292
00:29:50,363 --> 00:29:52,362
Isn't this dress a bit too simple?

293
00:29:52,443 --> 00:29:53,742
It lacks any design flair.

294
00:29:53,823 --> 00:29:57,042
Not at all. Simple tailoring makes it look elegant and attractive.

295
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,562
See, the bright red color complements your complexion.

296
00:29:59,642 --> 00:30:00,842
Chinese New Year is coming up,

297
00:30:00,922 --> 00:30:02,922
and this would be perfect for visiting relatives.

298
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,242
But I still feel there's something off about the shoulder area.

299
00:30:08,661 --> 00:30:09,721
Xing Zhou.

300
00:30:11,323 --> 00:30:12,583
Xing Zhou?

301
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,580
Do I look good in this?

302
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,741
Yes.

303
00:30:20,048 --> 00:30:22,162
Forget it. I'll try something else.

304
00:30:46,114 --> 00:30:48,675
Miss, this outfit is absolutely perfect for you.

305
00:30:48,849 --> 00:30:50,569
Your skin is so fair.

306
00:30:50,747 --> 00:30:54,267
This bright red color seems tailor-made for someone with your skin tone.

307
00:30:54,369 --> 00:30:57,118
You look even better than magazine models in it.

308
00:30:57,843 --> 00:30:58,902
Thank you.

309
00:30:59,682 --> 00:31:01,742
I'd like to take a photo to show my friend.

310
00:31:06,432 --> 00:31:08,617
Solid-state batteries have become one of the key bottlenecks

311
00:31:08,698 --> 00:31:11,763
restricting the development of the new energy vehicle industry.

312
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,482
The industry is about to witness

313
00:31:13,603 --> 00:31:15,602
the emergence of semi-solid-state batteries.

314
00:31:15,736 --> 00:31:17,649
Zhanlan is the most likely company to be the first

315
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:19,482
to mass-produce semi-solid-state batteries.

316
00:31:19,625 --> 00:31:22,322
This round of financing holds great significance for them.

317
00:31:22,768 --> 00:31:25,322
Zhanlan's semi-solid-state batteries have very mature technology.

318
00:31:25,403 --> 00:31:27,083
Currently, they are considered leaders in the new generation

319
00:31:27,164 --> 00:31:28,804
of high-performance power batteries.

320
00:31:29,722 --> 00:31:31,923
All right then. You've all done your homework.

321
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:33,282
I can only respond to the call

322
00:31:33,363 --> 00:31:36,283
and contribute to the national dual carbon goal.

323
00:31:42,856 --> 00:31:43,896
(Is it nice?)

324
00:31:43,977 --> 00:31:45,606
(Give me a one-word response.)

325
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,741
Are you smiling?

326
00:31:49,854 --> 00:31:51,114
Why are you smiling?

327
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,219
Nothing.

328
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,555
So, do you have a date for the evening?

329
00:32:04,825 --> 00:32:07,004
I can go with you. I don't have a date.

330
00:32:08,962 --> 00:32:11,128
I'm not going with you.

331
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,950
That's interesting.

332
00:32:17,173 --> 00:32:18,804
You don't have a date tonight,

333
00:32:19,351 --> 00:32:20,730
and he unexpectedly does.

334
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:23,742
Yeah.

335
00:32:25,722 --> 00:32:27,042
(Acceptable.)

336
00:32:27,219 --> 00:32:29,059
(Couldn't he have added a few more words?)

337
00:32:29,162 --> 00:32:31,112
(Would it kill him to say "you look beautiful"?)

338
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:41,162
So ugly.

339
00:32:41,393 --> 00:32:42,962
Get me something else.

340
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:15,652
Honey, I like all of these. Buy them for me.

341
00:33:17,883 --> 00:33:21,042
Hurry up, we have to go to dinner later.

342
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:31,315
Miss, do you want all of these outfits?

343
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:33,882
They look great on you. They suit you well.

344
00:33:37,517 --> 00:33:38,616
Shu Yi.

345
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,042
Have you made your picks?

346
00:33:51,705 --> 00:33:53,922
Don't overthink it. I'll help you choose.

347
00:33:58,355 --> 00:34:00,882
Ma'am, excuse me.

348
00:34:01,346 --> 00:34:02,991
Your taste is really on point.

349
00:34:03,072 --> 00:34:05,114
You've picked out the ugliest pieces in the store for me.

350
00:34:05,235 --> 00:34:06,866
You've saved me from wasting time.

351
00:34:09,595 --> 00:34:10,796
Are you really going to buy them?

352
00:34:10,883 --> 00:34:12,122
Of course.

353
00:34:12,203 --> 00:34:14,468
- I don't feel right about it.   - What's not right about it?

354
00:34:14,588 --> 00:34:17,122
It's my uncle's supplementary card. It's fine, don't worry.

355
00:34:17,202 --> 00:34:19,842
That's even wrong. I don't even know your uncle.

356
00:34:19,923 --> 00:34:22,882
You said you wanted them. You can't change your mind now.

357
00:34:22,963 --> 00:34:25,962
You have to maintain your pride at times like this.

358
00:34:26,486 --> 00:34:29,602
Consider it a return gift for taking me to the concert before,

359
00:34:29,761 --> 00:34:32,762
and compensation for some other things.

360
00:34:33,123 --> 00:34:34,463
What other things?

361
00:34:35,571 --> 00:34:37,482
Nothing, forget it.

362
00:34:39,603 --> 00:34:42,362
Shu Yi, consumerism will never betray you.

363
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:45,028
The clothes you buy are yours, forever yours.

364
00:34:45,115 --> 00:34:47,322
Much more reliable than certain men, for sure.

365
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:50,059
Miss, it's done.

366
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,739
Thank you.

367
00:34:53,043 --> 00:34:54,463
Ma'am, thank you.

368
00:34:56,483 --> 00:34:58,282
What the hell is wrong with you?

369
00:34:58,427 --> 00:34:59,866
That's enough.

370
00:35:00,076 --> 00:35:02,536
These few pieces really aren't that nice. Forget about them. Let's go.

371
00:35:02,617 --> 00:35:03,818
They aren't nice?

372
00:35:03,949 --> 00:35:05,740
Your eyes were practically glued to them

373
00:35:05,821 --> 00:35:07,442
when she was wearing them just now.

374
00:35:07,603 --> 00:35:09,402
She's nothing!

375
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:13,922
Shu Yi,

376
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,682
put on the one you like.

377
00:35:21,539 --> 00:35:22,914
Shu Yi, do you have plans for later?

378
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:24,274
How about dinner together?

379
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,061
Sorry, I've made plans with someone.

380
00:35:27,148 --> 00:35:29,042
I see.

381
00:35:29,171 --> 00:35:30,812
That's why you're out shopping for clothes.

382
00:35:30,938 --> 00:35:32,058
Smart.

383
00:35:32,139 --> 00:35:34,242
You should head off then. What are you waiting for?

384
00:35:34,344 --> 00:35:36,145
Go on, good luck.

385
00:35:52,551 --> 00:35:55,653
This outfit seems a bit too much.

386
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,719
Zheng Shu Yi.

387
00:36:16,115 --> 00:36:17,642
Where are you going?

388
00:36:18,283 --> 00:36:21,756
I'm going home to drop these off and change my clothes.

389
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:24,762
No need to change.

390
00:36:24,963 --> 00:36:26,722
You look great in this.

391
00:36:48,676 --> 00:36:51,482
He was holding my hand and praising me before getting into the car,

392
00:36:51,563 --> 00:36:53,482
but now he's silent.

393
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:55,600
Men can be so fickle.

394
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:10,052
(Langyuan)

395
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,634
This courtyard has quite a distinctive charm.

396
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,180
Let's go inside.

397
00:37:26,508 --> 00:37:29,922
(I didn't know he could be so good at choosing a place for a date.)

398
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:36,067
What are you looking at?

399
00:37:36,148 --> 00:37:37,289
You.

400
00:37:38,014 --> 00:37:39,722
What about me?

401
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:42,282
You look different today.

402
00:37:42,676 --> 00:37:44,282
You look very beautiful.

403
00:37:51,955 --> 00:37:53,442
It's time to join the banquet.

404
00:37:54,074 --> 00:37:55,442
The banquet?

405
00:37:56,083 --> 00:37:57,724
This is a family banquet hosted by one of my elders.

406
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:00,010
There should be quite a crowd later.

407
00:38:01,192 --> 00:38:03,781
Aren't you supposed to have dinner with me?

408
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:06,800
Isn't this considered having dinner with you?

409
00:38:08,813 --> 00:38:10,072
Okay.

410
00:38:10,883 --> 00:38:13,433
This is not the kind of dinner I had in mind.

411
00:38:16,228 --> 00:38:18,002
After this meal,

412
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,762
you can invite me for a private meal, just the two of us.

413
00:38:28,842 --> 00:38:30,063
Let's go.

414
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,882
(Shi Yan is seeing someone again.)

415
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,024
(How long has he been single?)

416
00:38:47,105 --> 00:38:49,282
(Why did he break up with Bei Lin before?)

417
00:38:49,372 --> 00:38:50,922
(Who dumped whom?)

418
00:38:51,686 --> 00:38:53,322
- (Who's she?)   - (Is this his new girlfriend?)

419
00:38:53,405 --> 00:38:55,882
(Judging by her look, she's probably a celebrity too.)

420
00:38:56,509 --> 00:39:00,402
- (I've never seen her before.)   - (I think she's as pretty as Bei Lin.)

421
00:39:00,531 --> 00:39:02,690
Shi Yan, it's been so long.

422
00:39:02,802 --> 00:39:03,802
Yes.

423
00:39:04,322 --> 00:39:06,523
I haven't been paying much attention to the entertainment industry lately.

424
00:39:06,603 --> 00:39:08,322
Who is this?

425
00:39:08,435 --> 00:39:09,674
I remember now.

426
00:39:09,755 --> 00:39:11,515
Aren't you the lead actress

427
00:39:11,596 --> 00:39:14,122
from that web series "Princess Qin Lan"?

428
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:17,130
It's really you! I used to say that the lead actress was very beautiful,

429
00:39:17,211 --> 00:39:19,602
but you look even more stunning in modern attire.

430
00:39:20,603 --> 00:39:22,642
Sorry, guys. You got the wrong person.

431
00:39:22,723 --> 00:39:24,082
I'm a journalist.

432
00:39:24,974 --> 00:39:26,643
Oh, we're sorry.

433
00:39:29,423 --> 00:39:30,543
Let's go.

434
00:39:30,682 --> 00:39:32,688
(He just spent the night with an actress yesterday, )

435
00:39:32,769 --> 00:39:35,082
(and today he's with a beautiful journalist.)

436
00:39:35,282 --> 00:39:37,802
(The runaway prince is quite the ladies' man, isn't he?)

437
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:55,733
What's the matter?

438
00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:58,921
You're still thinking about her?

439
00:39:59,735 --> 00:40:00,816
That's nonsense.

440
00:40:00,929 --> 00:40:03,161
You know it's not nonsense.

441
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,962
I saw it clearly today.

442
00:40:05,155 --> 00:40:07,463
You've never looked at me that way.

443
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:12,097
She and I are past tense. It's not what you think.

444
00:40:12,272 --> 00:40:14,162
You didn't even buy me clothes.

445
00:40:14,249 --> 00:40:15,289
I think you just don't love me.

446
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:17,231
You're reluctant to spend money on me, aren't you?

447
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,096
That's not true.

448
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,742
I was just saving up for our future.

449
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,120
Look, once you talk to your uncle

450
00:40:26,201 --> 00:40:27,561
and get me a job at Yunchuang,

451
00:40:27,696 --> 00:40:30,165
I'll buy you whatever you want, okay?

452
00:40:34,108 --> 00:40:36,018
Let's have a drink.

453
00:40:36,145 --> 00:40:37,366
Cheers.

454
00:40:37,481 --> 00:40:38,942
Thank you.

455
00:40:56,689 --> 00:40:58,560
(Shu Yi, are you busy?)

456
00:40:58,899 --> 00:41:00,379
(I'm sorry about today.)

457
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,089
(I want to talk to you about something.)

458
00:41:04,923 --> 00:41:07,122
(Shu Yi, are you busy? What are you doing right now?)

459
00:41:28,297 --> 00:41:29,701
(I'm baking a cake.)

460
00:41:37,715 --> 00:41:39,242
Is she okay?

461
00:41:39,857 --> 00:41:40,957
She's fine.

462
00:41:42,218 --> 00:41:44,009
She's probably craving for desserts.

463
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,750
(Some people are alive, but they are dead inside.)

464
00:41:54,618 --> 00:41:56,584
Hi, may I know who ordered this?

465
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,821
Here.

466
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,993
Well, someone here wants cake.

467
00:42:09,459 --> 00:42:10,642
(Shi Yan, )

468
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:13,482
(I can't believe you're subtly mocking me in front of so many people.)
