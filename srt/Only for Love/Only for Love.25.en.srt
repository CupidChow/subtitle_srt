1
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,030
(Only for Love)

2
00:01:36,111 --> 00:01:38,995
(Episode 25)

3
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,562
Are you done?

4
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,561
I suddenly feel so hungry.

5
00:02:09,642 --> 00:02:11,491
I'm so hungry that I don't have the energy to go home.

6
00:02:11,515 --> 00:02:14,629
My body can only last for 20 minutes.

7
00:02:15,918 --> 00:02:18,868
Then, I'll be there in 20 minutes.

8
00:02:26,998 --> 00:02:28,362
(Shi Yan.)

9
00:02:28,464 --> 00:02:30,714
(When I tell you all this, )

10
00:02:31,156 --> 00:02:32,926
(you must believe me.)

11
00:03:03,035 --> 00:03:04,646
Hello, sir.

12
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:08,965
Are you here to have dinner with Miss Zheng Shu Yi?

13
00:03:12,219 --> 00:03:13,618
(Didn't you just arrive?)

14
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:14,895
(It's so cold.)

15
00:03:14,976 --> 00:03:16,786
(Why is the car roof cold?)

16
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,402
What's wrong?

17
00:03:21,391 --> 00:03:22,602
Nothing.

18
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:26,014
I'm so hungry. I don't have the strength to open the door.

19
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:58,595
I bought something on the way here. Make do with this first.

20
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,802
(He was waiting for me downstairs all this time.)

21
00:04:04,933 --> 00:04:07,303
(And, he even bought me a milk tea.)

22
00:04:08,755 --> 00:04:10,055
(Shi Yan.)

23
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:11,802
(You're so nice to me.)

24
00:04:11,901 --> 00:04:13,762
(I can't resist you anymore.)

25
00:04:18,156 --> 00:04:19,242
Yi.

26
00:04:19,323 --> 00:04:22,517
If you miss this bottle of select wine,

27
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,009
you will definitely regret it.

28
00:04:25,108 --> 00:04:26,642
You don't want to leave yourself

29
00:04:26,723 --> 00:04:28,452
a regret at the end of the year, right?

30
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,492
I'm afraid I'll be too indulgent and affect tomorrow's work.

31
00:04:34,788 --> 00:04:36,998
This is the last working day of the year.

32
00:04:38,507 --> 00:04:40,918
The problems of this year have to be solved this year.

33
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,370
Only then, can we have a good start next year.

34
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:50,397
Can the problems of this year be solved this year?

35
00:04:53,387 --> 00:04:54,877
Xiang Cheng.

36
00:04:55,936 --> 00:04:57,665
You bet with me last time

37
00:04:57,988 --> 00:04:59,548
and lost, right?

38
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:01,236
So, you still owe me, right?

39
00:05:03,368 --> 00:05:06,322
- Hurry up. - Why are you acting like a kid?

40
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:15,957
We solved the problems of this year perfectly.

41
00:05:16,147 --> 00:05:19,107
Let's solve new problems together next year.

42
00:05:21,147 --> 00:05:22,547
I wish you all the best

43
00:05:23,548 --> 00:05:25,522
for next year,

44
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,162
and all the problems will be solved.

45
00:05:29,308 --> 00:05:30,824
Wish you all the best too.

46
00:05:30,905 --> 00:05:32,042
Try it.

47
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,282
(It's really impressive.)

48
00:05:46,504 --> 00:05:48,879
(I can finally arrange this for my parents now.)

49
00:05:52,484 --> 00:05:54,602
Finally, it's the holiday!

50
00:05:55,518 --> 00:05:57,025
Shu Yi and Yue.

51
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,322
Shall we go out tonight to celebrate? I'll pay.

52
00:06:02,387 --> 00:06:03,936
Let's wait until the holidays are over.

53
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,483
I'll be back in Qing'an tomorrow morning.

54
00:06:05,507 --> 00:06:07,867
I still have to go out tonight to buy gifts for my parents.

55
00:06:08,308 --> 00:06:09,602
What about you?

56
00:06:10,092 --> 00:06:11,542
I have something to do too.

57
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,442
All right then.

58
00:06:16,156 --> 00:06:17,636
I love holidays,

59
00:06:17,717 --> 00:06:19,522
but they are a little too long.

60
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,122
Nan, what are you talking about?

61
00:06:22,226 --> 00:06:23,842
Have you been possessed by Shu Yi?

62
00:06:23,947 --> 00:06:26,228
Why would you complain about the holidays being too long?

63
00:06:28,443 --> 00:06:31,434
Shu Yi, are you taking the high-speed train back too? What time is it?

64
00:06:31,515 --> 00:06:33,038
Should we go together?

65
00:06:33,782 --> 00:06:35,409
No need. It's too early.

66
00:06:35,508 --> 00:06:37,279
I'm catching a ride with a friend.

67
00:06:38,128 --> 00:06:40,780
Forget it then. Since you guys aren't celebrating,

68
00:06:40,915 --> 00:06:42,196
I'll go first.

69
00:06:42,308 --> 00:06:43,828
- Nan, I'll go with you. - Let's go.

70
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:45,482
- Bye. - Bye.

71
00:06:47,056 --> 00:06:49,082
Shu Yi. Happy Lunar New Year.

72
00:06:50,467 --> 00:06:52,122
- Bye. - Bye.

73
00:07:02,907 --> 00:07:04,747
(My home is quite close to the train station.)

74
00:07:04,863 --> 00:07:06,177
(It takes half an hour to get there.)

75
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:07,891
(You don't have to send me tomorrow.)

76
00:07:11,058 --> 00:07:12,548
(It's also quite close to your home.)

77
00:07:12,628 --> 00:07:14,108
(It takes half an hour to get there.)

78
00:08:10,733 --> 00:08:12,602
Beauty, are you buying a watch?

79
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:14,941
Are you wearing it yourself or giving it to someone?

80
00:08:14,965 --> 00:08:17,603
- Giving it to someone. - Is this for a man or a woman?

81
00:08:17,684 --> 00:08:18,895
What age range?

82
00:08:18,976 --> 00:08:20,866
For a man, around 50.

83
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,282
Okay.

84
00:08:27,428 --> 00:08:30,074
This men's watch is a classic from our brand.

85
00:08:30,168 --> 00:08:31,285
The style is simple and elegant.

86
00:08:31,309 --> 00:08:33,918
It's very suitable for a mature man around 50.

87
00:08:35,403 --> 00:08:36,882
Let's go with this one then.

88
00:08:37,098 --> 00:08:38,507
Okay. Let me wrap it up for you.

89
00:08:38,588 --> 00:08:39,803
Thank you.

90
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,051
The dial of this watch is made of sapphire.

91
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,574
Your skin is fair and your wrist is slender.

92
00:09:11,655 --> 00:09:16,389
This watch looks so delicate and nice on your wrist.

93
00:09:16,512 --> 00:09:17,667
Let's take a look.

94
00:09:17,832 --> 00:09:19,632
I'm not buying. I don't like wearing watches.

95
00:09:19,832 --> 00:09:20,867
I'm buying for Xing Zhou.

96
00:09:20,947 --> 00:09:22,340
He really likes this brand.

97
00:09:22,421 --> 00:09:24,746
(I can't believe I ran into Qin Le Zhi again.)

98
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,887
(I'm never coming back to this mall.)

99
00:09:26,981 --> 00:09:28,988
This watch really suits you.

100
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:32,357
Though it's a bit expensive, you get what you pay for.

101
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,282
All right, let's get these two.

102
00:09:39,552 --> 00:09:40,722
- Okay. - Thank you.

103
00:09:40,826 --> 00:09:42,787
For buying two watches at once,

104
00:09:42,888 --> 00:09:44,402
you can become a premium member.

105
00:09:44,487 --> 00:09:46,257
We have points to give away.

106
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:50,386
Things have changed for someone who met a rich guy.

107
00:09:50,467 --> 00:09:52,307
She's become confident to use her credit card.

108
00:09:52,867 --> 00:09:54,787
Why is everyone in the world rich,

109
00:09:54,898 --> 00:09:56,709
but I'm the poor one?

110
00:09:57,641 --> 00:09:59,962
Find a wealthy boyfriend. You can do it too.

111
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:03,506
Just that he's a bit older, and he has a wife and kids.

112
00:10:03,642 --> 00:10:05,082
It depends on whether you can accept it.

113
00:10:05,106 --> 00:10:07,742
All right. I'm aware of my own situation.

114
00:10:07,823 --> 00:10:10,223
The wealthy won't like someone like me.

115
00:10:19,194 --> 00:10:20,722
(When are you leaving tomorrow?)

116
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,562
(I got the 7am high-speed train ticket.)

117
00:10:26,355 --> 00:10:27,755
(I'll send you off.)

118
00:10:30,665 --> 00:10:32,435
Okay, I'll wait for you.

119
00:10:33,947 --> 00:10:36,002
- Here you go. It's done. - Thank you.

120
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,362
Hold it well.

121
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:42,482
- Goodbye. - Bye.

122
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,040
My boyfriend is rich. What's wrong?

123
00:10:49,169 --> 00:10:52,057
Not only is he rich, when you meet him,

124
00:10:52,138 --> 00:10:53,588
you still have to be respectful.

125
00:10:53,706 --> 00:10:55,106
You know that, right?

126
00:10:57,946 --> 00:10:59,242
You...

127
00:11:06,104 --> 00:11:07,223
Hello.

128
00:11:07,383 --> 00:11:09,194
(Le Zhi. I'm here to pick you up now.)

129
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,882
Yu You.

130
00:11:18,006 --> 00:11:19,762
Qin Shi Yue. What are you doing here?

131
00:11:19,861 --> 00:11:21,537
I'm here to say goodbye to you.

132
00:11:21,618 --> 00:11:23,227
You must be going back home.

133
00:11:24,354 --> 00:11:25,954
You came here especially to say goodbye?

134
00:11:26,548 --> 00:11:27,948
Little kitty.

135
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,770
You're so cute.

136
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,802
What's your name?

137
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,400
Shuang Shuang,

138
00:11:35,498 --> 00:11:36,948
meaning "Frosty."

139
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,810
You really have a name.

140
00:11:41,465 --> 00:11:42,865
That's a great name.

141
00:11:43,508 --> 00:11:45,922
- Come here. Shuang Shuang. Let me hug you. - Don't.

142
00:11:46,983 --> 00:11:48,383
Let me take a look.

143
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:52,978
It must hurt.

144
00:11:53,283 --> 00:11:54,683
It's okay.

145
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:58,721
These little wild cats here haven't been vaccinated against rabies.

146
00:11:58,745 --> 00:12:00,145
I'll take you to the hospital.

147
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,730
(What a good scratch.)

148
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,249
Your ex-girlfriend is really something.

149
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,196
What happened?

150
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,682
Nothing much.

151
00:12:38,171 --> 00:12:39,732
She just found a rich boyfriend

152
00:12:39,813 --> 00:12:41,402
and has been spending money like crazy.

153
00:12:41,673 --> 00:12:44,803
You misunderstood. She has nothing to do with your company's CFO.

154
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,850
Do you trust her so much?

155
00:12:51,096 --> 00:12:53,335
Or did you contact her behind my back?

156
00:12:53,993 --> 00:12:56,114
No. I'm just guessing.

157
00:13:00,665 --> 00:13:03,040
Anyway, I have already reminded her.

158
00:13:03,188 --> 00:13:05,399
If Mrs. Qiu finds out about this,

159
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,162
she'll be in deep trouble.

160
00:13:07,712 --> 00:13:09,057
If you don't like her this much,

161
00:13:09,138 --> 00:13:11,458
just tell your uncle. Wouldn't it be much easier this way?

162
00:13:12,842 --> 00:13:15,411
Why do I have to bother him with this?

163
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:19,762
Let's hurry up and eat. The food is getting cold.

164
00:13:29,985 --> 00:13:32,964
The last few vaccines must be administered on time.

165
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:35,377
- Thank you, doctor. - You're welcome. You may go home.

166
00:13:35,401 --> 00:13:36,602
Thank you.

167
00:13:40,806 --> 00:13:41,961
Yu You.

168
00:13:42,042 --> 00:13:44,122
Thank you for accompanying me to the hospital today.

169
00:13:44,687 --> 00:13:48,327
For the next few injections, do you have time to come with me?

170
00:13:49,492 --> 00:13:52,543
Sorry. I have to go back to Qing'an for the Lunar New Year.

171
00:13:54,571 --> 00:13:55,971
It's okay.

172
00:13:57,107 --> 00:13:58,722
Before the next injection,

173
00:13:58,803 --> 00:14:01,323
can you send me a message on WeChat to remind me?

174
00:14:08,101 --> 00:14:11,200
Okay. I'll remind you every time you're due for an injection.

175
00:14:11,424 --> 00:14:12,602
Okay.

176
00:14:29,195 --> 00:14:30,842
You're here so early.

177
00:14:30,962 --> 00:14:32,733
What time did you get up?

178
00:14:38,858 --> 00:14:40,042
Give it to me.

179
00:14:40,704 --> 00:14:43,362
I have a lot of stuff. It might be a bit heavy.

180
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:44,459
It's all right.

181
00:14:44,539 --> 00:14:46,281
It's cold outside. Get in the car first.

182
00:14:46,483 --> 00:14:47,682
Be obedient.

183
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:06,009
Are you not in a good mood?

184
00:15:07,917 --> 00:15:10,056
Thinking about not being able to see you for a few days,

185
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,491
I'm a bit unhappy.

186
00:15:13,217 --> 00:15:15,797
Do you have to visit every relative's house during the Lunar New Year?

187
00:15:15,821 --> 00:15:17,788
We don't have many relatives.

188
00:15:17,869 --> 00:15:20,569
I just have to visit them for the first three days.

189
00:15:22,608 --> 00:15:23,727
Got it.

190
00:15:23,808 --> 00:15:25,488
I'll try to meet you as early as possible.

191
00:15:33,147 --> 00:15:34,300
(Stop me.)

192
00:15:34,381 --> 00:15:37,341
(Tell me that you have bought the ticket to accompany me back to Qing'an.)

193
00:15:41,255 --> 00:15:44,135
(Stop me now and say that you will come to see me after Lunar New Year.)

194
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:47,314
(He must accompany his family during the Lunar New Year.)

195
00:15:47,338 --> 00:15:48,642
(Well, I'll forgive him.)

196
00:16:02,383 --> 00:16:05,258
Yi.

197
00:16:05,356 --> 00:16:07,626
You didn't have to buy me such an expensive thing.

198
00:16:07,707 --> 00:16:09,068
I have a watch already.

199
00:16:09,148 --> 00:16:10,246
You get what you pay for.

200
00:16:10,327 --> 00:16:12,689
This watch is waterproof, durable, and doesn't need a battery.

201
00:16:12,713 --> 00:16:14,846
It's suitable when you go to work or fish.

202
00:16:15,082 --> 00:16:17,402
Yi has a good taste.

203
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:18,846
Look at this.

204
00:16:18,939 --> 00:16:21,721
This earring goes well with this scarf.

205
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,922
I guess my friends are going to bother me again.

206
00:16:25,135 --> 00:16:29,057
- Why? - They will ask me where I bought it.

207
00:16:30,296 --> 00:16:31,683
Look at how you've spoiled your mom.

208
00:16:31,707 --> 00:16:32,943
She's so proud.

209
00:16:33,024 --> 00:16:34,318
Aren't you proud?

210
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,796
Who is the one buying every issue of

211
00:16:36,877 --> 00:16:38,319
the Financial Introduce magazine

212
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,440
and putting it on his work desk?

213
00:16:40,521 --> 00:16:44,010
You do that just to show off the articles written by your daughter, right?

214
00:16:44,091 --> 00:16:46,089
Yes, I do that to show off.

215
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:47,787
Is it a general article?

216
00:16:47,867 --> 00:16:49,628
It's the front-page article.

217
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:51,162
All right.

218
00:16:53,535 --> 00:16:54,802
You...

219
00:16:58,158 --> 00:16:59,483
Take a look at what time it is.

220
00:16:59,564 --> 00:17:02,088
Tomorrow, you should greet people like this.

221
00:17:08,283 --> 00:17:09,683
(Have you arrived home?)

222
00:17:14,202 --> 00:17:15,362
(Yes.)

223
00:17:15,611 --> 00:17:17,997
(I just arrived home and remembered something.)

224
00:17:18,744 --> 00:17:19,962
(What?)

225
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,842
(You.)

226
00:17:30,578 --> 00:17:34,162
(This time, Shu Yi knows she is far away from Jiangcheng.)

227
00:17:40,705 --> 00:17:42,476
Shi Yan.

228
00:17:42,657 --> 00:17:44,522
You're a sweet talker.

229
00:18:01,844 --> 00:18:03,084
(Sorry.)

230
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,802
(The user you are calling is temporarily unavailable.)

231
00:18:05,883 --> 00:18:08,202
(Please try again later. Sorry.)

232
00:18:15,183 --> 00:18:16,362
Hello.

233
00:18:17,842 --> 00:18:20,043
- Why is it you? - Where is Miss Bi?

234
00:18:20,154 --> 00:18:21,964
She took a leave to go home for the Lunar New Year.

235
00:18:21,988 --> 00:18:23,282
Thank you.

236
00:18:54,228 --> 00:18:55,442
Hey, Liang.

237
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:57,578
Help me do two things.

238
00:20:27,109 --> 00:20:29,562
- Hurry up. - I've waited for you...

239
00:20:35,992 --> 00:20:38,841
Listen. The money for the wedding planning absolutely can't be saved.

240
00:20:38,922 --> 00:20:40,163
I have to go and take a look myself.

241
00:20:40,187 --> 00:20:41,948
Okay, I'll do as you say.

242
00:20:42,028 --> 00:20:44,671
The time is too tight. But, I will definitely give it my all.

243
00:20:44,752 --> 00:20:45,863
All right.

244
00:21:04,587 --> 00:21:06,237
Excuse me. I'm taking a call.

245
00:21:10,098 --> 00:21:11,512
Hello, darling.

246
00:21:11,773 --> 00:21:14,999
(Shan Shan. I miss you so much on every festival.)

247
00:21:15,124 --> 00:21:17,671
(You heartless woman, have you been thinking of me?)

248
00:21:20,026 --> 00:21:21,586
So, what are you doing? Going shopping?

249
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,637
(Helping my cousin prepare for his wedding.)

250
00:21:24,548 --> 00:21:25,587
Oh my!

251
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:28,517
Isn't your cousin two years younger than you? He's getting married?

252
00:21:29,075 --> 00:21:31,436
(Look at him. You're falling behind.)

253
00:21:31,738 --> 00:21:34,067
You're not better than me.

254
00:21:34,717 --> 00:21:36,197
I'm different from you.

255
00:21:36,292 --> 00:21:37,822
I have a boyfriend.

256
00:21:38,023 --> 00:21:41,442
So what? Should I start preparing the red envelope?

257
00:21:41,611 --> 00:21:43,172
(I can even help you plan the wedding)

258
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:44,883
(and offer a one-stop wedding hosting service.)

259
00:21:44,907 --> 00:21:46,547
I'm not in such a hurry.

260
00:21:46,627 --> 00:21:47,746
I'm such a loyal friend.

261
00:21:47,827 --> 00:21:49,433
I have to wait until you find a boyfriend

262
00:21:49,457 --> 00:21:51,017
before I can be at ease to get married.

263
00:21:52,347 --> 00:21:53,347
(You can rest assured.)

264
00:21:53,427 --> 00:21:56,227
(After the Lunar New Year, I'll go back and help you keep an eye out.)

265
00:21:56,268 --> 00:21:58,797
Using my experience, I'll help you filter out the playboys.

266
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:00,307
(Thank you, then.)

267
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:01,810
You're welcome.

268
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:05,507
I'm hanging up now. My parents brought back the Lunar New Year's goods.

269
00:22:06,713 --> 00:22:10,440
(Bogang Yunwan)

270
00:22:14,788 --> 00:22:17,557
Yu You. You have to keep your word.

271
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,160
You said you would remind me.

272
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:20,739
Don't forget.

273
00:22:42,667 --> 00:22:44,067
(Remember to get the injection.)

274
00:22:45,228 --> 00:22:46,638
He remembers!

275
00:22:49,587 --> 00:22:51,997
(I'm afraid of the pain. I don't want to do it.)

276
00:23:02,169 --> 00:23:03,980
(Are you worried about me?)

277
00:23:05,732 --> 00:23:08,701
(But I don't want to go alone.)

278
00:23:09,733 --> 00:23:12,982
(I want you to accompany me for the next few injections.)

279
00:23:27,476 --> 00:23:29,398
Is this going too far?

280
00:23:29,602 --> 00:23:31,132
He has stopped replying to me.

281
00:23:40,105 --> 00:23:43,274
(Fine. You go get that shot first today.)

282
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:46,709
(Yes, sir!)

283
00:24:09,053 --> 00:24:10,202
Shan Shan.

284
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:11,762
Guan Ji.

285
00:24:13,337 --> 00:24:14,576
How did you come here? You...

286
00:24:14,657 --> 00:24:16,428
How did you know I live here?

287
00:24:17,236 --> 00:24:18,876
You didn't answer my calls

288
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,517
and didn't reply to my WeChat messages.

289
00:24:21,228 --> 00:24:22,717
So, I had to come here to find you.

290
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,519
I've been a bit busy these days.

291
00:24:27,602 --> 00:24:29,002
Busy with what?

292
00:24:34,468 --> 00:24:36,237
You promised me

293
00:24:36,788 --> 00:24:38,628
that you wouldn't hide from me anymore, right?

294
00:24:40,387 --> 00:24:42,398
Even in a competition, there's halftime.

295
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:45,588
It's the Lunar New Year. I want to have a peaceful Lunar New Year.

296
00:24:45,673 --> 00:24:48,523
It's late. You should go back to the hotel and rest.

297
00:24:51,689 --> 00:24:53,460
Tomorrow is Lunar New Year's Eve.

298
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,267
You should go back early.

299
00:24:56,748 --> 00:24:58,067
Bi Ruo Shan.

300
00:24:58,147 --> 00:24:59,347
I like you.

301
00:24:59,544 --> 00:25:01,154
Can't you feel it?

302
00:25:09,468 --> 00:25:10,878
We meet every week

303
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:12,668
and give each other joy.

304
00:25:12,813 --> 00:25:14,388
We are devoted to each other

305
00:25:14,498 --> 00:25:16,348
and don't cause each other trouble.

306
00:25:16,716 --> 00:25:19,086
That being said, I also like you a lot.

307
00:25:20,653 --> 00:25:22,578
I'm not talking about this kind of liking. It's...

308
00:25:22,602 --> 00:25:23,802
What kind is it?

309
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:26,053
Even a common toy,

310
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,603
if you play with it for a long time, you will develop feelings for it,

311
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:31,517
let alone a toy whose mystery hasn't been solved yet.

312
00:25:32,788 --> 00:25:34,587
I didn't reply right away,

313
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:35,988
and you couldn't take it.

314
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:37,188
In the end,

315
00:25:37,268 --> 00:25:41,628
your liking is nothing but a desire to conquer and possess.

316
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:45,267
You just can't accept the fact that you can't control certain people.

317
00:25:45,354 --> 00:25:46,684
So,

318
00:25:47,028 --> 00:25:49,158
you came here and told me you like me.

319
00:25:49,867 --> 00:25:51,267
And then what?

320
00:25:55,907 --> 00:25:57,042
No.

321
00:25:58,627 --> 00:26:00,027
There can't be

322
00:26:01,921 --> 00:26:04,051
any result between us.

323
00:26:06,213 --> 00:26:07,972
So, I'm begging you, Mr. Guan,

324
00:26:08,084 --> 00:26:09,484
let me go.

325
00:26:10,228 --> 00:26:12,517
We met, and it ends here.

326
00:26:13,237 --> 00:26:14,397
From now on,

327
00:26:14,547 --> 00:26:17,398
we won't bother and are at peace with each other.

328
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,290
(Happy Lunar New Year)

329
00:27:13,209 --> 00:27:15,728
You are on your phone all day long.

330
00:27:15,874 --> 00:27:17,925
It seems that you're trying to get into the phone.

331
00:27:19,122 --> 00:27:21,732
I'm sending Lunar New Year's greetings to my boss.

332
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,130
That's thoughtful of you.

333
00:27:24,347 --> 00:27:26,428
Did you send greetings to Yu You?

334
00:27:26,508 --> 00:27:27,722
I did.

335
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:30,035
I wish him a prosperous Lunar New Year, abundant wealth,

336
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:31,747
smooth work, and good health.

337
00:27:31,827 --> 00:27:33,347
How's that? Is that sincere enough?

338
00:27:33,442 --> 00:27:35,012
I typed it out word by word.

339
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:36,908
Why not just invite him out for a meal

340
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,388
and wish him face-to-face?

341
00:27:38,468 --> 00:27:40,358
I think that would be more sincere.

342
00:27:44,268 --> 00:27:47,108
- What are you doing? It's time for dinner. - Got it.

343
00:27:53,028 --> 00:27:54,908
- Hello? - (What are you doing?)

344
00:27:55,026 --> 00:27:56,506
Have you had your reunion dinner yet?

345
00:27:56,548 --> 00:27:58,358
(Not yet. How about you?)

346
00:27:58,827 --> 00:28:00,227
I haven't either.

347
00:28:02,067 --> 00:28:04,962
Are there stars in the sky in Jiangcheng tonight?

348
00:28:06,616 --> 00:28:09,825
I was trying to say...

349
00:28:10,508 --> 00:28:12,319
Yes, there are many.

350
00:28:12,667 --> 00:28:13,962
I miss you.

351
00:28:14,116 --> 00:28:15,516
Zheng Shu Yi.

352
00:28:17,187 --> 00:28:19,678
I miss you too. I want to see you.

353
00:28:22,107 --> 00:28:23,507
There are just a few days left.

354
00:28:23,588 --> 00:28:24,922
Who said that?

355
00:28:25,028 --> 00:28:26,148
There are still a few days.

356
00:28:26,228 --> 00:28:28,438
Yi. Come out for dinner.

357
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:29,948
Coming!

358
00:28:30,068 --> 00:28:31,557
My mom asked me to have dinner.

359
00:28:32,867 --> 00:28:34,402
All right. Eat more.

360
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:36,547
(You should eat more too.)

361
00:28:39,308 --> 00:28:40,482
Help me out.

362
00:28:45,468 --> 00:28:46,708
We haven't had dinner yet.

363
00:28:46,819 --> 00:28:48,949
How come I feel you're full already?

364
00:28:53,715 --> 00:28:54,915
Yu You is busy.

365
00:28:55,028 --> 00:28:56,722
He only got home today.

366
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,802
Young people nowadays work really hard.

367
00:29:00,028 --> 00:29:02,202
So, just let him rest for a couple of days

368
00:29:02,347 --> 00:29:03,908
and then invite him and Yi

369
00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:05,709
to have dinner together.

370
00:29:06,802 --> 00:29:09,136
- I'm not going. - Why not?

371
00:29:10,573 --> 00:29:12,002
I'm not going.

372
00:29:12,068 --> 00:29:14,628
Don't match-make us. I don't have any feelings for him.

373
00:29:14,723 --> 00:29:15,762
And,

374
00:29:18,708 --> 00:29:20,827
I have plans for my relationship.

375
00:29:22,004 --> 00:29:23,404
You keep saying that,

376
00:29:23,667 --> 00:29:26,277
but I haven't seen your plan come to fruition.

377
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:29,190
Later, I'll invite him over to give you a fright.

378
00:29:29,355 --> 00:29:31,643
Hey, don't say something unlucky during the Lunar New Year.

379
00:29:31,667 --> 00:29:33,842
Kids are like that. Don't mind it.

380
00:29:35,867 --> 00:29:38,202
Mom, you have really amazing cooking skills.

381
00:29:38,283 --> 00:29:39,933
The dishes are made by your dad.

382
00:29:40,907 --> 00:29:43,158
You've flattered the wrong person.

383
00:29:43,284 --> 00:29:44,645
Who is it...

384
00:29:44,788 --> 00:29:46,388
All right. Come on.

385
00:29:46,468 --> 00:29:48,037
Happy Lunar New Year.

386
00:29:49,332 --> 00:29:50,982
Happy Lunar New Year.

387
00:29:51,528 --> 00:29:53,619
- Happy Lunar New Year. - Dad. Happy Lunar New Year.

388
00:29:53,643 --> 00:29:55,064
Dad. Wishing you great health.

389
00:29:55,147 --> 00:29:56,547
All right. Come on.

390
00:29:59,817 --> 00:30:01,155
Hurry up and eat, everyone. It's been a while

391
00:30:01,179 --> 00:30:03,655
since we last tasted my brother-in-law's Michelin-level dishes.

392
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,408
Is it Michelin-level?

393
00:30:05,619 --> 00:30:07,870
- Try it. - You'll know after you try it.

394
00:30:08,964 --> 00:30:10,973
But, this is a rare occasion.

395
00:30:11,122 --> 00:30:14,682
Wen Guang. It's not easy for your family to be together.

396
00:30:18,668 --> 00:30:20,157
They're busy

397
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,162
so I can be free.

398
00:30:24,848 --> 00:30:26,535
Xiao Ming. I haven't seen you since New Year's Day.

399
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:27,949
Take a few days off for the Lunar New Year.

400
00:30:27,973 --> 00:30:29,708
You, Shi Yan, and Guan Ji can

401
00:30:29,788 --> 00:30:31,188
go to my ranch to ride horses.

402
00:30:31,708 --> 00:30:34,348
Also, you two can go to my wine cellar

403
00:30:34,428 --> 00:30:35,838
to taste the new wine I just got.

404
00:30:36,228 --> 00:30:37,628
It's better than this.

405
00:30:38,554 --> 00:30:39,954
You're bragging.

406
00:30:40,068 --> 00:30:42,307
I really want to go but in two days,

407
00:30:42,394 --> 00:30:43,925
I have to go abroad for a project.

408
00:30:44,508 --> 00:30:47,587
Speaking of the ranch, how is my horse Ai Lan recently?

409
00:30:47,667 --> 00:30:49,099
Brother-in-law, you haven't been there for so long.

410
00:30:49,123 --> 00:30:50,949
Ai Lan has been taken over by Yue.

411
00:30:52,788 --> 00:30:56,987
Ai Lan was a gift from Dad to Mom. Since it's Mom's, it's mine.

412
00:30:57,627 --> 00:30:59,987
Your logic is a bit wrong.

413
00:31:00,187 --> 00:31:03,642
Mine can be yours, but your mom's things belong to her only.

414
00:31:03,867 --> 00:31:06,717
The thing is, both my and your things belong to her.

415
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:10,711
- Yes, Dad is right. - Great attitude.

416
00:31:10,876 --> 00:31:12,737
Come on. Let's toast. Wishing everyone a happy Lunar New Year.

417
00:31:12,761 --> 00:31:15,691
Happy Lunar New Year.

418
00:31:15,888 --> 00:31:17,849
Mom and Dad. Let's take a picture.

419
00:31:17,947 --> 00:31:19,827
- All right. - Come on. Let's take a picture.

420
00:31:20,964 --> 00:31:22,308
- Let's raise our cups. - Come on.

421
00:31:22,332 --> 00:31:23,435
Mom and Dad. Cheers.

422
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,787
- Happy Lunar New Year. - Happy Lunar New Year.

423
00:31:25,924 --> 00:31:28,532
- Dumplings are here. - Brother-in-law.

424
00:31:28,613 --> 00:31:31,267
- Let's have some dumplings first. - Come on. Have a drink.

425
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:32,747
Sister and Dad. Have a drink.

426
00:31:33,797 --> 00:31:36,107
- Come on. - Let's have the dumplings.

427
00:31:36,218 --> 00:31:37,618
Let's have the dumplings.

428
00:31:59,932 --> 00:32:01,082
Here.

429
00:32:14,844 --> 00:32:16,672
You're not watching the Spring Festival Gala anymore?

430
00:32:16,696 --> 00:32:18,697
Not watching. I want to watch the stars.

431
00:32:21,827 --> 00:32:23,638
Going to the room to watch the stars?

432
00:32:24,508 --> 00:32:25,908
What stars is she watching?

433
00:32:26,003 --> 00:32:27,762
It's obviously a phone call.

434
00:32:27,996 --> 00:32:30,326
Why does she have so many calls every day?

435
00:32:33,107 --> 00:32:35,627
It's Lunar New Year's Eve, and she's having a video call with someone.

436
00:32:35,651 --> 00:32:37,501
Is something really happening?

437
00:32:40,087 --> 00:32:41,507
Let's go take a look.

438
00:32:42,268 --> 00:32:44,428
- Let's go. - I'm attending a wedding

439
00:32:44,669 --> 00:32:45,909
in two days.

440
00:32:46,013 --> 00:32:47,693
My senior from college is getting married.

441
00:32:47,877 --> 00:32:49,024
Are you close to him?

442
00:32:49,107 --> 00:32:51,278
(Yeah. We used to play together in college.)

443
00:32:52,684 --> 00:32:54,894
Do you usually call him "Senior?"

444
00:32:55,387 --> 00:32:56,878
Yeah. I call him "Senior."

445
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,890
So what? When you were in college, did no one call you "Senior?"

446
00:33:05,571 --> 00:33:07,091
Listen to your daughter,

447
00:33:07,187 --> 00:33:10,602
the way she talks when she video calls people. Why is she so pretentious?

448
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:12,250
Right.

449
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:14,188
Something must be happening.

450
00:33:14,268 --> 00:33:15,362
Right.

451
00:33:16,907 --> 00:33:18,797
Just knowing this is enough.

452
00:33:18,946 --> 00:33:20,162
Let's go.

453
00:33:21,788 --> 00:33:23,587
I don't have any plans.

454
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:25,682
I'm just here to accompany my dad and sister.

455
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:27,869
(What about your niece?)

456
00:33:28,021 --> 00:33:29,710
She's always busy and can't stay still.

457
00:33:32,268 --> 00:33:33,668
(What's wrong?)

458
00:33:34,268 --> 00:33:35,546
Nothing.

459
00:33:36,436 --> 00:33:37,642
Shu Yi...

460
00:33:39,454 --> 00:33:40,602
Forget it.

461
00:33:42,051 --> 00:33:43,451
What do you want to say?

462
00:33:45,387 --> 00:33:47,282
Come back earlier, okay?

463
00:33:50,948 --> 00:33:52,082
(Okay.)

464
00:33:52,611 --> 00:33:54,011
I'll wait for you.

465
00:33:56,555 --> 00:33:57,955
I'm going in.

466
00:33:58,268 --> 00:34:00,482
Then, wait until they all fall asleep.

467
00:34:00,563 --> 00:34:03,128
If you haven't gone to sleep yet, I'll give you a private call.

468
00:34:03,587 --> 00:34:05,517
I don't sleep that early.

469
00:34:07,387 --> 00:34:08,710
(Got it.)

470
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,191
Why haven't you hung up yet?

471
00:34:17,068 --> 00:34:18,628
(I'm waiting for you to hang up first.)

472
00:34:19,667 --> 00:34:20,868
Okay. I'll hang up first.

473
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,402
- Happy Lunar New Year. - Happy Lunar New Year.

474
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:32,235
About the wedding,

475
00:34:33,332 --> 00:34:35,002
it's impossible not to go.

476
00:34:35,636 --> 00:34:37,036
Since I have to go,

477
00:34:37,213 --> 00:34:41,242
I must be more dazzling than Qin Le Zhi.

478
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,163
So cute.

479
00:34:44,261 --> 00:34:46,042
The kids' happy vibes are infectious.

480
00:34:46,123 --> 00:34:47,523
So nice.

481
00:34:49,563 --> 00:34:50,683
Uncle.

482
00:34:50,787 --> 00:34:52,587
Who were you calling just now?

483
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:53,842
A friend.

484
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,526
Not inside, but outside.

485
00:34:58,635 --> 00:35:00,468
And, it's even a video call.

486
00:35:00,585 --> 00:35:02,162
You talked for more than 10 minutes,

487
00:35:02,243 --> 00:35:03,900
so it wasn't for Lunar New Year's greetings.

488
00:35:03,924 --> 00:35:05,890
You came back with a lingering look.

489
00:35:05,995 --> 00:35:07,604
So, it wasn't about work.

490
00:35:07,703 --> 00:35:09,987
So, it was a girl...

491
00:35:10,068 --> 00:35:11,468
My girlfriend.

492
00:35:13,267 --> 00:35:14,766
Really?

493
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,562
You admit it so easily.

494
00:35:16,766 --> 00:35:17,940
Your younger brother

495
00:35:18,028 --> 00:35:20,908
was always someone who dared to do anything.

496
00:35:22,252 --> 00:35:23,652
I know who it is.

497
00:35:24,421 --> 00:35:25,821
Who is it?

498
00:35:27,999 --> 00:35:30,682
We should let Shi Yan tell you himself, right?

499
00:35:32,806 --> 00:35:34,808
I'll ask her if she's willing to make it public.

500
00:35:34,931 --> 00:35:37,650
No, I can't wait. Why don't you tell us now?

501
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:39,016
Yeah, Shi Yan.

502
00:35:39,139 --> 00:35:41,514
At this point in time, are you still trying to beat around the bush?

503
00:35:41,538 --> 00:35:42,938
Call and ask her now.

504
00:35:43,796 --> 00:35:46,618
I have to ask her in person to show my sincerity.

505
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,771
Ask him in person to show my sincerity?

506
00:36:14,545 --> 00:36:15,929
Let's have a round.

507
00:36:16,461 --> 00:36:17,602
Okay.

508
00:36:25,388 --> 00:36:27,157
How come there's one piece less?

509
00:36:28,861 --> 00:36:30,261
One piece less?

510
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,009
Are you saying you're missing a piece of your heart?

511
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,811
Looks like I really have to look for one.

512
00:36:41,548 --> 00:36:43,117
Where have I put it?

513
00:36:44,033 --> 00:36:45,433
You...

514
00:36:52,969 --> 00:36:54,202
Found it.

515
00:36:54,988 --> 00:36:56,388
I have the piece now.

516
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,772
Your mom is just concerned about you.

517
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,509
She's not rushing you to get married.

518
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:18,645
The key is she doesn't want you to miss someone you like.

519
00:37:20,828 --> 00:37:22,228
I know.

520
00:37:26,348 --> 00:37:27,918
You don't play by the book.

521
00:37:28,981 --> 00:37:30,602
Let's do it again.

522
00:37:30,988 --> 00:37:32,637
How can I nullify this step of yours?

523
00:37:36,479 --> 00:37:38,369
Iron bolt checkmate.

524
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:42,201
Rest early.

525
00:37:42,452 --> 00:37:44,642
- Dad, you should rest early too. - Okay.

526
00:37:47,293 --> 00:37:49,143
Old ginger is truly spicier.

527
00:38:04,781 --> 00:38:06,010
(Even when we were playing chess, )

528
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:08,274
(my parents had the opportunity to hint at my marriage.)

529
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,811
(So did my parents.)

530
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,891
(Which one looks better?)

531
00:38:30,179 --> 00:38:32,179
(Which one to wear when meeting important people?)

532
00:38:35,374 --> 00:38:36,639
This is funny.

533
00:38:37,724 --> 00:38:39,657
Dad and Uncle Guan. Happy Lunar New Year.

534
00:38:39,738 --> 00:38:41,658
Sister and Brother-in-law. Happy Lunar New Year.

535
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:44,350
I have something to do. I have to go and take care of it.

536
00:38:44,904 --> 00:38:46,100
So early?

537
00:38:47,129 --> 00:38:48,649
Take a break, it's the Lunar New Year.

538
00:38:48,776 --> 00:38:50,176
Just take care of it in two days.

539
00:38:51,083 --> 00:38:53,413
I won't be available in two days.

540
00:38:54,388 --> 00:38:56,075
Hurry up and get busy.

541
00:38:56,274 --> 00:38:58,402
Enjoy. I'll give you a red envelope later.

542
00:38:59,667 --> 00:39:01,077
Something's up with this kid.

543
00:39:01,158 --> 00:39:02,399
Hey.

544
00:39:02,672 --> 00:39:04,072
Where are you going?

545
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:07,599
I have to prepare something too.

546
00:39:08,652 --> 00:39:10,583
Your mom isn't even going to the gala this year.

547
00:39:10,672 --> 00:39:13,002
- Aren't you going to accompany her? - Yeah.

548
00:39:17,468 --> 00:39:19,402
I'm fine. Just go.

549
00:39:19,965 --> 00:39:22,040
Thanks, Mom. Mom, you're the best.

550
00:39:22,215 --> 00:39:23,958
Grandpas, Dad, Mom, and Guan Ji.

551
00:39:24,059 --> 00:39:25,300
I'm going up first.

552
00:39:25,436 --> 00:39:26,676
Happy Lunar New Year, everyone.

553
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,278
Happy Lunar New Year.

554
00:39:34,633 --> 00:39:36,968
Something's up with these two people.

555
00:39:37,746 --> 00:39:39,746
I wish you have the same problem.

556
00:39:43,828 --> 00:39:45,002
Maybe

557
00:39:45,828 --> 00:39:47,388
I can have something wrong with me too.

558
00:39:49,172 --> 00:39:50,572
What is that?

559
00:39:53,328 --> 00:39:54,487
Nothing.

560
00:39:54,595 --> 00:39:56,125
Something's up with you too?

561
00:39:57,391 --> 00:39:59,059
Are you trying to hide it from me?

562
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:00,482
Say it out.

563
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:01,711
Say it.

564
00:40:01,853 --> 00:40:02,962
Don't worry.

565
00:40:03,394 --> 00:40:04,794
Nothing is happening.

566
00:40:15,908 --> 00:40:17,308
Come and chase me.

567
00:40:19,146 --> 00:40:21,802
Baby. Look here. Isn't it beautiful?

568
00:40:21,911 --> 00:40:23,511
Come to Mommy.

569
00:40:23,661 --> 00:40:25,061
Run slowly.

570
00:40:53,786 --> 00:40:55,746
Why have you been making up for such a long time?

571
00:40:55,809 --> 00:40:57,619
You're not even the bride.

572
00:40:58,130 --> 00:40:59,659
Stop minding my business.

573
00:41:07,415 --> 00:41:10,387
(Since I have to attend the wedding alone today, )

574
00:41:10,523 --> 00:41:13,253
(I must show that I'm as pretty as two persons combined.)

575
00:41:27,481 --> 00:41:29,202
Shu Yi, you're here.

576
00:41:29,369 --> 00:41:32,089
Congratulations on your wedding, Senior. You look so handsome today.

577
00:41:32,931 --> 00:41:34,162
Thank you.

578
00:41:34,684 --> 00:41:37,123
I'm really sorry. It's my fault for not considering it thoroughly.

579
00:41:37,147 --> 00:41:38,851
Why are you saying this on such a joyous day?

580
00:41:38,875 --> 00:41:41,602
He's the one who wronged me, not you. I'm fine.

581
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:45,145
Oh, by the way, I've arranged for you to sit at the relatives' table,

582
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,569
so you won't run into him.

583
00:41:46,787 --> 00:41:47,828
Thank you.

584
00:41:47,908 --> 00:41:49,042
Qian Qian.

585
00:41:51,277 --> 00:41:53,669
Take Shu Yi to sit on your side. Take good care of her.

586
00:41:53,785 --> 00:41:55,944
Okay. Shu Yi. Come with me.

587
00:42:01,468 --> 00:42:02,642
Shu Yi.

588
00:42:05,284 --> 00:42:06,777
Shu Yi. You're here.

589
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:08,980
Are you still working in Financial Introduce?

590
00:42:09,989 --> 00:42:12,349
Shu Yi. I heard you interviewed Shi Yan.

591
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:13,840
How was it? Was he handsome?

592
00:42:15,428 --> 00:42:17,918
Really? Your job is so great.

593
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:22,878
Shu Yi. Let's go sit over there.

594
00:42:25,868 --> 00:42:27,067
Yeah. We're all over there.

595
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,543
- Let's go together. - Yeah. Come on.

596
00:42:28,567 --> 00:42:29,802
Let's go.

597
00:42:31,502 --> 00:42:32,902
We should all blame him.

598
00:42:33,333 --> 00:42:34,413
Shu Yi. You're here.

599
00:42:34,548 --> 00:42:35,948
Hurry up and sit down.

600
00:42:37,468 --> 00:42:39,130
I remember your boyfriend is from our college's

601
00:42:39,154 --> 00:42:40,554
Computer Science department, right?

602
00:42:40,968 --> 00:42:42,687
He and Chen Yue Ding are good friends.

603
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:44,498
Why didn't he come along?

604
00:42:44,797 --> 00:42:45,917
We broke up.

605
00:42:46,028 --> 00:42:47,428
I don't know if he'll come.

606
00:42:48,548 --> 00:42:49,948
Broke...

607
00:42:51,707 --> 00:42:53,637
I thought you wouldn't come.

608
00:42:54,348 --> 00:42:55,667
It's not my fault.

609
00:42:55,762 --> 00:42:57,162
Why wouldn't I come?

610
00:42:58,187 --> 00:43:00,077
You should have brought your boyfriend.

611
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,335
You have one, right?
