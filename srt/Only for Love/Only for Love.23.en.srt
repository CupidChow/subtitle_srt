1
00:01:31,082 --> 00:01:36,082
(Only for Love)

2
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:39,042
(Episode 23)

3
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,120
Go back and sleep.

4
00:01:47,936 --> 00:01:49,295
Are you really not going to do it again?

5
00:01:49,413 --> 00:01:51,904
I didn't feel anything just now.

6
00:01:54,945 --> 00:01:57,595
Hurry up and go to sleep. Good night.

7
00:02:14,872 --> 00:02:16,272
Uncle.

8
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,200
What are you doing here?

9
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,770
I'm here to work.

10
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:26,922
Work?

11
00:02:27,406 --> 00:02:30,006
Yeah. So, don't we have a chip conference?

12
00:02:30,092 --> 00:02:33,490
It's such an important industry forum. I'm sure I have to come and learn.

13
00:02:35,518 --> 00:02:36,519
Learn?

14
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,042
Aren't all the spots for the magazine filled already?

15
00:02:40,524 --> 00:02:42,574
I asked Guan Ji to bring me here.

16
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:46,440
All right, since you're here, learn well.

17
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:51,922
That's it?

18
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:53,918
Is it this easy?

19
00:02:54,377 --> 00:02:56,642
Has Uncle changed his attitude?

20
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,050
(Feels like he's become passive.)

21
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,879
(My niece is here.)

22
00:03:19,963 --> 00:03:21,522
(Weren't you interested in her?)

23
00:03:21,603 --> 00:03:23,003
(Do you want to meet her?)

24
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,400
Qin Le Zhi?

25
00:03:27,856 --> 00:03:29,496
(I'm not ready yet.)

26
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,240
(I'm here for work this time.)

27
00:03:31,321 --> 00:03:32,721
(Next time.)

28
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,249
(I'm here. Room 2410, Star Hotel.)

29
00:04:22,275 --> 00:04:24,115
(Yi)

30
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,723
Weren't you saying you don't like to go on assignments?

31
00:04:29,804 --> 00:04:31,204
How come you're here?

32
00:04:35,119 --> 00:04:38,021
I think I'm influenced by the hardworking Miss Zheng?

33
00:04:38,138 --> 00:04:39,802
I'm full of ambition now too.

34
00:04:39,893 --> 00:04:42,024
I'm planning to climb the peak of success.

35
00:04:42,693 --> 00:04:45,943
This chip conference is an important reporting opportunity.

36
00:04:46,024 --> 00:04:47,673
I obviously can't miss it.

37
00:04:48,238 --> 00:04:49,767
You've got the right attitude.

38
00:04:51,673 --> 00:04:53,402
Oh, right. Do you know that.

39
00:04:53,503 --> 00:04:55,669
Qin Le Zhi also stays at this hotel?

40
00:04:55,763 --> 00:04:57,414
What if I run into her?

41
00:04:59,912 --> 00:05:03,879
The hotel has so many floors. It's not that easy to run into her, right?

42
00:05:04,005 --> 00:05:05,879
Besides, aren't you here to work?

43
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,450
She probably won't go to the chip conference, right?

44
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,530
(Guan Ji, come out and play.)

45
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,162
I'm on business. Let's do it next time.

46
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,042
(Bi Ruo Shan.)

47
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,809
(What should I do so that you won't blow hot and cold with me?)

48
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,358
It's an honor to meet you, Mr. Shi.

49
00:06:22,637 --> 00:06:24,957
I'm not very good at speaking the things they say.

50
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:26,438
But if there's a chance,

51
00:06:26,581 --> 00:06:27,981
I hope I can talk business

52
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,560
or collaborate with you.

53
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:32,236
If there's a chance, definitely.

54
00:06:37,716 --> 00:06:39,116
I'm leaving first.

55
00:07:04,576 --> 00:07:05,724
(I'm done here.)

56
00:07:05,805 --> 00:07:07,205
(I'm on the way back.)

57
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,610
What if he talks to me again about Qin Le Zhi?

58
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:15,839
I shouldn't meet him.

59
00:07:15,974 --> 00:07:18,622
(I'm going to sleep.)

60
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:21,557
(It's so late. You should go back and get some sleep too.)

61
00:07:21,781 --> 00:07:22,982
(Good night.)

62
00:07:27,437 --> 00:07:29,557
Zheng Shu Yi.

63
00:07:29,638 --> 00:07:33,280
You dug a hole for yourself and buried yourself in it.

64
00:07:43,289 --> 00:07:44,368
Don't you want a drink?

65
00:07:44,453 --> 00:07:45,611
No.

66
00:07:46,353 --> 00:07:47,804
He must have had a lot today.

67
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,520
I bet he gets a headache just hearing the word "drink".

68
00:07:52,837 --> 00:07:54,722
I ran into Yi Yang at an event today.

69
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,199
Hold on.

70
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,680
It's time to rest now.

71
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,560
Hearing all this triggers my headache as well.

72
00:08:01,865 --> 00:08:04,299
Yi Yang is really young. He's also very determined.

73
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,780
He's really a dark horse.

74
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:21,467
What's wrong, Mr. Shi?

75
00:08:21,925 --> 00:08:23,765
Why are you so affectionate with your phone today?

76
00:08:23,846 --> 00:08:25,302
Which beauty are you sending messages to?

77
00:08:32,591 --> 00:08:33,842
My girlfriend.

78
00:08:35,247 --> 00:08:36,956
Come on. Tell us.

79
00:08:37,037 --> 00:08:40,090
Which brave woman has accepted you, such a pain in the neck?

80
00:08:42,903 --> 00:08:45,313
Wait until she wants to make it public. Then, I'll tell you guys.

81
00:08:47,149 --> 00:08:49,109
I understand you can't talk about her identity.

82
00:08:49,232 --> 00:08:51,599
But, at least tell us how you saw each other.

83
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:54,409
Yeah, tell us your love story, Mr. Shi.

84
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,308
Maybe it was a wrong crush at first,

85
00:08:57,389 --> 00:08:58,789
but things turned right.

86
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,559
Wrong crush?

87
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:03,332
So, who was crushing on whom?

88
00:09:03,413 --> 00:09:05,142
Is it a good crush or not?

89
00:09:06,082 --> 00:09:07,493
She was crushing on me.

90
00:09:07,846 --> 00:09:09,376
Even if it was a wrong crush, you wanted her?

91
00:09:12,221 --> 00:09:15,610
She must have eventually really fallen for me.

92
00:09:17,806 --> 00:09:19,536
You talk about it so casually.

93
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,581
We are really envious.

94
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,682
Don't just talk about me.

95
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,282
You two must have much more interesting love stories than me.

96
00:09:31,693 --> 00:09:34,135
If you're talking about Guan Ji, he really has interesting love stories.

97
00:09:34,216 --> 00:09:36,719
I'm single, so there's nothing much to talk about.

98
00:09:36,872 --> 00:09:38,079
Is that so?

99
00:09:38,326 --> 00:09:41,679
Is there no one pursuing our gentle and knowledgeable Professor Yu?

100
00:09:44,659 --> 00:09:46,068
The one I think is suitable for me

101
00:09:46,846 --> 00:09:48,576
isn't interested in me.

102
00:09:49,026 --> 00:09:51,522
The one interested in me is not really suitable for me.

103
00:09:51,776 --> 00:09:53,040
But recently, I've been thinking

104
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,720
that relationship should be a two-way thing.

105
00:09:55,885 --> 00:09:58,814
So, it shouldn't be solved like a math problem.

106
00:10:01,516 --> 00:10:03,486
Relationships should be two-way.

107
00:10:04,572 --> 00:10:06,190
Why are you so gossipy?

108
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:08,883
Why didn't I see you being so concerned about others' love lives before?

109
00:10:13,823 --> 00:10:15,109
Why are you looking at me?

110
00:10:15,211 --> 00:10:17,240
I don't have any moving love story.

111
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,880
This isn't like you. So insecure.

112
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:22,402
Come on. Tell us. Who discouraged you?

113
00:10:23,245 --> 00:10:24,528
No one.

114
00:10:24,819 --> 00:10:26,219
Come on. Let's drink.

115
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:33,520
(Love is a tormenting thing)

116
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:38,169
(Yet, it's hard to give up like this)

117
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,282
(Love is my only secret)

118
00:10:43,453 --> 00:10:48,249
(It breaks my heart yet I'm still captivated)

119
00:10:48,806 --> 00:10:50,495
You better send him back.

120
00:10:51,577 --> 00:10:53,362
- Bye.   - Bye.

121
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:59,552
(Love is the secret in my heart)

122
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,970
(It breaks...)

123
00:11:04,691 --> 00:11:07,901
It breaks my heart yet I'm still captivated.

124
00:11:22,284 --> 00:11:24,453
(Good morning, Miss Zheng. It's 8 o'clock now.)

125
00:11:24,534 --> 00:11:25,993
(We're here to wake you up.)

126
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:27,889
I'm awake. Thank you.

127
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,160
I didn't sleep well last night.

128
00:11:41,438 --> 00:11:43,727
His niece is really troublesome.

129
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:48,608
Have you had breakfast?

130
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,362
Yes, I have. What about you?

131
00:11:50,516 --> 00:11:51,642
Let's go.

132
00:11:57,806 --> 00:12:00,111
(Just stay steady like this. We won't bump into her.)

133
00:12:00,244 --> 00:12:02,488
(I can do it. I'm the one in charge.)

134
00:12:03,917 --> 00:12:06,120
Oh, right. Why did your niece come here?

135
00:12:06,246 --> 00:12:07,882
Is she here for a trip?

136
00:12:08,104 --> 00:12:10,559
She said she was here to attend the chip conference and learn.

137
00:12:15,147 --> 00:12:16,962
Why did you suddenly think of asking about her?

138
00:12:17,229 --> 00:12:19,199
I'm just concerned about your family.

139
00:12:35,567 --> 00:12:37,647
(Qin Le Zhi is going to the chip conference.)

140
00:12:37,815 --> 00:12:39,070
(If we run into her, )

141
00:12:39,151 --> 00:12:40,959
(and Shi Yan finds out about my relationship with her, )

142
00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:42,963
(Shi Yan will definitely think that I approached him at first)

143
00:12:43,044 --> 00:12:44,762
(to get revenge on Qin Le Zhi.)

144
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,559
(How can I explain that?)

145
00:12:46,747 --> 00:12:48,637
(It can't be explained at all, right?)

146
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,760
What's wrong?

147
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,082
Nothing.

148
00:12:55,163 --> 00:12:57,131
Maybe I changed my environment last night.

149
00:12:57,212 --> 00:12:58,612
So, I didn't sleep well.

150
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,320
Get some rest then.

151
00:13:24,973 --> 00:13:26,682
(I heard you went to Fucheng.)

152
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,042
(Didn't you say you were with your dad?)

153
00:13:30,669 --> 00:13:33,720
(Oh, snap. Bluetooth connected automatically.)

154
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,640
Your dad?

155
00:13:41,469 --> 00:13:43,880
Is it embarrassing for you to go out with me?

156
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:46,281
No.

157
00:13:49,014 --> 00:13:50,442
Got it.

158
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,009
Can we get off here?

159
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:05,460
Someone wants to get off.

160
00:14:19,837 --> 00:14:21,327
Go ahead first.

161
00:14:22,245 --> 00:14:23,644
You're not coming with me?

162
00:14:23,852 --> 00:14:25,160
(I wanted to.)

163
00:14:25,321 --> 00:14:27,258
(But, what if we run into Qin Le Zhi?)

164
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,962
My friend is here.

165
00:14:29,059 --> 00:14:30,962
I'm going to say hi to her.

166
00:14:31,431 --> 00:14:32,831
We'll meet in the report hall then.

167
00:14:50,094 --> 00:14:53,042
It's almost starting. I haven't seen Qin Le Zhi yet.

168
00:14:53,124 --> 00:14:54,524
I guess she's not coming.

169
00:14:59,852 --> 00:15:01,520
- Yue?   - Shu Yi.

170
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,249
Weren't you supposed to run some errands with your dad?

171
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,880
I'm done with that.

172
00:15:07,016 --> 00:15:08,354
I have a friend coming.

173
00:15:08,435 --> 00:15:10,165
So, I came to learn something too.

174
00:15:10,764 --> 00:15:12,164
Why are you here?

175
00:15:12,891 --> 00:15:14,959
I have the exact same intention as you, Shu Yi.

176
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,691
I'm here to learn too.

177
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:22,241
Shu Yi. What expression is this?

178
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:24,412
Don't you want me to come?

179
00:15:25,739 --> 00:15:26,935
(Yue is here.)

180
00:15:27,036 --> 00:15:28,486
(If we run into Qin Le Zhi later, )

181
00:15:28,567 --> 00:15:30,842
(we'll have an advantage with two against one.)

182
00:15:30,923 --> 00:15:32,346
(Even if Shi Yan joins the scene, )

183
00:15:32,427 --> 00:15:34,362
(we'll still be at a draw.)

184
00:15:34,505 --> 00:15:36,434
I really want you to come.

185
00:15:36,826 --> 00:15:39,196
After you come back, write a report to me.

186
00:15:41,533 --> 00:15:44,307
At this chip conference, many semiconductor companies are present.

187
00:15:44,388 --> 00:15:47,291
Our subjects of the report, Yunchuang, Le'an, and Dark Horse,

188
00:15:47,372 --> 00:15:48,533
have sent their representatives here.

189
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,642
And, there are many industry experts here.

190
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,882
What are you looking for? Did you hear me when I was talking to you?

191
00:15:58,135 --> 00:15:59,784
Yes. I...

192
00:16:02,825 --> 00:16:05,679
Excuse me, Shu Yi. I'm going to the restroom. You go first.

193
00:16:10,972 --> 00:16:12,372
Professor Yu.

194
00:16:13,918 --> 00:16:15,336
Miss Qin. Why are you here?

195
00:16:15,471 --> 00:16:16,920
Me? I came to look for you.

196
00:16:19,997 --> 00:16:21,635
I'm an intern journalist, right?

197
00:16:21,716 --> 00:16:23,768
I just wanted to learn more,

198
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:26,240
so I asked Guan Ji to bring me here.

199
00:16:28,122 --> 00:16:30,282
You know Guan Ji?

200
00:16:30,602 --> 00:16:31,842
Guan Ji brought you here?

201
00:16:32,506 --> 00:16:34,322
We're very good friends.

202
00:16:34,801 --> 00:16:36,122
What's wrong?

203
00:16:36,602 --> 00:16:37,802
Nothing.

204
00:16:38,162 --> 00:16:39,652
Then, you should learn well.

205
00:16:39,755 --> 00:16:41,155
I'm leaving first. Excuse me.

206
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,322
Why are you suddenly so cold?

207
00:16:48,537 --> 00:16:51,187
Shouldn't he like girls who love to study?

208
00:16:52,591 --> 00:16:54,754
- There's no way.   - You...

209
00:16:54,835 --> 00:16:56,402
They won't let it happen.

210
00:16:58,028 --> 00:17:00,077
We'll follow up on the report too.

211
00:17:00,475 --> 00:17:01,642
Okay.

212
00:17:07,489 --> 00:17:09,402
I still have something to do over there. Let's talk later.

213
00:17:09,483 --> 00:17:10,602
Okay.

214
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:14,665
I'll leave first.

215
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:17,002
Miss Bi.

216
00:17:19,193 --> 00:17:20,963
Are you looking for me, Mr. Guan?

217
00:17:22,952 --> 00:17:24,031
I still have something to do.

218
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:26,011
If you don't have anything else,

219
00:17:26,106 --> 00:17:27,442
I'll go first.

220
00:18:01,536 --> 00:18:04,042
You... Why did you guys come here?

221
00:18:04,233 --> 00:18:05,644
Come sit in the first row with me.

222
00:18:24,526 --> 00:18:26,497
I was invited by Mr. Shi.

223
00:18:26,602 --> 00:18:28,452
I'll just sit next to Mr. Shi.

224
00:18:49,642 --> 00:18:51,082
I'm going out to buy some coffee.

225
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:52,563
Do you want some?

226
00:18:54,355 --> 00:18:56,442
I'm just about to go out. Let's go together.

227
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,319
(Oh, you sneaky Shi Yan.)

228
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,440
(The pressure is on me now, right?)

229
00:19:08,562 --> 00:19:10,161
I stood up so quickly that I got a bit dizzy.

230
00:19:10,257 --> 00:19:11,602
I'll go in a bit.

231
00:19:14,641 --> 00:19:16,291
Americano, okay?

232
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:17,810
Okay. Thanks.

233
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:27,451
So...

234
00:19:27,578 --> 00:19:28,817
What do you want to say?

235
00:19:28,921 --> 00:19:30,321
That you two aren't familiar

236
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:31,909
and it's all a coincidence?

237
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:36,458
He and I are definitely not as familiar as you and I, right?

238
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,682
Hello. Would you mind switching seats with me?

239
00:19:46,787 --> 00:19:48,642
- Sure.   - Thanks.

240
00:19:54,441 --> 00:19:56,002
(If I did something wrong, )

241
00:19:56,082 --> 00:19:57,802
(please punish me by law)

242
00:19:57,892 --> 00:20:00,562
(instead of throwing me into this Shura battlefield.)

243
00:20:01,792 --> 00:20:02,993
Miss Zheng.

244
00:20:04,075 --> 00:20:05,242
Mr. Yi.

245
00:20:05,921 --> 00:20:07,082
You...

246
00:20:19,961 --> 00:20:21,972
Excuse me. Someone contacted me on WeChat.

247
00:20:28,082 --> 00:20:29,179
(You're awesome.)

248
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:32,281
(You even know the big shots and sit together with them.)

249
00:20:32,362 --> 00:20:34,162
(You don't have to worry about interviews in the future.)

250
00:20:35,441 --> 00:20:38,680
(You're indeed the top-tier financial journalist in our industry.)

251
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,202
(I feel the aura of a Shura battlefield.)

252
00:20:43,084 --> 00:20:44,522
Hi, Mr. Shi.

253
00:20:46,347 --> 00:20:47,747
We meet again.

254
00:20:48,921 --> 00:20:50,371
It's a bit frequent.

255
00:20:58,963 --> 00:21:00,882
A large latte with milk and sugar.

256
00:21:01,034 --> 00:21:03,162
- Okay. A moment, please.   - Thank you.

257
00:21:05,824 --> 00:21:07,385
One iced latte, please.

258
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:08,866
Okay. A moment, please.

259
00:21:12,056 --> 00:21:15,177
Hello. Four Americanos. Take away. Thank you.

260
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,770
Okay. A moment, please.

261
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:20,242
Professor Yu.

262
00:21:26,645 --> 00:21:29,122
- Can you add one more cup for me? Thank you.   - Sure.

263
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:36,762
Miss Qin. What a coincidence.

264
00:21:37,771 --> 00:21:38,810
Professor Yu.

265
00:21:38,961 --> 00:21:41,242
Don't you think it's a bit strange?

266
00:21:42,578 --> 00:21:45,577
I mean I always call you Professor Yu,

267
00:21:45,681 --> 00:21:47,322
but we've known each other for so long.

268
00:21:48,665 --> 00:21:50,436
From now on, you can call me Yu You.

269
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:55,882
Yu You.

270
00:21:58,426 --> 00:22:00,907
But, you call me Miss Qin.

271
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:02,682
It's quite strange as well.

272
00:22:04,845 --> 00:22:06,256
Let's be fair.

273
00:22:06,472 --> 00:22:09,122
You can call me Yue.

274
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,642
Where's Guan Ji?

275
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:20,242
Guan Ji.

276
00:22:22,703 --> 00:22:23,944
When we arrived here,

277
00:22:24,025 --> 00:22:25,988
he dropped me off at the hotel and disappeared.

278
00:22:26,538 --> 00:22:27,617
That's strange.

279
00:22:27,698 --> 00:22:30,125
Could it be that there's someone here that he's worried about?

280
00:22:30,206 --> 00:22:31,953
Hello. Your coffee is ready.

281
00:22:32,281 --> 00:22:33,562
Okay. Thanks.

282
00:22:37,897 --> 00:22:39,377
Americano is a bit bitter.

283
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:40,578
Is it okay?

284
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:41,940
Yes, it's fine.

285
00:22:42,021 --> 00:22:43,671
I like bitter stuff the most.

286
00:22:54,441 --> 00:22:55,722
This chip conference

287
00:22:55,802 --> 00:22:58,562
has semiconductor companies and experts gathering.

288
00:22:58,642 --> 00:23:02,399
There are up to 300 exhibitors and more than 10 industry forums.

289
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,201
It's truly unprecedented in scale.

290
00:23:04,281 --> 00:23:05,821
And, in this chip conference,

291
00:23:05,902 --> 00:23:07,219
the most anticipated forum

292
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,082
is the one that's about to start, the mmWave technology forum.

293
00:23:14,562 --> 00:23:16,051
What should I say next?

294
00:23:16,921 --> 00:23:18,002
Shan...

295
00:23:19,281 --> 00:23:20,482
Miss Bi.

296
00:23:21,761 --> 00:23:22,962
Mr. Guan.

297
00:23:23,042 --> 00:23:24,962
The forum is about to start.

298
00:23:25,162 --> 00:23:26,972
Why aren't you going in yet?

299
00:23:28,842 --> 00:23:30,242
Let's go in together.

300
00:23:31,897 --> 00:23:34,337
I still need to talk to my colleagues about the work afterward.

301
00:23:34,433 --> 00:23:37,482
And, your seat is in the front row of the VIP section.

302
00:23:37,562 --> 00:23:38,601
I'm in the media section.

303
00:23:38,681 --> 00:23:39,962
We can't sit together.

304
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,202
We can. I'll arrange it.

305
00:23:43,448 --> 00:23:44,642
You sit next to me.

306
00:23:46,201 --> 00:23:47,201
That's not appropriate.

307
00:23:47,281 --> 00:23:48,681
I'm going to work now.

308
00:24:08,207 --> 00:24:10,488
Do you need me to help you ask Guan Ji to come?

309
00:24:11,201 --> 00:24:12,601
No, no need.

310
00:24:14,418 --> 00:24:15,818
Which row are you sitting in?

311
00:24:16,667 --> 00:24:20,547
You must get me a seat at the back.

312
00:24:20,628 --> 00:24:23,172
The further away from my uncle, the better.

313
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:27,052
I'm sitting in the media section.

314
00:24:27,737 --> 00:24:30,097
I'm in the first row, slightly to the right.

315
00:24:35,666 --> 00:24:36,882
The forum is about to start.

316
00:24:36,967 --> 00:24:38,497
You should go in now.

317
00:24:38,891 --> 00:24:39,962
Okay.

318
00:24:46,691 --> 00:24:48,722
Qin Shi Yue.

319
00:24:49,023 --> 00:24:51,994
You are really smart, but being smart can be misleading.

320
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:55,690
With the popularization of 5G mobile communication

321
00:24:55,802 --> 00:24:57,772
and satellite communication,

322
00:24:57,961 --> 00:24:59,642
more and more people

323
00:24:59,802 --> 00:25:02,571
are feeling the power of mmWave.

324
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,930
Now, I'll let Professor Chen share his knowledge with us.

325
00:25:09,481 --> 00:25:12,802
The mmWave band doesn't have a precise definition.

326
00:25:13,001 --> 00:25:14,862
Generally, electromagnetic waves

327
00:25:14,979 --> 00:25:17,482
with frequencies from 30 to 300 GHz

328
00:25:17,681 --> 00:25:19,651
are called mmWaves.

329
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,680
It is located in the overlapping wavelength range

330
00:25:22,761 --> 00:25:25,131
of microwaves and far-infrared waves.

331
00:25:25,737 --> 00:25:28,322
Therefore, it has the characteristics of both spectra.

332
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,970
The theory and technology of mmWaves

333
00:25:31,122 --> 00:25:34,042
are respectively the extension of microwaves toward higher frequencies

334
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:36,859
and the development of light waves toward lower frequencies.

335
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:40,763
The mmWave technology actually has

336
00:25:40,892 --> 00:25:43,262
a wide range of applications in various fields.

337
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,582
With the popularization of 5G mobile communication

338
00:25:45,673 --> 00:25:47,722
and satellite communication,

339
00:25:47,964 --> 00:25:49,363
more and more people

340
00:25:49,521 --> 00:25:52,563
are experiencing the power of mmWaves. In addition...

341
00:25:52,643 --> 00:25:54,291
Phased array?

342
00:25:56,505 --> 00:25:59,921
Phased array radar is like a dragonfly's eyes.

343
00:26:00,001 --> 00:26:03,012
Inside each eye, there are many small eyes

344
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:05,802
which can search, track, and measure targets.

345
00:26:07,587 --> 00:26:10,562
Before, it was used more in military applications.

346
00:26:10,668 --> 00:26:12,676
What we are doing now is to make it more widely used in

347
00:26:12,757 --> 00:26:14,157
the civilian market.

348
00:26:15,267 --> 00:26:16,507
Thank you, Mr. Yi.

349
00:26:16,588 --> 00:26:17,988
It's the least I can do.

350
00:26:20,633 --> 00:26:23,153
If there's anything else you don't understand, just mark it down.

351
00:26:23,234 --> 00:26:24,804
I can explain it to you slowly.

352
00:26:28,006 --> 00:26:29,361
I used to be a teaching assistant,

353
00:26:29,442 --> 00:26:31,012
so I still have some teaching skills.

354
00:26:33,465 --> 00:26:36,482
These words are all explained in the conference manual.

355
00:26:36,631 --> 00:26:39,041
Listen carefully and don't miss the key points.

356
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,962
This will lead to higher power consumption.

357
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:46,082
That's all for my sharing with everyone.

358
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,642
Thank you.

359
00:26:51,627 --> 00:26:54,002
Thank you very much for your wonderful speech, Professor Li.

360
00:26:54,106 --> 00:26:56,065
Next, we invite Miss Chen from Guangxin Technology,

361
00:26:56,146 --> 00:26:57,482
a semiconductor company,

362
00:26:57,571 --> 00:26:58,612
to give us another talk.

363
00:26:58,693 --> 00:27:00,093
Let's give her a round of applause.

364
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:06,160
Photon-assisted mmWave phased array chips

365
00:27:06,274 --> 00:27:09,442
can be used for the link from iber to mmWave.

366
00:27:09,851 --> 00:27:11,251
In such a system,

367
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:14,330
baseband signals usually need to be processed at a centralized location.

368
00:27:14,411 --> 00:27:15,692
What's wrong again?

369
00:27:15,773 --> 00:27:17,527
And using optical fiber...

370
00:27:17,621 --> 00:27:19,153
After this session is over,

371
00:27:19,234 --> 00:27:20,804
I want to go back to the hotel.

372
00:27:21,481 --> 00:27:23,601
What's wrong? Not feeling well?

373
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:26,250
I'm fine.

374
00:27:28,354 --> 00:27:29,885
Let me know when you get there.

375
00:27:33,233 --> 00:27:34,602
You're going back to the hotel?

376
00:27:38,082 --> 00:27:40,282
I'm just going to get something.

377
00:27:40,452 --> 00:27:44,772
Also, I have an opinion that I want to share with everyone.

378
00:27:45,008 --> 00:27:48,608
I think data streams travel directly through light waves...

379
00:27:48,793 --> 00:27:50,942
Miss Zheng. I'll take you back to the hotel.

380
00:27:52,481 --> 00:27:53,962
Give me the notebook and recorder.

381
00:27:54,043 --> 00:27:55,162
Go back and rest well.

382
00:27:55,281 --> 00:27:58,522
...applicable to low-power compact radio head

383
00:27:58,602 --> 00:28:00,121
for over mmWave links.

384
00:28:00,202 --> 00:28:01,602
Thank you all.

385
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,882
At the circuit level,

386
00:28:10,096 --> 00:28:12,615
the challenge of mmWave phased array design

387
00:28:12,745 --> 00:28:14,786
includes electronics, routing,

388
00:28:14,882 --> 00:28:16,522
data processing...

389
00:28:32,059 --> 00:28:34,459
Professor Li Xue Cai, thank you for your generous sharing.

390
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:37,242
Let's take a break and see you in the second half.

391
00:28:48,417 --> 00:28:50,722
- I'm going to make a call.   - Okay.

392
00:28:50,802 --> 00:28:52,020
Mr. Shi.

393
00:28:52,235 --> 00:28:54,564
So, did Zheng Shu Yi come with you?

394
00:28:55,514 --> 00:28:57,593
- What happened to her?   - She's not feeling well.

395
00:28:57,674 --> 00:28:59,074
She's gone back to the hotel first.

396
00:29:03,362 --> 00:29:06,172
She's weak. She probably won't come in the afternoon either.

397
00:29:26,508 --> 00:29:27,582
Mr. Shi.

398
00:29:27,977 --> 00:29:29,938
Has she been sent off? How is she?

399
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:31,098
She has been sent back already.

400
00:29:31,179 --> 00:29:34,131
But, I saw her take a box of painkillers from the front desk.

401
00:29:34,723 --> 00:29:35,962
Painkillers?

402
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,562
For the lunch banquet, attend on my behalf.

403
00:29:48,431 --> 00:29:49,802
Why is it me again?

404
00:29:50,033 --> 00:29:52,842
I still want to rush back to the hotel to video chat with Kong Nan.

405
00:30:15,967 --> 00:30:18,082
Why are you here?

406
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:20,420
If I didn't come,

407
00:30:20,579 --> 00:30:22,898
were you planning to suffer all by yourself?

408
00:30:23,331 --> 00:30:25,011
(He knew I was sick.)

409
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:26,843
(He came back specially to see me.)

410
00:30:33,441 --> 00:30:34,841
What's wrong?

411
00:30:35,394 --> 00:30:36,794
I'm in pain.

412
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:38,818
Where does it hurt?

413
00:30:38,955 --> 00:30:40,355
It hurts everywhere.

414
00:30:44,747 --> 00:30:46,437
Actually, it's not that bad.

415
00:30:46,681 --> 00:30:48,242
Just say two comforting words to me.

416
00:30:50,194 --> 00:30:51,594
What should I say?

417
00:30:52,602 --> 00:30:54,322
Just say,

418
00:30:54,979 --> 00:30:56,698
"I haven't gone to heaven yet.

419
00:30:56,779 --> 00:30:58,571
How come I've already seen a fairy?"

420
00:31:04,241 --> 00:31:07,922
Go to sleep. I'm right here, little fairy.

421
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:31,082
(He seems to be really prepared to stay here.)

422
00:31:31,362 --> 00:31:35,841
(That's good. At least someone will respond when I'm shouting in pain.)

423
00:31:41,224 --> 00:31:45,384
What exactly hurts? Your head, stomach, or somewhere else?

424
00:31:46,921 --> 00:31:48,321
It's my period.

425
00:31:50,969 --> 00:31:52,500
Be careful in the future

426
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:54,562
and don't wear short skirts.

427
00:31:54,882 --> 00:31:57,412
(You jerk. Do you know how to comfort people?)

428
00:31:58,362 --> 00:32:01,131
Why do you think I'm wearing a short skirt?

429
00:32:01,362 --> 00:32:02,811
It's for looking good.

430
00:32:03,527 --> 00:32:06,058
You don't have to wear a short skirt to look good.

431
00:32:09,721 --> 00:32:11,121
Sleep now.

432
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,882
(Demand and Application of Silicon Carbide Material Technology)

433
00:33:09,355 --> 00:33:11,205
(She has a pet at home?)

434
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:25,954
Hey, Mom.

435
00:33:26,035 --> 00:33:28,995
(Yi. What are you doing? Why are you taking so long to answer the phone?)

436
00:33:29,076 --> 00:33:30,476
I'm taking a nap.

437
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,730
(It's already late afternoon. Why are you sleeping?)

438
00:33:33,456 --> 00:33:35,058
Nothing. Just tired.

439
00:33:35,162 --> 00:33:36,401
(If nothing's wrong, )

440
00:33:36,511 --> 00:33:38,962
(why don't you go and meet Yu You?)

441
00:33:39,224 --> 00:33:41,679
Can't I just rest on the weekend?

442
00:33:41,761 --> 00:33:43,121
(You should go out with him for a meal.)

443
00:33:43,201 --> 00:33:45,042
(Watching a movie is also a way to rest.)

444
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:48,362
(Wasn't there a romance movie recently?)

445
00:33:48,458 --> 00:33:49,618
(I saw that your cousins)

446
00:33:49,699 --> 00:33:51,379
(are posting about it in their WeChat Moments.)

447
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,442
- (Why don't you guys go check it out?)   - Mom.

448
00:33:53,523 --> 00:33:54,923
Actually, I have something...

449
00:33:59,378 --> 00:34:01,857
I'll tell you when I go home for Chinese New Year. Okay?

450
00:34:01,967 --> 00:34:04,682
(How come you suddenly want to tell me when you come home?)

451
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:07,441
(If you really don't like him, just tell me.)

452
00:34:07,521 --> 00:34:08,802
(I won't force you.)

453
00:34:08,931 --> 00:34:11,411
Yeah. I really don't like that one.

454
00:34:11,492 --> 00:34:14,332
(Then, tell me. I will help you look for someone else.)

455
00:34:14,413 --> 00:34:16,122
Didn't I send you a photo?

456
00:34:21,706 --> 00:34:23,277
Are your parents pushing you to date?

457
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:28,560
No. My mom asked me to pick a dog.

458
00:34:31,145 --> 00:34:32,794
So, what kind of dog do you like?

459
00:34:35,754 --> 00:34:38,074
I like the ones that are a bit more obedient

460
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:41,691
and listen better, like the Chinese rural dog.

461
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:45,689
Zheng Shu Yi,

462
00:34:45,793 --> 00:34:48,683
you are really giving me a headache.

463
00:34:49,602 --> 00:34:51,492
Then, I'll give you some painkillers.

464
00:34:54,201 --> 00:34:55,601
Are you sleeping yet?

465
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,970
I'm sleeping.

466
00:34:58,631 --> 00:35:01,162
Don't you have a meeting at 3 o'clock? You go first.

467
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:02,442
I'm fine.

468
00:35:07,922 --> 00:35:09,771
Send me a message if there's anything wrong.

469
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:13,650
Bye.

470
00:35:33,721 --> 00:35:37,082
- Hello.   - (Mr. Shi. Professor Li Xue Cai is in a hurry to leave now.)

471
00:35:37,162 --> 00:35:38,522
(Are you coming?)

472
00:35:38,602 --> 00:35:40,091
Got it. I'm coming right away.

473
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,851
I'm so hungry.

474
00:36:07,547 --> 00:36:08,706
Shan Shan.

475
00:36:08,818 --> 00:36:10,042
What are you doing here?

476
00:36:10,188 --> 00:36:12,799
I heard you were sick. I came to check on you.

477
00:36:16,395 --> 00:36:19,119
Are you really sick?

478
00:36:19,241 --> 00:36:20,641
Or did you...

479
00:36:20,834 --> 00:36:22,402
Stop talking about nonsense.

480
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,210
I'm on my period.

481
00:36:25,482 --> 00:36:27,362
It hurts so much that I almost passed out.

482
00:36:27,888 --> 00:36:29,338
Have you taken any painkillers?

483
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,771
Oh no. Is everyone visiting me?

484
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,089
Miss Zheng. Your order is here.

485
00:36:47,201 --> 00:36:48,601
I didn't order anything.

486
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:52,020
Isn't this Room 2406?

487
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,210
It's me. Thank you.

488
00:37:01,418 --> 00:37:04,137
Chen. I can feel your sincerity.

489
00:37:04,241 --> 00:37:06,171
Mr. Shi is a very busy person.

490
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:08,161
Look at the time. If I don't leave now,

491
00:37:08,241 --> 00:37:09,241
I won't make it to the high-speed train.

492
00:37:09,322 --> 00:37:10,482
Let's talk next time.

493
00:37:10,746 --> 00:37:11,746
Please wait a bit more.

494
00:37:11,827 --> 00:37:13,227
Mr. Shi will be here soon.

495
00:37:13,361 --> 00:37:15,651
Later, I can take you to the train station.

496
00:37:19,579 --> 00:37:20,979
Mr. Shi is here.

497
00:37:26,281 --> 00:37:27,922
Hello, Professor Li. I'm Shi Yan.

498
00:37:28,002 --> 00:37:29,121
Hello, Shi Yan.

499
00:37:29,201 --> 00:37:30,641
Sorry for making you wait.

500
00:37:30,721 --> 00:37:33,206
I have long admired your achievements in mmWave communications,

501
00:37:33,287 --> 00:37:35,808
and I'd love to talk to you and get your guidance.

502
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,242
I'm honored.

503
00:37:37,442 --> 00:37:39,042
This isn't just my own achievement.

504
00:37:39,122 --> 00:37:41,096
It's the result of the whole research team.

505
00:37:41,245 --> 00:37:43,560
No one wants to take the credit, and I'm asked to be the representative.

506
00:37:43,642 --> 00:37:44,721
I'm embarrassed about that.

507
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,160
You're too humble. You're catching a high-speed train, right?

508
00:37:47,241 --> 00:37:49,260
- Yes.   - Why don't I give you a ride?

509
00:37:49,591 --> 00:37:51,191
That's too kind of you. Let's chat on the way.

510
00:37:51,272 --> 00:37:52,322
Please.

511
00:38:01,881 --> 00:38:03,281
(Thank you, boss.)

512
00:38:04,123 --> 00:38:05,523
(Who's your boss?)

513
00:38:21,563 --> 00:38:23,653
That girl's uncle is good.

514
00:38:24,042 --> 00:38:26,042
He's considerate.

515
00:38:26,963 --> 00:38:29,202
He's too considerate.

516
00:38:29,657 --> 00:38:32,338
He sent someone to take me back to the hotel. Then, he came here himself.

517
00:38:32,464 --> 00:38:34,122
He stayed with me until I woke up.

518
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,691
He was on his way to becoming a perfect boyfriend.

519
00:38:42,202 --> 00:38:45,082
But the nicer he is to me, the more uneasy I feel.

520
00:38:45,162 --> 00:38:46,562
I feel sorry for him.

521
00:38:47,377 --> 00:38:48,657
Shan Shan.

522
00:38:48,761 --> 00:38:51,651
On the day I set off for Fucheng, Yue Xing Zhou came looking for me.

523
00:38:51,732 --> 00:38:54,022
How dare he come looking for you?

524
00:38:57,002 --> 00:38:58,892
He didn't request to get back together, did he?

525
00:38:59,298 --> 00:39:01,459
You mustn't be tempted by him.

526
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,940
I won't.

527
00:39:03,788 --> 00:39:05,667
It's just that he told me that day

528
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,240
I was only getting close to Shi Yan for revenge.

529
00:39:08,321 --> 00:39:09,495
Even he thought that way.

530
00:39:09,602 --> 00:39:11,842
If Shi Yan knew about my relationship with his niece,

531
00:39:11,946 --> 00:39:13,562
he would definitely think the same.

532
00:39:13,649 --> 00:39:16,330
Rather than waiting for his niece to tell him and let him guess,

533
00:39:16,426 --> 00:39:18,482
it's better for me to tell him honestly and clearly now.

534
00:39:18,874 --> 00:39:22,244
You definitely shouldn't do that.

535
00:39:23,002 --> 00:39:24,412
Think it through.

536
00:39:24,493 --> 00:39:26,413
You've only been together for a short while.

537
00:39:26,538 --> 00:39:27,600
And now, you're telling him

538
00:39:27,681 --> 00:39:29,721
that it was all because you wanted to get back at your ex?

539
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:31,282
Will he accept that?

540
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:33,898
He'll definitely feel like he's been wronged.

541
00:39:34,053 --> 00:39:35,522
Then, he'll try to cut his losses

542
00:39:35,619 --> 00:39:37,219
and break up with you.

543
00:39:37,377 --> 00:39:40,058
But, I'm with him now because I really do like him.

544
00:39:40,184 --> 00:39:41,834
I believe you.

545
00:39:42,002 --> 00:39:43,241
But, the problem now is

546
00:39:43,361 --> 00:39:45,042
whether Shi Yan will believe you.

547
00:39:45,178 --> 00:39:46,939
Can he bear your deception?

548
00:39:47,082 --> 00:39:48,482
Are you the only one in his heart?

549
00:39:48,562 --> 00:39:51,042
If he finds out later and wants to break up with you,

550
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:53,761
can you accept losing him?

551
00:39:55,562 --> 00:39:56,962
If you break up,

552
00:39:57,281 --> 00:39:59,492
what will happen to your digital magazine?

553
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:03,027
I know the consequences are serious

554
00:40:03,122 --> 00:40:04,892
but I just don't want to deceive him anymore.

555
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,762
Listen to me and wait a bit more.

556
00:40:08,042 --> 00:40:09,972
Now is not the right time.

557
00:40:11,681 --> 00:40:14,651
Wait until he loves you so much that he can't bear to be apart from you.

558
00:40:15,201 --> 00:40:16,601
Then, be honest with him.

559
00:40:17,162 --> 00:40:19,162
When will that be?

560
00:40:19,493 --> 00:40:21,303
Will there really be such a day?

561
00:40:27,241 --> 00:40:28,281
Professor Li.

562
00:40:28,361 --> 00:40:30,002
Although I'm not from a technical background,

563
00:40:30,082 --> 00:40:32,482
Chen Kang from Le'an and I have the same vision,

564
00:40:32,642 --> 00:40:35,402
that is to create a chip that belongs to China.

565
00:40:35,483 --> 00:40:37,132
That's why I invested in Le'an.

566
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:39,242
Right now, Le'an is facing a difficult situation,

567
00:40:39,323 --> 00:40:43,122
so I urgently hope to get your guidance and help.

568
00:40:44,232 --> 00:40:46,282
I saw Chen Kang a few years ago.

569
00:40:46,371 --> 00:40:48,282
He was a spirited young man,

570
00:40:48,443 --> 00:40:49,722
leading his team

571
00:40:49,817 --> 00:40:51,137
and devoted to technology.

572
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:52,641
It was admirable.

573
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:55,980
So, if I can help him and Le'an,

574
00:40:56,522 --> 00:40:57,922
I will do my best.

575
00:40:58,352 --> 00:40:59,482
You...

576
00:41:00,423 --> 00:41:02,034
I thought...

577
00:41:03,131 --> 00:41:05,140
You didn't expect I would agree so readily, right?

578
00:41:06,201 --> 00:41:09,297
Recently, I read an interview of him.

579
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,920
He's been through a lot.

580
00:41:11,003 --> 00:41:12,282
It's not been easy for him.

581
00:41:12,363 --> 00:41:14,013
You young people are so brave.

582
00:41:14,602 --> 00:41:17,601
I believe that your wishes will soon come true.

583
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:20,757
Thank you for your generosity. So, I'll just cut to the chase.

584
00:41:21,122 --> 00:41:22,722
I hope you and your laboratory

585
00:41:22,802 --> 00:41:24,292
can collaborate with Le'an

586
00:41:24,376 --> 00:41:26,666
to break through this technical problem.

587
00:41:27,291 --> 00:41:28,691
To be honest,

588
00:41:28,962 --> 00:41:30,532
I'm not very confident.

589
00:41:30,827 --> 00:41:33,442
However, I can take my team to Le'an

590
00:41:33,522 --> 00:41:34,761
for learning and exchange

591
00:41:34,841 --> 00:41:37,522
and then see if we can be of help.

592
00:41:37,876 --> 00:41:39,436
What do you think, Mr. Shi?

593
00:41:39,594 --> 00:41:41,474
That's great. Thank you, Professor Li.

594
00:41:41,562 --> 00:41:43,601
Then, Chen Kang and I will be waiting for you in Le'an.

595
00:41:43,681 --> 00:41:44,842
Okay.

596
00:42:00,673 --> 00:42:02,284
Shi Yan.

597
00:42:03,082 --> 00:42:04,611
You're so smart.

598
00:42:05,241 --> 00:42:07,091
Why don't you teach me what to do?

599
00:42:14,697 --> 00:42:16,467
Senior Chen, long time no see.

600
00:42:16,955 --> 00:42:18,154
(Long time no see.)

601
00:42:18,235 --> 00:42:19,635
(How have you been lately?)

602
00:42:19,716 --> 00:42:21,317
I'm doing great. I'm working.

603
00:42:21,398 --> 00:42:22,518
(Let me cut to the chase then.)

604
00:42:22,642 --> 00:42:26,362
(It's like this. I'm getting married next month.)

605
00:42:26,696 --> 00:42:28,177
Really? So soon?

606
00:42:28,281 --> 00:42:29,761
(What do you mean by soon?)

607
00:42:29,864 --> 00:42:31,274
(We've been together for two years.)

608
00:42:31,401 --> 00:42:33,430
(The wedding is on the fourth day of Chinese New Year.)

609
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,111
- (Will you come?)   - I'll be there.

610
00:42:35,192 --> 00:42:36,592
I have to be there.

611
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:38,730
(By the way...)

612
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,440
- What's up?   - (I was looking at my WeChat Moments recently)

613
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:46,051
(and noticed that you and Yue Xing Zhou seem to be...)

614
00:42:46,377 --> 00:42:47,802
(I'm not prying or anything.)

615
00:42:47,907 --> 00:42:49,586
(I just thought that back in college, )

616
00:42:49,681 --> 00:42:51,482
(he and I had a pretty good relationship.)

617
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:53,201
- (Then...)   - It's fine.

618
00:42:53,281 --> 00:42:54,402
You can invite him.

619
00:42:54,483 --> 00:42:55,842
What's the big deal?

620
00:42:55,962 --> 00:42:58,121
It's between us two. It shouldn't affect you.

621
00:42:58,442 --> 00:42:59,762
(I know.)

622
00:42:59,922 --> 00:43:01,522
(I called him in the morning.)

623
00:43:01,657 --> 00:43:04,217
(But his current girlfriend seems to be there too, )

624
00:43:04,352 --> 00:43:06,363
(saying they are coming together to attend the wedding.)
