1
00:01:31,202 --> 00:01:36,081
(Only For Love)

2
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:39,002
(Episode 36)

3
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,204
(The investment company behind Le'an, Mingyu Yunchuang, )

4
00:01:42,285 --> 00:01:44,202
(has been questioned by many parties.)

5
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:53,799
Mr. Shi, many media have invited you for an interview.

6
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:55,308
They hope you can share your thoughts

7
00:01:55,332 --> 00:01:57,682
on the collaboration between Le'an and Dark Horse.

8
00:01:58,139 --> 00:01:59,442
Turn them down.

9
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:13,413
(Le'an collaborates with Dark Horse)

10
00:02:13,437 --> 00:02:15,757
(Doubts arise over Yunchuang's post-investment management)

11
00:02:22,682 --> 00:02:23,882
Yes, this is the one.

12
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:25,322
I have to take this.

13
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:33,002
Miss Zheng, are you looking for Mr. Shi?

14
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,944
(He's in the office. You can just call him.)

15
00:02:35,047 --> 00:02:37,200
No, I'm looking for you.

16
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,082
(I'd like to schedule an interview with Mr. Shi.)

17
00:02:41,121 --> 00:02:44,042
It's about the collaboration between Le'an and Dark Horse.

18
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,202
(Miss Zheng, )

19
00:02:47,346 --> 00:02:49,762
Mr. Shi has asked me to decline all media interviews.

20
00:02:50,761 --> 00:02:53,802
I suppose he hasn't explained the details to you yet.

21
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,922
This matter involves more than just Yunchuang.

22
00:02:57,172 --> 00:03:00,320
(Mr. Shi doesn't want to put both companies in the spotlight)

23
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,657
(during this crucial period of cooperation between Le'an and Dark Horse, )

24
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:04,402
affecting their collaboration.

25
00:03:04,945 --> 00:03:06,144
Therefore,

26
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,442
he chose to bear everything on his own.

27
00:03:09,038 --> 00:03:11,242
(Miss Zheng, I know you're just doing your job, )

28
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:15,124
(but Mr. Shi has his considerations and decisions.)

29
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,922
I'm ho...

30
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,425
Shu Yi.

31
00:03:50,351 --> 00:03:51,602
What are you reading?

32
00:03:52,417 --> 00:03:54,242
When did you get home?

33
00:03:58,753 --> 00:04:00,042
Is something bothering you?

34
00:04:00,794 --> 00:04:01,794
Nothing.

35
00:04:05,029 --> 00:04:07,909
- What are you doing? - I will look at it myself if you won't tell me.

36
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:09,849
We don't keep secrets from each other anymore.

37
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,563
I called Chen Sheng today.

38
00:04:30,153 --> 00:04:32,562
I know you're under a lot of pressure.

39
00:04:33,344 --> 00:04:35,082
You don't want to face the media.

40
00:04:36,036 --> 00:04:38,522
But there are things that can still be clarified.

41
00:04:39,144 --> 00:04:40,962
Words carry attitudes,

42
00:04:41,137 --> 00:04:42,842
and readers have thoughts on their own.

43
00:04:44,087 --> 00:04:47,082
Don't bear all of this alone, okay?

44
00:04:52,664 --> 00:04:55,002
I'm not opposed to media interviews.

45
00:04:55,849 --> 00:04:58,842
I just don't want to stir up more controversy at this stage.

46
00:04:59,196 --> 00:05:00,922
Whatever I say now

47
00:05:01,304 --> 00:05:03,882
won't substantially help their R&D,

48
00:05:04,157 --> 00:05:06,026
and it might fuel public opinion.

49
00:05:08,824 --> 00:05:11,212
If they really achieve technological breakthrough this time,

50
00:05:11,236 --> 00:05:14,394
they'll know that I made the right choice.

51
00:05:16,904 --> 00:05:18,082
Shu Yi,

52
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:19,659
do you understand me?

53
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,309
I understand.

54
00:05:25,624 --> 00:05:27,482
I can hold off on interviewing you for now,

55
00:05:27,784 --> 00:05:31,522
but when you get home, if there's anything you want to talk about,

56
00:05:31,603 --> 00:05:33,863
let me share the burden with you, accompany you.

57
00:05:54,664 --> 00:05:55,664
Take a seat.

58
00:05:57,464 --> 00:05:59,264
I'd like to talk to you about Yunchuang.

59
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:02,330
Ms. Yi, I came to talk to you about that too.

60
00:06:04,304 --> 00:06:06,024
Regarding the recent events with Yunchuang,

61
00:06:06,142 --> 00:06:08,030
I think we can observe and then follow up.

62
00:06:08,224 --> 00:06:09,362
Shu Yi,

63
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,162
I hope you're not saying this

64
00:06:11,264 --> 00:06:13,122
because Shi Yan is your boyfriend.

65
00:06:13,944 --> 00:06:16,183
Work is work, and life is life.

66
00:06:16,264 --> 00:06:17,558
I can separate the two.

67
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,002
I have my own considerations.

68
00:06:19,109 --> 00:06:20,623
The two companies have just started collaborating,

69
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:22,320
and there hasn't been any substantial progress.

70
00:06:22,344 --> 00:06:23,802
What can I write?

71
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:25,542
Emotional and subjective writing

72
00:06:25,623 --> 00:06:27,802
is not the style of our magazine and me.

73
00:06:28,024 --> 00:06:30,668
We need to make objective analyses and express viewpoints

74
00:06:30,749 --> 00:06:32,202
based on facts.

75
00:06:33,323 --> 00:06:35,122
Clear and well-reasoned.

76
00:06:35,704 --> 00:06:38,402
It seems nothing I say can change your mind.

77
00:06:39,116 --> 00:06:40,202
That's right.

78
00:06:40,356 --> 00:06:42,802
I've also consulted the interviewees' wishes.

79
00:06:43,063 --> 00:06:44,859
I believe personal lives and careers

80
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,322
can coexist peacefully,

81
00:06:46,464 --> 00:06:47,882
and even benefit each other.

82
00:06:49,384 --> 00:06:50,406
Is that so?

83
00:06:51,237 --> 00:06:52,666
Show me how it works then.

84
00:06:52,747 --> 00:06:54,608
You got it. Thanks, Ms. Yi.

85
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:11,783
This is just too much.

86
00:07:11,902 --> 00:07:13,143
Unbelievable.

87
00:07:13,249 --> 00:07:16,762
How can they piece together an article like this?

88
00:07:17,544 --> 00:07:19,642
Do these people no longer care about the truth?

89
00:07:19,917 --> 00:07:21,863
They even speak ill of Yunchuang and Shi Yan

90
00:07:21,951 --> 00:07:23,591
just for the sake of getting more clicks.

91
00:07:24,664 --> 00:07:25,803
Look at this.

92
00:07:35,696 --> 00:07:38,096
I'm sure you all have been following the recent developments

93
00:07:38,144 --> 00:07:39,722
with Yunchuang, Le'an, and Dark Horse.

94
00:07:40,015 --> 00:07:42,054
We did a feature on Yunchuang before

95
00:07:42,158 --> 00:07:44,722
and interviewed the founders of Le'an and Dark Horse.

96
00:07:44,904 --> 00:07:47,122
We should follow up on this event.

97
00:07:48,584 --> 00:07:50,122
Who will take on this assignment?

98
00:07:57,464 --> 00:07:59,642
It's a great opportunity.

99
00:07:59,869 --> 00:08:02,122
You should all be eager to try.

100
00:08:02,363 --> 00:08:04,442
Show some spirits of exploration now.

101
00:08:08,709 --> 00:08:11,442
Ms. Yi, I'd like to take on this assignment.

102
00:08:11,711 --> 00:08:12,762
Why are you...

103
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,882
I respect the wishes of the interviewees,

104
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,020
but I also have a journalistic stance to uphold.

105
00:08:36,992 --> 00:08:38,602
(As Le'an's investor, )

106
00:08:38,744 --> 00:08:41,482
(the CEO of Yunchuang sees the situation clearly.)

107
00:08:41,586 --> 00:08:43,216
(From a technical perspective, )

108
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:47,162
(Le'an has a mature team and production line that surpasses Dark Horse, )

109
00:08:47,263 --> 00:08:50,682
(while Dark Horse has core technical experts like Bruce.)

110
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:53,250
(The strengths and weaknesses of both companies are apparent.)

111
00:08:53,403 --> 00:08:56,003
(A simple assessment of strength and weakness is not sufficient.)

112
00:08:56,655 --> 00:08:57,973
(Despite appearing to be at an impasse, )

113
00:08:57,997 --> 00:08:59,717
(Le'an, by collaborating with Dark Horse, )

114
00:08:59,798 --> 00:09:01,402
(is recognizing the situation)

115
00:09:01,544 --> 00:09:03,962
(and actively seeking breakthroughs for the greater good.)

116
00:09:04,268 --> 00:09:06,882
(As a rising star in the industry, Dark Horse may not be able)

117
00:09:07,006 --> 00:09:09,762
(to achieve a breakthrough in technical challenges on its own, )

118
00:09:09,878 --> 00:09:11,614
(collaborating with the experienced Le'an)

119
00:09:11,695 --> 00:09:13,762
(is a mutually beneficial choice.)

120
00:09:16,784 --> 00:09:18,783
(This article is detailed and informative.)

121
00:09:18,864 --> 00:09:19,997
(I also think it's the best option)

122
00:09:20,021 --> 00:09:21,160
(for the two companies to collaborate.)

123
00:09:21,184 --> 00:09:23,735
(I've been following Miss Zheng's special reports on Yunchuang.)

124
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:24,915
(I really like her writing style, )

125
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,699
(objective yet with a distinct perspective.)

126
00:09:26,728 --> 00:09:28,004
(I hope Miss Zheng continues to cover)

127
00:09:28,028 --> 00:09:29,659
(the follow-up of Le'an and Dark Horse's collaboration.)

128
00:09:29,683 --> 00:09:31,482
(Shi Yan is quite something.)

129
00:09:39,904 --> 00:09:41,108
You're home.

130
00:09:41,235 --> 00:09:42,496
Are you making soup for me?

131
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,762
Thank you.

132
00:09:48,596 --> 00:09:49,922
Thank me for what?

133
00:09:51,104 --> 00:09:52,404
Just thank you.

134
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,522
Well, how do you plan to thank me?

135
00:10:00,505 --> 00:10:04,482
How about doing an exclusive interview centered around the five questions

136
00:10:04,614 --> 00:10:06,322
you mentioned in the article?

137
00:10:10,397 --> 00:10:12,362
- This is good. - Uncle Tian, Uncle Zhang.

138
00:10:13,424 --> 00:10:14,854
Shi Yan, we were just talking about you.

139
00:10:14,878 --> 00:10:15,885
Come, sit.

140
00:10:15,966 --> 00:10:17,185
Sit.

141
00:10:17,464 --> 00:10:19,122
Do you know what we are looking at?

142
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,454
We are reading the comments under your article.

143
00:10:22,864 --> 00:10:23,973
These comments have significantly

144
00:10:23,997 --> 00:10:26,485
changed people's views on both you and Yunchuang.

145
00:10:26,588 --> 00:10:28,068
And the industry is highly optimistic

146
00:10:28,097 --> 00:10:31,174
about the cooperation between Le'an and Dark Horse.

147
00:10:32,384 --> 00:10:33,946
I had thought

148
00:10:34,184 --> 00:10:35,760
you were sacrificing the essential for the sake of the trivial,

149
00:10:35,784 --> 00:10:37,300
using a roundabout way to achieve your goals.

150
00:10:37,324 --> 00:10:39,543
Unexpectedly, he employed a move of leveraging strength

151
00:10:39,623 --> 00:10:41,042
to turn the tide.

152
00:10:43,664 --> 00:10:46,482
We have to admit that we really are old.

153
00:10:47,184 --> 00:10:50,241
The future is the era of you young people.

154
00:10:50,322 --> 00:10:51,522
That's right.

155
00:10:51,664 --> 00:10:54,562
Uncles, your encouragement means a lot to me.

156
00:10:54,704 --> 00:10:56,842
I hope I haven't disappointed you

157
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:58,492
and the shareholders of Yunchuang.

158
00:10:59,046 --> 00:11:00,395
Nonsense.

159
00:11:00,838 --> 00:11:02,962
Your father would also be proud of you.

160
00:11:03,117 --> 00:11:04,922
Fei Fei has always told me

161
00:11:05,077 --> 00:11:07,882
that Shi Yan has new ideas, a broad vision,

162
00:11:08,064 --> 00:11:09,360
and asked me not to worry so much,

163
00:11:09,384 --> 00:11:10,882
to put my heart at ease.

164
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,901
Now it seems that I was really overly concerned.

165
00:11:15,964 --> 00:11:17,162
Shi Yan,

166
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,059
you have really grown.

167
00:11:23,504 --> 00:11:25,464
The integrated media team has taken initial shape

168
00:11:25,617 --> 00:11:27,093
and has its own operational model.

169
00:11:27,223 --> 00:11:29,402
Moving forward, we will accelerate

170
00:11:29,516 --> 00:11:30,846
the expansion of integrated media business

171
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:33,270
and establish a more comprehensive organizational structure.

172
00:11:33,584 --> 00:11:36,402
This task will be entrusted to Zheng Shu Yi.

173
00:11:37,287 --> 00:11:39,024
I have discussed it with the editor-in-chief.

174
00:11:39,048 --> 00:11:40,728
We will prioritize our internal resources.

175
00:11:40,864 --> 00:11:43,502
If any of you are interested in joining the integrated media team,

176
00:11:43,526 --> 00:11:45,282
you can talk to Shu Yi.

177
00:11:46,829 --> 00:11:48,202
Is there anything else?

178
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,254
- No. - Meeting adjourned.

179
00:11:56,463 --> 00:11:57,864
Come here. Come.

180
00:11:57,944 --> 00:11:59,584
No. I'm not ready.

181
00:11:59,664 --> 00:12:01,060
Go! Just go!

182
00:12:01,141 --> 00:12:02,762
Go.

183
00:12:03,904 --> 00:12:05,082
What are you two doing?

184
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:08,402
Shu Yi, Bei Er needs to talk to you.

185
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:10,122
What's wrong, Bei Er?

186
00:12:10,743 --> 00:12:12,202
Shu Yi...

187
00:12:12,463 --> 00:12:14,294
I mean, I...

188
00:12:15,762 --> 00:12:16,782
I...

189
00:12:16,863 --> 00:12:18,334
I would like to...

190
00:12:19,064 --> 00:12:21,103
She wants to join our integrated media team.

191
00:12:21,184 --> 00:12:22,184
No...

192
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,760
Really?

193
00:12:24,129 --> 00:12:25,602
Have you thought it through?

194
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,679
Actually, I've been thinking about it for a while.

195
00:12:28,736 --> 00:12:30,003
Well...

196
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:32,962
Before, it was because...

197
00:12:34,623 --> 00:12:35,983
Shu Yi,

198
00:12:36,126 --> 00:12:40,075
I really like to learn from you how to be a good financial journalist.

199
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:41,370
I mean it.

200
00:12:42,424 --> 00:12:43,944
I can be very strict, you know.

201
00:12:44,062 --> 00:12:45,442
If you don't believe me, ask Yue.

202
00:12:47,413 --> 00:12:49,764
I know. I want you to be strict with me

203
00:12:49,845 --> 00:12:51,314
so that I can improve.

204
00:12:53,424 --> 00:12:55,402
All right, I'll think about it.

205
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,003
I've decided.

206
00:13:03,084 --> 00:13:04,762
I'm going to assign more tasks

207
00:13:04,944 --> 00:13:06,374
to you and Yue.

208
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,802
Thank you, Shu Yi.

209
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,406
Guys, this is our new intern,

210
00:13:14,526 --> 00:13:15,762
Hu Qing Hua.

211
00:13:16,024 --> 00:13:17,024
Hi, everyone.

212
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,150
Hi, everyone.

213
00:13:19,703 --> 00:13:21,722
I'm the new integrated media editor.

214
00:13:21,877 --> 00:13:23,482
Looking forward to working with you all.

215
00:13:24,129 --> 00:13:25,768
Your desk is right over there.

216
00:13:25,903 --> 00:13:27,442
- I'll leave you be then. - Okay.

217
00:13:27,544 --> 00:13:29,504
- Thank you, You Ran. - No problem.

218
00:13:32,304 --> 00:13:34,002
- Hello. - Hello.

219
00:13:36,254 --> 00:13:38,562
Hello, I'm Hu Qing Hua.

220
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:39,816
I know.

221
00:13:39,937 --> 00:13:41,162
Hi, I'm Cheng Bei Er.

222
00:13:41,273 --> 00:13:43,522
How... How did you know?

223
00:13:43,744 --> 00:13:47,054
Didn't you just tell us yourself?

224
00:13:49,122 --> 00:13:50,322
Oh, right.

225
00:13:54,116 --> 00:13:55,256
Good luck.

226
00:13:57,649 --> 00:13:58,762
Good luck, Auntie.

227
00:13:58,868 --> 00:14:01,629
Team leader of the integrated media team, you're the one for the job.

228
00:14:03,144 --> 00:14:04,522
Congratulations, team leader.

229
00:14:04,696 --> 00:14:05,853
It hasn't been made official yet.

230
00:14:05,877 --> 00:14:08,362
Don't call me that. People will mock me.

231
00:14:08,483 --> 00:14:10,522
It's pretty much set in stone.

232
00:14:10,828 --> 00:14:12,831
Shu Yi, I've set up your equipment.

233
00:14:12,912 --> 00:14:14,190
If you need any help, just ask me.

234
00:14:14,214 --> 00:14:15,642
- Thank you. - Good luck.

235
00:14:20,405 --> 00:14:22,345
Editor-in-chief and leaders.

236
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:25,642
Relax.

237
00:14:25,757 --> 00:14:27,122
Just be your usual self.

238
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:28,602
You will be fine.

239
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,064
The integrated media team has been established for a while,

240
00:14:34,143 --> 00:14:36,063
and our digital magazine is thriving.

241
00:14:36,196 --> 00:14:38,762
This is thanks to the efforts and persistence of Zheng Shu Yi.

242
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,864
As the integrated media team is getting on track,

243
00:14:41,969 --> 00:14:44,135
Financial Introduce is full of confidence and expectations

244
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:45,922
for the future development and layout.

245
00:14:46,144 --> 00:14:47,757
So, today's discussion will focus on

246
00:14:47,877 --> 00:14:50,618
the selection of the team leader for the integrated media team.

247
00:14:50,838 --> 00:14:53,189
First, Zheng Shu Yi will present her work report.

248
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:05,704
Establishing the digital magazine for the integrated media team was seen

249
00:15:05,854 --> 00:15:08,083
as a somewhat distant dream by many,

250
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:09,842
but with the support of our leaders

251
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,660
and the hard work of me and my colleagues,

252
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:14,082
this dream has become a reality.

253
00:15:14,305 --> 00:15:16,202
And I can confidently say

254
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:18,614
that our digital magazine is not only visually appealing and interesting,

255
00:15:18,638 --> 00:15:20,882
but we can also do even better in the future.

256
00:15:24,384 --> 00:15:25,637
News may be transient,

257
00:15:25,731 --> 00:15:28,564
but the people, stories, and meanings

258
00:15:28,664 --> 00:15:30,882
behind the news will resonate for a long time.

259
00:15:31,103 --> 00:15:34,143
I hope to have the opportunity to lead our integrated media team,

260
00:15:34,223 --> 00:15:36,863
staying true to our initial aspirations and not letting time down.

261
00:15:45,944 --> 00:15:46,944
Shu Yi,

262
00:15:47,064 --> 00:15:48,762
it's been a long time.

263
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,162
Yes, sir.

264
00:15:50,422 --> 00:15:52,322
I heard something about you before.

265
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:54,382
They say you obtained

266
00:15:54,584 --> 00:15:58,249
such rich resources and opportunities through your boyfriend.

267
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:02,089
Journalists are supposed to have various resources

268
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,762
to meet the needs of their work.

269
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:06,223
It's true that my boyfriend, Shi Yan,

270
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:07,503
is outstanding.

271
00:16:07,598 --> 00:16:09,282
He is very supportive of my work too.

272
00:16:09,464 --> 00:16:11,922
So, he has indeed provided me with a lot of resources and assistance.

273
00:16:11,946 --> 00:16:14,882
However, my resources and opportunities are not limited to Shi Yan.

274
00:16:15,144 --> 00:16:16,882
In places unseen by everyone,

275
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:18,360
we mutually help each other.

276
00:16:20,663 --> 00:16:23,024
It's over? How did it go?

277
00:16:23,304 --> 00:16:25,202
It was okay, a stable performance.

278
00:16:26,503 --> 00:16:28,522
Buy us dinner!

279
00:16:28,603 --> 00:16:29,643
Okay.

280
00:16:29,744 --> 00:16:31,624
Tomorrow night, you guys pick the place.

281
00:16:33,064 --> 00:16:35,402
- Thank you, Shu Yi. - Thank you, Shu Yi.

282
00:16:42,266 --> 00:16:43,722
(I'm buying dinner tonight.)

283
00:16:43,814 --> 00:16:45,082
(Pick anywhere you want.)

284
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,184
(No need to hold back.)

285
00:16:49,104 --> 00:16:50,771
(How about Bogang Yunwan?)

286
00:16:53,695 --> 00:16:56,842
Okay. I will cook for you.

287
00:17:19,784 --> 00:17:21,613
Tell me, Ms. Yi.

288
00:17:28,224 --> 00:17:29,602
So, in the end,

289
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,802
the editor-in-chief didn't agree, didn't he?

290
00:17:35,224 --> 00:17:37,842
Shu Yi, he didn't disapprove of you.

291
00:17:38,064 --> 00:17:39,744
He just thinks you're too young

292
00:17:39,846 --> 00:17:41,276
and lack management experience.

293
00:17:43,064 --> 00:17:44,203
I understand.

294
00:17:46,384 --> 00:17:48,055
He praised you a lot today.

295
00:17:48,194 --> 00:17:49,965
It's just that he doesn't know you well enough.

296
00:17:49,989 --> 00:17:52,309
This important team is rather new for Financial Introduce.

297
00:17:52,544 --> 00:17:54,424
And to appoint such a young leader,

298
00:17:54,505 --> 00:17:56,414
he naturally has to consider it more.

299
00:17:57,297 --> 00:17:58,722
But he told me

300
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:01,253
he hasn't seen anyone better than you.

301
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:05,210
Shu Yi,

302
00:18:06,264 --> 00:18:08,482
actually, I have a selfish reason too.

303
00:18:08,842 --> 00:18:11,162
I hope you can spend a few more years on the front line,

304
00:18:11,482 --> 00:18:13,712
produce more good articles.

305
00:18:16,144 --> 00:18:17,402
I understand.

306
00:18:17,924 --> 00:18:19,602
If that's the reason,

307
00:18:19,829 --> 00:18:21,242
I fully accept it.

308
00:18:53,464 --> 00:18:54,682
Excuse me, sir.

309
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,242
Do you have WeChat?

310
00:18:57,814 --> 00:18:59,513
Why would you need his WeChat?

311
00:19:05,591 --> 00:19:07,402
I just want to send some money.

312
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:18,828
I'm miserable.

313
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,020
Since you're still thinking about adding other people on WeChat,

314
00:19:22,044 --> 00:19:23,514
you're not that miserable.

315
00:19:27,217 --> 00:19:29,487
Do you even know how to console someone?

316
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,980
(This is a public place.)

317
00:19:39,067 --> 00:19:41,181
(Has Shi Yan been possessed?)

318
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,785
What are you doing? People are watching.

319
00:19:53,664 --> 00:19:55,134
I thought you liked this?

320
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,463
I didn't make it as a team leader today.

321
00:19:58,543 --> 00:20:00,062
The editor-in-chief didn't approve.

322
00:20:04,144 --> 00:20:05,962
I have to refer your editor-in-chief

323
00:20:06,064 --> 00:20:07,882
to an ophthalmologist then.

324
00:20:09,443 --> 00:20:10,682
Go on then.

325
00:20:12,743 --> 00:20:14,682
Where are you going? Are you insane?

326
00:20:14,904 --> 00:20:16,575
Let's just go!

327
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:21,202
Where's the promised feast?

328
00:20:21,463 --> 00:20:23,122
There's still 104 dishes to go.

329
00:20:24,211 --> 00:20:25,761
Zheng Shu Yi.

330
00:20:27,463 --> 00:20:29,504
I'm so miserable.

331
00:20:29,584 --> 00:20:30,903
My promotion is blocked,

332
00:20:30,983 --> 00:20:32,584
and my boyfriend is being mean to me.

333
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:35,642
What's the point of living?

334
00:20:47,344 --> 00:20:49,082
What do you want now?

335
00:20:59,104 --> 00:21:02,663
This is the rare side of Shi Yan when Zheng Shu Yi is feeling down.

336
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:04,588
I don't know if I will ever see it again.

337
00:21:04,669 --> 00:21:05,887
I want to remember this.

338
00:21:27,924 --> 00:21:29,145
Are you still upset?

339
00:21:31,382 --> 00:21:32,602
All right.

340
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,408
Even though I didn't get promoted,

341
00:21:34,489 --> 00:21:36,322
I've taken care of Shi Yan.

342
00:21:36,544 --> 00:21:37,962
That's an achievement too.

343
00:21:39,224 --> 00:21:41,293
I'm not the only man you took care of.

344
00:21:42,757 --> 00:21:44,122
Shi Yan,

345
00:21:44,277 --> 00:21:46,242
why are you being so petty now?

346
00:21:47,184 --> 00:21:50,162
Yue Xing Zhou was fired for work negligence.

347
00:21:50,425 --> 00:21:52,922
Qin Le Zhi was also fired by Qiu Fu.

348
00:21:55,784 --> 00:21:57,682
I didn't expect the femme fatale

349
00:21:57,824 --> 00:21:59,124
to be myself.

350
00:22:04,104 --> 00:22:05,522
Why are you laughing?

351
00:22:07,023 --> 00:22:08,522
It's tickling!

352
00:22:16,024 --> 00:22:17,493
Shu Yi, come have breakfast.

353
00:22:17,661 --> 00:22:19,402
I'll skip it. I'm getting late.

354
00:22:23,984 --> 00:22:25,762
(Shu Yi, have you had breakfast?)

355
00:22:25,902 --> 00:22:27,160
(I bought some pan-fried buns for you.)

356
00:22:27,184 --> 00:22:28,535
(It's from that place on Xufu Road)

357
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,920
(that you said yesterday at noon, where you said there's a long queue.)

358
00:22:30,944 --> 00:22:33,605
Thank you, Qing Hua, but I've already had breakfast at home.

359
00:22:34,904 --> 00:22:37,922
(Shu Yi, do you know what Bei Er likes to eat?)

360
00:22:38,184 --> 00:22:39,802
(I can pick up something for her too.)

361
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:44,135
I haven't seen her having pan-fried buns for breakfast.

362
00:22:44,216 --> 00:22:46,420
She usually buys a cup of coffee every morning.

363
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:49,698
(Got it. Thanks, Shu Yi. I'll treat you to a meal another day.)

364
00:22:56,344 --> 00:22:57,602
Who was that?

365
00:22:59,743 --> 00:23:02,082
Our new integrated media editor.

366
00:23:03,857 --> 00:23:05,326
He sounded quite enthusiastic.

367
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,482
It doesn't matter to me.

368
00:23:07,923 --> 00:23:09,051
No matter how warm-hearted he is,

369
00:23:09,075 --> 00:23:11,298
it's nothing compared to the passionate love I have for my husband.

370
00:23:11,322 --> 00:23:13,422
My heart and eyes are filled with love for him.

371
00:23:14,304 --> 00:23:17,322
Besides, what he really wanted to ask about was Cheng Bei Er.

372
00:23:22,863 --> 00:23:24,755
- Where are you going? - I forgot something.

373
00:23:27,024 --> 00:23:28,164
Why are you taking that?

374
00:23:30,264 --> 00:23:31,584
My office feels a bit empty.

375
00:23:31,665 --> 00:23:33,082
So, I want to decorate it a bit.

376
00:23:33,504 --> 00:23:36,802
Should I put it on my desk or the meeting table?

377
00:23:37,037 --> 00:23:39,197
Or maybe I should just hang it outside my office door?

378
00:23:42,198 --> 00:23:43,482
Whatever you want.

379
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:46,642
I have to go.

380
00:23:46,897 --> 00:23:48,157
Stay safe.

381
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,962
Here's a sandwich for you.

382
00:23:51,089 --> 00:23:53,894
And here's a cup of coffee.

383
00:24:34,683 --> 00:24:35,842
Do you need a hand?

384
00:24:36,103 --> 00:24:37,282
It's fine.

385
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,482
Go sit down and rest. Dinner will be ready soon.

386
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:01,508
Is it really that good?

387
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:03,210
Do you still have room for dinner later?

388
00:25:03,784 --> 00:25:05,344
It's not the pan-fried bun that's good,

389
00:25:05,393 --> 00:25:06,722
it's my husband's thoughtfulness.

390
00:25:06,864 --> 00:25:08,464
Of course I can't waste any of it.

391
00:25:10,024 --> 00:25:11,842
You better finish every bit of the food later

392
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,040
because that's also your husband's thoughtfulness.

393
00:25:19,425 --> 00:25:25,049
(Bogang Yunwan)

394
00:25:54,664 --> 00:25:56,202
It's snowing.

395
00:25:56,973 --> 00:25:58,362
It's snowing?

396
00:26:07,704 --> 00:26:09,402
It's the first snow.

397
00:26:13,037 --> 00:26:14,667
Do you really like snow that much?

398
00:26:15,822 --> 00:26:17,001
Haven't you heard?

399
00:26:17,087 --> 00:26:19,190
It's said that people who are together on the day of the first snow

400
00:26:19,214 --> 00:26:20,922
will love each other forever.

401
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,642
We can be together forever then.

402
00:27:34,141 --> 00:27:35,141
Yue,

403
00:27:35,329 --> 00:27:36,369
follow up on this.

404
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:37,572
Got it, Shu Yi.

405
00:27:38,784 --> 00:27:40,455
Do it now.

406
00:27:53,757 --> 00:27:55,362
I've been hired!

407
00:27:55,687 --> 00:27:57,842
Congratulations, Yue. You've been hired.

408
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:01,002
I hope you continue to work harder and be a great financial journalist.

409
00:28:01,104 --> 00:28:02,184
I will!

410
00:28:07,067 --> 00:28:10,226
Bruce didn't really part on good terms when he left Le'an before.

411
00:28:10,344 --> 00:28:11,882
I was worried working together again,

412
00:28:11,976 --> 00:28:14,083
things would get awkward between them,

413
00:28:14,164 --> 00:28:16,509
but surprisingly, things are progressing smoothly.

414
00:28:17,144 --> 00:28:18,864
Their goals are actually aligned.

415
00:28:19,177 --> 00:28:22,122
In terms of technology, they appreciate each other.

416
00:28:22,216 --> 00:28:23,816
There is a foundation for collaboration.

417
00:28:23,904 --> 00:28:26,362
I have to admit your judgment is still accurate.

418
00:28:26,544 --> 00:28:27,544
Here.

419
00:28:28,384 --> 00:28:30,122
So, this was within your plan again, huh?

420
00:28:30,344 --> 00:28:31,344
Cheers.

421
00:28:33,857 --> 00:28:35,076
I'll go get the door.

422
00:28:39,424 --> 00:28:40,424
Coming.

423
00:28:43,716 --> 00:28:44,716
Yu You!

424
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:46,824
Yue...

425
00:28:48,424 --> 00:28:49,645
I'm so happy!

426
00:28:52,584 --> 00:28:54,802
Why don't you ask me what happened?

427
00:28:56,624 --> 00:28:58,842
I got hired today.

428
00:28:59,064 --> 00:29:02,503
Moreover, my first digital magazine front-page proposal got approved!

429
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:03,842
Really?

430
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:08,762
Think of a reward for me now.

431
00:29:20,664 --> 00:29:22,042
Qin Shi Yue.

432
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:49,410
It's okay.

433
00:29:56,104 --> 00:29:57,773
Call me Uncle now.

434
00:30:05,864 --> 00:30:07,659
(According to the latest report by Financial Introduce, )

435
00:30:07,683 --> 00:30:09,843
(recently, Le'an Technology and Dark Horse Technology)

436
00:30:09,984 --> 00:30:13,244
(have made significant breakthroughs in the mmWave chips field.)

437
00:30:13,325 --> 00:30:14,400
(This breakthrough is likely)

438
00:30:14,424 --> 00:30:17,122
(to propel domestically produced chips to new heights.)

439
00:30:33,974 --> 00:30:36,373
With the acceleration of the aging,

440
00:30:36,454 --> 00:30:39,602
elderly care has become a problem that everyone must face.

441
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:41,623
Faced with a vast market,

442
00:30:41,704 --> 00:30:43,440
major financial players are entering the field,

443
00:30:43,464 --> 00:30:45,202
making the competition more intense.

444
00:30:45,417 --> 00:30:47,200
Through in-depth research and a focus on people's livelihoods,

445
00:30:47,224 --> 00:30:50,249
she delves into and expresses concern about this issue,

446
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:52,090
discussing the future of smart elderly care.

447
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:53,773
This showcases the social responsibility

448
00:30:53,797 --> 00:30:55,722
of a new generation of media professionals.

449
00:31:00,869 --> 00:31:03,282
The award-winning work for the 10th Financial News Awards'

450
00:31:03,386 --> 00:31:05,882
Annual Industry Reporting is

451
00:31:06,024 --> 00:31:08,672
"Where is the Path in the Elderly Care"

452
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:12,662
The recipient is Zheng Shu Yi, a journalist from Financial Introduce.

453
00:31:34,909 --> 00:31:36,162
Thank you, everyone.

454
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:54,282
Hello, everyone.

455
00:31:54,424 --> 00:31:57,202
First of all, thank you all for coming.

456
00:31:57,464 --> 00:32:00,303
All of you who are present today are all good friends

457
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:02,299
who have helped and accompanied Le'an along the way

458
00:32:02,323 --> 00:32:03,922
to where we are today.

459
00:32:04,504 --> 00:32:06,235
I'm not very good with words,

460
00:32:06,316 --> 00:32:08,082
so let me bow to everyone first.

461
00:32:13,944 --> 00:32:14,944
In the blink of an eye,

462
00:32:15,089 --> 00:32:17,882
Le'an Technology has been established for seven years.

463
00:32:18,024 --> 00:32:19,202
Along this journey,

464
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,682
there have been difficulties,

465
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:24,082
but for me, there's been even more to gain.

466
00:32:28,927 --> 00:32:30,962
Mr. Shi, you've got a good eye.

467
00:32:31,864 --> 00:32:34,244
I've always got a good eye.

468
00:32:35,449 --> 00:32:37,842
People often talk about the "seven-year itch,"

469
00:32:37,984 --> 00:32:39,522
but I assure you

470
00:32:39,744 --> 00:32:42,142
that Le'an will continue

471
00:32:42,223 --> 00:32:44,224
to forge ahead as usual

472
00:32:44,342 --> 00:32:45,682
on our seventh anniversary.

473
00:32:45,855 --> 00:32:46,929
So today,

474
00:32:47,024 --> 00:32:48,843
I want to share some good news with everyone.

475
00:32:49,023 --> 00:32:50,602
What good news?

476
00:32:50,743 --> 00:32:52,362
What good news?

477
00:32:52,703 --> 00:32:54,202
Le'an will be going

478
00:32:54,503 --> 00:32:56,282
for an initial public offering.

479
00:32:56,393 --> 00:32:57,842
Awesome!

480
00:33:03,777 --> 00:33:05,202
I'd like

481
00:33:05,615 --> 00:33:07,482
to express special thanks to someone

482
00:33:07,697 --> 00:33:09,246
in front of everyone here.

483
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:11,863
Someone who is very, very,

484
00:33:11,991 --> 00:33:15,011
very important to me and Le'an.

485
00:33:15,724 --> 00:33:17,322
If it weren't for him,

486
00:33:17,703 --> 00:33:19,383
there wouldn't be the Le'an we have today.

487
00:33:22,344 --> 00:33:23,344
Mr. Shi,

488
00:33:23,756 --> 00:33:24,756
thank you.

489
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:27,583
Thank you for extending a helping hand to Le'an

490
00:33:27,687 --> 00:33:30,402
when it was most difficult, most in need of help,

491
00:33:31,224 --> 00:33:34,551
and for providing full support to Le'an.

492
00:33:37,969 --> 00:33:42,783
Now, let's invite Mr. Shi to the stage to say a few words, okay?

493
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:44,482
Yes!

494
00:33:51,944 --> 00:33:54,082
I'm very happy about Le'an's achievements today.

495
00:33:54,586 --> 00:33:56,934
Le'an's success is also Yunchuang's success.

496
00:33:57,266 --> 00:33:59,802
Going public for the first time is a new beginning for Le'an,

497
00:33:59,944 --> 00:34:02,322
and it holds significant meaning for Yunchuang as well.

498
00:34:02,503 --> 00:34:06,082
In the future, I hope Mr. Chen can lead Le'an even further

499
00:34:06,306 --> 00:34:08,122
and create our own chip.

500
00:34:08,309 --> 00:34:09,442
Thank you.

501
00:34:09,689 --> 00:34:11,694
Well said!

502
00:34:30,783 --> 00:34:31,962
Have some desserts.

503
00:34:36,224 --> 00:34:37,224
Here.

504
00:34:40,104 --> 00:34:41,402
What are you doing?

505
00:34:41,798 --> 00:34:43,960
I'm serving you.

506
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:48,983
If you had been this sweet earlier,

507
00:34:49,064 --> 00:34:51,082
we would have children already.

508
00:35:04,247 --> 00:35:05,305
What is this?

509
00:35:05,402 --> 00:35:06,544
What do you think?

510
00:35:12,064 --> 00:35:13,064
Miss Zheng,

511
00:35:13,749 --> 00:35:15,762
you've been promoted.

512
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,794
When do you plan to promote me too?

513
00:35:26,796 --> 00:35:28,322
Where's your job performance report?

514
00:35:33,584 --> 00:35:35,254
I can't believe you're staying silent.

515
00:35:37,941 --> 00:35:39,162
You're in trouble.

516
00:35:41,591 --> 00:35:42,591
Shu Yi?

517
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:49,104
Shu Yi?

518
00:35:50,344 --> 00:35:52,242
Who are you, sir?

519
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:55,362
Please don't hit on me.

520
00:35:57,064 --> 00:35:58,454
I have a husband.

521
00:36:08,864 --> 00:36:10,682
That's pretty much it for next quarter.

522
00:36:10,802 --> 00:36:12,522
If there's nothing else, I'll go out first.

523
00:36:12,624 --> 00:36:13,664
Shu Yi.

524
00:36:15,902 --> 00:36:17,122
Please stay for a minute.

525
00:36:25,142 --> 00:36:26,482
Who's getting married?

526
00:36:29,024 --> 00:36:30,362
It seems hard for you to tell me.

527
00:36:30,511 --> 00:36:32,020
Don't tell me it's Xu Yu Ling.

528
00:36:34,669 --> 00:36:35,922
It's me.

529
00:36:44,144 --> 00:36:46,482
I'd like to ask you to be my maid of honor.

530
00:36:47,143 --> 00:36:48,434
Guan Xiang Cheng?

531
00:36:48,712 --> 00:36:51,802
It's not the Uncle Guan I know, is it?

532
00:36:54,742 --> 00:36:56,642
Since when did you guys...

533
00:36:57,295 --> 00:36:58,642
It's been a long time.

534
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:01,162
Are you guys from Secrecy Bureau?

535
00:37:02,344 --> 00:37:03,545
No way, I don't care.

536
00:37:03,626 --> 00:37:05,602
You have to tell me everything.

537
00:37:05,749 --> 00:37:07,629
Otherwise, I won't be able to focus on my work.

538
00:37:09,784 --> 00:37:11,682
We've known each other for a long time.

539
00:37:12,376 --> 00:37:14,184
In my third year of work,

540
00:37:14,569 --> 00:37:16,882
I had the opportunity to interview him and Shi Wen Guang.

541
00:39:33,306 --> 00:39:36,162
(Groom: Guan Xiang Cheng & Bride: Tang Yi)

542
00:39:37,344 --> 00:39:39,064
- Thank you, everyone. - Congratulations.

543
00:39:39,103 --> 00:39:40,543
- Okay, thank you. - Thank you.

544
00:39:40,623 --> 00:39:42,042
Thank you.

545
00:39:46,436 --> 00:39:48,470
- Enjoy, everyone. - Enjoy.

546
00:39:48,551 --> 00:39:50,220
- Enjoy the food. - Enjoy.

547
00:39:50,301 --> 00:39:52,389
- Enjoy your drinks. - Pour me some drinks, Shi Yan.

548
00:39:52,413 --> 00:39:53,684
Go easy on the drinks.

549
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,919
That's enough.

550
00:39:55,024 --> 00:39:56,202
Here, Uncle Guan.

551
00:39:56,824 --> 00:39:58,402
Don't pour too much for him.

552
00:39:58,744 --> 00:39:59,962
Have some more.

553
00:40:00,442 --> 00:40:02,762
Ms. Yi, Uncle Guan, I wish you...

554
00:40:04,429 --> 00:40:06,722
It's time for a test, Miss Qin.

555
00:40:07,064 --> 00:40:08,695
Choose your words wisely, or Uncle Guan might not

556
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:10,882
let you go horseback riding at his ranch anymore.

557
00:40:12,986 --> 00:40:14,903
Ms. Yi, I wish you and your husband

558
00:40:14,987 --> 00:40:16,507
a happy marriage, everlasting harmony,

559
00:40:16,592 --> 00:40:17,882
may you grow old together,

560
00:40:17,986 --> 00:40:19,826
I wish you a life of bliss, and sweet moments.

561
00:40:20,704 --> 00:40:22,442
I hope your wishes come true.

562
00:40:22,542 --> 00:40:24,922
I would like to get younger

563
00:40:25,046 --> 00:40:26,482
and take good care of Tang Yi.

564
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:27,670
Here.

565
00:40:30,066 --> 00:40:32,320
Since you've delivered all our blessings, what do we have left to say?

566
00:40:32,344 --> 00:40:33,704
Here, congratulations.

567
00:40:33,784 --> 00:40:34,864
Congratulations.

568
00:40:34,944 --> 00:40:36,362
Thank you.

569
00:40:36,638 --> 00:40:38,038
Cheers.

570
00:40:40,547 --> 00:40:42,606
Sit down and drink. Don't stand.

571
00:40:45,956 --> 00:40:48,522
Yue, since you've taken care of our wishes,

572
00:40:48,704 --> 00:40:50,402
why not help us finish the wine too?

573
00:40:51,348 --> 00:40:52,965
I can drink for her,

574
00:40:53,127 --> 00:40:54,343
but aren't we the Three Musketeers

575
00:40:54,367 --> 00:40:56,162
supposed share both blessings and challenges?

576
00:40:56,186 --> 00:40:57,769
Here, Uncle Guan, congratulations.

577
00:40:57,850 --> 00:40:58,903
Cheers.

578
00:40:59,014 --> 00:41:00,402
Bottoms up.

579
00:41:02,224 --> 00:41:03,402
I have a question.

580
00:41:03,584 --> 00:41:05,524
Xiao Ming, what's your question?

581
00:41:06,396 --> 00:41:08,682
You see, even Xiang Cheng is married for the second time.

582
00:41:08,906 --> 00:41:11,362
What about Guan Ji here?

583
00:41:12,464 --> 00:41:13,802
When is his turn?

584
00:41:17,731 --> 00:41:19,122
I'm ready,

585
00:41:19,889 --> 00:41:22,882
but this still depends on the leading lady.

586
00:41:25,584 --> 00:41:28,122
I'm always in sync with Shu Yi,

587
00:41:28,266 --> 00:41:29,682
and I'm ready anytime.

588
00:41:29,784 --> 00:41:31,627
But, I can't leave her behind.

589
00:41:31,708 --> 00:41:33,482
So, I'd like to ask Mr. Shi,

590
00:41:33,686 --> 00:41:36,546
when do you plan to marry Shu Yi?

591
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:41,930
Shu Yi, think about it

592
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:43,642
and pick a date you like.

593
00:41:47,037 --> 00:41:50,122
Yu You is the oldest among the Three Musketeers, right?

594
00:41:50,213 --> 00:41:51,773
You should set an example.

595
00:41:55,149 --> 00:41:57,522
It's true that I'm at the age where I should settle down.

596
00:41:57,704 --> 00:41:58,904
But it depends on

597
00:41:58,989 --> 00:42:01,834
when the elders are willing to let Yue marry me.

598
00:42:02,184 --> 00:42:03,223
That's right.

599
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:05,482
What if my dad is reluctant to let Yue go?

600
00:42:05,746 --> 00:42:06,964
Grandpa wouldn't do that.

601
00:42:07,045 --> 00:42:08,842
He even urged me to get married before.

602
00:42:11,224 --> 00:42:12,682
She's eager to get married now.

603
00:42:13,344 --> 00:42:14,344
Yu You,

604
00:42:14,557 --> 00:42:16,602
we don't accept returns.

605
00:42:16,823 --> 00:42:18,375
Dad, what are you talking about?

606
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:20,642
How about

607
00:42:20,824 --> 00:42:23,242
you Three Musketeers get married together?

608
00:42:23,384 --> 00:42:26,602
A group wedding would be lively and fun, wouldn't it?

609
00:42:26,704 --> 00:42:28,042
This is a good idea.

610
00:42:31,728 --> 00:42:33,205
We're not in a hurry.

611
00:42:33,307 --> 00:42:36,303
We still need to progress in our careers.

612
00:42:36,384 --> 00:42:37,623
Make breakthroughs.

613
00:42:37,704 --> 00:42:39,482
In short, we aim to reach new heights.

614
00:42:43,414 --> 00:42:44,882
Since that's the case,

615
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,922
let's leave it to fate.

616
00:42:54,673 --> 00:42:55,973
Leave it to fate.

617
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:57,379
I'll drink to you alone.

618
00:42:57,494 --> 00:43:00,322
Don't stand, my old friend.

619
00:43:01,784 --> 00:43:04,413
Shu Yi, look at that bouquet. It's pretty.

620
00:43:06,103 --> 00:43:08,242
But the flowers you bought yesterday are still fresh.

621
00:43:09,144 --> 00:43:11,133
If you manage to catch that bouquet...

622
00:43:12,216 --> 00:43:13,482
What are you going to do then?

623
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,162
Shan Shan,

624
00:43:23,424 --> 00:43:24,682
this is my dad's wedding.

625
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,442
You have to catch that bouquet.

626
00:43:27,245 --> 00:43:29,002
It's out of my control.

627
00:43:31,024 --> 00:43:32,442
I will catch it for you then.

628
00:43:35,644 --> 00:43:38,842
Yu You, do you want me to catch the bouquet?

629
00:43:40,369 --> 00:43:41,536
Let's leave it to fate.

630
00:43:41,656 --> 00:43:44,896
If you catch it, we'll speed things up.

631
00:43:45,186 --> 00:43:46,544
If not,

632
00:43:46,625 --> 00:43:49,886
I'll still prioritize and plan it properly.

633
00:43:59,415 --> 00:44:03,085
- Are you ready? - Yes!
