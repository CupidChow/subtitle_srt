1
00:01:31,122 --> 00:01:36,122
(Only For Love)

2
00:01:36,203 --> 00:01:39,002
(Episode 21)

3
00:02:00,669 --> 00:02:03,158
Drinking alone might be a bit boring.

4
00:02:03,324 --> 00:02:06,121
Do you know how to play the finger-guessing game? Let's play it.

5
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,420
I don't know.

6
00:02:12,562 --> 00:02:14,171
But you can teach me.

7
00:02:15,876 --> 00:02:17,442
Okay, I'll teach you.

8
00:02:38,073 --> 00:02:39,282
Come again.

9
00:02:39,608 --> 00:02:41,649
We can't play anymore. You're drunk.

10
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,220
I'm not drunk.

11
00:02:46,215 --> 00:02:48,328
Shi Yan, you're quite good.

12
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:50,402
You haven't lost a single round.

13
00:02:54,873 --> 00:02:56,273
I'm not good.

14
00:02:57,543 --> 00:02:59,233
I failed miserably today.

15
00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:04,069
Shi Yan.

16
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:08,358
Bruce's leaving caught me off guard.

17
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,190
We weren't prepared at all.

18
00:03:11,789 --> 00:03:15,359
I paid a huge price to invite him to join Le'an Technology.

19
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,840
I just didn't expect that

20
00:03:19,308 --> 00:03:22,347
there's someone more excellent and capable than me.

21
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,641
No, he's not as great as you.

22
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:33,959
Only you would think so.

23
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,791
No.

24
00:03:41,309 --> 00:03:44,692
Today, the directors asked me why Bruce left.

25
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,199
What are the upcoming plans for Le'an Technology?

26
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,411
What are the plans for Yunchuang?

27
00:03:51,839 --> 00:03:53,249
I couldn't answer.

28
00:03:54,548 --> 00:03:57,437
I don't even know how all this happened.

29
00:04:03,547 --> 00:04:05,598
It's not your problem.

30
00:04:06,974 --> 00:04:09,162
You're just an investor.

31
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,660
Whether Bruce stays or leaves, and Le'an Technology's problem,

32
00:04:13,154 --> 00:04:15,394
aren't something you can solve alone.

33
00:04:16,901 --> 00:04:19,072
What about Chen Kang? What did Chen Kang say?

34
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:23,039
Chen Kang just found out about this too.

35
00:04:23,535 --> 00:04:25,945
Bruce compensated for all the economic losses.

36
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:29,479
The previous research results have also been retained in Le'an Technology.

37
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:31,919
It's just that after this...

38
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,470
Chen Kang doesn't know what to do next.

39
00:04:46,475 --> 00:04:48,405
Let me tell you a secret.

40
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,090
When I was an intern,

41
00:04:51,179 --> 00:04:54,710
I had an article that I had to endlessly revise.

42
00:04:55,339 --> 00:04:59,778
I revised it back and forth 27 times and finally it got approved.

43
00:05:00,764 --> 00:05:02,175
And guess what?

44
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:06,254
The article was shelved and not published.

45
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:09,050
At that time,

46
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:10,778
I didn't know what to do.

47
00:05:11,012 --> 00:05:12,621
No one could help me.

48
00:05:13,226 --> 00:05:17,716
I wasn't even sure if I could become a journalist.

49
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:19,799
I was so lost that I forgot to cry.

50
00:05:24,266 --> 00:05:26,157
Why don't you ask me what happened next?

51
00:05:27,762 --> 00:05:29,162
What happened?

52
00:05:31,017 --> 00:05:32,138
Then I thought,

53
00:05:32,241 --> 00:05:35,362
it would be too embarrassing if I were knocked down after just one try.

54
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,762
My article wasn't published this time.

55
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,358
Then, I'll write a good one for the next issue.

56
00:05:39,543 --> 00:05:41,183
Then the one after that, I'll make it to the front page.

57
00:05:41,266 --> 00:05:43,413
The article for the front page can't possibly be shelved, right?

58
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:48,587
And in my first year of internship, I really got the front page.

59
00:05:49,045 --> 00:05:51,655
I was the first intern to get the front page.

60
00:05:57,109 --> 00:05:58,509
Shi Yan.

61
00:05:59,543 --> 00:06:02,433
Who has not encountered setbacks?

62
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,410
Those who haven't faced setbacks won't succeed.

63
00:06:06,764 --> 00:06:11,175
Your legs are so long, there's no obstacle you can't get through.

64
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:15,202
When I was working on the special coverage for Yunchuang,

65
00:06:15,283 --> 00:06:16,962
I kept thinking,

66
00:06:17,308 --> 00:06:19,918
Shi Yan is so incredible.

67
00:06:20,093 --> 00:06:23,693
He's smart, ambitious and responsible.

68
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,424
If he doesn't succeed, who will?

69
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:32,938
- Shu Yi.   - Search online for the word "difficulty".

70
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:34,239
And then search for "solution".

71
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,602
You'll find that there are always more solutions than difficulties.

72
00:06:37,915 --> 00:06:39,122
I...

73
00:06:40,355 --> 00:06:41,479
So...

74
00:06:41,951 --> 00:06:43,202
Shi Yan.

75
00:06:43,876 --> 00:06:45,242
You can do it.

76
00:06:45,652 --> 00:06:49,078
You founded Yunchuang and led it to where it is today.

77
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:52,559
You're so awesome. You have to believe in yourself.

78
00:06:54,362 --> 00:06:57,002
- Zheng Shu Yi.   - Let me finish.

79
00:07:00,175 --> 00:07:01,575
Now, you

80
00:07:02,574 --> 00:07:03,803
have me,

81
00:07:04,453 --> 00:07:05,933
Guan Ji,

82
00:07:06,086 --> 00:07:07,442
Yu You,

83
00:07:08,002 --> 00:07:09,322
Chen Sheng,

84
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,634
and me...

85
00:07:12,359 --> 00:07:14,239
And Guan Ji.

86
00:07:14,924 --> 00:07:16,162
And also...

87
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:18,522
Think about me.

88
00:07:18,603 --> 00:07:20,003
Don't always think about difficulties.

89
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,200
Zheng Shu Yi, be quiet.

90
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:27,449
Okay, tell me what you want to say.

91
00:07:28,835 --> 00:07:30,235
I want to kiss you.

92
00:07:59,456 --> 00:08:00,856
Morning, Mr. Shi.

93
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:06,600
(Morning, Shi Yan.)

94
00:08:06,738 --> 00:08:10,147
(Bruce has made up his mind. It's not possible to salvage the situation.)

95
00:08:11,246 --> 00:08:12,405
It's expected.

96
00:08:12,486 --> 00:08:14,966
The most urgent thing now is to think of a remedy as soon as possible.

97
00:08:15,059 --> 00:08:18,390
I will have a meeting with Le'an today, and I'll discuss it with Chen Kang.

98
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:45,722
(Morning.)

99
00:08:46,387 --> 00:08:47,917
He's up so early.

100
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:53,841
It's tough for my CEO. He has to work even on weekends.

101
00:08:55,729 --> 00:09:00,020
(Morning. Your sweetheart suddenly appeared.)

102
00:09:03,574 --> 00:09:06,866
If I work overtime at his company, I can't dress too flashy.

103
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,637
But Shi Yan likes the color red.

104
00:09:11,748 --> 00:09:13,032
But...

105
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:15,720
Shi Yan can't be really asking me to work, right?

106
00:09:16,678 --> 00:09:18,288
He just wants to be with me.

107
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,489
(Qin Shi Yue)

108
00:09:28,363 --> 00:09:29,562
Oh, no.

109
00:09:30,094 --> 00:09:32,744
I forgot I asked Yu You and Yue to go to the art gallery today.

110
00:09:35,189 --> 00:09:36,457
(Shu Yi, are you up?)

111
00:09:36,538 --> 00:09:38,002
(I'm totally ready.)

112
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:39,442
(Should we depart now?)

113
00:09:39,551 --> 00:09:41,042
- (Do you want me to pick you up?)   - No need.

114
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:43,682
I'm ready. I'm leaving now.

115
00:09:43,902 --> 00:09:45,999
(Okay, see you later. Bye.)

116
00:09:46,196 --> 00:09:47,368
Bye.

117
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,676
(I'll go to the art gallery with Shi Yue and Yu You first, )

118
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:58,059
(then go to Yunchuang to work overtime with you.)

119
00:10:09,123 --> 00:10:11,700
A bit of jealousy can delight the mood,

120
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,999
but overjealous will make you sad and is harmful to your health.

121
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,082
For your sake, I won't tell you.

122
00:10:16,484 --> 00:10:19,124
I'll finish the fight quickly and go to you.

123
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:30,890
Shu Yi, look.

124
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,325
Those who focus on academics are different.

125
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,150
He's so cultured.

126
00:10:36,817 --> 00:10:38,628
Unlike my uncle.

127
00:10:40,245 --> 00:10:43,014
(My uncle seems to be pretty good too.)

128
00:10:43,766 --> 00:10:45,631
Unlike my uncle.

129
00:10:45,725 --> 00:10:46,980
He has comprehensive development of morality,

130
00:10:47,061 --> 00:10:48,562
intelligence, physique, and art.

131
00:10:50,914 --> 00:10:53,642
No matter how much you praise him here, he won't hear it.

132
00:10:57,136 --> 00:10:59,065
Did you not sleep well last night?

133
00:10:59,688 --> 00:11:02,647
No way. I applied three layers of concealer and still couldn't cover it?

134
00:11:02,774 --> 00:11:06,541
No, I can only see a little bit if I look closely.

135
00:11:07,725 --> 00:11:09,046
That's good.

136
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,525
- Let's go.   - Let's go.

137
00:11:11,725 --> 00:11:12,962
Professor Yu.

138
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:15,060
You're here.

139
00:11:15,158 --> 00:11:16,998
Professor Yu, have you waited for a long time?

140
00:11:17,138 --> 00:11:18,762
No, I just arrived too.

141
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:20,242
That's good.

142
00:11:20,829 --> 00:11:22,319
Let's go in.

143
00:11:28,363 --> 00:11:29,482
Hello.

144
00:11:34,934 --> 00:11:36,170
Shu Yi.

145
00:11:36,465 --> 00:11:38,555
Raphael, do you know him?

146
00:11:39,668 --> 00:11:41,845
Then later, leave the space for me to perform.

147
00:11:41,957 --> 00:11:43,091
I'm professional.

148
00:11:43,172 --> 00:11:44,572
That's great.

149
00:11:57,365 --> 00:12:00,842
Raphael's study and transformation of Da Vinci's works

150
00:12:00,923 --> 00:12:03,162
have brought him tremendous success.

151
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:07,656
The refined features and dynamic brushwork he distilled

152
00:12:07,845 --> 00:12:09,654
weakened the contrast of light and shadow,

153
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:14,241
creating a noble, serene and clear realistic art.

154
00:12:22,725 --> 00:12:24,405
You're good, Yue.

155
00:12:24,596 --> 00:12:27,162
I didn't know you have some artistic cultivation.

156
00:12:27,433 --> 00:12:29,122
I'm not good at all.

157
00:12:30,032 --> 00:12:33,642
I've been memorizing information from Baidu Baike these past few nights.

158
00:12:35,176 --> 00:12:38,162
As soon as I saw these paintings, I forgot everything.

159
00:12:38,437 --> 00:12:41,567
I'm just putting together random things. I don't even know what I'm saying.

160
00:12:42,927 --> 00:12:46,566
But Professor Yu was deceived by me just like you.

161
00:12:46,669 --> 00:12:48,069
That's enough.

162
00:12:53,718 --> 00:12:58,808
Raphael is best known for his images of the Virgin he painted.

163
00:12:59,295 --> 00:13:03,787
She looks dignified, elegant, with beautiful and gentle lines.

164
00:13:04,287 --> 00:13:09,498
The women in his paintings are beautiful, gentle and vivid.

165
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,970
(Yi, how's the exhibition with Professor Yu?)

166
00:13:23,842 --> 00:13:26,042
(You must be enjoying the exhibition with Yu You.)

167
00:13:26,247 --> 00:13:27,802
(I won't disturb you.)

168
00:13:27,925 --> 00:13:30,416
(We have an event at the academy this afternoon.)

169
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,045
Shi Yue?

170
00:13:56,823 --> 00:13:57,872
Who is this?

171
00:13:58,483 --> 00:13:59,602
His mother.

172
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,642
It's fine.

173
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:14,522
His mother is the dean of the art academy,

174
00:14:14,642 --> 00:14:16,562
but that doesn't mean he understands art.

175
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:20,696
Are you comforting me?

176
00:14:22,274 --> 00:14:23,522
Of course.

177
00:14:23,627 --> 00:14:26,962
You see, your dad and your uncle both know finance.

178
00:14:27,016 --> 00:14:28,664
But you also don't know a thing about it, right?

179
00:14:34,022 --> 00:14:35,682
Thank you, Shu Yi.

180
00:16:33,878 --> 00:16:35,002
Guan Ji,

181
00:16:35,438 --> 00:16:36,838
you won again.

182
00:16:37,445 --> 00:16:39,935
As usual, let's go have a drink after this.

183
00:16:40,405 --> 00:16:42,015
Call Yao Yao and Meng Meng to join us.

184
00:16:43,645 --> 00:16:45,045
You guys go ahead.

185
00:16:45,194 --> 00:16:46,474
I won't join you today.

186
00:16:46,555 --> 00:16:48,522
Guan Ji, what's going on with you?

187
00:16:48,668 --> 00:16:50,282
We've been having a hard time asking you out.

188
00:16:50,363 --> 00:16:52,893
Have you switched to a more virtuous lifestyle and quit playing?

189
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,525
Let's go then.

190
00:16:57,079 --> 00:16:58,202
Let's go.

191
00:17:07,885 --> 00:17:10,215
We're almost done. I have to go back and work overtime.

192
00:17:10,573 --> 00:17:11,772
Work overtime?

193
00:17:11,845 --> 00:17:13,696
Shu Yi, do you have to work overtime today?

194
00:17:14,374 --> 00:17:18,704
(Yue, you don't really have to pry that much about certain things.)

195
00:17:19,974 --> 00:17:21,094
It's okay. I'll give you a ride.

196
00:17:21,245 --> 00:17:22,277
No need.

197
00:17:22,358 --> 00:17:24,042
My cab is already here.

198
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,639
Goodbye.

199
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,922
Be safe.

200
00:17:30,038 --> 00:17:32,175
(How to make him stay?)

201
00:17:32,268 --> 00:17:35,264
(We're finally having some time alone. I can't let him leave.)

202
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:38,682
(Eat? Shop? Watch a movie?)

203
00:17:44,044 --> 00:17:45,191
Miss Qin...

204
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:48,674
When I bought tickets for the art exhibition, I also got two movie tickets.

205
00:17:48,755 --> 00:17:51,455
It's an art film. Let's watch it together.

206
00:17:52,737 --> 00:17:54,347
Shouldn't it be three tickets?

207
00:18:03,329 --> 00:18:04,642
Right.

208
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,857
How come there's only two movie tickets?

209
00:18:12,834 --> 00:18:14,234
I have some time later.

210
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:20,165
That's great!

211
00:18:36,885 --> 00:18:38,735
(Is the report for Juhe ready?)

212
00:18:54,408 --> 00:18:55,642
(Today is the weekend.)

213
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:57,416
(You're single and so you can work overtime.)

214
00:18:57,498 --> 00:18:58,948
(But Yu You is a normal person.)

215
00:18:59,029 --> 00:19:01,278
(He might be on a date or meeting someone.)

216
00:19:23,915 --> 00:19:25,485
(Who are you going to the exhibition with?)

217
00:19:28,685 --> 00:19:30,374
(Me, my leader, )

218
00:19:30,847 --> 00:19:34,096
(and her friend.)

219
00:19:41,443 --> 00:19:42,843
(What friend?)

220
00:19:45,086 --> 00:19:47,202
(The blind date from last time.)

221
00:20:10,199 --> 00:20:13,210
It seems it's too late to go back and change clothes now.

222
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:23,492
(Didn't you promise to work overtime with me?)

223
00:20:23,573 --> 00:20:25,062
(Are you working remotely?)

224
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:27,728
(I'm here.)

225
00:20:32,886 --> 00:20:36,562
(I didn't expect to spend my weekend working overtime with you.)

226
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,511
(Are you a little touched?)

227
00:20:38,592 --> 00:20:39,992
(Sorry.)

228
00:20:40,185 --> 00:20:42,224
(Go to the eighth floor to get documents from Mr. Qiu first, )

229
00:20:42,313 --> 00:20:43,832
(and then come to the 12th floor.)

230
00:20:45,885 --> 00:20:47,552
He's really treating me like an errand girl.

231
00:20:47,651 --> 00:20:49,051
Don't you have a secretary?

232
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,241
Wait a second!

233
00:21:28,081 --> 00:21:30,122
(You thought? You figured?)

234
00:21:30,232 --> 00:21:32,351
Can you understand your position?

235
00:21:32,432 --> 00:21:34,082
You don't even know who is important or not,

236
00:21:34,163 --> 00:21:35,242
yet you simply changed my schedule!

237
00:21:35,323 --> 00:21:37,120
Is Zheng Shu Yi an ordinary journalist?

238
00:21:37,224 --> 00:21:38,682
Do you know who she is?

239
00:21:38,748 --> 00:21:40,489
Is this as simple as you thought?

240
00:21:50,044 --> 00:21:51,122
Miss Zheng.

241
00:21:51,365 --> 00:21:54,765
I don't know why you come to our company on a weekend,

242
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,640
but I want to remind you.

243
00:21:57,015 --> 00:22:00,504
Mr. Qiu's wife is the deputy manager of a self-media operation company.

244
00:22:01,036 --> 00:22:04,126
If any infidelity were to happen in her marriage,

245
00:22:04,763 --> 00:22:06,163
with her abilities,

246
00:22:06,286 --> 00:22:10,736
she can make it a public scandal with just a word.

247
00:22:13,024 --> 00:22:14,962
You're reminding me?

248
00:22:17,148 --> 00:22:19,478
Why? Have you turned over a new leaf?

249
00:22:40,503 --> 00:22:44,042
Miss Zheng, this is public information that you can refer to.

250
00:22:44,149 --> 00:22:46,802
If it's not enough, I'll have someone prepare more for you later.

251
00:22:49,529 --> 00:22:51,682
These are enough.

252
00:23:22,646 --> 00:23:25,002
(His mom is the dean of an art academy.)

253
00:23:25,185 --> 00:23:28,245
(He must have grown up under the influence of art.)

254
00:23:28,342 --> 00:23:31,506
(Even so, he didn't expose my nonsense.)

255
00:23:31,709 --> 00:23:34,402
(He even accompanied me to watch such a boring art film.)

256
00:23:34,765 --> 00:23:36,695
(Then, perhaps)

257
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,882
(Yu You has feelings for me too, right?)

258
00:24:07,965 --> 00:24:09,922
(Accident. It's purely accidental.)

259
00:24:10,047 --> 00:24:12,082
(Today, I must lean on his shoulder.)

260
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:33,242
Are you okay?

261
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:36,525
Are you tired?

262
00:24:37,602 --> 00:24:39,557
Yes, a little.

263
00:24:48,746 --> 00:24:50,146
Why don't

264
00:24:54,628 --> 00:24:56,028
I send you home then?

265
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:10,962
Yes.

266
00:25:19,325 --> 00:25:21,325
Yu You already contacted Bruce.

267
00:25:21,405 --> 00:25:23,525
Bruce insisted on his decision.

268
00:25:23,938 --> 00:25:26,898
But Le'an Technology also had its own research plan before Bruce came.

269
00:25:26,986 --> 00:25:29,186
Bruce left behind the results of his research during this period.

270
00:25:29,267 --> 00:25:31,060
So, you should have internal communication

271
00:25:31,141 --> 00:25:36,002
and quickly get back on track with your research to minimize losses.

272
00:25:49,649 --> 00:25:51,482
(Could it be Qin Le Zhi?)

273
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:39,158
You dress very well. Where did you go?

274
00:26:44,518 --> 00:26:45,559
What do you think?

275
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,369
Of course I dress so well just for you to see.

276
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:07,522
Are you hungry?

277
00:27:08,765 --> 00:27:09,805
No.

278
00:27:09,886 --> 00:27:11,296
Why did you keep looking at me then?

279
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:14,720
(Truly a feast for the eyes.)

280
00:27:15,674 --> 00:27:16,873
So what if I look at you?

281
00:27:16,954 --> 00:27:19,324
If you don't look at me, how do you know I'm looking at you?

282
00:27:25,374 --> 00:27:28,905
Last time, you seemed to mention you have a niece.

283
00:27:31,489 --> 00:27:33,690
She must be living a happy life, right?

284
00:27:33,771 --> 00:27:36,411
She can have fun every day and doesn't need to work.

285
00:27:36,685 --> 00:27:38,215
Who says she doesn't have to work?

286
00:27:39,586 --> 00:27:41,552
A princess from a rich family also needs to work?

287
00:27:41,633 --> 00:27:43,803
I thought she could directly inherit the family business.

288
00:27:44,465 --> 00:27:45,786
She doesn't have the ability.

289
00:27:45,904 --> 00:27:47,356
The expectation for her is already quite high

290
00:27:47,437 --> 00:27:48,661
if she can do well in a grassroots job.

291
00:27:48,775 --> 00:27:51,536
No one can inherit the family business without making efforts.

292
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,202
I see. You're quite the mentor.

293
00:28:27,325 --> 00:28:28,725
Why did you shy away?

294
00:28:29,986 --> 00:28:31,596
Can't I look at you?

295
00:28:34,676 --> 00:28:36,567
I'm afraid you'll be indulged in my beauty

296
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:38,314
and won't be able to control yourself.

297
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:40,882
I'm indulged.

298
00:28:41,129 --> 00:28:42,522
What are you afraid of?

299
00:28:48,483 --> 00:28:49,883
Are you afraid that I'll eat you?

300
00:29:00,285 --> 00:29:01,685
I look forward to that.

301
00:29:03,958 --> 00:29:05,487
Don't you feel embarrassed?

302
00:29:06,726 --> 00:29:08,616
You started it, didn't you?

303
00:29:11,509 --> 00:29:13,079
Do you listen to everything I say?

304
00:29:13,695 --> 00:29:14,814
I do.

305
00:29:14,895 --> 00:29:16,696
When did I not listen to what you said?

306
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:18,860
You asked me to work overtime here and I came.

307
00:29:25,852 --> 00:29:27,442
But now,

308
00:29:28,605 --> 00:29:30,255
I'm a little hungry.

309
00:29:33,453 --> 00:29:36,042
In broad daylight, this is your office.

310
00:29:36,123 --> 00:29:37,523
Isn't it inappropriate?

311
00:29:39,726 --> 00:29:41,177
What's inappropriate?

312
00:29:41,676 --> 00:29:43,322
People pursue both beauty and pleasure.

313
00:29:43,598 --> 00:29:47,087
Who says we can't do it in the office in broad daylight?

314
00:29:50,323 --> 00:29:54,013
If you say so, I have something urgent and need to go to the bathroom.

315
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:03,442
Tidy up the things in front of you. Get ready for lunch.

316
00:30:05,299 --> 00:30:06,525
What?

317
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,012
Are you not allowed to eat in the office during the day?

318
00:30:16,027 --> 00:30:20,116
Our company has strict rules. We're not allowed to eat in the office.

319
00:30:22,801 --> 00:30:24,002
Come in.

320
00:30:29,565 --> 00:30:30,965
Thanks.

321
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:37,962
(Overtime, documents, work meals.)

322
00:30:38,209 --> 00:30:40,322
(It's indeed a productive day.)

323
00:30:51,045 --> 00:30:53,324
I'm going to a meeting. Stay here for a while.

324
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:03,202
Do you usually eat cakes after meals?

325
00:31:06,026 --> 00:31:07,659
If you want to eat...

326
00:31:07,819 --> 00:31:08,962
No.

327
00:31:37,922 --> 00:31:42,722
(I feel like the situation is not going as I imagined.)

328
00:31:50,885 --> 00:31:52,402
(Are you free tonight?)

329
00:31:52,719 --> 00:31:53,844
(Same place.)

330
00:31:54,144 --> 00:31:55,544
(I'll pick you up.)

331
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:05,970
(What's wrong?)

332
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:12,082
(I seem to have deviated from the original track)

333
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:14,694
(and am running toward a different direction.)

334
00:32:15,925 --> 00:32:18,057
(You guys are so fast.)

335
00:32:19,925 --> 00:32:21,615
(What are you thinking about?)

336
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,387
(But I think he...)

337
00:32:23,468 --> 00:32:24,868
(What's up with him?)

338
00:32:27,485 --> 00:32:29,055
(He's very good.)

339
00:32:29,485 --> 00:32:32,375
(So good that I can't control myself.)

340
00:32:35,471 --> 00:32:37,948
(So, what are your thoughts now?)

341
00:32:40,303 --> 00:32:44,503
Initially, I approached him because I wanted to get the front page.

342
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:47,060
I wanted to get the exclusive interview and take him down

343
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:49,302
to impress Yue Xing Zhou.

344
00:32:50,178 --> 00:32:51,578
But now,

345
00:32:51,813 --> 00:32:54,742
I don't seem to care whether others will be impressed or not.

346
00:32:55,925 --> 00:32:57,325
Because I'm sure

347
00:32:57,626 --> 00:32:59,236
he likes me.

348
00:32:59,914 --> 00:33:01,923
He gets jealous for me.

349
00:33:02,114 --> 00:33:04,044
And he lets his guards down in front of me.

350
00:33:06,356 --> 00:33:07,756
So,

351
00:33:07,925 --> 00:33:09,615
I want to be with him,

352
00:33:09,901 --> 00:33:11,742
face the unknown future,

353
00:33:11,925 --> 00:33:13,482
spend the rest of my life with him

354
00:33:13,683 --> 00:33:15,083
and overcome all difficulties.

355
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:14,244
Wait for a while.

356
00:35:30,721 --> 00:35:33,011
(Actually, I've been wanting to say, )

357
00:35:33,651 --> 00:35:34,802
(I think)

358
00:35:34,938 --> 00:35:36,643
(even if you're not aiming for that, )

359
00:35:36,724 --> 00:35:39,482
(just pursuing this person is more than worth it.)

360
00:35:39,925 --> 00:35:43,734
(Not only that, it's like hitting the jackpot.)

361
00:35:44,279 --> 00:35:46,255
(Sister, go for it.)

362
00:35:46,336 --> 00:35:49,506
(I sincerely hope you marry into a wealthy family.)

363
00:36:03,805 --> 00:36:05,205
You're up.

364
00:36:06,493 --> 00:36:07,893
What are you doing here?

365
00:36:09,827 --> 00:36:11,317
This is my office.

366
00:36:13,202 --> 00:36:14,962
Then just now...

367
00:36:15,115 --> 00:36:17,244
I was washing my hands. What's the matter?

368
00:36:17,548 --> 00:36:19,828
(The bathroom door is closed.)

369
00:36:19,909 --> 00:36:22,239
(He probably didn't hear anything.)

370
00:36:23,059 --> 00:36:24,322
Nothing.

371
00:36:24,521 --> 00:36:25,970
I was just shocked.

372
00:36:26,215 --> 00:36:29,687
Is that so? Why didn't I notice before that you're so timid?

373
00:36:38,853 --> 00:36:40,442
You've turned my office into a hotel.

374
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,842
You didn't work.

375
00:36:43,445 --> 00:36:44,895
That's not true.

376
00:37:07,527 --> 00:37:08,856
I was scared to death.

377
00:37:08,964 --> 00:37:11,653
The things you said just now almost got heard by Shi Yan.

378
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,856
(Sister, go for it.)

379
00:37:18,103 --> 00:37:21,272
(I sincerely hope you marry into a wealthy family.)

380
00:37:23,515 --> 00:37:27,495
(Zheng Shu Yi, is this why you approached me?)

381
00:37:31,342 --> 00:37:32,402
(Never mind.)

382
00:37:32,802 --> 00:37:34,453
(No matter what's your purpose, )

383
00:37:34,731 --> 00:37:36,181
(I just want you.)

384
00:37:36,777 --> 00:37:39,322
You guys didn't see her?

385
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:41,091
Let's go to the meeting room.

386
00:37:41,172 --> 00:37:42,212
Okay.

387
00:37:51,643 --> 00:37:53,293
Do you want me to turn on the air conditioner?

388
00:37:56,913 --> 00:37:58,562
Yes, thank you.

389
00:38:14,357 --> 00:38:17,277
Professor Yu, we just passed by your company.

390
00:38:18,419 --> 00:38:19,602
What's wrong?

391
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,015
I often go to the Central Business District.

392
00:38:24,045 --> 00:38:25,614
Which company did you visit?

393
00:38:27,947 --> 00:38:29,556
IFC Mall.

394
00:38:31,153 --> 00:38:32,842
Did you go for an interview?

395
00:38:35,737 --> 00:38:39,938
You single-handedly boosted IFC Mall's GDP.

396
00:38:48,605 --> 00:38:52,734
Men are born with a desire to conquer.

397
00:38:54,898 --> 00:38:56,379
And let me tell you,

398
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,580
sometimes with these men,

399
00:38:57,692 --> 00:39:01,162
when you go around in circles with them too much, they get confused.

400
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:04,322
At a critical moment, you need to play straight,

401
00:39:04,412 --> 00:39:07,942
and leave them with no choice but to face it.

402
00:39:12,746 --> 00:39:14,146
Professor Yu.

403
00:39:14,609 --> 00:39:16,402
Do you have a girlfriend?

404
00:39:16,785 --> 00:39:17,962
No.

405
00:39:22,645 --> 00:39:25,682
What do you think about me?

406
00:39:26,355 --> 00:39:27,755
Quite good.

407
00:39:29,805 --> 00:39:31,562
(It looks promising.)

408
00:39:31,806 --> 00:39:33,816
(Then next...)

409
00:39:43,525 --> 00:39:44,925
Then...

410
00:39:50,066 --> 00:39:51,722
Go to your home.

411
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,002
Saturday?

412
00:39:56,434 --> 00:39:58,994
A two-day trip around the city should be no problem.

413
00:39:59,107 --> 00:40:02,277
But I have to bring my laptop. Maybe I will suddenly need to work.

414
00:40:04,041 --> 00:40:05,842
Wait for me to finish the meeting on Monday,

415
00:40:05,946 --> 00:40:08,946
confirm if there's anything important, and I'll get back to you.

416
00:40:09,742 --> 00:40:11,002
You're busy?

417
00:40:12,062 --> 00:40:13,762
I have something to do. I'm hanging up.

418
00:40:14,654 --> 00:40:15,842
What?

419
00:40:16,367 --> 00:40:19,207
Next Saturday and Sunday, a chip conference will be held in Fucheng.

420
00:40:19,327 --> 00:40:21,482
- Are you not going?   - Chip conference?

421
00:40:22,333 --> 00:40:23,962
Of course I want to go.

422
00:40:24,382 --> 00:40:26,991
It's just that I don't have the qualifications to enter.

423
00:40:28,494 --> 00:40:29,842
You have it now.

424
00:40:31,731 --> 00:40:32,848
Why?

425
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:34,562
Do you not want to go?

426
00:40:34,882 --> 00:40:38,252
Or do you want to go on a city tour with that old friend?

427
00:40:38,892 --> 00:40:41,382
No, I...

428
00:40:44,214 --> 00:40:46,624
Even the chip conference isn't attractive for you.

429
00:40:47,759 --> 00:40:50,079
Of course, the chip conference is attractive,

430
00:40:50,261 --> 00:40:52,191
but what's more attractive is...

431
00:40:53,545 --> 00:40:55,266
Can I stay with you throughout the event?

432
00:40:56,485 --> 00:40:57,642
Yes.

433
00:40:59,737 --> 00:41:00,939
Throughout,

434
00:41:01,052 --> 00:41:02,962
including eating and accommodation.

435
00:41:03,645 --> 00:41:04,882
How about it?

436
00:41:05,826 --> 00:41:07,676
Then, I want to make another request.

437
00:41:08,512 --> 00:41:09,802
Sure.

438
00:41:10,065 --> 00:41:13,785
If you're free on Friday, can we go to Fucheng earlier to tour around?

439
00:41:13,903 --> 00:41:16,802
Consider it as helping me relax to find inspiration.

440
00:41:20,765 --> 00:41:21,765
Okay.

441
00:41:31,415 --> 00:41:32,734
- It's Yi Yang.   - Yes.

442
00:41:32,819 --> 00:41:35,900
His live broadcast some time ago was breaking news.

443
00:41:35,981 --> 00:41:37,781
He looks so young.

444
00:41:37,899 --> 00:41:40,148
I didn't expect him to be so good.

445
00:41:41,391 --> 00:41:42,831
He's here to see Shu Yi again?

446
00:41:43,025 --> 00:41:44,282
I don't know.

447
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,860
Go.

448
00:41:56,084 --> 00:41:58,322
- Mr. Yi, have a drink.   - Thanks.

449
00:42:01,105 --> 00:42:04,326
Mr. Yi, your previous press conference was an eye-opener.

450
00:42:04,451 --> 00:42:07,861
I very much hope to have an opportunity to talk with you.

451
00:42:12,525 --> 00:42:14,009
As a senior journalist for Financial Introduce,

452
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:16,506
I can help you create a high-quality article

453
00:42:16,587 --> 00:42:19,042
to expand your reputation in the industry.

454
00:42:23,842 --> 00:42:26,813
Can you please remind Miss Zheng Shu Yi for me?

455
00:42:29,596 --> 00:42:30,842
Please wait a moment.

456
00:42:43,224 --> 00:42:44,764
- You're here.   - Mr. Yi.

457
00:42:54,052 --> 00:42:57,101
Miss Zheng, I came to ask you for an interview.

458
00:42:58,562 --> 00:43:01,731
Why are you so persistent in having me do this interview?

459
00:43:02,873 --> 00:43:04,442
Because I really like you.
