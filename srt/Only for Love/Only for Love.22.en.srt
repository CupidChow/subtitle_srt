00:01:30,802 --> 00:01:36,041
(Only For Love)

2
00:01:36,122 --> 00:01:39,042
(Episode 22)

3
00:01:43,042 --> 00:01:44,922
- You're here.   - Mr. Yi.

4
00:01:53,829 --> 00:01:56,931
Miss Zheng, I came to ask you for an interview.

5
00:01:58,387 --> 00:02:01,609
Why are you so persistent in having me do this interview?

6
00:02:02,682 --> 00:02:04,252
Because I really like you.

7
00:02:06,522 --> 00:02:07,922
And also your style of writing.

8
00:02:09,147 --> 00:02:11,213
Working with someone you like is the fastest way

9
00:02:11,303 --> 00:02:12,564
to bring two people together.

10
00:02:14,402 --> 00:02:15,961
If I'm interviewed by you,

11
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:17,481
you'll get to know everything about me.

12
00:02:17,561 --> 00:02:20,492
And I'll have the chance to show you my strength and every aspect of me.

13
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:23,411
You are really a straightforward person.

14
00:02:24,522 --> 00:02:25,922
Isn't it better to be straightforward?

15
00:02:26,202 --> 00:02:27,602
That's what I think.

16
00:02:28,091 --> 00:02:29,411
You are a good man.

17
00:02:29,522 --> 00:02:30,922
But we are not suitable for each other.

18
00:02:31,321 --> 00:02:32,629
Not suitable.

19
00:02:34,264 --> 00:02:36,234
It means that you don't hate me.

20
00:02:36,522 --> 00:02:38,081
You just objectively judge

21
00:02:38,161 --> 00:02:40,211
that we are not suitable for each other.

22
00:02:42,721 --> 00:02:44,121
Let me guess.

23
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:47,332
You reject me because you already have a boyfriend.

24
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:48,809
Right?

25
00:02:49,171 --> 00:02:50,571
Why did you say that?

26
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,241
I may sound pompous to say this.

27
00:02:53,362 --> 00:02:54,762
But,

28
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,120
when I confessed my love to you,

29
00:02:57,202 --> 00:02:58,842
you rejected me

30
00:02:58,922 --> 00:03:00,371
without giving it a second thought.

31
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,991
It must be because you already have someone.

32
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:04,652
That's why you won't even look at others.

33
00:03:04,881 --> 00:03:06,162
Right?

34
00:03:10,561 --> 00:03:11,961
It's okay.

35
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:14,931
Most people choose love on a whim.

36
00:03:15,058 --> 00:03:17,097
So, it may not be a perfect choice.

37
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,829
Now, you have a new option.

38
00:03:20,355 --> 00:03:21,885
You can do this exclusive interview with me

39
00:03:22,163 --> 00:03:23,693
to make a comparison between the two of us

40
00:03:24,321 --> 00:03:26,012
so that you can make a better choice.

41
00:03:30,321 --> 00:03:31,641
Mr. Yi.

42
00:03:31,721 --> 00:03:33,651
I do have a boyfriend.

43
00:03:33,731 --> 00:03:35,850
And he's a great man.

44
00:03:36,001 --> 00:03:37,411
We won't break up.

45
00:03:40,643 --> 00:03:42,043
You are afraid to compare him with me

46
00:03:42,954 --> 00:03:44,445
because he's not as good as I am.

47
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:46,470
There's no need to compare when you love someone.

48
00:03:47,161 --> 00:03:49,441
And I'm not afraid to compare him with you.

49
00:03:49,922 --> 00:03:52,251
Getting an exclusive interview with you is indeed very valuable.

50
00:03:52,402 --> 00:03:54,492
I will consider your offer.

51
00:03:56,249 --> 00:03:57,649
Interesting.

52
00:03:58,443 --> 00:03:59,892
I'll wait for your good news then.

53
00:04:03,642 --> 00:04:05,042
Mr. Yi.

54
00:04:05,867 --> 00:04:07,343
Thank you for placing your trust in us.

55
00:04:07,482 --> 00:04:10,002
No matter who it is that will take over this exclusive interview,

56
00:04:10,082 --> 00:04:11,241
I promise you

57
00:04:11,321 --> 00:04:13,811
that it'll be an article of the highest quality.

58
00:04:14,561 --> 00:04:15,763
Thank you.

59
00:04:15,962 --> 00:04:18,469
Of course I trust Miss Zheng's capability.

60
00:04:20,042 --> 00:04:21,931
See you again, Ms. Yi.

61
00:04:22,021 --> 00:04:23,261
Okay.

62
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,381
Shu Yi has not agreed yet?

63
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,011
You haven't agreed to Yi Yang's interview, right?

64
00:04:44,122 --> 00:04:45,361
What are you thinking?

65
00:04:45,441 --> 00:04:46,681
What's troubling you?

66
00:04:46,761 --> 00:04:48,241
It's not like you

67
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:49,721
to give up this kind of chance.

68
00:04:51,922 --> 00:04:54,251
I'm indeed troubled by something.

69
00:04:55,282 --> 00:04:56,682
What is it?

70
00:04:58,521 --> 00:05:00,852
He's trying to pursue me by trying to get me to interview him.

71
00:05:03,321 --> 00:05:04,561
That's normal.

72
00:05:04,641 --> 00:05:06,801
You are beautiful and charismatic.

73
00:05:06,881 --> 00:05:09,492
It's normal that he's attracted to you.

74
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:14,437
And it seems like

75
00:05:14,602 --> 00:05:16,371
you have no feelings for him.

76
00:05:16,857 --> 00:05:19,137
So, it won't affect your job, right?

77
00:05:19,612 --> 00:05:22,154
I know the value of this exclusive interview with Yi Yang.

78
00:05:22,321 --> 00:05:23,656
So, I didn't reject him.

79
00:05:23,779 --> 00:05:25,339
But I need some time to consider.

80
00:05:25,482 --> 00:05:28,282
But I really can't accept that he's trying to get closer to me

81
00:05:28,362 --> 00:05:29,762
by asking me to interview him.

82
00:05:30,115 --> 00:05:33,282
Ms. Yi, I won't let love affect my career.

83
00:05:33,362 --> 00:05:35,801
But I won't sacrifice love for my career too.

84
00:05:35,881 --> 00:05:38,321
In my heart, both are equally important to me.

85
00:05:38,401 --> 00:05:40,801
I won't let anything threaten and affect them.

86
00:05:41,914 --> 00:05:43,314
I understand.

87
00:05:44,641 --> 00:05:46,131
Think about it then.

88
00:05:52,049 --> 00:05:53,449
Take a look at this.

89
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:55,059
After the live press conference,

90
00:05:55,173 --> 00:05:57,584
Yi Yang has remained popular according to the new media data.

91
00:05:57,706 --> 00:05:59,106
He's a hot topic right now.

92
00:05:59,257 --> 00:06:00,898
It's a golden opportunity for you

93
00:06:00,987 --> 00:06:02,837
to promote your digital magazine.

94
00:06:04,561 --> 00:06:06,052
I understand what you mean.

95
00:06:07,042 --> 00:06:09,612
I may need some time

96
00:06:09,826 --> 00:06:12,187
to discuss it with someone who's very important to me.

97
00:06:16,802 --> 00:06:17,882
Okay.

98
00:06:18,891 --> 00:06:20,420
Go and discuss it with you.

99
00:06:23,138 --> 00:06:24,297
Another thing.

100
00:06:24,401 --> 00:06:26,602
I'm going to attend the Chip Conference in Fucheng this weekend.

101
00:06:26,682 --> 00:06:28,251
I would like to apply to depart on Friday.

102
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,080
The Chip Conference?

103
00:06:30,881 --> 00:06:32,281
How are you going to go?

104
00:06:32,881 --> 00:06:34,612
We are not invited this year.

105
00:06:36,435 --> 00:06:38,322
Shi Yan is going to take me there.

106
00:06:39,961 --> 00:06:41,361
Shi...

107
00:06:43,282 --> 00:06:44,682
Shi Yan?

108
00:06:48,602 --> 00:06:50,002
He's taking you there?

109
00:06:51,362 --> 00:06:53,571
Yes. You've heard it right.

110
00:06:58,242 --> 00:06:59,513
Okay.

111
00:06:59,818 --> 00:07:01,218
Go on then.

112
00:07:01,765 --> 00:07:03,165
Wait.

113
00:07:06,395 --> 00:07:08,804
Why is Shi Yan taking you there?

114
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,094
What's your relationship with him?

115
00:07:15,761 --> 00:07:17,251
Are you in this kind of relationship?

116
00:07:19,468 --> 00:07:20,882
Ms. Yi, just ask if you want to know.

117
00:07:21,011 --> 00:07:22,421
There's no need to do this.

118
00:07:23,802 --> 00:07:25,251
So, am I right?

119
00:07:29,555 --> 00:07:31,434
Okay now. You can go.

120
00:07:31,561 --> 00:07:33,321
Remember to get the OA Permit.

121
00:07:33,401 --> 00:07:37,331
And remember to discuss it with that person.

122
00:07:45,925 --> 00:07:47,375
This lady

123
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:49,167
is really as brave as Guan has said

124
00:07:50,482 --> 00:07:51,786
she is.

125
00:08:13,401 --> 00:08:15,562
(Hello, Yi. What is it?)

126
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:18,481
Guan.

127
00:08:18,961 --> 00:08:22,321
Have I done very badly?

128
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:24,986
What are you talking about?

129
00:08:25,626 --> 00:08:27,026
(What I'm trying to say is)

130
00:08:27,561 --> 00:08:30,010
I've set up so many rules for our relationship.

131
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,435
You have to be so secretive about this relationship because of me.

132
00:08:32,641 --> 00:08:34,492
Have I made you unhappy?

133
00:08:37,122 --> 00:08:38,812
Why would you think that way?

134
00:08:39,122 --> 00:08:41,371
I'm very happy to be with you.

135
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:44,173
Just now, Shu Yi told me

136
00:08:44,393 --> 00:08:46,514
that she would not sacrifice love for her career.

137
00:08:46,602 --> 00:08:48,291
And she would not let love

138
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:49,962
affect her career.

139
00:08:50,362 --> 00:08:51,762
So, I suddenly feel like

140
00:08:52,362 --> 00:08:53,812
I've done you wrong.

141
00:08:57,641 --> 00:09:00,578
There's no such thing as that between us.

142
00:09:01,202 --> 00:09:03,787
I have many flaws too, right?

143
00:09:04,042 --> 00:09:05,692
And you've been very accepting of me.

144
00:09:07,122 --> 00:09:08,522
As lovers,

145
00:09:08,602 --> 00:09:11,441
it's only right for us to tolerate each other

146
00:09:11,521 --> 00:09:12,921
and be understanding towards each other?

147
00:09:15,435 --> 00:09:17,771
Are you willing to give me more time?

148
00:09:18,236 --> 00:09:19,766
Let me plan it

149
00:09:20,419 --> 00:09:21,909
and then, I'll announce our relationship.

150
00:09:24,401 --> 00:09:26,054
It doesn't matter if you announce it or not.

151
00:09:27,731 --> 00:09:29,251
The most important thing

152
00:09:29,401 --> 00:09:30,852
is for us to have a good relationship.

153
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:36,851
When you really want to announce it one day,

154
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,820
then, we can talk about this, okay?

155
00:09:41,082 --> 00:09:42,482
Okay.

156
00:09:42,962 --> 00:09:44,371
Thank you, Guan.

157
00:10:04,988 --> 00:10:06,388
You've become reserved.

158
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,618
I've always been reserved and shy.

159
00:10:21,482 --> 00:10:23,251
Why didn't you pay attention while you walked?

160
00:10:28,098 --> 00:10:29,965
I have you.

161
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,640
I'll look at the road when I walk by myself.

162
00:10:34,242 --> 00:10:36,371
Is it very boring to go on a date with me?

163
00:10:37,155 --> 00:10:38,435
No.

164
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:40,285
I'm thinking about work.

165
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:44,419
Looks like in your heart,

166
00:10:44,546 --> 00:10:47,196
your career will always be more important than your boyfriend.

167
00:10:53,401 --> 00:10:54,801
Actually,

168
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,531
Yi Yang from Dark Horse asked for me.

169
00:10:58,618 --> 00:10:59,898
He hopes that I can interview him.

170
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,042
And he proposed to publish that exclusive interview

171
00:11:02,122 --> 00:11:03,522
in the digital magazine.

172
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:05,898
Isn't that great?

173
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,771
Your New Year's wish is going to come true.

174
00:11:09,881 --> 00:11:11,891
He also confessed his love to me.

175
00:11:13,801 --> 00:11:16,543
But I rejected him at once on the spot.

176
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,119
I told him that I already have a boyfriend

177
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,441
who's handsome, capable, and charismatic.

178
00:11:20,521 --> 00:11:22,402
I told him that we are in love with each other

179
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:24,118
and that I'll never leave my boyfriend.

180
00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:26,799
And I told him that I'll never accept him.

181
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:31,122
Well said.

182
00:11:31,571 --> 00:11:32,812
And then?

183
00:11:33,722 --> 00:11:35,081
And then, he said

184
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:37,162
that he doesn't care if I have a boyfriend or not.

185
00:11:37,242 --> 00:11:39,765
He hopes that I can know him better from the interview

186
00:11:39,864 --> 00:11:42,744
and compare him to do so that I can reconsider my choices.

187
00:11:43,962 --> 00:11:45,721
So, I'm in a dilemma now.

188
00:11:45,801 --> 00:11:47,721
I want to grab this chance to interview him

189
00:11:47,801 --> 00:11:49,801
but I don't want it to affect our relationship.

190
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,892
So, you keep thinking about another man

191
00:11:54,018 --> 00:11:56,669
while being on a date with me.

192
00:11:57,962 --> 00:11:59,411
Looks like you found out.

193
00:12:06,082 --> 00:12:07,355
Do you know?

194
00:12:07,562 --> 00:12:08,962
Sometimes, I'll wonder

195
00:12:09,442 --> 00:12:11,572
what kind of fairy you are.

196
00:12:11,722 --> 00:12:15,282
You are smart, ambitious, and responsible.

197
00:12:15,448 --> 00:12:17,137
Who else can succeed if not her?

198
00:12:18,635 --> 00:12:20,035
Shu Yi.

199
00:12:20,164 --> 00:12:22,602
No matter what your decision is, I'll support you.

200
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,559
Besides, maybe after you interview Yi Yang,

201
00:12:25,681 --> 00:12:26,801
you'll like me even more

202
00:12:26,881 --> 00:12:28,722
and know for sure that you've chosen the right person.

203
00:12:31,841 --> 00:12:33,202
You are right.

204
00:12:33,322 --> 00:12:36,561
Even if I interview 100 or even 1000 Yi Yang,

205
00:12:38,602 --> 00:12:41,492
I still like you the most, Shi Yan.

206
00:12:44,133 --> 00:12:46,452
Shu Yi, you are a great woman.

207
00:12:46,547 --> 00:12:48,388
Many will fall for you.

208
00:12:48,657 --> 00:12:50,165
If we have to guard against everyone,

209
00:12:50,256 --> 00:12:52,391
asking you to keep everyone at arm's length

210
00:12:52,482 --> 00:12:54,216
is the most foolish and ineffective way.

211
00:12:55,202 --> 00:12:56,602
Wait.

212
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:01,201
This is your first time complimenting me like this.

213
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,681
I have to record it.

214
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,529
You have your own career.

215
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,852
And you are passionate about it.

216
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,759
When you are focused on work,

217
00:13:12,921 --> 00:13:15,441
you shine like the brightest star.

218
00:13:16,442 --> 00:13:17,961
But everything that I took pride in

219
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:21,011
means nothing in our relationship.

220
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:24,732
I was at a loss once because of your brilliance.

221
00:13:25,265 --> 00:13:26,466
But I know

222
00:13:26,562 --> 00:13:28,632
that it's the same light that has attracted me

223
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:30,452
and led me to you.

224
00:13:31,801 --> 00:13:34,076
I hope that you'll shine brighter and brighter

225
00:13:34,167 --> 00:13:35,936
and I'll do the same too

226
00:13:36,161 --> 00:13:37,562
so that we can shine brightly together

227
00:13:37,881 --> 00:13:39,411
until we can see no one else but each other.

228
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,888
Shi Yan.

229
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:08,829
I'll love you well.

230
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,440
I won't betray you.

231
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,860
Have you recorded everything?

232
00:14:21,563 --> 00:14:24,175
If I'm going to interview Yi Yang,

233
00:14:24,282 --> 00:14:26,162
I have to get ready for it.

234
00:14:26,546 --> 00:14:28,146
Then, I'll have to stand you up

235
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,011
for our short getaway on Friday.

236
00:14:34,228 --> 00:14:36,897
You can lend your working hours to Yi Yang.

237
00:14:37,322 --> 00:14:40,651
But your private time belongs to me alone.

238
00:14:42,161 --> 00:14:43,432
Roger that.

239
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,840
Let me tell you.

240
00:14:47,931 --> 00:14:49,172
When you reach Fucheng,

241
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,397
you need to try out the sea urchin dumplings first.

242
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,040
You need to tell me if they taste good or not.

243
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,911
Okay. I'll bring them back for you.

244
00:14:56,284 --> 00:14:57,404
Shan Shan.

245
00:14:57,562 --> 00:14:58,921
This is not like you.

246
00:14:59,001 --> 00:15:00,762
In the past, you would stay away as far as you can

247
00:15:00,842 --> 00:15:02,531
from this kind of event.

248
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,511
(I'm going to Fucheng this weekend for the Chip Conference.)

249
00:15:05,602 --> 00:15:08,969
(I'll return to Jiangcheng after that. So, this week, let us...)

250
00:15:10,482 --> 00:15:12,922
It's the Chip Conference.

251
00:15:13,047 --> 00:15:14,967
The mass media will be there.

252
00:15:15,161 --> 00:15:17,891
Our company needs to make a good impression on everyone.

253
00:15:18,281 --> 00:15:21,482
And I'm the best candidate for the job.

254
00:15:21,622 --> 00:15:23,602
Listen to what you are saying to me.

255
00:15:23,721 --> 00:15:25,556
I said the same thing to you in the past.

256
00:15:25,746 --> 00:15:27,146
And how did you answer me?

257
00:15:28,202 --> 00:15:29,487
You

258
00:15:30,074 --> 00:15:31,762
must be plotting something.

259
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:34,898
Are you going there to meet your boyfriend?

260
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,722
What are you talking about, Mr. Shen?

261
00:15:37,914 --> 00:15:39,188
You know me.

262
00:15:39,298 --> 00:15:41,588
I'll not travel for anyone.

263
00:15:42,281 --> 00:15:45,732
But I can't stay out of the field forever, right?

264
00:15:46,224 --> 00:15:48,873
Just let me go. I'll get you some local specialties from Fucheng.

265
00:15:50,499 --> 00:15:52,552
Fine. You can go.

266
00:15:52,674 --> 00:15:55,842
In the future, I'll ask you to do the same again.

267
00:15:56,161 --> 00:15:57,916
You better not reject me when the time comes.

268
00:15:58,007 --> 00:16:00,562
No problem. I'll do as you say.

269
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,403
Go now.

270
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,882
- I'm leaving. Bye.   - Bye.

271
00:16:06,617 --> 00:16:08,867
I know a very reliable renovation team.

272
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:11,500
If you need it, I can contact the team for you.

273
00:16:14,521 --> 00:16:16,122
After I install the door for you,

274
00:16:16,264 --> 00:16:17,914
you'll be out of excuses.

275
00:16:22,801 --> 00:16:23,879
Yue.

276
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,082
Who are you installing the door for?

277
00:16:28,586 --> 00:16:30,836
Professor Yu.

278
00:16:31,641 --> 00:16:34,251
You've just met him twice and you are so close to him already.

279
00:16:36,921 --> 00:16:38,155
Wait.

280
00:16:40,482 --> 00:16:42,011
Did the two of you do something else

281
00:16:42,116 --> 00:16:43,516
after the exhibition that day?

282
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:46,321
After the exhibition that day,

283
00:16:46,412 --> 00:16:48,402
we went to watch a movie.

284
00:16:48,562 --> 00:16:49,962
Watch a movie?

285
00:16:51,842 --> 00:16:54,251
You and Yu You?

286
00:16:55,001 --> 00:16:56,692
The two of you...

287
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,531
I like Professor Yu.

288
00:17:05,019 --> 00:17:07,018
Did he send you home?

289
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,320
Did something happen between the two of you?

290
00:17:09,441 --> 00:17:11,042
Don't mention it ever again.

291
00:17:11,123 --> 00:17:13,704
- What's wrong?   - I was so unlucky that day.

292
00:17:14,473 --> 00:17:16,714
He sent me home after the movie.

293
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:18,762
The moment felt right.

294
00:17:18,842 --> 00:17:21,556
So, I asked him if we could go to his house or not.

295
00:17:21,642 --> 00:17:22,923
And then?

296
00:17:23,004 --> 00:17:25,533
In the end, he said, not a door.

297
00:17:26,634 --> 00:17:28,314
Don't you think that was too unfortunate?

298
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:30,762
So, I'm looking for someone to install the door for him.

299
00:17:38,082 --> 00:17:40,682
(Shan Shan said that I'm the love killer.)

300
00:17:40,762 --> 00:17:43,331
(But the real love killer is here.)

301
00:18:01,762 --> 00:18:02,881
Shu Yi.

302
00:18:02,961 --> 00:18:04,361
You agreed to interview Yi Yang?

303
00:18:07,847 --> 00:18:10,438
By the way, I heard that you applied for leave.

304
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:12,489
Are you going to another event again?

305
00:18:13,167 --> 00:18:15,362
(I better not mention anything about the Chip Conference.)

306
00:18:15,443 --> 00:18:18,289
(I'm going there with Shi Yan after all. What should I tell her?)

307
00:18:19,601 --> 00:18:21,932
I have to do something with my dad.

308
00:18:24,122 --> 00:18:26,052
(A client is kind of like our dad too.)

309
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,640
I thought that you had found a way

310
00:18:28,731 --> 00:18:30,341
to attend the Chip Conference.

311
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,652
We are not as resourceful as Yu Ling.

312
00:18:33,921 --> 00:18:37,242
So, don't forget about us next time if you have something good.

313
00:18:37,338 --> 00:18:38,634
No problem.

314
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,720
Shu Yi.

315
00:18:47,842 --> 00:18:49,772
When is the Chip Conference?

316
00:18:50,106 --> 00:18:51,506
This weekend.

317
00:18:52,961 --> 00:18:56,172
Do you think Professor Yu will be there?

318
00:18:57,978 --> 00:19:01,113
He's a strategy consultant in Guan. He's on the invitation list too.

319
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:03,281
Now, Le'an is in a critical situation.

320
00:19:03,401 --> 00:19:04,801
I think he'll be there.

321
00:19:10,785 --> 00:19:14,322
(Guan Ji, are you going to attend the Chip Conference?)

322
00:19:14,605 --> 00:19:16,042
(Please bring me along.)

323
00:19:16,177 --> 00:19:17,391
(I beg you.)

324
00:19:26,028 --> 00:19:27,428
(Hello, Shan Shan.)

325
00:19:28,802 --> 00:19:31,932
Our company is going to send me to the Chip Conference for fieldwork.

326
00:19:32,282 --> 00:19:34,669
Can you give me a ride if it's not too much trouble for you?

327
00:19:35,562 --> 00:19:37,282
(I'm sorry, Shan Shan. I...)

328
00:19:38,816 --> 00:19:41,282
It's okay. I'll ask someone else to give me a ride.

329
00:19:41,401 --> 00:19:42,801
That's it. I have to hang up now.

330
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,720
Mr. Yi, thank you

331
00:20:00,818 --> 00:20:03,304
for giving me this opportunity to interview you.

332
00:20:03,641 --> 00:20:05,611
I should thank you for agreeing to interview me.

333
00:20:05,793 --> 00:20:07,193
You can just call me Yi Yang.

334
00:20:07,721 --> 00:20:09,121
By the way,

335
00:20:09,522 --> 00:20:10,922
you look very beautiful today.

336
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,100
Thank you for your compliment, Mr. Yi.

337
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,082
I think it's better for me to address you as Mr. Yi in our interview.

338
00:20:19,522 --> 00:20:20,641
Sure.

339
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:23,242
I'll address you as Miss Zheng

340
00:20:23,377 --> 00:20:24,827
during this interview then.

341
00:20:25,602 --> 00:20:28,132
But can I call you Shu Yi after the interview?

342
00:20:30,961 --> 00:20:33,202
In exchange, you can call me by my name too.

343
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:37,171
You are indeed a persistent

344
00:20:37,322 --> 00:20:38,582
businessman.

345
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:43,529
You are trying to make a deal out of a form of address.

346
00:20:43,664 --> 00:20:45,824
Are you that used to talking about business?

347
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:50,281
Let us start now.

348
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,730
First, let me ask you something that everyone is curious about.

349
00:20:57,082 --> 00:20:59,675
You have a successful career abroad.

350
00:20:59,766 --> 00:21:01,773
Why did you suddenly choose to come back?

351
00:21:03,401 --> 00:21:04,811
Because

352
00:21:07,441 --> 00:21:08,841
I can't get used to their food.

353
00:21:11,219 --> 00:21:14,309
No matter how premium the ingredients are

354
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,641
or how well-seasoned the food is,

355
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,235
it's still something that I can't get used to.

356
00:21:17,316 --> 00:21:18,922
If we have a good chef,

357
00:21:19,122 --> 00:21:21,251
our Chinese cuisine can go international too.

358
00:21:23,818 --> 00:21:26,202
So, I want to come back and be that good chef.

359
00:21:26,641 --> 00:21:28,932
That answer really sounds like you.

360
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,600
You named your company Dark Horse.

361
00:21:32,703 --> 00:21:34,103
Is there a meaning behind it?

362
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,200
I name it Dark Horse

363
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:40,186
because I have a feeling it'll be a dark horse that can be led to success.

364
00:21:41,241 --> 00:21:43,242
Looks like you are very confident in Dark Horse.

365
00:21:43,322 --> 00:21:44,722
Of course.

366
00:21:46,475 --> 00:21:47,875
With Bruce's assistance,

367
00:21:48,002 --> 00:21:49,337
it's like an extra boost for us.

368
00:21:50,522 --> 00:21:53,372
How did you convince Professor Bruce to work for you?

369
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,859
I don't think it's accurate to say that I convinced him to work for me.

370
00:21:57,972 --> 00:22:01,132
To be more precise, Bruce and I hit it off right away.

371
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:02,770
Before I returned to my homeland,

372
00:22:02,881 --> 00:22:05,841
we became fast friends when I met him while I was studying abroad.

373
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,880
And we continue to pay close attention to each other.

374
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,561
This time, we chose to be partners

375
00:22:10,641 --> 00:22:11,965
and work on the company together.

376
00:22:12,881 --> 00:22:16,756
I think no one in our country can compete with us yet.

377
00:22:17,547 --> 00:22:21,172
I think I understand now why Professor Bruce will be attracted to you.

378
00:22:22,217 --> 00:22:24,458
Your confidence is indeed very charming.

379
00:22:24,562 --> 00:22:26,972
It gives others a sense of security.

380
00:22:27,707 --> 00:22:30,236
I can only be confident if I have the capability to back it up.

381
00:22:30,441 --> 00:22:32,972
And I can only have limitless possibilities when I'm confident.

382
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:36,412
Others have been talking about something.

383
00:22:36,602 --> 00:22:39,692
They say that Black Horse is targeting Le'an Technology and Yunchuang.

384
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,630
Is that true?

385
00:22:42,921 --> 00:22:44,412
What do you think, Miss Zheng?

386
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:48,011
You want to know my opinion?

387
00:22:48,441 --> 00:22:50,066
It's always beneficial to hear other's opinions.

388
00:22:51,481 --> 00:22:54,030
It makes sense if you want to target Le'an.

389
00:22:54,219 --> 00:22:55,498
As for Yunchuang,

390
00:22:55,586 --> 00:22:58,602
it's an investment company while you are a technology company.

391
00:22:58,762 --> 00:23:01,291
It doesn't make sense for the two of you to compete against each other.

392
00:23:02,522 --> 00:23:03,922
That's right.

393
00:23:05,282 --> 00:23:08,932
Next, let's talk about Dark Horse's vision.

394
00:23:19,201 --> 00:23:20,510
Guan Ji.

395
00:23:25,881 --> 00:23:27,238
What's wrong?

396
00:23:27,787 --> 00:23:30,452
What did you do? Why do you look so haggard?

397
00:23:32,522 --> 00:23:34,082
I didn't do anything.

398
00:23:34,802 --> 00:23:36,412
I'm like this because of you.

399
00:23:57,147 --> 00:23:59,477
Looks like he has been hurt by love.

400
00:24:14,921 --> 00:24:16,321
(Are you done packing?)

401
00:24:17,275 --> 00:24:20,042
I'm going to pack myself up and go to you now.

402
00:24:20,122 --> 00:24:22,317
(You can go down now. Mr. Fan is already there to pick you up.)

403
00:24:22,762 --> 00:24:24,162
(I'll wait for you in Fucheng.)

404
00:24:40,842 --> 00:24:42,242
Shu Yi.

405
00:24:46,602 --> 00:24:48,002
Shu Yi.

406
00:24:48,641 --> 00:24:49,964
What is it?

407
00:24:50,161 --> 00:24:51,892
I've been waiting for you here.

408
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:53,682
I have something to say to you.

409
00:24:53,762 --> 00:24:55,611
But I don't want to listen to you.

410
00:24:55,967 --> 00:24:57,577
Let go of me. I have things to do.

411
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:00,402
Just give me a few minutes, Shu Yi.

412
00:25:04,779 --> 00:25:07,827
Fine. I'll give you two minutes. Talk now.

413
00:25:12,602 --> 00:25:13,922
Shu Yi.

414
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,411
Do you have a new boyfriend now?

415
00:25:17,539 --> 00:25:18,939
What has it got to do with you?

416
00:25:19,721 --> 00:25:21,571
You can have a new boyfriend.

417
00:25:21,762 --> 00:25:23,442
I know that it is out of my place.

418
00:25:23,553 --> 00:25:27,802
But are you in a relationship with a married man?

419
00:25:28,763 --> 00:25:30,282
Are you crazy?

420
00:25:30,764 --> 00:25:33,363
Do you think I have the same fetish as your girlfriend?

421
00:25:33,553 --> 00:25:35,832
Sorry to disappoint.

422
00:25:36,483 --> 00:25:38,707
I know that I have no right to say this to you.

423
00:25:38,842 --> 00:25:41,161
But there's no reason for Le Zhi to slander you.

424
00:25:41,241 --> 00:25:43,856
I hope you can turn back from the wrong path.

425
00:25:47,258 --> 00:25:50,017
Yue Xing Zhou, do you think that you are being kind?

426
00:25:50,138 --> 00:25:51,818
You and Qin Le Zhi are so ridiculous.

427
00:25:51,929 --> 00:25:53,490
You cheated on me with her.

428
00:25:53,602 --> 00:25:55,708
And now, you are trying to lecture me about my relationship?

429
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:57,409
Do you want me to slap you again?

430
00:26:02,241 --> 00:26:03,722
Before you advise me about morality,

431
00:26:03,802 --> 00:26:06,002
you better make sure you have it first.

432
00:26:06,322 --> 00:26:07,361
Move aside.

433
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:09,522
I have no time to chat with you.

434
00:26:09,602 --> 00:26:11,011
My boyfriend is still waiting for me.

435
00:26:17,098 --> 00:26:18,859
- Isn't he...   - Yes.

436
00:26:19,002 --> 00:26:21,401
He's my real boyfriend.

437
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:23,417
What is it? Do you want to say something about it too?

438
00:26:24,308 --> 00:26:26,242
- How did you...   - What's wrong?

439
00:26:26,322 --> 00:26:28,417
We are a match made in heaven and we love each other.

440
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,449
Do we have to get your permission to be together?

441
00:26:33,522 --> 00:26:35,641
Shu Yi, are you trying to take revenge on me?

442
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,600
Yue Xing Zhou.

443
00:26:42,691 --> 00:26:44,962
You've overestimated yourself.

444
00:26:45,042 --> 00:26:46,519
We'll be relatives after this.

445
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:48,490
You better show some respect to me, your elder.

446
00:26:48,641 --> 00:26:50,492
Don't put your hands on me ever again.

447
00:26:56,449 --> 00:26:57,771
Thank you.

448
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,438
Miss Zheng. Mr. Shi had already gone there in the afternoon.

449
00:27:14,641 --> 00:27:16,372
He asked me to take you there too.

450
00:27:16,961 --> 00:27:18,361
Okay. Thank you.

451
00:27:27,731 --> 00:27:29,010
Are you in the car already?

452
00:27:29,161 --> 00:27:30,561
(I'm already on my way.)

453
00:27:31,153 --> 00:27:34,082
Okay. The journey is a few hours long. Have a good rest.

454
00:27:34,209 --> 00:27:35,489
See you tonight.

455
00:27:38,441 --> 00:27:40,452
What's wrong? Are you unhappy?

456
00:27:40,762 --> 00:27:42,162
(No.)

457
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:45,709
Mr. Shi, why are you standing here instead of going in?

458
00:27:49,235 --> 00:27:50,514
I'll let you get back to work.

459
00:27:50,641 --> 00:27:51,762
I want to sleep for a while.

460
00:27:51,865 --> 00:27:53,594
I'll message you when I've arrived.

461
00:27:54,522 --> 00:27:56,611
Okay. See you tonight.

462
00:28:01,442 --> 00:28:03,469
(Shu Yi, are you trying to take revenge on me?)

463
00:28:05,554 --> 00:28:06,835
(If anyone finds out about this, )

464
00:28:06,926 --> 00:28:10,202
(they'll think that I'm using Shi Yan to seek revenge on Yue Xing Zhou.)

465
00:28:10,425 --> 00:28:11,956
(If Shi Yan finds out about it, )

466
00:28:12,082 --> 00:28:13,482
(he'll think the same way too.)

467
00:28:32,885 --> 00:28:35,939
(Professor Yu, have you departed to Fucheng?)

468
00:28:43,026 --> 00:28:44,676
(How do you know about my schedule?)

469
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,680
(Shu Yi says that this Chip Conference is too important)

470
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:53,171
(for you to skip it.)

471
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:56,049
(I'm going to depart now.)

472
00:28:59,291 --> 00:29:00,940
(Be careful on the road.)

473
00:29:05,794 --> 00:29:07,783
Who are you chatting with? You look so happy.

474
00:29:07,906 --> 00:29:10,482
Have you already recovered from love in less than 10 minutes?

475
00:29:10,562 --> 00:29:11,861
Why are you such a busybody?

476
00:29:12,674 --> 00:29:15,228
I'm a busybody? I'm just worried about you.

477
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:18,671
Men nowadays are very cunning.

478
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:20,251
I just don't want you to get bullied.

479
00:29:20,362 --> 00:29:21,601
If you have any issues,

480
00:29:21,681 --> 00:29:23,331
you can consult in me about it.

481
00:29:23,441 --> 00:29:25,051
I know men better than you do.

482
00:29:27,042 --> 00:29:28,259
You better believe me.

483
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,550
If you consult with me,

484
00:29:29,664 --> 00:29:32,258
I'll be able to help you with my rich experience.

485
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,638
Then, you'll know how good I am.

486
00:29:40,681 --> 00:29:42,771
I have a friend

487
00:29:43,161 --> 00:29:44,561
who likes A.

488
00:29:45,042 --> 00:29:48,452
But A tells my friend that he likes someone like B.

489
00:29:49,122 --> 00:29:52,132
But it looks like B is not interested in A.

490
00:29:53,322 --> 00:29:57,815
But my friend can't turn into someone like B

491
00:29:57,995 --> 00:29:59,395
for the time being.

492
00:29:59,802 --> 00:30:01,571
If you were my friend, what would you do?

493
00:30:03,386 --> 00:30:04,506
Young lady.

494
00:30:04,621 --> 00:30:07,317
You started off with such a complicated issue of a love triangle.

495
00:30:07,641 --> 00:30:09,172
Can you help her or not?

496
00:30:11,783 --> 00:30:14,323
The man who you like is not a good man.

497
00:30:14,684 --> 00:30:16,654
Not me. My friend.

498
00:30:17,309 --> 00:30:18,522
Okay.

499
00:30:18,602 --> 00:30:20,372
Your friend already told A

500
00:30:20,676 --> 00:30:22,076
that she liked him.

501
00:30:22,322 --> 00:30:25,482
But A told your friend that he liked B.

502
00:30:25,577 --> 00:30:26,987
He's acting like a pick-up artist.

503
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:31,011
Even if your friend manages to win him over,

504
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,290
someone else will always live in A's heart.

505
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:36,801
Listen to me. You can't go after a man like that.

506
00:30:36,904 --> 00:30:38,153
Stop pursuing him.

507
00:30:40,161 --> 00:30:41,561
You don't understand anything.

508
00:30:43,562 --> 00:30:46,081
And I said that it was my friend, not me.

509
00:30:48,282 --> 00:30:49,682
Fine. Your friend.

510
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,691
Mr. Shi.

511
00:31:06,743 --> 00:31:08,143
I've heard so much about you.

512
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,326
You can write such powerful articles despite being so young, Miss Zheng.

513
00:31:22,618 --> 00:31:24,069
You are indeed very talented.

514
00:31:25,161 --> 00:31:26,561
You are too kind, Mr. Fan.

515
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,882
Mr. Fan, can I play some songs from my playlist?

516
00:31:34,122 --> 00:31:36,331
No problem. You can link your phone to the car via Bluetooth.

517
00:31:46,082 --> 00:31:49,692
What a coincidence. Mr. Shi loves listening to Song Yue Lan's songs too.

518
00:31:53,624 --> 00:31:56,016
(Shi Yan loves listening to Song Yue Lan's songs like me.)

519
00:31:56,097 --> 00:31:57,497
(What a coincidence.)

520
00:32:27,681 --> 00:32:28,957
(He didn't take advantage of me.)

521
00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:31,037
(He booked a separate room for me.)

522
00:32:31,177 --> 00:32:32,587
(That's Shi Yan.)

523
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,011
(I'm at the hotel already. Where are you?)

524
00:32:39,241 --> 00:32:42,433
- Come. Cheers.   - Let's cheer.

525
00:32:42,514 --> 00:32:43,914
Cheers.

526
00:32:52,122 --> 00:32:54,441
Mr. Shi, Miss Zheng is here. She has checked in.

527
00:32:56,283 --> 00:32:57,603
Comes to think of it,

528
00:32:57,684 --> 00:33:00,842
Mr. Shi and Mr. Yi are bound by fate.

529
00:33:02,449 --> 00:33:05,259
- What do you mean?   - Your partner

530
00:33:05,534 --> 00:33:08,601
is the technical consultant whom Mr. Shi went out of his way

531
00:33:08,681 --> 00:33:10,291
to invite to Le'an.

532
00:33:10,602 --> 00:33:13,042
But now, you can still sit at the same table

533
00:33:13,122 --> 00:33:16,051
to drink and have a chat together.

534
00:33:16,201 --> 00:33:17,282
All of us here

535
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:20,251
are unable to keep pace with the two of you.

536
00:33:21,481 --> 00:33:23,331
Come. Let's drink.

537
00:33:36,802 --> 00:33:38,331
Why aren't you replying to me yet?

538
00:33:41,865 --> 00:33:43,706
(You are the one who wants to bring me here.)

539
00:33:43,802 --> 00:33:46,212
(But now, you leave me all alone at the hotel.)

540
00:33:50,842 --> 00:33:52,613
(I haven't eaten dinner yet.)

541
00:33:57,721 --> 00:33:59,058
Huang.

542
00:33:59,401 --> 00:34:01,291
You were complimenting both of them.

543
00:34:02,161 --> 00:34:03,851
But the way you put it

544
00:34:04,122 --> 00:34:05,531
didn't sound nice at all.

545
00:34:05,873 --> 00:34:08,302
Mr. Shi and Mr. Yi are both magnanimous men.

546
00:34:08,456 --> 00:34:10,336
They won't hold a grudge against each other

547
00:34:10,482 --> 00:34:12,171
over a consultant.

548
00:34:14,297 --> 00:34:17,211
Actually, you didn't put it in a bad way.

549
00:34:17,442 --> 00:34:18,748
You put it in the wrong way.

550
00:34:21,641 --> 00:34:23,492
There's no enmity between me and Mr. Yi.

551
00:34:23,602 --> 00:34:25,761
Dark Horse and Le'an are just in healthy competition.

552
00:34:25,841 --> 00:34:27,241
I'm happy for him.

553
00:34:27,402 --> 00:34:29,522
As for Bruce, he has his own mindset.

554
00:34:29,602 --> 00:34:31,011
I respect his choice.

555
00:34:32,082 --> 00:34:34,211
Mr. Shi and I have a high regard for Bruce.

556
00:34:34,321 --> 00:34:37,412
Great minds think alike.

557
00:34:37,674 --> 00:34:39,564
Dark Horse and Le'an are competitors.

558
00:34:39,938 --> 00:34:42,577
But you can only improve when you have competitors.

559
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:44,372
As for Dark Horse and Yunchuang,

560
00:34:44,843 --> 00:34:46,834
maybe we'll have a chance to collaborate in the future.

561
00:34:47,122 --> 00:34:48,531
Am I right, Mr. Shi?

562
00:34:49,361 --> 00:34:51,772
Mr. Shi and Mr. Yi are really looking at the bigger picture.

563
00:34:51,863 --> 00:34:53,182
Since fate has brought us together,

564
00:34:53,281 --> 00:34:55,011
let us cheer for it.

565
00:34:56,002 --> 00:34:57,402
Cheers.

566
00:35:13,971 --> 00:35:16,239
I've read about your exclusive interview in the Financial Introduce.

567
00:35:16,801 --> 00:35:18,201
Really?

568
00:35:20,002 --> 00:35:21,611
That was indeed a great article.

569
00:35:22,428 --> 00:35:23,587
Forgive me for being frank.

570
00:35:23,678 --> 00:35:24,998
You are an extraordinary person.

571
00:35:25,137 --> 00:35:28,147
But Le'an doesn't have a leader who's capable enough.

572
00:35:28,963 --> 00:35:31,414
Chen Kang is a little bit indecisive.

573
00:35:31,562 --> 00:35:33,161
He cares too much about others' feelings.

574
00:35:33,241 --> 00:35:34,761
It'll cause him to overlook certain things.

575
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:37,561
It makes him unable to be prospective when he makes a decision.

576
00:35:37,641 --> 00:35:39,630
That's why it's hard for him to keep the talents he has.

577
00:35:41,922 --> 00:35:43,081
So?

578
00:35:43,161 --> 00:35:46,479
So, Dark Horse will definitely be the first

579
00:35:46,586 --> 00:35:48,585
to make a breakthrough with the mmWave

580
00:35:48,681 --> 00:35:50,081
in our country.

581
00:35:53,082 --> 00:35:54,482
Let's toast to Dark Horse then.

582
00:35:54,882 --> 00:35:56,282
Thank you.

583
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:01,649
(Some are having a feast.)

584
00:36:01,761 --> 00:36:03,651
(While some are starving.)

585
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,415
(I'm fine. I can do it.)

586
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,160
(I was busy.)

587
00:36:43,746 --> 00:36:45,146
Long time no see.

588
00:36:45,562 --> 00:36:48,012
I'm sorry, everyone. I have something else to take care of. I have to go.

589
00:36:59,761 --> 00:37:00,882
Mr. Shi.

590
00:37:00,962 --> 00:37:02,201
Let's go.

591
00:37:02,281 --> 00:37:03,482
Don't drink too much.

592
00:37:05,042 --> 00:37:06,442
Are you leaving already?

593
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,200
I have things to do. I'll be back later.

594
00:37:08,296 --> 00:37:09,696
What is it?

595
00:37:10,922 --> 00:37:12,322
I need to feed my cat.

596
00:37:13,281 --> 00:37:15,852
What? You brought your cat with you?

597
00:37:16,082 --> 00:37:17,359
It's so clingy.

598
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,291
It's a little bit fierce. It'll claw at me if I don't feed it on time.

599
00:37:32,761 --> 00:37:33,842
Mr. Fan.

600
00:37:33,922 --> 00:37:35,241
Mr. Shi drank a lot today.

601
00:37:35,321 --> 00:37:36,561
Drive slower.

602
00:37:36,641 --> 00:37:38,041
Okay.

603
00:37:38,641 --> 00:37:41,051
It's okay. Just drive at your usual speed.

604
00:37:42,241 --> 00:37:43,641
Okay, Mr. Shi.

605
00:38:01,002 --> 00:38:02,281
What are you doing?

606
00:38:02,361 --> 00:38:04,772
(I'm having the time of my life!)

607
00:38:05,281 --> 00:38:06,482
What did you say?

608
00:38:06,562 --> 00:38:10,412
I said, I'm having the time of my life!

609
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:29,674
Add more chilies for me.

610
00:38:29,841 --> 00:38:31,161
Okay. Do you want some spring onions?

611
00:38:31,256 --> 00:38:32,706
No. No spring onions.

612
00:38:37,161 --> 00:38:39,120
- Are you interested in her?   - Let's talk to her.

613
00:38:44,283 --> 00:38:46,439
Are you alone, pretty lady?

614
00:38:46,602 --> 00:38:49,412
- What is it?   - Let's have fun together. It's cold.

615
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,907
Let's drink together to warm up our bodies. Let's go.

616
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,420
Let go of me!

617
00:38:55,546 --> 00:38:56,585
Pretty lady.

618
00:38:56,681 --> 00:38:58,205
Are you having fun alone?

619
00:38:58,296 --> 00:39:00,922
Show me some respect and let's eat supper together.

620
00:39:01,041 --> 00:39:02,650
Yes. Let's be friends.

621
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:04,372
It's still early.

622
00:39:04,522 --> 00:39:06,322
We can go singing after we eat.

623
00:39:06,775 --> 00:39:08,055
Miss.

624
00:39:08,201 --> 00:39:09,762
Here are your skewers.

625
00:39:10,402 --> 00:39:13,291
- Go back early. Eat them while they are hot.   - Thank you.

626
00:39:14,883 --> 00:39:18,122
Don't go. Let's be friends. Come and sit with us.

627
00:39:18,218 --> 00:39:20,149
Let go of me!

628
00:39:26,427 --> 00:39:28,682
Who are you? Do you want me to hit you?

629
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,520
What are you doing?

630
00:40:03,659 --> 00:40:06,042
- Why did you go out alone at night?   - I went out to buy food.

631
00:40:06,122 --> 00:40:08,147
You asked me to come to Fucheng but you left me alone.

632
00:40:08,238 --> 00:40:10,309
After waiting the whole day, you replied that you were busy.

633
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:13,509
Then, you appeared suddenly and dragged me away without saying anything.

634
00:40:13,641 --> 00:40:15,041
Can't I buy my own food?

635
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,401
Do you have to wear something that's so nice to go out and buy food?

636
00:40:38,859 --> 00:40:41,201
Can't I do that? Are you going to dictate to me on that too?

637
00:40:42,241 --> 00:40:44,051
Don't you know how attractive you are?

638
00:40:52,714 --> 00:40:56,376
Have I attracted you?

639
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:03,707
Think before you answer.

640
00:41:13,922 --> 00:41:15,611
Just feel it and you'll know.

641
00:41:38,361 --> 00:41:39,761
What do you think?

642
00:41:50,449 --> 00:41:52,299
Hello. Excuse me.

643
00:42:07,801 --> 00:42:09,201
Zheng Shu Yi.

644
00:42:09,922 --> 00:42:11,892
Don't you know where your room is?

645
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,601
What's wrong with you?

646
00:42:19,522 --> 00:42:20,972
I'm thinking.

647
00:42:23,547 --> 00:42:24,947
I'm thinking

648
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,896
about whether or not you kissed me in the elevator just now.

649
00:42:30,241 --> 00:42:32,011
Can you do it again?

650
00:42:33,321 --> 00:42:35,922
I couldn't feel anything just now. Can you do it again?

651
00:42:36,042 --> 00:42:37,641
We can even retake our exam.

652
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:39,121
I want to retake my exam.

653
00:42:53,778 --> 00:42:55,178
Go back and sleep.

654
00:43:00,962 --> 00:43:02,482
Are you really not going to do it again?

655
00:43:02,585 --> 00:43:04,955
I didn't feel anything just now.
