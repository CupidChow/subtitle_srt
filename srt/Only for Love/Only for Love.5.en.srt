00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,917
(Only For Love)

2
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,082
(Episode 5)

3
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:47,402
Thank you.

4
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,681
Who would have thought to have an interview at a horse ranch?

5
00:02:01,068 --> 00:02:04,189
This horse lover is not just all talk.

6
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,979
Hello, Mr. Guan.

7
00:02:15,079 --> 00:02:17,299
Is this your horse? It looks pretty.

8
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,990
Miss Xu, you have good taste.

9
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,525
Do you want to change into riding clothes and take a few laps?

10
00:02:22,606 --> 00:02:24,479
No, thank you. It's so kind of you.

11
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,269
Let's start the interview.

12
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,479
I think this place isn't very suitable.

13
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,082
What about I take you out for a cup of coffee?

14
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,760
I have coffee here too.

15
00:02:35,841 --> 00:02:37,021
It tastes pretty good.

16
00:02:41,097 --> 00:02:42,847
Alright, Mr. Guan. Let's begin.

17
00:02:44,753 --> 00:02:46,712
Excuse me. I have to take this call.

18
00:02:46,847 --> 00:02:47,847
Okay.

19
00:02:49,897 --> 00:02:50,897
Hello?

20
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:52,479
Guan Ji.

21
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,920
Guan Ji, come and save me.

22
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,360
My uncle has thrown me in jail.

23
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,360
(I'll never be happy again.)

24
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,880
Yue, I'm telling you.

25
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,750
Just take it as it comes.

26
00:03:04,863 --> 00:03:07,264
It seems Shi Yan is serious this time.

27
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,520
You do know that once he makes up his mind,

28
00:03:09,601 --> 00:03:10,862
nobody can change it.

29
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,799
(Shi Yan?)

30
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,362
(Maybe Guan Ji is the key to this.)

31
00:03:24,151 --> 00:03:25,331
(Guan Ji.)

32
00:03:25,434 --> 00:03:27,682
(Do you think me...)

33
00:03:27,827 --> 00:03:28,910
Me.

34
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:32,442
Am I someone who has anything to do with work?

35
00:03:32,576 --> 00:03:34,847
I've never worked before.

36
00:03:35,038 --> 00:03:36,518
But even if you don't work,

37
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,419
Shi Yan won't let you stay at home.

38
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:40,898
Just stay calm.

39
00:03:41,176 --> 00:03:43,088
Think of it as surfing the internet at another place.

40
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,799
(Play with your phone.)

41
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,320
(Time will pass quickly.)

42
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,922
Is there no other way?

43
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:53,068
I don't want to waste my youth here.

44
00:03:54,155 --> 00:03:55,535
Princess Yue.

45
00:03:55,618 --> 00:03:57,882
You should face the truth and give up your fantasies.

46
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,299
But since I feel sorry for you, let me give you a word of advice.

47
00:04:01,401 --> 00:04:05,045
Since you can't handle Shi Yan, why not try something else?

48
00:04:05,432 --> 00:04:07,026
(Alright. I have something else to do. We'll talk later.)

49
00:04:07,107 --> 00:04:08,482
What do you mean?

50
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,907
Hey.

51
00:04:13,175 --> 00:04:14,616
(I can't handle Shi Yan.)

52
00:04:14,697 --> 00:04:17,057
(But there's no way I can't handle this horse lover.)

53
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,829
(Is it only Zheng Shu Yi who can achieve things through these means?)

54
00:04:24,337 --> 00:04:26,820
Mr. Guan, let's continue.

55
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:29,140
Okay.

56
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,321
Industry insiders all praise you for being young and capable.

57
00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:38,775
And I heard you are about to take over Guan Capital soon.

58
00:04:38,856 --> 00:04:41,175
I'm sure there will be many big moves afterward.

59
00:04:41,256 --> 00:04:43,166
Can you reveal something to me now?

60
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:47,640
Guan Capital still maintains the established industrial pattern

61
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,269
while making some innovations.

62
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:53,282
Mr. Guan, you really have a unique vision.

63
00:04:53,363 --> 00:04:55,884
In the future,

64
00:04:56,033 --> 00:04:59,230
have you considered bringing in more talent?

65
00:05:00,665 --> 00:05:02,344
In fact, the competition of any enterprise

66
00:05:02,447 --> 00:05:04,947
is fundamentally a competition of talent.

67
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,279
For a company like Guan Capital,

68
00:05:06,398 --> 00:05:07,949
it is even more eager to seek talent.

69
00:05:08,368 --> 00:05:11,509
We will always open our doors to excellent talent

70
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,099
at any time.

71
00:05:24,231 --> 00:05:25,901
Thank you for your sharing, Mr. Guan.

72
00:05:31,161 --> 00:05:32,221
Mr. Guan,

73
00:05:32,578 --> 00:05:35,722
I have a personal question for you.

74
00:05:37,257 --> 00:05:39,006
(When reporters ask me for contact information, )

75
00:05:39,087 --> 00:05:41,587
(they always say it's to confirm the draft.)

76
00:05:43,897 --> 00:05:45,057
I don't know

77
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:47,466
if it's inconvenient for you to leave your contact information.

78
00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:50,122
It's just for confirming the draft later.

79
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,720
Mr. Guan, your horse really is a champion among horses.

80
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:02,220
It's so full of character.

81
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,682
No, it's just a bit impatient.

82
00:06:06,817 --> 00:06:07,856
Miss Xu.

83
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:10,332
It's an honor to accept your interview. I still have something to do here.

84
00:06:10,428 --> 00:06:11,973
I'll arrange for someone to take you back.

85
00:06:12,054 --> 00:06:13,475
Thank you, Mr. Guan.

86
00:06:15,783 --> 00:06:17,199
(As expected, he's a spoiled rich boy)

87
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,160
(who only knows how to ride horses and flirt with girls.)

88
00:06:19,239 --> 00:06:22,589
(If it weren't for your father, you wouldn't be anything.)

89
00:06:25,007 --> 00:06:26,927
(Since you can't handle Shi Yan, )

90
00:06:27,007 --> 00:06:28,997
(why not try something else?)

91
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,453
Try something else?

92
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,162
How?

93
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,661
Mr. Shi.

94
00:06:59,936 --> 00:07:02,870
I've already found out where Lieying's funds come from.

95
00:07:03,321 --> 00:07:04,542
It's Mingyu.

96
00:07:06,178 --> 00:07:07,598
You already know?

97
00:07:09,705 --> 00:07:11,802
I didn't know before, but now I do.

98
00:07:11,883 --> 00:07:15,342
So, what should we do now?

99
00:07:15,911 --> 00:07:17,602
Whether Mingyu lends the money or not is up to him.

100
00:07:17,696 --> 00:07:19,555
We just have to do our own part.

101
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,522
Would you like to give Mr. Qin a call?

102
00:07:25,204 --> 00:07:27,160
In terms of social customs, Lieying has helped Mingyu in the past.

103
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:29,149
A drop of water should be repaid with a spring.

104
00:07:29,312 --> 00:07:32,282
In terms of reason, Mingyu won't do a business that loses money.

105
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:34,204
The fact that they lent the money to Lieying

106
00:07:34,361 --> 00:07:36,081
means this deal is profitable.

107
00:07:36,218 --> 00:07:38,047
What reason do we have to stop it?

108
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,642
Shu Yi. This is your team's intern.

109
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,642
Get to know each other first.

110
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,663
Hello. My name is Zheng Shu Yi. Nice to work with you.

111
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,442
Hello. My name is Qin Shi Yue. Please guide me.

112
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,080
This is your seat. Put your things down and tidy up.

113
00:08:11,161 --> 00:08:12,300
Okay.

114
00:08:46,441 --> 00:08:50,485
The new intern has been playing with her phone for over an hour.

115
00:08:50,578 --> 00:08:54,322
I can see she's a bit lost. Why don't you arrange something for her to do?

116
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,980
Lost?

117
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:58,549
I can see she's having fun.

118
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,696
Shu Yi, this is my gift to you.

119
00:09:59,778 --> 00:10:01,482
I don't know anything since I just started working.

120
00:10:01,593 --> 00:10:03,303
Please take care of me in the future.

121
00:10:06,642 --> 00:10:08,202
No need for the gift.

122
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,379
In the next few months,

123
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,539
if you don't understand anything, feel free to ask me.

124
00:10:12,864 --> 00:10:15,285
Let me give you some work to do first.

125
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,179
Now?

126
00:10:18,671 --> 00:10:22,332
(Excuse me. People should be polite when they receive a gift.)

127
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:24,442
(Why do you have to assign me work?)

128
00:10:25,728 --> 00:10:29,442
This recorder has an interview recording of me from some time ago.

129
00:10:29,574 --> 00:10:33,254
Listen to it and organize the questions and answers.

130
00:10:33,345 --> 00:10:34,345
Try to come out with a draft.

131
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:35,686
Give it to me before you leave.

132
00:10:36,617 --> 00:10:37,837
Okay.

133
00:11:00,841 --> 00:11:02,062
SY?

134
00:11:02,289 --> 00:11:03,589
How coincidental.

135
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,584
(I know how to take notes.)

136
00:11:06,672 --> 00:11:08,552
(It's not English, just Chinese.)

137
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:10,710
(I can just listen to it a few more times.)

138
00:11:26,248 --> 00:11:27,609
(Will the cooperation between Yunchuang)

139
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,370
(and Guan Capital be officially announced soon?)

140
00:11:29,451 --> 00:11:33,432
(Next, will you both enter the fields of mutual interest?)

141
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:36,122
(Why do you think Guan Capital would collaborate with Yunchuang?)

142
00:11:36,251 --> 00:11:39,002
(What do you think Guan Capital and Yunchuang will do together?)

143
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:40,722
(Uncle?)

144
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,750
(How is this an interview?)

145
00:11:44,185 --> 00:11:45,505
(Isn't this just chatting?)

146
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,539
(Where are the corresponding questions and answers?)

147
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,149
(Two hours?)

148
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,880
(How could he talk for so long?)

149
00:11:55,961 --> 00:11:58,671
(He usually doesn't speak much.)

150
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:16,802
Hello. Mr. Chen. Help me, please.

151
00:12:19,785 --> 00:12:21,585
Okay. Got it, Miss Qin.

152
00:12:21,687 --> 00:12:23,558
I'll try to find time to help you organize it.

153
00:12:23,689 --> 00:12:24,690
Please hurry.

154
00:12:24,771 --> 00:12:28,001
I have to submit it before I get off work. Thank you so much.

155
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:32,029
(If you do it again, you'll come to work with Chen Sheng.)

156
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,145
The whole contract follows the procedure...

157
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:51,225
Mr. Shi, please wait. Mr. Shi, you can't go in.

158
00:12:51,306 --> 00:12:53,525
Sorry, both of you. I've come in without an invitation.

159
00:12:55,633 --> 00:12:57,512
Mr. Shi, long time no see.

160
00:12:57,593 --> 00:12:59,402
Is there something you suddenly came for?

161
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,619
I'll finish talking with Mr. Chen first. We'll talk later.

162
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:04,797
Since business means business,

163
00:13:04,878 --> 00:13:06,760
I'm not here to stop you two from negotiating your terms.

164
00:13:06,841 --> 00:13:10,002
But Mr. Chen, I still want to give you a sincere suggestion.

165
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:13,042
Don't lose the original intention and the future of Le'an

166
00:13:13,161 --> 00:13:15,230
for the sake of short-term benefits.

167
00:13:19,504 --> 00:13:20,644
Mr. Shi,

168
00:13:21,275 --> 00:13:22,822
I don't know how long I can hold on,

169
00:13:22,961 --> 00:13:25,042
but this money is too important to us.

170
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:26,704
Mr. Shi,

171
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:29,470
you know the source of this fund.

172
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:33,315
Chen Kang, do you know what interest rate Mingyu asks of you?

173
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:35,556
It's three points higher than the normal rate.

174
00:13:35,637 --> 00:13:37,597
This means that once you accept this money,

175
00:13:37,678 --> 00:13:39,882
you will bear the interest with Lieying.

176
00:13:39,969 --> 00:13:42,362
Your technical achievements will be monetized as soon as possible.

177
00:13:42,573 --> 00:13:44,807
Technology research and development will also lose its sustainability.

178
00:13:44,898 --> 00:13:47,824
Mr. Shi, don't say that.

179
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:50,588
Lieying and Yunchuang value Le'an's technology.

180
00:13:50,713 --> 00:13:53,303
We want to collaborate with Le'an on research and development.

181
00:13:53,384 --> 00:13:56,378
Once Le'an is acquired, you will lose your voice.

182
00:13:56,459 --> 00:13:59,921
You and your team will be jointly responsible for this large loan.

183
00:14:00,002 --> 00:14:01,096
Once this happens, how will you

184
00:14:01,177 --> 00:14:03,456
and your team devote yourselves to solving technical problems?

185
00:14:05,431 --> 00:14:06,951
Chip technology is a blue ocean industry.

186
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:09,950
I hope you don't make a wrong decision impulsively.

187
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:12,140
Mr. Shi.

188
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:15,071
Our whole team has worked so hard for so many years.

189
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,338
Everyone is looking forward to the results,

190
00:14:17,419 --> 00:14:19,889
but also hoping to have a decent life.

191
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,030
I really get along with you,

192
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:25,725
but...

193
00:14:34,153 --> 00:14:37,113
I have made a long-term plan for Le'an in this period of time.

194
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,688
I have planned a fund pool

195
00:14:38,769 --> 00:14:41,880
which can provide funds for Le'an's R&D in stages.

196
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,200
Of course, with the premise that you have the confidence

197
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,780
to keep the R&D effort continuously.

198
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:51,904
Today, I can promise you that if Yunchuang invests in Le'an,

199
00:14:51,985 --> 00:14:53,905
the independence, strategy, promises to employees,

200
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,639
and organizational framework of Le'an Technology

201
00:14:56,719 --> 00:14:58,400
will remain unchanged.

202
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,908
In short, Yunchuang's investment

203
00:14:59,988 --> 00:15:02,562
won't interfere with or interrupt Le'an's development.

204
00:15:02,657 --> 00:15:04,858
I hope you make the best decision for your team

205
00:15:04,944 --> 00:15:07,174
while also adhering to your original intention of starting a business.

206
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,669
This... I...

207
00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:20,628
Mr. Chen.

208
00:15:21,057 --> 00:15:24,007
Do you know what the prerequisite is for attracting an investor?

209
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,995
It's not the price. It's not the monetization path.

210
00:15:26,105 --> 00:15:28,605
There is an even more important condition.

211
00:15:29,864 --> 00:15:30,865
What is it?

212
00:15:30,968 --> 00:15:32,682
A clear-headed manager.

213
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:35,318
Talent is the most important factor for a company.

214
00:15:35,664 --> 00:15:37,345
You haven't reached the end of the road yet.

215
00:15:37,456 --> 00:15:40,615
I hope you don't bury everything you have built with your own hands.

216
00:15:40,696 --> 00:15:42,537
As long as you are willing to persist,

217
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,590
there are infinite possibilities for Le'an.

218
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,029
Recently, a journalist said the same thing to me.

219
00:15:53,729 --> 00:15:54,750
Mr. Shi.

220
00:15:55,128 --> 00:15:56,718
I'm willing to give you some time

221
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:58,389
and also give myself some time.

222
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:01,509
Maybe Le'an will have other choices.

223
00:16:04,319 --> 00:16:05,740
Sorry, Mr. Li.

224
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,762
Thank you for your and Lieying's generosity.

225
00:16:08,042 --> 00:16:11,710
I think I still need some time to consider our cooperation.

226
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,939
I'm really sorry.

227
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,869
It's over. I worked so hard to write this draft.

228
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,294
Shu Yi.

229
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,981
Shu Yi.

230
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,899
Shu Yi.

231
00:17:18,401 --> 00:17:20,111
Why is she like this?

232
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:29,927
(If you do it again, you'll come to work with Chen Sheng.)

233
00:17:54,337 --> 00:17:55,698
Let me introduce you to everyone.

234
00:17:55,779 --> 00:17:58,642
This is Cheng Bei Er, our new intern who joined today.

235
00:17:58,723 --> 00:18:00,403
Everyone, please take care of her.

236
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:01,916
Hello everyone.

237
00:18:02,044 --> 00:18:03,096
She's so young.

238
00:18:03,177 --> 00:18:05,023
I heard she graduated from a prestigious college.

239
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:07,720
(She's really a clean girl.)

240
00:18:07,801 --> 00:18:09,882
(She just doesn't like to work.)

241
00:18:12,097 --> 00:18:13,117
Shu Yi.

242
00:18:13,256 --> 00:18:16,442
Where is your intern? Why isn't she here to greet everyone?

243
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:20,650
- She got off work.   - So early?

244
00:18:20,987 --> 00:18:22,280
It's time to get off work.

245
00:18:22,361 --> 00:18:23,821
So, she left naturally.

246
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,002
Bei Er, let's go.

247
00:18:27,129 --> 00:18:28,720
Let's get back to work.

248
00:18:28,999 --> 00:18:30,040
Let's go.

249
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,362
- Wait for me. I'll tidy up.   - Okay.

250
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:40,256
I heard about this Cheng Bei Er.

251
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,149
She graduated from the top media college in the country.

252
00:18:44,376 --> 00:18:45,816
She was first in her major

253
00:18:45,897 --> 00:18:48,087
and won the national award for three consecutive years.

254
00:18:48,207 --> 00:18:49,807
She also has a degree in finance.

255
00:18:49,903 --> 00:18:51,693
She even won an award for her thesis.

256
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:54,802
Compared to that spoiled rich girl...

257
00:18:55,088 --> 00:18:57,278
I don't feel dissatisfied at all.

258
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,242
Their family members are all in finance.

259
00:19:01,363 --> 00:19:03,994
Her aunt seems to be a senior executive at Mingyu.

260
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,082
This intern has such an impressive background,

261
00:19:08,163 --> 00:19:09,602
and she works so hard.

262
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:11,802
She even worked overtime on the first day of her internship.

263
00:19:13,345 --> 00:19:15,215
It put so much pressure on me.

264
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,122
As long as I don't compare myself to her,

265
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:22,779
I won't be hurt.

266
00:19:26,223 --> 00:19:28,264
Come, eat more meat to increase your protein.

267
00:19:28,345 --> 00:19:29,904
- Okay.   - And this.

268
00:19:29,985 --> 00:19:31,266
You like to eat this, right?

269
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,779
Eat more.

270
00:19:32,999 --> 00:19:34,882
- Grandpa, you don't even know...   - What happened?

271
00:19:34,978 --> 00:19:37,802
- I was so exhausted today.   - Really?

272
00:19:37,883 --> 00:19:39,562
I almost died from exhaustion.

273
00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:41,019
Dad, I'm back.

274
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:42,620
Hurry and eat.

275
00:19:52,187 --> 00:19:53,562
The person who is almost dead from exhaustion

276
00:19:53,643 --> 00:19:55,514
is still eating with such enthusiasm.

277
00:19:57,714 --> 00:20:00,504
Grandpa, look at him.

278
00:20:01,289 --> 00:20:03,088
I worked so hard all-day

279
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:04,849
and Uncle still wants to give me a hard time.

280
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,411
He won't even let me eat now.

281
00:20:06,492 --> 00:20:08,832
Do you think I'm his real niece?

282
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,590
Is it right to not eat when it's time to eat?

283
00:20:13,032 --> 00:20:15,835
Don't bring your work personalities back home

284
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,962
and treat your own niece like this.

285
00:20:18,649 --> 00:20:20,362
Grandpa, you love me the most.

286
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,089
He may not be related to me in blood,

287
00:20:22,201 --> 00:20:24,802
but you are definitely blood-related, Grandpa.

288
00:20:28,298 --> 00:20:29,722
Oh, right, Shi Yan.

289
00:20:29,803 --> 00:20:31,282
I was just about to ask you

290
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,781
why did you

291
00:20:33,434 --> 00:20:36,550
suddenly arrange for her to be a journalist?

292
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,522
She's graduated and should be working now.

293
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,760
She can't do anything else,

294
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,359
so Uncle Guan asked his friend

295
00:20:43,439 --> 00:20:45,962
to let her intern at a magazine company for a while.

296
00:20:51,074 --> 00:20:52,784
How did it go today at work?

297
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:55,743
Didn't you hear it all?

298
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:58,270
Two hours of recording and I have to type it all out.

299
00:20:58,351 --> 00:20:59,992
I'm not a typist.

300
00:21:00,073 --> 00:21:01,793
When I heard about the interview, I thought,

301
00:21:01,874 --> 00:21:05,064
what kind of interview is that? It's just a chat.

302
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,870
They asked you to type?

303
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:11,229
Who is your superior?

304
00:21:11,768 --> 00:21:13,838
It's Miss Zheng, a woman.

305
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,799
Zheng Shu Yi.

306
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,590
Yes, that's her.

307
00:21:33,593 --> 00:21:35,434
Since she's arranged the job for you, just do it well.

308
00:21:35,515 --> 00:21:39,344
Since she is your superior, be humble and learn from her.

309
00:21:41,529 --> 00:21:43,209
That's what I thought too.

310
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:45,159
But, is she willing to teach me?

311
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:47,170
Why do you say that?

312
00:21:47,738 --> 00:21:49,038
I thought,

313
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:51,642
if I don't understand a thing, I could just ask, right?

314
00:21:52,066 --> 00:21:54,825
But today, I wanted to ask her something several times,

315
00:21:54,928 --> 00:21:55,976
and she didn't even look at me.

316
00:21:56,057 --> 00:21:57,847
She completely ignored me.

317
00:21:58,024 --> 00:21:59,383
I thought she was busy with work,

318
00:21:59,464 --> 00:22:01,344
so I thought I'd ask her after work.

319
00:22:01,425 --> 00:22:03,038
But after waiting for more than half an hour,

320
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:04,438
I was about to leave,

321
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:06,310
and she didn't look at me.

322
00:22:07,792 --> 00:22:12,270
Isn't it wrong to bully a newbie like this?

323
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,030
Let's eat, Dad.

324
00:22:19,577 --> 00:22:23,326
(Did Uncle understand my cry for help?)

325
00:22:25,626 --> 00:22:27,616
Why are there so many people today?

326
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,641
Go in. Hurry.

327
00:22:29,792 --> 00:22:31,242
Get in and have a seat.

328
00:22:31,506 --> 00:22:32,802
Have a seat.

329
00:22:32,959 --> 00:22:33,979
Have a seat.

330
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,560
This is Mr. Guan from Guan Capital.

331
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,879
We often played together back then.

332
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:39,119
Hello, Mr. Guan.

333
00:22:39,199 --> 00:22:40,580
Let's get to know each other.

334
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,118
Come, Mr. Guan. Have a drink.

335
00:22:49,214 --> 00:22:50,355
Come, Mr. Guan.

336
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:55,119
Mr. Guan. Let's add each other on WeChat.

337
00:22:55,199 --> 00:22:56,624
Let's go out and play together later.

338
00:22:56,705 --> 00:22:58,254
Yeah, let's add each other.

339
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,350
I...

340
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,042
I was wondering why you haven't come out after so long.

341
00:23:03,128 --> 00:23:04,878
I've been waiting for you in the car for half a day.

342
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,380
Sorry, babe.

343
00:23:07,946 --> 00:23:09,365
I have to go first.

344
00:23:19,817 --> 00:23:22,077
Are you not happy because I'm too popular with the girls?

345
00:23:23,983 --> 00:23:25,984
I just understand the feeling of being pestered

346
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,639
by someone whom you have no feelings.

347
00:23:27,719 --> 00:23:30,709
So I came to your rescue and got you out of the situation.

348
00:23:31,616 --> 00:23:33,405
How did you know I didn't have feelings for them?

349
00:23:35,439 --> 00:23:37,270
So, was I just meddling in your business?

350
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,580
I'll go first.

351
00:23:40,479 --> 00:23:41,739
I'll see you off.

352
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:46,362
You still have so many female companions whom you have feelings for.

353
00:23:46,719 --> 00:23:48,140
No need to trouble yourself.

354
00:23:49,503 --> 00:23:51,762
I only have one female companion,

355
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,179
which is you.

356
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:16,085
Done.

357
00:24:42,562 --> 00:24:44,200
(The draft has been reviewed by me and the editor-in-chief.)

358
00:24:44,271 --> 00:24:45,272
(No issues at all.)

359
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,399
(It has been sent to Shi Yan.)

360
00:24:46,479 --> 00:24:47,762
(We're waiting for his reply.)

361
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,219
(It's well written.)

362
00:24:51,273 --> 00:24:53,062
Thank you, Editor and Editor-in-Chief.

363
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,149
It would be great if I could add Shi Yan on WeChat.

364
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:07,870
I don't know if the special report will fly.

365
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,300
It would be great if I could ask him directly.

366
00:25:15,887 --> 00:25:16,887
Dad.

367
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,259
Have some tea.

368
00:25:19,841 --> 00:25:23,229
I heard you went horseback riding this weekend

369
00:25:24,239 --> 00:25:26,070
and brought a girl with you.

370
00:25:29,247 --> 00:25:32,197
Guan said you haven't been there for a long time.

371
00:25:32,688 --> 00:25:34,358
Have you been busy with work lately?

372
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:38,919
I'm busy with the Le'an Technology matter.

373
00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:42,949
I heard something about it.

374
00:25:44,483 --> 00:25:47,590
Xiao Ming is also busy with Lieying's matter.

375
00:25:48,289 --> 00:25:49,734
I know. Before I had dinner,

376
00:25:49,815 --> 00:25:51,322
I just came back from Le'an Technology.

377
00:25:51,443 --> 00:25:53,164
Mingyu's efficiency is really high.

378
00:25:53,296 --> 00:25:54,640
When I went there in the afternoon,

379
00:25:54,729 --> 00:25:56,279
Lieying had already talked to them.

380
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:59,457
Do I need to talk to your brother-in-law?

381
00:26:00,177 --> 00:26:02,458
He was supposed to come back for dinner today,

382
00:26:02,639 --> 00:26:05,429
but he had to go deal with Lieying's matter.

383
00:26:08,514 --> 00:26:09,793
Business means business.

384
00:26:09,888 --> 00:26:12,032
The interest rate Lieying offered is indeed attractive.

385
00:26:12,129 --> 00:26:14,722
There's no problem with what Brother-in-law did. I understand him.

386
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,459
In other words,

387
00:26:16,714 --> 00:26:20,624
if Le'an Technology is attracted by Lieying's acquisition fund,

388
00:26:20,753 --> 00:26:21,953
then I need to re-evaluate

389
00:26:22,034 --> 00:26:25,630
if this company is the one I want to cooperate with in the long run.

390
00:26:28,329 --> 00:26:33,002
Mingyu has been established for 23 years now.

391
00:26:34,042 --> 00:26:35,992
Your uncles back then were also very insightful.

392
00:26:36,239 --> 00:26:39,949
They have business minds and the means to achieve their goals.

393
00:26:40,352 --> 00:26:42,822
They also value loyalty,

394
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,749
accompanying Mingyu through the storms and waves.

395
00:26:46,927 --> 00:26:48,437
Sometimes,

396
00:26:49,113 --> 00:26:53,041
you have to listen to their ideas.

397
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,830
At this stage of yours,

398
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,311
you still need to keep learning and strengthening yourself.

399
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,630
Even if their ideas are different from yours,

400
00:27:02,841 --> 00:27:06,880
and they can't become a help to your career, still,

401
00:27:06,961 --> 00:27:09,641
you shouldn't let them become

402
00:27:09,722 --> 00:27:12,672
an obstacle on your path forward.

403
00:27:13,719 --> 00:27:14,839
I understand, Dad.

404
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,261
It's getting late.

405
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:18,068
Please go back earlier.

406
00:27:18,719 --> 00:27:19,860
Thank you, Dad.

407
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,749
Then, I'll go back first.

408
00:27:23,439 --> 00:27:25,459
- Get some rest early, Dad.   - Okay.

409
00:27:54,688 --> 00:27:55,808
Professor Yu.

410
00:27:55,896 --> 00:27:57,376
Do you have time in two days?

411
00:27:57,457 --> 00:27:59,018
(I'm going rock climbing in two days.)

412
00:27:59,099 --> 00:28:00,888
(Do you want to relax together?)

413
00:28:00,969 --> 00:28:02,108
Rock climbing?

414
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,991
Are you sure this is relaxing?

415
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:06,219
Can you send me the address?

416
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:07,660
(No problem.)

417
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:53,270
The draft was approved so quickly?

418
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,060
Wasn't it sent last night?

419
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,520
The editor-in-chief and editor replied last night.

420
00:28:59,632 --> 00:29:02,182
They were both satisfied. It has been sent to Yunchuang.

421
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:07,802
(Uncle, it's time to prove that you are my uncle.)

422
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,140
Good morning, Shi Yue.

423
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,660
Good morning.

424
00:29:19,118 --> 00:29:21,280
Miss Tian. Please help me with this. Is it okay to write it this way?

425
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,360
Let me see.

426
00:29:22,825 --> 00:29:24,186
What should I do with regard to this?

427
00:29:24,282 --> 00:29:25,362
Yue.

428
00:29:25,529 --> 00:29:27,449
Don't eat breakfast so quickly.

429
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:29,080
It's easy to get indigestion.

430
00:29:36,769 --> 00:29:41,168
How about it? Did Mingyu appreciate your draft?

431
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:52,882
Why isn't it approved?

432
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,189
And, it didn't say if there's anything wrong with it. What does that mean?

433
00:29:57,190 --> 00:30:00,140
(Uncle loves me like a mountain loves the snow.)

434
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:48,002
Shu Yi. You guys don't need to report on the topic for this week yet.

435
00:30:48,164 --> 00:30:50,002
Let's first finish the draft for Shi Yan.

436
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,039
Yu Ling, weren't you the one who interviewed Guan Ji before?

437
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,881
Be prepared, you can take over anytime.

438
00:30:55,048 --> 00:30:56,322
Okay, Editor.

439
00:30:56,711 --> 00:30:59,470
Shu Yi, I can tell your recent status isn't so good.

440
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,040
Your body is the capital of the revolution.

441
00:31:01,121 --> 00:31:02,710
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

442
00:31:02,801 --> 00:31:04,670
Alright, meeting adjourned.

443
00:31:06,199 --> 00:31:08,580
Shu Yi, you stay behind.

444
00:31:14,887 --> 00:31:16,367
What's going on?

445
00:31:16,479 --> 00:31:20,149
Did something unpleasant happen when you were interviewing him?

446
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,499
No, it shouldn't be.

447
00:31:23,505 --> 00:31:24,864
It should be me who was unhappy.

448
00:31:24,945 --> 00:31:27,026
I was almost thrown off the horse.

449
00:31:27,107 --> 00:31:28,737
What did he have to be unhappy about?

450
00:31:30,279 --> 00:31:32,160
What was the situation?

451
00:31:32,248 --> 00:31:35,202
Until now, there haven't been any clear revision suggestions.

452
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,639
You should communicate with Yunchuang and get it sorted out.

453
00:31:38,719 --> 00:31:42,580
Let them give some clear opinions and fix it quickly.

454
00:31:42,695 --> 00:31:43,995
Got it.

455
00:31:44,817 --> 00:31:47,217
After all, this is Shi Yan's first time being interviewed.

456
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,042
We don't know him well enough.

457
00:31:49,123 --> 00:31:51,073
Maybe he has his own requirements.

458
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,159
You still have to try your best to make him satisfied.

459
00:31:54,239 --> 00:31:56,310
The deadline is coming soon.

460
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,459
If it doesn't work,

461
00:31:58,768 --> 00:32:00,288
you can send him a message through WeChat,

462
00:32:00,384 --> 00:32:01,863
say a few nice words

463
00:32:01,944 --> 00:32:03,535
and ask Shi Yan himself.

464
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,939
What's wrong?

465
00:32:09,192 --> 00:32:10,473
Are you shy?

466
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,189
This isn't like you.

467
00:32:13,256 --> 00:32:15,096
I'm not shy at all.

468
00:32:15,191 --> 00:32:16,532
It's just that I don't have his WeChat.

469
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,739
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

470
00:32:22,384 --> 00:32:24,104
Here's Shi Yan's phone number.

471
00:32:24,239 --> 00:32:25,540
I'll send it to you.

472
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,920
You can ask him.

473
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,499
Speak nicely to him.

474
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,669
Get it sorted out, okay?

475
00:32:38,482 --> 00:32:40,282
How did I offend him?

476
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,377
Even if I offended him, work is work.

477
00:32:44,514 --> 00:32:46,143
He shouldn't be so petty, right?

478
00:32:58,218 --> 00:32:59,317
Come here.

479
00:33:42,896 --> 00:33:46,189
I didn't expect you to be so good at rock climbing.

480
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,820
Let's go.

481
00:34:01,719 --> 00:34:04,630
So, you're competing with your parent company now?

482
00:34:05,392 --> 00:34:06,613
Not entirely.

483
00:34:07,152 --> 00:34:09,279
Once Mingyu lends this money to Lieying,

484
00:34:09,416 --> 00:34:11,615
no matter if Lieying acquires Le'an or not,

485
00:34:11,696 --> 00:34:14,156
it has to pay back the principal and interest to Mingyu.

486
00:34:14,417 --> 00:34:15,417
In principle,

487
00:34:15,505 --> 00:34:17,202
the competition between Yunchuang and Lieying

488
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,480
won't harm the interests of the parent company.

489
00:34:19,658 --> 00:34:20,739
In the long run,

490
00:34:20,905 --> 00:34:22,025
Yunchuang investing in Le'an

491
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,749
will also be profitable for Mingyu.

492
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:28,149
So, you want me to help you contact Bruce?

493
00:34:28,672 --> 00:34:30,793
Yes. I've looked into his background.

494
00:34:30,905 --> 00:34:33,184
You two were in the same college and were colleagues.

495
00:34:33,265 --> 00:34:35,896
So, I'm counting on you to help me with this.

496
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,440
Actually, it's not hard to contact him.

497
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,162
But it's quite difficult to get him to join Le'an.

498
00:34:41,296 --> 00:34:43,417
From what I know, many companies, both domestic and foreign,

499
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,919
have offered him high conditions to invite him,

500
00:34:46,115 --> 00:34:48,379
but none of them have been able to attract him.

501
00:34:48,723 --> 00:34:52,424
He always felt that in the college's research lab, he could be more focused

502
00:34:52,553 --> 00:34:54,383
and get more inspiration.

503
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:57,402
So, if this matter is important to you,

504
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,709
my suggestion is to consider other experts in the field.

505
00:35:02,929 --> 00:35:04,402
When it comes to millimeter wave communication,

506
00:35:04,483 --> 00:35:06,530
Professor Bruce is very authoritative.

507
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,319
Regarding the problem Le'an is facing now, if he can't solve it,

508
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:11,159
it would be hard for others to solve it too.

509
00:35:11,365 --> 00:35:14,679
Moreover, breaking through this technical problem is of great significance,

510
00:35:14,759 --> 00:35:17,189
not only from a business perspective.

511
00:35:18,352 --> 00:35:19,983
Since you said so,

512
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:21,694
I'll try my best.

513
00:35:23,016 --> 00:35:24,175
I'm deeply moved.

514
00:35:24,263 --> 00:35:25,813
I shall await your good news.

515
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,120
Sure.

516
00:35:28,399 --> 00:35:31,100
Do you want to race to the top again?

517
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,482
Sure, why not? I won't let you win this time.

518
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:03,639
(Hello, Mr. Shi. I'm Zheng Shu Yi.)

519
00:36:03,759 --> 00:36:04,880
(I'm sorry to disturb you.)

520
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,799
(I have some questions about this draft.)

521
00:36:07,879 --> 00:36:09,962
(Hope to hear from you soon. Thank you.)

522
00:36:34,177 --> 00:36:38,087
Is he on mute or on do not disturb mode?

523
00:36:39,279 --> 00:36:40,910
Or did he block me?

524
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,829
Or, does he not answer unknown calls?

525
00:36:47,088 --> 00:36:48,888
I have a phone worth thousands of dollars

526
00:36:48,969 --> 00:36:50,919
but I still can't get a reply from him.

527
00:36:51,097 --> 00:36:52,517
Why am I still keeping you?

528
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,259
Mr. Chen,

529
00:37:10,184 --> 00:37:13,030
can you help me and tell Mr. Shi something on my behalf?

530
00:37:13,529 --> 00:37:16,608
It's like this. I have some private urgent matters

531
00:37:16,704 --> 00:37:18,282
and I want to find him.

532
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,759
(Mr. Shi is busy. When he's done, I'll go talk to him first.)

533
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,282
(Then, I'll get back to you.)

534
00:37:23,759 --> 00:37:25,179
Okay, thank you.

535
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,500
Mr. Shi.

536
00:37:36,264 --> 00:37:38,402
Looks like the rock climbing today has brought about some results.

537
00:37:45,553 --> 00:37:46,663
(Not long ago, )

538
00:37:46,744 --> 00:37:49,405
(a journalist also said something along the same lines to me.)

539
00:37:53,743 --> 00:37:55,122
Is there anything?

540
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,242
The journalist from Financial Introduce asked me to tell you

541
00:37:57,323 --> 00:37:59,435
that she has something urgent to talk to you about privately.

542
00:37:59,985 --> 00:38:01,144
Private?

543
00:38:01,224 --> 00:38:02,284
Urgent?

544
00:38:02,426 --> 00:38:04,545
She said she called you but no one answered.

545
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,951
I think she seemed quite anxious.

546
00:38:09,075 --> 00:38:10,387
She didn't say what it was specifically,

547
00:38:10,467 --> 00:38:11,839
so I didn't feel comfortable asking.

548
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,110
Maybe you can call her back?

549
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:17,962
Do you think I should call her back?

550
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,789
Understood. I'll go and reject her.

551
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:22,020
Wait a minute.

552
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,500
Let's go.

553
00:38:29,799 --> 00:38:30,859
Go.

554
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:38,697
(Mr. Shi said)

555
00:38:38,824 --> 00:38:40,985
(during working hours and in a working environment, )

556
00:38:41,088 --> 00:38:42,508
(no private matters shall be discussed.)

557
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,047
During working hours and in a working environment,

558
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,629
no private matters shall be discussed.

559
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,540
What does that mean?

560
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,709
Does it mean he's rejecting me in a fancy way?

561
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,240
The deadline is near.

562
00:39:09,335 --> 00:39:10,966
I can't just sit here and wait.

563
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:12,754
I have to think of something quickly.

564
00:39:13,401 --> 00:39:15,511
Let's see if I can find another way.

565
00:39:23,465 --> 00:39:25,656
(Look at the group of college classmates.)

566
00:39:39,404 --> 00:39:42,274
(Yi. Did you break up with Yue Xing Zhou?)

567
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,620
(Wasn't it him who chased you so hard back then?)

568
00:39:45,792 --> 00:39:47,672
(This girl looks average.)

569
00:39:47,753 --> 00:39:49,093
(Is he blind?)

570
00:39:49,273 --> 00:39:52,183
(I heard this girl's uncle has some background.)

571
00:39:53,296 --> 00:39:55,567
(I knew it. She definitely has some background.)

572
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,990
(Being practical isn't bad either.)

573
00:40:04,049 --> 00:40:05,449
(Shu Yi.)

574
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:07,890
(Look at this group of people and their twisted values.)

575
00:40:07,971 --> 00:40:10,722
(You must win Shi Yan over and shut them up.)

576
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,759
(What should I do to shut them up?)

577
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:16,560
(He said himself that no personal matters should be discussed)

578
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,458
(during working hours and in a working environment.)

579
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,322
(Then, embarrass them.)

580
00:40:27,729 --> 00:40:29,729
(You still wanted to do the special report, right?)

581
00:40:29,824 --> 00:40:31,345
(For both work and private reasons, )

582
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,962
(you have to hurry up and handle him.)

583
00:40:37,633 --> 00:40:38,813
Oh, yeah.

584
00:40:39,464 --> 00:40:42,363
For work reasons, my drafts have always had problems.

585
00:40:42,465 --> 00:40:44,602
I must get clear instructions for revisions

586
00:40:44,683 --> 00:40:46,273
until you are satisfied.

587
00:40:46,928 --> 00:40:50,004
For private reasons, my earring is still with you.

588
00:40:50,085 --> 00:40:51,325
I didn't get it last time.

589
00:40:51,432 --> 00:40:53,442
I'm going to get my stuff. No problem with that, right?

590
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,362
For work and private reasons, I need to see you.

591
00:41:01,719 --> 00:41:02,980
No problem with that.

592
00:41:25,961 --> 00:41:29,282
(I have already told Bruce about your situation and thoughts.)

593
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,322
(He agreed to meet with you.)

594
00:41:31,481 --> 00:41:34,042
(But whether he is willing to stay and help Le'an)

595
00:41:34,184 --> 00:41:35,264
(depends on your performance.)

596
00:41:35,352 --> 00:41:36,453
(Shi Yan.)

597
00:41:36,601 --> 00:41:38,351
(I have to tell you)

598
00:41:38,631 --> 00:41:40,032
(that the possibility is very small.)

599
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,460
Okay, I understand.

600
00:41:41,904 --> 00:41:44,910
I'll prepare well and try to persuade him when we meet.

601
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,282
(Well, I wish you luck.)

602
00:41:55,335 --> 00:41:56,396
Wait a moment.

603
00:41:56,953 --> 00:41:59,752
Tell her that during working hours and in a working environment,

604
00:41:59,833 --> 00:42:01,293
I don't talk about private matters.

605
00:42:24,989 --> 00:42:26,496
Have your meal. I'm going back.

606
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,482
Are you going home to wait for Miss Zheng?
