1
00:01:31,162 --> 00:01:36,063
(Only For Love)

2
00:01:36,144 --> 00:01:39,002
(Episode 19)

3
00:01:39,878 --> 00:01:42,438
You insisted on coming to the ranch with me on the first interview.

4
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,689
You tried so hard to approach me.

5
00:01:45,431 --> 00:01:46,602
Why?

6
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:49,943
(So, he heard what we said.)

7
00:01:53,511 --> 00:01:56,642
At first, I just wanted to interview you.

8
00:01:56,727 --> 00:01:58,316
Yunchuang was so full of potential

9
00:01:58,397 --> 00:01:59,929
and you were so mysterious.

10
00:02:00,014 --> 00:02:02,144
That exclusive interview was crucial for me.

11
00:02:03,311 --> 00:02:04,711
At first?

12
00:02:06,576 --> 00:02:07,991
What about after that?

13
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:10,311
After that...

14
00:02:11,946 --> 00:02:13,937
As I got to know you, I discovered

15
00:02:14,018 --> 00:02:15,897
your charm, talent, and exceptional abilities.

16
00:02:15,978 --> 00:02:18,659
You're the dream lover of thousands of girls in Jiangcheng.

17
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,390
Naturally, I was captivated by you.

18
00:02:21,512 --> 00:02:23,381
So...

19
00:02:23,573 --> 00:02:25,693
I couldn't help but want to be close to you.

20
00:02:30,687 --> 00:02:34,257
Didn't you feel my sincere and passionate heart?

21
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:40,498
(From what you told me yesterday, you were one step away.)

22
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:44,689
(But from what I saw just now, looks like you still have a long way to go.)

23
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,602
(Don't mess it up.)

24
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:56,449
If you don't feel it now, it's okay.

25
00:02:56,729 --> 00:02:58,579
Someday, you'll feel it.

26
00:03:25,133 --> 00:03:26,414
(Zheng Shu Yi, )

27
00:03:26,677 --> 00:03:29,762
(I'll wait for you to completely open your heart to me.)

28
00:03:46,264 --> 00:03:48,595
How's it going, Miss Zheng? Are you getting used to it?

29
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,413
Dou Dou is very gentle,

30
00:03:51,494 --> 00:03:53,887
and Mr. Shi took good care of me. I had a great time.

31
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,242
Mr. Shi's equestrian skills are not inferior to professional athletes.

32
00:04:00,036 --> 00:04:02,379
I experienced Mr. Shi's equestrian skills last time.

33
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,261
He's indeed very good at it.

34
00:04:04,342 --> 00:04:05,785
He's incomparable.

35
00:04:08,784 --> 00:04:09,984
I see.

36
00:04:13,276 --> 00:04:15,637
How was it, Shan Shan? Did you enjoy it?

37
00:04:16,566 --> 00:04:17,606
Not bad.

38
00:04:17,796 --> 00:04:20,498
But after riding for the whole afternoon, I've run out of energy.

39
00:04:20,578 --> 00:04:21,988
I want to go back.

40
00:04:22,905 --> 00:04:24,145
I'm about the same.

41
00:04:24,226 --> 00:04:26,426
Miss Bi, how about I send you back home?

42
00:04:31,027 --> 00:04:33,556
Mr. Shi, please take Shu Yi back home.

43
00:04:35,906 --> 00:04:37,074
Sure.

44
00:05:10,482 --> 00:05:13,102
(Professor Yu, are you free right now?)

45
00:05:13,996 --> 00:05:16,285
(Sorry, I didn't check my phone just now.)

46
00:05:19,036 --> 00:05:20,962
(Do you want to have dinner together?)

47
00:05:22,516 --> 00:05:24,162
(I haven't returned to Jiangcheng yet.)

48
00:05:24,596 --> 00:05:27,576
(All right, I'll wait for your return.)

49
00:05:46,874 --> 00:05:48,274
Thank you, Mr. Guan.

50
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,348
(Approaching someone with a purpose, )

51
00:05:57,429 --> 00:05:58,958
(but ending up falling in love with him.)

52
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:01,179
(Will the other person accept and forgive that?)

53
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:07,549
Isn't that a rhetorical question?

54
00:06:07,731 --> 00:06:09,822
Who would forgive a liar?

55
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,682
(I used work as an excuse)

56
00:06:14,782 --> 00:06:18,082
(to approach an industry elite who kept a low profile.)

57
00:06:18,236 --> 00:06:22,454
(Originally, I thought I could smoothly execute my plan, )

58
00:06:22,551 --> 00:06:24,899
(but as I worked together with him, )

59
00:06:24,981 --> 00:06:28,431
(I was drawn to his professionalism, chivalry, and talent.)

60
00:06:28,512 --> 00:06:30,122
(I genuinely fell for him.)

61
00:06:30,242 --> 00:06:33,394
(I wanted to confess to him that my initial intentions)

62
00:06:33,557 --> 00:06:35,522
(were not purely work-related, )

63
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:39,322
(but I'm afraid to face the outcome where we become strangers.)

64
00:06:39,592 --> 00:06:42,020
(What should I do now?)

65
00:07:32,465 --> 00:07:33,865
How's the wine?

66
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,980
It tastes good, rich, and sweet.

67
00:07:43,482 --> 00:07:44,882
It's aged.

68
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:47,880
Actually, wine becomes more mellow as it ages.

69
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:52,939
What are you trying to say?

70
00:07:57,985 --> 00:07:59,705
Both of us have outgrown the age of

71
00:07:59,963 --> 00:08:02,596
experiencing love at first sight and impulsive, passionate romance.

72
00:08:03,498 --> 00:08:04,858
Being together now

73
00:08:04,976 --> 00:08:09,337
is a choice made after careful consideration and based on our affections.

74
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,482
So...

75
00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:14,727
After going through this adjustment period,

76
00:08:15,624 --> 00:08:17,955
I've been thinking and planning

77
00:08:19,526 --> 00:08:20,926
for our future.

78
00:08:27,018 --> 00:08:28,418
I'm ready now.

79
00:08:30,283 --> 00:08:32,333
Miss Tang, what about you?

80
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,504
What do you think?

81
00:08:51,978 --> 00:08:53,378
Xiang Cheng.

82
00:08:55,688 --> 00:08:58,047
Thank you for taking our relationship seriously.

83
00:08:58,858 --> 00:09:01,228
I'm also willing to be with you.

84
00:09:01,419 --> 00:09:02,602
But

85
00:09:04,831 --> 00:09:08,071
what you said about the future just now,

86
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,810
I think we should think it over carefully.

87
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:12,994
This is my problem.

88
00:09:13,752 --> 00:09:15,152
You should know that

89
00:09:15,338 --> 00:09:18,068
I've never been married, and I have limited dating experience.

90
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:20,869
I can't be sure

91
00:09:21,165 --> 00:09:24,977
if I can handle those problems in the future.

92
00:09:25,073 --> 00:09:28,804
I'm even less sure if I can be a qualified Mrs. Guan.

93
00:09:32,716 --> 00:09:34,414
Are you saying these things

94
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:36,348
for my sake

95
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:37,989
or for yourself?

96
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,250
Judging from those words, it sounds like the problem lies with me.

97
00:09:46,457 --> 00:09:48,442
You, Tang Yi, the esteemed editor,

98
00:09:49,048 --> 00:09:52,178
who handles numerous affairs daily and is good at handling various tasks,

99
00:09:52,367 --> 00:09:55,816
is actually worried about whether you can become a qualified Mrs. Guan.

100
00:09:56,282 --> 00:09:58,411
- I think...   - This doesn't sound like you, Tang Yi.

101
00:10:06,675 --> 00:10:08,075
You have concerns.

102
00:10:09,178 --> 00:10:10,908
You should have confidence in me.

103
00:10:13,818 --> 00:10:16,579
The concerns you had are not problems.

104
00:10:20,556 --> 00:10:22,275
Don't always indulge me.

105
00:10:22,425 --> 00:10:23,876
How did I indulge you?

106
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,470
How did I indulge you?

107
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:33,669
You are just too mature

108
00:10:33,977 --> 00:10:35,377
and considerate.

109
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:36,858
You're overthinking it.

110
00:10:37,023 --> 00:10:39,459
You'll end up compromising yourself and the people around you.

111
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:43,178
When it comes to dating, we should learn more from young people, right?

112
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,819
Like Shi Yan and Shu Yi.

113
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:47,162
They openly love each other and happily spend time together,

114
00:10:47,263 --> 00:10:48,762
with only each other in their eyes.

115
00:10:50,065 --> 00:10:51,715
Why worry so much?

116
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,218
Then I'm indeed not as brave as the two of them.

117
00:10:57,063 --> 00:10:59,153
Maybe I'm getting older.

118
00:11:00,938 --> 00:11:02,468
But in my eyes,

119
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:05,428
you're still a young girl.

120
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:11,408
I mean it, don't worry so much.

121
00:11:14,218 --> 00:11:15,618
Mom, I'm back.

122
00:11:20,236 --> 00:11:21,522
You're back.

123
00:11:21,773 --> 00:11:23,716
Just in time, let's have dinner.

124
00:11:23,841 --> 00:11:24,841
Okay.

125
00:11:25,231 --> 00:11:26,375
Where is Dad?

126
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:30,029
He went to a gathering with his old classmates.

127
00:11:31,499 --> 00:11:33,579
- Don't give me too much rice.   - Okay.

128
00:11:33,676 --> 00:11:34,792
Here.

129
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:40,948
How are you getting along with Mrs. Wang's daughter?

130
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:42,816
Mrs. Wang's daughter?

131
00:11:45,276 --> 00:11:46,805
I'm talking about Shu Yi.

132
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:48,821
Shu Yi?

133
00:11:49,487 --> 00:11:51,737
Mom, why are you suddenly asking about this?

134
00:11:51,867 --> 00:11:54,258
Today, Mrs. Wang called me.

135
00:11:54,392 --> 00:11:55,922
She mentioned you.

136
00:11:56,419 --> 00:11:58,428
She said she has a good impression of you.

137
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:02,419
I also quite like Shu Yi.

138
00:12:02,499 --> 00:12:05,749
Of course, the decision to date and marry is up to you.

139
00:12:06,164 --> 00:12:07,646
But I think,

140
00:12:07,764 --> 00:12:10,899
if two young people have mutual feelings,

141
00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:12,428
they should speed things up.

142
00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:14,489
Think about it,

143
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:15,833
we know her family well,

144
00:12:15,914 --> 00:12:17,572
if you two get married in the future...

145
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:18,712
Mom.

146
00:12:21,493 --> 00:12:24,222
Nothing has happened between me and Shu Yi yet.

147
00:12:26,938 --> 00:12:28,338
You didn't deny it.

148
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:31,519
That means that you're interested in Shu Yi.

149
00:12:32,112 --> 00:12:33,872
Hurry up, put in more effort.

150
00:12:42,516 --> 00:12:43,916
(You didn't deny it.)

151
00:12:44,058 --> 00:12:46,867
(That means that you're interested in Shu Yi.)

152
00:12:47,316 --> 00:12:49,127
(Hurry up, put in more effort.)

153
00:13:19,196 --> 00:13:20,966
(How's your New Year's holiday?)

154
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,939
It's full of ups and downs.

155
00:13:29,796 --> 00:13:31,567
(It's quite eventful.)

156
00:13:32,009 --> 00:13:33,409
(What about you, Professor Yu?)

157
00:13:35,978 --> 00:13:38,989
(Not bad. I'm back in Qing'an to spend time with my parents.)

158
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:46,336
- Hello, Ms. Yi.   - (Hello, Shu Yi.)

159
00:13:46,774 --> 00:13:49,782
I heard you're in a relationship with Shi Yan.

160
00:13:50,938 --> 00:13:52,762
Who told you that?

161
00:13:54,076 --> 00:13:56,286
So, are you two really together?

162
00:13:58,112 --> 00:13:59,512
No.

163
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:01,172
That's weird.

164
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,899
Aren't you two...

165
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,030
(Where did you hear this gossip?)

166
00:14:06,705 --> 00:14:09,396
We're not together. Don't listen to the rumor.

167
00:14:09,828 --> 00:14:11,358
I'm hanging up. Good night.

168
00:14:11,436 --> 00:14:12,552
(Tell me...)

169
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:20,548
I do want to be together with him.

170
00:14:29,483 --> 00:14:32,082
(Sorry, I just got a call.)

171
00:14:35,258 --> 00:14:37,118
(It's okay. It's getting late anyway.)

172
00:14:37,303 --> 00:14:38,995
(Get some rest, good night.)

173
00:14:41,636 --> 00:14:42,802
(Good night.)

174
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:18,882
Uncle.

175
00:15:22,378 --> 00:15:23,778
What's wrong with you?

176
00:15:26,476 --> 00:15:27,876
Going through a breakup?

177
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,322
Are you facing relationship problems?

178
00:15:31,413 --> 00:15:32,984
I can offer you some advice.

179
00:15:33,763 --> 00:15:35,082
Go to sleep.

180
00:15:37,276 --> 00:15:39,995
Who is making my uncle so sad?

181
00:15:40,218 --> 00:15:41,618
Tell me quickly.

182
00:15:43,556 --> 00:15:46,686
I'm a woman. I definitely understand women better than you do.

183
00:15:50,932 --> 00:15:52,942
She doesn't like you?

184
00:15:53,913 --> 00:15:55,313
She's avoiding you?

185
00:15:57,233 --> 00:15:58,633
She lied to you?

186
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:06,011
When a woman lies to you,

187
00:16:06,092 --> 00:16:07,571
it's either because she doesn't love you

188
00:16:07,652 --> 00:16:10,412
or because she loves you too much.

189
00:16:10,893 --> 00:16:12,702
My uncle is so charming.

190
00:16:13,115 --> 00:16:16,234
That person must have lied to you because she loves you too much.

191
00:16:18,764 --> 00:16:21,085
If she doesn't want you to know certain things,

192
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:25,056
it means she thinks those things will ruin her image in your heart.

193
00:16:25,411 --> 00:16:27,031
If she cares about your opinion so much,

194
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,672
doesn't that mean she loves you too much?

195
00:16:32,614 --> 00:16:35,282
People tend to believe what they want to believe.

196
00:16:35,499 --> 00:16:38,579
If he believed in me, he would come and ask me himself.

197
00:16:38,818 --> 00:16:42,749
If he believes in what he hears, explaining won't make a difference.

198
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:45,528
If a person doesn't want to take things further with you,

199
00:16:45,812 --> 00:16:48,242
it's not just because they heard a certain sentence.

200
00:16:48,642 --> 00:16:51,999
Perhaps they simply don't feel that way about you.

201
00:16:59,139 --> 00:17:01,588
Is this what you learned at Financial Introduce?

202
00:17:03,177 --> 00:17:05,107
You have to go to work tomorrow. Go to bed early.

203
00:17:14,956 --> 00:17:16,356
So...

204
00:17:16,565 --> 00:17:18,495
I was right.

205
00:17:21,018 --> 00:17:23,787
Who is causing Uncle so much headache?

206
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,082
Mr. Guan, you seem quite relaxed.

207
00:17:45,257 --> 00:17:46,657
You're back.

208
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:58,394
You went to the racecourse today?

209
00:17:58,476 --> 00:18:00,126
What? Did something happen?

210
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,831
What about you?

211
00:18:09,243 --> 00:18:10,813
Did something happy happen?

212
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:15,998
In a few days, I'll introduce you to someone.

213
00:18:18,329 --> 00:18:20,858
Don't tell me you're taking me to meet my stepmother.

214
00:18:21,283 --> 00:18:24,523
Let me guess, my stepmother is young and beautiful.

215
00:18:24,706 --> 00:18:26,747
And you're significantly older than her.

216
00:18:27,348 --> 00:18:28,748
Who is old?

217
00:18:30,339 --> 00:18:31,739
All right.

218
00:18:32,891 --> 00:18:34,291
I'll meet her another day.

219
00:18:36,379 --> 00:18:38,658
We'll talk about it again when she wants to meet you.

220
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,509
When she wants to meet me?

221
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:44,162
Are you a backup option?

222
00:18:44,521 --> 00:18:46,292
What are you talking about?

223
00:18:48,425 --> 00:18:50,608
She has her concerns.

224
00:18:50,961 --> 00:18:52,230
I respect her.

225
00:18:52,873 --> 00:18:54,273
I'm willing to wait for her.

226
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:56,499
Concerns?

227
00:18:56,994 --> 00:18:58,394
So, her concern is about me?

228
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,980
Do you

229
00:19:01,988 --> 00:19:03,230
like her?

230
00:19:03,626 --> 00:19:05,026
What do you think?

231
00:19:08,216 --> 00:19:12,485
I want to spend the rest of my life with her.

232
00:19:14,017 --> 00:19:15,166
Understood.

233
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,015
Dad.

234
00:19:21,636 --> 00:19:23,847
I hope you can be with the person you love.

235
00:19:25,145 --> 00:19:26,545
I want you to be happy.

236
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:52,839
Hello, Xiang Cheng.

237
00:19:53,218 --> 00:19:55,709
(Yi, I have something to tell you.)

238
00:19:56,401 --> 00:19:57,515
Go on.

239
00:19:58,396 --> 00:20:01,236
(Guan Ji has really grown up.)

240
00:20:02,354 --> 00:20:03,924
You should feel relieved now.

241
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:05,891
(Indeed.)

242
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:07,741
(So, you don't have to worry about him.)

243
00:20:08,977 --> 00:20:11,042
(How about we have dinner together someday)

244
00:20:11,139 --> 00:20:13,219
(and formally introduce you two?)

245
00:20:14,976 --> 00:20:17,376
Sure, let me check my schedule.

246
00:20:19,591 --> 00:20:20,704
Bye.

247
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:42,922
- Quite good.   - All right, they are here.

248
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:45,733
Hello, I'm Cheng Xing.

249
00:20:45,814 --> 00:20:47,642
This is my partner, Hao Wang Shu.

250
00:20:47,778 --> 00:20:49,242
Hello, I'm Shi Yan.

251
00:20:51,235 --> 00:20:52,676
Both of you are really young and promising.

252
00:20:52,757 --> 00:20:54,157
I'm Guan Ji.

253
00:20:54,316 --> 00:20:55,925
I'm Yu You. Nice to meet you.

254
00:21:00,698 --> 00:21:02,322
It seems like both of you manage the company well.

255
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,181
The whole company looks energetic.

256
00:21:04,678 --> 00:21:06,291
It's all thanks to Cheng Xing.

257
00:21:06,372 --> 00:21:09,702
He's in charge of company management and business negotiations.

258
00:21:10,116 --> 00:21:11,522
You're flattering me again.

259
00:21:11,852 --> 00:21:13,634
Wang Shu is responsible for R&D and upgrades.

260
00:21:13,778 --> 00:21:16,162
Technology is the core competitive advantage of our company.

261
00:21:16,267 --> 00:21:19,204
- Let her introduce it to you properly later.   - This way, please.

262
00:21:19,298 --> 00:21:21,938
Let me first take you for a tour of our laboratory.

263
00:21:22,278 --> 00:21:23,446
This way.

264
00:21:33,836 --> 00:21:35,682
Your laboratory is so large.

265
00:21:35,771 --> 00:21:37,322
Why do you still need investment?

266
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:38,682
To be honest, Mr. Guan,

267
00:21:38,763 --> 00:21:41,949
we've invested almost all our earnings into this laboratory.

268
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:43,842
We've made breakthroughs in several technologies,

269
00:21:43,923 --> 00:21:46,894
so we urgently need financial support to do more.

270
00:21:49,879 --> 00:21:50,985
This way, please.

271
00:21:59,042 --> 00:22:02,999
Have a look at this. This is now our company's latest invention.

272
00:22:03,516 --> 00:22:04,909
This way.

273
00:22:10,906 --> 00:22:12,947
We spend most of our time in the laboratory

274
00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:14,522
and occasionally go out for meetings.

275
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,690
We spend very little time in the office.

276
00:22:16,797 --> 00:22:19,602
So, we've reduced the space to save funds.

277
00:22:20,364 --> 00:22:22,364
I've compared your research stage and achievements.

278
00:22:22,485 --> 00:22:24,157
You can be in a leading position in the country.

279
00:22:24,238 --> 00:22:25,864
Many people have high expectations for you.

280
00:22:26,116 --> 00:22:28,126
But according to what you said,

281
00:22:28,521 --> 00:22:30,131
you should be doing well.

282
00:22:30,698 --> 00:22:33,698
Professor Yu, are you wondering why we still don't have money?

283
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:36,904
Wang Shu and I are relatively young.

284
00:22:36,985 --> 00:22:38,040
Our qualifications aren't as extensive.

285
00:22:38,121 --> 00:22:39,642
Our production scale is just moderate.

286
00:22:39,954 --> 00:22:41,521
After investment companies learn about this,

287
00:22:41,602 --> 00:22:43,322
most of them think our ability to generate revenue is average.

288
00:22:43,434 --> 00:22:47,815
Especially because we put 70-80% of our energy and profits into technology.

289
00:22:48,053 --> 00:22:50,472
Therefore, our market share hasn't increased.

290
00:22:55,576 --> 00:22:57,736
I heard that you both graduated from USTC.

291
00:22:58,236 --> 00:22:59,922
Yes, we were classmates.

292
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:02,452
In college, we shared similar goals.

293
00:23:02,836 --> 00:23:06,286
When we graduated, we thought about joining large companies like Zhanlan.

294
00:23:06,424 --> 00:23:07,821
But after looking into it,

295
00:23:07,948 --> 00:23:10,330
we felt starting our own business suited us better.

296
00:23:12,164 --> 00:23:13,965
We already understand your situation.

297
00:23:14,107 --> 00:23:16,602
When we get back, Yunchuang's evaluation team will assess your company.

298
00:23:16,704 --> 00:23:18,922
A project team will follow up with you after this.

299
00:23:19,794 --> 00:23:21,924
Yu You will also provide a detailed report.

300
00:23:27,404 --> 00:23:30,802
Mr. Shi, there's something we hope to discuss now.

301
00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:34,779
We hope to achieve a breakthrough in technology first,

302
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:37,810
establish a leading position in the industry, and then expand production.

303
00:23:38,199 --> 00:23:39,438
No problem.

304
00:23:39,596 --> 00:23:41,877
I think we've reached a consensus on this point.

305
00:23:42,043 --> 00:23:44,578
We prefer companies that prove themselves through their capabilities.

306
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:47,417
Yunchuang values quality over quantity.

307
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:48,842
Only when our technology is leading

308
00:23:48,923 --> 00:23:50,843
can we have a leading position in terms of quantity.

309
00:24:04,553 --> 00:24:07,122
Shu Yi, are you going back to Wucheng for Chinese New Year?

310
00:24:07,516 --> 00:24:09,602
- No.   - Why?

311
00:24:09,947 --> 00:24:11,358
Because I'm not from Wucheng.

312
00:24:14,108 --> 00:24:15,387
I got it wrong.

313
00:24:15,498 --> 00:24:17,098
Isn't Wucheng known for having beautiful women?

314
00:24:17,218 --> 00:24:19,059
I always thought you were from Wucheng.

315
00:24:25,596 --> 00:24:29,566
She said all that just to butter you up.

316
00:24:30,938 --> 00:24:32,388
What's with her recently?

317
00:24:33,396 --> 00:24:34,796
Who knows?

318
00:24:35,716 --> 00:24:38,646
But she reminded me that Chinese New Year is about 10 days.

319
00:24:40,295 --> 00:24:41,602
Right.

320
00:24:42,057 --> 00:24:43,867
I have to buy a ticket home quickly.

321
00:24:43,963 --> 00:24:45,363
I'll check the tickets too.

322
00:24:59,276 --> 00:25:00,442
Mom, what's the matter?

323
00:25:00,523 --> 00:25:01,576
(Yi.)

324
00:25:02,022 --> 00:25:04,267
(Have you and Yu You met recently?)

325
00:25:04,356 --> 00:25:06,005
Mom, I'm at work.

326
00:25:06,356 --> 00:25:07,677
I know.

327
00:25:07,876 --> 00:25:11,486
I just want to ask you, how's your progress with him lately?

328
00:25:11,897 --> 00:25:14,442
Don't force me into a blind date.

329
00:25:15,234 --> 00:25:16,802
How am I forcing you?

330
00:25:16,883 --> 00:25:18,813
What's wrong with Yu You?

331
00:25:18,894 --> 00:25:20,094
(Mom.)

332
00:25:20,348 --> 00:25:23,428
First, I don't have time for blind dates. I'm very busy.

333
00:25:23,509 --> 00:25:25,588
Second, I have a boyfriend.

334
00:25:25,682 --> 00:25:28,042
(If I go meet other men, he would get angry.)

335
00:25:28,828 --> 00:25:29,867
Who is it?

336
00:25:29,948 --> 00:25:31,598
Is it the finance guy?

337
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:34,819
I'm very loyal.

338
00:25:35,652 --> 00:25:36,812
Enough.

339
00:25:36,926 --> 00:25:38,338
You think I don't know you?

340
00:25:38,419 --> 00:25:39,898
(You always say you have a boyfriend, )

341
00:25:39,978 --> 00:25:43,148
(but I've never seen you post anything on social media or bring him home.)

342
00:25:43,756 --> 00:25:46,282
Could it be that he's so ugly you can't show him to people?

343
00:25:46,594 --> 00:25:49,802
(That's impossible. You have the same taste as me, I know that.)

344
00:25:49,924 --> 00:25:52,693
I really have a boyfriend. Why won't you believe me?

345
00:25:54,411 --> 00:25:56,682
Then bring him home for Chinese New Year.

346
00:25:57,194 --> 00:25:58,515
He's busy.

347
00:25:58,596 --> 00:25:59,636
(Is that so?)

348
00:25:59,699 --> 00:26:01,122
(How old is he?)

349
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:02,330
Twenty-seven years old.

350
00:26:02,411 --> 00:26:03,811
What does his family do?

351
00:26:03,915 --> 00:26:05,315
(They run a business.)

352
00:26:07,018 --> 00:26:09,898
Send me his photo. Let me take a look.

353
00:26:10,636 --> 00:26:12,242
(You don't even have his photos?)

354
00:26:12,514 --> 00:26:14,261
(I knew you were lying.)

355
00:26:14,342 --> 00:26:16,204
I'll send it to you later. I'm busy.

356
00:26:16,316 --> 00:26:18,518
- (I'll hang up now.)   - You...

357
00:26:32,937 --> 00:26:34,202
(Where are the photos?)

358
00:26:34,323 --> 00:26:36,173
(Come on, show me.)

359
00:26:36,857 --> 00:26:39,827
(I want to see if he's as handsome as Yu You.)

360
00:26:58,517 --> 00:27:00,602
Even if I'm not after anything else,

361
00:27:00,965 --> 00:27:02,962
just based on his appearance,

362
00:27:03,379 --> 00:27:05,429
having him as a boyfriend doesn't seem like a loss.

363
00:27:18,672 --> 00:27:21,401
(Look, this is your future son-in-law.)

364
00:27:28,461 --> 00:27:30,042
(This is your stepfather.)

365
00:27:30,285 --> 00:27:33,685
(I'm teaching at a university after all, and I often use the Internet.)

366
00:27:33,811 --> 00:27:37,580
(You shouldn't underestimate me by using this method to deceive me.)

367
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,260
(This weekend, make a date with Yu You quickly.)

368
00:27:40,379 --> 00:27:42,859
(Otherwise, you know what will happen.)

369
00:28:07,116 --> 00:28:09,357
(Professor Yu, are you free on the weekend?)

370
00:28:09,468 --> 00:28:11,838
(If you're free, I'd like to invite you for a meal.)

371
00:28:21,095 --> 00:28:23,595
Shu Yi. What's wrong?

372
00:28:23,676 --> 00:28:25,596
Is there any problem at work?

373
00:28:27,611 --> 00:28:29,251
Work is not a problem for me.

374
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:30,932
The only trouble I have is my mom.

375
00:28:31,013 --> 00:28:32,463
She's pushing me into blind dates again.

376
00:28:33,201 --> 00:28:34,601
You're going on a blind date?

377
00:28:35,817 --> 00:28:39,257
Is it the blind date who has good qualities and isn't inferior to Uncle?

378
00:28:42,426 --> 00:28:44,562
But didn't you...

379
00:28:44,694 --> 00:28:47,773
My mom is forcing me into it. I asked him out on Sunday.

380
00:28:47,891 --> 00:28:49,252
Do you think I want to go?

381
00:28:49,419 --> 00:28:51,118
Then just don't go.

382
00:28:51,203 --> 00:28:53,813
Didn't we agree that I would treat you to a spa on Sunday?

383
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:57,966
You don't understand my troubles.

384
00:28:59,914 --> 00:29:02,442
Your mom is anxious for you to get married.

385
00:29:02,851 --> 00:29:04,981
She's completely addicted to matchmaking.

386
00:29:05,982 --> 00:29:08,268
She unilaterally thinks he has good conditions

387
00:29:08,349 --> 00:29:10,322
and that we're a perfect match.

388
00:29:10,713 --> 00:29:12,113
What does he do?

389
00:29:12,496 --> 00:29:13,896
He's a university professor.

390
00:29:14,673 --> 00:29:17,444
Why are there so many university professors these days?

391
00:29:19,476 --> 00:29:20,682
Nothing.

392
00:29:20,805 --> 00:29:22,962
I mean, what does he teach?

393
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,349
He teaches finance.

394
00:29:24,436 --> 00:29:25,836
Finance?

395
00:29:27,147 --> 00:29:29,796
That matches well with you.

396
00:29:29,996 --> 00:29:32,485
You'll have a lot of common topics to talk about.

397
00:29:33,756 --> 00:29:35,846
But in this case,

398
00:29:36,082 --> 00:29:37,971
what about your "Uncle"?

399
00:29:39,967 --> 00:29:43,896
(If I tell Shi Yan I'm being forced into a blind date...)

400
00:29:46,819 --> 00:29:49,722
Shi Yan, my mom forced me to go on a blind date.

401
00:29:49,859 --> 00:29:51,259
We...

402
00:29:51,433 --> 00:29:52,849
Shu Yi,

403
00:29:53,063 --> 00:29:54,463
don't go.

404
00:29:56,331 --> 00:29:57,448
(No.)

405
00:29:57,618 --> 00:29:59,508
(Shi Yan isn't like that.)

406
00:30:03,156 --> 00:30:05,242
I can't disobey my mom.

407
00:30:05,323 --> 00:30:08,347
I can only go on this blind date. We...

408
00:30:08,428 --> 00:30:09,860
I don't agree with this.

409
00:30:10,138 --> 00:30:12,482
I'll go talk to your mom and clarify everything.

410
00:30:12,603 --> 00:30:14,293
I'll stop this from happening.

411
00:30:14,585 --> 00:30:15,985
It won't work.

412
00:30:17,619 --> 00:30:18,898
No matter what,

413
00:30:18,978 --> 00:30:22,206
I won't allow my woman to go on blind dates.

414
00:30:23,716 --> 00:30:25,442
(That's impossible.)

415
00:30:25,756 --> 00:30:28,722
(Given Shi Yan's personality, even if I tell him, )

416
00:30:28,854 --> 00:30:30,627
(he'll only...)

417
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:35,962
Shi Yan, my mom forced me to go on a blind date.

418
00:30:40,722 --> 00:30:42,522
Miss Zheng, please do your best then.

419
00:30:49,428 --> 00:30:50,762
Shu Yi?

420
00:30:56,691 --> 00:30:57,852
Yue.

421
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,579
Didn't you invite me to go for a spa treatment on Sunday?

422
00:31:00,675 --> 00:31:03,525
Are you interested in having dinner together too?

423
00:31:07,738 --> 00:31:11,271
Shu Yi, you're bringing me to your blind date.

424
00:31:12,916 --> 00:31:14,402
Isn't this inappropriate?

425
00:31:14,483 --> 00:31:16,576
Appropriate. This is so appropriate.

426
00:31:16,657 --> 00:31:18,778
If I come alone, it'll be inappropriate.

427
00:31:20,138 --> 00:31:22,242
I understand.

428
00:31:22,638 --> 00:31:24,522
You still want to be with Uncle.

429
00:31:26,196 --> 00:31:27,722
- It's here.   - Okay.

430
00:31:38,076 --> 00:31:39,316
Shu Yi.

431
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,002
Your blind date

432
00:31:41,402 --> 00:31:42,811
is Professor Yu?

433
00:31:44,406 --> 00:31:45,606
Yes.

434
00:31:48,895 --> 00:31:50,038
Shu Yi.

435
00:31:51,347 --> 00:31:52,666
Sorry, I'm late.

436
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:54,682
No, I arrived too early.

437
00:31:57,139 --> 00:31:59,522
This is my intern, Qin Shi Yue.

438
00:31:59,603 --> 00:32:02,532
Her family didn't prepare her dinner today, so I brought her along.

439
00:32:02,635 --> 00:32:04,253
Yue, this is Professor Yu.

440
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:08,299
Professor Yu, hello.

441
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:13,765
Hello, have a seat.

442
00:32:19,667 --> 00:32:22,507
Shu Yi, I actually wanted to have dinner with you some time ago.

443
00:32:23,796 --> 00:32:26,357
I read your article about Zhanlan. It was well written.

444
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,522
My friends and I benefited a lot from it.

445
00:32:28,725 --> 00:32:29,885
You're flattering me.

446
00:32:29,996 --> 00:32:31,756
Your insights are unique and sharp as always.

447
00:32:31,837 --> 00:32:33,356
I can tell you've done a lot of research.

448
00:32:33,474 --> 00:32:34,884
I feel inferior to you.

449
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:37,442
Indeed, I've done a lot of research.

450
00:32:37,523 --> 00:32:39,162
I even went to Zhanlan personally.

451
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,933
(When he texted me on WeChat, he sent messages word by word, )

452
00:32:44,077 --> 00:32:45,922
(as if he wished he could send the very air itself.)

453
00:32:45,996 --> 00:32:49,366
(But now, he has endless things to talk about with Shu Yi.)

454
00:32:50,252 --> 00:32:51,771
Professor Yu,

455
00:32:51,938 --> 00:32:54,828
actually, I'm here today because my mom insisted.

456
00:32:54,993 --> 00:32:57,552
Actually, my mother also urged me to meet you for dinner.

457
00:32:58,498 --> 00:33:01,219
I'm only 25 years old. I'm not ready for this.

458
00:33:02,171 --> 00:33:03,452
You're still young.

459
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:06,169
But I am already 30 years old, so my mom is a bit anxious.

460
00:33:09,593 --> 00:33:11,112
But I'm not in a hurry.

461
00:33:11,193 --> 00:33:13,234
I don't have the energy to date.

462
00:33:13,315 --> 00:33:16,834
Nor do I have the intention to invest in a relationship or even marriage.

463
00:33:17,041 --> 00:33:18,441
I see.

464
00:33:22,085 --> 00:33:23,125
(Battery Revolution)

465
00:33:23,206 --> 00:33:26,042
(Challenges and Future of Battery Companies Represented by Zhanlan)

466
00:33:33,055 --> 00:33:34,242
Shi Yan.

467
00:33:36,379 --> 00:33:38,229
Dad, what's the matter?

468
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:40,209
The meal is ready.

469
00:33:41,992 --> 00:33:43,202
Shi Yan.

470
00:33:43,916 --> 00:33:47,525
I heard that you're still dating that actress.

471
00:33:49,073 --> 00:33:50,682
Who told you that?

472
00:33:51,099 --> 00:33:52,989
What's happening?

473
00:33:53,584 --> 00:33:55,118
She's just a journalist.

474
00:33:55,196 --> 00:33:56,803
It's just that she has a strong desire to perform.

475
00:33:56,884 --> 00:33:59,722
To say she's an actress is an insult to the profession.

476
00:34:01,487 --> 00:34:02,689
Okay.

477
00:34:03,922 --> 00:34:05,453
Why hasn't Yue come back yet?

478
00:34:11,651 --> 00:34:13,651
Sorry, I need to take a call.

479
00:34:19,258 --> 00:34:20,482
Hello, Grandpa.

480
00:34:20,563 --> 00:34:21,642
(Yue.)

481
00:34:21,777 --> 00:34:23,868
Did you go out to dinner with your leader?

482
00:34:24,716 --> 00:34:26,367
I'm accompanying her on a blind date.

483
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:30,268
Yue,

484
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:33,949
your leader is two or three years older than you,

485
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:36,402
and she's already starting to go on blind dates.

486
00:34:36,534 --> 00:34:37,934
What about you?

487
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:41,762
(They are both intellectuals with a wealth of knowledge.)

488
00:34:41,942 --> 00:34:44,388
(One writes academic papers, the other conducts interviews.)

489
00:34:44,523 --> 00:34:46,109
(It's a perfect match.)

490
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:49,730
Even if I say right now that I want to get married,

491
00:34:49,841 --> 00:34:51,892
he won't want me either.

492
00:34:52,194 --> 00:34:53,451
For people like me,

493
00:34:53,532 --> 00:34:56,541
except for Grandpa, no one loves me.

494
00:34:58,077 --> 00:34:59,125
Qin Shi Yue,

495
00:34:59,206 --> 00:35:00,962
(stop gossiping about others.)

496
00:35:08,716 --> 00:35:10,116
Where's Shu Yi?

497
00:35:10,825 --> 00:35:12,225
She went to the washroom.

498
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:19,642
Professor Yu.

499
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:25,766
Do you like Shu Yi?

500
00:35:32,436 --> 00:35:35,965
As a matter of fact, I admire girls like Shu Yi.

501
00:35:37,346 --> 00:35:38,642
Sure enough.

502
00:35:39,066 --> 00:35:41,876
But relationships are a matter between two people.

503
00:35:42,259 --> 00:35:44,642
Shu Yi doesn't have romantic feelings for me right now.

504
00:35:44,756 --> 00:35:47,646
I will try to be friends with her.

505
00:35:51,436 --> 00:35:52,836
So,

506
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:56,381
does that mean I don't have a chance?

507
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:03,712
I'm sorry.

508
00:36:11,236 --> 00:36:13,545
(How did it go? Are you enjoying the meal?)

509
00:36:13,644 --> 00:36:16,882
(Continue next week, but you can't just eat.)

510
00:36:17,067 --> 00:36:19,373
(I found some good activities for you.)

511
00:36:19,472 --> 00:36:22,318
(Go visit an art exhibition to refine your sentiments.)

512
00:36:25,042 --> 00:36:26,642
What's wrong, Shu Yi?

513
00:36:26,996 --> 00:36:28,396
Nothing.

514
00:36:29,682 --> 00:36:32,403
My mom insists that you go to an exhibition with me next week.

515
00:36:33,796 --> 00:36:34,956
Don't worry.

516
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:36,627
I'll find a way to reject her.

517
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:41,090
I think

518
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:43,829
you should go to the exhibition.

519
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:47,979
Shu Yi, think about it.

520
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,178
Moms are like that.

521
00:36:49,259 --> 00:36:51,042
If she asks you to go but you say no,

522
00:36:51,108 --> 00:36:53,242
she'll have 100 reasons to persuade you.

523
00:36:53,446 --> 00:36:55,565
So if she asked you to go, just go.

524
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:57,714
If you go, she won't bother you anymore.

525
00:36:57,826 --> 00:37:00,797
It will save a lot of trouble in the long run.

526
00:37:04,796 --> 00:37:07,407
But Professor Yu, do you have time for that?

527
00:37:08,516 --> 00:37:09,609
I do.

528
00:37:11,516 --> 00:37:13,876
It doesn't seem appropriate for the two of us to go together.

529
00:37:16,356 --> 00:37:19,010
Then the three of us should go together.

530
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:21,138
Good idea.

531
00:37:21,362 --> 00:37:22,762
Then it's settled.

532
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:25,255
Okay.

533
00:37:37,893 --> 00:37:39,995
Thank you for giving me a ride home, Professor Yu.

534
00:37:40,107 --> 00:37:41,556
I have a car. It's the least I can do.

535
00:37:43,192 --> 00:37:44,399
Shu Yi.

536
00:37:45,298 --> 00:37:47,642
I have a question, it might be a bit abrupt.

537
00:37:47,738 --> 00:37:49,188
I hope you don't mind.

538
00:37:49,514 --> 00:37:50,715
Ask away.

539
00:37:50,937 --> 00:37:53,418
Have you been single for a long time?

540
00:37:56,059 --> 00:37:58,042
It's been quite some time.

541
00:37:58,642 --> 00:38:00,402
(Yue Xing Zhou is a scumbag.)

542
00:38:00,483 --> 00:38:01,883
(He doesn't count.)

543
00:38:02,926 --> 00:38:04,775
But you must have a lot of suitors.

544
00:38:05,876 --> 00:38:08,366
Are you in love with someone who is impossible to be with?

545
00:38:11,562 --> 00:38:12,962
Sort of.

546
00:38:16,234 --> 00:38:19,354
Since our families are urging us, why don't we just deal with them first?

547
00:38:20,036 --> 00:38:21,676
Just say that we've been in touch,

548
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:23,758
but we still need to know each other better.

549
00:38:23,869 --> 00:38:25,490
This way, we can make them stop urging us

550
00:38:25,579 --> 00:38:27,949
and also prevent them from arranging more blind dates for us.

551
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,430
What do you think?

552
00:38:29,893 --> 00:38:31,642
I think that's a good idea.

553
00:38:31,845 --> 00:38:34,564
It's good for you, for me and our moms.

554
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,006
What a good idea.

555
00:38:36,162 --> 00:38:37,562
Let's go with that.

556
00:38:37,683 --> 00:38:38,778
Okay.

557
00:38:42,418 --> 00:38:44,019
Be safe on the road, bye.

558
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:45,242
Bye.

559
00:38:57,656 --> 00:38:58,962
Zheng Shu Yi.

560
00:39:07,429 --> 00:39:11,549
(Oh no, he probably saw everything.)

561
00:39:25,051 --> 00:39:26,482
What are you doing here?

562
00:39:28,884 --> 00:39:30,284
What do you think?

563
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,098
That guy is my mom's colleague's son.

564
00:39:33,179 --> 00:39:35,820
We're high school alumni, we got together for a meal as friends.

565
00:39:35,901 --> 00:39:37,301
My colleague was also there.

566
00:39:41,019 --> 00:39:43,399
Catching up with an old friend, is it?

567
00:39:44,228 --> 00:39:45,482
Yes.

568
00:39:46,405 --> 00:39:48,054
I thought you were on a blind date.

569
00:39:49,007 --> 00:39:50,287
(I knew it.)

570
00:39:50,459 --> 00:39:51,922
(What's the matter with him?)

571
00:39:52,037 --> 00:39:54,162
(How could he see through that?)

572
00:39:54,443 --> 00:39:57,338
What blind date? How could I possibly go on a blind date?

573
00:39:57,418 --> 00:39:58,829
You're joking.

574
00:39:58,957 --> 00:40:02,682
It's the weekend, so I was catching up with an old friend.

575
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:07,099
Catching up? You seem to have a lot of free time.

576
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,562
(Why would I get angry with him?)

577
00:40:12,788 --> 00:40:15,628
(Shi Yan never talks sensibly anyway.)

578
00:40:15,853 --> 00:40:18,442
(He's just upset and jealous.)

579
00:40:34,339 --> 00:40:37,109
I'm quite free. I don't have anyone to accompany me.

580
00:40:37,785 --> 00:40:39,185
Zheng Shu Yi.

581
00:40:42,518 --> 00:40:43,918
I can't wait any longer.

582
00:40:52,531 --> 00:40:55,791
No matter what your intentions are in approaching me, I accept it all.

583
00:40:57,074 --> 00:40:58,474
I can't wait any longer.

584
00:41:12,358 --> 00:41:13,562
Shi Yan,

585
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,320
are you jealous?

586
00:41:33,383 --> 00:41:34,783
Answer it.

587
00:41:43,178 --> 00:41:45,362
(Hello, Miss Zheng Shu Yi, good evening.)

588
00:41:45,443 --> 00:41:47,562
(This is Mankalina Beauty Center.)

589
00:41:47,643 --> 00:41:50,282
(We're currently having an anniversary promotion.)

590
00:41:50,567 --> 00:41:51,817
(As a gesture of appreciation for our loyal customers, )

591
00:41:51,898 --> 00:41:54,882
(we introduced Red Beauty Water for our members to try for free.)

592
00:41:54,963 --> 00:41:58,242
(I was wondering if you have time next weekend to come and try it out.)

593
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,682
Next weekend?

594
00:42:04,988 --> 00:42:06,758
I don't have any plans next weekend.

595
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:08,239
I should be free.

596
00:42:08,551 --> 00:42:11,802
(Great, let me schedule an appointment for you in advance.)

597
00:42:16,204 --> 00:42:18,642
How is the in-depth special coverage for Yunchuang coming along?

598
00:42:19,718 --> 00:42:20,902
Since you're so free,

599
00:42:21,003 --> 00:42:23,602
come to Yunchuang to work overtime next weekend.

600
00:42:25,634 --> 00:42:28,795
(No, I was hinting that you go on a date with me.)

601
00:42:28,917 --> 00:42:30,522
But you asked me to work overtime?
