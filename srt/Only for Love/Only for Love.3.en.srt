00:01:31,202 --> 00:01:36,166
(Only For Love)

2
00:01:36,247 --> 00:01:39,068
(Episode 3)

3
00:01:47,613 --> 00:01:50,286
(Mr. Shi, the reporter from Financial Introduce has arrived.)

4
00:01:51,997 --> 00:01:53,277
Isn't the appointment at 1pm?

5
00:01:53,357 --> 00:01:55,316
(She arrived early. I'll ask her to wait.)

6
00:01:55,397 --> 00:01:57,371
No need, bring her in.

7
00:02:25,133 --> 00:02:26,392
Hello, Mr. Shi.

8
00:02:35,275 --> 00:02:36,615
Who are you?

9
00:02:36,975 --> 00:02:39,129
I'm a journalist from Financial Introduce, Xu Yu Ling.

10
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,762
My colleague can't make it today,

11
00:02:40,843 --> 00:02:42,956
so she entrusted me to conduct this interview.

12
00:02:46,437 --> 00:02:47,577
Thank you.

13
00:02:53,637 --> 00:02:55,156
Let's get started then, Mr. Shi.

14
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:56,519
Wait a minute, Miss Xu.

15
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,656
Can I have a look at your outline?

16
00:02:59,917 --> 00:03:01,097
Sure.

17
00:03:14,922 --> 00:03:17,140
(Interview outline for Shi Yan)

18
00:03:22,477 --> 00:03:23,870
Let's begin.

19
00:03:32,872 --> 00:03:36,053
Mingyu Yunchuang is a subsidiary of Mingyu Group.

20
00:03:36,134 --> 00:03:38,356
The most authoritative evaluation company in the industry

21
00:03:38,437 --> 00:03:40,224
has given it an AA rating.

22
00:03:40,305 --> 00:03:41,521
Due to its promising outlook,

23
00:03:41,602 --> 00:03:44,162
they even upgraded its parent company's credit rating.

24
00:03:44,268 --> 00:03:46,389
The future of Yunchuang is undoubtedly very promising.

25
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,259
The main theme of this interview is focused on Mingyu Yunchuang's

26
00:03:49,339 --> 00:03:51,922
development plan and necessary preparations for the next five years,

27
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:54,955
as well as the role it plays under its parent company,

28
00:03:55,036 --> 00:03:56,180
among other related questions.

29
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,117
First of all, I would like to ask you to talk about

30
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,093
your vision when establishing Mingyu Yunchuang.

31
00:04:03,179 --> 00:04:04,519
Register this.

32
00:04:06,327 --> 00:04:07,347
Hello.

33
00:04:07,779 --> 00:04:09,810
Hello, I'm a journalist from Financial Introduce.

34
00:04:09,891 --> 00:04:11,107
Please register first.

35
00:04:17,037 --> 00:04:19,850
Are all journalists from your magazine as pretty as you?

36
00:04:27,507 --> 00:04:29,298
(Xu Yu Ling?)

37
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:33,210
(Why is Xu Yu Ling's name on the registration list?)

38
00:04:36,957 --> 00:04:38,218
Thank you.

39
00:04:47,197 --> 00:04:48,345
Mr. Chen!

40
00:04:49,557 --> 00:04:50,707
Miss Zheng?

41
00:04:51,828 --> 00:04:54,056
The interview with Mr. Shi that we scheduled for 1pm today

42
00:04:54,137 --> 00:04:55,362
will proceed as planned, right?

43
00:04:55,619 --> 00:04:57,056
Aren't you engaged in other matters?

44
00:04:57,142 --> 00:04:59,322
Your colleague already conducted the interview on your behalf.

45
00:04:59,512 --> 00:05:02,522
She came during lunchtime, and Mr. Shi happened to be free then.

46
00:05:02,727 --> 00:05:05,777
She also mentioned that you entrusted her to conduct the interview.

47
00:05:08,357 --> 00:05:11,101
I'm sorry, there was a lack of communication within our team.

48
00:05:12,376 --> 00:05:13,722
Sorry that you have to come all the way here.

49
00:05:13,845 --> 00:05:15,105
No worries.

50
00:05:15,717 --> 00:05:16,976
But...

51
00:06:05,517 --> 00:06:08,276
Mr. Shi, we had an appointment for an interview this afternoon.

52
00:06:08,357 --> 00:06:10,220
Mr. Shi has to go out now. Miss Zheng, please leave.

53
00:06:10,301 --> 00:06:11,922
The interview has concluded today.

54
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,017
I've been looking forward to this interview,

55
00:06:14,132 --> 00:06:15,722
and I finally got the chance today.

56
00:06:15,938 --> 00:06:18,008
Are you available now?

57
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:24,522
Mr. Shi, you've completed the basic part of the interview,

58
00:06:24,775 --> 00:06:26,817
but there are still five questions about Yunchuang's future

59
00:06:26,898 --> 00:06:28,482
that you haven't answered yet.

60
00:06:36,877 --> 00:06:39,237
I'll just take up a little of your time.

61
00:06:39,426 --> 00:06:40,607
Can I?

62
00:06:41,477 --> 00:06:43,228
What are those five questions?

63
00:06:46,894 --> 00:06:50,036
Question one, as a subsidiary of Mingyu Group,

64
00:06:50,117 --> 00:06:52,556
does Yunchuang have plans to operate independently from its parent company

65
00:06:52,637 --> 00:06:54,667
and expand into larger markets?

66
00:06:55,798 --> 00:06:59,158
Question two, regarding Yunchuang's collaboration with Guan Capital,

67
00:06:59,269 --> 00:07:02,308
besides exploring investments in more adventurous areas,

68
00:07:02,396 --> 00:07:04,522
are there any long-term plans?

69
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:08,537
Question three, is Professor Yu You's return to China a part of your plans?

70
00:07:22,456 --> 00:07:24,673
This is your first personal interview,

71
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:28,190
marking the first step in the external understanding of Yunchuang.

72
00:07:28,717 --> 00:07:30,269
So...

73
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,522
I believe

74
00:07:33,603 --> 00:07:35,087
you'll provide the media and the public

75
00:07:35,168 --> 00:07:38,522
with an opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of Yunchuang, right?

76
00:07:40,146 --> 00:07:41,235
Come with me.

77
00:07:54,117 --> 00:07:55,297
Mr. Shi.

78
00:07:55,446 --> 00:07:57,922
May I know where we are...

79
00:08:13,557 --> 00:08:15,642
(Tell my uncle to answer the phone!)

80
00:08:19,557 --> 00:08:21,642
(Oh my God, the mistress?)

81
00:08:22,917 --> 00:08:25,627
Tell her that if she doesn't behave, don't show up in front of me again.

82
00:08:27,811 --> 00:08:31,520
Miss Qin, you heard what Mr. Shi said.

83
00:08:33,989 --> 00:08:35,562
(He's quite authoritative.)

84
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:36,885
(If you're so authoritative, )

85
00:08:36,966 --> 00:08:39,922
(why don't you teach your niece not to be a mistress?)

86
00:08:56,468 --> 00:08:57,488
Mr. Shi,

87
00:08:57,748 --> 00:08:59,899
Mr. Fan is waiting for you in the business car.

88
00:09:00,611 --> 00:09:01,912
Tell him to come over.

89
00:09:02,412 --> 00:09:04,751
Miss Zheng probably prefers to sit in this car.

90
00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:06,438
Me?

91
00:09:13,045 --> 00:09:15,642
I have a two-hour journey. We can talk in the car.

92
00:09:19,861 --> 00:09:23,091
Didn't you say we could utilize the time in the car earlier?

93
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,525
Of course, no problem.

94
00:09:26,676 --> 00:09:28,740
(We can even talk under the car if you want.)

95
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:31,511
Mr. Shi.

96
00:09:39,633 --> 00:09:42,965
(I can't believe I would have to interview Shi Yan in this way.)

97
00:10:07,476 --> 00:10:08,801
(Trust me.)

98
00:10:08,893 --> 00:10:12,014
(Even if Shi Yan is outstanding, he is still a man.)

99
00:10:12,142 --> 00:10:14,082
(Men are not immune to this approach.)

100
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,525
(Shan Shan's tricks didn't work.)

101
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:56,632
Are you cold?

102
00:11:00,634 --> 00:11:01,642
No.

103
00:11:02,313 --> 00:11:04,522
Fan, roll down the window.

104
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:06,381
Okay, Mr. Shi.

105
00:11:18,133 --> 00:11:21,202
(I said I'm not cold, but it doesn't mean I'm hot.)

106
00:11:22,637 --> 00:11:24,242
I have limited time.

107
00:11:33,101 --> 00:11:35,780
Mr. Shi, before we officially start,

108
00:11:35,884 --> 00:11:38,835
let's talk about something else first for better communication.

109
00:11:40,983 --> 00:11:42,282
What do you want to talk about?

110
00:11:42,597 --> 00:11:45,037
I'm sure you rarely accepted interview invitations.

111
00:11:45,117 --> 00:11:49,217
Usually, before we start, we'll get to know the interviewee a little.

112
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:52,298
Let's introduce ourselves then.

113
00:11:53,557 --> 00:11:55,887
Didn't you say we should get to know each other a bit?

114
00:11:57,869 --> 00:12:00,150
I'm Zheng Shu Yi, a journalist from Financial Introduce.

115
00:12:00,237 --> 00:12:02,907
I'm very honored to interview you today.

116
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:06,028
Shi Yan, 27 years old, CEO of Mingyu Yunchuang.

117
00:12:06,131 --> 00:12:08,842
(Why did I come up with this stupid method?)

118
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,211
Mr. Shi, you're indeed young and promising.

119
00:12:15,557 --> 00:12:17,348
(She's saying the same thing.)

120
00:12:18,309 --> 00:12:20,989
Actually, I waited for you at Warner Estate last time,

121
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:22,858
it was just a stroke of luck.

122
00:12:23,421 --> 00:12:26,330
I heard that Mr. Guan from Guan Capital would also be there.

123
00:12:26,542 --> 00:12:27,861
Since you have close ties with him,

124
00:12:27,972 --> 00:12:29,482
perhaps you'd go and show your support.

125
00:12:29,562 --> 00:12:31,856
Although you rarely attend such events,

126
00:12:31,937 --> 00:12:33,846
my luck might have favored me.

127
00:12:34,292 --> 00:12:37,372
After all, the publication date is the deadline for us journalists.

128
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,465
Turns out I did get lucky.

129
00:12:39,546 --> 00:12:42,199
I didn't get to interview you, but I was lucky enough to meet you.

130
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,512
So, is your collaboration with Guan Capital

131
00:12:44,593 --> 00:12:46,039
going to be officially announced soon?

132
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,626
Are you both going to venture into mutually interesting fields?

133
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,926
Mr. Shi, did I say something wrong?

134
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:12,381
Why do you think Guan Capital wants to collaborate with Yunchuang?

135
00:13:12,462 --> 00:13:15,131
What do you think Yunchuang and Guan Capital would do?

136
00:13:49,758 --> 00:13:51,202
Is that all your questions?

137
00:14:00,637 --> 00:14:03,112
Mr. Shi, I have one more question.

138
00:14:03,572 --> 00:14:06,008
Why didn't you stay at Mingyu Group back then?

139
00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:07,808
Why did you choose to start your own business?

140
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:10,320
Did your father support your decision?

141
00:14:16,686 --> 00:14:18,522
I'm getting old.

142
00:14:19,877 --> 00:14:23,122
There are a lot of things I can't handle anymore.

143
00:14:23,402 --> 00:14:27,752
Mingyu was able to survive this time thanks to some old friends.

144
00:14:29,012 --> 00:14:30,472
The future of Mingyu

145
00:14:31,397 --> 00:14:32,736
depends on you.

146
00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:36,929
Actually, my brother-in-law is more suitable than me.

147
00:14:37,837 --> 00:14:39,337
But your surname is Shi,

148
00:14:39,717 --> 00:14:41,827
Mingyu needs you.

149
00:14:42,388 --> 00:14:44,328
My brother-in-law is also a part of the Shi family.

150
00:14:44,409 --> 00:14:47,789
I still want to do something meaningful and fulfilling by myself.

151
00:14:47,997 --> 00:14:49,017
Why do you...

152
00:14:51,195 --> 00:14:52,986
Have you thought it through?

153
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:54,573
I thought it through.

154
00:14:54,831 --> 00:14:56,091
This path

155
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,949
might be challenging.

156
00:14:59,059 --> 00:15:00,359
I know,

157
00:15:00,905 --> 00:15:02,226
but someone has to walk it.

158
00:15:02,317 --> 00:15:03,317
You...

159
00:15:18,221 --> 00:15:19,849
I'm retiring soon.

160
00:15:20,357 --> 00:15:22,347
I probably won't need to use

161
00:15:22,917 --> 00:15:24,717
the car at home anymore.

162
00:15:25,757 --> 00:15:27,137
Take the car.

163
00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:30,228
Thank you, Dad.

164
00:15:35,859 --> 00:15:37,066
Two hours are up.

165
00:16:07,997 --> 00:16:09,418
You can leave now.

166
00:16:13,304 --> 00:16:15,802
(How am I supposed to leave this remote place?)

167
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,530
(By riding a horse?)

168
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,362
(You really hold grudges, Shi Yan.)

169
00:16:21,518 --> 00:16:25,078
(You want me to surrender in this remote place?)

170
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,680
(Absolutely impossible.)

171
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:32,274
(I came here in this car, and I have to go back in it too.)

172
00:16:34,597 --> 00:16:37,502
Mr. Shi, you have a very nice voice.

173
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:38,885
Can I crop some of your statements

174
00:16:38,966 --> 00:16:41,362
and use them as audio in our digital magazine?

175
00:16:44,633 --> 00:16:46,854
I want to ensure the integrity of my viewpoints.

176
00:16:48,037 --> 00:16:49,302
That's a yes.

177
00:16:51,317 --> 00:16:52,396
Wait a minute, Mr. Shi.

178
00:16:52,492 --> 00:16:54,003
I have one last question.

179
00:16:55,213 --> 00:16:56,233
Say it.

180
00:16:57,077 --> 00:16:59,186
Do you have a girlfriend?

181
00:17:13,797 --> 00:17:17,157
This question is to satisfy the curiosity of our readers.

182
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:19,876
Mr. Shi, it's okay if you don't want to answer.

183
00:17:22,471 --> 00:17:23,897
Actually, my final question is about

184
00:17:23,978 --> 00:17:25,922
why a young investment company like Mingyu Yunchuang

185
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,362
decides to invest in Le'an Technology.

186
00:17:27,477 --> 00:17:29,637
Aren't you worried about the long research and development cycle

187
00:17:29,718 --> 00:17:31,198
and the absence of immediate returns?

188
00:17:33,743 --> 00:17:37,002
This question is also to satisfy readers' curiosity?

189
00:17:41,534 --> 00:17:43,293
As a financial journalist,

190
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:45,174
I made this professional judgment after researching

191
00:17:45,255 --> 00:17:46,681
various sources of information.

192
00:17:54,513 --> 00:17:55,652
Shi Yan.

193
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,030
Who is this?

194
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:05,503
Mr. Guan!

195
00:18:06,239 --> 00:18:09,322
Hello, I'm a journalist from Financial Introduce, Zheng Shu Yi.

196
00:18:10,372 --> 00:18:11,592
Do you know me?

197
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:15,815
Although my major in university was journalism, I minored in finance.

198
00:18:15,966 --> 00:18:18,962
Our lecturer mentioned you in the first class of my finance course.

199
00:18:19,197 --> 00:18:22,042
Also, I work with you every day.

200
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,836
On the walls of our office,

201
00:18:24,917 --> 00:18:27,718
there's a cover photo of you and Mr. Shi Wen Guang.

202
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,684
So, your name has been a part of my entire university life.

203
00:18:30,765 --> 00:18:33,925
Your presence accompanies me in my day-to-day work.

204
00:18:34,093 --> 00:18:38,293
Even though you rarely appear in public now, everyone knows about you.

205
00:18:38,374 --> 00:18:40,802
Your reputation remains as unshakable as Mount Tai.

206
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,590
What did you say your name was?

207
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,110
Zheng Shu Yi, right?

208
00:18:48,313 --> 00:18:49,372
Yes.

209
00:18:49,589 --> 00:18:51,573
Zheng Shu Yi.

210
00:18:54,314 --> 00:18:56,202
I seem to remember you.

211
00:18:56,357 --> 00:18:58,027
I've read a few of your articles.

212
00:18:58,155 --> 00:18:59,156
They are well-written.

213
00:18:59,237 --> 00:19:01,002
They have depth and attitude.

214
00:19:01,157 --> 00:19:05,642
I just didn't expect you to be such a young lady in person.

215
00:19:05,837 --> 00:19:06,957
You're too kind.

216
00:19:08,643 --> 00:19:10,784
I thought you were coming alone again.

217
00:19:11,077 --> 00:19:12,477
I didn't prepare anything.

218
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,550
Miss Zheng, this isn't my fault.

219
00:19:14,803 --> 00:19:17,982
This guy has never brought any lady here before.

220
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:22,245
- Uncle Guan, actually she is...   - Oh my...

221
00:19:23,169 --> 00:19:25,522
It's so beautiful here.

222
00:19:26,037 --> 00:19:27,868
These horses are so beautiful too.

223
00:19:32,676 --> 00:19:36,236
Mr. Guan, I heard your biggest hobby is equestrian sports.

224
00:19:36,317 --> 00:19:37,866
You must have quite a few horses, right?

225
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,549
These aren't my best horses.

226
00:19:40,957 --> 00:19:43,197
The best ones are inside.

227
00:19:44,117 --> 00:19:45,378
There are more?

228
00:19:45,581 --> 00:19:46,922
Would you like to see them?

229
00:19:48,532 --> 00:19:51,145
Shi Yan, show Miss Zheng around.

230
00:19:51,961 --> 00:19:53,141
Come with me.

231
00:20:02,837 --> 00:20:03,837
What's wrong?

232
00:20:03,917 --> 00:20:05,522
Is there a problem, Mr. Shi?

233
00:20:05,767 --> 00:20:08,442
Mr. Guan invited me in.

234
00:20:17,237 --> 00:20:18,642
What are you afraid of?

235
00:20:19,027 --> 00:20:21,926
He can't possibly mix me with horse fodder and feed me to the horses?

236
00:20:33,664 --> 00:20:35,174
I'm going inside to change my clothes.

237
00:20:37,034 --> 00:20:38,133
I'll wait for you.

238
00:20:43,077 --> 00:20:44,297
Shi Yan went in?

239
00:20:48,379 --> 00:20:50,210
How long have you known Shi Yan?

240
00:20:50,593 --> 00:20:51,932
Not long.

241
00:20:55,396 --> 00:20:56,577
It does seem like it.

242
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,002
Can you ride a horse?

243
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:01,333
No.

244
00:21:03,247 --> 00:21:05,836
My wife's old riding clothes are inside.

245
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:08,402
If you don't mind, you can wear them.

246
00:21:08,506 --> 00:21:11,004
Since you're here, why not give it a try?

247
00:21:11,468 --> 00:21:12,567
Really?

248
00:21:16,077 --> 00:21:17,138
This way.

249
00:21:40,957 --> 00:21:43,076
My wife's figure is about the same as you,

250
00:21:43,157 --> 00:21:44,477
so this should be suitable.

251
00:21:45,148 --> 00:21:46,289
Thank you, Mr. Guan.

252
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:47,775
I'll wait for you guys outside.

253
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:02,876
No sound?

254
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,839
He's probably left already.

255
00:22:59,027 --> 00:23:00,408
Mr. Shi!

256
00:23:03,837 --> 00:23:06,238
I don't know how to wear this belt.

257
00:23:06,317 --> 00:23:07,727
Can you teach me?

258
00:24:14,597 --> 00:24:16,282
(She's trying to trick me.)

259
00:24:21,196 --> 00:24:22,987
If you don't know how to wear it, don't ride.

260
00:24:33,739 --> 00:24:35,260
Marquez once said,

261
00:24:35,364 --> 00:24:37,524
when a woman wants to pursue a man,

262
00:24:37,605 --> 00:24:39,169
there are no walls she can't cross,

263
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,544
no fortresses she can't topple,

264
00:24:40,625 --> 00:24:41,906
no concerns she can't cast aside,

265
00:24:42,015 --> 00:24:44,082
and not even a God who can control her.

266
00:24:44,179 --> 00:24:46,482
So, am I facing an impregnable fortress now?

267
00:24:46,586 --> 00:24:47,707
Is it a perilous journey?

268
00:24:47,788 --> 00:24:48,988
Is it the wrath of God?

269
00:24:49,069 --> 00:24:50,328
It's none of those.

270
00:24:50,415 --> 00:24:52,270
It's just a small rejection.

271
00:24:53,695 --> 00:24:56,522
Zheng Shu Yi, you can do it. Overcome it.

272
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,780
Come on.

273
00:25:35,877 --> 00:25:37,333
Good.

274
00:25:38,917 --> 00:25:41,587
This is the most docile horse.

275
00:25:42,117 --> 00:25:43,836
Let Shi Yan teach you later.

276
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,197
Come here.

277
00:25:46,477 --> 00:25:47,656
Be careful.

278
00:25:53,465 --> 00:25:56,213
He's a handsome little prince.

279
00:25:59,317 --> 00:26:00,947
Dou Dou is a mare.

280
00:26:04,237 --> 00:26:06,157
Dou Dou is a little princess.

281
00:26:06,237 --> 00:26:07,482
Good girl.

282
00:26:07,662 --> 00:26:10,442
She's so gentle. It seems she really likes me...

283
00:26:11,582 --> 00:26:12,879
Us...

284
00:26:17,196 --> 00:26:19,726
Mr. Shi, please teach me how to ride.

285
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:23,309
Sure.

286
00:26:33,418 --> 00:26:35,729
Mr. Shi, can you lead the horse for me?

287
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:10,402
I have to teach you to ride this way.

288
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:18,042
Relax and learn properly.

289
00:27:19,517 --> 00:27:20,882
Okay.

290
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:24,722
It's my first time riding. I'm a bit nervous.

291
00:28:08,856 --> 00:28:09,956
Sit tight.

292
00:28:10,044 --> 00:28:11,143
What?

293
00:28:14,725 --> 00:28:15,925
Slow down!

294
00:28:16,037 --> 00:28:17,663
Slow down!

295
00:28:43,511 --> 00:28:45,402
What's wrong? Don't want to learn already?

296
00:28:46,334 --> 00:28:47,694
No, I...

297
00:28:47,775 --> 00:28:49,402
I just want to experience it.

298
00:29:06,957 --> 00:29:09,947
Dou Dou is the gentlest horse in the entire stable

299
00:29:10,068 --> 00:29:11,618
and is also very close to you.

300
00:29:12,557 --> 00:29:14,587
I asked you to teach the young lady to ride.

301
00:29:15,206 --> 00:29:17,355
Why did you scare her?

302
00:29:18,894 --> 00:29:20,964
She's bold. She's not easily frightened.

303
00:29:22,215 --> 00:29:23,922
I asked you to unwind at the stable before,

304
00:29:24,005 --> 00:29:25,914
but you said you were too busy and couldn't come.

305
00:29:25,995 --> 00:29:29,282
Why do you suddenly have time today and even brought Miss Zheng along?

306
00:29:36,073 --> 00:29:37,482
I just felt like coming.

307
00:29:37,757 --> 00:29:39,558
This young lady seems quite interesting.

308
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:41,467
She's definitely your type.

309
00:29:43,218 --> 00:29:44,438
Is that so?

310
00:29:45,261 --> 00:29:46,762
There's nothing going on now.

311
00:29:46,877 --> 00:29:50,066
There's nothing now, but there will be something as you progress.

312
00:29:53,037 --> 00:29:56,586
It was so bumpy. Did he do it on purpose?

313
00:29:57,486 --> 00:30:00,242
He even made fun of me in front of Mr. Guan.

314
00:30:00,654 --> 00:30:02,114
Is he even human?

315
00:30:03,237 --> 00:30:05,036
Marquez might not always be right.

316
00:30:05,124 --> 00:30:07,762
At least, I can't even cross the saddle in front of me.

317
00:30:08,229 --> 00:30:09,369
I'm done.

318
00:30:13,517 --> 00:30:14,596
Indeed.

319
00:30:14,677 --> 00:30:17,268
In the beginning, many things might not be anything.

320
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:20,810
But as they develop, there are many possibilities.

321
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,400
You're talking about

322
00:30:23,179 --> 00:30:24,399
Le'an Technology.

323
00:30:26,939 --> 00:30:28,439
Everything else, I guess.

324
00:30:28,795 --> 00:30:30,586
The same principle applies to Yunchuang.

325
00:30:32,037 --> 00:30:34,936
I heard something from Guan Ji.

326
00:30:35,076 --> 00:30:37,476
I was a bit worried about you,

327
00:30:37,557 --> 00:30:39,562
but now it seems I was overly concerned.

328
00:30:40,441 --> 00:30:41,620
Shi Yan,

329
00:30:42,743 --> 00:30:44,254
the path you want to take

330
00:30:44,597 --> 00:30:46,627
is a long and difficult one.

331
00:30:47,342 --> 00:30:51,430
Mingyu just survived a crisis, and you decided to establish Yunchuang.

332
00:30:52,182 --> 00:30:55,663
Tian and others lent a helping hand to Mingyu during the critical moment,

333
00:30:55,789 --> 00:30:57,229
now to you as well.

334
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:59,929
You must remember their kindness.

335
00:31:00,602 --> 00:31:03,832
At this stage, Yunchuang needs stability above all else.

336
00:31:04,579 --> 00:31:06,739
There's no need to upset Tian and the others.

337
00:31:06,849 --> 00:31:09,790
If they're unhappy, it will bring you a lot of trouble.

338
00:31:11,969 --> 00:31:13,070
I remember.

339
00:31:13,293 --> 00:31:14,857
So I have to do better.

340
00:31:14,975 --> 00:31:18,544
As long as the decisions are right, any unhappiness will only be temporary.

341
00:31:22,749 --> 00:31:25,521
I've also heard about Lieying.

342
00:31:26,892 --> 00:31:31,651
Your investment in them, to some extent, was a good choice.

343
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:34,641
Once Guan Capital's funds are involved,

344
00:31:35,243 --> 00:31:37,869
Yunchuang can invest in both companies.

345
00:31:38,102 --> 00:31:39,382
No need to create unnecessary tension.

346
00:31:39,463 --> 00:31:41,322
They're all old friends of your father.

347
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,771
There's no need to embarrass them.

348
00:31:45,572 --> 00:31:48,211
Uncle Guan, I understand what you mean.

349
00:31:48,292 --> 00:31:50,442
But Yunchuang is still very young.

350
00:31:50,523 --> 00:31:54,322
I hope it remains purer and focuses on doing one thing well.

351
00:31:54,542 --> 00:31:58,911
I don't want to change our thoughts and intentions just to please others.

352
00:32:00,662 --> 00:32:03,029
It's precisely because of Mingyu's crisis

353
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,470
that I realized

354
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:08,733
a modern company needs a more professional and pure management approach.

355
00:32:12,357 --> 00:32:13,837
Yue is back, right?

356
00:32:13,917 --> 00:32:15,258
What has she been busy with lately?

357
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,540
She came back a few days ago.

358
00:32:17,723 --> 00:32:20,201
She's been doing nothing and wasting her life away.

359
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:24,242
I'm planning to find her a job to give her some experience.

360
00:32:25,157 --> 00:32:27,067
You just said it yourself.

361
00:32:27,388 --> 00:32:31,469
Sometimes, some people might not be anything at first, right?

362
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:34,385
But as they develop, there are many possibilities.

363
00:32:34,751 --> 00:32:37,381
Yue is a smart girl.

364
00:32:37,518 --> 00:32:40,269
Train her well, and she can become great.

365
00:32:41,299 --> 00:32:42,520
Perhaps.

366
00:32:42,797 --> 00:32:46,547
I just don't know how to initiate these possibilities yet.

367
00:32:47,117 --> 00:32:50,388
Why don't you let her join Guan Capital?

368
00:32:52,075 --> 00:32:53,744
Let her work for Guan Ji?

369
00:32:53,964 --> 00:32:56,164
I wonder who will be working for whom.

370
00:32:56,245 --> 00:32:59,002
You know Guan Ji always spoils her.

371
00:33:01,693 --> 00:33:03,122
You're right.

372
00:33:03,332 --> 00:33:04,882
If you really want to train her,

373
00:33:05,014 --> 00:33:07,964
she needs to go to a completely unfamiliar environment.

374
00:33:08,228 --> 00:33:11,642
This little brat is good at neither academics nor sports.

375
00:33:11,774 --> 00:33:13,484
Which company would want her?

376
00:33:13,796 --> 00:33:16,835
Are they going to hire her to become a mascot?

377
00:33:16,923 --> 00:33:18,594
Don't speak about her like that.

378
00:33:18,774 --> 00:33:21,421
Yue is smart, cheerful, emotionally intelligent

379
00:33:21,502 --> 00:33:23,412
and willing to chat with people.

380
00:33:24,326 --> 00:33:27,362
You could let her try being a journalist.

381
00:33:27,869 --> 00:33:29,638
Didn't she study journalism overseas?

382
00:33:29,719 --> 00:33:31,202
Her major matches the job description.

383
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,560
Journalist?

384
00:33:34,797 --> 00:33:36,178
For people like her?

385
00:33:36,277 --> 00:33:40,348
What do you think a journalist should be like?

386
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:04,522
I think you could win an Oscar for Best Actor in China.

387
00:34:04,715 --> 00:34:06,306
You're acting as if

388
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:09,241
you're not the one who just did that kind of thing.

389
00:34:16,757 --> 00:34:19,378
Maybe we can let her try.

390
00:34:19,732 --> 00:34:21,072
Let her try.

391
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:24,168
I happen to have a journalist friend who can help.

392
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:28,147
Uncle Guan, are you acquainted with journalists too?

393
00:34:29,579 --> 00:34:31,362
Journalists are acquainted with me.

394
00:34:34,479 --> 00:34:36,360
Still looking at me.

395
00:34:36,597 --> 00:34:38,802
You just want to see me embarrassed.

396
00:34:39,145 --> 00:34:40,486
Fine, go ahead.

397
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:42,109
You don't have many chances left.

398
00:34:42,196 --> 00:34:44,122
Don't even think about seeing me again in the future.

399
00:34:53,045 --> 00:34:54,202
Where is Chen Sheng?

400
00:34:54,637 --> 00:34:55,642
Mr. Shi,

401
00:34:55,733 --> 00:34:58,793
Mr. Chen said he had to attend to urgent matters in the company and left.

402
00:35:01,236 --> 00:35:02,517
Send Miss Zheng home first.

403
00:35:02,628 --> 00:35:03,767
Okay.

404
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,842
(Doesn't he get hungry?)

405
00:35:14,313 --> 00:35:17,584
(We interviewed for two hours and rode horses all afternoon.)

406
00:35:17,725 --> 00:35:19,766
(I wouldn't mind if he forgot to eat, )

407
00:35:19,877 --> 00:35:22,577
(but he lacks basic hospitality skills.)

408
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:25,969
(If he didn't want to invite me for a meal, I could have treated him.)

409
00:35:34,117 --> 00:35:36,837
(But the way he looks when he's working)

410
00:35:36,918 --> 00:35:39,002
(is quite charming.)

411
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,122
Sorry, where is Mr. Shi?

412
00:36:58,469 --> 00:37:00,402
Mr. Shi had something to attend to and left first.

413
00:37:03,197 --> 00:37:04,878
Fan, I'll leave in a moment.

414
00:37:04,988 --> 00:37:06,247
Send her home.

415
00:37:09,597 --> 00:37:11,919
After she wakes up, see if she needs anything.

416
00:37:12,513 --> 00:37:14,042
Make sure she gets home safely.

417
00:37:14,234 --> 00:37:15,415
Okay, Mr. Shi.

418
00:37:19,075 --> 00:37:20,536
No, thanks.

419
00:37:22,877 --> 00:37:25,417
(What strange hospitality.)

420
00:37:25,837 --> 00:37:28,273
(He's thoughtful but impatient.)

421
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,603
(He left the car for me and ran off. What is this?)

422
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,965
How did I end up falling asleep in the interviewee's car?

423
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:46,602
And my interviewee was Shi Yan.

424
00:37:46,981 --> 00:37:49,282
This never happened before.

425
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,249
This is so unprofessional.

426
00:37:52,219 --> 00:37:53,540
I was sleeping soundly.

427
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,772
I wonder if I embarrassed myself.

428
00:38:04,477 --> 00:38:05,557
Never mind.

429
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,522
The earrings only cost 25 yuan each.

430
00:38:07,606 --> 00:38:10,317
Consider it a gift to him for teaching me.

431
00:38:19,677 --> 00:38:20,717
Mr. Shi,

432
00:38:20,779 --> 00:38:23,912
thank you so much for coming over to meet with me at this hour.

433
00:38:23,993 --> 00:38:25,092
Have a seat.

434
00:38:26,533 --> 00:38:27,652
But...

435
00:38:27,823 --> 00:38:30,362
For some matters, I really have no control over it.

436
00:38:30,557 --> 00:38:32,722
After all, Le'an isn't mine alone.

437
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:35,287
I can't just consider my own dream.

438
00:38:35,963 --> 00:38:37,102
I understand.

439
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:39,962
What Lieying can give you, Yunchuang can certainly offer you as well.

440
00:38:40,173 --> 00:38:41,294
You should understand this.

441
00:38:41,445 --> 00:38:44,005
It's precisely because of Yunchuang's sincerity towards Le'an

442
00:38:44,109 --> 00:38:46,789
that Lieying offered an acquisition price of 50 million to Le'an.

443
00:38:46,885 --> 00:38:49,042
I understand, but...

444
00:38:49,221 --> 00:38:53,222
Fifty million is highly attractive to Le'an at the current stage.

445
00:38:54,613 --> 00:38:58,393
Mr. Chen, you should also know Lieying is still seeking our investment.

446
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:02,300
Leaving aside whether they have sufficient funds for this acquisition,

447
00:39:02,446 --> 00:39:03,565
from a long-term perspective,

448
00:39:03,676 --> 00:39:07,242
your team shouldn't be restricted by an integrated company at this stage.

449
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,919
Yunchuang wants to work with Le'an to build Chinese chips.

450
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:12,269
So, what suits Le'an best at this stage

451
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,562
is definitely financing, not being acquired.

452
00:39:14,983 --> 00:39:17,722
Mr. Shi, you know our value,

453
00:39:18,496 --> 00:39:21,342
but we've been discussing it with Yunchuang for some time now.

454
00:39:21,441 --> 00:39:23,197
There has been no progress on our collaboration.

455
00:39:23,259 --> 00:39:26,082
Our team urgently needs funds for breakthroughs now.

456
00:39:26,265 --> 00:39:28,446
I can't answer to my team.

457
00:39:30,803 --> 00:39:33,782
Give me some time. I'll expedite the collaboration details.

458
00:39:33,924 --> 00:39:35,753
Let's solve these issues together.

459
00:40:04,357 --> 00:40:06,397
(My legs have been bruised by the saddle.)

460
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,343
(I'm getting extremely exhausted just for an article.)

461
00:40:09,737 --> 00:40:11,328
(This is so tough.)

462
00:40:19,321 --> 00:40:21,741
(Come on, let's go for a massage.)

463
00:40:22,844 --> 00:40:25,434
(I can't, I need to finish my article.)

464
00:41:43,557 --> 00:41:45,750
Nice article. Thanks for your hard work.

465
00:41:46,453 --> 00:41:48,402
Not hard at all. I enjoyed writing it.

466
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:52,058
Why? Do you want to talk about something else?

467
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:56,889
Ms. Yi, I do have some ideas.

468
00:41:57,179 --> 00:42:00,258
During this interview, Shi Yan expressed many innovative views

469
00:42:00,339 --> 00:42:02,530
that could attract many young readers.

470
00:42:02,757 --> 00:42:06,637
But he has always been low-key, so many people are curious about him.

471
00:42:06,826 --> 00:42:10,908
So, I want to feature Shi Yan's audio in the digital magazine.

472
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,339
Shu Yi, it's a good idea.

473
00:42:16,419 --> 00:42:19,671
But it's not easy to upgrade a digital magazine.

474
00:42:19,987 --> 00:42:21,522
We need a lot of manpower and financial resources.

475
00:42:21,603 --> 00:42:24,591
Like the audio you mentioned earlier, who will produce it?

476
00:42:25,527 --> 00:42:27,087
I understand, Ms. Yi.

477
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:30,512
That's why we must keep up with readers' reading and consumption habits,

478
00:42:30,628 --> 00:42:31,787
even leading them.

479
00:42:31,899 --> 00:42:34,202
Then only we can increase revenue and upgrade the magazine.

480
00:42:34,283 --> 00:42:36,859
Once we upgrade the magazine and offer a more diverse presentation style,

481
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:39,179
it can enhance readers' reading experience

482
00:42:39,267 --> 00:42:40,800
and provide effective interaction.

483
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:43,292
Only then will they be willing to pay for our content.

484
00:42:43,413 --> 00:42:47,162
Once we generate revenue, we can upgrade and redesign the magazine.

485
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:49,580
As for audio production,

486
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:51,562
I've learned some basics online,

487
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,450
so I can manage for now.

488
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:56,404
You're really persistent.

489
00:42:57,037 --> 00:42:59,106
Let me talk to the editor-in-chief first.

490
00:42:59,197 --> 00:43:00,958
I'll try to let you attempt this.

491
00:43:01,744 --> 00:43:02,842
Thank you, Ms. Yi.
