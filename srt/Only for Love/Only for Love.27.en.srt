00:01:31,002 --> 00:01:36,002
(Only For Love)

2
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:39,002
(Episode 27)

3
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,760
Mom. Dad. I'm going out for a bit.

4
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,642
So early? Where are you going?

5
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:29,109
Not eating with us?

6
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,001
No, I'm not. I'm leaving.

7
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,642
Why haven't you replied to me yet?

8
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,032
Once you finish the infusion, return to the hotel to rest.

9
00:03:28,113 --> 00:03:29,402
We're going home.

10
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:33,719
Weren't we just here yesterday?

11
00:03:33,823 --> 00:03:35,222
Why are we going home already?

12
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,790
You're sick.

13
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,120
Actually, I'm still okay.

14
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,870
Then, why are you in the hospital?

15
00:03:48,372 --> 00:03:49,717
We just got here,

16
00:03:49,798 --> 00:03:51,957
and I have to leave without doing anything.

17
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,241
I have to go back to work when I get home.

18
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,442
Don't go.

19
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,439
No. I don't mean that.

20
00:04:02,981 --> 00:04:04,902
I like this job.

21
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:09,242
It taught me a lot and helped me grow.

22
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,280
If you're sick, don't go.

23
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,229
Stay home and rest.

24
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,159
Uncle, you are right.

25
00:04:23,348 --> 00:04:24,698
Well,

26
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,041
I'll take a few days off and rest at home.

27
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,710
I'll sit in the passenger seat.

28
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:18,373
Hello, miss. I wanted to ask if there is

29
00:05:18,454 --> 00:05:19,962
a patient named Qin Shi Yue.

30
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,562
After completing the infusion, she was taken home by her family.

31
00:05:24,871 --> 00:05:26,772
- Okay, thank you.   - You're welcome.

32
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,522
She left.

33
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,850
Are you feeling better now?

34
00:05:50,014 --> 00:05:52,122
(I'm at the hospital. Where are you?)

35
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,442
Yi.

36
00:06:16,422 --> 00:06:18,562
The sun is already out. You...

37
00:06:21,151 --> 00:06:23,151
The sun just came out from the west.

38
00:06:26,117 --> 00:06:28,236
What's wrong? Not in a good mood?

39
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,968
Nothing. Mom, you go out first.

40
00:06:32,049 --> 00:06:33,402
I'm going to change clothes.

41
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,839
You should go show your daughter some care.

42
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,040
It's the Lunar New Year. Why is she getting up so early?

43
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,762
It's like she's possessed.

44
00:06:55,084 --> 00:06:56,883
If she gets up late, you'd want to scold her.

45
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,118
When she gets up early, you're still not satisfied.

46
00:06:59,198 --> 00:07:01,998
I think you're just looking for trouble.

47
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,726
In two days, when your daughter goes to Jiangcheng,

48
00:07:05,461 --> 00:07:07,221
you will surely miss her.

49
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,282
- Can't you keep quiet?   - Fine.

50
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:14,469
Mom and Dad, I have something to do tonight. I won't be back for dinner.

51
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,801
It seems that she is in a rather bad mood.

52
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,519
She's my biological daughter. How can I not know?

53
00:09:04,181 --> 00:09:08,795
(Qing'an Ocean World)

54
00:09:42,174 --> 00:09:44,293
Let's go back to the aquarium.

55
00:09:45,078 --> 00:09:46,428
Okay, Mr. Shi.

56
00:10:20,415 --> 00:10:23,015
You're not coming?

57
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,040
Come to act with you?

58
00:10:45,997 --> 00:10:47,878
(It's okay.)

59
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,136
(Isn't that what you said?)

60
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:52,522
(Only by deeply understanding your interviewee)

61
00:10:52,603 --> 00:10:55,202
(can you write a more profound interview article.)

62
00:10:58,486 --> 00:10:59,836
Sorry.

63
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,483
Sorry.

64
00:11:25,701 --> 00:11:27,560
(You have your own career)

65
00:11:27,641 --> 00:11:29,561
(and you love your career.)

66
00:11:29,881 --> 00:11:31,679
(When you focus on your work, )

67
00:11:31,805 --> 00:11:34,206
(you radiate a brilliant light.)

68
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,501
(And, all the pride I have in our relationship)

69
00:11:38,582 --> 00:11:40,222
(is nothing compared to it.)

70
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:46,079
(I also once felt lost and helpless because of your radiance.)

71
00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:51,362
(But, I know that it was that ray that drew me to you.)

72
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,150
(I hope your radiance becomes increasingly dazzling.)

73
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:57,159
(My radiance is also becoming more dazzling)

74
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,842
(so that it can shine with yours, )

75
00:11:58,923 --> 00:12:00,283
(and no one else can fit in.)

76
00:12:03,615 --> 00:12:04,965
(Shi Yan.)

77
00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:06,959
(I will definitely love you well.)

78
00:12:07,054 --> 00:12:08,404
(I won't let you down.)

79
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,718
She's already in her 20s.

80
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,599
Coming back and just sleeping all day.

81
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,602
What's the difference between her and a pig?

82
00:12:33,607 --> 00:12:35,081
It's the Lunar New Year.

83
00:12:35,162 --> 00:12:36,479
She just keeps sleeping all day.

84
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,642
I think she's going to stay in bed forever.

85
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,726
She does not come to help.

86
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,081
She is so lazy.

87
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:45,682
I have no idea how she spent her days in Jiangcheng.

88
00:12:46,646 --> 00:12:48,446
What are you worrying so much for?

89
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,080
Children will have their own blessings.

90
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:53,119
You didn't give birth to her.

91
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,680
Naturally, you don't worry.

92
00:12:54,761 --> 00:12:56,042
That's right.

93
00:12:56,189 --> 00:12:59,589
Hopefully, your daughter is someone blessed.

94
00:12:59,748 --> 00:13:01,190
She could find someone to serve her.

95
00:13:01,271 --> 00:13:03,351
Otherwise, she'll starve to death sooner or later.

96
00:13:03,636 --> 00:13:05,388
Right.

97
00:13:10,342 --> 00:13:11,692
You...

98
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,439
Time to eat. Get up.

99
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,870
Do I have to invite you?

100
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,350
Hurry up.

101
00:13:39,469 --> 00:13:41,669
Girl. Come on. Eat more.

102
00:13:41,847 --> 00:13:43,368
Taste your dad's cooking.

103
00:13:43,967 --> 00:13:46,039
I wrapped it. No, I rolled it.

104
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,920
What did you wrap?

105
00:13:56,482 --> 00:13:57,682
I'm full.

106
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,300
Going to sleep so early?

107
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,119
You've been sleeping all day.

108
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,640
Are you going to be a sleeping god?

109
00:14:04,826 --> 00:14:06,651
I stayed up all night watching dramas.

110
00:14:06,732 --> 00:14:08,559
I'm so tired. Don't worry about me.

111
00:14:08,654 --> 00:14:10,680
Of course I have to worry about you.

112
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,117
You little girl.

113
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:16,848
I have a date with the dean to play mahjong tomorrow.

114
00:14:16,942 --> 00:14:18,549
I'm going to her house for dinner in the evening.

115
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:20,070
Do you want to come along?

116
00:14:20,413 --> 00:14:21,892
You have been back for a few days already.

117
00:14:21,973 --> 00:14:23,334
You haven't seen Yu You yet.

118
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,070
I'm not going.

119
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:26,514
Not going?

120
00:14:27,383 --> 00:14:31,368
Can you get a boyfriend from bed or in a dream?

121
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,892
Yu You is such a good kid.

122
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:35,479
There are so many young girls going after him.

123
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,806
You only sleep all day

124
00:14:36,887 --> 00:14:38,277
and don't maintain the relationship.

125
00:14:38,358 --> 00:14:40,278
Pies don't fall from the sky.

126
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,795
Children will have their own blessings.

127
00:14:52,876 --> 00:14:54,477
What are you worrying about so much?

128
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,682
Shut up.

129
00:14:58,519 --> 00:14:59,679
Hurry up and eat something.

130
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,482
Making dumplings is not easy.

131
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,402
They even come with chives filling.

132
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:14,861
She slept all day yesterday.

133
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:16,990
Now, she won't come out to eat breakfast.

134
00:15:18,246 --> 00:15:20,405
It seems like something's really wrong.

135
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,356
I'll go take a look at her.

136
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,990
Yi.

137
00:15:37,754 --> 00:15:40,475
Did something happen?

138
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,830
Are you running a fever?

139
00:15:47,189 --> 00:15:48,402
Well, you're not.

140
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,201
Is work not going well?

141
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,802
Or did something else happen?

142
00:16:00,846 --> 00:16:02,362
If the work is not going well,

143
00:16:02,463 --> 00:16:03,864
there's always a way to solve it.

144
00:16:04,495 --> 00:16:07,064
If it really doesn't work, talk to your dad.

145
00:16:07,486 --> 00:16:10,322
Your dad can solve any problem.

146
00:16:11,249 --> 00:16:15,002
If you really can't make it there in the big city,

147
00:16:15,218 --> 00:16:16,322
just come back here.

148
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:18,249
Qing'an is such a beautiful place.

149
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,538
We can buy you a house and a car.

150
00:16:20,712 --> 00:16:23,962
We can still live a comfortable life.

151
00:16:31,061 --> 00:16:34,460
If you have relationship problems,

152
00:16:35,309 --> 00:16:37,468
just grit your teeth and get through it.

153
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,880
You're still young.

154
00:16:40,093 --> 00:16:42,282
You'll meet many more people in the future.

155
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,400
There's no one who's irreplaceable.

156
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:47,122
Wait a few more years.

157
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,962
You'll have your own children and family.

158
00:16:50,302 --> 00:16:54,722
When you look back, those unforgettable memories

159
00:16:55,429 --> 00:16:58,802
will fade away with time.

160
00:16:59,325 --> 00:17:01,716
The effect is even briefer than that of semi-permanent eyebrows.

161
00:17:02,353 --> 00:17:03,482
Mom.

162
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,760
I did something wrong.

163
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:08,257
Then, so be it.

164
00:17:08,356 --> 00:17:10,275
Who doesn't make mistakes when they're young?

165
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,241
Just don't repeat it in the future.

166
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:15,270
There's no future.

167
00:17:16,158 --> 00:17:17,399
Silly girl.

168
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,830
Why talk like this?

169
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,439
What do you mean by "no future"?

170
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,039
Time is hope.

171
00:17:23,403 --> 00:17:26,002
Life is still hopeful.

172
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,070
Feeling better?

173
00:17:33,335 --> 00:17:34,919
If so, hurry up and get up.

174
00:17:35,048 --> 00:17:37,318
What do you look like lying in bed all day?

175
00:17:37,803 --> 00:17:39,631
Oh yeah. Remember to forward the voting link

176
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,320
for the most popular teacher at Qing'an to your friends

177
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,950
so your friends can vote for me.

178
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,404
Bruce is really ruthless.

179
00:18:02,352 --> 00:18:03,872
Nothing is really progressing now.

180
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,476
She's really ruthless

181
00:18:12,902 --> 00:18:14,262
and ungrateful.

182
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:33,479
Qing'an University.

183
00:18:35,867 --> 00:18:41,812
(Qing'an University)

184
00:18:42,631 --> 00:18:43,633
Hello.

185
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,390
Who is this?

186
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,520
Who are you?

187
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,480
Hello, Auntie. I'm Yi Yang.

188
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,910
I'm looking for Shu Yi.

189
00:18:56,991 --> 00:18:58,562
Looking for Yi?

190
00:18:59,633 --> 00:19:02,442
Young boy, I've never seen you before.

191
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,810
I haven't heard her mention anything about you.

192
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,002
I just got to know Shu Yi not long ago.

193
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,270
I want to meet Shu Yi.

194
00:19:11,101 --> 00:19:12,500
Boy.

195
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,160
Is it you?

196
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:18,414
Are you having a conflict with her and making her upset?

197
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,031
Me? No, it's not me.

198
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,799
You look quite young.

199
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,230
Younger than Yi, right?

200
00:19:24,617 --> 00:19:26,119
Being young isn't an excuse.

201
00:19:26,281 --> 00:19:29,120
Someone has to take the initiative in a relationship.

202
00:19:29,312 --> 00:19:30,575
But, neither of you did.

203
00:19:30,656 --> 00:19:31,922
How can there be a future then?

204
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:34,522
You must never be proactive while pursuing Yi,

205
00:19:34,603 --> 00:19:36,320
but take her for granted once you got her.

206
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,682
No, Auntie. I didn't.

207
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,920
Fortunately, it's not too late yet.

208
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,439
Next time, you must cheer her up on the spot.

209
00:19:42,952 --> 00:19:45,122
No. That's not right. There can't be a next time.

210
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:48,077
Yi has been spoiled since she was young.

211
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,842
She has always been very good.

212
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,362
It's inevitable that she's a little arrogant.

213
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,882
But she is a simple person with a soft heart.

214
00:19:56,219 --> 00:19:58,559
You should have a better attitude.

215
00:19:58,781 --> 00:19:59,926
Coax her a little bit.

216
00:20:00,007 --> 00:20:01,687
She won't be angry then.

217
00:20:02,899 --> 00:20:05,308
Did you understand what I said?

218
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,441
Yes, I understand.

219
00:20:07,718 --> 00:20:09,602
Then, come in quickly.

220
00:20:09,878 --> 00:20:11,557
Come. Sit down quickly.

221
00:20:11,967 --> 00:20:14,208
Yi. Look who's here!

222
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:16,565
Who?

223
00:20:22,659 --> 00:20:24,009
Why it's you?

224
00:20:24,196 --> 00:20:25,356
How did you come?

225
00:20:25,437 --> 00:20:27,522
Zheng Shu Yi. Happy Lunar New Year.

226
00:20:30,045 --> 00:20:31,395
Happy Lunar New Year.

227
00:20:32,466 --> 00:20:33,466
Yi.

228
00:20:33,547 --> 00:20:36,560
Yi Yang came all the way from Jiangcheng to see you.

229
00:20:36,671 --> 00:20:38,722
You must treat him well.

230
00:20:38,836 --> 00:20:40,080
Your dad went fishing.

231
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,346
And I have a date to play mahjong.

232
00:20:42,427 --> 00:20:43,682
I'll leave first.

233
00:20:43,805 --> 00:20:45,421
When did you have a date to play mahjong?

234
00:20:45,502 --> 00:20:47,692
- Weren't you...   - Thank you, Auntie.

235
00:20:59,381 --> 00:21:01,301
Qing'an isn't big. Have a look at the travel plans.

236
00:21:01,382 --> 00:21:03,023
Where do you want to go? I'll help you out.

237
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,334
There's a high-speed train back to Jiangcheng tomorrow.

238
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:12,109
I have something to do. I can't accompany you.

239
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,682
Are you hungry?

240
00:21:21,206 --> 00:21:23,356
Try it and see if it suits your taste.

241
00:21:43,215 --> 00:21:44,565
Why did you come to Qing'an?

242
00:21:46,423 --> 00:21:49,322
You must know that I came to Qing'an for you, right?

243
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:58,469
You must know that I came to Qing'an for you, right?

244
00:22:01,943 --> 00:22:03,293
Zheng Shu Yi.

245
00:22:04,168 --> 00:22:07,449
A man traveling a thousand miles just to see you during the Lunar New Year.

246
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,398
There must be no other reason.

247
00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:15,019
Stop it, little brother.

248
00:22:15,192 --> 00:22:16,633
Go home when you're done messing around.

249
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,949
If you like, you can call me little brother.

250
00:22:22,438 --> 00:22:23,602
Zheng Shu Yi.

251
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,888
If you reject me because of this reason,

252
00:22:26,643 --> 00:22:28,203
I feel a bit unfair.

253
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:31,762
Yes. You're right.

254
00:22:31,938 --> 00:22:33,042
Sorry.

255
00:22:33,526 --> 00:22:35,086
But there's really no way.

256
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:37,482
Do I still have no chance even after you broke up with Shi Yan?

257
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,380
Who said we're breaking up?

258
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,401
After eating, take me to your high school to have a look.

259
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,710
Let's go. The door isn't open.

260
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,880
What does your expression mean?

261
00:23:13,247 --> 00:23:14,686
It's a bit regretful

262
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:16,949
because

263
00:23:17,309 --> 00:23:20,230
I want to know your past and what you were like.

264
00:23:22,405 --> 00:23:23,755
Shu Yi.

265
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,870
I hope you can take this opportunity to consider me.

266
00:23:29,602 --> 00:23:30,800
Yi Yang.

267
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:32,442
This isn't an opportunity.

268
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:34,362
I already have someone in my heart.

269
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:35,679
I know.

270
00:23:35,783 --> 00:23:37,903
- But he's already left.   - He's gone.

271
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:40,282
I can wait or I can pursue him.

272
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,396
You can pursue him,

273
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:45,909
and I can catch up too.

274
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,110
Can you ride a bike?

275
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,842
Let's have a race.

276
00:24:16,674 --> 00:24:18,941
Yi Yang, thanks for today.

277
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,510
How do you want to thank me?

278
00:24:22,932 --> 00:24:25,653
How about giving me a chance to pursue you?

279
00:24:27,542 --> 00:24:29,182
I'm not negotiating with you.

280
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:30,694
No bargaining.

281
00:25:13,503 --> 00:25:14,722
Let's stop.

282
00:25:15,149 --> 00:25:18,842
I didn't expect three high-quality men like us would end up like this.

283
00:25:42,671 --> 00:25:44,951
(Are you feeling better?)

284
00:26:16,412 --> 00:26:18,242
(When I went to the hospital that day, )

285
00:26:18,691 --> 00:26:21,332
(the nurse said you had already left.)

286
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,270
(It's the Lunar New Year.)

287
00:26:32,617 --> 00:26:34,203
(After enduring all these streaks of bad luck, )

288
00:26:34,286 --> 00:26:36,055
(things are about to turn around, aren't they?)

289
00:26:36,388 --> 00:26:37,738
(Hospital?)

290
00:26:38,731 --> 00:26:40,132
I have something to do. I'm leaving first.

291
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,450
(Which hospital are you at?)

292
00:27:23,002 --> 00:27:24,352
(What's wrong with you?)

293
00:27:24,597 --> 00:27:25,947
(Answer the phone quickly.)

294
00:28:17,454 --> 00:28:20,235
I think it should be this pink one and the blue one before. Right?

295
00:28:20,316 --> 00:28:21,482
Are you okay?

296
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,322
Me? What's wrong with me?

297
00:28:26,428 --> 00:28:29,042
Didn't you say you were at the hospital?

298
00:28:30,879 --> 00:28:32,082
I'm fine.

299
00:28:35,782 --> 00:28:36,990
Come with me.

300
00:28:37,071 --> 00:28:39,522
Let her go. Who are you to take her away?

301
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,421
Let her go.

302
00:28:41,789 --> 00:28:43,115
- None of your business.   - It's okay, Nian Nian.

303
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,731
- What?   - Friend.

304
00:29:04,168 --> 00:29:05,528
Are you going to marry him?

305
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,079
What does it have to do with you?

306
00:29:12,655 --> 00:29:14,005
Shan Shan.

307
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,160
Don't marry him.

308
00:29:18,782 --> 00:29:20,813
I can give you whatever he can give.

309
00:29:22,606 --> 00:29:24,686
Do you know what are you talking about?

310
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,200
Love isn't something to be auctioned off.

311
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,710
It's not something you can get by raising the stakes.

312
00:29:33,739 --> 00:29:35,089
Well...

313
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,030
Do you like me?

314
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,750
Let me answer first.

315
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,642
Bi Ruo Shan.

316
00:29:54,037 --> 00:29:55,387
I really like you.

317
00:30:00,213 --> 00:30:02,173
Actually, when I was very young,

318
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,920
I watched my parents get divorced.

319
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,890
At that time,

320
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,002
my mom told my dad

321
00:30:10,507 --> 00:30:12,777
that she didn't want to waste their passion anymore.

322
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,380
She was tired of it.

323
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,362
No matter how good my dad was,

324
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,800
she wanted to give up on the marriage.

325
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,550
These images

326
00:30:25,029 --> 00:30:27,338
were deeply imprinted in my mind.

327
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:33,909
Since then,

328
00:30:35,302 --> 00:30:38,181
I felt that marriage wasn't the end of a relationship.

329
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,320
Every relationship eventually withers.

330
00:30:42,231 --> 00:30:44,551
The only thing that can stay fresh and last long

331
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,560
might be an on-and-off relationship.

332
00:30:48,989 --> 00:30:50,122
So,

333
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,882
I always followed our game rules to get along.

334
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:54,997
It's not because I liked this kind of relationship,

335
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,680
but because this way I wouldn't lose you at least.

336
00:31:02,911 --> 00:31:04,710
After you rejected me last time,

337
00:31:05,523 --> 00:31:08,243
I thought we should just part ways.

338
00:31:10,587 --> 00:31:11,937
But,

339
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,191
even if I could fool everyone, I couldn't fool myself.

340
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,082
Shan Shan.

341
00:31:30,667 --> 00:31:34,348
I long to meet you somewhere other than a bar or a hotel.

342
00:31:36,288 --> 00:31:39,077
I want to go on dates with you like a normal couple.

343
00:31:40,874 --> 00:31:42,582
I want to build a relationship with you

344
00:31:42,663 --> 00:31:44,522
that gives us both a sense of security.

345
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,040
I can get sad too.

346
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,202
But I'm willing to expose my most vulnerable side to you.

347
00:31:54,404 --> 00:31:55,754
Shan Shan,

348
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,800
I can lose everything else,

349
00:32:01,302 --> 00:32:02,962
but I can't lose you.

350
00:32:06,412 --> 00:32:09,361
I'm willing to give you my most precious thing

351
00:32:10,188 --> 00:32:12,268
in exchange for the chance to be with you.

352
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:14,429
But

353
00:32:16,286 --> 00:32:20,487
we're both not good at maintaining a devoted and long-term relationship.

354
00:32:29,372 --> 00:32:30,962
I'm willing to work hard

355
00:32:32,385 --> 00:32:33,602
for you,

356
00:32:34,933 --> 00:32:36,283
for us.

357
00:32:37,916 --> 00:32:39,677
Can we work hard together?

358
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:50,920
I won't marry you then.

359
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,719
I'm not ready to get married yet.

360
00:33:11,223 --> 00:33:13,462
None of us has ever been in a serious relationship.

361
00:33:15,681 --> 00:33:17,561
Let's start with dating.

362
00:33:54,878 --> 00:33:57,797
During work, work is the top priority.

363
00:33:58,153 --> 00:34:00,162
Zheng Shu Yi, you can do it.

364
00:34:02,613 --> 00:34:04,129
Come, I'm giving everyone some specialties.

365
00:34:04,227 --> 00:34:06,378
- Thank you.   - Thank you, Ai Da.

366
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:10,740
Thank you, Ai Da.

367
00:34:11,511 --> 00:34:14,110
(Shu Yi, I'm still not feeling well.)

368
00:34:14,232 --> 00:34:15,722
(I won't go to work today.)

369
00:34:17,663 --> 00:34:19,162
(Rest well.)

370
00:34:22,221 --> 00:34:23,541
Shu Yi.

371
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,119
What specialties does Qing'an have?

372
00:34:25,223 --> 00:34:26,573
What did you bring back?

373
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,600
Qing'an is famous for its beautiful women.

374
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,110
Do you want me?

375
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,589
You have no shame.

376
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,670
Shan Shan,

377
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:09,160
he knows everything.

378
00:35:09,851 --> 00:35:11,145
Have you come back?

379
00:35:11,226 --> 00:35:12,559
Can I go to your place?

380
00:35:12,718 --> 00:35:15,548
What's the problem? You can stay as long as you want

381
00:35:15,629 --> 00:35:17,579
so you don't have to be alone and think too much.

382
00:35:17,901 --> 00:35:20,010
Okay. I'm waiting for you.

383
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,840
Hey, baby.

384
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,639
I won't be able to have dinner with you today.

385
00:35:34,718 --> 00:35:37,240
How many days? I'll miss you.

386
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,364
(I don't know.)

387
00:35:38,445 --> 00:35:40,664
Why don't you ask her to go back? I'm used to sleeping in your bed.

388
00:35:40,745 --> 00:35:41,745
(No way.)

389
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:43,560
I don't care.

390
00:35:44,748 --> 00:35:46,668
In two days, you have to make it up to me.

391
00:35:47,023 --> 00:35:49,823
Okay. I'll make it up for you in two days.

392
00:35:50,084 --> 00:35:52,204
Let's not talk about it now. I'm going home to pack.

393
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:16,239
How am I supposed to explain it to him?

394
00:36:16,421 --> 00:36:18,301
What should I do now?

395
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,441
Just make it up to him.

396
00:36:27,054 --> 00:36:29,682
You want to tell him that you initially approached him

397
00:36:29,763 --> 00:36:32,158
for revenge on the scumbag who cheated on you

398
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:33,639
and to complete the interview

399
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,840
but accidentally mistook him for that girl's uncle.

400
00:36:36,232 --> 00:36:38,432
It's all meaningless now.

401
00:36:39,675 --> 00:36:42,555
The fact is that he's not happy

402
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,882
about you approaching him not for him.

403
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:52,039
He still can't digest all these facts.

404
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,881
But I have already fallen for him.

405
00:37:00,155 --> 00:37:03,093
I want to be honest with him and apologize.

406
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:05,868
But he won't even listen to me.

407
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,639
He doesn't even want to contact me.

408
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,587
All right.

409
00:37:13,535 --> 00:37:16,202
He is still mad now.

410
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:18,840
Just wait for a while.

411
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,390
Then, find an opportunity to talk to him properly.

412
00:37:21,636 --> 00:37:23,397
Maybe he will forgive you.

413
00:37:23,953 --> 00:37:24,993
Right?

414
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,480
You two are already together.

415
00:37:27,739 --> 00:37:29,539
He likes you too.

416
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,040
It's not as bad as you think.

417
00:37:33,627 --> 00:37:34,977
Really?

418
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,310
Really.

419
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,039
Don't worry.

420
00:38:02,089 --> 00:38:04,079
It's just for these few days.

421
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:06,922
Don't call me. Just send me a message if you have something to say.

422
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:09,602
Okay, we'll go have lunch later.

423
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,519
Awake?

424
00:38:14,607 --> 00:38:15,957
I'm done. You go wash up.

425
00:38:49,534 --> 00:38:51,199
Shan Shan. I'm off to work.

426
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,802
I'm going back to my own home tonight.

427
00:38:54,058 --> 00:38:55,941
Weren't you supposed to stay for a few days?

428
00:38:56,045 --> 00:38:57,724
I'm not staying. I'm not used to the bed.

429
00:39:01,852 --> 00:39:03,732
She hasn't noticed anything, right?

430
00:39:52,316 --> 00:39:54,122
(He is still so young, but already so capable.)

431
00:39:54,679 --> 00:39:56,282
(Yi Yang is extraordinary.)

432
00:39:56,693 --> 00:39:58,963
(Will he stay in the country afterward?)

433
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,322
(Yi Yang is a real genius, isn't he?)

434
00:40:01,621 --> 00:40:03,360
(How did he manage to start a business, )

435
00:40:03,441 --> 00:40:05,545
(do technology R&D, and have so many hobbies?)

436
00:40:05,823 --> 00:40:07,304
(How does he allocate his time?)

437
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,925
(Are there any behind-the-scenes or post-credit scenes?)

438
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,840
Ms. Yi, are you looking for me?

439
00:41:00,158 --> 00:41:01,799
I've already talked to the editor-in-chief.

440
00:41:01,911 --> 00:41:03,800
Your idea can be tried out first.

441
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:06,762
You are in charge of the form and release time.

442
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,232
Thank you, Ms. Yi.

443
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,390
Miss Zheng.

444
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,563
Looks like you're interested in me.

445
00:41:14,644 --> 00:41:15,994
You like to interview me so much.

446
00:41:16,788 --> 00:41:19,429
Mr. Yi, it's because the readers are curious about you.

447
00:41:19,996 --> 00:41:21,599
Okay, I understand.

448
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,948
An additional interview, right?

449
00:41:23,029 --> 00:41:24,379
I'll tell you everything.

450
00:41:26,974 --> 00:41:29,454
I have many friends who have chosen to return home to start a business.

451
00:41:30,149 --> 00:41:31,882
The environment in China is so good now

452
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,881
and everyone wants to make a mark on the stage at home.

453
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,842
During this time of returning home,

454
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,600
I seem to have found my roots

455
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,480
and also a new goal.

456
00:41:47,437 --> 00:41:48,998
I should stay here.

457
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,141
Yeah.

458
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:58,182
The opportunities in China are actually always better than the ones abroad.

459
00:42:00,054 --> 00:42:02,294
You have already answered the last question I wanted to ask.

460
00:42:02,416 --> 00:42:04,725
Our interview has been successfully completed.

461
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:06,919
Have you ever thought of doing

462
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,360
a special report on returnees starting a business?

463
00:42:09,973 --> 00:42:11,323
Returnee entrepreneurship?

464
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:15,042
I had this thought before.

465
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,044
Then, you can make some plans.

466
00:42:17,125 --> 00:42:18,925
If you want to do this special report,

467
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,758
I can introduce you to a few interviewees.

468
00:42:21,894 --> 00:42:22,931
Really?

469
00:42:23,034 --> 00:42:24,384
Thank you.

470
00:42:25,082 --> 00:42:26,135
Oh, right.

471
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,097
I want to add an interactive segment to your interview.

472
00:42:29,233 --> 00:42:30,583
What do you think?

473
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,230
How will we interact?
