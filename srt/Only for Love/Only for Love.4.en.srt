1
00:01:31,202 --> 00:01:36,002
(Only for Love)

2
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:39,002
(Episode 4)

3
00:01:50,395 --> 00:01:51,680
I just heard something.

4
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,620
Xu Yu Ling actually went to interview Fang Shi Yan yesterday.

5
00:01:57,064 --> 00:01:59,094
Wait. Why are you so calm?

6
00:01:59,408 --> 00:02:00,960
I went to the editor's office this morning

7
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:03,114
and saw Xu Yu Ling submitting her draft.

8
00:02:03,195 --> 00:02:04,482
I was thinking

9
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,760
there wasn't any interview task these two days.

10
00:02:06,863 --> 00:02:08,363
Why was she submitting a draft?

11
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:11,236
Then, when I was in the pantry just now,

12
00:02:11,317 --> 00:02:14,430
I heard that she actually went to interview Fang Shi Yan.

13
00:02:14,621 --> 00:02:16,220
Do you know what's even more annoying?

14
00:02:16,353 --> 00:02:18,280
So, I saw your interview outline, right?

15
00:02:18,488 --> 00:02:21,118
She actually copied your outline completely.

16
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:22,979
What do you think of this?

17
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,659
Oh, gosh.

18
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:43,634
Mr. Shi.

19
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:45,789
Did I say something wrong?

20
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,160
I didn't follow the outline and interview him question by question,

21
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,040
but Shi Yan must have known it was the same outline.

22
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,419
And, he answered the same questions twice.

23
00:03:00,755 --> 00:03:03,266
Xu Yu Ling is such a cheat.

24
00:03:04,072 --> 00:03:06,022
Yu Ling, you're so amazing.

25
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,663
You're able to interview Shi Yan.

26
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:09,723
Yeah, Yu Ling, you're awesome.

27
00:03:09,804 --> 00:03:12,242
This is nothing. You two, work hard.

28
00:03:12,786 --> 00:03:14,846
- Did you hear her?   - Loud and clear.

29
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,320
The interview was screwed up and the outline was stolen.

30
00:03:27,438 --> 00:03:29,418
Also, I got pranked while riding a horse.

31
00:03:29,853 --> 00:03:30,858
Oh my.

32
00:03:30,939 --> 00:03:33,870
How many blunders did I make in front of him?

33
00:03:34,498 --> 00:03:37,162
Actually, this Shi Yan is quite nice.

34
00:03:37,747 --> 00:03:40,268
He's a busy man, but he still accepted two interviews.

35
00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:42,178
He seems quite patient to you.

36
00:03:45,653 --> 00:03:47,465
Well. He's not a good man.

37
00:03:47,567 --> 00:03:48,888
He holds grudges.

38
00:03:48,968 --> 00:03:50,322
His mood changes quickly.

39
00:03:50,417 --> 00:03:51,966
He also likes to see people make mistakes.

40
00:03:52,104 --> 00:03:53,604
But, he's not a bad person either.

41
00:03:53,685 --> 00:03:55,106
He doesn't seem to have ill intentions.

42
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:57,682
But, when interviewed, you can't tell what he's up to.

43
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:00,444
He's a great actor.

44
00:04:00,578 --> 00:04:02,448
I can't really understand this man.

45
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:20,882
Mr. Shi. Marketing and Finance departments

46
00:04:20,964 --> 00:04:22,587
just released the evaluation report of Le'an.

47
00:04:22,668 --> 00:04:25,162
From what we can see now, there's still room for negotiation.

48
00:04:25,282 --> 00:04:27,151
But, are you really considering to...

49
00:04:30,954 --> 00:04:32,233
Besides,

50
00:04:32,368 --> 00:04:35,078
where did they get such a large sum of money out of a sudden?

51
00:04:37,376 --> 00:04:38,966
There will always be someone

52
00:04:39,087 --> 00:04:40,548
willing to do something profitable.

53
00:04:47,097 --> 00:04:48,682
Shu Yi. Long time no see.

54
00:04:48,851 --> 00:04:50,520
Where are you going? I'll give you a ride.

55
00:04:51,887 --> 00:04:53,437
Thanks, no need.

56
00:04:54,688 --> 00:04:56,088
I'm the only one in the car.

57
00:04:56,168 --> 00:04:57,754
This car was bought for me by Le Zhi.

58
00:04:57,857 --> 00:04:59,718
I'm going to work at Mingyu in two days.

59
00:05:00,785 --> 00:05:03,522
If you like driving so much, why don't you become a driver?

60
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,816
Who is this?

61
00:05:09,912 --> 00:05:10,953
He has such a nice car.

62
00:05:11,034 --> 00:05:14,042
Why did he only gift you a Mercedes worth 300,000?

63
00:05:14,551 --> 00:05:16,802
And, you still have to wait a few days before you can go to work?

64
00:05:16,921 --> 00:05:19,322
For something that Uncle can accomplish with one sentence,

65
00:05:19,447 --> 00:05:21,968
why do you have to go through so many interviews before you can get in?

66
00:05:22,048 --> 00:05:24,219
I think you should hurry up and work diligently as a driver.

67
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,009
Don't stay here and be a nuisance.

68
00:05:33,081 --> 00:05:34,241
Shan Shan!

69
00:05:34,321 --> 00:05:36,721
You are really eloquent when you scold people.

70
00:05:36,817 --> 00:05:38,526
That's so relieving.

71
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,768
With his kind of mentality,

72
00:05:41,848 --> 00:05:43,927
he's still fantasizing about riding on a car having

73
00:05:44,007 --> 00:05:45,168
a license plate with repeated digits.

74
00:05:45,248 --> 00:05:48,598
He underestimates Shi Yan too much, and he overestimates himself too much.

75
00:05:50,055 --> 00:05:51,316
(Let her come.)

76
00:05:51,832 --> 00:05:54,382
(Miss Zheng might want to ride on this car more.)

77
00:05:57,089 --> 00:05:58,348
What are you thinking?

78
00:06:00,647 --> 00:06:03,687
Some people can easily get their car replaced,

79
00:06:03,767 --> 00:06:05,007
but I'm working so hard

80
00:06:05,087 --> 00:06:06,327
just to get my outline stolen

81
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:07,827
and my interview screwed up.

82
00:06:09,808 --> 00:06:11,648
Stop saying depressing things.

83
00:06:11,728 --> 00:06:15,229
With your face that could topple a kingdom and ruin a nation,

84
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,951
even I, as a woman, can't resist it.

85
00:06:17,048 --> 00:06:18,718
Is there any man that can resist you?

86
00:06:19,328 --> 00:06:21,482
Even if I have a face that could "topple a kingdom and ruin a nation,"

87
00:06:21,696 --> 00:06:22,898
I still got pranked

88
00:06:23,048 --> 00:06:24,877
and was left alone in the car.

89
00:06:25,683 --> 00:06:28,202
I already helped you make an appointment with Situ Yi.

90
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,240
Do you know how hard it is to make an appointment with her now?

91
00:06:31,407 --> 00:06:33,922
Fortunately, we had some connections when we were in school.

92
00:06:34,003 --> 00:06:35,282
We shared our experiences in love,

93
00:06:35,376 --> 00:06:37,257
and I even lent her clothes for a date.

94
00:06:37,338 --> 00:06:38,847
We have some kind of connection.

95
00:06:39,007 --> 00:06:40,997
Otherwise, you won't be able to meet her.

96
00:06:42,673 --> 00:06:44,994
Shan Shan, thank you.

97
00:06:45,121 --> 00:06:47,526
And, that's why I've repaid you with this delicate meal, alright?

98
00:06:51,921 --> 00:06:53,591
To be honest, baby,

99
00:06:54,128 --> 00:06:56,907
even I, as a woman, can't resist you with that expression.

100
00:06:56,988 --> 00:06:59,962
So, why did Shi Yan treat you like that?

101
00:07:00,313 --> 00:07:01,832
Or, should I say,

102
00:07:01,967 --> 00:07:03,891
men all like to play hard to get?

103
00:07:03,972 --> 00:07:06,231
So, they talk like they don't like you, and act like a gentleman.

104
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,432
What's important now is not the man's strategy,

105
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:12,183
but to take back the headline coverage that rightfully belongs to me.

106
00:07:13,265 --> 00:07:17,164
You have been so persistent about headline coverages this year.

107
00:07:17,488 --> 00:07:19,950
I don't want to compete for the headline coverage. I just want to...

108
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,721
"Prove that I have the ability to be promoted

109
00:07:21,825 --> 00:07:23,654
to write for the digital magazine."

110
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:26,288
You want to write for a digital magazine with fresh perspectives

111
00:07:26,391 --> 00:07:28,856
that speaks for the ordinary financial audience,

112
00:07:28,937 --> 00:07:31,522
which is different from the paper magazine, right?

113
00:07:31,967 --> 00:07:34,638
I've heard it so many times that I can now recite it word for word.

114
00:07:35,528 --> 00:07:37,169
But, from an outsider's perspective,

115
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,183
aren't you still competing for the headline coverage?

116
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:40,400
Actually,

117
00:07:40,481 --> 00:07:42,711
isn't being a deputy editor great?

118
00:07:43,345 --> 00:07:44,986
Maybe being a deputy editor is great,

119
00:07:45,067 --> 00:07:46,936
but it's not really my goal.

120
00:07:47,087 --> 00:07:49,168
Embracing change and writing for the digital magazine

121
00:07:49,248 --> 00:07:51,078
is my professional ideal.

122
00:07:51,168 --> 00:07:52,255
You see,

123
00:07:52,368 --> 00:07:53,882
when I was interviewing Shi Yan,

124
00:07:54,072 --> 00:07:56,642
he changed the interview time on the spot and we were caught off guard.

125
00:07:56,723 --> 00:07:58,442
But, writing for digital magazines won't be like this.

126
00:07:58,546 --> 00:07:59,882
We can maintain the timeliness of the news,

127
00:07:59,963 --> 00:08:01,722
and there are various ways of publication.

128
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:03,408
Just send a link, and we can share it.

129
00:08:03,488 --> 00:08:05,848
This has already become the new reading habit of people nowadays.

130
00:08:05,928 --> 00:08:07,367
And, there are also a variety of formats

131
00:08:07,447 --> 00:08:08,907
we can choose to present to the readers.

132
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:10,958
So, I won't give up.

133
00:08:11,647 --> 00:08:14,127
I have already planned a special coverage

134
00:08:14,207 --> 00:08:15,608
to put on the digital magazine.

135
00:08:15,688 --> 00:08:16,810
If it can be realized,

136
00:08:16,891 --> 00:08:19,430
then I will be one step closer to my goal.

137
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,809
Mr. Shi, I'm sorry.

138
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:25,054
It's almost time to get off work, and I'm sorry to bother you.

139
00:08:25,407 --> 00:08:26,548
It's okay.

140
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,348
Let's have a drink of water first.

141
00:08:28,465 --> 00:08:30,094
Did anything urgent happen?

142
00:08:31,647 --> 00:08:33,888
After we talked last time,

143
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:35,930
I've been thinking about what you said

144
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:38,002
and discussed it with the team.

145
00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:40,918
We don't want to miss such a great visionary like you.

146
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:43,322
So, I came this time

147
00:08:43,568 --> 00:08:48,038
to talk to you again about the investment amount.

148
00:08:48,608 --> 00:08:49,708
Sure.

149
00:08:50,647 --> 00:08:53,468
I'm very pleased that you came to find me at this time.

150
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:56,237
But, Mr. Chen, please give me some time.

151
00:08:58,224 --> 00:08:59,645
I understand that.

152
00:09:00,048 --> 00:09:02,599
Re-negotiating will definitely take some time.

153
00:09:03,177 --> 00:09:04,217
But,

154
00:09:04,298 --> 00:09:06,847
I do have some pressure on my side.

155
00:09:09,767 --> 00:09:12,008
I'm glad you're reconsidering my proposal.

156
00:09:12,088 --> 00:09:13,718
I'll give you an answer as soon as possible.

157
00:09:14,807 --> 00:09:15,988
Noted.

158
00:09:20,287 --> 00:09:21,762
If it's as you said,

159
00:09:21,848 --> 00:09:24,768
and you and Xu Yu Ling were using the exact same outline,

160
00:09:24,887 --> 00:09:26,838
it's really hard to tell who wins or loses,

161
00:09:27,007 --> 00:09:30,122
unless you have a way to get new content.

162
00:09:30,585 --> 00:09:31,845
You're right.

163
00:09:32,407 --> 00:09:36,162
But, I have to be able to meet him for the new content.

164
00:09:37,568 --> 00:09:39,068
Look for an opportunity.

165
00:09:39,469 --> 00:09:41,544
You two were riding horses together yesterday.

166
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,735
That counts as a bit of a private connection, right?

167
00:09:44,475 --> 00:09:45,882
I don't even have his WeChat,

168
00:09:45,963 --> 00:09:47,442
so how can you say we have any private connection?

169
00:09:47,523 --> 00:09:50,038
Besides, he's so weird.

170
00:09:50,568 --> 00:09:52,767
Is it the point whether he's weird or not?

171
00:09:52,848 --> 00:09:54,969
You have to be clear on your goal. Zheng Shu Yi.

172
00:09:55,088 --> 00:09:57,447
You are not just fighting for the headline coverage anymore.

173
00:09:57,527 --> 00:09:58,727
You are doing it so that, one day,

174
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,482
you can crush that jerk

175
00:10:00,624 --> 00:10:02,562
and that woman who stole your interview.

176
00:10:02,646 --> 00:10:04,161
You are also fighting for your long-cherished promotion

177
00:10:04,241 --> 00:10:06,042
to write for a digital magazine.

178
00:10:15,768 --> 00:10:19,067
The stuff has been sent to you by an urgent order. Remember to check it.

179
00:10:20,128 --> 00:10:22,628
- Who is it?   - A boring person.

180
00:10:24,674 --> 00:10:27,144
And yet, another man has fallen at your feet.

181
00:10:28,386 --> 00:10:29,922
So many people are chasing you.

182
00:10:29,998 --> 00:10:32,218
Don't you have one that you like?

183
00:10:33,561 --> 00:10:35,430
You don't understand.

184
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,439
My principle is

185
00:10:37,808 --> 00:10:40,167
to no rejection, no explanation,

186
00:10:40,287 --> 00:10:41,547
and no asking others to stay.

187
00:10:41,687 --> 00:10:44,838
Besides, he really wants to get me with such basic tactics?

188
00:10:45,057 --> 00:10:46,647
That's underestimating me, right?

189
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:48,348
What tactics?

190
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:50,447
Using the excuse of helping me fix something

191
00:10:50,527 --> 00:10:52,242
and deliberately leaving something at my house,

192
00:10:52,394 --> 00:10:54,464
creating an opportunity to meet like this.

193
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,762
Such a low-level trick, and people still do this nowadays.

194
00:10:57,922 --> 00:10:59,404
Speaking of which,

195
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,602
I also have something left at Shi Yan's place.

196
00:11:03,042 --> 00:11:04,592
Why didn't you say it earlier?

197
00:11:05,066 --> 00:11:07,457
What a great opportunity to meet.

198
00:11:26,807 --> 00:11:27,907
Hello.

199
00:11:31,887 --> 00:11:33,027
Mr. Shi.

200
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:36,397
Miss Zheng Shu Yi from Financial Introduce is looking for you.

201
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:42,787
Hello?

202
00:11:44,472 --> 00:11:45,893
Hello, Mr. Shi.

203
00:11:46,151 --> 00:11:48,419
I think I dropped an earring in your car.

204
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,010
Did you see it?

205
00:11:52,448 --> 00:11:53,708
No, I didn't.

206
00:11:58,368 --> 00:12:00,687
This earring is really important to me.

207
00:12:00,818 --> 00:12:02,757
Could you please take another look?

208
00:12:04,088 --> 00:12:05,468
How important is it?

209
00:12:07,222 --> 00:12:09,802
It's more important than my life.

210
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,042
It's important because

211
00:12:13,007 --> 00:12:15,207
it was left to my mom by my grandmother,

212
00:12:15,295 --> 00:12:16,926
and my mom left it to me.

213
00:12:17,061 --> 00:12:18,682
(It's a family heirloom)

214
00:12:20,848 --> 00:12:22,357
and my dowry.

215
00:12:22,728 --> 00:12:25,598
I plan to wear it at my wedding in the future.

216
00:12:25,767 --> 00:12:27,607
(When I see it, I think of my grandmother.)

217
00:12:27,687 --> 00:12:29,962
(I haven't seen her for a long time.)

218
00:12:30,359 --> 00:12:32,162
My grandmother covered it using a scarf with six layers,

219
00:12:32,243 --> 00:12:33,643
and had kept it for many years.

220
00:12:33,739 --> 00:12:35,879
Usually, I didn't take it out to wear.

221
00:12:36,568 --> 00:12:39,202
So, why are you willing to wear it this time?

222
00:12:43,287 --> 00:12:44,642
It's because...

223
00:12:44,752 --> 00:12:46,833
It's because it's such a precious heirloom.

224
00:12:46,914 --> 00:12:50,183
So, it's worthy of the important moment when I interviewed you.

225
00:12:53,976 --> 00:12:55,076
I saw it.

226
00:12:55,433 --> 00:12:58,104
Your dowry is made of plastic.

227
00:13:03,647 --> 00:13:04,828
About that...

228
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:08,471
My ancestors were poor and life was very difficult.

229
00:13:08,552 --> 00:13:09,566
(They were farmers.)

230
00:13:09,647 --> 00:13:11,107
(They hadn't seen much of the world.)

231
00:13:11,287 --> 00:13:12,768
Although it was made of plastic,

232
00:13:12,848 --> 00:13:15,598
it was the most precious thing in our family at the time.

233
00:13:21,047 --> 00:13:22,678
Send it to her.

234
00:13:25,368 --> 00:13:27,838
Miss Zheng, when do you need it?

235
00:13:27,968 --> 00:13:30,567
As soon as possible. I can't sleep without seeing it.

236
00:13:30,647 --> 00:13:32,327
(Okay, I'll send it to you.)

237
00:13:32,407 --> 00:13:33,507
No.

238
00:13:34,721 --> 00:13:35,962
I don't want to trouble you.

239
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,679
I'll go and get it myself.

240
00:13:42,128 --> 00:13:43,228
Okay.

241
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,031
Shu Yi, what were you thinking?

242
00:14:02,192 --> 00:14:05,542
You met Shi Yan with a pair of plastic earrings?

243
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,610
What's wrong with plastic?

244
00:14:07,705 --> 00:14:10,026
Plastic is one of the greatest inventions of mankind.

245
00:14:10,122 --> 00:14:11,721
Plastic has improved human life.

246
00:14:11,887 --> 00:14:13,397
Why look down on plastic?

247
00:14:14,336 --> 00:14:16,085
What are you talking about?

248
00:14:16,646 --> 00:14:17,808
You've embarrassed yourself like this,

249
00:14:17,887 --> 00:14:19,327
and Shi Yan didn't even hang up your phone.

250
00:14:19,438 --> 00:14:21,188
He even wanted to send it to you.

251
00:14:21,425 --> 00:14:23,175
He's surely interested in you.

252
00:14:32,057 --> 00:14:33,722
Bogang Yunwan?

253
00:14:38,727 --> 00:14:40,806
For a residential area with this kind of price,

254
00:14:40,887 --> 00:14:43,637
it's a given that it's Shi Yan's residential address.

255
00:14:43,968 --> 00:14:46,522
Is he being so direct?

256
00:14:46,807 --> 00:14:48,528
This is called not having feelings for you?

257
00:14:48,608 --> 00:14:50,368
How could he...

258
00:14:50,597 --> 00:14:51,617
He...

259
00:14:51,728 --> 00:14:53,567
(Just left me in the lobby alone and left.)

260
00:14:53,655 --> 00:14:55,525
(He didn't even want to eat with me.)

261
00:14:57,336 --> 00:15:00,242
You threw out a bait,

262
00:15:00,527 --> 00:15:02,482
and he sent you the address right away.

263
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:04,830
Is he so impatient?

264
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,481
He's not usually an impatient person.

265
00:15:07,608 --> 00:15:09,477
That only means one thing.

266
00:15:10,007 --> 00:15:11,427
Men are all the same.

267
00:15:11,728 --> 00:15:14,318
I'm telling you, in this kind of situation, you shouldn't go.

268
00:15:17,232 --> 00:15:18,562
What are you doing?

269
00:15:21,248 --> 00:15:22,918
Just take the home run, alright?

270
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,207
I understand.

271
00:15:24,287 --> 00:15:25,667
But, not this time.

272
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:27,990
I have a plan that I want to discuss with Shi Yan.

273
00:15:28,472 --> 00:15:29,812
What plan?

274
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,374
Uncle,

275
00:15:51,488 --> 00:15:52,729
why did you come back?

276
00:15:52,817 --> 00:15:54,807
Weren't you supposed to meet Guan Ji?

277
00:15:55,328 --> 00:15:57,277
Didn't you say not to call him Guan Ji?

278
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,110
Guan Ji said to call him Guan Ji.

279
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:04,927
You haven't told me why you suddenly came back in the evening.

280
00:16:06,577 --> 00:16:08,176
This is my home.

281
00:16:08,287 --> 00:16:11,318
If you don't want to see me, go back and stay with your grandfather.

282
00:16:17,368 --> 00:16:19,802
I'll tidy up my spoils.

283
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,482
Stay in your room. Don't come out unless I tell you so.

284
00:16:27,439 --> 00:16:31,833
(Bogang Yunwan)

285
00:16:38,075 --> 00:16:39,125
Thank you.

286
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,306
You're welcome.

287
00:17:51,484 --> 00:17:53,993
Mr. Shi, I'm here to get something.

288
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:13,019
Mr. Shi. You like Song Le Lan too?

289
00:18:16,877 --> 00:18:18,311
What a coincidence.

290
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,322
I like her very much too. I have all her albums.

291
00:18:21,554 --> 00:18:23,264
Which song of hers do you like the most?

292
00:18:31,317 --> 00:18:32,872
(Why did you suddenly cancel the appointment?)

293
00:18:32,954 --> 00:18:34,194
(Chen Sheng said you were working, )

294
00:18:34,328 --> 00:18:35,768
(but Yue said you were at home.)

295
00:18:35,926 --> 00:18:38,636
(So, it must not be for work.)

296
00:18:38,768 --> 00:18:42,602
Come on. You're not dating someone, right?

297
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:46,130
(You haven't been in a relationship for three years, right?)

298
00:18:46,768 --> 00:18:49,157
I'm too busy to talk to you.

299
00:18:49,431 --> 00:18:51,568
(The more you say that, the more I feel like it's not about work.)

300
00:18:51,647 --> 00:18:53,707
It's not convenient now. We'll talk later.

301
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:55,842
Come on. Let's drink.

302
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:57,048
Hey!

303
00:18:57,128 --> 00:18:58,528
How dare you skip me?

304
00:18:58,608 --> 00:19:00,278
No, I didn't. Cheers!

305
00:19:00,647 --> 00:19:02,157
That's too weird.

306
00:19:03,032 --> 00:19:04,362
Is he in a relationship?

307
00:19:14,808 --> 00:19:15,828
Guan Ji.

308
00:19:16,528 --> 00:19:18,318
Let's drink. What are you thinking?

309
00:19:18,447 --> 00:19:20,478
Are you thinking about some woman?

310
00:19:21,768 --> 00:19:24,157
I'm leaving first. Have fun.

311
00:19:25,167 --> 00:19:27,048
- Why are you in such a hurry to go?   - Guan Ji.

312
00:19:27,608 --> 00:19:29,397
Why is he so unusual today?

313
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:30,607
What's going on?

314
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,747
Let's take a look.

315
00:19:32,247 --> 00:19:33,628
Is there anything else?

316
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:39,528
What have you been working on lately?

317
00:19:39,608 --> 00:19:41,877
Is it something to do with Le'an Technology?

318
00:19:43,607 --> 00:19:46,518
Are you encountering issues with regard to this matter?

319
00:19:46,647 --> 00:19:48,740
My colleague is writing a draft for Lieying.

320
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:51,187
I'm also doing a synced interview with Mr. Chen from Le'an.

321
00:19:51,392 --> 00:19:52,752
If I'm guessing right,

322
00:19:52,832 --> 00:19:56,512
there may be different opinions within Yunchuang

323
00:19:56,593 --> 00:19:58,303
toward Lieying and Le'an.

324
00:20:01,848 --> 00:20:04,402
Lieying has been emphasizing both openly and secretly in the interviews

325
00:20:04,528 --> 00:20:06,024
that Yunchuang will invest in them,

326
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:08,397
and Le'an has expressed similar ideas.

327
00:20:08,528 --> 00:20:10,567
But, you said in the last interview that you value more

328
00:20:10,647 --> 00:20:12,362
the innovation of technology

329
00:20:12,459 --> 00:20:14,419
and the autonomy of core technology,

330
00:20:14,553 --> 00:20:16,983
so you are more inclined toward Le'an Technology.

331
00:20:17,089 --> 00:20:19,449
But, there may be different voices within Yunchuang.

332
00:20:19,568 --> 00:20:21,288
If the Guan Capital is to enter,

333
00:20:21,415 --> 00:20:23,528
then their opinion is also very important.

334
00:20:23,608 --> 00:20:26,598
So, that's why you are very busy recently.

335
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:31,348
So?

336
00:20:32,033 --> 00:20:34,783
It just so happens I'm doing a personal interview with Chen Kang.

337
00:20:35,128 --> 00:20:38,282
So, I want to use your interview as an opportunity

338
00:20:38,384 --> 00:20:40,082
to do an exclusive series of interviews

339
00:20:40,165 --> 00:20:42,242
before you finish these things.

340
00:20:42,323 --> 00:20:43,803
I'd like to invite several related parties,

341
00:20:43,884 --> 00:20:47,362
like Yunchuang, Le'an, and Guan Capital, in a discussion.

342
00:21:06,245 --> 00:21:07,544
What'd you like to drink?

343
00:21:08,155 --> 00:21:10,122
Lemonade, thanks.

344
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,322
Do you want it with ice?

345
00:21:48,487 --> 00:21:49,962
Oh gosh, you're so handsome.

346
00:21:50,189 --> 00:21:51,562
What?

347
00:21:55,611 --> 00:21:56,712
Yes.

348
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:10,929
If you are right,

349
00:22:11,048 --> 00:22:13,238
why do you think I will definitely succeed?

350
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:14,953
If I do as you say,

351
00:22:15,088 --> 00:22:16,677
how many headline coverages can you get?

352
00:22:29,687 --> 00:22:31,442
(There's a woman here.)

353
00:22:32,089 --> 00:22:33,469
(Girlfriend?)

354
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:36,813
(Does Shi Yan have a girlfriend?)

355
00:22:41,817 --> 00:22:42,917
Mr. Shi,

356
00:22:43,133 --> 00:22:46,861
am I disturbing you and your girlfriend?

357
00:22:48,528 --> 00:22:51,758
Please consider my proposal carefully.

358
00:22:52,407 --> 00:22:53,917
Girlfriend?

359
00:22:55,081 --> 00:22:56,241
The one in the room,

360
00:22:56,336 --> 00:22:57,535
isn't she your girlfriend?

361
00:22:57,647 --> 00:22:58,828
No.

362
00:23:00,008 --> 00:23:01,147
That's good.

363
00:23:02,487 --> 00:23:03,628
Good?

364
00:23:03,768 --> 00:23:05,028
How so?

365
00:23:06,608 --> 00:23:07,628
Just...

366
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,070
We could avoid unnecessary misunderstandings.

367
00:23:11,088 --> 00:23:12,208
Misunderstandings?

368
00:23:12,288 --> 00:23:13,467
For example?

369
00:23:15,407 --> 00:23:18,117
So, are you saying my niece won't misunderstand?

370
00:23:19,768 --> 00:23:21,122
Niece?

371
00:23:22,655 --> 00:23:25,045
Niece? Which means...

372
00:23:26,665 --> 00:23:29,025
That would be even worse for your niece to misunderstand.

373
00:23:29,144 --> 00:23:31,122
I'll go first. Rest early.

374
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:38,008
Who's here?

375
00:23:38,088 --> 00:23:40,598
I seem to have heard a woman's voice.

376
00:23:50,927 --> 00:23:52,048
That was close.

377
00:23:52,128 --> 00:23:54,998
I almost got into a fight with his niece.

378
00:23:55,528 --> 00:23:57,798
If I had met her just now, the Yunchuang special report

379
00:23:57,879 --> 00:24:00,909
and promotion to write for the digital magazine must be coming to an end.

380
00:24:09,576 --> 00:24:11,402
(She came here without taking this back.)

381
00:24:11,584 --> 00:24:13,413
(What an interesting trick.)

382
00:24:16,096 --> 00:24:18,435
Uncle, what are you looking at?

383
00:24:18,768 --> 00:24:20,317
Who let you come out?

384
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:24,677
Who was that person just now?

385
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,140
Your girlfriend?

386
00:24:33,376 --> 00:24:36,287
Uncle, I've thought it through.

387
00:24:36,447 --> 00:24:39,558
What if I don't go to work for now?

388
00:24:39,647 --> 00:24:41,558
Can I go abroad for study?

389
00:24:42,927 --> 00:24:46,117
Study abroad? Are you really worthy of these two words?

390
00:24:50,084 --> 00:24:51,239
Actually,

391
00:24:51,743 --> 00:24:53,490
why do people have to do something that has no meaning

392
00:24:53,571 --> 00:24:54,962
and is bound to fail?

393
00:24:55,043 --> 00:24:57,968
Our whole family are elites who work hard to make money.

394
00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:02,322
But, no one has time to spend and enjoy life.

395
00:25:02,727 --> 00:25:05,522
So, why can't it be me?

396
00:25:05,977 --> 00:25:08,482
If someone has to spend money,

397
00:25:09,102 --> 00:25:10,362
I can do it.

398
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:15,407
In high school, you've never passed Chemistry.

399
00:25:15,517 --> 00:25:17,208
But, you know more about cosmetics ingredients

400
00:25:17,288 --> 00:25:19,008
than the Chemistry teacher.

401
00:25:19,088 --> 00:25:22,087
You were sent abroad for college, and your English wasn't good,

402
00:25:22,167 --> 00:25:24,728
but that doesn't stop you from booking ticket after ticket

403
00:25:24,808 --> 00:25:26,127
and traveling around the world.

404
00:25:26,207 --> 00:25:27,728
So, it's not that things are bound to fail.

405
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:30,238
It's up to whether you want to succeed.

406
00:25:32,154 --> 00:25:35,104
I know I did something wrong.

407
00:25:36,175 --> 00:25:38,712
But, Uncle, whatever it is that you want me to do,

408
00:25:38,793 --> 00:25:40,682
you can't let me go to work.

409
00:25:40,768 --> 00:25:43,248
I didn't even get up early and stay up late for the college entrance exam.

410
00:25:43,328 --> 00:25:46,788
Do I have to work nine to five for a few thousand salary now?

411
00:25:50,447 --> 00:25:52,407
It's almost the end of the year.

412
00:25:52,487 --> 00:25:54,278
Let's talk about it after the new year.

413
00:25:55,222 --> 00:25:56,701
Is that okay?

414
00:25:56,782 --> 00:25:58,008
Please, Uncle.

415
00:25:58,088 --> 00:25:59,427
Qin Shi Yue.

416
00:26:01,447 --> 00:26:03,238
The Qin family doesn't keep useless people.

417
00:26:10,182 --> 00:26:11,647
Wow.

418
00:26:11,728 --> 00:26:17,025
You truly have the potential to become a master without a teacher.

419
00:26:17,144 --> 00:26:19,828
You went there and didn't take the earring back

420
00:26:20,008 --> 00:26:21,488
in order to meet him again.

421
00:26:21,576 --> 00:26:23,402
You created an opportunity.

422
00:26:23,831 --> 00:26:24,930
Brilliant.

423
00:26:25,528 --> 00:26:27,448
So, you should quickly give him a call

424
00:26:27,528 --> 00:26:29,397
to arrange the time to go to his house again.

425
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:30,868
Hurry up.

426
00:26:32,288 --> 00:26:34,747
Let's talk later. I still have something to do here.

427
00:26:42,808 --> 00:26:44,327
Brilliant my foot.

428
00:26:44,407 --> 00:26:46,478
I didn't leave it there on purpose.

429
00:26:46,967 --> 00:26:48,768
And, I don't even have his number.

430
00:26:48,848 --> 00:26:50,558
How should I call him?

431
00:26:51,447 --> 00:26:54,348
I don't know if the special report will fly either.

432
00:26:56,065 --> 00:26:57,425
Oh no.

433
00:26:57,528 --> 00:26:59,677
What should I do?

434
00:26:59,855 --> 00:27:02,322
What should I do?

435
00:27:03,368 --> 00:27:05,838
They all say it's hard for you to be dated alone.

436
00:27:07,048 --> 00:27:08,798
I didn't expect you to be here.

437
00:27:10,472 --> 00:27:12,102
Whether to go out or not depends on

438
00:27:12,247 --> 00:27:13,998
who the other person is.

439
00:27:14,808 --> 00:27:16,108
It's late.

440
00:27:16,528 --> 00:27:18,238
There's nothing to see here anymore.

441
00:27:19,328 --> 00:27:21,868
So, why not we go somewhere else?

442
00:27:29,993 --> 00:27:31,372
(The night is beautiful tonight.)

443
00:27:31,536 --> 00:27:32,996
(There is also good scenery elsewhere.)

444
00:27:35,458 --> 00:27:38,758
Or, should we go get something to drink first?

445
00:27:39,713 --> 00:27:41,703
Or, do you want to...

446
00:27:43,034 --> 00:27:44,863
It's time to go somewhere else indeed.

447
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,279
I do want to go to another place.

448
00:27:48,753 --> 00:27:50,973
But, not with you.

449
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:52,406
I'm leaving.

450
00:27:52,487 --> 00:27:53,667
Bye.

451
00:28:21,174 --> 00:28:22,394
(Mr. Shi.)

452
00:28:22,528 --> 00:28:24,847
(I think I dropped an earring in your car.)

453
00:28:24,927 --> 00:28:26,387
(Did you see it?)

454
00:28:27,128 --> 00:28:28,268
(No, I didn't.)

455
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:30,847
(This earring is really important to me.)

456
00:28:30,927 --> 00:28:32,917
(Can you please take another look?)

457
00:28:33,727 --> 00:28:35,108
(How important is it?)

458
00:29:05,848 --> 00:29:07,928
Xu Yu Ling was called to the editor's office.

459
00:29:08,008 --> 00:29:09,877
They wouldn't really use her draft, right?

460
00:29:11,802 --> 00:29:13,366
I've done everything I should do.

461
00:29:13,447 --> 00:29:15,278
Maybe I've done things I shouldn't have done too.

462
00:29:15,494 --> 00:29:17,326
I'm still confident in my draft.

463
00:29:17,407 --> 00:29:18,802
Since I've done all I can,

464
00:29:18,885 --> 00:29:20,395
I'll just leave it to fate.

465
00:29:23,997 --> 00:29:25,178
Where are you going?

466
00:29:26,008 --> 00:29:28,127
I'm going to wash my face to wake myself up,

467
00:29:28,207 --> 00:29:30,242
and I'll come back to continue exploring the value of some news.

468
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,805
Anyway, my career still has to go on.

469
00:29:43,967 --> 00:29:45,887
Don't mention it.

470
00:29:45,967 --> 00:29:47,998
That Shi Yan really...

471
00:29:48,088 --> 00:29:49,327
I was so unlucky.

472
00:29:49,407 --> 00:29:51,402
Shi Yan didn't say anything useful at all.

473
00:29:51,514 --> 00:29:53,591
It's just some general talk.

474
00:29:53,877 --> 00:29:55,436
If he didn't want to be interviewed, he should just say it.

475
00:29:55,517 --> 00:29:56,768
Why is he doing that to me?

476
00:29:56,848 --> 00:29:58,637
He's such a jerk.

477
00:29:59,307 --> 00:30:01,162
(Just some general talk?)

478
00:30:01,322 --> 00:30:03,042
(He gave me a lot of information.)

479
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:05,162
Who knows how she dealt with Shi Yan?

480
00:30:05,368 --> 00:30:08,288
You know that her look is really nice, right?

481
00:30:08,368 --> 00:30:09,865
Plus, she'll do whatever to achieve her goal.

482
00:30:09,946 --> 00:30:11,082
I've interviewed Shi Yan,

483
00:30:11,152 --> 00:30:14,722
and she even managed to interview Tang Yi. Using her draft? She...

484
00:30:17,608 --> 00:30:18,768
Fortunately, it's not broken.

485
00:30:18,848 --> 00:30:19,987
Thank you.

486
00:30:23,568 --> 00:30:25,197
Thank you for the compliment, Yu Ling.

487
00:30:39,008 --> 00:30:40,362
Enough already.

488
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:43,980
Xu Yu Ling did something really unfair this time.

489
00:30:44,127 --> 00:30:45,533
I already warned her just now.

490
00:30:45,614 --> 00:30:46,955
I'll put it down on her record.

491
00:30:47,727 --> 00:30:50,488
She will be duly assessed during the performance and year-end evaluation.

492
00:30:50,568 --> 00:30:51,628
In the future,

493
00:30:51,727 --> 00:30:53,598
I'll prevent this kind of situation.

494
00:30:54,328 --> 00:30:56,455
Stealing other people's drafts is not allowed.

495
00:30:56,546 --> 00:30:58,296
Is a warning enough?

496
00:30:58,528 --> 00:31:00,117
What do you mean?

497
00:31:00,927 --> 00:31:02,427
Do you want me to fire her?

498
00:31:05,528 --> 00:31:06,922
It's just that she was forced into a corner.

499
00:31:07,082 --> 00:31:08,631
Our brand hasn't been launched yet.

500
00:31:08,824 --> 00:31:10,830
Our circle of financial news is so small.

501
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:12,311
No matter if the company fired her

502
00:31:12,392 --> 00:31:13,902
or she quit on her own,

503
00:31:14,048 --> 00:31:15,928
other people will definitely inquire about the reason.

504
00:31:16,008 --> 00:31:18,798
Her career will also be affected.

505
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,981
Why aren't you saying anything?

506
00:31:24,706 --> 00:31:27,225
I can understand her stealing my interview,

507
00:31:27,406 --> 00:31:29,353
but why did she have to steal my outline?

508
00:31:29,434 --> 00:31:31,402
Doesn't this prove that your outline is better than hers?

509
00:31:31,542 --> 00:31:33,362
She has proven with her actions

510
00:31:33,489 --> 00:31:35,239
that you are better than her.

511
00:31:36,033 --> 00:31:38,533
This time, you have won decisively.

512
00:31:38,697 --> 00:31:40,016
For a journalist,

513
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:43,518
the biggest punishment is to be crushed by other's journalistic ability.

514
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:44,798
I think, this time,

515
00:31:44,887 --> 00:31:46,917
she has truly learned her lesson.

516
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:50,628
Shu Yi.

517
00:31:50,935 --> 00:31:54,117
You still have a long way to go in this industry.

518
00:31:54,487 --> 00:31:57,797
Be merciful whenever you can.

519
00:32:00,431 --> 00:32:05,822
So, it's Shi Yan who chose my interview outline, right?

520
00:32:06,647 --> 00:32:07,707
Yes.

521
00:32:08,112 --> 00:32:09,631
Shi Yan is quite principled.

522
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:12,167
This time, neither did he make a fool of Financial Introduce,

523
00:32:12,247 --> 00:32:13,978
nor did he reject Xu Yu Ling's interview.

524
00:32:14,073 --> 00:32:15,862
He also gave you enough information.

525
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,070
In the end, no one lost.

526
00:32:18,407 --> 00:32:20,518
Look at his EQ and learn from him.

527
00:32:20,967 --> 00:32:23,431
Also, one more thing. I think you understand it too.

528
00:32:23,512 --> 00:32:25,111
Whether it's Yunchuang or Shi Yan,

529
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,231
they chose Financial Introduce first

530
00:32:27,377 --> 00:32:30,667
and then chose one of you two.

531
00:32:31,288 --> 00:32:33,762
Ms. Yi, I understand.

532
00:32:33,907 --> 00:32:37,167
All my achievements are based on our magazine platform,

533
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:39,768
which is one of the best in the industry.

534
00:32:39,848 --> 00:32:41,928
So, I want to write better for every article

535
00:32:42,008 --> 00:32:44,078
to defend the honor of Finance Introduce.

536
00:32:44,608 --> 00:32:46,642
You are so beautiful and smart,

537
00:32:46,808 --> 00:32:49,478
so don't waste your time being angry.

538
00:32:50,008 --> 00:32:51,602
Thank you for your praise, Editor.

539
00:32:51,848 --> 00:32:55,157
A person with beauty and wisdom is going for an interview now.

540
00:33:09,088 --> 00:33:10,108
Hello?

541
00:33:12,048 --> 00:33:13,087
I'm not busy.

542
00:33:13,167 --> 00:33:15,238
I just had a heart-to-heart with a subordinate.

543
00:33:16,883 --> 00:33:18,282
She has a strong determination,

544
00:33:18,449 --> 00:33:20,000
just like me when I was young.

545
00:33:22,848 --> 00:33:24,868
I've already arranged it with the HR department.

546
00:33:25,528 --> 00:33:27,157
It's no problem for her to come and intern.

547
00:33:27,528 --> 00:33:29,747
But, whether she will be accepted depends on her ability.

548
00:33:30,042 --> 00:33:31,202
Maybe many people

549
00:33:31,283 --> 00:33:34,042
think I'm more suitable for research than for entrepreneurship,

550
00:33:34,447 --> 00:33:36,327
but my mentor has always encouraged me

551
00:33:36,407 --> 00:33:37,607
to apply what is learned.

552
00:33:37,687 --> 00:33:40,647
What's more important is the development of the national industry.

553
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,397
So, I need to give it a try.

554
00:33:43,584 --> 00:33:45,103
In the past,

555
00:33:45,207 --> 00:33:46,367
everyone was still using

556
00:33:46,447 --> 00:33:48,528
traditional technology to make domestic substitutes for chips.

557
00:33:48,639 --> 00:33:49,759
So, I think

558
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:52,459
we should seek something new,

559
00:33:52,609 --> 00:33:54,329
even though there may be some risks.

560
00:33:54,487 --> 00:33:55,768
Once we've succeeded,

561
00:33:55,848 --> 00:33:57,688
our products will be competitive internationally

562
00:33:57,768 --> 00:34:00,147
because we are not imitating others' achievements.

563
00:34:01,064 --> 00:34:04,167
After hearing your experience, I feel that your life,

564
00:34:04,255 --> 00:34:06,042
up to this point, has been very determined.

565
00:34:06,265 --> 00:34:09,157
Have you ever wavered or been hesitant?

566
00:34:11,687 --> 00:34:12,988
To be honest,

567
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,522
when I first entered this field,

568
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:16,275
and studied this technology,

569
00:34:16,356 --> 00:34:17,946
my original intention was to serve the society.

570
00:34:18,135 --> 00:34:19,774
But, recently, I suddenly realized

571
00:34:19,855 --> 00:34:21,606
that with Le'an Technology's current development,

572
00:34:21,687 --> 00:34:25,207
if I still blindly consider research-level matters only,

573
00:34:25,287 --> 00:34:27,962
without taking my team members' feelings and opinions into account,

574
00:34:28,128 --> 00:34:29,757
I'm doing them a disservice.

575
00:34:30,393 --> 00:34:32,072
Le'an is not just mine.

576
00:34:32,207 --> 00:34:34,147
It is the hard work of our entire team.

577
00:34:34,304 --> 00:34:38,038
So, if you ask me if I ever hesitated or wavered,

578
00:34:38,767 --> 00:34:43,317
right now is the moment I am most hesitant and wavering.

579
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,760
Mr. Chen,

580
00:34:48,103 --> 00:34:50,528
although the things we face are different,

581
00:34:50,608 --> 00:34:52,108
I understand you.

582
00:34:52,327 --> 00:34:53,830
There are some things that may be difficult at the start,

583
00:34:53,911 --> 00:34:55,391
with only you persisting.

584
00:34:55,528 --> 00:34:57,207
Every step is difficult during this time.

585
00:34:57,287 --> 00:35:00,267
Even when others join in later, it's not easy.

586
00:35:00,488 --> 00:35:01,808
But in this era,

587
00:35:01,888 --> 00:35:03,607
having a career ideal and putting it into practice

588
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:05,786
is already a very fortunate thing.

589
00:35:06,088 --> 00:35:08,634
I believe that as long as you persist,

590
00:35:08,715 --> 00:35:10,306
there are infinite possibilities.

591
00:35:54,608 --> 00:35:55,928
Delicious! Really delicious!

592
00:35:56,008 --> 00:35:57,808
Uncle, not only are you good in business,

593
00:35:57,888 --> 00:35:58,928
you also know how to cook.

594
00:35:59,008 --> 00:36:00,757
Your charm is unbeatable.

595
00:36:01,767 --> 00:36:03,253
If you like it, eat more.

596
00:36:03,334 --> 00:36:04,714
Once you're full, you can go.

597
00:36:06,327 --> 00:36:08,402
Go? Where?

598
00:36:19,856 --> 00:36:22,255
Uncle, I suddenly remembered I had an appointment.

599
00:36:22,336 --> 00:36:24,056
I'll go first. Eat slowly.

600
00:36:24,137 --> 00:36:25,277
Qin Shi Yue,

601
00:36:26,664 --> 00:36:28,264
if you dare to step out of this door,

602
00:36:28,367 --> 00:36:30,358
I'll deactivate your card right away.

603
00:36:31,528 --> 00:36:33,048
(It doesn't matter if the card is deactivated.)

604
00:36:33,206 --> 00:36:35,122
(I'll just ask Grandpa for some money.)

605
00:36:37,093 --> 00:36:38,893
You can ask your Grandpa for money.

606
00:36:39,002 --> 00:36:40,888
But, you shouldn't think of coming back here.

607
00:36:40,968 --> 00:36:42,008
I'll change the password.

608
00:36:42,088 --> 00:36:43,388
Think it over.

609
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:53,207
Uncle, you're the best. You care for me the most.

610
00:36:53,287 --> 00:36:54,368
You love me the most.

611
00:36:54,448 --> 00:36:56,667
You wouldn't do this to me, right?

612
00:36:56,888 --> 00:36:58,127
My love is deep.

613
00:36:58,207 --> 00:36:59,918
That's why I discipline you strictly.

614
00:37:01,327 --> 00:37:03,837
How long have I been back?

615
00:37:04,921 --> 00:37:08,518
Just give me some time to adjust to life in China.

616
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:10,930
Don't act like you're not used to the environment here.

617
00:37:11,088 --> 00:37:13,008
You've been traveling around the world since young.

618
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:14,797
You're used to any environment.

619
00:37:17,088 --> 00:37:19,837
Uncle,

620
00:37:20,657 --> 00:37:23,287
I'm at least a graduate of a prestigious university.

621
00:37:23,367 --> 00:37:24,647
You're selling me off like this?

622
00:37:24,727 --> 00:37:26,747
And, for just a few thousand a month?

623
00:37:26,893 --> 00:37:28,604
This is a losing deal.

624
00:37:29,489 --> 00:37:31,128
You're overestimating yourself, aren't you?

625
00:37:31,247 --> 00:37:33,667
An intern isn't worth that much money.

626
00:37:34,528 --> 00:37:36,607
If it's not for money, why should I go to work?

627
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:38,247
Our family doesn't lack money.

628
00:37:38,327 --> 00:37:41,408
I'm neither a problem girl nor do I cause trouble.

629
00:37:41,488 --> 00:37:43,157
Isn't that enough?

630
00:37:46,128 --> 00:37:47,468
Qin Shi Yue.

631
00:37:48,207 --> 00:37:50,687
Work is not just a tool for making money.

632
00:37:50,767 --> 00:37:53,402
It is also a reflection of a person's sense of social responsibility

633
00:37:53,483 --> 00:37:55,152
and personal value.

634
00:37:55,647 --> 00:37:58,518
If you don't lack anything and have the energy to spare,

635
00:37:58,647 --> 00:38:02,388
then why not do something meaningful for society and others?

636
00:38:05,442 --> 00:38:06,741
Any other questions?

637
00:38:07,647 --> 00:38:09,048
If not, sit down and have your breakfast.

638
00:38:09,128 --> 00:38:10,637
After we eat, I'll take you there.

639
00:38:45,327 --> 00:38:46,522
Let's go.

640
00:39:00,807 --> 00:39:01,948
Stop the car.

641
00:39:22,877 --> 00:39:25,116
Good morning. You stayed up late again?

642
00:39:25,648 --> 00:39:27,726
I have some good news. I just heard that our department

643
00:39:27,807 --> 00:39:29,602
is getting two new interns.

644
00:39:29,795 --> 00:39:31,122
What's so good about that?

645
00:39:31,296 --> 00:39:33,722
Of course it's good news. Don't you want to get an intern?

646
00:39:33,819 --> 00:39:36,454
You're so busy. It'd be nice to have someone work as your assistant.

647
00:39:36,589 --> 00:39:38,682
- And, you can even avoid staying up late.   - Don't joke around.

648
00:39:38,763 --> 00:39:41,295
It's not certain yet who would be helping whom with miscellaneous matters.

649
00:39:46,381 --> 00:39:48,482
Do you know what she's going to do?

650
00:39:49,048 --> 00:39:51,038
No, and I don't care.

651
00:39:51,767 --> 00:39:54,647
I heard she got an interview with an important figure.

652
00:39:54,727 --> 00:39:56,918
I guess she's going for the interview.

653
00:39:57,488 --> 00:40:00,918
Looks like she's sure to get the next headline coverage.

654
00:40:03,448 --> 00:40:04,867
Then, I wish her luck.

655
00:40:06,488 --> 00:40:08,637
You can rest assured when she's here with me.

656
00:40:08,867 --> 00:40:10,536
Although she's a bit late,

657
00:40:12,608 --> 00:40:15,428
it's still her first day of work after all. She'll just have to adjust.

658
00:40:16,327 --> 00:40:17,428
Don't worry.

659
00:40:17,546 --> 00:40:19,336
I'll work first and we'll talk later.

660
00:40:23,768 --> 00:40:26,479
This is the new intern we recruited for our team. Have a look.

661
00:40:29,362 --> 00:40:31,322
We don't need an intern for now.

662
00:40:31,464 --> 00:40:32,920
Let's leave her for the other teams.

663
00:40:33,026 --> 00:40:35,006
Xu Yu Ling's team already has one.

664
00:40:35,367 --> 00:40:37,197
This one has been assigned to you.

665
00:40:37,287 --> 00:40:38,347
Lead her.

666
00:40:38,877 --> 00:40:41,888
Ms. Yi. My workload is already heavy enough.

667
00:40:41,968 --> 00:40:44,548
I really don't have the time and energy to take on a new person.

668
00:40:44,728 --> 00:40:47,048
I know your workload is heavy.

669
00:40:47,129 --> 00:40:48,970
That's why I specially found you a helper

670
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,797
to help you take photos and organize materials.

671
00:40:57,075 --> 00:40:58,876
Let's be honest here.

672
00:40:59,009 --> 00:41:00,688
What's the background of this intern?

673
00:41:00,831 --> 00:41:02,171
All I can tell you is

674
00:41:02,448 --> 00:41:05,717
we hired her after careful consideration.

675
00:41:06,408 --> 00:41:08,277
So, I have to accept it right?

676
00:41:10,488 --> 00:41:13,468
From the work perspective, this is a training task that I've assigned you.

677
00:41:18,847 --> 00:41:20,307
From a more personal perspective,

678
00:41:21,847 --> 00:41:23,558
consider it as me owing you a favor.

679
00:41:26,968 --> 00:41:28,068
Alright.

680
00:41:28,448 --> 00:41:29,482
Don't worry, Editor.

681
00:41:29,576 --> 00:41:31,242
I will take good care of her.

682
00:41:38,167 --> 00:41:40,642
She graduated from a prestigious university where the tuition fee is high.

683
00:41:40,752 --> 00:41:42,362
She's from a rich family.

684
00:41:42,448 --> 00:41:44,167
Why doesn't she just stay at home?

685
00:41:44,248 --> 00:41:46,268
Why did she come here and work in the news industry?

686
00:41:47,033 --> 00:41:49,182
Not bad, and she's pretty.

687
00:41:49,523 --> 00:41:51,510
Her qualifications are even prettier.

688
00:41:51,603 --> 00:41:53,353
She's a junior of our editor-in-chief.

689
00:41:53,434 --> 00:41:54,581
She's a top student, alright?

690
00:41:54,662 --> 00:41:55,841
What are you worried about?

691
00:41:56,968 --> 00:41:58,518
Look at her grades.

692
00:42:03,448 --> 00:42:07,042
Her CGPA is just barely enough to graduate.

693
00:42:08,432 --> 00:42:09,966
Look at her resume. She even put in that

694
00:42:10,048 --> 00:42:11,809
she was the champion of the campus singing competition.

695
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:14,089
You can see she doesn't have much to show for.

696
00:42:14,232 --> 00:42:15,903
She just got by in college.

697
00:42:16,151 --> 00:42:18,671
From her background, you can tell she's surely a spoiled rich girl.

698
00:42:18,767 --> 00:42:19,988
This is 100% the case.

699
00:42:21,488 --> 00:42:23,127
The editor really treated you "well."

700
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,402
She gave you a troublemaker.

701
00:42:25,498 --> 00:42:27,642
You can't blame her for things, and you can't scold her.
