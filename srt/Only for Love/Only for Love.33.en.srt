00:01:31,042 --> 00:01:36,041
(Only For Love)

2
00:01:36,122 --> 00:01:39,002
(Episode 33)

3
00:02:16,525 --> 00:02:18,322
You've been standing here for 10 minutes.

4
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,122
What are you doing?

5
00:02:21,965 --> 00:02:23,436
Enjoying my beauty.

6
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:31,482
Why are you standing here?

7
00:02:31,828 --> 00:02:33,372
Enjoying your beauty.

8
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:39,842
Drink this to help you sober up.

9
00:02:59,326 --> 00:03:01,202
Are you done looking at me?

10
00:03:02,733 --> 00:03:03,754
Yes.

11
00:03:06,285 --> 00:03:07,802
Are you leaving already?

12
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,680
Do you want me to stay the night instead of leaving?

13
00:03:16,397 --> 00:03:17,642
No.

14
00:03:17,937 --> 00:03:20,618
I'm just thinking whether or not I should see you off.

15
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:21,899
After all, you are so drunk.

16
00:03:21,995 --> 00:03:23,204
If you go missing,

17
00:03:23,285 --> 00:03:24,716
I'll lose a boyfriend.

18
00:03:28,674 --> 00:03:31,285
(If you say that I don't have a boyfriend because)

19
00:03:31,396 --> 00:03:32,596
(I haven't done well enough, )

20
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,157
(I'll probably show up in Legal Report tomorrow)

21
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:37,787
(as a finance journalist who killed the CEO.)

22
00:03:37,878 --> 00:03:39,562
(For money or for love?)

23
00:03:55,046 --> 00:03:57,356
I won't let you lose your boyfriend.

24
00:04:01,213 --> 00:04:02,763
Rest earlier. I'll get going now.

25
00:04:05,084 --> 00:04:06,124
Wait.

26
00:04:08,218 --> 00:04:09,479
Give me your phone.

27
00:04:27,477 --> 00:04:28,922
Okay. You can go now.

28
00:04:29,237 --> 00:04:30,917
- Be careful. - Good night.

29
00:04:54,357 --> 00:04:56,346
Yue, eat properly.

30
00:05:01,206 --> 00:05:02,386
Beloved Baby.

31
00:05:10,182 --> 00:05:12,202
Who's Beloved Baby?

32
00:05:12,511 --> 00:05:13,820
Is it Shu...

33
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,322
Forget what I said.

34
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,649
Hello.

35
00:05:21,206 --> 00:05:22,884
- (Are you up?) - Yes.

36
00:05:23,965 --> 00:05:25,705
- (Have you eaten?) - I'm eating now.

37
00:05:28,075 --> 00:05:29,105
Anything else?

38
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:31,744
(No. I just miss you.)

39
00:05:36,315 --> 00:05:37,454
Your girlfriend?

40
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:48,197
I didn't know that you could be so sickeningly sweet.

41
00:05:48,405 --> 00:05:50,315
Beloved Baby?

42
00:05:50,868 --> 00:05:52,202
Aren't you going to work yet?

43
00:05:55,002 --> 00:05:57,721
Grandpa, Mom, Uncle. I'm going to work now.

44
00:05:57,802 --> 00:05:58,962
Go on.

45
00:06:02,365 --> 00:06:03,386
Shi Yan.

46
00:06:04,876 --> 00:06:06,546
Choose a day and bring her home.

47
00:06:10,886 --> 00:06:11,946
I'll ask her.

48
00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:22,728
Looks like you've benefited a lot from this business trip.

49
00:06:25,206 --> 00:06:26,206
Quite.

50
00:06:27,566 --> 00:06:29,806
Looks like you are not just talking about the interview.

51
00:06:31,977 --> 00:06:33,177
Are you in a relationship now?

52
00:06:37,646 --> 00:06:38,882
No matter who he is,

53
00:06:39,068 --> 00:06:40,682
don't let him affect your job.

54
00:06:41,206 --> 00:06:42,564
Don't worry, Ms. Yi.

55
00:06:42,683 --> 00:06:45,193
Love and career are equally important to me.

56
00:06:47,364 --> 00:06:48,503
Does he treat you well?

57
00:06:50,915 --> 00:06:52,544
I'm very happy when I'm with him.

58
00:06:53,925 --> 00:06:55,162
It's good that you are happy.

59
00:06:56,806 --> 00:06:58,042
Ms. Yi.

60
00:06:58,165 --> 00:07:00,596
When are you going to be in a sweet relationship too?

61
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:06,042
Stop it. Don't make fun of me just because you are in a sweet relationship.

62
00:07:06,318 --> 00:07:07,810
I'm not young anymore.

63
00:07:07,891 --> 00:07:09,742
I can't possibly be like all of you young ladies.

64
00:07:09,766 --> 00:07:11,066
Why not?

65
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:13,354
There's no age limit for someone to be in a relationship.

66
00:07:13,378 --> 00:07:15,249
Just go for it if you have someone you like.

67
00:07:18,692 --> 00:07:20,252
I'll go out and write my article first.

68
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:19,082
- Guan Ji. - Ms. Tang.

69
00:08:20,126 --> 00:08:21,206
Take a seat.

70
00:08:28,165 --> 00:08:29,205
Thank you.

71
00:08:30,566 --> 00:08:31,762
Phoenix narcissus.

72
00:08:37,465 --> 00:08:39,242
As soon as we set up a time to meet,

73
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,796
my dad kept telling me repeatedly

74
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,442
that you liked this tea.

75
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:53,231
I promised him that I would not forget.

76
00:08:53,255 --> 00:08:54,642
But he was still worried.

77
00:08:54,995 --> 00:08:56,981
He asked me to call the tea house to prepare the tea.

78
00:08:57,005 --> 00:08:59,324
So, I had to call the tea house in front of him

79
00:08:59,442 --> 00:09:00,642
to ease his worries.

80
00:09:01,605 --> 00:09:03,604
It was already very late when I got back last night.

81
00:09:03,628 --> 00:09:05,108
And he was waiting for me downstairs.

82
00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:07,389
I thought that something urgent had happened.

83
00:09:07,852 --> 00:09:10,032
Can you guess what he told me?

84
00:09:13,725 --> 00:09:16,995
Phoenix narcissus is native to Fenghuang Mountain in Guangdong.

85
00:09:17,694 --> 00:09:19,515
When you drink it, it can alleviate your cough

86
00:09:19,539 --> 00:09:20,899
and nourish your body immediately.

87
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:22,706
To this day,

88
00:09:22,844 --> 00:09:24,793
it already has a history of more than 900 years.

89
00:09:25,876 --> 00:09:28,095
The biggest surviving phoenix narcissus

90
00:09:28,454 --> 00:09:29,804
is called the mega narcissus.

91
00:09:30,427 --> 00:09:32,547
I asked him why he was telling me about those things.

92
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,211
And he got shy.

93
00:09:35,086 --> 00:09:36,766
He told me that you are shy with strangers

94
00:09:37,126 --> 00:09:39,286
and he was afraid that it would be awkward between us.

95
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:42,147
I comforted him and told him that no matter how awkward it'd be,

96
00:09:42,171 --> 00:09:43,571
I couldn't just memorize something.

97
00:09:51,845 --> 00:09:54,076
My dad cares about you.

98
00:09:56,108 --> 00:09:58,459
And he cares about you a lot.

99
00:10:10,286 --> 00:10:11,348
I know.

100
00:10:16,286 --> 00:10:17,545
He's capable

101
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,402
of protecting you well.

102
00:10:20,845 --> 00:10:23,235
And you are strong enough

103
00:10:23,965 --> 00:10:25,682
to protect yourself well.

104
00:10:31,605 --> 00:10:32,882
This doesn't make sense.

105
00:10:34,326 --> 00:10:35,386
What?

106
00:10:36,526 --> 00:10:38,129
You've known my dad

107
00:10:38,326 --> 00:10:39,626
for decades, right?

108
00:10:39,965 --> 00:10:42,346
Did he tell you that we didn't get along well?

109
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,200
Or that I was such a failure

110
00:10:44,286 --> 00:10:47,235
who was afraid of losing my position as the successor of Guan Capital?

111
00:10:47,926 --> 00:10:49,436
Although he likes to criticize me,

112
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,662
I don't think he'll say something that's not true.

113
00:10:51,686 --> 00:10:52,785
He didn't say those things.

114
00:10:53,245 --> 00:10:55,316
He just feels that owes you a lot.

115
00:10:57,005 --> 00:10:58,115
So, you are afraid

116
00:10:58,885 --> 00:11:00,165
that you'll make it worse for me

117
00:11:00,365 --> 00:11:01,626
by being together with him.

118
00:11:06,605 --> 00:11:07,665
It means

119
00:11:09,046 --> 00:11:10,749
that my dad is very important to you too.

120
00:11:11,765 --> 00:11:14,346
His mindset and his words

121
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,265
are very important to you.

122
00:11:18,046 --> 00:11:19,642
I remember that when I was young,

123
00:11:20,645 --> 00:11:22,042
no matter how busy he was,

124
00:11:22,245 --> 00:11:24,722
he would ride together with me during weekends.

125
00:11:25,725 --> 00:11:28,545
Although getting into a relationship is up to fate,

126
00:11:29,446 --> 00:11:31,846
he only started thinking about his own personal relationship

127
00:11:32,635 --> 00:11:34,344
after I took over the company.

128
00:11:35,576 --> 00:11:38,242
So, he doesn't owe me anything.

129
00:11:39,046 --> 00:11:40,842
He has given me a lot of love

130
00:11:41,046 --> 00:11:42,562
and the best education.

131
00:11:43,806 --> 00:11:45,042
Now,

132
00:11:45,286 --> 00:11:47,002
he wants to give you his love.

133
00:11:48,286 --> 00:11:49,722
As his son,

134
00:11:50,086 --> 00:11:51,986
I hope that you can give him a chance.

135
00:11:53,926 --> 00:11:54,986
Guan Ji.

136
00:11:56,005 --> 00:11:57,145
Thank you.

137
00:11:59,924 --> 00:12:03,115
I really cherish this relationship with your father.

138
00:12:04,086 --> 00:12:06,015
That's why we have many things to consider.

139
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:09,205
You are of course the first person who we have to think about.

140
00:12:09,806 --> 00:12:11,122
As an elder,

141
00:12:11,495 --> 00:12:13,122
I should've set up a meeting with you.

142
00:12:13,221 --> 00:12:15,290
But you've beaten me to it.

143
00:12:17,485 --> 00:12:21,155
What you said today is very important to me.

144
00:12:24,725 --> 00:12:25,986
But now,

145
00:12:26,326 --> 00:12:29,305
it seems like I have to give him an answer.

146
00:12:31,566 --> 00:12:32,926
I'll wait for your good news then.

147
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,620
Here.

148
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,709
Okay. I can go there with Chen Kang.

149
00:12:42,206 --> 00:12:43,956
No problem. See you then.

150
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,140
Are you done with the employment procedures?

151
00:12:52,926 --> 00:12:54,025
Shi Yan.

152
00:12:55,765 --> 00:12:58,556
How is it going with Le'an?

153
00:13:03,109 --> 00:13:06,395
Mr. Mo went to see my dad before he left.

154
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,602
And my dad went to see your dad and Mr. Qin.

155
00:13:11,526 --> 00:13:13,802
Le'an is in a precarious situation now.

156
00:13:13,915 --> 00:13:16,305
If they can't complete its technical upgrade this time,

157
00:13:16,446 --> 00:13:19,436
our investments will be at a loss.

158
00:13:20,923 --> 00:13:22,394
Have you come up with a solution?

159
00:13:23,406 --> 00:13:25,716
How about I ask my dad to help you?

160
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,613
Don't make it difficult for your dad.

161
00:13:29,105 --> 00:13:30,486
I have some ideas.

162
00:13:30,567 --> 00:13:32,447
And I'll meet up with Chen Kang this afternoon.

163
00:13:32,566 --> 00:13:34,316
But I don't know if we'll be able

164
00:13:34,885 --> 00:13:35,986
to solve this issue or not.

165
00:13:44,779 --> 00:13:45,881
Just these?

166
00:13:46,645 --> 00:13:47,795
Yes.

167
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,280
Our team is not mature enough yet. It's still a work in progress.

168
00:13:51,485 --> 00:13:52,956
We can't make much real progress.

169
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:55,019
I'm doing my best to speed it up.

170
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,199
But I'm sure you know

171
00:13:56,566 --> 00:13:58,486
that it's difficult to do something by yourself.

172
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,045
I need more time

173
00:14:00,605 --> 00:14:01,822
and more helpers.

174
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:09,235
I'll leave the rest to you then.

175
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:13,262
Mr. Chen. Mr. Yi from Dark Horse Technology is here to see you.

176
00:14:15,406 --> 00:14:16,586
Invite him in.

177
00:14:18,538 --> 00:14:19,861
Since we are done, I'll get going now.

178
00:14:19,885 --> 00:14:22,442
Okay. Thank you for making a trip here.

179
00:14:23,312 --> 00:14:25,562
What a coincidence. You are here too, Mr. Shi.

180
00:14:26,493 --> 00:14:27,682
Please stay, Mr. Shi.

181
00:14:28,764 --> 00:14:30,682
I have something to discuss with Mr. Chen.

182
00:14:30,798 --> 00:14:33,468
How about you sit in with us?

183
00:14:39,636 --> 00:14:41,722
Why did you come here today,

184
00:14:42,283 --> 00:14:43,463
Mr. Yi?

185
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:45,282
I'll be frank with you then.

186
00:14:45,775 --> 00:14:47,793
I'm here today to talk to you

187
00:14:47,917 --> 00:14:49,562
about the acquisition of Le'an

188
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,150
by Dark Horse.

189
00:14:51,981 --> 00:14:54,930
Le'an laboratory is almost at a standstill now.

190
00:14:55,092 --> 00:14:57,940
The result that Bruce left behind for you is of no significance to you.

191
00:14:58,187 --> 00:14:59,408
Cooperating with Dark Horse

192
00:14:59,772 --> 00:15:01,790
is the best way to pull Le'an out of this predicament.

193
00:15:01,814 --> 00:15:04,484
Impossible! Let me tell you. I'll never agree to it!

194
00:15:05,532 --> 00:15:06,554
Mr. Yi.

195
00:15:06,668 --> 00:15:09,619
Don't forget who's responsible for Le'an's predicament today.

196
00:15:16,245 --> 00:15:17,359
Mr. Chen.

197
00:15:18,046 --> 00:15:19,250
There's no need to be mad.

198
00:15:19,446 --> 00:15:21,706
It's just healthy competition.

199
00:15:22,326 --> 00:15:23,802
Just like Le'an, Dark Horse

200
00:15:24,077 --> 00:15:26,587
is trying to develop our own local mmWave chips too.

201
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:29,435
We have the same goal and the same direction.

202
00:15:29,645 --> 00:15:30,746
We need to bury the hatchet

203
00:15:30,965 --> 00:15:32,362
and join our forces

204
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:35,933
so that we can grasp the future and preemptive opportunities in our hands.

205
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:44,530
Mr. Chen, think about what I said.

206
00:15:48,388 --> 00:15:49,428
Mr. Shi.

207
00:15:50,547 --> 00:15:52,267
Maybe you can help me to convince Mr. Chen.

208
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,311
I'll take my leave now.

209
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:18,030
Are you coming back from your trip today? What time will you arrive?

210
00:16:18,054 --> 00:16:19,966
(Seven. Why?)

211
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:21,954
(Are you going to pick me up?)

212
00:16:22,035 --> 00:16:23,152
Take a guess.

213
00:16:50,767 --> 00:16:54,316
Sir, please take me to T2 of Jiangcheng International Airport. Thank you.

214
00:16:55,895 --> 00:16:57,202
What are you playing at?

215
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,442
You don't even bring flowers when you pick up your girlfriend from work.

216
00:17:00,844 --> 00:17:02,394
So, you are just a designated driver.

217
00:17:44,885 --> 00:17:45,952
How much is it?

218
00:17:46,033 --> 00:17:48,182
Just a total of 1,905.

219
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,390
That's so specific.

220
00:17:50,556 --> 00:17:52,185
Did you get rich by robbing others?

221
00:17:52,286 --> 00:17:54,185
No. I make money by working hard.

222
00:18:09,471 --> 00:18:11,791
This driver knows how to give someone a surprise.

223
00:18:23,726 --> 00:18:26,538
(Baby, I ran into Song Yue Lan.)

224
00:18:26,741 --> 00:18:29,765
(Oh my God, she's not using the VIP passage. Are you coming or not?)

225
00:18:29,846 --> 00:18:31,381
(Hurry up and come to the arrival hall.)

226
00:18:31,405 --> 00:18:34,321
(So many people are here taking photos with her, and she didn't say no.)

227
00:18:34,402 --> 00:18:35,842
Wait for me. I'll be there at once.

228
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,442
Song Yue Lan!

229
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:02,602
Song Yue Lan!

230
00:19:10,957 --> 00:19:12,706
Bye.

231
00:19:14,642 --> 00:19:17,019
- Bye! - Bye!

232
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,882
- Bye! - Bye!

233
00:19:23,082 --> 00:19:24,266
She's so beautiful.

234
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:26,642
She looks even better in real life.

235
00:19:28,288 --> 00:19:30,195
I think she's just a bit younger than my mom.

236
00:19:30,286 --> 00:19:32,115
But how can she look so much younger?

237
00:19:32,593 --> 00:19:33,805
A star is indeed different.

238
00:19:33,886 --> 00:19:36,186
It's like they are 10 years younger than others.

239
00:19:37,766 --> 00:19:38,941
During her concert,

240
00:19:39,022 --> 00:19:41,765
she sang one song after another for more than two hours straight.

241
00:19:41,891 --> 00:19:43,642
She's physically fit too.

242
00:19:43,854 --> 00:19:45,994
I feel ashamed as someone who's still in her 20s.

243
00:19:47,255 --> 00:19:48,575
She's indeed a superstar.

244
00:19:48,678 --> 00:19:49,882
She's really amazing.

245
00:19:50,282 --> 00:19:52,006
Why is she not married?

246
00:19:52,086 --> 00:19:55,228
Many artists of the same batch have already retired.

247
00:19:55,314 --> 00:19:56,874
She's the only one who's still active.

248
00:19:56,955 --> 00:19:58,626
She even holds a concert every year.

249
00:20:00,326 --> 00:20:01,326
Wait.

250
00:20:01,468 --> 00:20:03,468
Before this, I heard from Da Zhuang and the others

251
00:20:03,678 --> 00:20:05,505
that she got married in secret a long time ago

252
00:20:05,529 --> 00:20:06,882
and gave birth to two sons.

253
00:20:07,683 --> 00:20:09,762
Stop listening to that kind of nonsense.

254
00:20:09,925 --> 00:20:12,473
She has released one album after another for decades.

255
00:20:12,564 --> 00:20:14,225
And her concerts are always full.

256
00:20:14,306 --> 00:20:16,565
She has never disappeared from the eyes of her audience.

257
00:20:16,685 --> 00:20:18,516
She wouldn't have time to give birth.

258
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:24,802
A few years ago, she was seen wearing a diamond ring on her ring finger.

259
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,565
It doesn't mean that she's married.

260
00:20:27,645 --> 00:20:28,886
And they already clarified

261
00:20:28,967 --> 00:20:30,687
that it was a ring from her sponsor, right?

262
00:20:31,281 --> 00:20:32,301
Is that so?

263
00:20:33,053 --> 00:20:34,842
But her song, Dear Gift,

264
00:20:34,978 --> 00:20:36,498
is clearly a song written for a child.

265
00:20:36,565 --> 00:20:37,744
You know that, right?

266
00:20:38,289 --> 00:20:39,934
It's just an artist's creation.

267
00:20:40,025 --> 00:20:41,922
It doesn't mean that she has gone through it.

268
00:20:42,096 --> 00:20:43,863
Otherwise, how depressing it'll be

269
00:20:43,954 --> 00:20:45,522
for those who sing sad love songs?

270
00:20:45,813 --> 00:20:46,947
If we follow your logic,

271
00:20:47,064 --> 00:20:48,601
I write about financial projects

272
00:20:48,682 --> 00:20:51,045
that can cost up to billions every day.

273
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,036
But that money has nothing to do with me.

274
00:20:54,439 --> 00:20:56,628
What you said makes so much sense.

275
00:20:57,312 --> 00:20:58,594
Stop gossiping about her.

276
00:20:58,685 --> 00:21:00,125
If she really got married in secret,

277
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:03,082
I would cut off my head for you on the spot.

278
00:21:07,709 --> 00:21:10,501
- Give it to me. - It's okay. I can carry it myself.

279
00:21:11,297 --> 00:21:13,002
Just let him help you.

280
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:16,356
Or else, he'll worry about me looking for a more gentlemanly boyfriend.

281
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:19,320
Thank you, Mr. Shi.

282
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:36,962
Do you like Song Yue Lan that much?

283
00:21:38,795 --> 00:21:40,305
You know I do.

284
00:21:40,788 --> 00:21:43,368
I already told you when I went to your house for the first time.

285
00:21:43,604 --> 00:21:45,983
I really like her. I was telling the truth.

286
00:21:46,155 --> 00:21:47,336
It wasn't a pickup line.

287
00:21:49,445 --> 00:21:52,513
You left me here all by myself for her.

288
00:21:55,085 --> 00:21:57,641
Didn't you say that I'm the only one you like?

289
00:22:02,526 --> 00:22:04,882
Are you jealous of a woman?

290
00:22:04,989 --> 00:22:06,722
I think you can bottle it up and sell it.

291
00:22:07,853 --> 00:22:10,809
And I remember that you like her too.

292
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:12,602
You have so many of her records at home.

293
00:22:16,078 --> 00:22:18,002
Are you jealous of me right now

294
00:22:18,088 --> 00:22:20,006
because you were too shy

295
00:22:20,087 --> 00:22:21,347
to take a photo with her?

296
00:22:27,526 --> 00:22:28,765
You are my boyfriend.

297
00:22:28,845 --> 00:22:30,018
I can see you every day.

298
00:22:30,109 --> 00:22:31,275
But for Song Yue Lan,

299
00:22:31,366 --> 00:22:33,140
this may be the only chance that I have

300
00:22:33,231 --> 00:22:35,062
in my entire life to be so close to her.

301
00:22:35,619 --> 00:22:37,048
You understand that, right?

302
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:39,125
No.

303
00:22:39,845 --> 00:22:41,762
How can you be so irrational?

304
00:22:42,703 --> 00:22:44,542
I've always been irrational.

305
00:22:44,676 --> 00:22:46,002
Don't you know that already?

306
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,230
(What did I do to deserve Shi Yan after letting him go through)

307
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,482
(all the deceptions and lies by himself?)

308
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:04,323
(Like what Shan Shan said, )

309
00:23:04,405 --> 00:23:05,802
(I was the one in the wrong.)

310
00:23:05,925 --> 00:23:08,085
(I managed to earn his forgiveness easily)

311
00:23:08,196 --> 00:23:10,842
(without having to pay any price for it.)

312
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,395
(Will Shi Yan comes to his senses one day)

313
00:23:14,845 --> 00:23:17,442
(and decides to change the course of his life?)

314
00:23:43,606 --> 00:23:44,997
What's wrong with you today?

315
00:23:46,434 --> 00:23:47,615
I'm fine.

316
00:23:49,486 --> 00:23:50,962
You don't want to tell me about it?

317
00:23:52,148 --> 00:23:53,408
No.

318
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:57,362
It's just that I feel glad

319
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,162
but also a little bit of fear.

320
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,281
What are you afraid of?

321
00:24:07,566 --> 00:24:09,715
I'm afraid that you are still mad at me.

322
00:24:10,772 --> 00:24:12,162
I keep thinking

323
00:24:12,258 --> 00:24:14,282
that you should be out to seek revenge

324
00:24:14,733 --> 00:24:17,523
by tricking me into falling in love with you and breaking up with me later.

325
00:24:17,547 --> 00:24:18,847
A tooth for a tooth.

326
00:24:33,619 --> 00:24:34,762
What are you doing?

327
00:24:34,947 --> 00:24:36,128
A tooth for a tooth.

328
00:24:41,263 --> 00:24:43,802
Actually, I just want to ask you

329
00:24:44,365 --> 00:24:46,162
not to lie to me.

330
00:24:46,629 --> 00:24:48,642
It really doesn't feel good to get lied to.

331
00:24:52,806 --> 00:24:54,796
I'm such a double-standard person.

332
00:25:03,486 --> 00:25:05,566
I do want to trick you into falling in love with me.

333
00:25:07,326 --> 00:25:08,434
Zheng Shu Yi.

334
00:25:08,885 --> 00:25:11,005
Do you think you are the only double-standard person?

335
00:25:32,246 --> 00:25:34,675
I can't take it anymore.

336
00:25:37,205 --> 00:25:38,596
Just from a kiss?

337
00:25:43,992 --> 00:25:45,049
Shi Yan.

338
00:25:46,165 --> 00:25:47,875
I've thought about it a lot today.

339
00:25:48,653 --> 00:25:50,242
And maybe I've talked a lot.

340
00:25:50,526 --> 00:25:52,206
I hope that you won't get annoyed with me.

341
00:25:53,726 --> 00:25:55,276
When are you not talkative?

342
00:26:02,025 --> 00:26:04,202
I really like you.

343
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:07,282
It has nothing to do with anything else.

344
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,402
Although I did have an ulterior motive

345
00:26:09,483 --> 00:26:11,762
when I approached you in the beginning.

346
00:26:12,369 --> 00:26:14,642
I don't know what I can do now.

347
00:26:15,165 --> 00:26:18,236
I just want to say that I really like you

348
00:26:18,925 --> 00:26:20,026
right now.

349
00:26:25,405 --> 00:26:26,705
How can you prove it?

350
00:26:28,134 --> 00:26:29,682
How can I prove it?

351
00:26:29,966 --> 00:26:32,166
Do you want me to take out my heart and show it to you?

352
00:26:33,878 --> 00:26:35,399
Yi Yang wants to acquire Le'an.

353
00:26:35,526 --> 00:26:38,036
How about you ask him to return Bruce to Le'an?

354
00:26:39,726 --> 00:26:41,282
I can tell him that.

355
00:26:41,408 --> 00:26:42,848
But I'm afraid that you'll tie me up

356
00:26:43,006 --> 00:26:45,185
and lock me up at home if I try to go to him.

357
00:26:49,205 --> 00:26:50,682
So, you can't prove it.

358
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,063
Zheng Shu Yi.

359
00:27:02,445 --> 00:27:04,996
I've already left those things in the past.

360
00:27:05,369 --> 00:27:08,002
So, you should leave them in the past too.

361
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:09,125
Understand?

362
00:27:14,006 --> 00:27:15,406
You are my girlfriend.

363
00:27:15,486 --> 00:27:16,922
It has nothing to do with anyone.

364
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:18,803
You are the girlfriend who I've chosen.

365
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:22,361
I don't need a reason or a script for it.

366
00:27:22,687 --> 00:27:24,836
We are just like all the other couples out there.

367
00:27:30,088 --> 00:27:31,802
We are different from them.

368
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:35,533
Others will not call their girlfriends by their full names.

369
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,464
I got it.

370
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,060
Yi.

371
00:27:53,526 --> 00:27:55,915
Rest earlier. I'll get going now.

372
00:28:31,727 --> 00:28:32,727
Where is he?

373
00:28:33,655 --> 00:28:35,775
Mr. Shi didn't tell me anything when he left the car.

374
00:28:46,471 --> 00:28:47,682
Where are you?

375
00:28:51,925 --> 00:28:54,955
How did my boyfriend go missing?

376
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,900
I should look for him carefully.

377
00:28:59,101 --> 00:29:01,322
Is he in here? No.

378
00:29:01,852 --> 00:29:02,965
What about here?

379
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:04,380
He's not in here too.

380
00:29:04,766 --> 00:29:06,066
Where are you?

381
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,042
Why are you here?

382
00:29:10,445 --> 00:29:11,842
Where should I be if not here?

383
00:29:12,246 --> 00:29:13,346
There?

384
00:29:15,405 --> 00:29:17,885
You've found your boyfriend. Why are you still standing there?

385
00:29:19,046 --> 00:29:21,225
Why did you stand behind me quietly?

386
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:24,802
It'll be disrespectful if I interrupt an actress during her act.

387
00:29:25,006 --> 00:29:26,762
I know the basic theater etiquette.

388
00:29:26,843 --> 00:29:28,243
Have you not watched a play before?

389
00:29:29,165 --> 00:29:30,346
No.

390
00:29:31,046 --> 00:29:32,482
We can do that next time.

391
00:29:34,766 --> 00:29:35,766
Get in.

392
00:29:49,165 --> 00:29:50,715
What did you do just now?

393
00:29:57,007 --> 00:29:58,282
Did you buy it for me?

394
00:29:59,205 --> 00:30:00,905
How do you know that I like this?

395
00:30:01,726 --> 00:30:02,945
How much do you like it?

396
00:30:05,318 --> 00:30:07,741
I like it so much that even if you betray me,

397
00:30:07,845 --> 00:30:10,435
I'll forgive you at once if you buy me this.

398
00:30:11,885 --> 00:30:13,648
- Do you want to drink it? - No.

399
00:30:28,206 --> 00:30:30,778
Can we not ride in this car next time?

400
00:30:31,751 --> 00:30:33,941
Why? I thought you liked this car.

401
00:30:36,006 --> 00:30:37,675
I don't like it now.

402
00:30:43,911 --> 00:30:45,461
But I like it.

403
00:31:20,526 --> 00:31:21,638
What is this?

404
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,830
A belated gift for you.

405
00:31:28,246 --> 00:31:29,796
Just one?

406
00:31:35,621 --> 00:31:37,308
(We should've celebrated)

407
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:39,260
(New Year's Day and Lunar New Year together.)

408
00:31:59,533 --> 00:32:00,882
I have parcels for you.

409
00:32:01,712 --> 00:32:02,842
Here.

410
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:07,522
Beloved Baby.

411
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:09,606
There are still some parcels for you out there.

412
00:32:21,566 --> 00:32:22,802
Have you received them?

413
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,640
(Why are there so many things?)

414
00:32:24,726 --> 00:32:25,962
They are your belated gifts.

415
00:32:26,566 --> 00:32:28,442
I was just joking about it.

416
00:32:28,806 --> 00:32:30,122
What do you want to eat tonight?

417
00:32:31,165 --> 00:32:32,165
(Hotpot.)

418
00:32:32,675 --> 00:32:34,802
(Forget it. You don't like hotpot.)

419
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:38,150
Let's go to the Nine Flavors then. I haven't been there in so long.

420
00:32:38,445 --> 00:32:40,845
- Okay. - (I have to go to work now. See you after work.)

421
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:41,991
Okay.

422
00:32:53,689 --> 00:32:55,762
- Okay. Please wait for a moment. - Thank you.

423
00:32:57,566 --> 00:32:59,195
I have to use the bathroom for a while.

424
00:33:07,263 --> 00:33:08,966
I'm sorry. I'm really...

425
00:33:11,161 --> 00:33:13,362
I'm really sorry.

426
00:33:13,605 --> 00:33:15,316
I tripped on my foot just now.

427
00:33:15,454 --> 00:33:16,923
I didn't hit you anywhere, right?

428
00:33:17,046 --> 00:33:18,046
No.

429
00:33:19,035 --> 00:33:20,254
Your coat is dirty.

430
00:33:20,345 --> 00:33:22,456
How about I wash it for you?

431
00:33:22,766 --> 00:33:24,115
I'm truly sorry.

432
00:33:24,326 --> 00:33:25,806
It's okay. You don't have to do that.

433
00:33:26,724 --> 00:33:28,682
How about I pay you back?

434
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:30,926
You can add me on WeChat. I'll pay you back.

435
00:33:31,006 --> 00:33:32,395
I'm really sorry.

436
00:33:34,069 --> 00:33:35,956
(She's hitting on him.)

437
00:33:39,205 --> 00:33:40,205
It's okay.

438
00:33:42,633 --> 00:33:44,322
I have to pay you back.

439
00:33:44,507 --> 00:33:47,242
Otherwise, I'll feel bad about it.

440
00:33:47,427 --> 00:33:49,107
And I said that you don't have to do that.

441
00:33:49,165 --> 00:33:50,486
If you want to stand here,

442
00:33:50,566 --> 00:33:52,365
can you move to another place to stand?

443
00:33:53,012 --> 00:33:55,052
You've been blocking my girlfriend for a long time.

444
00:34:04,987 --> 00:34:07,387
Why didn't you let her pay you back? It's an expensive coat.

445
00:34:07,489 --> 00:34:09,489
You should let her pay you back since she offered.

446
00:34:10,086 --> 00:34:12,046
- Shu Yi. - What is it?

447
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:15,714
Although you look cute when you are jealous...

448
00:34:15,824 --> 00:34:18,293
- I'm not jealous. - I can't bear to make you jealous.

449
00:34:23,623 --> 00:34:24,929
Nonsense.

450
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,522
I'm not jealous.

451
00:34:26,966 --> 00:34:28,636
I just feel bad for your coat.

452
00:34:28,763 --> 00:34:29,842
It's a nice coat.

453
00:34:29,915 --> 00:34:31,385
And it's ruined for nothing.

454
00:34:34,046 --> 00:34:35,597
- Hello. - (Hello.)

455
00:34:35,844 --> 00:34:37,122
(What are you doing?)

456
00:34:37,526 --> 00:34:38,786
I'm eating outside.

457
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:41,685
- Thank you. - (Are you eating together with Yue?)

458
00:34:41,765 --> 00:34:44,645
- No. - (Do you know where she is?)

459
00:34:44,725 --> 00:34:46,820
(She's not at home and she's not replying to my messages.)

460
00:34:46,844 --> 00:34:47,962
I'm not sure.

461
00:34:48,566 --> 00:34:50,156
(Who are you with?)

462
00:34:52,765 --> 00:34:54,012
My girlfriend.

463
00:34:54,165 --> 00:34:55,387
Who is it on the phone?

464
00:34:55,926 --> 00:34:56,926
My sister.

465
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:03,746
Do you want to greet my sister?

466
00:35:05,566 --> 00:35:07,676
What is it? You don't want to greet her?

467
00:35:14,205 --> 00:35:15,875
Okay then. I have to hang up now.

468
00:35:19,765 --> 00:35:24,962
By the way, why haven't I seen or heard about your sister?

469
00:35:25,043 --> 00:35:26,642
Is she not working for Mingyu?

470
00:35:32,943 --> 00:35:34,260
Why are you laughing?

471
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:38,202
Nothing. It's just that she keeps a low profile.

472
00:35:41,467 --> 00:35:43,027
If you didn't pick up her call,

473
00:35:43,152 --> 00:35:45,062
I almost forgot that you still have an elder sister.

474
00:35:45,086 --> 00:35:46,386
She keeps such a low profile.

475
00:35:50,012 --> 00:35:52,121
Do you want to meet her one day?

476
00:35:54,476 --> 00:35:55,776
Sure.

477
00:35:56,165 --> 00:35:57,842
But there's no rush.

478
00:35:57,987 --> 00:35:59,362
Give me some time to get ready.

479
00:36:00,887 --> 00:36:02,802
No rush. Take your time to get ready.

480
00:36:13,074 --> 00:36:16,294
If your sister is not working for Mingyu, what is her job then?

481
00:36:18,205 --> 00:36:20,682
She just sings and dances every day.

482
00:36:20,952 --> 00:36:22,202
She doesn't do anything else.

483
00:36:22,316 --> 00:36:23,882
She's living such a comfortable life.

484
00:36:25,794 --> 00:36:27,104
Does she look like you?

485
00:36:28,372 --> 00:36:29,512
Her and me?

486
00:36:30,285 --> 00:36:31,442
We look quite alike.

487
00:36:31,796 --> 00:36:33,466
Show me. I'm curious.

488
00:36:37,117 --> 00:36:39,802
- Let me take a look. - I don't have her photos on my phone.

489
00:36:40,574 --> 00:36:41,833
Stop lying to me.

490
00:36:41,923 --> 00:36:44,763
It's true. You can take a look yourself. The password is your birthday.

491
00:36:51,772 --> 00:36:52,858
It's okay.

492
00:36:53,125 --> 00:36:54,365
You don't have to show her to me.

493
00:36:54,389 --> 00:36:55,819
I'll see her eventually.

494
00:37:01,269 --> 00:37:03,725
Mr. Yi. Dark Horse has just entered the local market.

495
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:05,925
It's still new and it doesn't have enough experience.

496
00:37:06,116 --> 00:37:07,659
While Le'an has been here for a long time.

497
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:10,483
- I hold an important position in Le'an. I can help you... - Enough.

498
00:37:11,085 --> 00:37:12,405
Do you have anything else to say?

499
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:16,520
Before this, Le'an was doing research on Li Xue Cai and his laboratory.

500
00:37:18,846 --> 00:37:20,082
Let me give you some advice.

501
00:37:20,676 --> 00:37:21,685
What is it?

502
00:37:21,769 --> 00:37:23,822
Stop embarrassing the University of Finance and Economics

503
00:37:23,846 --> 00:37:25,356
and leave the chip industry at once.

504
00:38:04,101 --> 00:38:06,051
Not bad, Yue.

505
00:38:06,173 --> 00:38:08,642
You've improved a lot.

506
00:38:09,085 --> 00:38:11,802
It's because you've taught me well.

507
00:38:13,654 --> 00:38:16,042
My uncle even asked me to learn more from you.

508
00:38:16,392 --> 00:38:20,602
He must think that being a finance journalist is the best occupation now.

509
00:38:21,087 --> 00:38:23,202
But he emphasized

510
00:38:23,445 --> 00:38:26,395
that I should only learn the good from you, not the bad.

511
00:38:27,406 --> 00:38:28,966
How am I bad?

512
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:30,170
Ask him to explain himself.

513
00:38:30,275 --> 00:38:32,985
Have you deleted him from your contacts? Go and ask him yourself.

514
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:56,009
Jing Jing said that the editor personally informed her about it.

515
00:38:56,581 --> 00:38:58,282
She chatted with Qin Shi Yue.

516
00:38:58,556 --> 00:39:01,162
And it seems like her uncle is indeed working in Mingyu.

517
00:39:01,323 --> 00:39:03,985
Does he work in Mingyu or Mingyu Yunchuang?

518
00:39:05,366 --> 00:39:06,496
I don't know.

519
00:39:06,765 --> 00:39:07,926
But I heard

520
00:39:08,107 --> 00:39:10,995
that she's very close to the finance director of Yunchuang.

521
00:39:17,339 --> 00:39:18,599
Let me make myself clear.

522
00:39:18,715 --> 00:39:20,515
I'm not trying to be nosy about your privacy.

523
00:39:20,581 --> 00:39:22,211
We are friends.

524
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:25,042
Before this, you were in a bad shape.

525
00:39:25,406 --> 00:39:27,236
You even cried in the company.

526
00:39:28,698 --> 00:39:30,218
You were heartbroken that time, right?

527
00:39:31,165 --> 00:39:32,306
I guess.

528
00:39:34,925 --> 00:39:36,554
And you have a boyfriend now.

529
00:39:38,846 --> 00:39:41,105
What is it? What are they gossiping about again?

530
00:39:42,949 --> 00:39:45,978
It's nothing new that this kind of thing will be gossiped by others.

531
00:39:46,736 --> 00:39:48,122
They say

532
00:39:48,628 --> 00:39:51,537
that you have an extraordinary boyfriend.

533
00:39:52,645 --> 00:39:55,405
(My boyfriend is indeed extraordinary.)

534
00:39:56,605 --> 00:39:58,075
Yes. So what?

535
00:39:59,885 --> 00:40:01,235
It's nothing.

536
00:40:02,325 --> 00:40:03,554
They just say

537
00:40:03,645 --> 00:40:05,995
that your boyfriend is quite old.

538
00:40:11,163 --> 00:40:13,033
Don't be mad.

539
00:40:14,429 --> 00:40:15,962
Just tell me in private.

540
00:40:16,259 --> 00:40:17,519
Is it true?

541
00:40:18,851 --> 00:40:20,492
I already told you many times.

542
00:40:20,573 --> 00:40:23,285
If that was my goal, I didn't have to wait until now.

543
00:40:23,474 --> 00:40:25,740
My boyfriend is just more senior in terms of family rank.

544
00:40:25,764 --> 00:40:28,644
Fine. You don't have to tell me about your personal affairs.

545
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,291
I just want to remind you

546
00:40:30,669 --> 00:40:32,562
that misunderstandings can be resolved.

547
00:40:32,691 --> 00:40:35,171
There's nothing to worry about when you've done nothing wrong.

548
00:40:41,446 --> 00:40:42,861
Why did the editor ask for you?

549
00:40:43,006 --> 00:40:44,676
Was it about your boyfriend?

550
00:40:45,521 --> 00:40:47,202
You already know.

551
00:40:47,389 --> 00:40:48,962
Why didn't you tell me?

552
00:40:49,602 --> 00:40:50,741
Let me show you something.

553
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:57,006
(Guess what I heard today.)

554
00:40:57,125 --> 00:40:59,525
(You know about that intern, Qin Shi Yue, right?)

555
00:40:59,605 --> 00:41:03,075
(Zheng Shu Yi has gotten together with her uncle.)

556
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:05,083
(She's already in her 20s.)

557
00:41:05,245 --> 00:41:08,566
(I'm sure her uncle is about the same age as my dad.)

558
00:41:08,843 --> 00:41:11,757
(You can't achieve something if you don't sacrifice something.)

559
00:41:11,879 --> 00:41:14,789
(It is not something that a normal person can do.)

560
00:41:14,926 --> 00:41:16,316
Where did you get this?

561
00:41:16,605 --> 00:41:18,035
It wasn't even that hard.

562
00:41:18,165 --> 00:41:20,515
Isn't it obvious enough?

563
00:41:20,596 --> 00:41:23,196
Xu Yu Ling can't wait to tell everyone about this in every group.

564
00:41:49,765 --> 00:41:50,843
Are you looking for me?

565
00:41:51,325 --> 00:41:52,722
It's nothing much.

566
00:41:52,779 --> 00:41:54,880
I just want to talk to you about my boyfriend.

567
00:41:56,086 --> 00:41:57,362
Your boyfriend?

568
00:41:57,859 --> 00:42:00,202
What is it? You don't know about my boyfriend.

569
00:42:00,926 --> 00:42:03,442
- No. - Why do you gossip nonsense about him

570
00:42:03,523 --> 00:42:04,922
if you don't know him?

571
00:42:05,926 --> 00:42:07,114
Don't simply accuse me.

572
00:42:07,205 --> 00:42:08,445
I've never seen your boyfriend.

573
00:42:08,476 --> 00:42:09,802
How can I gossip about him?

574
00:42:10,366 --> 00:42:13,588
Yes. It's because you've never seen my boyfriend before.

575
00:42:13,677 --> 00:42:16,708
That's why you come up with your own imagination that my boyfriend is old.

576
00:42:20,452 --> 00:42:21,615
Xu Yu Ling.

577
00:42:22,269 --> 00:42:23,859
We are colleagues.

578
00:42:23,966 --> 00:42:25,646
It's normal to have a healthy competition.

579
00:42:25,725 --> 00:42:28,196
But I've never stooped to using dirty tricks.

580
00:42:28,566 --> 00:42:31,486
However, you copied the outline of my article, took away my interview,

581
00:42:31,566 --> 00:42:33,166
and now, you want to ruin my reputation.

582
00:42:33,362 --> 00:42:34,604
Don't you feel ashamed?

583
00:42:34,971 --> 00:42:37,921
Do you think that you can become successful if I'm gone?

584
00:42:38,167 --> 00:42:40,962
But before I entered the company, you were not successful too.

585
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:43,202
Or are you just jealous of me?

586
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,539
Stop accusing me of things that I didn't do.

587
00:42:45,892 --> 00:42:47,082
I didn't slander you.

588
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:48,180
Yes.

589
00:42:48,526 --> 00:42:50,156
We had some disagreements.

590
00:42:51,343 --> 00:42:53,682
But everyone was gossiping about you.

591
00:42:53,765 --> 00:42:55,842
Why do you have to say that I started it?
