00:01:31,242 --> 00:01:36,033
(Only For Love)

2
00:01:36,114 --> 00:01:39,122
(Episode 1)

3
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,379
Yu Ling.

4
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,960
Do you need any help?

5
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,079
No, thank you.

6
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,680
Let me help you.

7
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,390
This way, I can say I've been part of a major interview.

8
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,153
I heard the editor highly recommended you.

9
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,440
You're the ace journalist of our magazine.

10
00:02:09,567 --> 00:02:11,627
It has to be you doing this interview.

11
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:15,760
Yu Ling, the sales for our next issue will surely skyrocket.

12
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,879
The editor has given me such an important task.

13
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,631
I'm going to give it my all.

14
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,920
You've lost your chance to interview Shi Yan.

15
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:29,389
Why are you still reviewing your interview outline, Zheng Shu Yi?

16
00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:32,802
Shi Yan is probably an unconventional man.

17
00:02:32,883 --> 00:02:34,434
I just took another look at my outline.

18
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,820
Some questions seem too conservative.

19
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,064
They can definitely be improved.

20
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,789
I'm going to refine it further.

21
00:02:39,361 --> 00:02:40,540
Are you okay?

22
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,430
Did losing the interview opportunity turn you insane?

23
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,680
Even if you have the perfect outline,

24
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,389
Shi Yan won't turn back to you.

25
00:02:49,385 --> 00:02:52,739
I heard the editor-in-chief made a call to Mingyu Yunchuang

26
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,220
and highly recommended that person.

27
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:58,454
So, tactics matter more than competence.

28
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:00,963
There are plenty of important figures. Even if I've lost Shi Yan,

29
00:03:01,044 --> 00:03:02,559
there will still be other opportunities.

30
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,919
Having tactics can only get you one interview,

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
but competence can help you produce excellent articles.

32
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,030
Since I lack tactics, I'll keep honing my competence.

33
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,669
Too bad you can't help me see what Shi Yan actually looks like.

34
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,550
Is he handsome or not?

35
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,267
Mr. Shi, the interview with Financial Introduce

36
00:03:41,348 --> 00:03:42,799
is scheduled for 7 pm after dinner.

37
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,682
Journalist Xu Yu Ling will come to the office to interview you.

38
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,229
I don't think I picked Miss Xu as my interviewer.

39
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,760
She was strongly recommended by Financial Introduce's editor-in-chief.

40
00:03:50,872 --> 00:03:52,676
She said she has extensive experience in various aspects,

41
00:03:52,757 --> 00:03:54,722
and her writing quality is quite consistent.

42
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,322
If it's just a straightforward Q&A interview,

43
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,599
there is no need to see me in person.

44
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,469
Sending over the answers should suffice.

45
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,870
An interview should be an enlightening conversation and reflection.

46
00:04:04,456 --> 00:04:07,053
I like Miss Zheng's interview outline.

47
00:04:07,433 --> 00:04:08,633
My apologies for being empirical.

48
00:04:08,714 --> 00:04:10,385
I'll rearrange it.

49
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,602
(Zhu Xing Guo on the Currency War)

50
00:04:24,407 --> 00:04:25,747
Ms. Yi, you wanted to see me?

51
00:04:25,864 --> 00:04:27,284
Okay, bye-bye.

52
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,480
You don't need to comfort me.

53
00:04:34,623 --> 00:04:36,533
I understand, I'm fine.

54
00:04:37,237 --> 00:04:38,497
Understand what?

55
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:42,048
I know you wanted to talk to me about the interview with Shi Yan .

56
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,459
I understand.

57
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:45,309
Yu Ling has more experience than me.

58
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,160
Though there's a tiny bit of disappointment,

59
00:04:49,328 --> 00:04:52,128
my interview outline does have room for improvement.

60
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:54,119
So, there's no need for regrets.

61
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,350
I'll prepare more thoroughly next time.

62
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,750
You're dressed so nice today.

63
00:05:01,888 --> 00:05:03,248
It's my boyfriend's birthday.

64
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:05,853
I want to look pretty for him.

65
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,160
Looking at it from another perspective, if I were to interview Shi Yan,

66
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,540
I wouldn't be able to celebrate with my boyfriend tonight.

67
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,350
So, this works out fine.

68
00:05:19,282 --> 00:05:20,621
I see.

69
00:05:22,848 --> 00:05:24,187
What's the matter, Ms. Yi?

70
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,440
The staff of Yunchuang just called me.

71
00:05:27,558 --> 00:05:28,965
They said for tonight's interview,

72
00:05:29,048 --> 00:05:30,548
Shi Yan has designated you

73
00:05:33,329 --> 00:05:34,469
to conduct it.

74
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,439
It's a shame that you're celebrating your boyfriend's birthday tonight.

75
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:40,070
I suppose you don't have time. Right?

76
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:44,080
Shi Yan designated me?

77
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,590
Yes, he picked you in the end.

78
00:05:46,881 --> 00:05:48,220
It's for tonight.

79
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:50,590
Are you okay for tonight?

80
00:05:51,104 --> 00:05:52,344
Yes. I can do it.

81
00:05:52,453 --> 00:05:53,552
You sure?

82
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,999
Great, tonight at seven.

83
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,242
Shi Yan's assistant will talk to you about the details.

84
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,200
Okay, I'll go prepare right away.

85
00:06:02,337 --> 00:06:03,437
Hang on.

86
00:06:04,619 --> 00:06:06,328
What about your boyfriend?

87
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:08,882
Birthdays come every year,

88
00:06:08,976 --> 00:06:11,256
but the opportunity to interview Shi Yan is rare.

89
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:13,309
I'll wrap things up as quickly as possible,

90
00:06:13,408 --> 00:06:15,268
maybe I can still celebrate with him before midnight.

91
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,802
This is so you, Zheng Shu Yi.

92
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,999
Mr. Shi, the details for the exclusive interview have been arranged.

93
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:27,779
Shall we schedule the interview in the main conference room?

94
00:06:29,983 --> 00:06:31,293
Wasn't the representative of Le'an scheduled to come

95
00:06:31,374 --> 00:06:32,705
for a meeting in the afternoon?

96
00:06:32,786 --> 00:06:34,960
Dept. 1 had reserved the main conference room for the afternoon,

97
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,040
but they canceled it later.

98
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,918
It seems they've rescheduled the meetings

99
00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:39,999
with representatives from Lieying and Le'an to the morning.

100
00:06:41,005 --> 00:06:42,605
Both in the morning?

101
00:06:42,686 --> 00:06:44,942
Yes, the system shows that it was personally

102
00:06:45,022 --> 00:06:46,912
rearranged by Mr. Feng from Dept. 1.

103
00:06:53,456 --> 00:06:55,482
Fan, drop me off somewhere.

104
00:06:55,585 --> 00:06:56,745
I need to go back to the company.

105
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,082
Understood, Mr. Shi.

106
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,470
What about Miss Qin?

107
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,762
Go pick her up and take her back to the Shi family's mansion.

108
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,019
Yes, sir.

109
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:21,909
Impressive!

110
00:07:22,337 --> 00:07:25,482
You've already secured the cover story for nine issues this year.

111
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,522
It's unprecedented in our magazine.

112
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,590
Even the editor's record is only eight issues in a year.

113
00:07:38,337 --> 00:07:40,598
You're still having coffee? Do you even want to get better?

114
00:07:43,477 --> 00:07:45,082
Drink this instead.

115
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,839
But why do you think Yunchuang

116
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,720
suddenly changed the interview journalist?

117
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,960
It shows their boss has a keen eye.

118
00:07:54,104 --> 00:07:55,364
You mean Shi Yan?

119
00:07:55,894 --> 00:07:58,248
Shi Yan must have a keen eye indeed.

120
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,016
Otherwise, he wouldn't have turned Mingyu Yunchuang

121
00:08:01,097 --> 00:08:03,299
into such a success in just a few years.

122
00:08:04,187 --> 00:08:06,894
But he's a bit strange too.

123
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,320
When Mingyu Group was facing its toughest times,

124
00:08:09,408 --> 00:08:11,199
he left his family's company

125
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:13,679
and went out to start a new one.

126
00:08:13,842 --> 00:08:15,222
What was he thinking?

127
00:08:15,617 --> 00:08:18,602
You don't know how harsh the rumors about him were,

128
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,280
people calling him the runaway prince,

129
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:24,162
a selfish coward, and more.

130
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:27,584
There's also that girlfriend of his, the actress Bei Lin.

131
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,242
They say she dumped him immediately.

132
00:08:29,328 --> 00:08:32,487
I actually think he's pretty brave.

133
00:08:32,648 --> 00:08:33,887
Despite all the doubts,

134
00:08:33,968 --> 00:08:35,688
he still chose that path.

135
00:08:35,824 --> 00:08:37,374
That takes a lot of courage, you know.

136
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,800
It'd truly be an honor for us if we can

137
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:17,324
establish a partnership with Lieying.

138
00:09:17,405 --> 00:09:18,802
Mr. Feng, you're too kind.

139
00:09:18,905 --> 00:09:20,042
- We're practically family, after all.   - Yes, yes.

140
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:23,122
Exactly. We've been friends for so many years.

141
00:09:23,224 --> 00:09:24,283
Yes.

142
00:09:26,337 --> 00:09:27,437
Mr. Shi.

143
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,239
Get me two cold Cokes from the pantry.

144
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,419
Yes, sir.

145
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,442
I've been working on an article about Lieying lately.

146
00:09:38,592 --> 00:09:41,602
They said that Yunchuang is considering an investment.

147
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,322
You know about Lieying, right?

148
00:09:43,453 --> 00:09:45,319
They've been gaining a lot of momentum in the last couple of years.

149
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,189
Many companies want to invest in them.

150
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,000
There isn't a single clear picture of Shi Yan anywhere on the internet.

151
00:09:53,137 --> 00:09:54,617
He became even more low-key after starting his own venture,

152
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:56,917
never appearing in front of the press.

153
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:02,664
If we could get him to record an exclusive video or audio piece

154
00:10:02,882 --> 00:10:04,001
for our digital magazine,

155
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:06,089
it would surely attract a lot of readers.

156
00:10:06,489 --> 00:10:09,479
You're still thinking about upgrading the digital magazine?

157
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:13,067
Financial information is closely related to everyone.

158
00:10:13,148 --> 00:10:14,267
If we don't revamp it

159
00:10:14,391 --> 00:10:16,550
and just stick to the same content as the print version,

160
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,320
without effective interaction with the readers,

161
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,349
we'll only grow further apart from them.

162
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,558
You make a good point.

163
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,317
But our magazine doesn't currently have the manpower or finances

164
00:10:27,398 --> 00:10:29,468
to carry out this digital magazine upgrade.

165
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:31,882
Even if you convince the editor-in-chief,

166
00:10:31,993 --> 00:10:34,103
she'll surely ask you,

167
00:10:34,321 --> 00:10:36,401
who's going to do it, how are they going to do it,

168
00:10:36,527 --> 00:10:37,726
and where will the money come from.

169
00:10:37,855 --> 00:10:39,155
I'll do it.

170
00:10:39,433 --> 00:10:41,369
I want the highers-up to see

171
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:43,754
that I have the capability to lead the upgrade of the digital magazine.

172
00:10:43,835 --> 00:10:45,075
Then, by monetizing the content,

173
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:46,639
we can meet the manpower and financial needs

174
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,282
of the upgraded digital magazine.

175
00:10:49,289 --> 00:10:50,729
That's bold!

176
00:10:50,928 --> 00:10:53,558
Go for it. You got my full support!

177
00:11:05,673 --> 00:11:07,232
You should drop by our place more often.

178
00:11:07,313 --> 00:11:08,492
Sure, I'd be happy to.

179
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,762
- Hi, Mr. Shi.   - Hi, Mr. Shi.

180
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,940
It's cold.

181
00:11:13,021 --> 00:11:14,381
Thank you, Mr. Shi.

182
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,660
By the way,

183
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:20,400
I looked at the data and information you updated on my way here.

184
00:11:20,569 --> 00:11:22,282
- The progress is impressive.   - Yes.

185
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,350
Yes, we just finished it last night.

186
00:11:24,588 --> 00:11:26,779
Lily, please take Mr. Chen to the adjacent meeting room.

187
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,896
I'll join you in a moment.

188
00:11:27,977 --> 00:11:30,807
Okay, Mr. Shi. Mr. Chen, please come with me.

189
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,260
Mr. Shi.

190
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,722
Mr. Shi Yan, if you have any requests, please don't hesitate to ask.

191
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:50,380
After all, we have a deep relationship with Mingyu.

192
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:52,215
Over the past two years,

193
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:55,006
we've had business dealings with your father as well.

194
00:11:55,525 --> 00:11:58,642
Of course, given the circumstances at that time,

195
00:11:58,831 --> 00:12:01,181
we certainly wanted to help.

196
00:12:01,657 --> 00:12:02,977
So, I believe

197
00:12:03,118 --> 00:12:06,214
we'll have a great time working together this time.

198
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,722
Mr. Shi, do you have any questions?

199
00:12:13,655 --> 00:12:14,676
Thank you.

200
00:12:14,912 --> 00:12:16,962
I've already reviewed the situation with Lieying,

201
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:18,496
but what I'm more interested in

202
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:21,725
is the future direction your company is focusing on.

203
00:12:23,393 --> 00:12:27,982
Our company is among the top-ranking ones in the industry.

204
00:12:28,322 --> 00:12:30,845
As for Le'an Technology,

205
00:12:30,992 --> 00:12:33,372
they used to be one of our suppliers.

206
00:12:33,551 --> 00:12:35,422
This is unrelated to industry position.

207
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:38,050
According to the information,

208
00:12:38,176 --> 00:12:42,202
if your company's ultimate goal is to serve a broader public,

209
00:12:42,368 --> 00:12:45,287
there must be further technological advancement.

210
00:12:45,448 --> 00:12:47,879
However, so far, I haven't seen a solution.

211
00:12:50,096 --> 00:12:52,127
Mr. Shi, here's the thing.

212
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,830
Lieying is an established company.

213
00:12:55,105 --> 00:12:58,825
Investing in them will help us enter the industry quickly.

214
00:12:59,036 --> 00:13:02,678
Besides, Lieying has a close relationship with Mingyu.

215
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:04,496
We've been through thick and thin together.

216
00:13:04,577 --> 00:13:05,882
That's right.

217
00:13:06,072 --> 00:13:07,282
Yes, I understand.

218
00:13:07,544 --> 00:13:09,464
My father holds Lieying in high regard.

219
00:13:11,695 --> 00:13:13,976
However, business is business.

220
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,910
The essence of investment is buying future value.

221
00:13:17,177 --> 00:13:19,047
If Lieying wants to collaborate with Yunchuang,

222
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:22,522
you should present a plan to enhance your core technology.

223
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,008
After all, we are an investment company,

224
00:13:25,136 --> 00:13:26,555
not a charity.

225
00:13:26,736 --> 00:13:27,997
Wouldn't you agree?

226
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:33,749
Thank you for your valuable time today.

227
00:13:38,801 --> 00:13:41,233
Mr. Feng, please see Mr. Li off.

228
00:13:42,872 --> 00:13:43,972
Mr. Li...

229
00:13:49,348 --> 00:13:50,488
Mr. Li...

230
00:13:57,221 --> 00:13:59,882
- Mr. Li...   - Mr. Chen, this way, please.

231
00:14:06,296 --> 00:14:08,136
Technical breakthroughs take time,

232
00:14:08,266 --> 00:14:09,386
but once achieved,

233
00:14:09,547 --> 00:14:12,282
they will be a revolutionary boost for our domestic chip production.

234
00:14:12,449 --> 00:14:13,842
So, keep up the good work

235
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,039
and create our own patents.

236
00:14:16,226 --> 00:14:17,361
I have high hopes for you.

237
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,682
Yunchuang will provide you with the maximum support.

238
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,460
Thank you, Mr. Shi.

239
00:14:21,715 --> 00:14:24,193
If we can resolve the R&D funding issue,

240
00:14:24,369 --> 00:14:26,599
I'm very confident we can make significant progress.

241
00:14:26,976 --> 00:14:28,802
I'll pay another visit to Le'an tomorrow.

242
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:32,322
- We can discuss it further then.   - Okay, I should get going.

243
00:14:37,841 --> 00:14:38,902
Mr. Shi,

244
00:14:39,313 --> 00:14:40,613
I'll be straightforward.

245
00:14:41,054 --> 00:14:44,762
Lieying's owner, Mr. Li, is an old friend of your father and Mr. Tian.

246
00:14:45,026 --> 00:14:47,322
If you insist on choosing Le'an,

247
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:51,122
I'm afraid it won't be easy to convince the board.

248
00:14:51,696 --> 00:14:53,917
Meetings are a fundamental part of investments.

249
00:14:54,177 --> 00:14:57,017
If you can't even manage the meeting schedule with potential partners,

250
00:14:57,232 --> 00:14:59,332
how can I trust your judgment on the project?

251
00:14:59,852 --> 00:15:01,919
Mingyu's investments are based on future trends,

252
00:15:02,051 --> 00:15:03,635
not personal connections.

253
00:15:11,408 --> 00:15:12,548
Mr. Tian,

254
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,671
Mr. Shi suddenly came during our meeting today.

255
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,259
Hi, Mr. Shi.

256
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:26,627
(Uncle, didn't you promise to come pick me up today?)

257
00:15:26,712 --> 00:15:27,872
Something came up last minute.

258
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:30,120
(Uncle, do you not love me anymore?)

259
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,220
Mr. Shi.

260
00:15:31,482 --> 00:15:33,340
I have to go. Talk later.

261
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:35,430
I've dropped off Miss Qin.

262
00:15:35,673 --> 00:15:38,189
She's been complaining that you didn't personally pick her up

263
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,959
and asked me to convey her frustration to you.

264
00:15:40,065 --> 00:15:41,264
Is there anything else?

265
00:15:41,384 --> 00:15:44,403
Yes, Mr. Guan Ji said he hadn't been able to reach you on your phone.

266
00:15:44,712 --> 00:15:45,754
What does he want?

267
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,999
Mr. Guan Ji is hosting a dinner tonight at the Warner Estate.

268
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,030
He insists on your attendance.

269
00:15:50,197 --> 00:15:51,256
I'm busy.

270
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,319
Mr. Guan Ji anticipated you'd say that.

271
00:15:54,472 --> 00:15:57,261
He said he has an important person he'd like to introduce to you.

272
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,522
(Yu You)

273
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,070
All right, tell him I'll attend tonight.

274
00:16:13,437 --> 00:16:15,706
What about the interview with Financial Introduce this evening?

275
00:16:18,008 --> 00:16:21,174
Explain the situation to them and reschedule it.

276
00:16:21,512 --> 00:16:23,062
Understood, I'll do that right away.

277
00:16:35,292 --> 00:16:37,319
(Babe, you won't be working overtime today, right?)

278
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,660
Xing Zhou,

279
00:16:39,681 --> 00:16:43,470
do you remember the interview with Shi Yan I told you about?

280
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,639
The editor just informed me

281
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,042
that they've switched the journalist

282
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,762
for Shi Yan's interview, and it's me now.

283
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:51,482
(But we only celebrate my birthday once a year.)

284
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,014
I'm sorry, Xing Zhou.

285
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,153
I've been preparing for the interview with Shi Yan for over two months.

286
00:16:56,234 --> 00:16:58,184
It really is a rare opportunity.

287
00:16:58,385 --> 00:16:59,825
He specifically requested for me to do it.

288
00:16:59,905 --> 00:17:03,142
If I don't go, we won't have a cover story for next issue.

289
00:17:03,904 --> 00:17:07,064
You know how many stories he has.

290
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,519
He hasn't done any interviews since founding Mingyu Yunchuang until now.

291
00:17:10,665 --> 00:17:13,135
This will be his first exclusive interview.

292
00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:16,282
(Fine. I guess we can celebrate a little later.)

293
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,722
(I'll wait for you downstairs at the office after I finish work.)

294
00:17:19,337 --> 00:17:20,718
I'm sorry, Xing Zhou.

295
00:17:20,827 --> 00:17:22,127
It was so sudden.

296
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:24,402
(It's okay, I understand.)

297
00:17:24,672 --> 00:17:27,122
(You've put in so much preparation for this interview.)

298
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,629
(You have to make the most of it.)

299
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,002
Thank you, Xing Zhou.

300
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:33,412
You're the best.

301
00:17:34,401 --> 00:17:35,973
The interview starts at seven.

302
00:17:36,054 --> 00:17:37,762
I'll try to wrap it up within two hours.

303
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,039
There'll still be time for me to join you, blow out candles, make a wish,

304
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,380
and have birthday cake.

305
00:17:42,421 --> 00:17:43,971
(I'll come pick you up after you're done.)

306
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,981
I'll send you my location later.

307
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,761
You're amazing.

308
00:17:56,337 --> 00:17:58,322
So, your boyfriend is completely fine with it?

309
00:17:58,849 --> 00:18:02,149
Yes, he said he understands and even offered to pick me up.

310
00:18:03,402 --> 00:18:07,199
Your boyfriend seems overly understanding.

311
00:18:08,168 --> 00:18:10,648
Unlike mine, he's extremely possessive.

312
00:18:10,864 --> 00:18:12,399
If I were to stand him up just once,

313
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,029
no matter the reason, he'd get mad at me.

314
00:18:17,112 --> 00:18:18,172
Let's go.

315
00:18:29,528 --> 00:18:32,398
(Hello, Miss Zheng, This is Chen Sheng from Mingyu Yunchuang.)

316
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,461
Hello, Mr. Chen.

317
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,639
Miss Zheng, Mr. Shi has to cancel

318
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,399
the interview tonight due to personal reasons.

319
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,482
We will need to reschedule.

320
00:18:39,563 --> 00:18:40,602
(We are very sorry.)

321
00:18:41,857 --> 00:18:44,097
When is Mr. Shi planning to reschedule?

322
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,400
(How about the same time next week?)

323
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,660
(Or are there any convenient times for you next week?)

324
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:50,921
If we reschedule for next week,

325
00:18:51,033 --> 00:18:53,663
we won't have a cover story for the next issue of our magazine.

326
00:18:54,432 --> 00:18:57,352
Can Mr. Shi spare some time in the next two days?

327
00:18:57,552 --> 00:18:59,192
No matter how early or late.

328
00:18:59,384 --> 00:19:00,805
We can even split it into two sessions.

329
00:19:01,096 --> 00:19:02,616
I'm afraid that won't be possible.

330
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,589
(Mr. Shi's schedule for the next two days is already fully booked.)

331
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,980
Then...

332
00:19:08,705 --> 00:19:10,505
How about setting aside two hours tonight?

333
00:19:10,667 --> 00:19:12,218
Even one hour is fine.

334
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,960
Mr. Shi has a personal commitment tonight.

335
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,320
He can't free up any time.

336
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,500
(We're really sorry.)

337
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,061
Hang on...

338
00:19:28,888 --> 00:19:31,087
Shan Shan, you're beautiful and well-connected.

339
00:19:31,168 --> 00:19:33,838
Can you help me find out where Shi Yan will be tonight?

340
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:46,299
Hello.

341
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:52,099
Shi Yan?

342
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:54,102
I don't know him.

343
00:19:55,247 --> 00:19:56,838
But you're in luck.

344
00:19:57,064 --> 00:20:00,666
(I do know that Shi Yan's good friend, Guan Ji, )

345
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,320
(is hosting a private banquet at Warner Estate tonight.)

346
00:20:04,424 --> 00:20:05,744
(I reckon that most people in Jiangcheng)

347
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,886
(who have connections with Guan Capital will be attending.)

348
00:20:07,967 --> 00:20:09,717
(I'm not sure if Shi Yan will be there.)

349
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,669
I'll try my luck then.

350
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:13,962
(Wait a minute.)

351
00:20:14,192 --> 00:20:15,524
(Aren't you supposed to celebrate)

352
00:20:15,652 --> 00:20:17,442
(your boyfriend Yue Xing Zhou's birthday tonight?)

353
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,322
(You're just going to bail on him?)

354
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,769
Well, I can't bail on Shi Yan, can I?

355
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,042
(Very well.)

356
00:20:24,248 --> 00:20:26,642
(A career-driven woman is the most charming.)

357
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:30,304
Thank you for your kind words.

358
00:20:35,505 --> 00:20:37,295
Warner Estate...

359
00:20:58,696 --> 00:20:59,738
Please enjoy.

360
00:21:14,304 --> 00:21:15,564
Come see me.

361
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,040
Mr. Chen, good evening.

362
00:21:32,121 --> 00:21:33,482
I'm in Warner Estate now.

363
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,762
(Miss Zheng, how did you...)

364
00:21:37,342 --> 00:21:38,863
I'm sorry for showing up uninvited,

365
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,439
but it was a matter of urgency.

366
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:43,549
Could you please let Mr. Shi know that I can wait for him here?

367
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:46,840
I hope he can sense my sincerity

368
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,642
and spare some time for the interview.

369
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,000
Tell you what, find a place and wait first.

370
00:21:51,225 --> 00:21:53,199
I'll go talk to Mr. Shi,

371
00:21:53,331 --> 00:21:55,391
(but I can't guarantee he'll have time to meet with you.)

372
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,882
(There's a good chance you might end up coming here for nothing.)

373
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,431
Understood. Regardless, I'm very grateful to you.

374
00:22:06,322 --> 00:22:07,969
I think Guan Ji organized this banquet

375
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:10,802
just to get everyone together for a meal and some drinks.

376
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,340
It can't be that simple.

377
00:22:12,936 --> 00:22:14,255
I heard that Yu You

378
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:17,122
was specially recruited by Guan Capital from abroad.

379
00:22:17,264 --> 00:22:18,982
He's a professor at University of Finance and Economics.

380
00:22:19,063 --> 00:22:20,342
Only Guan Capital could have

381
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:21,974
the clout to hire him as a consultant.

382
00:22:22,985 --> 00:22:24,638
I saw that Shi's son is here too.

383
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,482
Shi Wen Guang's son is so unreliable.

384
00:22:26,632 --> 00:22:29,512
When Mingyu was in trouble, he went off to start his own company.

385
00:22:29,624 --> 00:22:31,394
Shi Wen Guang had no choice but to entrust

386
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:33,195
the company to his son-in-law and those outsiders.

387
00:22:33,305 --> 00:22:34,312
That's outrageous.

388
00:22:34,393 --> 00:22:36,873
From what I see, the two young men from the Guan and Shi families

389
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,080
are quite ambitious.

390
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,640
Bringing in some professor from abroad,

391
00:22:39,763 --> 00:22:42,122
they're probably planning to make some waves.

392
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,519
One is timid, and the other likes to have fun.

393
00:22:44,658 --> 00:22:46,288
What waves can they make?

394
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,880
Just puffing themselves up. Let's go.

395
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,430
Is Guan Ji running late again?

396
00:23:31,973 --> 00:23:33,360
Mr. Guan Ji said he's stuck in traffic,

397
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,002
but he'll be here in ten minutes.

398
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,500
Is there anything else?

399
00:23:43,873 --> 00:23:45,802
Miss Zheng from Financial Introduce is also here.

400
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,520
She said she's waiting for you

401
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,740
and hopes you can spare some time to do the interview tonight.

402
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:52,500
Zheng Shu Yi?

403
00:23:53,328 --> 00:23:54,937
Didn't I ask you to reschedule with her?

404
00:23:55,097 --> 00:23:56,177
I did inform her,

405
00:23:56,288 --> 00:23:58,728
but she said if the interview isn't conduct as planned,

406
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:01,092
the next issue of the magazine will be left without a cover story.

407
00:24:01,526 --> 00:24:04,707
I'm not sure how she found out about your private schedule.

408
00:24:05,891 --> 00:24:07,665
I have a meeting at Le'an Technology tomorrow,

409
00:24:07,816 --> 00:24:10,286
so I definitely won't have time for an interview tonight.

410
00:24:10,568 --> 00:24:12,879
Since she came all the way here, she probably hasn't eaten.

411
00:24:13,073 --> 00:24:15,592
Arrange some food for her and a car to take her back.

412
00:24:15,688 --> 00:24:16,808
It's not easy to get a taxi here.

413
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:17,889
Yes, Mr. Shi.

414
00:24:18,656 --> 00:24:21,042
Graduated from Harvard University on a full scholarship.

415
00:24:21,201 --> 00:24:24,894
A dual Ph.D. in economics and finance from Cambridge University!

416
00:24:25,801 --> 00:24:28,442
Soon to be the youngest professor at University of Finance and Economics.

417
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,282
What an impressive resume.

418
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:57,500
- Thank you.   - You're welcome.

419
00:24:58,117 --> 00:24:59,337
Excuse me.

420
00:24:59,488 --> 00:25:02,119
Are you Yu You, Professor Yu?

421
00:25:02,857 --> 00:25:04,482
You know me?

422
00:25:05,496 --> 00:25:08,175
I've been reading some of your papers.

423
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,683
Fintech, technology-driven financial innovation,

424
00:25:11,057 --> 00:25:12,898
it's not just impacting the macroeconomy

425
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,042
but also has the potential to bring profound changes to our everyday lives.

426
00:25:16,399 --> 00:25:18,875
I feel a close connection to this field

427
00:25:18,993 --> 00:25:20,766
because it's so relevant to our daily lives.

428
00:25:20,858 --> 00:25:24,112
That's right. That's also why I chose this research direction.

429
00:25:24,239 --> 00:25:27,760
In the past, finance and capital seemed like lofty concepts,

430
00:25:27,936 --> 00:25:29,616
but now we're exploring

431
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:33,220
how they can transform our lives to what extent.

432
00:25:34,537 --> 00:25:35,617
If I ever have the chance,

433
00:25:35,719 --> 00:25:36,919
I'd really like to return to my alma mater

434
00:25:37,022 --> 00:25:38,841
and attend some of your lectures, Professor Yu.

435
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,200
You're a graduate of University of Finance and Economics?

436
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,199
Yes, I'm currently working at Financial Introduce.

437
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,562
I'm a journalist.

438
00:25:46,488 --> 00:25:47,984
Professor Yu, may I add you on WeChat?

439
00:25:48,065 --> 00:25:49,682
- Mr. Shi.   - Of course.

440
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:51,670
- I'll scan your code.   - Okay.

441
00:25:51,776 --> 00:25:55,322
That's Zheng Shu Yi from Financial Introduce.

442
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:56,779
Done.

443
00:25:57,697 --> 00:26:00,322
Zheng Shu Yi. I'll put "journalist" on Note.

444
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,621
Thank you.

445
00:26:08,488 --> 00:26:10,002
Zheng Shu Yi?

446
00:26:10,377 --> 00:26:12,737
The winner of the annual Person of the Year interview

447
00:26:12,857 --> 00:26:13,983
is the journalist of the article

448
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,227
"Zhu Xing Guo on the Currency War,"

449
00:26:17,312 --> 00:26:18,922
Zheng Shu Yi.

450
00:26:47,096 --> 00:26:49,477
I'm so sorry. I'm late.

451
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,029
Guan Ji, it's been a while since you rode horses with me.

452
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,840
My bad.

453
00:26:55,056 --> 00:26:57,262
I heard you went to Qionghai, so I was waiting for your return.

454
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,709
Well, I'm back now.

455
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:01,430
Then I'll await you at the riding club tomorrow.

456
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,719
From what I know,

457
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:08,229
tonight's banquet isn't open to the media.

458
00:27:09,221 --> 00:27:12,267
Yes, I'm here privately to wait for an interviewee.

459
00:27:17,225 --> 00:27:19,402
Work is important, but so is your health.

460
00:27:19,606 --> 00:27:21,628
You don't look very well.

461
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:24,890
It's nothing, I'll be fine after taking a pill.

462
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:32,722
We'll go in first.

463
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:33,870
Okay.

464
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,700
I should get going.

465
00:27:50,576 --> 00:27:51,876
Let's go in.

466
00:28:05,797 --> 00:28:07,019
Mr. Shi!

467
00:28:10,194 --> 00:28:12,682
I'm sorry, Miss Zheng. Mr. Shi really doesn't have time tonight,

468
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:15,756
but I'll arrange for you to do the interview at the nearest available time.

469
00:28:16,968 --> 00:28:18,208
You haven't had dinner, right?

470
00:28:18,332 --> 00:28:19,571
Go and have something to eat first,

471
00:28:19,652 --> 00:28:21,283
and I'll arrange a car to take you home.

472
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,420
It's fine. Someone is coming to pick me up.

473
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,229
I was so close.

474
00:28:31,969 --> 00:28:34,399
At least let me see what you look like.

475
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,880
- It's been so long.   - Yes, indeed, Mr. Zhang.

476
00:28:38,096 --> 00:28:41,075
- It's been so long.   - Nice to meet you.

477
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:46,779
Mr. Wang, how have you been?

478
00:28:51,736 --> 00:28:52,776
Hello, Professor Yu.

479
00:28:52,872 --> 00:28:54,013
Welcome back to China.

480
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:55,802
Hello, Mr. Shi. Thank you.

481
00:28:57,391 --> 00:28:58,959
I read your research

482
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,492
on the impact of financial constraints

483
00:29:00,573 --> 00:29:02,902
on the financing behavior of listed companies.

484
00:29:03,442 --> 00:29:05,362
It differs from many domestic perspectives.

485
00:29:05,858 --> 00:29:07,224
That was last year's thinking.

486
00:29:07,351 --> 00:29:08,652
It got a bit lengthy.

487
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,819
My thoughts have evolved this year.

488
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,950
Embracing change is the right way.

489
00:29:13,201 --> 00:29:15,002
I'm glad that Guan Ji recruited you.

490
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,625
There should be many opportunities

491
00:29:16,743 --> 00:29:18,242
for us to seek your advice.

492
00:29:18,457 --> 00:29:19,585
Mr. Shi, you're flattering me.

493
00:29:19,789 --> 00:29:21,362
The future of Yunchuang is limitless.

494
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,180
We can learn from each other.

495
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:28,579
By the way,

496
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:32,602
a while ago, I read an article titled "Zhu Xing Guo on the Currency War."

497
00:29:32,738 --> 00:29:33,738
The viewpoints are sharp.

498
00:29:33,848 --> 00:29:36,642
The writing is both insightful and warm. It was quite inspiring.

499
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:39,697
You might want to take a look if you have time.

500
00:29:40,168 --> 00:29:42,048
I vaguely remember that article.

501
00:29:42,145 --> 00:29:43,562
It was well-written.

502
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,779
Cheers.

503
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,100
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please?

504
00:29:48,916 --> 00:29:50,396
Today, we have gathered here,

505
00:29:50,536 --> 00:29:52,856
and you are all long-standing friends of Guan Capital.

506
00:29:52,952 --> 00:29:55,552
As the year comes to a close, I've organized this appreciation banquet

507
00:29:55,719 --> 00:29:58,430
as a token of gratitude for the sincere cooperation we've shared.

508
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:02,350
At the same time, we'd like to formally introduce a new friend,

509
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,800
our strategic advisor,

510
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:07,480
Mr. Yu You, a finance professor.

511
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:15,940
Thank you.

512
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:17,519
Cheers.

513
00:30:21,809 --> 00:30:22,910
Enjoy yourselves.

514
00:30:26,482 --> 00:30:28,908
- Allow me to introduce...   - We can skip that.

515
00:30:34,297 --> 00:30:36,161
Yu You, you have no idea

516
00:30:36,304 --> 00:30:38,202
he's been eager to meet you for a long time.

517
00:30:38,393 --> 00:30:41,522
I haven't even seen him this infatuated with girls.

518
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,059
You flatter me, Mr. Shi.

519
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:46,546
All right.

520
00:30:46,658 --> 00:30:48,168
We've got this major task sorted out,

521
00:30:48,344 --> 00:30:49,922
and I've secured the great expert for you.

522
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:52,882
My dad supports us, that's for sure.

523
00:30:53,009 --> 00:30:56,758
So, the next step is to win over those old-timers at Yunchuang.

524
00:30:57,119 --> 00:30:59,082
As for your dad, do you want to...

525
00:30:59,384 --> 00:31:01,495
There's no rush, let's take it slowly.

526
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:03,352
Right.

527
00:31:03,896 --> 00:31:06,664
We can now consider ourselves three stooges...

528
00:31:06,774 --> 00:31:08,565
I'm not a stooge like you.

529
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:14,642
Right. We're like the Three Musketeers of Jiangcheng,

530
00:31:14,757 --> 00:31:16,882
unstoppable with our sharp wit.

531
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,660
Cheers.

532
00:31:46,545 --> 00:31:48,242
Xing Zhou, where are you?

533
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:50,042
(Traffic is really jammed. Give me a bit more time.)

534
00:31:50,144 --> 00:31:51,642
(I'll be there as soon as I can.)

535
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:53,879
Okay, I'll be waiting on the roadside

536
00:31:53,968 --> 00:31:55,799
so you won't have to look for me.

537
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,839
Miss Zheng, long time no see.

538
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,420
What are you doing here?

539
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:13,944
Long time indeed, Mr. Zhang.

540
00:32:14,025 --> 00:32:16,042
I'm here for an interview.

541
00:32:16,279 --> 00:32:20,320
I haven't had a chance to properly thank you

542
00:32:20,401 --> 00:32:22,482
for the fantastic article you wrote for me last time.

543
00:32:22,568 --> 00:32:24,077
How about I give you a ride?

544
00:32:24,193 --> 00:32:25,392
Mr. Zhang, you're too kind.

545
00:32:25,473 --> 00:32:26,594
It's your rich experience

546
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,162
that gives me room to shine.

547
00:32:28,265 --> 00:32:29,515
My boyfriend will be here soon.

548
00:32:29,603 --> 00:32:30,884
No need to trouble you.

549
00:32:30,989 --> 00:32:33,258
All right then, take care.

550
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,670
Miss, are you alone?

551
00:32:38,488 --> 00:32:39,998
Would you like me to give you a ride?

552
00:32:40,136 --> 00:32:42,606
It's pouring rain, and it's not easy to catch a cab.

553
00:32:43,188 --> 00:32:45,648
Thanks, but no need. My boyfriend will be here shortly.

554
00:32:45,808 --> 00:32:48,229
Why are you standing here alone if you have a boyfriend?

555
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,150
Who says having a boyfriend means you can't stand here?

556
00:32:59,417 --> 00:33:01,766
Why is Miss Zheng still here?

557
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,019
Didn't you arrange a ride for her?

558
00:33:09,645 --> 00:33:11,483
She said someone was coming to pick her up.

559
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,920
How much longer, Xing Zhou?

560
00:34:02,015 --> 00:34:03,274
I'm freezing.

561
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,910
Could it be that her ride can't make it?

562
00:34:08,064 --> 00:34:10,294
At this time, on this stretch of road,

563
00:34:10,457 --> 00:34:11,962
and with the rain,

564
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:13,802
it's difficult to get a cab.

565
00:34:14,393 --> 00:34:15,667
Get the car over.

566
00:34:20,799 --> 00:34:22,759
I know it's raining, but I'm waiting for my boyfriend.

567
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,589
That's right. I have a boyfriend. Thank you and bye.

568
00:34:34,361 --> 00:34:36,003
It can't be him, can it?

569
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,579
Drive.

570
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,989
She really was waiting for her boyfriend.

571
00:34:58,079 --> 00:34:59,400
I didn't expect that

572
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,470
she really has a boyfriend.

573
00:35:02,113 --> 00:35:04,713
I had several phone calls with her today,

574
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:07,181
and I felt like she's quite easy to get along with.

575
00:35:07,319 --> 00:35:09,598
Maybe it's because she didn't succeed in the interview today,

576
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:12,159
and there were people trying to strike up conversations with her all day,

577
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:13,722
plus the weather was so cold,

578
00:35:13,803 --> 00:35:16,592
so she was a bit impatient.

579
00:35:17,826 --> 00:35:20,509
You seem quite concerned about whether she has a boyfriend or not.

580
00:35:21,056 --> 00:35:22,075
No.

581
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,562
I just think she's very good-looking,

582
00:35:24,643 --> 00:35:26,482
and she's competent in her work.

583
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,989
It's perfectly normal for her to have a boyfriend.

584
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,361
So, you think she's good-looking

585
00:35:33,592 --> 00:35:34,720
and competent in her work?

586
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,799
Definitely. And internally, they have high hopes

587
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,198
that she will skip ranks

588
00:35:39,279 --> 00:35:40,950
and secure the position of deputy editor.

589
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:45,999
- Chen Sheng, I've noticed something.   - What is it?

590
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,720
You seem to have more talent

591
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:49,954
for being a gossip columnist than being my executive assistant.

592
00:36:09,207 --> 00:36:10,288
I'm sorry, Shu Yi.

593
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,360
It was pouring today, and the road conditions were bad.

594
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,920
I got stuck in a traffic jam just as I was arriving.

595
00:36:13,993 --> 00:36:16,373
- You must be freezing.   - I'm fine.

596
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,880
How was your birthday today?

597
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,059
Did you have a good time?

598
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,282
My girlfriend didn't even spend my birthday with me. How could I be happy?

599
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,300
I'm sorry.

600
00:36:31,007 --> 00:36:33,122
Who celebrated with you today?

601
00:36:33,562 --> 00:36:34,743
Who else could it be?

602
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,985
Xu Feng?

603
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:40,109
He even wears cologne now.

604
00:36:42,832 --> 00:36:44,920
It has a light and unique scent.

605
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,280
His taste is not bad.

606
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,653
The next time you see him,

607
00:36:47,734 --> 00:36:49,800
ask him what cologne he's using.

608
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,139
I think it would suit you too.

609
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:54,579
How did the interview go today?

610
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:57,589
Long story.

611
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,910
Let's not talk about that. It's upsetting.

612
00:37:01,189 --> 00:37:03,340
Okay, don't be upset, babe.

613
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,259
Why aren't you answering?

614
00:37:14,856 --> 00:37:16,576
I'm all yours after work.

615
00:37:16,686 --> 00:37:18,236
No work calls allowed.

616
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:21,720
Come over later.

617
00:37:21,847 --> 00:37:23,676
I'll make you a bowl of longevity noodles.

618
00:37:24,413 --> 00:37:26,000
It's fine. It's already so late,

619
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,861
and you're not feeling well. Get some rest.

620
00:37:27,942 --> 00:37:30,008
There will be plenty of chances for you to make it up to me.

621
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:32,830
Why are you so considerate?

622
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,940
Well, it's because I love you, silly.

623
00:37:52,928 --> 00:37:54,448
It's still your birthday.

624
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:55,880
Happy birthday, Xing Zhou.

625
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,179
Thank you, babe.

626
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:00,420
I'll go home now.

627
00:38:23,695 --> 00:38:25,282
Hello. What's the matter?

628
00:38:26,588 --> 00:38:27,728
What?

629
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,749
I need to inform the editor.

630
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,539
Where's my phone?

631
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,941
The hospital?

632
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:30,629
How did it end up at the hospital?

633
00:39:32,046 --> 00:39:33,305
Was it stolen?

634
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,219
I was definitely holding my phone when I got in the car.

635
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:42,589
What is Xing Zhou doing in the hospital?

636
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,659
Is he sick?

637
00:39:46,291 --> 00:39:49,281
Did he have a car accident?

638
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,870
He really is here.

639
00:40:24,392 --> 00:40:26,302
License plate with repeated digits.

640
00:40:26,945 --> 00:40:28,495
Better not mess with them.

641
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:53,800
She's probably his friend.

642
00:40:54,048 --> 00:40:56,281
It's perfectly normal to visit a friend in the hospital at night.
