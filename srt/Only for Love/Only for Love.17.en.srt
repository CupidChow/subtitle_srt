00:01:31,082 --> 00:01:36,006
(Only For Love)

2
00:01:36,087 --> 00:01:39,122
(Episode 17)

3
00:02:18,886 --> 00:02:20,042
Hungry?

4
00:02:21,326 --> 00:02:23,165
No, I'm not.

5
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,819
You keep working.

6
00:02:25,565 --> 00:02:27,065
But I'm hungry.

7
00:02:29,326 --> 00:02:30,826
What should we eat then?

8
00:02:33,845 --> 00:02:35,122
It's up to you.

9
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:50,442
What's wrong?

10
00:02:53,845 --> 00:02:55,082
Nothing.

11
00:02:57,015 --> 00:02:58,045
Let me tell you.

12
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:00,925
This restaurant is ranked number one in hot pot.

13
00:03:01,006 --> 00:03:02,406
Though the environment isn't great,

14
00:03:02,447 --> 00:03:03,685
the taste is really delicious.

15
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,002
Let's go.

16
00:03:07,366 --> 00:03:08,522
Take a seat.

17
00:03:21,007 --> 00:03:22,507
Please sit, Mr. Shi.

18
00:03:57,245 --> 00:03:58,745
Do you eat tripe?

19
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,860
Do you eat duck intestines?

20
00:04:03,992 --> 00:04:06,061
Duck blood too?

21
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,030
Brain too?

22
00:04:21,566 --> 00:04:23,066
You eat all of these?

23
00:04:23,745 --> 00:04:25,096
When I came with Shan Shan before,

24
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,962
sometimes we even had to order two portions.

25
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,520
- Take a look. - It's fine.

26
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:35,560
Let me tell you.

27
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,800
Apart from Shan Shan,

28
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,880
you're the first one who has the same taste as me.

29
00:04:38,969 --> 00:04:40,709
You love what I eat too.

30
00:04:43,806 --> 00:04:45,762
You're definitely a strange guy.

31
00:04:46,566 --> 00:04:49,082
Luckily, this strange guy has a similar taste with me.

32
00:04:49,686 --> 00:04:51,186
What did you say?

33
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,739
Nothing. I complimented you on your taste.

34
00:05:01,485 --> 00:05:03,400
- Done ordering. - Okay.

35
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,433
Can you please get us two aprons?

36
00:05:05,532 --> 00:05:07,036
- Wait a minute. - Thank you.

37
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,590
Here's my exclusive secret recipe.

38
00:05:16,405 --> 00:05:18,596
Are you sure this is edible?

39
00:05:19,055 --> 00:05:22,040
Of course. This is a special sauce combining a popular secret recipe

40
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,120
and my years of experience.

41
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,031
You'll know when you try it later.

42
00:05:34,365 --> 00:05:36,006
- Hey. - (Uncle.)

43
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,093
(Uncle, where are you?)

44
00:05:38,174 --> 00:05:40,765
- What's wrong? - (I hit someone with my car.)

45
00:05:40,845 --> 00:05:41,880
(What should I do now?)

46
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,645
(Come and save me quickly.)

47
00:05:43,725 --> 00:05:46,085
Calm down first and answer my questions.

48
00:05:46,165 --> 00:05:48,205
Where are you? Are you okay?

49
00:05:48,285 --> 00:05:50,341
Is that person badly injured? Did you call the police?

50
00:05:50,365 --> 00:05:52,102
(I'm at the University of Finance and Economics.)

51
00:05:52,126 --> 00:05:55,645
(I'm fine. That person doesn't seem to be seriously hurt either.)

52
00:05:55,725 --> 00:05:57,926
(He wouldn't let me call the police.)

53
00:05:58,006 --> 00:06:00,682
Don't worry. Tell me what happened.

54
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,492
(I went to find someone at the university.)

55
00:06:02,516 --> 00:06:03,917
(I parked my car on the roadside.)

56
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:05,926
(Suddenly, an old man started shouting.)

57
00:06:06,006 --> 00:06:08,182
(When I got out of the car, I found him lying next to my car, )

58
00:06:08,206 --> 00:06:09,962
(holding his leg and groaning.)

59
00:06:10,109 --> 00:06:11,408
(When I parked, )

60
00:06:11,488 --> 00:06:14,018
I saw no one there through the rearview mirror.

61
00:06:14,405 --> 00:06:15,687
I went to help him.

62
00:06:15,767 --> 00:06:16,880
He said he couldn't move.

63
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,550
Then, he put his leg next to my car wheel.

64
00:06:19,886 --> 00:06:22,596
He wouldn't let me go or call the police.

65
00:06:23,725 --> 00:06:26,504
It hurts me so much. My leg was broken.

66
00:06:27,686 --> 00:06:30,486
He is hugging his leg now.

67
00:06:30,566 --> 00:06:32,755
He said his leg was broken.

68
00:06:32,965 --> 00:06:34,282
(Was there any bleeding?)

69
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:37,322
No.

70
00:06:38,686 --> 00:06:40,315
He didn't let you call the police.

71
00:06:40,446 --> 00:06:41,995
Have you called an ambulance?

72
00:06:42,165 --> 00:06:43,442
(Not yet.)

73
00:06:44,006 --> 00:06:46,325
Little girl, look at me.

74
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:48,462
How come you hit me and ignore me?

75
00:06:49,886 --> 00:06:52,236
What's wrong with young people nowadays?

76
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:53,784
It hurts me so much.

77
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,762
Uncle, come quickly.

78
00:06:55,865 --> 00:06:58,120
My parents are not at Jiangcheng.

79
00:06:58,246 --> 00:07:00,755
I don't know what to do now.

80
00:07:00,886 --> 00:07:02,845
I know. Don't panic.

81
00:07:02,925 --> 00:07:05,586
Don't go near him either. Go back to your car and sit down.

82
00:07:09,326 --> 00:07:10,686
Are you leaving?

83
00:07:10,766 --> 00:07:11,846
I'll go pay the bill first.

84
00:07:11,925 --> 00:07:14,246
Is there something urgent so late at night??

85
00:07:14,326 --> 00:07:15,726
My niece is looking for me.

86
00:07:15,806 --> 00:07:17,002
Niece?

87
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,476
But you didn't eat anything.

88
00:07:24,086 --> 00:07:25,366
Something happened to my niece.

89
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:26,802
I have to go.

90
00:07:27,806 --> 00:07:29,085
What happened to her?

91
00:07:29,165 --> 00:07:30,366
I'm not sure of the details.

92
00:07:30,446 --> 00:07:31,955
But it seems like she was scammed.

93
00:07:32,045 --> 00:07:33,545
She got scammed?

94
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,590
It's okay. You go.

95
00:07:42,742 --> 00:07:45,042
I can finish the food by myself.

96
00:07:45,246 --> 00:07:46,982
No matter what they think of how strange I am,

97
00:07:47,006 --> 00:07:48,526
I can finish the food by myself.

98
00:07:48,606 --> 00:07:50,006
Then, I'll take a cab home alone.

99
00:07:50,086 --> 00:07:51,562
Don't worry, just go.

100
00:07:58,566 --> 00:08:00,596
You really can do it alone?

101
00:08:08,365 --> 00:08:10,515
Do you know the world's loneliness level?

102
00:08:11,006 --> 00:08:13,842
Eating hot pot alone is level five.

103
00:08:14,806 --> 00:08:16,205
But it's okay.

104
00:08:16,285 --> 00:08:18,205
Compared to waiting for you all night

105
00:08:18,285 --> 00:08:20,205
at Warner Estate with a menstrual pain,

106
00:08:20,285 --> 00:08:22,477
compared to standing in high heels for two hours

107
00:08:22,558 --> 00:08:24,582
during a level seven storm at Bogang Yunwan,

108
00:08:24,863 --> 00:08:27,906
or being starved while waiting for you to finish work today,

109
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:29,888
what does this matter?

110
00:08:30,686 --> 00:08:32,405
It's okay. You go.

111
00:08:32,566 --> 00:08:34,442
After all, I'm an adult with a sound mind.

112
00:08:34,534 --> 00:08:36,854
I won't get scammed sitting here eating hot pot alone.

113
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:39,642
You can go if you can bear it.

114
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,102
Keep going.

115
00:09:00,221 --> 00:09:02,282
- You're not leaving? - No, I'm not.

116
00:09:03,326 --> 00:09:04,442
Really?

117
00:09:05,424 --> 00:09:06,924
I don't want to.

118
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,962
(Chen Sheng, Qin Shi Yue was scammed by someone. Go help her.)

119
00:09:17,109 --> 00:09:19,029
I don't want to miss your wonderful performance.

120
00:09:19,086 --> 00:09:22,822
I think you are better at acting than the scammer.

121
00:09:28,645 --> 00:09:30,882
It's getting cold. Hurry up and eat.

122
00:09:40,566 --> 00:09:41,606
What are you doing?

123
00:09:41,686 --> 00:09:43,302
Are you trying to run away after hitting me?

124
00:09:43,326 --> 00:09:44,645
Everybody, help me stop her.

125
00:09:44,725 --> 00:09:45,765
I didn't.

126
00:09:45,845 --> 00:09:47,326
I just stopped normally.

127
00:09:47,406 --> 00:09:49,045
I didn't hit you at all.

128
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,326
Everyone, look at her.

129
00:09:50,406 --> 00:09:51,906
She's trying to shirk responsibility.

130
00:09:52,245 --> 00:09:53,966
I'll call an ambulance for you.

131
00:09:54,046 --> 00:09:57,195
We should call the police here to investigate.

132
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,466
I'm not going to the hospital. I don't have money to see a doctor.

133
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:02,202
What do you want then?

134
00:10:02,283 --> 00:10:04,801
If you don't go to the hospital, how can we tell where you're injured?

135
00:10:04,825 --> 00:10:07,898
Why don't you give me some money and I'll look after myself?

136
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,791
This is what they call faking an accident, right?

137
00:10:09,815 --> 00:10:11,765
He's just taking advantage of this little girl.

138
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:14,505
How can he shout so loud after being hit? He looks fine.

139
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,630
It hurts.

140
00:10:19,359 --> 00:10:22,019
Are you guys moving or not? Hurry up.

141
00:10:23,845 --> 00:10:25,636
She seems like a college girl.

142
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,920
That's it then. She's definitely going to get scammed.

143
00:10:28,001 --> 00:10:30,042
- Let's go and take a look. - Let's go.

144
00:10:36,281 --> 00:10:37,781
Qin Shi Yue?

145
00:10:43,652 --> 00:10:45,152
5,000 yuan to settle in private.

146
00:10:45,287 --> 00:10:46,336
Can't be even one penny less.

147
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,246
Otherwise, no one can leave today.

148
00:10:48,326 --> 00:10:49,726
This little girl...

149
00:10:49,806 --> 00:10:51,486
No way, you can forget it.

150
00:10:51,566 --> 00:10:52,925
You look rich.

151
00:10:53,005 --> 00:10:54,446
How can you be so heartless?

152
00:10:54,526 --> 00:10:55,726
All right, you won't pay then?

153
00:10:55,806 --> 00:10:57,805
Then, I'll call the police to arrest you.

154
00:10:57,885 --> 00:10:59,400
Let's just call the police then.

155
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,010
Let's see if they'll arrest you or me.

156
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,842
Enough. You guys stop arguing.

157
00:11:04,077 --> 00:11:05,499
If you guys want to argue, go somewhere else.

158
00:11:05,523 --> 00:11:07,813
Old man, you look all right.

159
00:11:08,022 --> 00:11:10,836
Little girl, why don't you just give him 1,000 yuan and be done with it?

160
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,280
Take this as a lesson.

161
00:11:12,361 --> 00:11:13,954
- Yeah, right. - No way.

162
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,829
Not even one penny less than 2,000 yuan.

163
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:19,282
Little girl, you'd better hurry up and give him 2,000 yuan.

164
00:11:19,365 --> 00:11:22,206
Aren't you causing a scene? Look, the road is blocked.

165
00:11:22,286 --> 00:11:23,405
Yeah.

166
00:11:23,485 --> 00:11:25,682
(But sometimes, money can't solve all problems.)

167
00:11:25,845 --> 00:11:27,045
(When judging something, )

168
00:11:27,126 --> 00:11:29,726
(you have to consider if it should be done and if it's worth it.)

169
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:34,919
This isn't even a matter of how much money.

170
00:11:35,085 --> 00:11:36,519
If it's my responsibility,

171
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,959
I'll give it whether it's 5,000 yuan or 50,000 yuan.

172
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:42,311
But if it's not my responsibility, I won't give a penny.

173
00:11:42,889 --> 00:11:45,282
My money is earned through hard work.

174
00:11:45,485 --> 00:11:48,562
My family's money is also earned through hard work.

175
00:11:48,782 --> 00:11:51,972
It shouldn't and can't be spent in the wrong way.

176
00:11:57,405 --> 00:11:58,405
It's not much money.

177
00:11:58,485 --> 00:11:59,805
- Just give it. - That is.

178
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,280
She didn't do anything wrong. Why should she give him money?

179
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:04,142
Since you think the money is little,

180
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:05,835
why don't you give him money?

181
00:12:06,206 --> 00:12:07,706
What does it have to do with me?

182
00:12:08,206 --> 00:12:10,202
The car was parked in the parking spot.

183
00:12:10,383 --> 00:12:11,876
Who was blocking the traffic?

184
00:12:11,957 --> 00:12:13,748
I think everyone should be clear.

185
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,728
There should be a driving recorder in the car.

186
00:12:17,046 --> 00:12:19,606
Old man, I can help you if you insist on calling the police.

187
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,571
When the police come and look at the driving recorder,

188
00:12:21,595 --> 00:12:23,002
everything will be clear.

189
00:12:23,286 --> 00:12:24,962
But I have to remind you.

190
00:12:25,046 --> 00:12:28,435
If it's a staged accident, it will be handled as extortion.

191
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,269
I don't understand what you're saying.

192
00:12:32,983 --> 00:12:35,282
But my feet don't hurt as much now.

193
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,405
I'm doing this for the sake of you, little girl.

194
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,450
I'm being magnanimous and letting this go.

195
00:12:40,365 --> 00:12:42,195
That old man.

196
00:12:42,926 --> 00:12:44,955
Let's go.

197
00:12:46,965 --> 00:12:49,282
Professor Yu, thank you.

198
00:12:49,605 --> 00:12:51,105
No need to thank me.

199
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,430
You just did the right thing.

200
00:12:56,557 --> 00:12:57,997
- Well... - I'll go first.

201
00:12:58,116 --> 00:13:00,556
- You should go home soon too. - Be careful.

202
00:13:00,622 --> 00:13:02,122
I...

203
00:13:03,046 --> 00:13:04,955
Then, I'll treat you to dinner next time.

204
00:13:12,365 --> 00:13:13,602
Miss Qin.

205
00:13:14,965 --> 00:13:16,242
Chen Sheng?

206
00:13:16,438 --> 00:13:17,938
Why is it you?

207
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,595
Okay, I got it.

208
00:13:24,057 --> 00:13:26,120
Uncle, where did you go?

209
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,950
Why didn't you come to pick me up just now?

210
00:13:29,206 --> 00:13:30,955
So, you solved it yourself?

211
00:13:32,286 --> 00:13:33,442
Yes.

212
00:13:35,601 --> 00:13:37,911
Thanks to a kind guy who helped.

213
00:13:38,245 --> 00:13:40,235
Then, you should thank him properly.

214
00:13:41,925 --> 00:13:44,238
Oh yeah. Who did you look for today?

215
00:13:44,725 --> 00:13:46,315
No one.

216
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:48,308
Just an ordinary friend.

217
00:13:51,143 --> 00:13:52,482
Uncle.

218
00:13:53,054 --> 00:13:54,884
Did you go for hot pot?

219
00:14:05,566 --> 00:14:08,401
Who else can make you eat hot pot except my mom?

220
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,522
It can't be my aunt, right?

221
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,660
What did you say?

222
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:18,881
You hate the strong smell.

223
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,966
You never liked hot pot before.

224
00:14:21,046 --> 00:14:22,256
But today, not only you ate it,

225
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,993
you even had Sichuan hot pot.

226
00:14:24,318 --> 00:14:27,148
Who is so important that you would accompany her to eat hot pot?

227
00:14:27,662 --> 00:14:29,853
It must be my future aunt.

228
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,821
You did really well today.

229
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,036
You must be tired, so rest early.

230
00:14:42,765 --> 00:14:44,265
It's really smelly.

231
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,860
I'm going to take a shower.

232
00:14:48,885 --> 00:14:51,595
How long has it been since Uncle touched my head?

233
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,115
Why is he suddenly so gentle?

234
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:58,642
That's not right. He didn't refute.

235
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:01,066
There must be something going on.

236
00:15:09,582 --> 00:15:10,622
Hello.

237
00:15:10,765 --> 00:15:12,126
(Yi, come sing with us.)

238
00:15:12,206 --> 00:15:14,602
(Today is Da Zhuang's birthday. We are at the karaoke.)

239
00:15:14,683 --> 00:15:16,684
I'm not going. I just got home.

240
00:15:16,774 --> 00:15:18,274
(Just got home?)

241
00:15:18,566 --> 00:15:20,045
(Did you work overtime today?)

242
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:22,305
No, I just came back after eating hot pot.

243
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,057
(With Shi Yan?)

244
00:15:26,065 --> 00:15:27,846
You always said when you were in school

245
00:15:27,926 --> 00:15:30,235
that I would definitely be the first to get married

246
00:15:30,566 --> 00:15:32,595
and you would be my bridesmaid.

247
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:36,642
All right, I won't chat with you now.

248
00:15:37,566 --> 00:15:38,682
Bye.

249
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,625
Why don't you reply to my message?

250
00:15:56,725 --> 00:15:58,475
Maybe there were too many messages

251
00:15:58,566 --> 00:16:00,066
and I didn't see yours.

252
00:16:02,645 --> 00:16:04,145
I have something to tell you.

253
00:16:05,286 --> 00:16:06,482
Shan Shan.

254
00:16:06,926 --> 00:16:09,276
What's going on? Everyone is waiting for you. Let's go.

255
00:16:13,046 --> 00:16:14,715
I said I have something to tell you.

256
00:16:16,574 --> 00:16:18,923
- What are you doing? - Da Zhuang, it's fine.

257
00:16:20,485 --> 00:16:21,842
Shan Shan.

258
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,229
I really have something to tell you.

259
00:16:28,965 --> 00:16:31,042
Guan Ji, what are you doing?

260
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:33,002
You lost the game and ran away?

261
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,715
Hurry up. Bei Bei is still waiting for you to drink.

262
00:16:42,542 --> 00:16:43,822
- Let's go in. - Let's go.

263
00:16:43,965 --> 00:16:45,006
Shan Shan.

264
00:16:45,086 --> 00:16:46,165
Let's go.

265
00:16:46,245 --> 00:16:47,762
Let's go.

266
00:16:51,245 --> 00:16:52,745
Don't look.

267
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,591
He's really a tough guy on the outside but soft on the inside.

268
00:16:57,845 --> 00:16:59,565
If he was really heartless,

269
00:16:59,662 --> 00:17:01,962
he could have pretended he didn't see it.

270
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,666
But he didn't.

271
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:09,151
Thinking about it, we really are a fateful pair.

272
00:17:12,286 --> 00:17:14,315
He helped me so much.

273
00:17:14,486 --> 00:17:16,476
I should treat him to a meal.

274
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,756
Right. I must treat him to a meal.

275
00:17:30,086 --> 00:17:31,125
(I'm home.)

276
00:17:31,205 --> 00:17:32,486
(Thanks for your help today.)

277
00:17:32,566 --> 00:17:35,206
(Your help is definitely worth a meal.)

278
00:17:35,286 --> 00:17:38,202
(When are you free so I can treat you?)

279
00:17:40,187 --> 00:17:41,384
(Okay.)

280
00:17:41,605 --> 00:17:42,726
He agreed.

281
00:17:42,806 --> 00:17:44,675
He finally agreed.

282
00:17:47,645 --> 00:17:49,726
(I remember you like the dishes from Yubaoxuan.)

283
00:17:49,806 --> 00:17:51,516
(Let's go there.)

284
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:57,625
(Why don't I pick the place?)

285
00:17:57,966 --> 00:17:59,756
(Okay, no problem.)

286
00:18:08,077 --> 00:18:09,762
Good morning, Shu Yi.

287
00:18:10,046 --> 00:18:11,402
Good morning, Yue.

288
00:18:11,696 --> 00:18:13,522
Why are you here so early today?

289
00:18:13,613 --> 00:18:15,840
Because I'm too excited to sleep.

290
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,166
So, I went to work.

291
00:18:17,246 --> 00:18:19,411
Excited? Why excited?

292
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,525
Because of what happened yesterday.

293
00:18:21,605 --> 00:18:23,105
It was so amazing.

294
00:18:24,727 --> 00:18:26,522
He should at least go and have a look.

295
00:18:26,608 --> 00:18:29,922
Otherwise, that man would bully you.

296
00:18:30,281 --> 00:18:32,522
He's not fulfilling his role as an uncle well.

297
00:18:33,093 --> 00:18:35,150
He might have been ensnared by a little enchantress.

298
00:18:35,174 --> 00:18:36,695
That would be too much.

299
00:18:36,806 --> 00:18:39,090
What could be more important than his own niece?

300
00:18:39,634 --> 00:18:40,805
In ancient times,

301
00:18:40,885 --> 00:18:44,721
he would be a misguided and infatuated king led astray by a wicked woman.

302
00:18:44,802 --> 00:18:46,351
Exactly.

303
00:18:47,911 --> 00:18:49,411
So, what happened then?

304
00:18:49,901 --> 00:18:52,821
Then, I remembered someone telling me

305
00:18:52,902 --> 00:18:54,863
that money can't solve all problems.

306
00:18:54,944 --> 00:18:57,827
So, I told that old man that my money was earned through hard work.

307
00:18:57,927 --> 00:19:00,424
If it was my responsibility, I could give him money.

308
00:19:00,553 --> 00:19:03,303
But if it wasn't my responsibility, I wouldn't give him a penny.

309
00:19:04,205 --> 00:19:06,236
Well done, Yue.

310
00:19:08,925 --> 00:19:12,986
But I feel that your story lacks a male lead.

311
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,460
You're right.

312
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,961
Although I said that,

313
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,140
the old man still wouldn't leave.

314
00:19:21,605 --> 00:19:22,765
At that moment,

315
00:19:22,845 --> 00:19:25,926
someone suddenly pushed through the crowd,

316
00:19:26,006 --> 00:19:28,757
like Monkey King stepping on a rainbow cloud,

317
00:19:28,838 --> 00:19:30,909
and suddenly appeared in front of me.

318
00:19:31,605 --> 00:19:34,663
He told the people who were trying to get me to pay

319
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,542
that if they thought the money wasn't much,

320
00:19:36,566 --> 00:19:37,782
they should just give it instead.

321
00:19:37,806 --> 00:19:39,206
Then, he wanted to call the police.

322
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:41,395
That old man got up and left.

323
00:19:41,526 --> 00:19:43,115
Then, everyone else dispersed.

324
00:19:46,566 --> 00:19:49,595
So, you like that person?

325
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,471
And, that person is interested in you too, right?

326
00:19:57,645 --> 00:19:58,962
Probably.

327
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,481
It's good if you like two like each other.

328
00:20:01,727 --> 00:20:03,006
But I'm telling you, Yue,

329
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,070
you can't let love interfere with work.

330
00:20:05,431 --> 00:20:07,030
Don't worry, Shu Yi.

331
00:20:07,111 --> 00:20:09,942
I'm going to have success in both love and work.

332
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:16,382
But your uncle was really too much.

333
00:20:16,657 --> 00:20:19,002
Fortunately, your superhero came.

334
00:20:20,806 --> 00:20:22,516
But I can't blame him.

335
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:25,624
I should blame the future aunt.

336
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,663
Shu Yi, it's cold.

337
00:20:30,782 --> 00:20:32,154
Remember to stay warm.

338
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,365
Mom, I just broke up.

339
00:20:39,445 --> 00:20:42,387
I can't start a new relationship so quickly.

340
00:20:44,566 --> 00:20:47,674
No, what if it doesn't work out and he's still a jerk?

341
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,311
I won't look at it.

342
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:52,759
If I really want to start dating,

343
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,362
there are so many high-quality men around me.

344
00:20:55,526 --> 00:20:57,682
All right, I'm hanging up. I'm working now.

345
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:01,417
What is it? Your family is forcing you to go on a blind date?

346
00:21:01,441 --> 00:21:02,762
Right.

347
00:21:05,165 --> 00:21:06,642
Why are you resisting so much?

348
00:21:06,743 --> 00:21:08,852
Are you trying to get back together with him?

349
00:21:09,095 --> 00:21:10,737
No way!

350
00:21:10,818 --> 00:21:13,488
Once unfaithful, a hundred times unforgivable.

351
00:21:14,071 --> 00:21:15,581
Then, I can rest assured.

352
00:21:16,022 --> 00:21:17,821
My mom has nothing better to do.

353
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:19,662
She found out immediately after we broke up.

354
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:20,991
My mom is the same.

355
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:23,256
A few days ago, she suddenly came over from our hometown.

356
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,451
She dragged me to meet someone. We ate and watched movies together.

357
00:21:25,475 --> 00:21:27,185
It was like a blind date package.

358
00:21:29,046 --> 00:21:30,522
Nan. Shu Yi.

359
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,125
What are you two talking about?

360
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:34,282
Blind dates.

361
00:21:34,622 --> 00:21:36,122
Blind dates?

362
00:21:37,184 --> 00:21:39,122
Shu Yi, are you going on a blind date too?

363
00:21:39,271 --> 00:21:40,402
Yeah.

364
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,970
You two talk first. The editor is looking for me.

365
00:21:45,766 --> 00:21:47,162
How is the blind date candidate?

366
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:49,540
Is he handsome? Does he have good conditions?

367
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,570
He's quite handsome.

368
00:21:53,454 --> 00:21:55,123
How does he compare to Uncle?

369
00:21:56,605 --> 00:21:58,922
Seems like he's not inferior to him.

370
00:21:59,246 --> 00:22:00,462
What about other conditions?

371
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,926
Quite good.

372
00:22:02,007 --> 00:22:03,367
He's a top student.

373
00:22:03,486 --> 00:22:04,805
A tall, rich, and handsome guy.

374
00:22:04,885 --> 00:22:06,476
A tall, smart, and handsome guy.

375
00:22:07,445 --> 00:22:09,675
It's so hard to choose, Shu Yi.

376
00:22:10,901 --> 00:22:12,611
Actually, I haven't compared.

377
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,902
Yeah.

378
00:22:14,149 --> 00:22:15,927
It's all about feelings when it comes to dating.

379
00:22:15,951 --> 00:22:18,311
Just because someone is rich doesn't mean he's good, right?

380
00:22:29,942 --> 00:22:31,242
No.

381
00:22:31,672 --> 00:22:33,602
He is still very excellent.

382
00:22:34,295 --> 00:22:36,845
Shu Yi. You have such good conditions.

383
00:22:36,925 --> 00:22:38,686
Don't make a decision too soon.

384
00:22:38,766 --> 00:22:40,166
As the saying goes,

385
00:22:40,246 --> 00:22:41,886
"you can't judge a book by its cover."

386
00:22:41,966 --> 00:22:43,720
We all have the right to make more friends.

387
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,200
You can make friends, observe them, choose the right ones,

388
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,365
and then develop the relationship further.

389
00:22:48,445 --> 00:22:51,866
Don't give up the whole forest for one tree.

390
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,581
Even in gaming, you must clear a few missions before getting to the boss.

391
00:22:54,605 --> 00:22:57,036
Take your time and pick carefully.

392
00:22:57,326 --> 00:22:58,562
Yue.

393
00:22:58,766 --> 00:23:01,764
I didn't expect you to be so enlightened in this area.

394
00:23:02,526 --> 00:23:04,602
Of course. Let's put it this way.

395
00:23:04,688 --> 00:23:07,398
Apart from work, I can say I'm not bad at anything.

396
00:23:16,504 --> 00:23:18,982
In conclusion, I think investing in Zhanlan

397
00:23:19,063 --> 00:23:21,922
isn't a good choice for Yunchuang.

398
00:23:22,752 --> 00:23:23,838
Shi Yan.

399
00:23:23,918 --> 00:23:25,813
From what you said, Jiang Shao Yuan

400
00:23:25,894 --> 00:23:27,702
is nothing more than a bit arrogant in his attitude.

401
00:23:27,726 --> 00:23:30,550
Once we invest in him, he won't be like this anymore.

402
00:23:30,711 --> 00:23:31,762
We all know

403
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:34,048
that there are so many companies interested in investing in him.

404
00:23:34,072 --> 00:23:36,022
It's normal for him to be proud.

405
00:23:36,495 --> 00:23:37,565
Shi Yan.

406
00:23:37,645 --> 00:23:39,605
You are a person with vision.

407
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:43,082
I think these details are not worth paying attention to.

408
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:46,427
You asked him so many sharp questions.

409
00:23:46,507 --> 00:23:48,982
It's understandable for him to have a bad attitude.

410
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,110
But now, so many accidents have happened.

411
00:23:51,165 --> 00:23:52,665
Since we are investing in them,

412
00:23:52,853 --> 00:23:54,442
can't we understand the truth?

413
00:23:54,685 --> 00:23:56,882
Zhanlan's prospects are very good now.

414
00:23:57,078 --> 00:23:59,518
The Evaluation Department has also issued a report.

415
00:23:59,637 --> 00:24:00,757
You wanted inspections.

416
00:24:00,845 --> 00:24:02,685
And, inspections were conducted several times.

417
00:24:02,805 --> 00:24:06,362
I just want to know what you think now.

418
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,340
I mean that

419
00:24:09,861 --> 00:24:11,142
Zhanlan is not the best choice

420
00:24:11,246 --> 00:24:14,362
for Yunchuang to enter the solid-state battery business line.

421
00:24:17,806 --> 00:24:18,922
Shi Yan.

422
00:24:19,246 --> 00:24:22,795
Can I interpret it as you haven't figured out Zhanlan yet?

423
00:24:23,445 --> 00:24:26,145
Zhanlan is now leading the industry.

424
00:24:26,286 --> 00:24:27,717
It's an industry leader.

425
00:24:27,812 --> 00:24:31,325
Where can you find a better choice than Zhanlan?

426
00:24:32,502 --> 00:24:35,042
Zhanlan's market share is indeed very high.

427
00:24:35,165 --> 00:24:37,842
But that doesn't mean their batteries are flawless.

428
00:24:37,966 --> 00:24:40,874
Of course, I'm not asking our partners to be perfect.

429
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,499
I just hope that we can all keep improving together.

430
00:24:43,925 --> 00:24:45,525
But my judgment with Yu You

431
00:24:45,605 --> 00:24:47,302
is that Zhanlan will use this round of financing

432
00:24:47,326 --> 00:24:49,486
to expand production scale.

433
00:24:49,566 --> 00:24:51,726
If the technical problems are not solved in time,

434
00:24:51,806 --> 00:24:53,565
there may be more problems later.

435
00:24:53,645 --> 00:24:56,202
The impact may be greater then.

436
00:24:56,845 --> 00:24:57,922
No.

437
00:24:58,336 --> 00:25:02,202
You were the one who suggested that we pay attention to Zhanlan.

438
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:07,998
We invested so much effort in Zhanlan based on our trust in your judgment.

439
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,469
And now, you tell us that it's not going to work now.

440
00:25:10,925 --> 00:25:12,560
Are you just joking around?

441
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,681
Mr. Zhang makes sense.

442
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,246
We must make bold assumptions but be careful to verify them.

443
00:25:16,326 --> 00:25:18,465
We can't just pretend there won't be any problems.

444
00:25:18,853 --> 00:25:20,293
I have a question.

445
00:25:20,405 --> 00:25:22,036
Everyone is so persistent now.

446
00:25:22,205 --> 00:25:25,665
If problems arise, who will be responsible?

447
00:25:36,046 --> 00:25:37,926
Mr. Shi has been inspecting Zhanlan

448
00:25:38,006 --> 00:25:39,942
while also asking me to prepare for other investments.

449
00:25:39,966 --> 00:25:42,772
We have also chosen some other teams through comparison and screening.

450
00:25:42,853 --> 00:25:44,353
We can discuss each one.

451
00:25:44,486 --> 00:25:45,842
It sounds nice.

452
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:50,019
Is any company simply comparable to Zhanlan now?

453
00:26:04,205 --> 00:26:05,915
Look. I told you.

454
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,269
If you don't invest, they won't let you off the hook.

455
00:26:09,165 --> 00:26:11,486
But if we invest and lose money,

456
00:26:11,566 --> 00:26:13,499
won't they do the same to us?

457
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:15,886
Do you still have the mood to joke around?

458
00:26:15,966 --> 00:26:17,891
Evaluation and negotiation both take time.

459
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,491
Investing in a new company might not be so fast.

460
00:26:21,526 --> 00:26:22,880
What should we do then?

461
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,600
We need to speed up.

462
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,640
We still need to make things clear about Zhanlan.

463
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,990
Would they be willing to listen to you?

464
00:26:33,806 --> 00:26:36,036
You can play chess at home.

465
00:26:36,486 --> 00:26:38,705
Why are you free to come to my place today?

466
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:41,865
You are ignoring me.

467
00:26:44,405 --> 00:26:45,905
Let me guess.

468
00:26:46,224 --> 00:26:49,563
Are Zhang and Tian bothering you again?

469
00:26:54,966 --> 00:26:56,466
Let me guess again.

470
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,236
Did Shi Yan do something?

471
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,270
This piece can't go here.

472
00:27:05,486 --> 00:27:07,196
Look at the pattern you're playing.

473
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:09,826
If you move this piece, then that area is gone, right?

474
00:27:14,877 --> 00:27:17,988
Shi Yan never voiced his opinion.

475
00:27:18,086 --> 00:27:22,956
But Tian told me that this project was initiated by him

476
00:27:23,966 --> 00:27:25,756
and also denied by him.

477
00:27:26,205 --> 00:27:30,395
The reason was because of a small accident.

478
00:27:31,165 --> 00:27:35,315
But their opinion was not only about this project.

479
00:27:36,286 --> 00:27:39,476
They felt that Shi Yan was not mature enough

480
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,726
and not respectful enough toward them.

481
00:27:41,806 --> 00:27:45,231
They still hoped that Yunchuang could be managed

482
00:27:45,312 --> 00:27:47,699
by Xiaoming's appointed people.

483
00:27:50,783 --> 00:27:52,733
These old men.

484
00:27:56,533 --> 00:27:58,344
Stop playing. Come on.

485
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,824
Look at this one. Come on.

486
00:28:04,726 --> 00:28:06,226
So early?

487
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,420
Let's look at this first.

488
00:28:10,806 --> 00:28:11,960
I've already seen it.

489
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,540
You've seen it?

490
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:16,525
However, for electric cars in the future,

491
00:28:16,605 --> 00:28:18,765
is it still necessary to have ultra-long battery life?

492
00:28:18,806 --> 00:28:21,212
If future charging infrastructure is improved

493
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,075
and there are breakthroughs in fast-charging tech,

494
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:25,565
the current lithium-ion and lithium-iron phosphate batteries

495
00:28:25,645 --> 00:28:28,137
can already meet the majority of user needs.

496
00:28:28,726 --> 00:28:30,861
A lot of research has been put into solid-state batteries

497
00:28:30,885 --> 00:28:34,026
but the future returns may be very small.

498
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,669
Are you here so early to read me a magazine?

499
00:28:40,286 --> 00:28:42,276
Shu Yi really knows how to write.

500
00:28:43,205 --> 00:28:45,334
I think she must have done a lot of research work.

501
00:28:46,046 --> 00:28:47,845
The whole article is not limited to

502
00:28:47,925 --> 00:28:50,166
whether Zhanlan is good or bad

503
00:28:50,246 --> 00:28:52,053
but it gives us a new perspective.

504
00:28:52,286 --> 00:28:55,036
Maybe solid-state batteries are not the only way out.

505
00:28:57,205 --> 00:28:59,945
When I went to Zhanlan with her, we discussed this issue.

506
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,325
All right.

507
00:29:03,405 --> 00:29:04,581
Since you have already read it,

508
00:29:04,605 --> 00:29:06,722
I'll go to the conference room and wait for you.

509
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,966
Oh yeah.

510
00:29:11,046 --> 00:29:12,581
Let's have a meal together some other day.

511
00:29:12,605 --> 00:29:14,445
We can listen to her opinion at the same time.

512
00:29:32,365 --> 00:29:33,861
Mr. Shi, everything is already arranged.

513
00:29:33,885 --> 00:29:35,385
We can start the meeting.

514
00:29:44,107 --> 00:29:45,548
You have read the article, right?

515
00:29:45,629 --> 00:29:47,739
It also comes with the recent accident investigation report

516
00:29:47,763 --> 00:29:49,042
of Hengxin Vehicles.

517
00:29:50,526 --> 00:29:51,726
Shi Yan.

518
00:29:51,806 --> 00:29:55,457
Currently, are you deciding whether to invest in a company

519
00:29:55,557 --> 00:29:57,577
by reading articles in magazines?

520
00:30:00,205 --> 00:30:02,122
I remember this journalist

521
00:30:02,388 --> 00:30:04,256
who wrote an exclusive interview for you before.

522
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,625
This wasn't a paid article, right?

523
00:30:07,421 --> 00:30:09,782
Mr. Zhang. This is Financial Introduce.

524
00:30:09,863 --> 00:30:12,486
Their year of publication is almost the same as Mingyu.

525
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,045
Paying them to write?

526
00:30:14,148 --> 00:30:16,785
You have overestimated Shi Yan, all right?

527
00:30:17,046 --> 00:30:18,835
I was just joking.

528
00:30:19,405 --> 00:30:20,646
Shi Yan.

529
00:30:20,726 --> 00:30:22,796
We all still trust you very much.

530
00:30:22,885 --> 00:30:24,675
But what do you say we should do now?

531
00:30:24,816 --> 00:30:26,725
We have read the article.

532
00:30:26,806 --> 00:30:29,436
The journalist put forward a hypothesis.

533
00:30:29,659 --> 00:30:31,369
But I think this hypothesis

534
00:30:31,885 --> 00:30:34,202
is even less reliable than solid-state batteries.

535
00:30:34,408 --> 00:30:38,746
So, what you mean is you want to give up this line of business?

536
00:30:40,584 --> 00:30:42,464
No matter if it's to meet the market's demand

537
00:30:42,545 --> 00:30:44,446
or to respond to the country's call,

538
00:30:44,536 --> 00:30:48,788
the development of safer and higher-energy batteries is a must.

539
00:30:49,231 --> 00:30:51,710
Any investment will have risks.

540
00:30:51,845 --> 00:30:55,675
And, that's the fatal attraction of an investment.

541
00:30:56,125 --> 00:30:58,996
So, Yunchuang will definitely not give up in this line of business.

542
00:31:00,405 --> 00:31:02,196
I agree with Shi Yan.

543
00:31:02,726 --> 00:31:04,912
Solid-state batteries have unlimited potential.

544
00:31:05,125 --> 00:31:07,675
Yunchuang will never give up.

545
00:31:08,804 --> 00:31:11,442
Now, our country needs more environmentally friendly batteries.

546
00:31:11,523 --> 00:31:14,203
The market needs more cost-effective batteries.

547
00:31:14,324 --> 00:31:17,111
The public needs safer high-energy batteries.

548
00:31:17,286 --> 00:31:19,845
So, the reason we invest in the solid-state battery line

549
00:31:19,925 --> 00:31:22,486
is to help companies to develop batteries

550
00:31:22,566 --> 00:31:24,155
that can meet all needs.

551
00:31:24,404 --> 00:31:26,045
But this investment has a long cycle,

552
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:28,075
so we can't rush it.

553
00:31:28,925 --> 00:31:30,805
I'll fly overseas in two days

554
00:31:30,885 --> 00:31:34,501
to visit the most advanced all-solid-state battery research laboratory

555
00:31:34,582 --> 00:31:35,691
to inspect and learn.

556
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,901
Every department will also get the results of my inspection

557
00:31:37,925 --> 00:31:40,996
to choose a project that's more suitable for Yunchuang.

558
00:31:47,726 --> 00:31:49,480
The editor-in-chief purposely called

559
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,322
to praise you for the well-written article.

560
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:53,416
He also asked about the special feature about Yunchuang.

561
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,940
When will it be out?

562
00:31:55,495 --> 00:31:56,802
Very soon.

563
00:31:57,575 --> 00:32:00,255
The editor-in-chief also gave a suggestion for you to consider,

564
00:32:00,405 --> 00:32:03,407
that is, whether the special feature should be made paid-to-read.

565
00:32:04,766 --> 00:32:06,266
Can I do that?

566
00:32:06,598 --> 00:32:08,264
The editor-in-chief is really keeping up with the times.

567
00:32:08,288 --> 00:32:09,853
This proposal is so great.

568
00:32:11,165 --> 00:32:12,605
You have to do it well.

569
00:32:12,685 --> 00:32:14,406
If this attempt succeeds,

570
00:32:14,486 --> 00:32:17,122
the editor-in-chief will definitely reconsider

571
00:32:17,247 --> 00:32:18,648
the independent digital magazine.

572
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,522
It may be self-financed after all.

573
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,430
All right. Thanks, Ms. Yi.

574
00:32:42,343 --> 00:32:44,263
(I feel that Xiaguang Temple is very spiritual.)

575
00:32:46,445 --> 00:32:49,905
(Something I have been trying hard for finally made some progress.)

576
00:32:50,806 --> 00:32:52,675
(Weren't you asking for marriage?)

577
00:32:55,841 --> 00:32:58,722
(That's why you bring me good luck.)

578
00:32:59,181 --> 00:33:00,762
(The editor-in-chief said the special feature of Yunchuang)

579
00:33:00,786 --> 00:33:02,301
(can be made paid-to-read.)

580
00:33:03,925 --> 00:33:05,805
This article came just in time.

581
00:33:05,885 --> 00:33:08,220
Uncle Tian and Mr. Zhang didn't say anything.

582
00:33:08,306 --> 00:33:10,086
Yeah. The article written by Shu Yi

583
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,019
is profound yet easy to understand, and the views are sharp.

584
00:33:12,043 --> 00:33:13,543
Indeed, it has great insights.

585
00:33:29,955 --> 00:33:32,439
Everyone, what are your plans for Friday?

586
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,893
I've invited some single friends.

587
00:33:33,974 --> 00:33:35,659
Do you want to celebrate New Year's Eve together?

588
00:33:35,683 --> 00:33:38,109
On New Year's Eve, I'm going to accompany the most important people.

589
00:33:38,133 --> 00:33:41,495
My grandpa, dad, mom, uncle, and some of my friends.

590
00:33:42,246 --> 00:33:44,036
Forget it. What about you?

591
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,789
I've been too busy lately. I haven't had time to think.

592
00:33:47,053 --> 00:33:49,543
You'd better think about it. There's not much time left.

593
00:33:49,677 --> 00:33:52,438
Don't be alone on New Year's Eve.

594
00:33:52,564 --> 00:33:53,842
Got it.

595
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,282
(Mr. Shi, what's your plan for Friday?)

596
00:34:17,046 --> 00:34:19,755
(Let's go camping and watch the stars on New Year's Eve.)

597
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:25,610
(I'm going on a business trip tomorrow.)

598
00:34:30,086 --> 00:34:31,586
(Wait for me to come back.)

599
00:34:34,645 --> 00:34:35,962
(Okay.)

600
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,471
Shu Yi, have you made plans with someone?

601
00:34:42,882 --> 00:34:44,122
No.

602
00:34:44,512 --> 00:34:45,517
It's okay.

603
00:34:45,645 --> 00:34:47,962
Our family's gathering is held at night.

604
00:34:48,062 --> 00:34:49,793
I can accompany you shopping during the day.

605
00:34:49,817 --> 00:34:52,202
And, you can come with me at night.

606
00:34:53,211 --> 00:34:55,451
No need. It's enough if you accompany me during the day.

607
00:34:56,366 --> 00:34:57,602
All right then.

608
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,180
(Departed?)

609
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,984
(Yes.)

610
00:35:24,783 --> 00:35:27,177
(We can't watch the stars on New Year's Eve.)

611
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,989
(Let's watch them now.)

612
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:34,506
(I miss you.)

613
00:35:41,058 --> 00:35:42,558
(I miss you too.)

614
00:35:43,125 --> 00:35:44,625
(Did you see it?)

615
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,660
(All the best.)

616
00:35:53,482 --> 00:35:59,882
(Happy New Year)

617
00:36:01,672 --> 00:36:03,722
It's a big holiday.

618
00:36:03,783 --> 00:36:06,482
It's understandable that Shu Yi doesn't have a date.

619
00:36:06,601 --> 00:36:09,644
Yue, how come you don't have a partner?

620
00:36:09,725 --> 00:36:11,442
That's too unscientific, right?

621
00:36:11,814 --> 00:36:13,533
It's like you have a partner.

622
00:36:13,645 --> 00:36:15,454
Aren't you shopping with us now?

623
00:36:16,006 --> 00:36:17,440
Besties stay together.

624
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,520
Whoever gets into a relationship first is a puppy.

625
00:36:19,605 --> 00:36:21,671
I don't want to. But, you don't have anyone.

626
00:36:21,751 --> 00:36:24,045
- Who's the puppy? - How did you know?

627
00:36:24,125 --> 00:36:26,762
I'd like to spend the holiday with someone too.

628
00:36:29,244 --> 00:36:31,842
Tell me about it. What kind of man?

629
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:33,639
Let me give you some tips.

630
00:36:33,789 --> 00:36:35,380
I guarantee you will get him.

631
00:36:35,645 --> 00:36:36,846
Really?

632
00:36:36,966 --> 00:36:38,446
Shan Shan, tell me quickly.

633
00:36:38,526 --> 00:36:39,802
Tell me.

634
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:04,082
I understand.

635
00:37:07,031 --> 00:37:09,111
Shu Yi, let's go take a look at that clothing store.

636
00:37:18,383 --> 00:37:20,783
(Have you gotten up? Do you have time tonight?)

637
00:37:20,894 --> 00:37:23,294
(Are you meeting someone tonight? Let's celebrate together.)

638
00:37:45,494 --> 00:37:46,894
Shu Yi. Shan Shan.

639
00:37:47,006 --> 00:37:48,245
You guys go back first.

640
00:37:48,325 --> 00:37:50,940
I didn't buy anything today. I'll go take a look again.

641
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:52,445
Okay. Go ahead then.

642
00:37:52,526 --> 00:37:54,085
We'll go back first. Happy New Year.

643
00:37:54,165 --> 00:37:55,800
- Happy New Year. - Happy New Year.

644
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,495
Good luck in conquering your loved one.

645
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,540
- Let's go. - Let's go.

646
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,665
Professor Yu.

647
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:21,350
Miss Qin, what a coincidence.

648
00:38:21,446 --> 00:38:22,486
Yeah, what a coincidence.

649
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:24,000
Are you here to buy something?

650
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,202
Yes.

651
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,300
Are you alone?

652
00:38:28,245 --> 00:38:29,725
My cousin is getting married soon,

653
00:38:29,806 --> 00:38:31,726
so I was thinking of getting her a wedding gift.

654
00:38:32,566 --> 00:38:34,066
Haven't bought it yet?

655
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,886
Not yet.

656
00:38:35,966 --> 00:38:38,825
I don't usually go to shopping malls, so I haven't picked one out yet.

657
00:38:39,165 --> 00:38:40,212
I'll help you pick.

658
00:38:40,293 --> 00:38:41,966
I'm very familiar with this mall.

659
00:38:42,046 --> 00:38:43,675
Just tell me what you need.

660
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:51,950
Okay, thank you.

661
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,130
I'll help you carry it.

662
00:38:59,245 --> 00:39:00,745
That's so kind of you.

663
00:39:04,006 --> 00:39:05,406
What's wrong?

664
00:39:05,486 --> 00:39:07,979
Can you help me to carry something else?

665
00:39:08,406 --> 00:39:09,762
What is it?

666
00:39:10,486 --> 00:39:11,642
My hand.

667
00:39:28,794 --> 00:39:31,233
Take this one. The scent of lily.

668
00:39:31,757 --> 00:39:34,588
Lily symbolizes the return of happiness.

669
00:39:34,676 --> 00:39:36,176
What a nice message.

670
00:39:36,526 --> 00:39:38,705
Sure. This one, then.

671
00:39:41,285 --> 00:39:42,482
Hello.

672
00:39:48,086 --> 00:39:50,085
This is our New Year's special event for couples.

673
00:39:50,165 --> 00:39:53,446
If you spend at least 399 yuan, you can draw for this couple mug.

674
00:39:53,526 --> 00:39:55,906
Handsome guy and pretty girl, do you guys want to join?

675
00:39:56,006 --> 00:39:57,322
- No need. - Okay.

676
00:39:59,464 --> 00:40:02,335
It's so cute. I want it.

677
00:40:03,406 --> 00:40:04,562
This...

678
00:40:07,854 --> 00:40:10,602
Hello, we should have spent enough for one chance.

679
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,300
You can draw it here.

680
00:40:12,725 --> 00:40:15,442
Pretty girl, your boyfriend really spoils you.

681
00:40:25,254 --> 00:40:27,395
Here you go. One for each of us.

682
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:30,669
If you like it, keep them all.

683
00:40:30,796 --> 00:40:33,515
Take it as a thank-you gift for helping me today.

684
00:40:36,805 --> 00:40:40,195
So, it was to thank me for helping you to buy things.

685
00:40:40,725 --> 00:40:42,205
Well then.

686
00:40:42,308 --> 00:40:43,859
Treat me to a meal.

687
00:40:45,096 --> 00:40:46,736
I have to rush to the train station soon.

688
00:40:46,828 --> 00:40:48,539
There really isn't enough time today.

689
00:40:49,886 --> 00:40:51,242
All right then.

690
00:40:51,526 --> 00:40:53,476
Let's talk about it when you get back.

691
00:40:55,406 --> 00:40:56,682
Let's go.

692
00:41:01,886 --> 00:41:05,195
When will we be able to eat together?

693
00:41:11,086 --> 00:41:14,195
It's been so long since we had a hot pot at home.

694
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,309
Last time, I remember...

695
00:41:17,605 --> 00:41:18,922
What happened?

696
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:21,002
Shi Yan.

697
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,082
Didn't I tell you Shi Yan went abroad?

698
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,400
I had everything arranged.

699
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,602
But it just so happened that he went abroad during New Year's Eve.

700
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,180
He's not abroad.

701
00:41:31,446 --> 00:41:32,722
He is there.

702
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:55,830
Shan Shan.

703
00:41:56,285 --> 00:41:58,085
My friend has been looking for me all day.

704
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,160
Now, you have someone to accompany you. I can finally go and accompany him.

705
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,882
I can be at ease if you have someone to accompany you.

706
00:42:04,165 --> 00:42:05,675
Have a good night.

707
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,962
Bye.

708
00:42:26,582 --> 00:42:29,602
Didn't you say you won't be back until next week?
