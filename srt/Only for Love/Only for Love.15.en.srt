00:01:31,202 --> 00:01:36,081
(Only For Love)

2
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:38,962
(Episode 15)

3
00:01:47,015 --> 00:01:48,435
What are you doing?

4
00:01:49,061 --> 00:01:50,890
I'm taking a cab to my hotel.

5
00:01:51,285 --> 00:01:52,762
This is your hotel.

6
00:01:52,854 --> 00:01:55,371
Zhanlan is nearby, so I booked a room here.

7
00:01:55,452 --> 00:01:57,295
You also need to go to Zhanlan and do some follow-up interviews,

8
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,739
so you're staying here with me.

9
00:01:59,797 --> 00:02:01,217
Staying with you?

10
00:02:02,262 --> 00:02:03,501
What's wrong?

11
00:02:03,612 --> 00:02:05,032
Don't you want to?

12
00:02:29,397 --> 00:02:32,292
(If I refuse, would I seem pretentious?)

13
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,110
(If I don't refuse, what does this make us?)

14
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,030
Mr. Shi, this doesn't feel appropriate.

15
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,042
What's not appropriate?

16
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,962
Hello, your luggage has been delivered.

17
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:26,488
Go on,

18
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,003
what's not appropriate?

19
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,189
It's not appropriate for you to hold my card.

20
00:03:52,596 --> 00:03:53,722
Shan Shan,

21
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:55,235
I was in the car just now.

22
00:03:55,316 --> 00:03:56,956
Shi Yan was sitting right next to me.

23
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:58,706
(And he heard everything you said.)

24
00:03:59,101 --> 00:04:00,457
He heard me? That's perfect.

25
00:04:00,538 --> 00:04:01,698
It's a good push for him.

26
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,720
(Don't tell me he still hasn't made any move after hearing what I said?)

27
00:04:05,117 --> 00:04:07,187
Well, not exactly.

28
00:04:07,358 --> 00:04:09,709
(I'm actually in the hotel where he's staying...)

29
00:04:09,872 --> 00:04:11,852
Then why are you still calling me?

30
00:04:12,957 --> 00:04:14,747
I'm in the room across from his.

31
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,875
Shi Yan is incapable.

32
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:22,329
That's nonsense.

33
00:04:23,976 --> 00:04:25,682
Did something happen between you now?

34
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,412
(Don't you know that traveling is the best chance)

35
00:04:34,436 --> 00:04:35,893
(for a man and a woman to foster a relationship?)

36
00:04:35,917 --> 00:04:37,676
You have to seize this opportunity.

37
00:04:37,756 --> 00:04:38,757
I have to go.

38
00:04:38,837 --> 00:04:40,706
I have an interview tomorrow. Bye.

39
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,460
He's okay.

40
00:04:53,516 --> 00:04:55,482
Professor Yu, you got a parcel.

41
00:04:55,917 --> 00:04:57,337
Thanks.

42
00:05:21,677 --> 00:05:23,097
(Who are these from?)

43
00:05:27,996 --> 00:05:30,716
(After a thorough investigation and testing by our technical team, )

44
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,011
(it has been determined that the accident was not)

45
00:05:33,035 --> 00:05:35,075
(directly related to the battery's quality itself.)

46
00:05:35,527 --> 00:05:38,442
(Zhanlan's batteries have consistently maintained high-quality control.)

47
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,386
(So, we'd like to reassure all car owners, you can drive without worries.)

48
00:05:43,608 --> 00:05:45,216
They're in such a rush to do damage control

49
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,122
without releasing the investigation results.

50
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,328
I can't help but feeling things aren't as simple as they seem.

51
00:06:16,769 --> 00:06:19,562
(Can you send me your upcoming work schedule?)

52
00:06:26,608 --> 00:06:28,157
She's shy.

53
00:06:34,992 --> 00:06:37,242
The day after tomorrow, Zhanlan.

54
00:06:40,976 --> 00:06:42,601
- Hello. - (Hello, Miss Zheng.)

55
00:06:42,682 --> 00:06:44,048
(I'm Mr. Jiang's secretary.)

56
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,608
(I'm calling to confirm the interview time with you.)

57
00:06:46,757 --> 00:06:48,962
(When will you be coming to the company tomorrow?)

58
00:06:49,043 --> 00:06:50,483
(I will arrange for your reception.)

59
00:06:50,885 --> 00:06:52,305
I'm already in...

60
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,519
Sorry about that.

61
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,202
Something has come up for me tomorrow.

62
00:06:55,776 --> 00:06:57,904
Can we reschedule the interview for the day after tomorrow?

63
00:06:57,928 --> 00:07:00,638
(Just a moment. Let me check Mr. Jiang's schedule.)

64
00:07:03,138 --> 00:07:06,612
(That's fine. We'll reschedule for the day after tomorrow at 10 am.)

65
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:08,962
- Is that okay? - Yes, thank you.

66
00:07:15,847 --> 00:07:18,048
(Tomorrow morning, we'll review the business contract.)

67
00:07:18,128 --> 00:07:20,767
(After lunch, we can get to know Zhanlan)

68
00:07:20,847 --> 00:07:22,642
(and explore the city it's located in.

69
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,860
(Okay.)

70
00:07:31,865 --> 00:07:33,285
(See you in the afternoon.)

71
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:36,316
(Have an early night. Good night.)

72
00:07:38,857 --> 00:07:40,277
(Good night.)

73
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,002
Here.

74
00:07:49,513 --> 00:07:51,723
So, what kind of relationship trouble do you have?

75
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,873
I've known you for so long,

76
00:07:54,991 --> 00:07:57,033
and you've never once invited me out for a drink.

77
00:07:57,168 --> 00:07:58,768
If you're asking me out and not Shi Yan,

78
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,067
it can only mean you have some relationship issues.

79
00:08:03,354 --> 00:08:04,774
I'll cut to the chase then.

80
00:08:05,328 --> 00:08:06,728
I want to know how to reject a girl

81
00:08:06,767 --> 00:08:09,627
without hurting her feelings.

82
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,282
If you're thinking of rejecting her,

83
00:08:12,473 --> 00:08:14,393
yet you're concerned about hurting her feelings?

84
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,468
Are you sure you don't like her?

85
00:08:17,106 --> 00:08:18,387
It's not what you think.

86
00:08:18,944 --> 00:08:20,224
Then what is it?

87
00:08:20,881 --> 00:08:22,362
I think the girl probably sees it

88
00:08:22,525 --> 00:08:24,682
as a fun and exciting thing.

89
00:08:24,768 --> 00:08:26,188
That's why...

90
00:08:28,248 --> 00:08:30,682
She's so involved in this "game".

91
00:08:30,967 --> 00:08:32,567
She might not be serious,

92
00:08:32,647 --> 00:08:33,928
just caught up in the moment.

93
00:08:34,074 --> 00:08:35,368
Most importantly,

94
00:08:35,506 --> 00:08:37,639
I don't think we're compatible.

95
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,580
A game?

96
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,082
What does "compatible" mean to you?

97
00:08:44,014 --> 00:08:45,242
Bottoms up!

98
00:08:47,167 --> 00:08:48,727
Keep drinking!

99
00:08:48,807 --> 00:08:49,888
Don't stop!

100
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,860
- Go on! - Come on!

101
00:08:54,357 --> 00:08:55,784
So, what should I do

102
00:08:55,865 --> 00:08:58,152
to extricate myself from this "game"?

103
00:08:58,368 --> 00:08:59,608
After everything you just said,

104
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,200
the truth is, you've actually stopped seeing this as just a game.

105
00:09:02,224 --> 00:09:04,404
Since you think she's treating you as a game,

106
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,800
why worry about not hurting her?

107
00:09:10,065 --> 00:09:13,593
Between men and women, if things could drag on for so long,

108
00:09:13,809 --> 00:09:15,649
it's unlikely that only one party has feelings

109
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,400
while the other doesn't.

110
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:23,522
If you're not interested, just reject her.

111
00:09:24,056 --> 00:09:25,912
That's the only way to truly avoid causing harm.

112
00:09:25,936 --> 00:09:27,486
Otherwise, you're just leading her on.

113
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,162
What's wrong?

114
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:39,867
Don't you have classes tomorrow?

115
00:09:40,244 --> 00:09:41,269
You should go home.

116
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,162
All right. I'll leave first. Don't stay up too late.

117
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,303
You lost again.

118
00:09:51,384 --> 00:09:53,774
Drink!

119
00:09:56,648 --> 00:09:57,729
Who is this guy?

120
00:09:57,848 --> 00:09:59,248
I don't know.

121
00:09:59,328 --> 00:10:00,368
What is he doing?

122
00:10:00,448 --> 00:10:02,362
Who is this?

123
00:10:03,088 --> 00:10:05,508
- I don't know him. - I don't know him either.

124
00:10:08,321 --> 00:10:10,842
Hi, I'm Shan Shan's friend.

125
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,413
- You should join us. - Take my seat.

126
00:10:14,807 --> 00:10:15,959
- Thanks. - Sit down, man.

127
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,242
Sit.

128
00:10:19,848 --> 00:10:22,762
- Let's carry on then. - Again.

129
00:10:24,448 --> 00:10:26,122
You lost again, Shan Shan!

130
00:10:26,182 --> 00:10:27,322
You lost again. Drink.

131
00:10:27,432 --> 00:10:28,832
I'll drink.

132
00:10:30,353 --> 00:10:32,233
Shan Shan is already drunk. I'll drink for her.

133
00:10:32,287 --> 00:10:35,238
Are you playing a knight and saving a damsel in distress now?

134
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,503
- You have to drink double if you want to help her. - That's right.

135
00:10:37,527 --> 00:10:40,442
- That's right. You will have to drink double. - Double.

136
00:10:40,613 --> 00:10:42,033
No problem.

137
00:10:43,161 --> 00:10:44,581
Let's play again.

138
00:10:44,927 --> 00:10:46,347
Come on.

139
00:10:46,807 --> 00:10:47,967
I'm done playing.

140
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,280
It's not fun.

141
00:10:49,368 --> 00:10:51,807
Shan Shan, you're being a buzzkill.

142
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,329
Weren't you the one who said you were in a bad mood and invited us here?

143
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:55,773
It's my bad.

144
00:10:57,047 --> 00:10:59,740
I'll empty this glass as an apology.

145
00:11:00,167 --> 00:11:01,587
You...

146
00:11:46,793 --> 00:11:48,213
Guan Ji?

147
00:11:53,407 --> 00:11:54,827
Guan Ji?

148
00:12:01,201 --> 00:12:02,602
Room service.

149
00:12:04,608 --> 00:12:07,207
Miss Bi, Mr. Guan had to leave earlier for some business.

150
00:12:07,287 --> 00:12:09,762
This is the breakfast he asked us to prepare for you.

151
00:12:09,848 --> 00:12:11,487
There are Chinese and Western options.

152
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,599
Mr. Guan also instructed us to bring you

153
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,800
yogurt and mulberry juice to help with your hangover.

154
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,880
And here's a change of clothes

155
00:12:18,048 --> 00:12:19,722
that Mr. Guan just delivered.

156
00:12:19,825 --> 00:12:22,213
If you need anything, please let us know.

157
00:12:23,647 --> 00:12:25,242
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

158
00:13:02,696 --> 00:13:04,407
You look nice in black.

159
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:06,802
I like you in black.

160
00:14:10,673 --> 00:14:12,184
(I have things to attend to in the morning.)

161
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:13,482
(Come see me when you wake up.)

162
00:14:18,687 --> 00:14:20,317
Are we here to learn more about Zhanlan?

163
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,207
That's right. Jiang Shao Yuan, the head of Zhanlan, is a native of Ancheng

164
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:27,421
and a well-known local entrepreneur.

165
00:14:27,502 --> 00:14:29,334
He has frequently mentioned

166
00:14:29,415 --> 00:14:30,575
the bustling Xiaguang Temple,

167
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,135
which draws crowds of visitors.

168
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,613
Ten years ago, Mr. Jiang returned to his hometown to establish Zhanlan.

169
00:14:34,637 --> 00:14:36,727
Since then, he has expanded and strengthened the company,

170
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:38,191
contributing to the local economy.

171
00:14:38,271 --> 00:14:39,885
Whenever he gets the chance,

172
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:42,042
he talks about the natural beauty of his hometown

173
00:14:42,167 --> 00:14:44,159
and encourages tourists to come to Ancheng.

174
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,282
So, to understand Zhanlan, you have to first understand Jiang Shao Yuan.

175
00:14:47,377 --> 00:14:48,656
And to understand Jiang Shao Yuan,

176
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,280
how can you not visit Xiaguang Temple, which he often recommends?

177
00:14:53,786 --> 00:14:55,346
What's wrong, Mr. Shi?

178
00:14:57,049 --> 00:14:58,609
You did your homework last night, huh?

179
00:14:58,743 --> 00:15:00,503
Did you spend a lot of time memorizing that?

180
00:15:02,328 --> 00:15:04,712
As journalists, it's important to have substantiated information.

181
00:15:04,736 --> 00:15:07,282
Naturally, we have to do our homework before speaking.

182
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:26,179
Watch your step.

183
00:15:26,671 --> 00:15:29,306
If you fall, we won't get to learn more about Mr. Jiang today.

184
00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:31,047
All your homework would be in vain.

185
00:15:31,767 --> 00:15:33,277
I won't fall.

186
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,920
I'll send you the photos later.

187
00:16:27,047 --> 00:16:28,122
Okay.

188
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,140
Hey, handsome and beautiful,

189
00:16:32,337 --> 00:16:34,882
you two have such high levels of attractiveness.

190
00:16:35,032 --> 00:16:38,835
You're the most well-matched couple I've seen today.

191
00:16:42,273 --> 00:16:44,482
- We're not... - May I help you?

192
00:16:44,715 --> 00:16:45,931
You might not know,

193
00:16:46,058 --> 00:16:49,362
but today is the last day Xiaguang Temple is open to the public.

194
00:16:49,548 --> 00:16:53,122
It'll be closed for six months starting tomorrow.

195
00:16:53,431 --> 00:16:55,282
You two really lucked out.

196
00:16:55,412 --> 00:16:57,008
It's such a rare opportunity. How about

197
00:16:57,146 --> 00:16:59,534
I take a photo of you as a keepsake?

198
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,976
No wonder there are so many people here today.

199
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,591
We really got lucky.

200
00:17:03,962 --> 00:17:05,382
Do you want to take a photo?

201
00:17:07,287 --> 00:17:08,413
It's my first time here,

202
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:10,762
and I don't know when I'll be back.

203
00:17:10,984 --> 00:17:13,265
Taking a picture for a keepsake sounds meaningful, right?

204
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,122
Yes, exactly.

205
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,788
This way, please.

206
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,242
This has the best view.

207
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,740
Come.

208
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:32,828
Guys, let's act more natural and intimate.

209
00:17:33,641 --> 00:17:36,282
Beautiful, stand closer to handsome.

210
00:17:39,827 --> 00:17:41,328
Closer, please.

211
00:17:41,502 --> 00:17:43,173
And sweeter.

212
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,082
Don't look so serious, handsome.

213
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,700
Cheer up.

214
00:18:01,829 --> 00:18:03,362
You have such a nice smile, handsome.

215
00:18:03,504 --> 00:18:05,162
Beautiful, smile more too.

216
00:18:05,363 --> 00:18:07,122
There you go. Yes.

217
00:18:08,692 --> 00:18:10,807
One, two, three.

218
00:18:13,648 --> 00:18:14,873
This is a nice one.

219
00:18:14,954 --> 00:18:16,202
You look so sweet.

220
00:18:16,289 --> 00:18:18,242
How do you put it again?

221
00:18:18,624 --> 00:18:20,162
You make a great match.

222
00:18:20,658 --> 00:18:22,242
Take a look at it.

223
00:18:24,616 --> 00:18:26,082
Thank you. It looks really nice.

224
00:18:26,264 --> 00:18:28,082
You're welcome. I'm glad you like it.

225
00:18:28,264 --> 00:18:30,104
99 yuan for two photos.

226
00:18:30,257 --> 00:18:31,537
Add me on WeChat, and transfer me the money.

227
00:18:31,561 --> 00:18:32,922
I'll send you the photos.

228
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,322
That's so expensive.

229
00:18:34,441 --> 00:18:37,122
Miss, that's the couple package price.

230
00:18:37,272 --> 00:18:38,579
What's the regular price then?

231
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,886
The regular price is 50 yuan per photo.

232
00:18:42,527 --> 00:18:45,002
How cheap. It's discounted by one yuan.

233
00:18:45,464 --> 00:18:47,482
Ninety-nine is a auspicious number.

234
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,480
Wishing you both a long and happy relationship.

235
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,848
I'll edit the photos and send them to you.

236
00:18:56,037 --> 00:18:58,602
As an extra, I'll also give you a guide.

237
00:18:58,961 --> 00:19:00,696
There's a place over there for fortune-telling.

238
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,642
Couples love going there.

239
00:19:02,723 --> 00:19:04,020
Go there and have your fortune read.

240
00:19:04,044 --> 00:19:06,122
May you have a long and happy life together.

241
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,002
Enjoy your visit.

242
00:19:10,328 --> 00:19:11,842
Hey, handsome and beautiful,

243
00:19:12,009 --> 00:19:14,072
you two have such high levels of attractiveness.

244
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,962
You're the most well-matched couple I've seen today.

245
00:19:17,728 --> 00:19:19,487
The lines are exactly the same.

246
00:19:19,574 --> 00:19:21,282
He calls everyone handsome and beautiful.

247
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,243
We really can draw fortune stick here.

248
00:20:12,065 --> 00:20:13,642
It's good fortune.

249
00:20:14,784 --> 00:20:16,979
The God of Matchmaker might have played tricks with them,

250
00:20:17,003 --> 00:20:19,233
but the lovers are already deeply in love.

251
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:21,348
What does this mean?

252
00:20:22,828 --> 00:20:25,402
Anyone who wants to have your fortune read, please come here.

253
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:33,322
Sir, what does my fortune stick mean?

254
00:20:34,464 --> 00:20:36,842
Miss, you've drawn a "great blessing" stick.

255
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:38,922
This is a great blessing.

256
00:20:39,345 --> 00:20:43,082
However, this means that you started off your relationship wrong,

257
00:20:43,221 --> 00:20:45,071
with some twists and turns.

258
00:20:45,257 --> 00:20:46,752
I thought it was a good fortune stick?

259
00:20:46,776 --> 00:20:48,082
Don't worry.

260
00:20:48,169 --> 00:20:51,057
Despite you started it off wrong, your match has shown up.

261
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,727
You have found your destined love.

262
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:56,802
You must be wholeheartedly committed to him.

263
00:20:56,943 --> 00:21:00,562
You two are a match made in heaven.

264
00:21:02,752 --> 00:21:05,002
(So, I'm deeply in love, )

265
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,922
(but I didn't realize it.)

266
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,522
(God of Matchmaker did play a trick on me.)

267
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,722
(Shi Yan is Qin Le Zhi's uncle.)

268
00:21:13,328 --> 00:21:15,328
(But it says "lovers are already deeply in love,")

269
00:21:15,363 --> 00:21:18,042
(does that mean he is already...)

270
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,020
Thank you.

271
00:21:22,425 --> 00:21:24,621
Thank you very much, sir. I hope what you said would come true.

272
00:21:24,645 --> 00:21:26,065
Goodbye.

273
00:21:30,099 --> 00:21:31,762
Do you really believe in this?

274
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,242
Why not?

275
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:36,017
A match made in heaven, what more could I ask for?

276
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,762
Come on. Let's go.

277
00:21:48,288 --> 00:21:49,993
Grandpa, look.

278
00:21:50,106 --> 00:21:52,802
Why are all the sticks in this bamboo tube good fortune sticks?

279
00:21:52,883 --> 00:21:55,562
That man stood there for a long time.

280
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,442
He must've tampered with them.

281
00:21:57,527 --> 00:21:58,802
You're still little.

282
00:21:58,883 --> 00:22:00,303
You don't get it.

283
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:02,442
This is a heavenly-bestowed good match.

284
00:22:02,523 --> 00:22:03,902
Though heaven bestows it,

285
00:22:03,983 --> 00:22:05,678
it still requires human effort.

286
00:22:11,755 --> 00:22:13,682
Zheng Shu Yi, watch your step.

287
00:22:17,953 --> 00:22:19,473
Now, you don't have to worry about me.

288
00:22:22,099 --> 00:22:24,002
When are you going to Zhanlan?

289
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,594
I was supposed to go today, but because of you...

290
00:22:28,231 --> 00:22:29,842
Because of me what?

291
00:22:29,956 --> 00:22:31,442
Because you're going tomorrow,

292
00:22:31,523 --> 00:22:33,283
so I rescheduled for the day after tomorrow.

293
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,762
I watched Zhanlan's news yesterday.

294
00:22:35,843 --> 00:22:37,962
I noticed that they're all saying

295
00:22:38,052 --> 00:22:40,568
the accident has nothing to do with their batteries,

296
00:22:40,682 --> 00:22:43,202
but they aren't providing any evidence.

297
00:22:43,586 --> 00:22:45,762
Right now, they're in a critical phase of fundraising.

298
00:22:45,874 --> 00:22:49,282
My guess is they're trying to downplay the incident.

299
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:52,922
So I'm going with you to Zhanlan tomorrow to find out more,

300
00:22:53,025 --> 00:22:54,425
see if we can gain some insights.

301
00:22:54,522 --> 00:22:56,844
That way, I can be better prepared for the interview.

302
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,220
That's why I rescheduled the interview.

303
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,579
But thanks to that,

304
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,602
I got to enjoy a day trip in Ancheng with you.

305
00:23:05,659 --> 00:23:07,650
So, I'm still the one benefiting from this.

306
00:23:10,567 --> 00:23:13,362
We still have time, let's move on to the next destination.

307
00:23:13,587 --> 00:23:16,362
- There's another one? - Remember I did my homework.

308
00:23:25,865 --> 00:23:27,745
Two yellow croaker noodles, one without onions.

309
00:23:27,842 --> 00:23:29,262
Got it. Wait a moment.

310
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,950
You really do love noodles.

311
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:45,202
(Shu Yi, when are you coming back?)

312
00:23:46,081 --> 00:23:47,602
(Have you finished your article?)

313
00:23:50,486 --> 00:23:53,046
(I'm struggling and suffering right now.)

314
00:23:53,127 --> 00:23:54,878
(I need your rescue.)

315
00:23:55,635 --> 00:23:57,002
(I'll be back in a couple of days.

316
00:24:01,563 --> 00:24:05,913
(With the way things are, I can't last another day.)

317
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:08,482
(While you're at it, why don't you work even harder?)

318
00:24:08,537 --> 00:24:10,097
(I'll send you some information about Zhanlan.)

319
00:24:10,121 --> 00:24:12,390
(Gather more information about them based on that.)

320
00:24:14,008 --> 00:24:17,122
(Shu Yi, you're so cruel to me.)

321
00:24:19,185 --> 00:24:20,664
(Leave it to me.)

322
00:24:20,776 --> 00:24:22,522
(I'm bound to mess it up.)

323
00:24:23,889 --> 00:24:26,042
Hi. Two yellow croaker noodles.

324
00:24:29,884 --> 00:24:31,979
- Thank you. - Please enjoy.

325
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,001
(Uncle.)

326
00:24:44,202 --> 00:24:46,642
(I'm overwhelmed with work.)

327
00:24:47,042 --> 00:24:49,871
(Uncle, when are you coming back?)

328
00:24:50,776 --> 00:24:52,362
(In a couple of days.)

329
00:24:53,447 --> 00:24:56,002
(Why are you also coming back in a couple of days?)

330
00:24:56,097 --> 00:24:58,616
(I've been working, and I haven't even had dinner yet.)

331
00:24:58,726 --> 00:25:00,396
(I'm so pitiful.)

332
00:25:00,524 --> 00:25:02,354
(I don't care.)

333
00:25:02,435 --> 00:25:05,593
(You must bring me some souvenirs and snacks)

334
00:25:05,697 --> 00:25:09,407
(to console my wounded heart and weary soul.)

335
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:11,560
(I will.)

336
00:25:12,645 --> 00:25:16,120
Not paying attention while eating is bad for your stomach.

337
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:18,404
I was texting my niece.

338
00:25:19,382 --> 00:25:20,502
What does she want from you?

339
00:25:20,544 --> 00:25:22,738
Nothing much. She was nagging me for souvenirs.

340
00:25:26,176 --> 00:25:29,362
It's funny how rich people want everything.

341
00:25:29,443 --> 00:25:30,882
Even things belong to other people.

342
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:33,042
Even souvenirs from a small town.

343
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,560
You're so different.

344
00:25:40,827 --> 00:25:43,518
Shi Yan, what do you really want?

345
00:25:43,825 --> 00:25:45,362
No matter what you want,

346
00:25:45,528 --> 00:25:48,322
have you ever considered your father and your family's feelings?

347
00:25:48,504 --> 00:25:50,104
Have you ever considered my feelings?

348
00:25:50,376 --> 00:25:52,002
I've told you what I want,

349
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:53,874
but you never understand me.

350
00:25:54,488 --> 00:25:55,908
I truly don't understand.

351
00:25:56,378 --> 00:25:57,857
You already have so much.

352
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,682
Why would you give up all of it?

353
00:25:59,881 --> 00:26:02,321
Why do you want so many things, things that are so different?

354
00:26:02,753 --> 00:26:04,353
Have you ever thought about what I want?

355
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,802
Do I even have a place

356
00:26:07,129 --> 00:26:08,598
in your life plan?

357
00:26:17,713 --> 00:26:19,118
Shi Yan,

358
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:21,165
let's break up.

359
00:26:30,545 --> 00:26:34,242
But of course, you're different from other rich people.

360
00:26:35,138 --> 00:26:36,266
Zheng Shu Yi.

361
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:40,498
Do you also think I'm unreasonable?

362
00:26:41,946 --> 00:26:44,122
Not at all. I've never thought of you that way.

363
00:26:44,465 --> 00:26:45,599
I've always seen you

364
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,999
as someone with strong ideas and opinions.

365
00:26:48,138 --> 00:26:49,938
You work relentlessly

366
00:26:50,086 --> 00:26:51,922
and make sacrifices for your ideals.

367
00:26:52,047 --> 00:26:53,328
In a world with so many people,

368
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:56,058
if you were like everyone else, it would be dull.

369
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,522
Plus, you've got a great eye.

370
00:26:59,658 --> 00:27:02,122
Really, especially in choosing me...

371
00:27:08,826 --> 00:27:11,402
For Yunchuang's interview and special feature.

372
00:27:17,464 --> 00:27:19,082
I also think

373
00:27:19,961 --> 00:27:21,402
I've got great eye.

374
00:27:40,219 --> 00:27:41,889
Oh, Yu You,

375
00:27:42,125 --> 00:27:44,035
do you know

376
00:27:44,631 --> 00:27:46,181
how tired I am?

377
00:27:46,978 --> 00:27:48,888
If you do, why haven't you texted me?

378
00:27:57,744 --> 00:27:59,362
(Let's chat for a minute.)

379
00:28:02,012 --> 00:28:04,201
(Professor Yu, did you also just get off work?)

380
00:28:05,906 --> 00:28:07,042
(Yes.)

381
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:10,968
(Since both of us are working late, )

382
00:28:11,073 --> 00:28:12,682
(how about I treat you to a meal?)

383
00:28:14,531 --> 00:28:15,951
(It's not necessary, thank you.)

384
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:19,162
He didn't say he's eaten already,

385
00:28:19,403 --> 00:28:20,922
so it means he hasn't eaten yet.

386
00:28:21,251 --> 00:28:23,922
(Are you having dinner with your girlfriend?)

387
00:28:27,938 --> 00:28:30,402
(If you're not interested, just reject her.)

388
00:28:30,499 --> 00:28:32,324
(That's the only way to truly avoid causing harm.)

389
00:28:32,348 --> 00:28:34,042
(Otherwise, you're just leading her on.)

390
00:28:37,046 --> 00:28:39,555
I don't have a girlfriend.

391
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:43,815
Yu You doesn't like men and doesn't have a girlfriend.

392
00:28:48,265 --> 00:28:49,586
(I haven't done you any favors, )

393
00:28:49,666 --> 00:28:51,802
(so, no need to treat me to a meal, Miss Qin.)

394
00:28:55,248 --> 00:28:56,642
(You've done something for me.)

395
00:28:56,723 --> 00:28:58,963
(You are chatting with me.)

396
00:28:59,069 --> 00:29:00,944
(It's like a refreshing breeze on the river, )

397
00:29:01,025 --> 00:29:02,746
(blowing away the gloom brought by work, )

398
00:29:02,826 --> 00:29:06,409
(allowing me to bask in the sunshine once again.)

399
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:07,648
(For such a great favor, )

400
00:29:07,729 --> 00:29:11,077
(I should at least treat you to ten meals.)

401
00:29:13,025 --> 00:29:14,562
Miss Qin, you really don't have to.

402
00:29:14,738 --> 00:29:16,506
(If your work pressure is too much, )

403
00:29:16,586 --> 00:29:18,642
(you can try doing activities to relieve stress, )

404
00:29:18,784 --> 00:29:20,144
like extreme sports.

405
00:29:20,326 --> 00:29:22,506
Of course, don't push yourself too hard.

406
00:29:22,706 --> 00:29:24,266
If it still doesn't relieve the stress,

407
00:29:24,339 --> 00:29:26,122
consider looking for a different job.

408
00:29:28,816 --> 00:29:31,802
Yu You, are you some kind of enlightened monk from a temple?

409
00:29:31,869 --> 00:29:34,220
How come you have no interest in girls at all?

410
00:29:42,783 --> 00:29:45,002
Thank you for hanging out with me today, Mr. Shi.

411
00:29:45,218 --> 00:29:47,122
I'm going back to my room. See you tomorrow.

412
00:29:55,076 --> 00:29:56,497
(Aren't you going to say anything?)

413
00:29:56,617 --> 00:29:59,602
(When someone thanks you, you should at least say "You're welcome".)

414
00:30:12,753 --> 00:30:14,122
You...

415
00:30:15,418 --> 00:30:16,838
Yes?

416
00:30:18,725 --> 00:30:20,145
Do you want to...

417
00:30:53,138 --> 00:30:54,939
Why are you calling me at this hour?

418
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,842
- Aren't you out having fun? - I'm at home.

419
00:30:57,938 --> 00:30:59,062
Don't worry about me.

420
00:30:59,154 --> 00:31:00,802
How's it going with Shi Yan?

421
00:31:02,116 --> 00:31:04,522
Not much going on. We've been working.

422
00:31:05,768 --> 00:31:08,288
This is your prime time.

423
00:31:08,738 --> 00:31:11,052
Yet you're calling me now. Something must be going on with you.

424
00:31:11,076 --> 00:31:12,695
Are you trying to avoid a suitor?

425
00:31:12,819 --> 00:31:14,847
How sharp and perceptive of you.

426
00:31:14,928 --> 00:31:17,314
Tell me then, which base are you and Shi Yan on?

427
00:31:17,426 --> 00:31:19,826
Have you held hands? Have you kissed?

428
00:31:19,936 --> 00:31:22,445
What do you care? Mind your own business.

429
00:31:22,978 --> 00:31:24,842
You can't keep avoiding him.

430
00:31:25,005 --> 00:31:26,425
I'm hanging up now.

431
00:31:38,265 --> 00:31:40,746
(You have found your destined love.)

432
00:31:40,896 --> 00:31:44,725
(You two are a match made in heaven.)

433
00:31:47,323 --> 00:31:48,953
(Do you have any idea how long Uncle Tian)

434
00:31:48,977 --> 00:31:50,977
(bombarded me with questions in the office today?)

435
00:31:51,418 --> 00:31:55,402
(He kept asking if your trip this time could seal the deal with Zhanlan.)

436
00:31:55,505 --> 00:31:57,065
(I had to keep serving him tea.)

437
00:31:57,285 --> 00:31:58,546
I'm telling you,

438
00:31:58,778 --> 00:32:00,527
you better figure out how to handle this.

439
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,922
If they find out you have other plans,

440
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,450
they won't just let it slide.

441
00:32:05,171 --> 00:32:06,322
(I got it.)

442
00:32:06,898 --> 00:32:08,318
But

443
00:32:08,746 --> 00:32:11,818
why did you leave Chen Sheng in Jiangcheng

444
00:32:11,938 --> 00:32:13,358
and go to Ancheng by yourself?

445
00:32:15,818 --> 00:32:18,008
Aren't you supposed to be out having fun tonight?

446
00:32:20,752 --> 00:32:21,793
I...

447
00:32:21,938 --> 00:32:23,162
I have things to do.

448
00:32:23,225 --> 00:32:24,442
I have to go.

449
00:32:59,587 --> 00:33:00,757
(I'm going to bed.)

450
00:33:00,838 --> 00:33:03,096
(Don't stay up too late. See you tomorrow.)

451
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,208
(Good night.)

452
00:33:34,331 --> 00:33:35,562
- Morning. - Morning.

453
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,648
We've been waiting for 20 minutes.

454
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,716
Did they say when they'd receive us?

455
00:34:00,985 --> 00:34:03,722
Mr. Shi, I'm really sorry for keeping both of you waiting.

456
00:34:03,803 --> 00:34:05,216
Mr. Jiang has been super busy today.

457
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,207
Allow me to show you around first.

458
00:34:07,298 --> 00:34:09,226
After the tour, I'll take you to Mr. Jiang.

459
00:34:09,405 --> 00:34:10,524
Thank you.

460
00:34:10,716 --> 00:34:11,962
This way, please.

461
00:34:25,433 --> 00:34:26,632
Mr. Jiang,

462
00:34:26,933 --> 00:34:28,353
they are here.

463
00:34:28,823 --> 00:34:30,246
Hello, Mr. Jiang.

464
00:34:32,378 --> 00:34:33,522
Hello.

465
00:34:34,952 --> 00:34:36,202
And this is...

466
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:39,282
This is my assistant.

467
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:45,242
Mr. Shi, coming to Ancheng this time,

468
00:34:45,338 --> 00:34:47,618
did you and your assistant visit the Xiaguang Temple?

469
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:49,282
It has fantastic scenery.

470
00:34:49,453 --> 00:34:51,173
- It's worth a visit. - We've been there.

471
00:34:53,732 --> 00:34:54,922
Have a seat.

472
00:34:57,098 --> 00:34:59,242
(Looks like Shi Yan has met a tough nut.)

473
00:35:05,458 --> 00:35:08,282
Mr. Shi, you are a young talent.

474
00:35:08,558 --> 00:35:12,097
Unlike our company, which has been around for over a decade.

475
00:35:12,216 --> 00:35:13,562
We tend to be more conservative.

476
00:35:13,766 --> 00:35:16,045
And we're rather cautious in choosing our partners.

477
00:35:16,168 --> 00:35:17,648
We don't take risks easily.

478
00:35:18,928 --> 00:35:20,351
You're right, we are young,

479
00:35:20,432 --> 00:35:22,242
and that's why we embrace challenges

480
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:23,749
and aren't afraid of failure.

481
00:35:24,276 --> 00:35:26,676
Yunchuang takes the partnership with Zhanlan very seriously.

482
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,607
For Yunchuang, the investment involved isn't a small sum either.

483
00:35:29,758 --> 00:35:32,202
That's why we approach Zhanlan with great care.

484
00:35:32,298 --> 00:35:34,369
That's also why I paid a personal visit this time.

485
00:35:37,364 --> 00:35:39,536
So, Mr. Shi, what do you want to talk to me about?

486
00:35:40,778 --> 00:35:43,744
Mr. Jiang, have you heard about the recent Hengxin new energy car accident

487
00:35:43,825 --> 00:35:45,816
that happened in Jiangcheng?

488
00:35:47,616 --> 00:35:48,885
No...

489
00:35:50,098 --> 00:35:51,567
I haven't heard of it.

490
00:35:54,837 --> 00:35:57,482
Coincidentally, my assistant was on that vehicle.

491
00:35:57,673 --> 00:36:00,482
Perhaps she can share with you what happened at the time.

492
00:36:05,401 --> 00:36:08,329
The e-hailing car I took that day was a Hengxin-branded car.

493
00:36:08,536 --> 00:36:10,882
At the time of the accident, the car suddenly slowed down

494
00:36:11,036 --> 00:36:13,802
and came to a stop without any warning,

495
00:36:13,945 --> 00:36:15,865
leading to a rear-end collision by a car behind.

496
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:23,962
This sounds like the full responsibility of the e-hailing driver.

497
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:28,043
Any product carries uncertainties,

498
00:36:28,124 --> 00:36:30,510
especially complex products like cars.

499
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:32,828
Various factors can lead to accidents.

500
00:36:32,976 --> 00:36:34,826
Just like your investment firm,

501
00:36:34,974 --> 00:36:38,525
can you guarantee that every project you invest in is risk-free?

502
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,780
Moreover, the driver still had 30% power left when making the turn.

503
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:43,362
That was purely an operational error,

504
00:36:43,496 --> 00:36:44,916
unrelated to the battery.

505
00:36:53,663 --> 00:36:56,214
Yunchuang, as an investment firm,

506
00:36:56,397 --> 00:36:59,549
should evaluate the overall value and potential of a company,

507
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:04,402
rather than fixating on a single incident.

508
00:37:04,523 --> 00:37:05,953
If that's the case,

509
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:08,162
I'm afraid it might be difficult

510
00:37:08,298 --> 00:37:09,718
for Zhanlan and Yunchuang

511
00:37:10,505 --> 00:37:12,525
to collaborate for long term.

512
00:37:14,525 --> 00:37:16,256
Mr. Jiang, may I ask,

513
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:18,322
as an expert in the battery industry,

514
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:21,440
do you believe this incident was caused by the battery?

515
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:24,162
There have been 18 incidents like this recently.

516
00:37:24,258 --> 00:37:26,245
Does Zhanlan have a solution

517
00:37:26,326 --> 00:37:28,473
or a specialized team to address this?

518
00:37:28,585 --> 00:37:29,638
Mr. Shi,

519
00:37:30,678 --> 00:37:34,256
these questions involve our company's confidential information.

520
00:37:39,016 --> 00:37:41,282
In that case, let's conclude our discussion here today.

521
00:37:41,378 --> 00:37:43,597
- Okay. - Thank you for sharing your insights.

522
00:37:47,978 --> 00:37:50,657
Six companies have made it through Zhanlan's first round of selection.

523
00:37:50,681 --> 00:37:53,282
In the end, we will choose three of them.

524
00:37:53,858 --> 00:37:56,362
Since you can afford to lose,

525
00:37:56,972 --> 00:37:59,602
you'd better go back and find new projects quickly.

526
00:38:00,818 --> 00:38:03,567
On your way back, think about

527
00:38:03,932 --> 00:38:06,162
how you can explain

528
00:38:06,235 --> 00:38:08,635
to the major shareholders of your company.

529
00:38:14,426 --> 00:38:16,082
What's there to explain?

530
00:38:16,258 --> 00:38:17,836
Mr. Shi personally communicated and conducted research,

531
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,242
confirming the investment risks.

532
00:38:19,334 --> 00:38:21,802
After we return, we will choose a more sincere

533
00:38:21,898 --> 00:38:23,337
and lower-risk project.

534
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:25,122
The shareholders are more than happy.

535
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,522
What is there to explain?

536
00:38:26,646 --> 00:38:28,726
Should we explain that a large company like Zhanlan,

537
00:38:28,786 --> 00:38:29,973
when faced with product issues,

538
00:38:29,997 --> 00:38:31,607
doesn't try to resolve them promptly

539
00:38:31,688 --> 00:38:33,608
but instead chooses to sweep them under the rug?

540
00:38:33,871 --> 00:38:36,751
Before coming here, I held you in high regard.

541
00:38:36,848 --> 00:38:38,989
I thought that you staying in your hometown to develop the business

542
00:38:39,013 --> 00:38:40,817
and lead Zhanlan to become an industry leader

543
00:38:40,904 --> 00:38:42,802
was sentimental and responsible.

544
00:38:42,859 --> 00:38:44,105
But I never thought

545
00:38:44,185 --> 00:38:46,965
the reality was so much different from my imagination.

546
00:38:57,936 --> 00:38:58,970
Let's go.

547
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,722
(What is he thinking?)

548
00:39:21,057 --> 00:39:22,882
(Is he worrying about)

549
00:39:23,503 --> 00:39:25,562
(what I said earlier?)

550
00:39:25,706 --> 00:39:28,506
(Yunchuang and Zhanlan's collaboration is probably off the table now.)

551
00:39:28,665 --> 00:39:30,522
(Then he brought up the shareholders, )

552
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,402
(hitting a sore spot.)

553
00:39:32,568 --> 00:39:34,242
(He's probably furious right now.)

554
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:41,130
(Oh no.)

555
00:39:41,226 --> 00:39:43,415
(Is he going to book a flight back?)

556
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:46,442
Take us to Anne's Restaurant.

557
00:39:46,618 --> 00:39:47,630
Got it, Mr. Shi.

558
00:39:49,209 --> 00:39:51,159
Assistant Zheng, do you have any objections?

559
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:55,065
No, I just thought...

560
00:39:55,176 --> 00:39:56,596
You thought what?

561
00:39:57,864 --> 00:39:59,762
I thought you weren't hungry yet.

562
00:40:02,158 --> 00:40:03,562
I'm hungry now.

563
00:40:16,338 --> 00:40:18,816
Were what Mr. Jiang said earlier all true?

564
00:40:18,926 --> 00:40:22,616
Do Yunchuang's shareholders really want you to secure Zhanlan?

565
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:28,959
Does that mean they don't know that you came to Ancheng to visit them?

566
00:40:32,298 --> 00:40:33,818
And I said that to Mr. Jiang just now.

567
00:40:33,845 --> 00:40:35,315
What are you going to do now?

568
00:40:36,832 --> 00:40:38,706
Didn't you already say it for me?

569
00:40:38,858 --> 00:40:40,018
After returning, we'll select

570
00:40:40,098 --> 00:40:43,028
a more sincere and lower-risk collaboration partner.

571
00:40:43,746 --> 00:40:45,495
Are you sure it's okay?

572
00:40:51,744 --> 00:40:53,483
Miss Zheng, do you have any more questions?

573
00:40:58,183 --> 00:40:59,463
Regarding this investment,

574
00:40:59,544 --> 00:41:01,624
my views differ from those of several board members.

575
00:41:01,658 --> 00:41:03,642
That incident served as a reminder,

576
00:41:03,723 --> 00:41:05,922
which is why I visited them personally.

577
00:41:05,978 --> 00:41:07,898
I can accept products that aren't perfect,

578
00:41:07,986 --> 00:41:10,282
but I cannot accept an attitude of avoiding issues.

579
00:41:10,532 --> 00:41:12,486
If there are issues with Zhanlan's batteries

580
00:41:12,567 --> 00:41:14,127
and no solution is in sight,

581
00:41:14,262 --> 00:41:16,722
the investment risk for Yunchuang would be too high.

582
00:41:16,864 --> 00:41:18,223
So,

583
00:41:18,404 --> 00:41:19,824
you were right.

584
00:41:22,426 --> 00:41:24,442
What you said at Zhanlan just now

585
00:41:24,553 --> 00:41:27,113
is exactly what I intend to tell the shareholders when I return.

586
00:41:30,778 --> 00:41:31,962
And

587
00:41:33,723 --> 00:41:35,465
your wording was precise.

588
00:41:35,568 --> 00:41:38,208
Your words were forceful and direct. You hit the nail on the head.

589
00:41:38,369 --> 00:41:40,038
You've set a great example for me.

590
00:41:45,765 --> 00:41:47,185
Aren't you hungry?

591
00:41:47,467 --> 00:41:48,937
Waiter, we're ready to order.

592
00:42:10,833 --> 00:42:13,527
Did you tell Mr. Fan the wrong place?

593
00:42:13,995 --> 00:42:15,834
He can't make it, he has something to attend to.

594
00:42:15,858 --> 00:42:17,282
He can't make it?

595
00:42:17,906 --> 00:42:19,326
Then I'll call for a cab.

596
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:23,482
I don't ride in other people's cars.

597
00:42:25,352 --> 00:42:27,282
Then shall we continue waiting?

598
00:42:27,942 --> 00:42:29,362
We could also walk.

599
00:42:29,976 --> 00:42:31,194
Walk?

600
00:42:35,376 --> 00:42:37,925
Do you really want to walk? It's a bit far.
