00:01:31,162 --> 00:01:36,041
(Only For Love)

2
00:01:36,122 --> 00:01:39,002
(Episode 30)

3
00:01:47,242 --> 00:01:48,761
What on earth are you thinking?

4
00:01:48,853 --> 00:01:51,790
I've never seen you like this before.

5
00:01:58,172 --> 00:01:59,432
I don't know.

6
00:02:39,373 --> 00:02:40,723
I knew that you would come.

7
00:02:41,924 --> 00:02:43,964
How could I return the skateboard if I didn't come?

8
00:02:44,213 --> 00:02:46,494
Shu Yi, do you really have to dampen my spirit like this?

9
00:02:49,053 --> 00:02:51,042
You want to know what happened that day, right?

10
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:52,973
If you can skate from here

11
00:02:53,893 --> 00:02:54,965
to there,

12
00:02:55,045 --> 00:02:56,242
I'll tell you.

13
00:03:18,286 --> 00:03:19,636
Can you tell me now?

14
00:03:20,692 --> 00:03:21,932
You lashed out at Shi Yan.

15
00:03:22,012 --> 00:03:24,042
Then, he got mad and took you away.

16
00:03:24,252 --> 00:03:25,602
What happened next?

17
00:03:26,012 --> 00:03:27,362
That was it.

18
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,641
(So many days have passed.)

19
00:03:33,773 --> 00:03:36,653
(What am I dreaming about foolishly?)

20
00:03:52,962 --> 00:03:54,219
(Biography)

21
00:03:55,053 --> 00:03:57,132
I may not be able to meet Shi Yan.

22
00:03:57,852 --> 00:03:59,202
But I believe

23
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,253
that I can get Luo Hao to meet me.

24
00:04:11,702 --> 00:04:13,052
Guess who I am.

25
00:04:13,517 --> 00:04:15,732
Fiona, when did you come back?

26
00:04:17,059 --> 00:04:19,442
Shi Yan, you are still as smart as ever.

27
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:22,013
I didn't tell you that I came back but you already know.

28
00:04:22,093 --> 00:04:24,163
Tell me. You miss me a lot, right?

29
00:04:24,253 --> 00:04:26,692
Why didn't you tell Yue that you've come back?

30
00:04:27,031 --> 00:04:29,082
I asked her not to tell you about it.

31
00:04:29,181 --> 00:04:30,260
At first, she didn't agree.

32
00:04:30,284 --> 00:04:34,074
But after telling her how surprised you would be, she agreed.

33
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,452
So, I came here right after I got off the plane.

34
00:04:37,532 --> 00:04:38,750
Are you surprised?

35
00:04:39,285 --> 00:04:40,844
What's your plan this time?

36
00:04:40,935 --> 00:04:42,775
I came back to help you with Yunchuang.

37
00:04:43,532 --> 00:04:45,639
I've heard about Yunchuang's current situation.

38
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:48,652
I know that my father and Uncle Zhang don't support you.

39
00:04:48,743 --> 00:04:50,384
But I still support you.

40
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,920
So, I came back this time to help you.

41
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,390
Fei Fei.

42
00:04:57,612 --> 00:04:58,962
Dad.

43
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,508
- Dad. - Dad?

44
00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:04,473
Fei Fei, I'm so disappointed in you.

45
00:05:04,564 --> 00:05:07,004
You left right after you deposited your luggage at home.

46
00:05:07,104 --> 00:05:09,096
Do you even care about me?

47
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:12,307
You are the most important person to me, Dad.

48
00:05:12,533 --> 00:05:15,924
Look. I came to Yunchuang to see you right away after I got off the plane.

49
00:05:16,037 --> 00:05:17,945
But I haven't seen Shi Yan in a long time.

50
00:05:18,036 --> 00:05:19,794
That's why I came here to talk to him first.

51
00:05:19,818 --> 00:05:21,738
Do you think I'll believe you?

52
00:05:23,535 --> 00:05:26,505
Shi Yan, I'm sorry for the trouble that Fei Fei must have caused you.

53
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,159
Uncle Tian, don't apologize.

54
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,283
Fiona is like a real sister to me.

55
00:05:32,324 --> 00:05:34,124
Later, are you going to...

56
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:41,581
Shi Yan, I'll have to trouble you

57
00:05:41,773 --> 00:05:43,453
to take Fei Fei home then.

58
00:05:43,893 --> 00:05:45,199
Okay.

59
00:05:47,153 --> 00:05:49,234
I'll deal with you when you get home.

60
00:05:50,573 --> 00:05:51,923
Bye, Dad.

61
00:05:57,773 --> 00:05:59,053
Shi Yan.

62
00:05:59,133 --> 00:06:00,612
What can I help you with?

63
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,922
(Zheng Shu Yi, lift up your head.)

64
00:06:18,813 --> 00:06:20,492
You have such big eyes.

65
00:06:20,893 --> 00:06:22,252
But why are you so blind?

66
00:06:22,374 --> 00:06:24,865
(Are you from Nine Flavors Noodle House?)

67
00:06:25,013 --> 00:06:27,413
(Yes. Your boyfriend must have ordered this from you.)

68
00:06:27,692 --> 00:06:29,172
(Your boyfriend is so attentive.)

69
00:06:29,292 --> 00:06:31,189
(He was on the phone with me for more than 10 minutes)

70
00:06:31,213 --> 00:06:34,603
(to teach me how to buy an insulated flask and pour the noodles in.)

71
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:45,052
(What should I do?)

72
00:06:45,932 --> 00:06:47,133
(I love him.)

73
00:06:47,228 --> 00:06:50,548
(But we can never be together anymore.)

74
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,257
(Since you love each other, )

75
00:06:53,281 --> 00:06:55,692
(why can't you talk it out with him?)

76
00:06:56,213 --> 00:06:57,812
(Don't you think it's regrettable)

77
00:06:57,932 --> 00:07:00,013
(if you just give up like this?)

78
00:07:09,773 --> 00:07:11,923
Hi. We've arrived at Mingyu Yunchuang.

79
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,402
(I'll explain everything to him properly when I see him.)

80
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,880
(There's nothing that can't be explained.)

81
00:07:58,292 --> 00:07:59,812
Miss, are you going to get off?

82
00:07:59,932 --> 00:08:01,653
I can't stop here.

83
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,159
Let's go.

84
00:08:06,813 --> 00:08:08,773
Are you here just to take a look at the building?

85
00:08:47,372 --> 00:08:50,330
Give me a cup of milk tea in exchange for a groundbreaking gossip.

86
00:08:51,213 --> 00:08:52,563
I'll pass.

87
00:08:53,695 --> 00:08:55,535
It's about Shi Yan.

88
00:08:57,813 --> 00:09:00,920
Shi Yan's childhood friend came back from abroad yesterday.

89
00:09:01,011 --> 00:09:02,638
She went to Yunchuang as soon as she arrived

90
00:09:02,662 --> 00:09:04,462
and chatted with Shi Yan until late at night.

91
00:09:04,652 --> 00:09:07,373
It's said that she's going to help Shi Yan at Yunchuang.

92
00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:10,029
What do you think? The milk tea is worth the price, right?

93
00:09:11,372 --> 00:09:13,812
That has nothing to do with me.

94
00:09:14,573 --> 00:09:16,452
You are right.

95
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,733
But you said this, right?

96
00:09:18,813 --> 00:09:21,040
You need to understand the person you interview well

97
00:09:21,121 --> 00:09:23,720
in order to write a profound article.

98
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,879
Such a beautiful foal.

99
00:09:40,445 --> 00:09:41,795
Give it a name.

100
00:09:43,012 --> 00:09:44,082
Me?

101
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,081
Yes. You.

102
00:09:46,173 --> 00:09:48,292
We are going to watch this foal grow up together.

103
00:09:48,413 --> 00:09:49,772
When it grows up,

104
00:09:49,852 --> 00:09:51,612
it'll run together with us through the wind.

105
00:09:51,813 --> 00:09:53,453
Then, it'll give birth to more foals.

106
00:09:53,533 --> 00:09:56,503
And we'll continue to watch them grow together forever and ever.

107
00:10:01,213 --> 00:10:02,503
What do you think?

108
00:10:02,813 --> 00:10:04,253
Do you have a name for it?

109
00:10:07,852 --> 00:10:09,812
I want to call it Yu Gong.

110
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,840
May it have a lot of offspring.

111
00:10:21,612 --> 00:10:24,292
Okay. Whatever the queen says.

112
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,252
The foals that are born this time are very cute.

113
00:10:29,373 --> 00:10:30,973
I'm sure you'll like them.

114
00:10:31,413 --> 00:10:32,548
Come.

115
00:10:37,933 --> 00:10:39,042
Dad.

116
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,480
You've never seen a foal as small as that, right?

117
00:10:58,789 --> 00:10:59,802
Miss Bi.

118
00:11:00,104 --> 00:11:01,454
If you don't mind,

119
00:11:01,601 --> 00:11:02,962
let me call you Shan Shan too.

120
00:11:07,478 --> 00:11:09,558
Finally, you have someone who'll keep you in line.

121
00:11:12,669 --> 00:11:14,148
He's quite a good man.

122
00:11:22,132 --> 00:11:23,373
Shi Yan will be here later.

123
00:11:23,453 --> 00:11:24,613
After our riding session,

124
00:11:24,693 --> 00:11:27,043
we can have a meal together, Ms. Tang.

125
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:28,883
It's okay.

126
00:11:29,037 --> 00:11:31,722
Mr. Guan told me that the ranch has a new foal.

127
00:11:31,883 --> 00:11:33,842
So, I came here to look at it out of curiosity.

128
00:11:33,933 --> 00:11:35,562
I'm meeting a friend tonight.

129
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:37,379
I'll let you have some alone time together.

130
00:11:37,554 --> 00:11:38,915
I'll get going now.

131
00:11:39,677 --> 00:11:41,517
I'll see Ms. Tang off.

132
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,670
I'll leave you young people to it.

133
00:11:44,293 --> 00:11:45,692
Shan Shan, have fun.

134
00:11:46,176 --> 00:11:48,093
- Let's go, Ms. Tang. - See you next time.

135
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:50,191
- See you next time. - Bye.

136
00:11:59,038 --> 00:12:00,678
Actually, you can stay.

137
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:05,283
I'm sorry, Xiang Cheng.

138
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:08,493
I'm not ready yet.

139
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,389
There's no need to apologize to me.

140
00:12:31,887 --> 00:12:34,176
No wonder the sky gets dark all of a sudden.

141
00:12:34,358 --> 00:12:37,579
It's because your friend who likes to block others is here.

142
00:12:41,813 --> 00:12:43,002
Shan Shan.

143
00:12:43,218 --> 00:12:45,138
I can vouch for Shi Yan's personality.

144
00:12:45,229 --> 00:12:47,268
He's a victim in this situation too.

145
00:12:50,045 --> 00:12:51,286
Shan Shan.

146
00:12:51,377 --> 00:12:53,216
Shi Yan cares a lot about Miss Zheng.

147
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,239
Yes.

148
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,969
He cared so much that he blocked Shu Yi

149
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:59,752
and accepted Xu Yu Ling's exclusive interview.

150
00:12:59,909 --> 00:13:02,480
He cared so much that he was entangled with another woman.

151
00:13:02,612 --> 00:13:03,916
I didn't.

152
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:08,583
Shan Shan.

153
00:13:08,912 --> 00:13:11,112
You said that Miss Zheng is still in love with Shi Yan.

154
00:13:11,175 --> 00:13:13,291
Shi Yan is deeply in love with Miss Zheng too.

155
00:13:13,652 --> 00:13:17,052
How about you tell Shi Yan what he has to do next?

156
00:13:17,132 --> 00:13:18,482
He'll do as you say.

157
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:26,328
Zheng Shu Yi has always been the only one I love.

158
00:13:29,144 --> 00:13:30,227
See? I was right.

159
00:13:30,326 --> 00:13:33,932
Shan Shan, help him out by talking to Miss Zheng about it.

160
00:13:34,012 --> 00:13:35,235
It's fine.

161
00:13:36,132 --> 00:13:38,280
This is between me and Zheng Shu Yi.

162
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,600
It should be up to us to solve this issue ourselves.

163
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,602
(Oh my! I heard that two shareholders from Yunchuang are going to divest.)

164
00:13:57,709 --> 00:13:59,122
(Who?)

165
00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:01,821
(I heard that a board member of Yunchuang is unhappy with Shi Yan.)

166
00:14:01,845 --> 00:14:03,641
(Le'an is not in deep trouble right now.)

167
00:14:03,732 --> 00:14:06,300
(Yunchuang is in a rough situation now with one disaster after another.)

168
00:14:06,324 --> 00:14:09,494
(Will Shi Yan go back to his dad?)

169
00:14:15,502 --> 00:14:16,722
What are you doing?

170
00:14:16,825 --> 00:14:18,153
You go to Yunchuang every day.

171
00:14:18,234 --> 00:14:20,475
How can you not know about anything?

172
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,750
Tell me. What should we do now?

173
00:14:26,664 --> 00:14:29,195
I'm sorry, Ms. Yi. I have not done my job well.

174
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,505
Enough.

175
00:14:30,659 --> 00:14:32,549
What's the point of an apology?

176
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,231
I need a solution to fix this.

177
00:14:34,581 --> 00:14:38,039
I want an in-depth article about this topic in our new issue.

178
00:14:38,185 --> 00:14:39,974
We've collaborated with Yunchuang for a long time.

179
00:14:39,998 --> 00:14:41,838
If we don't have more intel on this,

180
00:14:41,921 --> 00:14:43,681
we'll become a joke in this industry.

181
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,220
I understand, Ms. Yi.

182
00:14:48,215 --> 00:14:50,015
You don't have to work on this topic anymore.

183
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,560
Who will take over the topic then?

184
00:14:57,453 --> 00:14:58,803
Ms. Yi has asked for you.

185
00:15:01,797 --> 00:15:03,237
Ms. Yi has asked for you.

186
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,541
Shu Yi.

187
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:22,121
The editor-in-chief and I still hope that you can work on this topic.

188
00:15:24,772 --> 00:15:27,292
You should put your emotions aside for now.

189
00:15:27,383 --> 00:15:30,397
If it wasn't because Xu Yu Ling couldn't give us any valuable information,

190
00:15:30,535 --> 00:15:32,883
I wouldn't force you to do this against your will.

191
00:15:32,972 --> 00:15:35,693
This is a critical moment for Yunchuang.

192
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,290
And this topic on Yunchuang

193
00:15:37,397 --> 00:15:40,692
is a critical tool for your digital magazine.

194
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,356
Your topic

195
00:15:43,967 --> 00:15:46,935
may bear witness to a major incident in the near future.

196
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:50,151
(Shi Yan must be going through a lot right now.)

197
00:15:54,014 --> 00:15:57,629
Shu Yi, think carefully about your vision as a journalist

198
00:15:57,772 --> 00:16:00,212
and also your ambition to upgrade your digital magazine.

199
00:16:02,823 --> 00:16:04,325
I'd like to thank you and the editor-in-chief

200
00:16:04,349 --> 00:16:06,336
for giving me this chance to retake the topic.

201
00:16:06,431 --> 00:16:09,440
I'll do my best to write an in-depth article on it.

202
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,391
Mr. Chen, thank you.

203
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,882
Miss Zheng, there's no need to thank me.

204
00:16:30,014 --> 00:16:32,574
I'm sure Mr. Shi wants to see you too.

205
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:07,172
Shi...

206
00:17:12,852 --> 00:17:14,172
Mr. Shi.

207
00:17:45,652 --> 00:17:46,802
I...

208
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:53,298
Mr. Shi.

209
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,560
Thank you for giving me your valuable time.

210
00:17:56,412 --> 00:17:58,253
About Yunchuang's current situation,

211
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,893
I hope that it can...

212
00:17:59,973 --> 00:18:01,323
Zheng Shu Yi.

213
00:18:02,733 --> 00:18:04,732
Are you here just because of that?

214
00:18:10,612 --> 00:18:12,972
I can't tell you anything for now about Yunchuang.

215
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:14,928
Miss Zheng.

216
00:18:15,047 --> 00:18:16,224
You can go back now.

217
00:18:54,013 --> 00:18:55,278
Mr. Shi.

218
00:18:57,925 --> 00:18:59,162
Has she left?

219
00:18:59,979 --> 00:19:01,122
No.

220
00:19:04,937 --> 00:19:06,002
Where is she?

221
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,760
Those journalists who are waiting downstairs refuse to leave.

222
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:16,683
Come with me.

223
00:19:19,054 --> 00:19:21,738
But you haven't struck a deal with Mr. Tian and the others, right?

224
00:19:37,973 --> 00:19:39,428
- Mr. Shi is here. - Mr. Shi is here!

225
00:19:39,452 --> 00:19:40,802
Let's interview him.

226
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,680
Mr. Shi, can you tell us about Yunchuang's current situation?

227
00:19:46,704 --> 00:19:48,662
Have you regretted investing in Le'an Technology?

228
00:19:48,686 --> 00:19:51,852
Is the executive committee of Yunchuang going to crumble and be adjusted?

229
00:19:51,932 --> 00:19:54,428
Mr. Shi, is it true that two board members are leaving?

230
00:19:58,974 --> 00:20:01,145
Something has indeed happened in Yunchuang lately

231
00:20:01,236 --> 00:20:02,515
that needs to be attended to.

232
00:20:02,606 --> 00:20:03,914
But we haven't come to a conclusion.

233
00:20:03,938 --> 00:20:05,852
So, I can't reveal anything for now.

234
00:20:05,932 --> 00:20:09,323
Mr. Shi, what do you think about the two shareholders who want to divest?

235
00:20:19,027 --> 00:20:20,439
No matter it's Yunchuang or me,

236
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:23,212
we can't accept someone or something that can't stand firm.

237
00:20:23,303 --> 00:20:26,790
We'll always come across different issues and opinions at work.

238
00:20:26,881 --> 00:20:28,322
So, we should seek common ground

239
00:20:28,776 --> 00:20:30,057
and solve the issues together

240
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,760
instead of running away.

241
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,602
That's all I can say. Thank you.

242
00:20:39,693 --> 00:20:41,132
Please make way for him.

243
00:20:41,212 --> 00:20:43,132
Mr. Shi, say something else.

244
00:20:43,212 --> 00:20:45,093
Mr. Shi, please tell us more.

245
00:20:59,452 --> 00:21:00,936
Okay. I got it. Put it on my office table.

246
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,490
- I have to run. - Okay. Yu Ling.

247
00:21:02,581 --> 00:21:04,002
I'm sorry.

248
00:21:04,452 --> 00:21:05,692
Are you okay?

249
00:21:08,454 --> 00:21:09,739
Shu Yi.

250
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,376
Shu Yi. Wait.

251
00:21:16,163 --> 00:21:18,242
Shu Yi, are you okay?

252
00:21:21,675 --> 00:21:24,762
Shu Yi, did I hurt you or did something happen to you?

253
00:21:24,845 --> 00:21:26,195
Xu Yu Ling.

254
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:28,502
What did you do?

255
00:21:28,942 --> 00:21:32,145
I didn't do anything. We just ran into each other accidentally.

256
00:21:32,543 --> 00:21:35,172
Shu Yi, it was not that serious. Why are you crying?

257
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:38,613
Are you okay?

258
00:21:39,135 --> 00:21:40,814
I'm fine. You can leave.

259
00:21:41,573 --> 00:21:43,053
Are you sure you are okay?

260
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,154
Shu Yi.

261
00:21:53,517 --> 00:21:55,923
I'm fine. I have to work on my article. You can leave first.

262
00:22:36,482 --> 00:22:40,482
(Delete Contact)

263
00:23:29,161 --> 00:23:32,762
(Mr. Shi, do you want me to get you some food?)

264
00:24:03,155 --> 00:24:05,282
Are you really not going to eat it?

265
00:24:05,558 --> 00:24:08,530
Their signature seafood noodles are delicious.

266
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:10,242
You'll be able to taste the rich flavor

267
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:11,692
and you'll come back for more.

268
00:24:39,457 --> 00:24:41,901
(Since we can't go stargazing on New Year's Eve, )

269
00:24:41,982 --> 00:24:43,772
(how about we do that now?)

270
00:24:46,589 --> 00:24:49,061
(Wen's cloudy day, Yan Zi's rainy day, )

271
00:24:49,212 --> 00:24:50,612
(and Jie's sunny day)

272
00:24:50,692 --> 00:24:52,852
(will never be able to surpass the day I talk to you.)

273
00:24:54,294 --> 00:24:57,979
(After getting to know you, I realized that you are handsome and capable.)

274
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:00,761
(You are the Prince Charming of all the ladies out there.)

275
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,621
(Of course, I'm fond of you too.)

276
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:05,472
(So, I can't help myself but to get closer to you.)

277
00:25:05,616 --> 00:25:07,255
(I feel so ecstatic, )

278
00:25:07,336 --> 00:25:09,456
(joyful, and excited when I see you.)

279
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,250
(You have me now. I'll always be by your side.)

280
00:25:13,573 --> 00:25:15,868
(Be it a success or a failure, )

281
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:17,642
(we'll face it together.)

282
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,452
(After my work is done, )

283
00:25:19,544 --> 00:25:21,402
(I'll be able to see you this weekend.)

284
00:25:22,045 --> 00:25:24,445
(You are so clingy.)

285
00:25:25,615 --> 00:25:27,894
(I don't know how far Jiangcheng is from me.)

286
00:25:27,975 --> 00:25:30,574
(So, don't you go being jealous again.)

287
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,138
(Do you want to eat some noodles?)

288
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:44,628
Good day, my fellow students.

289
00:26:45,293 --> 00:26:47,532
Good day, Professor Yu.

290
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:50,053
Why are you here so early today?

291
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,430
Because I need to work hard to complete my new life goal.

292
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:56,363
Your new life goal?

293
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:57,932
What is it?

294
00:26:59,014 --> 00:27:00,364
The class is starting.

295
00:27:01,412 --> 00:27:04,615
Okay now. Please turn to page 163 of your textbook.

296
00:27:05,132 --> 00:27:07,812
We'll learn about the valuation of tradable financial assets today.

297
00:27:11,805 --> 00:27:14,085
Okay. That's it for our class today.

298
00:27:14,212 --> 00:27:15,290
You are dismissed.

299
00:27:19,813 --> 00:27:21,052
Yu Cheng.

300
00:27:21,132 --> 00:27:22,372
Can you look at this for me?

301
00:27:22,514 --> 00:27:23,744
I don't understand it.

302
00:27:24,631 --> 00:27:25,775
No problem.

303
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,539
Professor Yu, can you sign this for me?

304
00:27:33,973 --> 00:27:35,093
Sure.

305
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,550
Isn't that your girlfriend?

306
00:27:43,736 --> 00:27:45,389
Is she here to accompany you?

307
00:27:45,692 --> 00:27:47,843
Professor Yu, the two of you are so sweet together.

308
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,830
She's diligent.

309
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,289
Thank you.

310
00:27:54,844 --> 00:27:57,262
First, the end goal of the monetary policy

311
00:27:57,377 --> 00:27:58,872
needs to be clarified.

312
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,680
I'll get going now.

313
00:28:08,813 --> 00:28:09,961
Yue.

314
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,320
Do you have a boyfriend?

315
00:28:14,411 --> 00:28:15,761
Not yet.

316
00:28:18,142 --> 00:28:20,938
If that's the case, can I pursue you?

317
00:28:28,341 --> 00:28:29,615
Yu Cheng.

318
00:28:29,706 --> 00:28:32,637
We are not suitable for each other and we don't know each other.

319
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,721
I know that we haven't known each other for a long time.

320
00:28:37,565 --> 00:28:39,016
But I really like you.

321
00:28:39,518 --> 00:28:40,612
Besides,

322
00:28:40,692 --> 00:28:43,002
we have a lot of time to get to know each other better.

323
00:28:43,758 --> 00:28:47,360
If you are willing, we can give it a go.

324
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,935
Professor Yu.

325
00:29:08,061 --> 00:29:09,411
Are you

326
00:29:09,766 --> 00:29:11,116
in the middle of a discussion?

327
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,356
I'm confessing to Yue.

328
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,430
Yue.

329
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,190
I really like you.

330
00:29:24,572 --> 00:29:26,242
I hope that you can give me a chance.

331
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:28,881
I'll treat this relationship seriously

332
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,559
and I won't let it affect our studies.

333
00:29:49,182 --> 00:29:50,532
Yu Cheng.

334
00:29:50,763 --> 00:29:52,743
Thank you for liking me.

335
00:29:53,806 --> 00:29:56,640
But I can't accept your affection.

336
00:29:57,395 --> 00:30:00,106
We have a lot of time to get to know each other.

337
00:30:00,452 --> 00:30:02,616
But before that,

338
00:30:02,796 --> 00:30:07,683
we need something like magic

339
00:30:07,871 --> 00:30:09,748
that can miraculously make us

340
00:30:09,829 --> 00:30:12,880
want to get to know each other better.

341
00:30:15,571 --> 00:30:16,921
So,

342
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:19,533
you are not willing to get to know me better.

343
00:30:21,221 --> 00:30:22,449
Yes.

344
00:30:22,572 --> 00:30:23,922
I'm not willing to do that.

345
00:30:29,053 --> 00:30:30,202
Okay.

346
00:30:30,654 --> 00:30:32,740
Professor Yu, I'll get going now.

347
00:30:46,774 --> 00:30:48,065
Qin Shi Yue.

348
00:30:52,484 --> 00:30:54,284
Professor Yu, what is it?

349
00:30:59,093 --> 00:31:01,613
- If there's nothing else, I'll... - I have something to say.

350
00:31:03,638 --> 00:31:04,988
Let me take you to a place.

351
00:31:44,309 --> 00:31:45,544
Get on.

352
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,067
Hold on to me tightly. It's fine.

353
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,962
I have good riding skills.

354
00:32:10,109 --> 00:32:11,420
Don't be afraid.

355
00:33:07,479 --> 00:33:08,829
This is so beautiful.

356
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,590
Qin Shi Yue.

357
00:33:29,061 --> 00:33:30,322
I...

358
00:33:30,806 --> 00:33:32,287
I have something to tell you.

359
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:38,231
We

360
00:33:39,752 --> 00:33:41,102
Are not suitable for each other.

361
00:33:41,848 --> 00:33:43,647
Our age, our identity, and our personality

362
00:33:44,493 --> 00:33:45,843
are incompatible with each other.

363
00:33:47,009 --> 00:33:48,489
You are young, interesting,

364
00:33:49,093 --> 00:33:50,443
and cute.

365
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:53,562
I know that you are interested in me.

366
00:33:54,262 --> 00:33:56,141
And I also know that I can bring you

367
00:33:56,415 --> 00:33:57,734
some temporary excitement,

368
00:33:57,932 --> 00:34:00,032
anticipation, and thrill.

369
00:34:02,688 --> 00:34:04,488
But do you know the real me?

370
00:34:05,797 --> 00:34:07,147
For instance,

371
00:34:07,293 --> 00:34:09,093
I'm a picky eater and I can't eat spicy food.

372
00:34:09,677 --> 00:34:13,489
I like motorcycle that is thrilling and dangerous.

373
00:34:13,615 --> 00:34:14,965
Did you bring me

374
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:18,962
to this mountain with such a beautiful view at night just to tell me these?

375
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:21,208
- I... - Don't you ever go online?

376
00:34:21,299 --> 00:34:22,922
Haven't you read about this quote?

377
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:25,215
If you can't accept me at my worst,

378
00:34:25,344 --> 00:34:27,689
then, you don't deserve me at my best.

379
00:34:27,911 --> 00:34:30,074
I'm just looking for someone I like.

380
00:34:30,165 --> 00:34:33,602
I'm not choosing the perfect man for a mysterious organization.

381
00:34:34,303 --> 00:34:36,543
What I want to say is that I've fallen in love with you.

382
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:43,396
I think

383
00:34:43,687 --> 00:34:45,487
there are many things that are wrong with me.

384
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,280
Tell me.

385
00:34:51,511 --> 00:34:52,922
What's wrong with you?

386
00:34:53,373 --> 00:34:54,723
I...

387
00:34:54,904 --> 00:34:56,254
I'm older than you.

388
00:34:56,696 --> 00:34:58,051
I may be boring.

389
00:34:58,132 --> 00:35:00,243
It won't always be exciting with me.

390
00:35:01,438 --> 00:35:02,788
You are right.

391
00:35:02,983 --> 00:35:04,581
Riding a motorcycle is indeed thrilling.

392
00:35:04,605 --> 00:35:06,326
But you can't ride it all the time.

393
00:35:07,006 --> 00:35:08,356
What if...

394
00:35:08,725 --> 00:35:11,681
What if I don't enjoy riding it anymore after this?

395
00:35:18,383 --> 00:35:21,383
That's why I'm here to tell you about my situation and my feelings for you.

396
00:35:21,885 --> 00:35:23,765
I hope that you can make the choice yourself.

397
00:35:29,414 --> 00:35:30,573
Z900.

398
00:35:30,664 --> 00:35:32,305
It's trendy, thrilling, and free.

399
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:34,723
It's on the higher spectrum in the Z series.

400
00:35:34,853 --> 00:35:37,314
Its actual power output is 948CC.

401
00:35:37,405 --> 00:35:39,893
It has a maximum horsepower of 117.3 horses.

402
00:35:40,292 --> 00:35:42,141
The Z900 has great features too.

403
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,989
It has the classic inline four-cylinder engine

404
00:35:44,013 --> 00:35:46,213
that can reach up to 10,000 rpm.

405
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:51,013
Also, it can reach a peak torque of 95 Nm at 7,700 rpm.

406
00:35:51,093 --> 00:35:53,264
What do you think? Did I get anything wrong?

407
00:35:55,245 --> 00:35:56,766
How do you know about these things?

408
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,652
Don't misunderstand. I didn't memorize these facts.

409
00:36:00,991 --> 00:36:03,097
I've always liked riding a motorcycle.

410
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,520
I played around with motorcycles often while I was abroad.

411
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:10,473
So, as you can see,

412
00:36:11,478 --> 00:36:13,438
I also have a side to me that no one knows about.

413
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,918
Since we don't know each other well enough,

414
00:36:15,942 --> 00:36:18,182
we can just work on it more.

415
00:36:19,045 --> 00:36:22,663
Everyone has their own unique lifestyle and hobbies.

416
00:36:22,754 --> 00:36:24,634
There's no need to change yourself for someone.

417
00:36:25,212 --> 00:36:26,562
If you like someone,

418
00:36:26,652 --> 00:36:28,373
you'll accept everything about him.

419
00:36:28,732 --> 00:36:30,293
You may even become more like him.

420
00:36:31,612 --> 00:36:33,052
Love is...

421
00:36:36,188 --> 00:36:37,538
Do you understand?

422
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,039
So,

423
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:41,050
don't try to be rational about it.

424
00:36:42,692 --> 00:36:44,042
Liking you

425
00:36:44,732 --> 00:36:46,082
is my rationale.

426
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,110
You are right.

427
00:37:01,132 --> 00:37:02,482
If that's the case,

428
00:37:06,237 --> 00:37:07,587
please take care of me

429
00:37:07,772 --> 00:37:09,213
in the future,

430
00:37:09,533 --> 00:37:10,883
Miss Qin.

431
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:16,893
Professor Yu is my boyfriend now!

432
00:37:31,722 --> 00:37:37,682
(Bogang Yunwan)

433
00:37:40,795 --> 00:37:42,145
You should go back now.

434
00:37:42,812 --> 00:37:44,162
Just like that?

435
00:37:47,172 --> 00:37:51,094
Can I ask for a goodnight kiss from my boyfriend?

436
00:38:08,298 --> 00:38:10,253
You can take the initiative next time.

437
00:38:12,318 --> 00:38:13,668
Bye, my boyfriend!

438
00:38:36,651 --> 00:38:40,091
You are so busy. You don't have to accompany me to buy a luggage.

439
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,667
Dark Horse is doing well lately.

440
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,549
I'm sure we can overcome our technical issues.

441
00:38:46,573 --> 00:38:48,613
So, I have ample time to accompany you.

442
00:38:53,053 --> 00:38:55,082
(If Dark Horse is doing so well, )

443
00:38:55,252 --> 00:38:58,704
(is Shi Yan in an even more precarious situation now?)

444
00:39:04,305 --> 00:39:05,785
Do you want to go in and take a look?

445
00:39:07,853 --> 00:39:10,972
- What's wrong? - (Who is that person to Shu Yi?)

446
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:14,319
(Does my uncle know about it?)

447
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,381
(What about my uncle?)

448
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:18,242
Let's go and take a look.

449
00:39:21,861 --> 00:39:23,221
Hello. This way, please.

450
00:39:25,198 --> 00:39:27,837
What do you think about this table for couples?

451
00:39:29,013 --> 00:39:30,733
We are just friends.

452
00:39:31,084 --> 00:39:32,245
Can I sit over there?

453
00:39:32,349 --> 00:39:33,699
Yes.

454
00:39:34,692 --> 00:39:35,740
After you.

455
00:39:39,933 --> 00:39:41,335
Hi, this is the menu.

456
00:39:41,426 --> 00:39:43,179
You can take a look. Call me if you need me.

457
00:39:43,203 --> 00:39:44,282
Thank you.

458
00:39:53,825 --> 00:39:54,962
Shu Yi.

459
00:39:55,053 --> 00:39:56,403
What a coincidence!

460
00:39:57,093 --> 00:39:58,443
(What's going on?)

461
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:07,173
Shu Yi. We haven't eaten together in so long.

462
00:40:08,533 --> 00:40:10,173
It's not that long.

463
00:40:11,503 --> 00:40:14,640
I haven't eaten with my uncle in a long time either.

464
00:40:22,732 --> 00:40:24,612
How about we have a meal together?

465
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:27,408
Sorry about the interruption.

466
00:40:38,252 --> 00:40:39,869
All of the dishes are here. Please enjoy them.

467
00:40:39,893 --> 00:40:41,243
- Thank you. - Thank you.

468
00:40:48,493 --> 00:40:50,932
(This plate of fish is Shu Yi.)

469
00:40:52,037 --> 00:40:53,387
The soup is very nice.

470
00:40:53,668 --> 00:40:54,931
Give it a taste.

471
00:41:01,252 --> 00:41:02,602
It's really nice.

472
00:41:04,022 --> 00:41:06,623
(Uncle, she's drinking the fish soup.)

473
00:41:09,541 --> 00:41:10,821
Don't just play with your phone.

474
00:41:10,893 --> 00:41:12,052
Drink it while it's hot.

475
00:41:12,132 --> 00:41:13,373
Thank you.

476
00:41:15,941 --> 00:41:19,774
This white asparagus and bamboo shoot dish is not bad either.

477
00:41:19,855 --> 00:41:20,895
It's their specialty dish.

478
00:41:20,973 --> 00:41:22,323
Shu Yi.

479
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,879
This is what you prefer.

480
00:41:28,453 --> 00:41:30,923
I remember that my uncle loves bamboo shoots too.

481
00:41:31,053 --> 00:41:34,932
Especially the bamboo shoots from Qing'an, your homeland.

482
00:41:41,093 --> 00:41:42,853
When I went there during the Lunar New Year,

483
00:41:42,893 --> 00:41:45,613
why didn't you tell me that the bamboo shoots from Qing'an are nice?

484
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,999
Because you ate all of the bamboo shoots in Qing'an.

485
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:14,514
(Uncle. Do you want to keep your girlfriend or not?)

486
00:42:14,595 --> 00:42:16,835
(Someone else is going to eat all of the bamboo shoots.)

487
00:42:25,212 --> 00:42:26,362
Thank you.

488
00:42:32,076 --> 00:42:35,276
(Uncle, have you read my messages or not?)

489
00:42:35,772 --> 00:42:37,692
(He's so attentive and considerate.)

490
00:42:37,787 --> 00:42:39,467
(Most importantly, he's very proactive.)

491
00:43:08,093 --> 00:43:10,253
(This plate of fish is Shu Yi.)

492
00:43:10,438 --> 00:43:12,997
(Uncle, she's drinking the fish soup.)

493
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:16,333
(Uncle. Do you want to keep your girlfriend or not?)

494
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:18,392
(Someone else is going to eat all of the bamboo shoots.)

495
00:43:18,416 --> 00:43:21,760
(Uncle, have you read my messages or not?)

496
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:23,886
(He's so attentive and considerate.)

497
00:43:23,967 --> 00:43:25,807
(Most importantly, he's very proactive.)
