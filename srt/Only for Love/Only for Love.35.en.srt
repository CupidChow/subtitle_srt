00:01:30,922 --> 00:01:36,107
(Only For Love)

2
00:01:36,188 --> 00:01:39,042
(Episode 35)

3
00:02:19,644 --> 00:02:22,716
Mr. Shi, Mr. Tian and several shareholders said they couldn't reach you.

4
00:02:22,797 --> 00:02:25,122
They asked you to give them a call when you have time.

5
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:27,482
Got it.

6
00:02:38,988 --> 00:02:42,214
(Mr. Shi, have you read the article from Financial Introduce?)

7
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,644
(It's the article written by Zheng Shu Yi.)

8
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:46,798
(I'm terribly sorry.)

9
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,602
(Le'an's issues have brought crisis and burdens to Yunchuang.)

10
00:02:50,768 --> 00:02:53,598
Chen Kang, Yunchuang and Le'an are partners.

11
00:02:53,761 --> 00:02:54,999
We're in this together.

12
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,219
You didn't burden us.

13
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,396
Since the situation has occurred,

14
00:02:58,477 --> 00:03:01,162
the top priority now is to navigate Le'an's next steps well.

15
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,242
(I've been thinking a lot these past two days.)

16
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,642
(I'll carefully consider the collaboration between Le'an and Dark Horse.)

17
00:03:08,752 --> 00:03:12,960
If needed, I can use my connections to help you contact Yi Yang.

18
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,410
Fiona, please come to my office.

19
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:35,509
You want to collaborate, but not through acquisition,

20
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,122
and you want to share the results?

21
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:39,790
Both sides engage in a specific collaboration,

22
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,774
jointly tackle this technology and share the results.

23
00:03:42,909 --> 00:03:44,135
Is it feasible?

24
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:49,482
Let's put aside issues like patent division and profit distribution.

25
00:03:49,981 --> 00:03:52,421
Just looking at the competition between Dark Horse and Le'an,

26
00:03:52,485 --> 00:03:54,925
the follow-up to this matter is going to be very complicated.

27
00:03:55,245 --> 00:03:56,554
Besides,

28
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:58,802
Dark Horse is determined to acquire Le'an.

29
00:03:58,982 --> 00:04:00,982
Will he be willing to collaborate on this project?

30
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,082
I'm not sure about that.

31
00:04:03,226 --> 00:04:05,069
But Dark Horse's progress isn't going smoothly either.

32
00:04:05,093 --> 00:04:06,402
I want to give it a try.

33
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:09,962
Shi Yan, if you want to try, you can go ahead.

34
00:04:10,054 --> 00:04:13,599
Leave the legal matters and the collaboration details to me.

35
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,140
Thanks.

36
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,559
Uncle Tian...

37
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,802
Don't worry about him.

38
00:04:21,884 --> 00:04:23,932
If Le'an succeeds, my dad will also make a profit.

39
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,753
He won't be angry with me anyway.

40
00:04:41,246 --> 00:04:42,562
I wrote like this.

41
00:04:42,705 --> 00:04:45,136
Will Shi Yan be in trouble now?

42
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,562
You're back.

43
00:05:26,107 --> 00:05:28,817
Are you tired? Do you want me to give you a shoulder massage?

44
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:31,402
Did you do anything bad?

45
00:05:32,501 --> 00:05:34,242
What can I do?

46
00:05:34,622 --> 00:05:37,022
It's just that I haven't seen you for a day, and I miss you.

47
00:05:38,757 --> 00:05:41,386
Did you read the article I wrote?

48
00:05:42,598 --> 00:05:44,698
It's sharp and straight to the point.

49
00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:46,420
High standard as always.

50
00:05:47,073 --> 00:05:49,762
Do you think it's a bit too sharp?

51
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,842
Did the board pressure you?

52
00:05:52,537 --> 00:05:54,602
The article you wrote is well-founded.

53
00:05:54,683 --> 00:05:55,904
I don't see any problems.

54
00:05:56,045 --> 00:05:58,675
Their pressure has nothing to do with your article.

55
00:05:59,213 --> 00:06:00,803
That's a yes.

56
00:06:01,913 --> 00:06:04,223
So, what can I do for you?

57
00:06:08,194 --> 00:06:10,534
You were stating facts and expressing opinions.

58
00:06:10,623 --> 00:06:12,743
That's the meaning and value of journalism.

59
00:06:12,984 --> 00:06:15,344
Maybe someone will come up with new ideas after reading it,

60
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,920
and Yunchuang will have new opportunities because of this.

61
00:06:19,597 --> 00:06:22,787
If you really want to make up for it, why don't you do me a favor?

62
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:24,402
What is it?

63
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,482
I don't have Yi Yang's contact information.

64
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:28,467
I want to meet him.

65
00:06:29,141 --> 00:06:30,141
Yi Yang?

66
00:06:31,742 --> 00:06:33,652
You want to talk to him about Le'an?

67
00:06:34,774 --> 00:06:36,202
Can I sit in?

68
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,962
Confidential business.

69
00:06:42,886 --> 00:06:45,762
Then I'll thank you in advance, Miss Zheng.

70
00:06:58,206 --> 00:07:00,202
Mr. Shi, have you convinced Mr. Chen?

71
00:07:00,772 --> 00:07:01,772
No.

72
00:07:03,108 --> 00:07:05,567
I'm here to convince you to give up the acquisition.

73
00:07:07,878 --> 00:07:09,817
Mr. Shi, when did you become so humorous?

74
00:07:11,982 --> 00:07:14,442
Le'an has a mature team and production line,

75
00:07:14,616 --> 00:07:17,042
while Dark Horse has core technical talents like Bruce.

76
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,639
Both companies have their advantages and plans.

77
00:07:19,782 --> 00:07:22,773
A simple acquisition is not the best option for both parties.

78
00:07:23,755 --> 00:07:26,121
Le'an is determined to build domestic chips

79
00:07:26,202 --> 00:07:27,586
and continuously upgrade technology.

80
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,880
Therefore, they cannot accept Dark Horse's acquisition.

81
00:07:30,077 --> 00:07:32,882
In terms of technology, Dark horse will continue to pursue excellence.

82
00:07:33,013 --> 00:07:34,973
Otherwise, Bruce wouldn't have joined Dark Horse.

83
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,516
But Bruce's research hasn't made any progress.

84
00:07:48,811 --> 00:07:50,522
Mr. Yi, why don't you consider

85
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:52,381
a collaboration and joint research of both companies

86
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:55,875
to overcome technical challenges together and share the honors and results.

87
00:08:04,596 --> 00:08:05,802
Mr. Shi.

88
00:08:05,968 --> 00:08:07,168
The current situation of Le'an

89
00:08:07,342 --> 00:08:09,839
can be aptly described as being at a dead end.

90
00:08:09,973 --> 00:08:12,973
Where do you get the confidence to discuss cooperation and sharing with me?

91
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:16,002
To be honest,

92
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,402
Chen Kang probably knows himself that

93
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,842
if he doesn't accept Dark Horse's acquisition,

94
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:22,482
the only outcome awaiting Le'an

95
00:08:22,805 --> 00:08:23,906
is failure.

96
00:08:25,326 --> 00:08:27,042
It's the same for Dark Horse.

97
00:08:36,071 --> 00:08:38,202
Bruce's personal ability is indeed very strong.

98
00:08:38,286 --> 00:08:41,305
But technology research and development cannot be solved by one person.

99
00:08:41,678 --> 00:08:42,682
At the current moment,

100
00:08:42,748 --> 00:08:44,915
where can Dark Horse find so many mature technical talents

101
00:08:44,939 --> 00:08:46,219
to support Bruce?

102
00:08:46,581 --> 00:08:47,841
Even if you can find them,

103
00:08:47,957 --> 00:08:50,467
have you calculated how much time it will take?

104
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,002
So Mr. Yi, you might as well consider my suggestion.

105
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,100
Start with cooperation to achieve mutual success

106
00:08:58,294 --> 00:09:00,483
and leave time for talent recruitment.

107
00:09:04,766 --> 00:09:06,686
Technology will continue to iterate and upgrade.

108
00:09:06,717 --> 00:09:09,562
This is just a phase of the competition.

109
00:09:09,834 --> 00:09:12,962
In the next stage, Dark Horse can still compete with Le'an

110
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:15,802
based on their abilities.

111
00:09:25,813 --> 00:09:27,482
I'll consider your proposal.

112
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:31,282
However, you took the initiative to ask me for help today.

113
00:09:32,119 --> 00:09:33,362
Does Shu Yi know about this?

114
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:38,002
Indeed, I should thank

115
00:09:38,636 --> 00:09:39,842
my girlfriend.

116
00:09:40,182 --> 00:09:42,782
Otherwise, it wouldn't have been so easy for me to meet with you.

117
00:10:02,096 --> 00:10:04,282
(Singer Song Yue Lan hugged a stranger in hospital)

118
00:10:12,043 --> 00:10:14,282
How, how could it be...

119
00:10:14,503 --> 00:10:15,972
Qin Xiao Ming?

120
00:10:21,614 --> 00:10:23,442
Hello, where are you?

121
00:10:23,558 --> 00:10:24,558
(I'm at the hospital.)

122
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,962
(Yue had a car accident.)

123
00:10:27,281 --> 00:10:28,722
How did she get into a car accident?

124
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:30,559
Is she okay? What's the situation now?

125
00:10:30,677 --> 00:10:32,677
(It's okay. It's not serious.)

126
00:10:33,654 --> 00:10:34,922
Which hospital is she in?

127
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:36,402
(Jiangcheng First Hospital.)

128
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,682
I'll come over immediately.

129
00:11:02,256 --> 00:11:03,600
Hello, Yue, you...

130
00:11:03,681 --> 00:11:05,150
(Yu You, it's me.)

131
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,082
Where is Yue?

132
00:11:07,207 --> 00:11:09,855
(She had a car accident and is currently undergoing an examination.)

133
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:10,962
Car accident?

134
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,282
Which hospital is she in?

135
00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:29,082
Is Yue really okay?

136
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,829
She's fine, just a bit shocked.

137
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,602
The doctor has already examined her. It's just scratches.

138
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,282
Didn't I tell you she's okay?

139
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,796
Why did you rush over?

140
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,042
You think everyone is like you?

141
00:11:43,116 --> 00:11:45,877
When facing things, you're as calm as if you've taken an apathy pill.

142
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:52,198
By the way, did you see the news?

143
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,002
Mr. Qin was caught.

144
00:11:54,152 --> 00:11:55,212
With Song Yue Lan.

145
00:11:55,293 --> 00:11:56,312
I saw that.

146
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,282
How can you be so calm about this matter too?

147
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,082
What's wrong?

148
00:12:09,009 --> 00:12:11,628
I feel very sad, just like you.

149
00:12:12,381 --> 00:12:13,402
Why?

150
00:12:14,969 --> 00:12:18,119
I never expected that the closest encounter with my idol

151
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,562
would be because she did such a thing with my boyfriend's brother-in-law.

152
00:12:21,671 --> 00:12:23,442
How did this happen?

153
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:26,402
How could it be Mr. Qin and Song Yue Lan?

154
00:12:26,701 --> 00:12:28,711
Didn't they say she's a model of both virtue and talent?

155
00:12:28,735 --> 00:12:30,882
Yet, she committed such an act.

156
00:12:32,647 --> 00:12:34,631
She even said she would forever celebrate love.

157
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:35,912
Isn't this ridiculous?

158
00:12:35,993 --> 00:12:37,822
Doesn't she feel ashamed?

159
00:12:39,907 --> 00:12:40,907
Sister.

160
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:47,319
(I never expected that the first time I met Shi Yan's sister)

161
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,642
(would be in such an embarrassing situation.)

162
00:12:49,771 --> 00:12:52,579
(The feeling of betrayal is so painful.)

163
00:13:08,638 --> 00:13:10,908
(Is this an illusion?)

164
00:13:17,542 --> 00:13:19,322
Shu Yi, she's my sister.

165
00:13:20,524 --> 00:13:22,834
(Shi Huai Man is Song Yue Lan?)

166
00:13:22,979 --> 00:13:25,202
(Song Yue Lan is Shi Huai Man?)

167
00:13:25,522 --> 00:13:27,282
Sister?

168
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:31,459
You look so much like Song Yue Lan.

169
00:13:32,861 --> 00:13:34,345
Everyone says that.

170
00:13:35,197 --> 00:13:36,802
I'll go over there first.

171
00:13:38,628 --> 00:13:41,459
(I experienced my second social death, )

172
00:13:41,567 --> 00:13:44,162
(and it's the kind that can't be redeemed.)

173
00:13:45,605 --> 00:13:47,995
Is there anything you want to tell me?

174
00:13:50,565 --> 00:13:51,565
Yes.

175
00:13:51,693 --> 00:13:52,713
I'm married.

176
00:13:52,891 --> 00:13:54,362
I forgot to tell the fans.

177
00:14:03,174 --> 00:14:04,883
Why are you so cute?

178
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:07,522
Is it funny?

179
00:14:14,878 --> 00:14:16,162
You woke up.

180
00:14:16,688 --> 00:14:18,522
- How are you? - Mom.

181
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,189
I saw the news.

182
00:14:23,349 --> 00:14:24,349
I'm sorry.

183
00:14:25,628 --> 00:14:26,768
Silly girl.

184
00:14:28,181 --> 00:14:30,371
I'm the one who should apologize.

185
00:14:33,036 --> 00:14:34,426
I'm sorry.

186
00:14:35,678 --> 00:14:37,082
Don't blame yourself either.

187
00:14:37,685 --> 00:14:40,682
All these years, you've been hiding our marriage.

188
00:14:40,884 --> 00:14:42,837
It's because you hoped we could live a normal life

189
00:14:42,861 --> 00:14:45,161
and that Yue wouldn't be affected.

190
00:14:47,972 --> 00:14:50,322
Once your mom heard about your car accident on the phone,

191
00:14:50,468 --> 00:14:53,858
she dropped everything at the show and came directly to the hospital.

192
00:14:56,285 --> 00:14:58,364
Mom, I'm fine.

193
00:14:58,501 --> 00:14:59,501
It's true.

194
00:15:01,436 --> 00:15:02,682
I'm glad you're fine.

195
00:15:09,222 --> 00:15:10,899
Miss, I'm sorry.

196
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,162
Someone called me on the phone at the time.

197
00:15:13,273 --> 00:15:15,873
I'm just a delivery driver. I really don't have money.

198
00:15:15,954 --> 00:15:18,200
- Please forgive me. - All right.

199
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,162
Fortunately, she's okay.

200
00:15:20,589 --> 00:15:22,922
We don't want to dwell on other matters.

201
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:25,002
Thank you.

202
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,860
Wait.

203
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,642
Sir.

204
00:15:30,085 --> 00:15:32,405
You know you can't talk on the phone while driving, right?

205
00:15:33,643 --> 00:15:35,474
I'm fine today because I was lucky.

206
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:38,490
But if you had hit an elderly person with health issues,

207
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:40,442
the consequences would be disastrous.

208
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:43,273
So, you need to take responsibility for this incident.

209
00:15:44,115 --> 00:15:46,755
Didn't you say you wouldn't dwell on this?

210
00:15:46,938 --> 00:15:49,488
That's what my mom said. It doesn't represent my will.

211
00:15:49,977 --> 00:15:52,562
Are you still trying to evade responsibility at this point?

212
00:15:52,746 --> 00:15:56,327
Let me tell you, you must compensate me fully for the damages.

213
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:10,240
Yue, if there's anything you need or want to eat or drink,

214
00:16:10,321 --> 00:16:12,401
just tell your uncle here, and he'll get it for you.

215
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,962
Thank you, Auntie.

216
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,050
Have a seat.

217
00:16:25,425 --> 00:16:26,425
Sit.

218
00:16:27,838 --> 00:16:30,750
So, you're Yue's lecturer?

219
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,059
Not really.

220
00:16:36,438 --> 00:16:38,749
Yue just comes to my classes often.

221
00:16:39,956 --> 00:16:40,975
Often?

222
00:16:51,124 --> 00:16:52,162
You're good.

223
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,730
You make Yue voluntarily attend the classes.

224
00:17:05,697 --> 00:17:07,340
I need to go to the office to handle the matter.

225
00:17:07,364 --> 00:17:08,664
You can go home first.

226
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:11,039
Huai Man.

227
00:17:12,837 --> 00:17:14,867
About what I said earlier today...

228
00:17:15,344 --> 00:17:16,349
I'm sorry.

229
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:20,099
I don't know that you're Shi Yan's sister and Yue's mother.

230
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,082
Never mind.

231
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,740
You didn't know about this.

232
00:17:25,969 --> 00:17:27,122
But...

233
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:29,524
Shi Yan never told you?

234
00:17:37,159 --> 00:17:38,962
- Bye, Sister. - Bye.

235
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,722
What's wrong?

236
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,079
You had the nerve to ask.

237
00:18:00,164 --> 00:18:01,842
You're single this second.

238
00:18:04,305 --> 00:18:05,540
Shu Yi.

239
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,002
Are you angry?

240
00:18:18,324 --> 00:18:21,354
Let's discuss this when we get home.

241
00:18:22,675 --> 00:18:24,002
I don't have a home.

242
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,442
I didn't tell you this in the first place

243
00:18:29,523 --> 00:18:32,082
because I wanted to surprise you.

244
00:18:33,642 --> 00:18:34,642
Is that so?

245
00:18:34,763 --> 00:18:36,071
What a surprise.

246
00:18:36,152 --> 00:18:37,291
Surprise!

247
00:18:45,141 --> 00:18:46,522
What are you thinking about?

248
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,109
I'm wondering if the recycling center will accept my unwanted boyfriend.

249
00:18:57,101 --> 00:18:58,140
It's getting late.

250
00:18:58,252 --> 00:18:59,252
Let's go home.

251
00:19:00,009 --> 00:19:03,082
You're right. It's getting late. It's time to go home.

252
00:19:05,527 --> 00:19:06,527
Let's go.

253
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:19,735
Why are you following me?

254
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,860
Nothing.

255
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:24,158
I'm planning to sleep on pink bed sheets.

256
00:19:25,078 --> 00:19:27,028
Did I invite you to spend the night at my place?

257
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,440
What should I do then?

258
00:19:31,251 --> 00:19:32,891
You really don't want to go home with me?

259
00:19:36,564 --> 00:19:37,587
No.

260
00:19:38,163 --> 00:19:41,345
Shi Yan, let me tell you. I care a lot about my reputation.

261
00:19:41,454 --> 00:19:43,355
You embarrassed me in front of my idol.

262
00:19:43,436 --> 00:19:44,602
I won't forgive you!

263
00:19:55,356 --> 00:19:56,456
Out of power?

264
00:20:01,892 --> 00:20:03,242
(Where is my key?)

265
00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:06,282
What's the matter?

266
00:20:07,014 --> 00:20:08,362
Are you praying again?

267
00:20:33,555 --> 00:20:35,383
(Family matters should be kept private.)

268
00:20:35,464 --> 00:20:37,922
(Shan Shan will definitely laugh at me if I tell her.)

269
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:40,362
(But this bad guy is not saying anything.)

270
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:43,619
(If I don't knock on the door, I would be even more embarrassed.)

271
00:20:52,202 --> 00:20:53,202
You...

272
00:20:54,872 --> 00:20:56,302
You guys...

273
00:21:02,966 --> 00:21:05,226
Honey, who is it?

274
00:21:10,317 --> 00:21:11,490
Shan Shan.

275
00:21:11,661 --> 00:21:12,922
It's him?

276
00:21:13,286 --> 00:21:14,371
Didn't you say...

277
00:21:14,452 --> 00:21:17,122
Why don't you come in first? I'll tell you slowly.

278
00:21:23,326 --> 00:21:24,642
Shu Yi.

279
00:21:25,062 --> 00:21:26,242
You've met her.

280
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:27,395
It's getting late.

281
00:21:27,476 --> 00:21:28,762
Let's go home.

282
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:31,848
We'll visit again next time. I'll take her back now.

283
00:21:31,872 --> 00:21:33,640
Okay, come again next time.

284
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:52,459
- What do you want to eat tonight? - I don't want to eat.

285
00:21:52,483 --> 00:21:53,552
I have no appetite.

286
00:21:53,639 --> 00:21:54,639
Really?

287
00:21:54,887 --> 00:21:58,311
I don't know when I'll have time to cook again.

288
00:22:03,967 --> 00:22:05,282
Are you making amends to me?

289
00:22:07,324 --> 00:22:08,324
May I?

290
00:22:09,114 --> 00:22:10,745
That depends on your cooking skills.

291
00:22:11,903 --> 00:22:13,602
It's not like you never tried before.

292
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,042
What do you want to eat?

293
00:22:15,887 --> 00:22:17,169
A full-course Chinese meal.

294
00:22:25,342 --> 00:22:26,522
Let's dig in.

295
00:22:29,923 --> 00:22:31,803
I'm not very hungry.

296
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:34,744
If it tastes bad, I won't compromise.

297
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:04,221
I'll let this slide.

298
00:23:04,302 --> 00:23:05,828
If you dare to lie to me again,

299
00:23:05,909 --> 00:23:08,882
even if you become a Michelin chef, I won't forgive you.

300
00:23:11,903 --> 00:23:13,802
I didn't really lie to you.

301
00:23:13,886 --> 00:23:17,916
I never said that Song Yue Lan is not my sister.

302
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,655
You knew that I like her so much,

303
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:22,042
but you didn't even tell me.

304
00:23:22,141 --> 00:23:24,691
It's such a big deal and you didn't mention it at all.

305
00:23:28,117 --> 00:23:29,642
Did I not mention it?

306
00:23:30,215 --> 00:23:34,154
Last time when we had noodles, didn't I ask if you wanted to talk to her?

307
00:23:38,824 --> 00:23:40,609
Do you want to greet my sister?

308
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:43,162
Your sister doesn't work at Mingyu.

309
00:23:43,329 --> 00:23:44,522
What does she do?

310
00:23:44,816 --> 00:23:45,837
She

311
00:23:46,922 --> 00:23:48,858
just sings and dances every day.

312
00:23:48,939 --> 00:23:50,122
Nothing much.

313
00:23:53,535 --> 00:23:54,802
Shi Yan!

314
00:23:55,738 --> 00:23:56,962
What's the matter?

315
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,591
You're so annoying.

316
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,642
You don't want to eat?

317
00:24:20,605 --> 00:24:21,705
Shu Yi.

318
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:27,202
Shu Yi, are you asleep?

319
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,551
There's a big sofa in the living room.

320
00:24:29,575 --> 00:24:30,859
There are soft pillows in the guest room.

321
00:24:30,883 --> 00:24:32,064
You choose.

322
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:39,160
(Really?)

323
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,722
(Song Yue Lan is actually Shi Yan's biological sister?)

324
00:24:42,803 --> 00:24:44,002
It's true.

325
00:24:44,098 --> 00:24:45,389
But you should calm down.

326
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:47,202
You're blasting my eardrums.

327
00:24:49,591 --> 00:24:51,082
You may not believe it if I tell you.

328
00:24:51,165 --> 00:24:52,596
I only found out today.

329
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:56,442
That's right. I'm locking him out now.

330
00:24:56,573 --> 00:24:59,362
He can't come in until my anger subsides.

331
00:25:06,294 --> 00:25:07,919
- Did I let you in? - Shu Yi...

332
00:25:08,062 --> 00:25:09,842
Get out! You...

333
00:25:20,526 --> 00:25:22,282
What can I do to make you forgive me?

334
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:28,842
Say something.

335
00:25:29,286 --> 00:25:31,206
(This is simple.)

336
00:25:31,287 --> 00:25:34,356
(Just do it, don't be a coward, Mr. Shi.)

337
00:26:21,442 --> 00:26:23,842
Guan Ji, stop it.

338
00:26:24,006 --> 00:26:25,522
Spare Shan Shan.

339
00:26:26,708 --> 00:26:28,899
Yue, how can you say that?

340
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:31,130
I know,

341
00:26:31,216 --> 00:26:33,362
Shan Shan is pretty and kind.

342
00:26:33,475 --> 00:26:34,642
But Guan Ji,

343
00:26:34,755 --> 00:26:36,518
you know what kind of person you are.

344
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:37,897
Let go of her hand now!

345
00:26:38,735 --> 00:26:41,242
Shan Shan, stay away from him.

346
00:26:41,826 --> 00:26:43,002
What kind of person am I?

347
00:26:43,153 --> 00:26:46,002
We are deeply in love with each other.

348
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,170
It's impossible for me to stay away from her.

349
00:26:49,766 --> 00:26:51,356
We'll only get closer and closer.

350
00:26:55,231 --> 00:26:56,722
It's over.

351
00:26:57,013 --> 00:26:59,122
Good cabbage is being eaten by a pig.

352
00:26:59,591 --> 00:27:01,759
What did you say? Who is the cabbage?

353
00:27:01,854 --> 00:27:03,042
Who is a pig?

354
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,202
No, I have to call Shu Yi.

355
00:27:07,114 --> 00:27:08,703
I need to protect Shan Shan.

356
00:27:08,784 --> 00:27:11,014
We can't let her fall into your trap, you womanizer.

357
00:27:11,604 --> 00:27:13,834
I'm the one who should be protected now.

358
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,599
I've already been claimed by Shan Shan.

359
00:27:16,903 --> 00:27:18,003
She's got me.

360
00:27:18,117 --> 00:27:19,362
Now, I'm the one

361
00:27:19,907 --> 00:27:21,082
who can't live without her.

362
00:27:22,231 --> 00:27:23,869
Oh my god.

363
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,122
Is this still the Guan Ji I know?

364
00:27:26,388 --> 00:27:27,527
Shan Shan.

365
00:27:29,238 --> 00:27:30,642
You're a master.

366
00:27:31,125 --> 00:27:33,914
When it comes to love, there's no master or loser.

367
00:27:34,542 --> 00:27:35,922
It's just

368
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:38,642
a matter of meeting someone you truly like.

369
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:41,802
And no one can escape that.

370
00:27:44,739 --> 00:27:46,722
No one believed me when I said it.

371
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,473
I actually worked with Song Yue Lan's daughter for several months.

372
00:27:49,497 --> 00:27:50,897
- Really? - Yes, it's that Song Yue Lan.

373
00:27:50,921 --> 00:27:52,522
Yes, why is her daughter working here?

374
00:27:52,605 --> 00:27:53,767
I have no idea.

375
00:27:53,848 --> 00:27:57,002
- Oh my god. - How do they even know this?

376
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:59,558
Do you think this is still the era of 2G networks?

377
00:27:59,655 --> 00:28:01,095
People can find out anything online.

378
00:28:01,231 --> 00:28:04,300
Now, who doesn't know that Qin Shi Yue is Song Yue Lan's daughter?

379
00:28:09,975 --> 00:28:11,602
Do I have something on my face?

380
00:28:12,842 --> 00:28:15,279
Shu Yi, your boyfriend is Shi Yan.

381
00:28:15,375 --> 00:28:17,122
He's Song Yue Lan's biological brother.

382
00:28:18,726 --> 00:28:19,962
How do you know about this?

383
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,002
Yu Ling told us before.

384
00:28:23,083 --> 00:28:25,602
You're dating Qin Shi Yue's uncle.

385
00:28:25,719 --> 00:28:29,122
Qin Shi Yue's uncle is Shi Yan, right?

386
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:33,002
It's real.

387
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,630
Indeed.

388
00:28:37,126 --> 00:28:38,922
I know what you want to ask.

389
00:28:39,757 --> 00:28:41,827
She went to Xuyi.

390
00:28:44,911 --> 00:28:47,562
She's flexible and has leadership skills.

391
00:28:47,838 --> 00:28:50,278
Maybe she will have better career development at Xuyi.

392
00:28:50,949 --> 00:28:52,229
You're really generous.

393
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:54,580
You're still wishing for her to have better development?

394
00:29:00,443 --> 00:29:02,643
It seems that Shi Yan is good at taking care of people.

395
00:29:02,934 --> 00:29:04,322
You look fine.

396
00:29:05,556 --> 00:29:06,556
Not bad.

397
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,602
If you have gotten enough rest, get back to work.

398
00:29:14,966 --> 00:29:17,635
Do you have any other plans now?

399
00:29:18,726 --> 00:29:19,879
No.

400
00:29:20,082 --> 00:29:21,110
Don't worry, Ms. Yi.

401
00:29:21,191 --> 00:29:23,100
I love my job very much.

402
00:29:24,747 --> 00:29:27,063
The special feature on Yunchuang and the entrepreneurship of returnees

403
00:29:27,087 --> 00:29:28,347
received rave reviews before.

404
00:29:28,718 --> 00:29:30,598
Your abilities are well recognized by everyone.

405
00:29:30,813 --> 00:29:32,482
During the meeting a few days ago,

406
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:34,482
the editor-in-chief even praised you.

407
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,371
That's because you lead me well.

408
00:29:40,516 --> 00:29:41,695
Get ready.

409
00:29:42,493 --> 00:29:43,493
For what?

410
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:47,399
You need to start building a team specially for convergence media.

411
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,642
Zheng Shu Yi, your chance has come.

412
00:29:50,099 --> 00:29:51,318
Seize it.

413
00:29:52,114 --> 00:29:53,119
Don't worry, Ms. Yi.

414
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,459
I'll do a good job in media convergence

415
00:29:54,483 --> 00:29:56,123
and make it likable to readers worldwide.

416
00:30:05,411 --> 00:30:06,411
Come.

417
00:30:08,505 --> 00:30:09,800
I'm not slacking off.

418
00:30:09,926 --> 00:30:11,956
I just felt uncomfortable holding it.

419
00:30:17,659 --> 00:30:18,759
Let me hold it for you.

420
00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:21,299
If there's anything you don't know, you can ask me directly.

421
00:30:23,725 --> 00:30:25,476
When you feel tired, lean on me.

422
00:30:37,277 --> 00:30:39,706
She finally found someone who can control her.

423
00:30:41,287 --> 00:30:42,842
Yu You is good.

424
00:30:43,867 --> 00:30:45,458
He's good to Yue too.

425
00:30:47,275 --> 00:30:49,242
You should be relieved, right?

426
00:30:56,309 --> 00:30:57,682
I thought you wouldn't come.

427
00:30:58,435 --> 00:30:59,720
I'm a professional journalist.

428
00:30:59,801 --> 00:31:02,082
I'll try to seize all news opportunities.

429
00:31:03,769 --> 00:31:04,769
Good.

430
00:31:05,233 --> 00:31:06,522
Let's get to the point.

431
00:31:06,684 --> 00:31:08,473
The collaboration between Dark Horse and Le'an is imminent.

432
00:31:08,497 --> 00:31:11,282
The key technology of mmWave chips is experiencing a breakthrough.

433
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:13,962
I would like to ask you to do an exclusive interview about this.

434
00:31:14,049 --> 00:31:15,722
This breakthrough is revolutionary.

435
00:31:15,926 --> 00:31:18,362
I broke all the barriers to facilitate this collaboration.

436
00:31:18,512 --> 00:31:21,242
It's because I don't want everyone's efforts to go to waste.

437
00:31:21,348 --> 00:31:23,668
This collaboration is worth being documented and reported.

438
00:31:25,328 --> 00:31:27,242
Mr. Yi, you're brave enough to challenge and innovate.

439
00:31:27,266 --> 00:31:29,135
It's indeed worthy of learning and admiration.

440
00:31:29,558 --> 00:31:32,642
But without Shi Yan, this collaboration wouldn't have been possible.

441
00:31:32,903 --> 00:31:36,322
It was his wisdom and vision that broke the deadlock,

442
00:31:36,481 --> 00:31:38,921
came up with a win-win collaboration and convinced Chen Kang,

443
00:31:38,986 --> 00:31:40,522
which led to the current outcome.

444
00:31:40,786 --> 00:31:43,266
The value and significance of this feature are unquestionable.

445
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:46,020
Financial Introduce wouldn't want to miss this opportunity either.

446
00:31:46,998 --> 00:31:48,082
But Mr. Yi,

447
00:31:48,309 --> 00:31:51,002
I'm definitely not the best choice for this feature.

448
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:54,882
Shu Yi, I know your talents and abilities.

449
00:31:54,963 --> 00:31:57,362
I hope this interview can be conducted by you personally.

450
00:31:58,875 --> 00:31:59,962
As you said,

451
00:32:00,106 --> 00:32:01,205
a good feature

452
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:04,013
encapsulates the efforts and contributions of more than one person.

453
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,682
Our magazine has many outstanding journalists.

454
00:32:06,913 --> 00:32:08,132
You can trust them.

455
00:32:13,317 --> 00:32:14,317
Okay.

456
00:32:14,585 --> 00:32:15,802
I trust you.

457
00:32:16,148 --> 00:32:17,948
I'll leave it to your colleagues.

458
00:32:18,232 --> 00:32:21,122
I believe Dark Horses will also use technology to change our lives.

459
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,711
You won't let us down.

460
00:32:38,761 --> 00:32:40,604
(Isn't this your boyfriend?)

461
00:32:42,173 --> 00:32:43,522
(You saw it too?)

462
00:32:44,122 --> 00:32:46,887
(Internet is so advanced that people across the country know about this.)

463
00:32:46,911 --> 00:32:48,643
(Lately, people have been asking me about this.)

464
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:50,098
(It's so annoying.)

465
00:32:52,611 --> 00:32:54,402
(You're really into this.)

466
00:32:56,442 --> 00:32:59,153
(Mom, he's really my boyfriend!)

467
00:33:12,044 --> 00:33:13,554
Where is this?

468
00:33:27,333 --> 00:33:28,333
Shu Yi.

469
00:33:36,474 --> 00:33:37,474
(Hello?)

470
00:33:37,802 --> 00:33:38,802
Yi.

471
00:33:39,276 --> 00:33:40,642
You're still up?

472
00:33:40,986 --> 00:33:42,246
What are you doing?

473
00:33:43,675 --> 00:33:44,735
She's taking a shower.

474
00:33:47,691 --> 00:33:48,912
Who are you?

475
00:33:54,901 --> 00:33:56,282
Were you talking just now?

476
00:33:57,277 --> 00:33:58,522
I answered a call.

477
00:34:00,332 --> 00:34:01,682
I answered your call.

478
00:34:02,636 --> 00:34:04,316
Who was calling me? Ms. Tang?

479
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:05,550
Your mom.

480
00:34:07,651 --> 00:34:08,951
What did my mom tell you?

481
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:12,179
She asked you to wait a little longer.

482
00:34:12,286 --> 00:34:14,162
She's on her way to find

483
00:34:14,356 --> 00:34:15,656
your stepfather.

484
00:34:30,572 --> 00:34:32,451
Why did you call me so late at night?

485
00:34:32,532 --> 00:34:34,002
(Are you getting impatient?)

486
00:34:34,147 --> 00:34:36,747
(I just want to ask you if you're coming home on the 1st of May.)

487
00:34:39,701 --> 00:34:42,451
I know what you want to say, but I told you I don't want it.

488
00:34:47,478 --> 00:34:48,522
What's wrong?

489
00:34:48,777 --> 00:34:50,037
Are you free on the 1st of May?

490
00:34:52,834 --> 00:34:53,834
No,

491
00:34:55,366 --> 00:34:56,722
but I'll make time for you.

492
00:34:59,276 --> 00:35:02,002
Can you finish your sentence at one go the next time you talk?

493
00:35:04,713 --> 00:35:06,722
I know, let me check my schedule.

494
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:09,171
I have a lot on my plate recently. I'll go home if I'm not busy.

495
00:35:09,195 --> 00:35:10,545
I'll let you know then.

496
00:35:18,472 --> 00:35:19,602
What are you looking at?

497
00:35:19,698 --> 00:35:21,362
Is the book as good as me?

498
00:35:37,399 --> 00:35:38,962
Wouldn't it be too plain?

499
00:35:39,498 --> 00:35:41,922
Will they think I'm too old-fashioned?

500
00:35:43,059 --> 00:35:44,922
Maybe I should go back and change.

501
00:35:46,365 --> 00:35:47,922
I think it looks good.

502
00:35:48,487 --> 00:35:50,722
It doesn't matter whether you think it's good or not.

503
00:35:50,803 --> 00:35:53,282
God knows what impression I have on your sister.

504
00:35:53,409 --> 00:35:55,289
I can't leave a bad impression on your dad too.

505
00:35:56,175 --> 00:35:58,122
I like you and they must like you too.

506
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,220
So, relax a little and don't be nervous.

507
00:36:01,212 --> 00:36:02,402
What did you say?

508
00:36:02,877 --> 00:36:04,139
I said we're just here for a meal.

509
00:36:04,163 --> 00:36:06,202
Just relax and don't be nervous.

510
00:36:06,635 --> 00:36:07,694
Not this sentence.

511
00:36:09,413 --> 00:36:10,413
Let's go in.

512
00:36:10,971 --> 00:36:11,971
Say it.

513
00:36:12,052 --> 00:36:13,052
Previous sentence.

514
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,050
I like you.

515
00:36:19,402 --> 00:36:20,753
I like you too.

516
00:36:21,515 --> 00:36:22,515
Let's go.

517
00:36:28,009 --> 00:36:29,642
Dad, Sister.

518
00:36:34,589 --> 00:36:37,070
This is my girlfriend, Zheng Shu Yi.

519
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,800
Hello, Uncle. Hello, Huai Man.

520
00:36:41,001 --> 00:36:44,402
- Hello. - We've been waiting for Shi Yan to bring you home.

521
00:36:44,699 --> 00:36:45,962
Don't stand there.

522
00:36:46,377 --> 00:36:47,377
Have a seat.

523
00:36:47,737 --> 00:36:48,737
Sit down.

524
00:36:53,306 --> 00:36:55,810
Huai Man, please tell me more.

525
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:59,635
Shi Yan has got too much pride since he was a child.

526
00:36:59,752 --> 00:37:01,002
No matter what you ask him,

527
00:37:01,147 --> 00:37:02,407
he always will be...

528
00:37:04,551 --> 00:37:06,971
I know, right? Now he's like that too.

529
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,322
I call him uh-huh weirdo.

530
00:37:18,067 --> 00:37:19,802
Shu Yi, have some fruit.

531
00:37:22,027 --> 00:37:23,250
I'm back.

532
00:37:23,331 --> 00:37:25,042
Grandpa, Mom, Uncle.

533
00:37:25,706 --> 00:37:26,806
Auntie.

534
00:37:36,875 --> 00:37:38,442
You haven't seen our yard, right?

535
00:37:38,512 --> 00:37:40,002
Come, I'll take you around.

536
00:37:40,618 --> 00:37:42,127
I'll check it out with Yue.

537
00:37:43,259 --> 00:37:45,002
Go take a look and get to know the way.

538
00:37:45,106 --> 00:37:47,042
Auntie.

539
00:37:49,217 --> 00:37:50,402
Let's go.

540
00:37:51,343 --> 00:37:52,602
Sister.

541
00:37:53,367 --> 00:37:56,762
How does it feel now that the whole world knows who you are?

542
00:37:57,649 --> 00:37:59,282
I just want to focus on my work.

543
00:37:59,438 --> 00:38:02,082
I told them, but my dad and uncle didn't believe it.

544
00:38:02,766 --> 00:38:04,442
Others' opinions don't matter.

545
00:38:04,516 --> 00:38:06,682
It's more important to do what you like.

546
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,002
People can't live their whole lives based on others' opinions.

547
00:38:10,026 --> 00:38:12,886
And I already know what I like.

548
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:17,485
I can't believe those words came out of your mouth.

549
00:38:18,391 --> 00:38:20,141
Indeed, it wasn't me who said them.

550
00:38:21,306 --> 00:38:22,327
Yu You?

551
00:38:29,845 --> 00:38:31,362
It's full of color, flavor and taste.

552
00:38:31,628 --> 00:38:34,538
Shi Yan is so blessed.

553
00:38:36,242 --> 00:38:37,442
You're back.

554
00:38:42,162 --> 00:38:43,162
Mom?

555
00:38:46,205 --> 00:38:47,205
Why?

556
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,940
You hadn't seen me for months and you don't recognize me anymore?

557
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,393
How did you come back together?

558
00:38:54,507 --> 00:38:55,807
We met at the airport.

559
00:39:00,606 --> 00:39:02,707
You cooked?

560
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,522
Auntie, you guys talk first.

561
00:39:11,456 --> 00:39:13,383
Why did you come here without saying anything?

562
00:39:13,563 --> 00:39:16,110
If I told you in advance, this wouldn't be a surprise check.

563
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:19,522
Seems like it's a common problem for teachers.

564
00:39:21,677 --> 00:39:23,117
You two haven't met before, right?

565
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,520
Why did you come back together?

566
00:39:26,605 --> 00:39:28,042
We never met.

567
00:39:28,363 --> 00:39:29,722
But I saw his photo.

568
00:39:29,902 --> 00:39:31,362
Didn't you send it to me before?

569
00:39:32,094 --> 00:39:34,842
I recognized him immediately at the airport,

570
00:39:34,904 --> 00:39:36,295
so we came back together.

571
00:39:38,985 --> 00:39:40,263
But you...

572
00:39:40,525 --> 00:39:44,034
You're living in his house without even telling your mother.

573
00:39:46,399 --> 00:39:49,518
In my third year of high school, you went to Singapore without telling me.

574
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,442
You told me you were going to Niupengpo.

575
00:39:52,785 --> 00:39:54,045
This isn't the same.

576
00:40:04,681 --> 00:40:07,590
Is this what you usually eat?

577
00:40:13,227 --> 00:40:14,282
It's okay.

578
00:40:14,344 --> 00:40:16,282
It's better than ordering takeout.

579
00:40:18,387 --> 00:40:20,687
We don't really eat this. I usually cook.

580
00:40:24,264 --> 00:40:25,574
It must be hard.

581
00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:27,799
It's my pleasure.

582
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,882
(I've only eaten a few meals you cooked.)

583
00:40:38,944 --> 00:40:40,682
(Why are you so thick-skinned?)

584
00:40:42,737 --> 00:40:44,717
Mom, you're leaving now?

585
00:40:46,366 --> 00:40:47,402
Yi.

586
00:40:47,942 --> 00:40:50,322
I saw how well Shi Yan treated you.

587
00:40:50,539 --> 00:40:51,882
I'm relieved.

588
00:40:52,081 --> 00:40:54,282
I have to rush back to Qing'an tonight.

589
00:40:54,548 --> 00:40:56,137
I have classes tomorrow morning.

590
00:40:57,013 --> 00:40:58,442
I won't disturb you.

591
00:40:59,852 --> 00:41:00,953
Mom.

592
00:41:05,478 --> 00:41:07,488
(You're still laughing at a time like this.)

593
00:41:07,569 --> 00:41:08,922
(Are you even a human?)

594
00:41:09,723 --> 00:41:11,524
Auntie, I'll send you off.

595
00:41:15,373 --> 00:41:16,394
I'm back.

596
00:41:17,126 --> 00:41:20,009
That's not right. Qing'an is a small city without an airport.

597
00:41:20,105 --> 00:41:21,264
My mother came to see me.

598
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:23,825
She shouldn't have landed at Jiangcheng International Airport.

599
00:41:24,385 --> 00:41:27,562
Didn't you go to the airport to pick up the technical expert from France?

600
00:41:27,643 --> 00:41:29,313
How did you meet her at the airport?

601
00:41:31,415 --> 00:41:33,655
Auntie and her friend just returned from Southeast Asia.

602
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,027
They needed to transfer to the high-speed rail in Jiangcheng

603
00:41:35,051 --> 00:41:36,212
to return to Qing'an.

604
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:41,030
You two...

605
00:41:49,118 --> 00:41:50,118
Shi Yan

606
00:41:50,603 --> 00:41:54,545
actually helped Le'an and Dark Horse collaborate to share the results.

607
00:41:55,213 --> 00:41:57,549
He let Dark Horse take a piece of the pie for no reason.

608
00:41:58,004 --> 00:42:00,402
He's toying with our money.

609
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:03,053
I wonder how he sweet talked Fei Fei.

610
00:42:03,134 --> 00:42:04,534
Fei Fei also played along with him.

611
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:06,196
I'm telling you, we can't let this go on.

612
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:08,529
Let's go talk to Wen Guang. Let him make a decision.

613
00:42:08,617 --> 00:42:09,617
Right.

614
00:42:11,627 --> 00:42:12,882
Wen Guang.

615
00:42:13,035 --> 00:42:18,345
We didn't want to disturb you either, but look at what Shi Yan has done.

616
00:42:19,467 --> 00:42:21,842
He pulled strings for Le'an and Dark Horse

617
00:42:21,927 --> 00:42:24,802
and let Dark Horse benefit from Le'an's technological achievements.

618
00:42:25,298 --> 00:42:27,518
Is this what an investor should do?

619
00:42:28,737 --> 00:42:31,158
This is unheard of and unseen for me.

620
00:42:31,379 --> 00:42:33,599
I think he joined the wrong field.

621
00:42:33,803 --> 00:42:35,633
You should let him do charity work.

622
00:42:36,477 --> 00:42:38,042
You haven't heard of it, right?

623
00:42:38,123 --> 00:42:40,937
Guan Ji is not good either.

624
00:42:41,236 --> 00:42:43,050
We're all in a mess.

625
00:42:43,242 --> 00:42:45,482
But he won't handle it together with Shi Yan.

626
00:42:45,635 --> 00:42:47,664
He's even sending a horse to the girl.

627
00:42:48,122 --> 00:42:49,982
You know what people are saying now?

628
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:53,282
What did they say?

629
00:42:58,644 --> 00:43:02,693
(Shi Yan is too young and has poor vision, which led to such a fiasco.)

630
00:43:02,934 --> 00:43:05,478
(Something went wrong with Yunchuang's post-investment management.)

631
00:43:05,502 --> 00:43:06,850
(They exposed themselves to danger.)

632
00:43:06,874 --> 00:43:10,322
(Bruce was poached and Le'an was forced to cooperate with Dark Horse.)

633
00:43:13,428 --> 00:43:14,738
Look at this too.

634
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,160
(With the help of Yunchuang, )

635
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,882
(Le'an and Dark Horse officially announce collaboration.)

636
00:43:21,943 --> 00:43:23,503
(The investment company behind Le'an, )

637
00:43:23,576 --> 00:43:26,322
(Mingyu Yunchuang, has been questioned by many parties.)

638
00:43:26,388 --> 00:43:27,760
(The CEO of Dark Horse, Yi Yang, )

639
00:43:27,841 --> 00:43:30,962
(said he would choose the right media to disclose details to the public.)

640
00:43:31,084 --> 00:43:35,274
(However, the CEO of Mingyu Yunchuang, Mr. Shi, has not made any response.)

641
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:41,122
Wen Guang.

642
00:43:41,763 --> 00:43:43,849
We didn't want to bring up old matters,

643
00:43:43,958 --> 00:43:45,710
but you have to make a decision.

644
00:43:45,919 --> 00:43:47,362
We can't let this go on.

645
00:43:47,567 --> 00:43:49,322
Shi Yan is making mistakes repeatedly,

646
00:43:49,442 --> 00:43:51,762
and Yunchuang will be ruined by him sooner or later.

647
00:43:52,025 --> 00:43:53,325
Do you think this will work?

648
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:57,242
Let Xiao Ming manage Yunchuang.

649
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:05,326
(The investment company behind Le'an, Mingyu Yunchuang, )

650
00:44:05,407 --> 00:44:07,122
(has been questioned by many parties.)

651
00:44:14,002 --> 00:44:16,897
Mr. Shi, many media have invited you for an interview.

652
00:44:16,978 --> 00:44:18,423
They hope you can share your thoughts

653
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:20,540
on the collaboration between Le'an and Dark Horse.

654
00:44:21,187 --> 00:44:22,362
Turn them down.
