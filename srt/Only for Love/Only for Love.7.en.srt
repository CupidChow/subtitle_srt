00:01:31,002 --> 00:01:35,960
(Only For Love)

2
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:39,002
(Episode 7)

3
00:01:54,341 --> 00:01:56,100
It's so late now.

4
00:01:56,181 --> 00:01:58,101
So what if it doesn't get approved?

5
00:01:58,182 --> 00:01:59,941
What are we waiting for here?

6
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:03,533
What can we do? We work in the news business. We have to be rigorous.

7
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,251
We agreed to wait until 12 am, it has to be 12 am sharp, not a minute less.

8
00:02:08,565 --> 00:02:10,205
Even the editor is waiting,

9
00:02:10,286 --> 00:02:12,077
so why are you complaining?

10
00:02:16,214 --> 00:02:18,075
How's it going? Did he reply to you?

11
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:22,173
He said he'd get back to me today.

12
00:02:22,328 --> 00:02:23,669
I trust him.

13
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:33,790
(Mr. Shi, at this moment, )

14
00:02:33,917 --> 00:02:37,107
(everyone at our magazine is gathered here, waiting for your response.)

15
00:02:37,284 --> 00:02:39,405
(This isn't just about you or me.)

16
00:02:39,494 --> 00:02:42,741
(The publication of an issue involves a lot of people's hard work.)

17
00:02:42,822 --> 00:02:45,160
(Workers at the printing plant are still waiting.)

18
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:47,835
(If you decide not to approve the manuscript, it's okay, )

19
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:49,396
(but please provide a clear response.)

20
00:02:49,501 --> 00:02:51,770
(Other colleagues' articles can take its place.)

21
00:02:52,266 --> 00:02:53,665
(If I get a reply from you, )

22
00:02:53,768 --> 00:02:55,688
(I'll pay you a visit to express my gratitude.)

23
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,411
(Once again, I sincerely request you to reply as soon as possible.)

24
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,160
(Manuscript approved!)

25
00:03:32,101 --> 00:03:33,810
Everyone, pull yourselves together.

26
00:03:35,941 --> 00:03:38,465
The interview manuscript with Shi Yan has been approved.

27
00:03:45,237 --> 00:03:46,717
You've all worked hard.

28
00:03:46,888 --> 00:03:47,888
Hang in there a little longer

29
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,631
and finish up the remaining tasks.

30
00:03:49,712 --> 00:03:51,432
Yes! Congratulations, Shu Yi!

31
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:54,090
- Congratulations, Shu Yi!   - Congratulations, Shu Yi! Buy us meal!

32
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:05,339
- I'll take my leave now.   - Bye.

33
00:04:09,601 --> 00:04:11,000
(Thank you, Mr. Chen.)

34
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,560
(Thanks for your hard work.)

35
00:04:14,996 --> 00:04:17,157
(Don't mention it. Well, my boss is also working late.)

36
00:04:17,261 --> 00:04:18,641
(He's working harder than me.)

37
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,541
(Thank you, Mr. Shi.)

38
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,354
(You've worked hard, Mr. Shi.)

39
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,282
There was an unsubscribe yesterday.

40
00:04:40,401 --> 00:04:42,581
Why is there no response today?

41
00:04:45,245 --> 00:04:48,778
Does he have a thing for cheesy pickup lines?

42
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,759
You ever heard "men are forever young"?

43
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,082
When men want to be pretentious,

44
00:05:10,163 --> 00:05:11,792
they can do it better than women.

45
00:05:11,873 --> 00:05:14,113
Haven't you read those domineering CEO romance stories?

46
00:05:14,222 --> 00:05:16,900
The more he likes you, the more he tries to deny it.

47
00:05:16,997 --> 00:05:18,950
The more he likes you, the more he'll tease and provoke you.

48
00:05:19,031 --> 00:05:20,842
Shi Yan is exactly that kind of guy.

49
00:05:38,324 --> 00:05:39,459
(Rainy days with Wen, )

50
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,940
(stormy days with Yan Zi, )

51
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,380
(sunny days with Jie, )

52
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,450
(none of them compare to chatting with you.)

53
00:05:44,531 --> 00:05:47,162
(Today, just as always, I'm flirting with you.)

54
00:05:47,334 --> 00:05:50,885
(Even if you ignore me today, I will still text you tomorrow.)

55
00:05:51,207 --> 00:05:53,453
(If you find my approach a bit cliche, I apologize, )

56
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,202
(but it's entirely intentional.)

57
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:21,769
(Let's meet at our usual spot tonight.)

58
00:06:24,161 --> 00:06:26,590
(I have plans tonight. Next time, maybe.)

59
00:06:33,214 --> 00:06:34,762
She still isn't here yet?

60
00:06:34,957 --> 00:06:37,478
Situ Yi is the same as when she was in college,

61
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,260
always late for everything.

62
00:06:39,623 --> 00:06:41,642
It's been over 30 minutes.

63
00:06:41,886 --> 00:06:44,642
Well, she's a famous beauty influencer now.

64
00:06:44,736 --> 00:06:46,445
She putting on airs is expected.

65
00:06:47,897 --> 00:06:50,427
Is it really this busy in the world of new media these days?

66
00:06:51,052 --> 00:06:52,332
But it does make sense.

67
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:53,924
It's making good money.

68
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:56,625
No wonder you've been thinking about digital publishing.

69
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:01,549
Sorry, I'm late. I had to upload a vlog today.

70
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,870
I just finished editing.

71
00:07:02,951 --> 00:07:05,372
Order anything you like, it's on me.

72
00:07:05,837 --> 00:07:08,507
You kept us waiting for so long. So, of course it's on you.

73
00:07:08,832 --> 00:07:09,851
Order away.

74
00:07:10,405 --> 00:07:11,926
It's been a long time, Situ Yi.

75
00:07:12,022 --> 00:07:13,062
You've changed a lot.

76
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,369
You've become more beautiful.

77
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:15,940
And you're still gorgeous as ever,

78
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,541
not much different from before.

79
00:07:17,621 --> 00:07:20,162
By the way, are you still with Financial Introduce?

80
00:07:20,352 --> 00:07:23,153
It's been three years since we graduated.

81
00:07:23,254 --> 00:07:26,274
You must be a deputy editor or editor by now.

82
00:07:26,566 --> 00:07:28,285
No. I'm still in my old role,

83
00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:29,917
working as a special features journalist.

84
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:32,701
Given how print media is struggling,

85
00:07:32,797 --> 00:07:34,277
I'm surprised you haven't switched.

86
00:07:34,357 --> 00:07:36,676
I thought you must have climbed up to the management level,

87
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:38,467
which is why you're reluctant to leave.

88
00:07:38,654 --> 00:07:39,893
Let me offer you some advice,

89
00:07:39,974 --> 00:07:42,324
it's high time to shift your focus to new media.

90
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,480
Well,

91
00:07:44,773 --> 00:07:46,372
we've actually been working on our digital version.

92
00:07:46,453 --> 00:07:48,293
I'm also contemplating how to refresh and upgrade it

93
00:07:48,393 --> 00:07:49,794
to make it more appealing to readers.

94
00:07:49,874 --> 00:07:52,333
A specific format or medium might wane,

95
00:07:52,432 --> 00:07:53,953
but excellent content never does.

96
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:55,393
Just as with your vlogs,

97
00:07:55,473 --> 00:07:56,953
video as a medium

98
00:07:57,033 --> 00:07:59,474
might eventually be supplanted by a newer one,

99
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:01,373
but as long as your content is first-rate

100
00:08:01,473 --> 00:08:03,890
and stays current, it won't become obsolete.

101
00:08:04,074 --> 00:08:05,107
Well said.

102
00:08:07,994 --> 00:08:10,234
These are the technical issues and challenges

103
00:08:10,314 --> 00:08:12,025
we're currently facing,

104
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:15,943
along with some of our thoughts on how to address them.

105
00:08:16,434 --> 00:08:18,132
So, we're hoping you can provide us

106
00:08:18,213 --> 00:08:21,343
with some technical support and guidance.

107
00:08:22,314 --> 00:08:24,264
You're already doing so well,

108
00:08:24,913 --> 00:08:27,255
but I suggest reevaluating

109
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:29,553
the time required to solve this problem,

110
00:08:30,114 --> 00:08:33,426
establishing a dedicated task force to tackle it,

111
00:08:33,533 --> 00:08:34,653
while other technical departments

112
00:08:34,736 --> 00:08:37,007
continue their exploration in different areas.

113
00:08:37,773 --> 00:08:40,853
I'd love to provide some insights during this process,

114
00:08:41,194 --> 00:08:44,343
but I still can't join Le'an.

115
00:08:44,473 --> 00:08:46,853
Your current team structure

116
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:51,583
doesn't quite match my expectations for technical development.

117
00:08:53,514 --> 00:08:55,264
I'm sorry to interrupt,

118
00:08:57,553 --> 00:09:00,272
but I still hope you will consider joining Le'an Technology,

119
00:09:00,353 --> 00:09:01,904
Professor Bruce.

120
00:09:02,514 --> 00:09:04,904
Yu You mentioned that you like challenges,

121
00:09:05,074 --> 00:09:07,303
but based on what you just said,

122
00:09:07,493 --> 00:09:10,474
achieving a breakthrough in this technology is only a matter of time.

123
00:09:10,554 --> 00:09:12,074
Bluntly put,

124
00:09:12,154 --> 00:09:13,434
given enough time,

125
00:09:13,514 --> 00:09:15,994
some other team will eventually accomplish it.

126
00:09:16,074 --> 00:09:17,314
Therefore, I believe

127
00:09:17,394 --> 00:09:20,463
this matter can't be solely referred to as a challenge.

128
00:09:20,914 --> 00:09:22,513
However, for Le'an Technology,

129
00:09:22,593 --> 00:09:24,673
all of this is exceedingly difficult,

130
00:09:24,753 --> 00:09:26,314
perhaps even, as you put it,

131
00:09:26,394 --> 00:09:27,714
"impossible."

132
00:09:27,794 --> 00:09:30,913
So, building an entirely new team in China

133
00:09:30,993 --> 00:09:33,043
and achieving a technological breakthrough

134
00:09:33,124 --> 00:09:34,793
within an impossibly short timeframe,

135
00:09:34,904 --> 00:09:37,214
now that's the real challenge.

136
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:38,973
Once we overcome this difficulty,

137
00:09:39,093 --> 00:09:42,114
we need to rapidly implement and put this technology

138
00:09:42,194 --> 00:09:43,673
into mass production and use.

139
00:09:43,832 --> 00:09:45,193
This series of challenges

140
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,553
isn't something any one person or team

141
00:09:47,633 --> 00:09:49,423
can easily accomplish.

142
00:09:50,873 --> 00:09:53,744
Personally, I find it full of fun and challenge.

143
00:09:53,914 --> 00:09:56,153
These are experiences you won't encounter

144
00:09:56,233 --> 00:09:59,014
in foreign labs or academic settings.

145
00:10:01,713 --> 00:10:05,632
But I can't accomplish all of this alone.

146
00:10:06,653 --> 00:10:08,815
I'll provide financial support,

147
00:10:09,113 --> 00:10:12,314
and I'll help Chen Kang build a top-notch team

148
00:10:12,394 --> 00:10:14,574
nationally, even globally.

149
00:10:14,693 --> 00:10:18,259
Next, it's up to you to accept the challenge.

150
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:25,434
Mr. Shi, what you've said today

151
00:10:25,514 --> 00:10:27,153
is certainly exciting,

152
00:10:27,233 --> 00:10:29,633
but this isn't a simple decision.

153
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:31,423
I need some time to think about it.

154
00:10:32,873 --> 00:10:33,994
Bruce,

155
00:10:34,074 --> 00:10:36,194
Shi Yan is an exceptional business partner.

156
00:10:36,274 --> 00:10:37,633
Challenging with him

157
00:10:37,713 --> 00:10:39,744
will bring you a different kind of fun.

158
00:10:39,967 --> 00:10:41,146
Plus,

159
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,114
he's a fantastic rock climber.

160
00:10:43,194 --> 00:10:44,703
You can try to beat him.

161
00:10:46,753 --> 00:10:48,774
This is really a major decision.

162
00:10:49,133 --> 00:10:50,772
I'll give you some time to think.

163
00:10:50,873 --> 00:10:52,423
But I'd like to say that,

164
00:10:52,593 --> 00:10:54,664
regardless of your decision,

165
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,943
I won't give up on my goal.

166
00:10:58,914 --> 00:11:00,253
By the way, Shu Yi,

167
00:11:00,353 --> 00:11:02,654
you're not still with Yue Xing Zhou, are you?

168
00:11:03,753 --> 00:11:05,054
We broke up.

169
00:11:05,353 --> 00:11:06,553
You really broke up?

170
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:08,653
It's all over the class group chat.

171
00:11:08,753 --> 00:11:10,544
Why act so surprised?

172
00:11:11,074 --> 00:11:12,633
Since you've broken up,

173
00:11:12,733 --> 00:11:14,284
I'll tell you something.

174
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,853
What is it?

175
00:11:16,034 --> 00:11:17,234
Back in college,

176
00:11:17,454 --> 00:11:19,664
didn't Yue Xing Zhou pursue you for a long time?

177
00:11:19,794 --> 00:11:21,033
Actually,

178
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:23,624
he was flirting with me at the same time.

179
00:11:23,794 --> 00:11:25,384
You probably didn't know that.

180
00:11:25,953 --> 00:11:27,253
What did you say?

181
00:11:27,473 --> 00:11:29,393
We were just flirting, that's all.

182
00:11:29,473 --> 00:11:31,753
To put it bluntly, I was just his backup.

183
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,434
Whenever he couldn't arrange a date with you,

184
00:11:33,573 --> 00:11:35,133
he spent time with me.

185
00:11:35,335 --> 00:11:38,994
I was naive back then, thinking he was handsome and affectionate.

186
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:40,553
I thought I could win his heart,

187
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,194
and turn our relationship into something more serious.

188
00:11:42,274 --> 00:11:43,553
What a scumbag.

189
00:11:43,633 --> 00:11:45,303
It's okay. It's all in the past.

190
00:11:48,753 --> 00:11:51,074
Situ Yi didn't say anything back then.

191
00:11:51,154 --> 00:11:52,793
And she only laid it all out on you now.

192
00:11:52,873 --> 00:11:54,784
She's so despicable.

193
00:11:55,373 --> 00:11:57,633
But the most detestable one is Yue Xing Zhou.

194
00:11:57,713 --> 00:11:59,624
Actually, Situ Yi was right.

195
00:11:59,914 --> 00:12:01,373
About what?

196
00:12:01,593 --> 00:12:03,873
My plan to upgrade the digital magazine can't be delayed any longer.

197
00:12:04,013 --> 00:12:05,693
We have to implement it as soon as possible.

198
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:07,194
I'm talking about Yue Xing Zhou,

199
00:12:07,274 --> 00:12:09,074
and you're talking about the digital magazine?

200
00:12:09,154 --> 00:12:12,984
Can't you have the love, hate and desire of a normal woman?

201
00:12:13,713 --> 00:12:16,354
How can you win over Shi Yan if you're not in touch with your feelings?

202
00:12:16,434 --> 00:12:19,553
If you can't win him over, will your digital magazine plan work out?

203
00:12:19,733 --> 00:12:23,264
So, pay more attention to Shi Yan, okay?

204
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,434
I'll work on the digital magazine,

205
00:12:25,514 --> 00:12:27,183
and I'll win over Shi Yan too.

206
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:29,423
Okay. Good luck then.

207
00:12:31,893 --> 00:12:34,564
Okay, I'll see you in half an hour.

208
00:12:36,893 --> 00:12:38,226
Fan, I'm not going back to the office.

209
00:12:38,307 --> 00:12:39,607
Take me to Jingxiao Tower.

210
00:12:39,847 --> 00:12:41,146
Got it, Mr. Shi.

211
00:12:47,155 --> 00:12:48,236
(Come pick me up.)

212
00:12:48,413 --> 00:12:49,673
(I missed you.)

213
00:13:05,074 --> 00:13:07,314
Oh my, are you crazy?

214
00:13:07,493 --> 00:13:09,293
You're still flirting so boldly.

215
00:13:09,353 --> 00:13:11,839
It's no big deal. He won't read it anyway.

216
00:13:51,128 --> 00:13:52,637
How did you...

217
00:13:53,106 --> 00:13:54,366
I just happened to pass by.

218
00:13:55,753 --> 00:13:56,934
What are the odds.

219
00:13:57,274 --> 00:13:58,534
What'd you expect?

220
00:14:00,274 --> 00:14:01,694
Well, that made sense.

221
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:09,133
Where is Mr. Chen?

222
00:14:09,219 --> 00:14:10,890
How come he isn't around?

223
00:14:11,173 --> 00:14:12,804
Has he been busy?

224
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:20,434
With the year-end press conference

225
00:14:20,514 --> 00:14:21,954
and the collaboration with Guan Capital,

226
00:14:22,093 --> 00:14:23,452
you guys must be busy.

227
00:14:23,539 --> 00:14:25,129
Do you need something from him?

228
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,068
No, I was just wondering how he was doing.

229
00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:30,900
I can just text him.

230
00:14:44,773 --> 00:14:46,954
Please drop me off up ahead, thank you.

231
00:14:47,034 --> 00:14:48,213
Okay.

232
00:14:58,954 --> 00:15:00,629
Why did you get off the car?

233
00:15:02,055 --> 00:15:04,326
I saw you get off, so I got off too.

234
00:15:05,832 --> 00:15:08,552
I got off to give you two some space.

235
00:15:08,633 --> 00:15:12,282
Him taking you home was a great opportunity for you to bond.

236
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,874
You saw his sour face.

237
00:15:16,506 --> 00:15:18,186
I don't even know what I said wrong.

238
00:15:18,313 --> 00:15:20,023
He just turned sulky all of a sudden.

239
00:15:20,567 --> 00:15:23,411
You called Shi Yan over, but you kept asking about another man.

240
00:15:23,492 --> 00:15:25,172
Anyone would be upset in his place.

241
00:15:25,253 --> 00:15:27,083
He must be jealous.

242
00:15:27,444 --> 00:15:31,463
Your moves are like a textbook example of awkward flirting.

243
00:15:31,554 --> 00:15:33,753
Zheng Shu Yi, you're a journalist after all.

244
00:15:33,893 --> 00:15:37,133
You must know the art of language.

245
00:15:37,233 --> 00:15:39,295
If you can win Shi Yan's heart like this,

246
00:15:39,409 --> 00:15:41,792
I'll retire from the dating game.

247
00:15:43,194 --> 00:15:44,426
Jealous?

248
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,285
Shi Yan is jealous of Chen Sheng?

249
00:15:48,473 --> 00:15:50,063
That's impossible.

250
00:15:50,744 --> 00:15:51,844
(Mr. Shi.)

251
00:15:52,449 --> 00:15:53,589
What?

252
00:15:54,434 --> 00:15:57,664
(I was wondering if you'd like to have dinner arranged for you.)

253
00:15:58,093 --> 00:16:00,644
No need. Aren't you supposed to be busy?

254
00:16:07,394 --> 00:16:10,537
I'm supposed to be busy?

255
00:16:11,674 --> 00:16:13,303
What does that mean?

256
00:16:15,873 --> 00:16:18,722
(Thanks for giving us a ride today, Mr. Shi.)

257
00:16:19,407 --> 00:16:22,357
(I'll treat you to a meal some day as a thank you.)

258
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:33,083
(Mr. Shi, what kind of fate do you think)

259
00:16:33,164 --> 00:16:35,754
(brought us together there today?)

260
00:16:41,955 --> 00:16:44,522
(He must have some bizarre sense of humor.)

261
00:16:44,674 --> 00:16:47,002
(He never replies to serious messages.)

262
00:16:52,665 --> 00:16:53,793
(Mr. Shi, )

263
00:16:53,873 --> 00:16:56,082
(were you jealous just now?)

264
00:17:07,281 --> 00:17:08,782
(You have a lot of free time.)

265
00:17:09,657 --> 00:17:10,898
(I have a lot of free time.)

266
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:12,410
What does this mean?

267
00:17:14,393 --> 00:17:17,024
Since you don't understand what he means, don't reply to him.

268
00:17:17,314 --> 00:17:19,082
Leave him hanging for a few days.

269
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:25,109
(Let's meet at our usual spot tonight.)

270
00:17:27,633 --> 00:17:30,122
I've got some things to do. I have to go.

271
00:17:31,172 --> 00:17:33,162
Didn't I tell you not to reply to him?

272
00:17:33,243 --> 00:17:35,922
Just leave him hanging for a few days.

273
00:17:36,474 --> 00:17:37,653
What's wrong?

274
00:17:47,951 --> 00:17:49,113
This is good.

275
00:17:49,256 --> 00:17:51,602
This jumble of codes is absolutely brilliant.

276
00:17:51,717 --> 00:17:54,753
Don't explain it to him. Let him guess what it means.

277
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:58,638
I guarantee that tonight he'll be tossing and turning,

278
00:17:58,789 --> 00:18:00,940
trying to figure out if it's some kind of secret love code.

279
00:18:01,034 --> 00:18:02,080
Really?

280
00:18:02,161 --> 00:18:04,772
Absolutely. Just don't reply to him.

281
00:18:05,966 --> 00:18:08,178
The first step in keeping a man interested

282
00:18:08,274 --> 00:18:09,954
is to make him wonder about you,

283
00:18:10,087 --> 00:18:11,566
keep him guessing,

284
00:18:11,647 --> 00:18:13,437
and pique his interest.

285
00:18:15,025 --> 00:18:16,575
So, don't reply to him.

286
00:19:11,593 --> 00:19:13,399
If Shi Yan finds out I brought you here,

287
00:19:13,493 --> 00:19:14,813
he'll strangle me.

288
00:19:14,917 --> 00:19:16,802
Why are you so nagging?

289
00:19:17,152 --> 00:19:18,671
I'm twenty two.

290
00:19:18,793 --> 00:19:20,914
I'm way past the legal age for clubbing.

291
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:23,682
Besides, I've been to places like this abroad.

292
00:19:25,391 --> 00:19:27,651
Hurry up and drink. Once you're done, I'll take you home.

293
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,054
(What does this mean?)

294
00:19:39,881 --> 00:19:42,031
Speak of the devil.

295
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:57,360
What does Uncle mean by this?

296
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:00,814
I don't know.

297
00:20:00,988 --> 00:20:02,448
Maybe he sent it by mistake.

298
00:20:06,554 --> 00:20:09,504
Uncle has been acting really weird lately.

299
00:20:10,867 --> 00:20:12,417
He was never normal to begin with.

300
00:20:14,468 --> 00:20:18,187
Well, well, you dare say that about Uncle.

301
00:20:18,353 --> 00:20:19,922
I'm going to tell him what you said.

302
00:20:20,536 --> 00:20:21,796
Hang on...

303
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,740
Just kidding.

304
00:20:31,373 --> 00:20:33,882
So you're afraid of him too?

305
00:20:47,994 --> 00:20:49,162
Cheers.

306
00:21:43,293 --> 00:21:44,473
Hey there,

307
00:21:44,741 --> 00:21:45,960
alone tonight?

308
00:21:48,664 --> 00:21:50,440
It's no fun drinking alone.

309
00:21:50,546 --> 00:21:52,695
How about I drink with you?

310
00:21:53,973 --> 00:21:55,274
No, thanks.

311
00:21:56,487 --> 00:21:59,313
If not today, maybe some other time.

312
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:02,690
Let's exchange numbers for another day.

313
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:04,212
I don't think so.

314
00:22:05,353 --> 00:22:06,674
Don't be shy.

315
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:08,923
What's wrong with leaving your number?

316
00:22:10,893 --> 00:22:11,953
Come on.

317
00:22:12,466 --> 00:22:13,647
I'll scan your code.

318
00:22:14,213 --> 00:22:16,883
No, thanks. My boyfriend will be here soon.

319
00:22:18,956 --> 00:22:21,898
Saying something like that just ruins the fun, doesn't it?

320
00:22:24,748 --> 00:22:26,049
Where are you going?

321
00:22:26,733 --> 00:22:27,993
What's going on?

322
00:22:31,633 --> 00:22:33,895
13318900476.

323
00:22:35,013 --> 00:22:37,232
You wanted a number, right? Well, jot it down.

324
00:22:38,952 --> 00:22:41,978
My little sister is young and a bit shy.

325
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:44,090
I'll give you my number.

326
00:22:44,253 --> 00:22:45,853
You can text me later.

327
00:22:46,006 --> 00:22:47,187
Sure.

328
00:22:54,061 --> 00:22:56,362
Miss, thanks for helping me out.

329
00:22:56,493 --> 00:22:57,994
But you gave him your number.

330
00:22:58,074 --> 00:22:59,606
What if he harasses you?

331
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:04,766
(Police Contact Card)

332
00:23:06,663 --> 00:23:08,122
You're so smart.

333
00:23:08,561 --> 00:23:10,591
It's good for girls to go out and have fun,

334
00:23:10,818 --> 00:23:13,537
but you have to learn how to read people

335
00:23:13,661 --> 00:23:15,001
and protect yourself.

336
00:23:16,034 --> 00:23:17,494
I've learned that trick.

337
00:23:20,593 --> 00:23:22,593
(I think you're being really weird right now.)

338
00:23:22,682 --> 00:23:24,713
(Is there something going on with you?)

339
00:23:24,825 --> 00:23:26,975
(I could do with another drink today.)

340
00:23:28,234 --> 00:23:29,373
Where are you?

341
00:23:30,808 --> 00:23:32,753
- Let's go and drink more.   - I'm kind of in the middle of something.

342
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:35,202
- I have to go.   - Let's drink!

343
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:55,072
In that case,

344
00:23:55,153 --> 00:23:57,294
you should really thank her and have a drink with her.

345
00:23:58,384 --> 00:24:02,455
She looks like the full package, both inside and out.

346
00:24:03,274 --> 00:24:04,454
Where is she sitting?

347
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:09,247
Looks like she's leaving.

348
00:24:09,328 --> 00:24:10,607
I guess it will have to be next time.

349
00:24:10,688 --> 00:24:12,438
It's a good thing that I added her on WeChat.

350
00:24:15,727 --> 00:24:17,242
I'll be right back.

351
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,640
But you just got back.

352
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:23,719
What's wrong with him?

353
00:24:29,133 --> 00:24:30,992
Why didn't you tell me you came?

354
00:24:33,193 --> 00:24:34,653
I saw you had a friend with you.

355
00:24:35,526 --> 00:24:36,786
How about having a drink together?

356
00:24:36,873 --> 00:24:38,133
Yue really likes you.

357
00:24:38,754 --> 00:24:41,054
I didn't expect you to be so attractive to girls.

358
00:24:42,777 --> 00:24:45,807
Well, I'm certainly not as attractive as you to them.

359
00:24:47,906 --> 00:24:49,456
She's pretty cute.

360
00:24:50,274 --> 00:24:51,823
I like her too.

361
00:24:52,693 --> 00:24:55,019
Yue is young. She doesn't know how to deal with situations like that.

362
00:24:55,448 --> 00:24:56,869
Thanks for your help.

363
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,100
I'm a little tired.

364
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:04,768
I'll drink with you another time.

365
00:25:05,373 --> 00:25:06,633
Let me take you home then.

366
00:25:08,353 --> 00:25:09,534
Ruo Shan.

367
00:25:11,714 --> 00:25:13,663
My friend's here. Bye.

368
00:25:28,803 --> 00:25:30,023
Where do you want to go?

369
00:25:31,013 --> 00:25:33,162
Just drop me off in front.

370
00:25:35,593 --> 00:25:36,793
I know a nice place.

371
00:25:36,873 --> 00:25:39,333
- We can go have a drink, or...   - I'm a little tired today.

372
00:26:25,373 --> 00:26:28,173
Shi Yan, we read your interview.

373
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,554
Well done.

374
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,313
Some of our old friends read it too.

375
00:26:31,453 --> 00:26:33,443
They all say you're young and talented.

376
00:26:33,662 --> 00:26:35,172
Thank you, Uncle Tian.

377
00:26:36,018 --> 00:26:38,442
We also read Chen Kang's interview.

378
00:26:38,728 --> 00:26:41,362
- That young man is pretty good too.   - Agree.

379
00:26:41,613 --> 00:26:43,353
When we had dinner with your father yesterday,

380
00:26:43,433 --> 00:26:45,394
we talked about Le'an's development.

381
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:47,474
They were all praising your discerning eye,

382
00:26:47,554 --> 00:26:49,162
saying you've made great progress.

383
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:52,383
So, this time, we will support you too.

384
00:26:52,533 --> 00:26:56,784
We believe Le'an has the potential to become the next unicorn.

385
00:26:57,113 --> 00:26:58,593
After acquiring Le'an,

386
00:26:58,751 --> 00:27:00,973
we'll do our best to help them monetize.

387
00:27:01,542 --> 00:27:03,092
With Guan Capital joining us,

388
00:27:03,173 --> 00:27:05,874
Yunchuang's funds will be more than sufficient,

389
00:27:06,714 --> 00:27:09,432
and we can consider collaborating with Lieying.

390
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,550
We can balance both profits

391
00:27:12,809 --> 00:27:15,122
- and personal relationships.   - That's right.

392
00:27:19,153 --> 00:27:21,479
Thank you for your support, Uncle Tian and Uncle Zhang.

393
00:27:21,604 --> 00:27:24,794
I've worked out a long-term plan for Le'an.

394
00:27:25,106 --> 00:27:26,590
Le'an's future involves paving the way

395
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,252
for the Chinese semiconductor industry.

396
00:27:28,333 --> 00:27:29,933
Once we have a technological edge,

397
00:27:30,014 --> 00:27:32,153
I'm not worried about its monetization.

398
00:27:32,574 --> 00:27:36,516
As for Lieying, I've never doubted its profitability.

399
00:27:36,794 --> 00:27:38,863
It's just that Yunchuang would rather focus on

400
00:27:39,373 --> 00:27:41,466
helping young people with entrepreneurial ideas

401
00:27:41,653 --> 00:27:43,242
who are eager to make a difference.

402
00:27:43,394 --> 00:27:45,042
I hope to support and accompany them

403
00:27:45,123 --> 00:27:47,153
in their entrepreneurial journey with funding and time.

404
00:27:47,296 --> 00:27:50,086
For well-established companies like Lieying,

405
00:27:51,514 --> 00:27:52,974
Yunchuang will not be involved.

406
00:27:58,337 --> 00:27:59,436
All right.

407
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:03,903
Since you're the CEO of Yunchuang,

408
00:28:04,136 --> 00:28:05,475
you make the call

409
00:28:06,554 --> 00:28:07,693
in such matters.

410
00:28:08,274 --> 00:28:09,734
Goodbye, gentlemen.

411
00:28:21,193 --> 00:28:24,214
It feels great to be back on the university campus.

412
00:28:24,733 --> 00:28:26,482
You should come back often when you have time.

413
00:28:26,639 --> 00:28:28,468
And attend your lectures too, Professor Yu?

414
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,133
Just call me Yu You.

415
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:33,487
When I was in college,

416
00:28:33,568 --> 00:28:36,157
we didn't have young and handsome professors like you.

417
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:39,294
Calling you "professor" makes you sound old.

418
00:28:39,832 --> 00:28:41,154
If I hadn't met you in person,

419
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:43,213
I would've thought that the journalist who wrote about Zhu Xing Guo

420
00:28:43,293 --> 00:28:44,994
and interviewed Shi Yan

421
00:28:45,074 --> 00:28:47,103
is an experienced senior journalist.

422
00:28:51,152 --> 00:28:53,262
I'm curious.

423
00:28:53,714 --> 00:28:54,994
While China is great,

424
00:28:55,074 --> 00:28:56,642
there's a lot of freedom abroad too.

425
00:28:56,733 --> 00:28:58,443
Why did you choose to come back to China?

426
00:28:58,913 --> 00:29:00,413
Because China needs me.

427
00:29:00,554 --> 00:29:02,893
Plus, I have many like-minded friends here.

428
00:29:03,943 --> 00:29:06,464
Are you talking about Mr. Guan from Guan Capital?

429
00:29:06,567 --> 00:29:08,716
Not just him, there's also Shi Yan.

430
00:29:12,363 --> 00:29:14,054
Excuse me, I have to take this.

431
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:17,933
(Yi, what are you doing now?)

432
00:29:18,058 --> 00:29:19,073
Mom, I'm busy.

433
00:29:19,153 --> 00:29:21,394
(Why have you been so busy lately?)

434
00:29:21,474 --> 00:29:23,242
(You should make time to go out)

435
00:29:23,293 --> 00:29:25,613
(and address your personal matters.)

436
00:29:25,673 --> 00:29:27,474
(When it comes to love and marriage, )

437
00:29:27,554 --> 00:29:28,874
(you need to take the initiative.)

438
00:29:28,954 --> 00:29:32,033
- (You can't just keep waiting.)   - I got it.

439
00:29:32,113 --> 00:29:35,722
Don't worry. If I find the right guy, I'll definitely take the initiative.

440
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:38,846
I really have to go now, I'm working. Bye.

441
00:29:41,673 --> 00:29:43,184
Your family is pressuring you to get married?

442
00:29:45,673 --> 00:29:46,674
I can relate.

443
00:29:46,754 --> 00:29:48,242
My mom is the same way.

444
00:29:49,692 --> 00:29:53,332
Why do I suddenly feel like we should have met sooner?

445
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,722
We probably have a lot in common.

446
00:29:56,061 --> 00:29:57,281
It seems so.

447
00:29:58,067 --> 00:30:01,373
Anyway, what do you think of Shi Yan?

448
00:30:05,002 --> 00:30:06,703
I mean,

449
00:30:07,218 --> 00:30:08,577
since you are like-minded,

450
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:11,541
what are your plans for working together in the future?

451
00:30:12,439 --> 00:30:15,352
I'm afraid I can't spoil that for you in advance.

452
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:18,475
Understood.

453
00:30:18,673 --> 00:30:21,863
Actually, I'd like to invite you for an in-depth interview.

454
00:30:21,944 --> 00:30:23,402
We could talk about your reasons for returning to China

455
00:30:23,534 --> 00:30:25,097
and your plans for the future.

456
00:30:25,178 --> 00:30:27,234
It might inspire more people to come back.

457
00:30:27,315 --> 00:30:28,602
Sure, that sounds great.

458
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:30,242
It'll be my honor.

459
00:30:30,893 --> 00:30:32,973
I'd also like to extend an early invitation for you

460
00:30:33,054 --> 00:30:35,113
to attend the Guan Capital press conference next week.

461
00:30:35,193 --> 00:30:38,122
This event might help answer some of your questions

462
00:30:38,314 --> 00:30:40,513
and provide some material for the interview.

463
00:30:40,639 --> 00:30:43,073
That sounds great. Thanks, Professor Yu.

464
00:30:43,153 --> 00:30:44,333
You're very welcome.

465
00:30:46,312 --> 00:30:49,082
Great. Hope to see you soon in Le'an.

466
00:30:52,314 --> 00:30:54,573
Mr. Shi, can I proceed with signing

467
00:30:54,654 --> 00:30:56,443
the contract with Le'an now?

468
00:30:56,587 --> 00:30:57,847
It's not that simple.

469
00:30:57,954 --> 00:31:01,413
Getting Bruce to join the R&D team is a crucial step.

470
00:31:01,881 --> 00:31:03,201
We've sorted things out externally,

471
00:31:03,282 --> 00:31:05,303
but now we need to address internal matters.

472
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:07,288
Why do I feel like

473
00:31:07,369 --> 00:31:09,958
we're facing troubles both internal and external challenges?

474
00:31:10,893 --> 00:31:12,193
Good things take time.

475
00:31:12,393 --> 00:31:15,264
Can't you see the first light of dawn breaking through now?

476
00:31:22,994 --> 00:31:24,984
Isn't this never-ending?

477
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:29,035
Zheng Shu Yi is also attending the Guan Capital's press conference.

478
00:31:30,433 --> 00:31:32,553
Who knows who she's seduced this time

479
00:31:32,648 --> 00:31:34,239
and what tricks she's used?

480
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:39,464
Maybe Shi Yan pulled some strings for her.

481
00:31:40,474 --> 00:31:42,273
She's taking advantage of her beauty

482
00:31:42,402 --> 00:31:44,352
to snatch things away from others.

483
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,390
This is really unbecoming.

484
00:31:56,823 --> 00:31:59,756
Shi Yue, could you please shred these rejected drafts for me?

485
00:31:59,837 --> 00:32:01,937
- I'm going to see the editor.   - Got it.

486
00:32:12,421 --> 00:32:13,740
I'm sorry, Yu Ling.

487
00:32:13,873 --> 00:32:15,984
It's fine. Just pick them up.

488
00:32:30,693 --> 00:32:33,025
Bei Er, are you here to shred papers too?

489
00:32:33,714 --> 00:32:35,033
I have a big stack here,

490
00:32:35,113 --> 00:32:36,762
it's probably going to take a while.

491
00:32:37,033 --> 00:32:38,193
Let me know when you're done.

492
00:32:38,297 --> 00:32:39,882
I'll go and work on my articles first.

493
00:32:40,164 --> 00:32:42,692
Why don't you just leave them here? I'll shred them for you.

494
00:32:45,913 --> 00:32:47,602
Thank you, Shi Yue.

495
00:32:47,719 --> 00:32:48,979
Don't mention it.

496
00:33:11,734 --> 00:33:14,362
Nan Nan, have you seen my invitation?

497
00:33:14,514 --> 00:33:15,634
What invitation?

498
00:33:15,714 --> 00:33:17,714
The invitation for the Guan Capital's press conference.

499
00:33:17,794 --> 00:33:19,744
I had it right here on the table just a moment ago.

500
00:33:20,308 --> 00:33:22,674
I just got back from an interview. I didn't see it.

501
00:33:22,785 --> 00:33:24,085
Maybe you should check again.

502
00:33:26,333 --> 00:33:28,962
Yue, have you seen my invitation card?

503
00:33:29,044 --> 00:33:30,554
I didn't see it.

504
00:33:31,034 --> 00:33:33,464
That's odd. I'm sure I left it right here.

505
00:33:34,152 --> 00:33:36,461
I've been busy shredding papers in the storage room.

506
00:33:59,086 --> 00:34:01,586
Shu Yi, Shi Yue didn't mean to shred it.

507
00:34:01,667 --> 00:34:02,811
Don't blame her.

508
00:34:02,892 --> 00:34:04,972
After all, she's still new and doesn't know much.

509
00:34:05,053 --> 00:34:06,093
That's right.

510
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,270
You're resourceful. I'm sure you can get another one.

511
00:34:09,394 --> 00:34:10,874
It wasn't me.

512
00:34:10,954 --> 00:34:13,054
It wasn't in the papers I took.

513
00:34:13,327 --> 00:34:16,558
Did the invitation grow legs and walk into the shredding machine then?

514
00:34:16,933 --> 00:34:19,864
Come on, Shi Yue.

515
00:34:20,292 --> 00:34:22,132
Just own up to your mistake.

516
00:34:22,213 --> 00:34:24,564
It's not a big deal.

517
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:28,513
If I did something wrong, I'd admit it, but I didn't.

518
00:34:28,593 --> 00:34:30,593
It's okay, Yue.

519
00:34:30,673 --> 00:34:32,322
It's just an invitation card.

520
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:34,055
They invited me.

521
00:34:34,136 --> 00:34:35,722
Even without the piece of paper,

522
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,550
I can still find a way to get in.

523
00:34:38,693 --> 00:34:40,162
Your team's draft

524
00:34:41,386 --> 00:34:43,215
was stuck to my invitation card.

525
00:34:49,273 --> 00:34:50,954
How did that happen, Bei Er?

526
00:34:51,034 --> 00:34:52,054
I...

527
00:34:52,193 --> 00:34:53,193
I didn't do it.

528
00:34:53,274 --> 00:34:56,893
I took the rejected drafts Yu Ling gave me to the storage room.

529
00:34:57,001 --> 00:34:58,562
I ran into Shi Yue there.

530
00:34:58,686 --> 00:35:00,196
She offered to shred them for me.

531
00:35:00,825 --> 00:35:03,082
Did you give those drafts directly to Shi Yue?

532
00:35:10,053 --> 00:35:12,493
Bei Er, shred these rejected drafts for me.

533
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:14,394
- Okay.   - Thanks.

534
00:35:25,281 --> 00:35:27,521
All right now, you didn't do it on purpose.

535
00:35:27,672 --> 00:35:31,130
Shu Yi isn't an unreasonable person.

536
00:35:31,493 --> 00:35:32,593
It's okay.

537
00:35:37,793 --> 00:35:39,722
Shu Yi, I'm really sorry.

538
00:35:39,826 --> 00:35:41,286
It's all my fault.

539
00:35:45,066 --> 00:35:47,729
Bei Er, I believe it wasn't you.

540
00:35:48,066 --> 00:35:50,642
But through today's incident, I hope you learn

541
00:35:50,818 --> 00:35:53,362
that you shouldn't admit to mistake that wasn't yours.

542
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:11,961
Xu Yu Ling is getting more out of hand.

543
00:36:13,753 --> 00:36:16,583
Jealousy can drive people crazy, it seems.

544
00:36:17,893 --> 00:36:20,122
Blame it on your excellence.

545
00:36:20,452 --> 00:36:22,932
Have you seen the data for the digital magazine?

546
00:36:23,052 --> 00:36:25,201
It's at a historic high.

547
00:36:25,834 --> 00:36:28,314
I heard that many readers are leaving messages,

548
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:30,064
saying they like this format.

549
00:36:30,753 --> 00:36:33,504
Remember to send a message to thank Mr. Shi.

550
00:36:48,074 --> 00:36:49,663
Shan Shan said

551
00:36:50,173 --> 00:36:52,042
I should leave him hanging for a few days.

552
00:36:52,394 --> 00:36:53,653
Even my patience is running out,

553
00:36:53,734 --> 00:36:55,115
and he still hasn't replied.

554
00:37:03,495 --> 00:37:05,384
(We aren't friends on WeChat.)

555
00:37:05,465 --> 00:37:07,134
(Even if I post it, he can't see it.)

556
00:37:45,153 --> 00:37:47,842
(There's even an audio message. That's quite innovative.)

557
00:37:57,933 --> 00:38:00,314
(This is like a miracle, even the impossible can happen.)

558
00:38:00,394 --> 00:38:02,384
(Shi Yan is even doing promotion himself now.)

559
00:38:03,554 --> 00:38:05,193
(You can even hear Mr.Shi's voice.)

560
00:38:05,343 --> 00:38:07,894
(After staying low-key for so long, he suddenly goes big.)

561
00:38:13,264 --> 00:38:14,704
(We aren't friends on WeChat.)

562
00:38:14,808 --> 00:38:16,678
(Even if I post it, she can't see it.)

563
00:38:22,173 --> 00:38:24,442
Guan Ji, you're amazing.

564
00:38:24,531 --> 00:38:26,161
Thank you so much!

565
00:38:29,354 --> 00:38:31,304
What did you ask Guan Ji to do for you now?

566
00:38:32,474 --> 00:38:35,133
It's not for me, it's for my superior.

567
00:38:35,633 --> 00:38:37,384
Well, not exactly for my superior.

568
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:39,693
It's hard to explain.

569
00:38:44,537 --> 00:38:45,756
Did she ask you to do this?

570
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:47,494
I wanted to this for her.

571
00:38:47,673 --> 00:38:50,153
Qin Shi Yue, listen. You're an adult now.

572
00:38:50,213 --> 00:38:51,692
You need to have the ability to discern for yourself.

573
00:38:51,773 --> 00:38:54,002
Don't just do whatever someone tells you to do.

574
00:38:56,153 --> 00:38:58,304
How come I suddenly lack discernment?

575
00:38:58,944 --> 00:39:01,094
And who asked me to do anything?

576
00:39:13,933 --> 00:39:15,893
It's okay. Thank you.

577
00:39:15,985 --> 00:39:17,855
I'll figure something out.

578
00:39:33,773 --> 00:39:36,723
Shi Yue, who left this on my desk?

579
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:42,033
Don't misunderstand.

580
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:44,914
I called Guan Capital's PR department and explained the situation.

581
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:47,606
They gave me another invitation after checking the guest list.

582
00:39:48,133 --> 00:39:50,473
You don't need to thank me. It's the least I can do.

583
00:39:51,669 --> 00:39:53,567
Well, thank you.

584
00:40:05,354 --> 00:40:06,762
By the way, Shu Yi,

585
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,816
I got you a gift.

586
00:40:09,112 --> 00:40:10,912
This color is elegant and intellectual,

587
00:40:11,001 --> 00:40:12,421
which I think suits you well.

588
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:17,162
But I should be thanking you.

589
00:40:17,397 --> 00:40:19,108
No, it's a return gift.

590
00:40:20,973 --> 00:40:23,893
You gave me a lipstick last time,

591
00:40:24,234 --> 00:40:25,532
so this is just a return gift.

592
00:40:25,628 --> 00:40:27,442
(This is such an extravagant gift.)

593
00:40:27,514 --> 00:40:29,726
(Her family must be quite well-off, )

594
00:40:29,807 --> 00:40:32,442
(which is probably how she knows people at Guan Capital.)

595
00:40:36,285 --> 00:40:39,917
Shi Yue, I can't accept such a valuable gift.

596
00:40:40,034 --> 00:40:41,614
If you really want to thank me,

597
00:40:41,695 --> 00:40:44,285
just work harder and take on more tasks.

598
00:40:44,713 --> 00:40:46,054
I...

599
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:53,282
(No matter what I say, she insists on giving me more work.)

600
00:41:05,011 --> 00:41:07,291
Do you think Guan Ji can speak well on stage?

601
00:41:07,394 --> 00:41:09,183
I think he will do just fine.

602
00:41:26,994 --> 00:41:28,504
(Where are you?)

603
00:41:34,165 --> 00:41:39,185
(Guan Capital Year End Press Conference)

604
00:41:42,474 --> 00:41:44,999
Thank you to all the guests and media friends for joining us today.

605
00:41:45,092 --> 00:41:46,713
Over the past year, the industry has witnessed

606
00:41:46,793 --> 00:41:48,914
a significant transformation,

607
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,340
marking a turning point in the sector.

608
00:41:51,573 --> 00:41:53,472
Innovation in technology and business models

609
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:56,153
have become the driving forces in our current industry landscape.

610
00:41:56,291 --> 00:41:57,512
As such,

611
00:41:57,593 --> 00:41:59,553
a commitment to practicality and innovation

612
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:01,990
will remain the core focus of Guan Capital.

613
00:42:16,095 --> 00:42:18,244
How did you manage to get such a good seat?

614
00:42:18,507 --> 00:42:20,162
Someone got it for me.

615
00:42:20,656 --> 00:42:22,156
How did you even get in?

616
00:42:22,816 --> 00:42:25,166
I wanted to get in, so I did.

617
00:42:42,929 --> 00:42:46,268
(He looks even sexy when he's serious.)
