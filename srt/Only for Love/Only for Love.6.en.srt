1
00:01:30,911 --> 00:01:36,042
(Only For Love)

2
00:01:36,123 --> 00:01:39,067
(Episode 6)

3
00:01:43,667 --> 00:01:45,245
Have your meal. I'm going back.

4
00:01:45,326 --> 00:01:47,266
Are you going home to wait for Miss Zheng?

5
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,510
Did I say something wrong?

6
00:01:54,945 --> 00:01:59,162
Didn't you say you didn't want to discuss personal matters at work?

7
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,602
Will this be too abrupt?

8
00:02:11,983 --> 00:02:15,362
Will he get angry and make things even more difficult for me?

9
00:02:17,352 --> 00:02:18,631
What's the situation now?

10
00:02:18,727 --> 00:02:20,638
Zheng Shu Yi, you can't lose.

11
00:02:21,102 --> 00:02:22,722
Who cares if he will get angry or not?

12
00:02:22,854 --> 00:02:25,419
I must get specific feedback today.

13
00:03:33,982 --> 00:03:37,319
Miss Zheng, why are you coming to see me at this hour?

14
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:42,052
(I'm stuck on my draft. Don't you know what this is about?)

15
00:03:44,988 --> 00:03:49,568
I just felt that you might want to see me, so I came to you.

16
00:03:56,705 --> 00:03:57,745
Tell me.

17
00:03:57,826 --> 00:03:59,623
Why do you feel that I want to see you?

18
00:04:01,202 --> 00:04:04,528
Otherwise, why would you reject my drafts three times?

19
00:04:06,796 --> 00:04:08,296
I see.

20
00:04:08,721 --> 00:04:11,284
Not bad, you're confident and resolute.

21
00:04:11,365 --> 00:04:13,125
Your logic flows smoothly.

22
00:04:13,282 --> 00:04:14,813
I almost think so too.

23
00:04:17,268 --> 00:04:20,347
Even my editor and editor-in-chief,

24
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:23,189
the most critical duo in the financial journalism industry,

25
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,709
couldn't find any faults in my drafts.

26
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:28,282
Yet you rejected it three times without giving any specific feedback.

27
00:04:31,284 --> 00:04:34,554
Is there any other reason aside from wanting to see me?

28
00:04:43,648 --> 00:04:45,442
My reason is that

29
00:04:45,962 --> 00:04:47,322
I'm not satisfied.

30
00:04:47,825 --> 00:04:50,214
Not satisfied? What are you not satisfied with?

31
00:04:50,295 --> 00:04:53,722
Point out each issue, and I'll revise it until you're satisfied.

32
00:05:00,769 --> 00:05:03,962
If you can't point out what's wrong, that proves that you want to see me.

33
00:05:04,043 --> 00:05:06,446
You deliberately used this method to attract my attention,

34
00:05:06,527 --> 00:05:07,986
so that I would come to see you.

35
00:05:11,028 --> 00:05:13,628
In the first draft, there were too many overly flattering words.

36
00:05:13,709 --> 00:05:15,749
I believe an excellent personal interview

37
00:05:15,845 --> 00:05:17,965
should be different from ordinary corporate PR materials.

38
00:05:18,046 --> 00:05:20,717
The writing should be more rational and objective.

39
00:05:21,036 --> 00:05:22,522
Journalists can have their preferences,

40
00:05:22,662 --> 00:05:25,202
but they shouldn't affect the readers' reading and thinking.

41
00:05:27,366 --> 00:05:29,162
You should've realized this problem.

42
00:05:29,307 --> 00:05:32,547
So, in the second draft, you changed it into an objective article.

43
00:05:32,643 --> 00:05:34,433
You didn't miss out on any contents.

44
00:05:34,514 --> 00:05:37,874
However, because you cared too much about its completeness and objectivity,

45
00:05:37,955 --> 00:05:39,946
it lacked emphasis.

46
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:42,958
The focus of this interview should be the future of Yunchuang,

47
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:45,618
not Mingyu Group, and certainly not my personal development.

48
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:51,736
What about the current draft? What's the problem?

49
00:05:52,247 --> 00:05:55,717
You put a lot of effort into the draft, and many issues have been improved.

50
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,779
But I think there should be room for discussion.

51
00:05:58,898 --> 00:06:01,238
I remember I said this in the car that day.

52
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,878
I believe a company's technical capabilities and innovation

53
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:08,838
to a certain extent determine its core competitiveness and development.

54
00:06:08,937 --> 00:06:11,479
I expressed this viewpoint to facilitate discussion,

55
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:13,059
not to draw a conclusion.

56
00:06:13,297 --> 00:06:16,209
Thus, I think when you're producing the official article,

57
00:06:16,508 --> 00:06:20,757
it should more faithfully represent my expression and true attitude.

58
00:06:22,555 --> 00:06:25,586
I humbly accept your opinions.

59
00:06:25,845 --> 00:06:28,434
This statement is indeed not rigorous enough as written by me,

60
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,997
but everyone has a different interpretation.

61
00:06:31,078 --> 00:06:34,877
You can't ask me to rewrite the entire article just because of one issue.

62
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,518
The draft has been delayed for so long.

63
00:06:36,598 --> 00:06:39,802
If I don't submit it soon, we'll have a blank space in the magazine.

64
00:06:39,953 --> 00:06:42,072
I really want to write this article well.

65
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:43,626
Please help me.

66
00:06:44,023 --> 00:06:48,446
Yunchuang is a very reputable company that has always pursued rigor.

67
00:06:48,648 --> 00:06:49,767
Due to different interpretations,

68
00:06:49,838 --> 00:06:52,159
you have put my words in a more absolute manner,

69
00:06:52,262 --> 00:06:54,932
representing my personal views and judgments.

70
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:58,799
But what I really want to explore is the potential of this industry.

71
00:06:58,901 --> 00:07:00,360
The meaning is completely different,

72
00:07:00,463 --> 00:07:03,013
and the impact it generates will certainly be vastly different.

73
00:07:04,914 --> 00:07:06,673
I understand your point now.

74
00:07:07,243 --> 00:07:09,842
Then I will amend it now.

75
00:07:28,632 --> 00:07:29,891
Come here.

76
00:07:31,078 --> 00:07:32,318
Don't you need to revise the draft?

77
00:07:32,398 --> 00:07:33,579
Amend it inside.

78
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:52,046
(Wouldn't it be inconvenient to amend the draft at his house at this hour?)

79
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:54,787
What if I run into his niece again?

80
00:07:59,428 --> 00:08:04,162
Mr. Shi, is it convenient for me to go to your house this late?

81
00:08:05,594 --> 00:08:06,915
You were lying in wait for me in front of my house.

82
00:08:06,996 --> 00:08:09,217
Now you're starting to worry if it's inconvenient for me?

83
00:08:11,202 --> 00:08:12,999
I'm just eager to revise the draft.

84
00:08:14,442 --> 00:08:16,922
Don't worry, no one can disturb you.

85
00:08:17,224 --> 00:08:20,292
You can definitely revise it until I'm satisfied.

86
00:09:11,626 --> 00:09:13,417
(She's really here to revise the draft.)

87
00:09:23,692 --> 00:09:26,317
Yue, are you sure this will work?

88
00:09:26,918 --> 00:09:28,238
Why not?

89
00:09:28,607 --> 00:09:32,560
This gift is rare even for my uncle.

90
00:09:32,962 --> 00:09:34,553
It's good wine.

91
00:09:35,586 --> 00:09:38,166
But I advise you not to have high hopes.

92
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,566
If he finds out you give him this wine to ask him not to let you work,

93
00:09:41,739 --> 00:09:43,379
I don't know how he'll react.

94
00:09:44,912 --> 00:09:46,722
Why not give the wine to me instead?

95
00:09:46,804 --> 00:09:47,944
Don't waste it.

96
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:49,926
Don't even think about it.

97
00:09:50,117 --> 00:09:52,087
I'm counting on this to save me from this desperate situation.

98
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:55,773
You don't want to help me, even Grandpa won't help me.

99
00:09:55,891 --> 00:09:58,848
This bottle of wine is my only lifeline.

100
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:52,899
Do you want some water?

101
00:10:53,395 --> 00:10:55,435
Lemon water, thanks.

102
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:16,870
Thank you, Mr. Shi.

103
00:11:20,288 --> 00:11:22,037
(He has a good memory.)

104
00:13:10,934 --> 00:13:11,995
What's wrong?

105
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,131
Did you encounter any problems?

106
00:13:15,014 --> 00:13:16,235
No.

107
00:13:17,182 --> 00:13:18,562
What's the matter then?

108
00:13:21,538 --> 00:13:23,327
I want

109
00:13:24,128 --> 00:13:26,242
to drink the one you're holding.

110
00:13:54,517 --> 00:13:55,617
Thanks.

111
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:27,162
(He didn't even look at me.)

112
00:14:27,598 --> 00:14:30,442
(It seems that this lipstick color doesn't work.)

113
00:15:03,744 --> 00:15:04,884
Hello?

114
00:15:10,748 --> 00:15:12,784
I'm very busy. It's inconvenient.

115
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:15,962
(No, Uncle!)

116
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:17,323
(Mistress?)

117
00:15:27,439 --> 00:15:28,618
What's wrong?

118
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,882
Is anyone coming?

119
00:15:32,186 --> 00:15:33,365
No.

120
00:15:35,638 --> 00:15:38,565
Is your niece coming back?

121
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:42,972
You seem to be very interested in my niece.

122
00:15:44,726 --> 00:15:46,687
No, why would I?

123
00:15:46,853 --> 00:15:48,376
I don't even know her.

124
00:15:52,447 --> 00:15:55,602
He said he's very busy and it's inconvenient.

125
00:15:56,945 --> 00:15:58,939
He said the same thing the last time I called him.

126
00:16:00,198 --> 00:16:02,078
Why inconvenience a man could have?

127
00:16:02,234 --> 00:16:03,860
Unless he's with a woman.

128
00:16:04,055 --> 00:16:07,202
I think your uncle must be hiding a woman in his house.

129
00:16:08,474 --> 00:16:10,563
Hiding a woman in his house?

130
00:16:11,952 --> 00:16:13,202
It's been three years.

131
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,962
My uncle is finally seeing someone.

132
00:16:16,284 --> 00:16:17,953
Have you met that woman?

133
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,990
Shi Yan won't let me see her. How could I possibly meet her?

134
00:16:23,238 --> 00:16:25,578
Have you ever seen him bring his girlfriend home?

135
00:16:29,316 --> 00:16:31,113
It's done. Take a look.

136
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:43,640
How is it?

137
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:45,507
Too wordy.

138
00:16:48,996 --> 00:16:50,076
Fine.

139
00:16:56,298 --> 00:16:58,482
I don't believe I can't get it done.

140
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,459
I've simplified it.

141
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,962
Mr. Shi, please check if there are any problems.

142
00:17:16,923 --> 00:17:18,966
That's not what I meant when I said this.

143
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,810
What did you mean then?

144
00:17:23,024 --> 00:17:24,444
Figure it out yourself.

145
00:17:28,988 --> 00:17:30,778
How about I write it for you directly?

146
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:17,031
Okay.

147
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,020
Really?

148
00:18:21,008 --> 00:18:23,241
Is there really nothing to amend?

149
00:18:23,422 --> 00:18:24,682
It's about there.

150
00:18:28,645 --> 00:18:30,446
If you're satisfied,

151
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,722
does that mean we can take it a step further?

152
00:18:43,602 --> 00:18:45,062
Take a step further?

153
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,361
Take a step further

154
00:18:51,716 --> 00:18:53,986
to explore the possibilities of a special coverage.

155
00:18:54,598 --> 00:18:56,305
Since you're satisfied with my draft,

156
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:59,314
I'm sure you'd be satisfied with my revision service as well.

157
00:18:59,878 --> 00:19:03,960
So, can you consider the special coverage I mentioned before?

158
00:19:09,269 --> 00:19:11,402
If I take a step further with you,

159
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:13,370
what benefit does that offer?

160
00:19:21,398 --> 00:19:23,358
If you accept my proposal,

161
00:19:23,438 --> 00:19:25,948
I'll definitely complete the articles for this series well.

162
00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:27,529
I guarantee you'll be satisfied.

163
00:19:30,218 --> 00:19:31,297
But...

164
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:33,578
I have a small request.

165
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:38,472
I hope these articles can be published

166
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:40,185
in the digital magazine of Financial Introduce.

167
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:46,047
Is this how the journalists in Financial Introduce do business?

168
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,327
I haven't even agreed to your interview for special coverage,

169
00:19:48,392 --> 00:19:50,582
and you're already making additional demands.

170
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:57,798
Sorry for my lack of consideration.

171
00:19:58,086 --> 00:19:59,886
I should have taken it step by step

172
00:20:00,021 --> 00:20:02,081
and discussed this with you after completing this interview.

173
00:20:08,401 --> 00:20:11,141
(Did I say something that offended him?)

174
00:20:13,163 --> 00:20:14,282
(Mr. Shi said)

175
00:20:14,402 --> 00:20:16,363
(he doesn't like discussing personal matters during work hours)

176
00:20:16,443 --> 00:20:17,489
(and at the workplace.)

177
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:18,758
(Right.)

178
00:20:19,114 --> 00:20:20,832
(He doesn't like discussing personal matters)

179
00:20:20,913 --> 00:20:22,442
(during work hours and at the workplace.)

180
00:20:22,523 --> 00:20:24,160
(He probably wouldn't like discussing work)

181
00:20:24,241 --> 00:20:26,402
(during personal time and in a personal space either.)

182
00:20:30,452 --> 00:20:34,627
Mr. Shi, please consider my proposal.

183
00:20:36,199 --> 00:20:40,309
Also, can you send me an email confirming the draft now?

184
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:43,904
According to the procedure,

185
00:20:43,985 --> 00:20:46,145
this should be confirmed by our company's PR Department.

186
00:20:46,226 --> 00:20:48,486
I'll go through it again tomorrow.

187
00:20:48,731 --> 00:20:49,851
Sure, Mr. Shi.

188
00:20:49,932 --> 00:20:52,283
If you have any issues tomorrow, just let me know.

189
00:20:52,447 --> 00:20:54,877
I have no problem. I can cooperate and further amend it.

190
00:20:59,273 --> 00:21:00,902
Are you sure there's no problem?

191
00:21:02,406 --> 00:21:03,787
I'm sure there's no problem.

192
00:21:06,409 --> 00:21:09,690
You stayed for so long at a strange man's house at this late hour.

193
00:21:09,771 --> 00:21:11,521
Your boyfriend doesn't have a problem with it?

194
00:21:13,206 --> 00:21:14,716
I don't have a boyfriend.

195
00:21:20,686 --> 00:21:21,946
It's true.

196
00:21:22,646 --> 00:21:24,566
On the day I first met you,

197
00:21:24,702 --> 00:21:26,597
I broke up with him after I went back.

198
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:30,738
It was the day of Guan Capital's banquet, outside Warner Estate.

199
00:21:30,858 --> 00:21:32,279
You still remember, right?

200
00:21:39,206 --> 00:21:40,389
So?

201
00:21:42,226 --> 00:21:43,976
So...

202
00:21:49,846 --> 00:21:51,228
Can I pursue you?

203
00:22:11,606 --> 00:22:13,362
If I say no,

204
00:22:14,406 --> 00:22:15,706
will you stop?

205
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:17,568
No.

206
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,630
Then why are you asking me?

207
00:22:23,146 --> 00:22:25,227
I'm just following the procedure

208
00:22:25,308 --> 00:22:27,002
to show you some respect.

209
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,551
Thank you for respecting me.

210
00:22:34,126 --> 00:22:36,447
The draft is done. You can leave now.

211
00:22:55,411 --> 00:22:56,492
Mr. Shi, good night.

212
00:22:56,573 --> 00:22:58,151
I'll add you on WeChat when I get back.

213
00:23:01,736 --> 00:23:03,775
I can chat with you when you're bored.

214
00:23:03,856 --> 00:23:06,602
I'm very good at chatting. I have a lot of stickers.

215
00:23:22,872 --> 00:23:24,922
Let me remind you one last time.

216
00:23:25,244 --> 00:23:28,170
Your uncle won't be happy if you show up at this hour.

217
00:23:28,661 --> 00:23:29,662
I don't care.

218
00:23:29,751 --> 00:23:32,021
I want to see who that woman is.

219
00:23:32,102 --> 00:23:34,922
My uncle never brought his girlfriend home before.

220
00:23:35,003 --> 00:23:37,513
I want to see who the amazing woman is.

221
00:23:38,086 --> 00:23:41,839
Maybe if my uncle is in a good mood for dating, he won't let me go to work.

222
00:23:49,566 --> 00:23:50,886
That's weird.

223
00:23:51,086 --> 00:23:53,479
Shouldn't she be busy revising the draft?

224
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:55,083
What is she doing here?

225
00:23:55,171 --> 00:23:56,216
Who is it?

226
00:23:57,354 --> 00:23:58,495
What?

227
00:23:58,726 --> 00:24:00,846
My uncle won't let me reveal my identity.

228
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,839
Everyone knows that you're the young master of the Guan family.

229
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,180
I don't want to get involved with you.

230
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,522
Who is this?

231
00:24:08,603 --> 00:24:12,763
She's the senior I told you about. She's very critical of me.

232
00:24:19,206 --> 00:24:21,522
Is the threshold for journalists so high now?

233
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:24,079
I advise you not to have any evil thoughts on her.

234
00:24:24,246 --> 00:24:26,322
My uncle doesn't like her.

235
00:24:26,504 --> 00:24:28,863
He's been rejecting her drafts multiple times.

236
00:24:29,015 --> 00:24:32,011
Of course, it's mainly because Uncle loves me so much.

237
00:24:57,966 --> 00:24:59,185
Where is she?

238
00:24:59,726 --> 00:25:01,066
Where's the woman?

239
00:25:07,846 --> 00:25:09,475
Lipstick?

240
00:25:10,071 --> 00:25:11,781
There was really a woman.

241
00:25:12,032 --> 00:25:13,331
What are you doing here?

242
00:25:14,132 --> 00:25:15,802
Didn't I ask you to go back to Grandpa's house?

243
00:25:17,281 --> 00:25:19,520
I came to deliver this wine to you.

244
00:25:20,889 --> 00:25:23,482
Such a good thing should be delivered to you as soon as possible.

245
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:26,922
What if you get too busy and don't have time to have dinner at Grandpa's?

246
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,550
Leave it here and go home early to rest,

247
00:25:29,647 --> 00:25:31,442
so you don't have trouble waking up for work tomorrow.

248
00:25:31,551 --> 00:25:33,981
You should have some sense of being an employee now.

249
00:25:37,726 --> 00:25:41,036
Uncle, why don't you ask the woman to stay?

250
00:25:41,846 --> 00:25:43,402
What woman?

251
00:25:43,517 --> 00:25:46,708
The one you just had a drink with.

252
00:25:47,029 --> 00:25:49,658
It's so late, why didn't you ask her to stay?

253
00:25:50,205 --> 00:25:53,155
Is it because she's not pretty enough?

254
00:25:54,816 --> 00:25:56,957
Or did she reject you?

255
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:00,157
Or

256
00:26:00,246 --> 00:26:03,277
maybe you haven't dated for so long that you're scared now?

257
00:26:05,836 --> 00:26:08,318
What's wrong with Shi Yan?

258
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:09,660
I know, right?

259
00:26:09,975 --> 00:26:12,615
It was the first time in my life that I confessed to someone,

260
00:26:12,735 --> 00:26:14,495
and he just kicked me out after hearing it.

261
00:26:14,603 --> 00:26:16,248
Is this reasonable?

262
00:26:16,344 --> 00:26:18,175
Is Shi Yan even a man?

263
00:26:19,846 --> 00:26:22,447
Now I'm sure he's a man,

264
00:26:22,642 --> 00:26:24,671
but he's a childish one.

265
00:26:25,326 --> 00:26:26,526
Shi Yan is childish?

266
00:26:26,614 --> 00:26:27,655
Yes.

267
00:26:27,815 --> 00:26:30,225
Boys will be boys.

268
00:26:30,865 --> 00:26:34,682
When they aren't being honest with themselves, women don't stand a chance.

269
00:26:34,775 --> 00:26:36,814
Haven't you read those novels about domineering CEOs?

270
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:40,375
The more a man likes you, the less he admits it.

271
00:26:40,456 --> 00:26:43,336
 The more he likes you, the more he wants to bully you.

272
00:26:43,417 --> 00:26:45,322
Shi Yan is exactly like that.

273
00:26:49,967 --> 00:26:51,157
Qin Shi Yue.

274
00:26:51,434 --> 00:26:53,864
What nonsense is running through your mind?

275
00:26:54,249 --> 00:26:57,078
You invited her to have a drink at your house at this late hour.

276
00:26:57,159 --> 00:26:59,079
After having a drink, you immediately told her to leave,

277
00:26:59,248 --> 00:27:00,958
without spending some time together.

278
00:27:01,084 --> 00:27:02,164
Oh my God.

279
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:04,516
Uncle, are you a pervert?

280
00:27:06,846 --> 00:27:10,035
You're talking about a pervert.

281
00:27:10,578 --> 00:27:12,082
That's roughly the idea.

282
00:27:12,167 --> 00:27:13,562
Try to understand it.

283
00:27:13,643 --> 00:27:16,034
Otherwise, why would he keep rejecting your drafts?

284
00:27:16,535 --> 00:27:17,995
Because

285
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:20,865
there were some issues with my drafts.

286
00:27:21,369 --> 00:27:23,608
Of course, that's part of the reason.

287
00:27:23,689 --> 00:27:27,159
But the most important thing is he wants to attract your attention.

288
00:27:27,966 --> 00:27:29,796
He must be interested in you.

289
00:27:31,366 --> 00:27:35,002
I really admire your inexplicable confidence.

290
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:39,841
This is a conclusion I've drawn through countless practical experiences.

291
00:27:39,922 --> 00:27:42,802
As the saying goes, experience is the best teacher.

292
00:27:43,046 --> 00:27:45,316
Though the tactics are old, they work.

293
00:27:47,521 --> 00:27:51,762
But why did you suddenly confess to him today?

294
00:27:52,086 --> 00:27:54,225
Do you really have feelings for him?

295
00:27:56,286 --> 00:27:57,606
How is that possible?

296
00:27:57,687 --> 00:27:59,717
I did it for the sake of my article.

297
00:28:01,602 --> 00:28:03,129
Didn't you tell me to...

298
00:28:03,212 --> 00:28:05,932
Then why do I feel like something is off?

299
00:28:06,013 --> 00:28:09,092
You two were alone and there was a sense of attraction in the air.

300
00:28:09,241 --> 00:28:11,512
And you suddenly confessed to him.

301
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:16,941
Could it be that you've unconsciously developed feelings for him?

302
00:28:20,472 --> 00:28:22,482
Think carefully about what I said.

303
00:28:23,145 --> 00:28:24,226
I won't argue with you anymore.

304
00:28:24,307 --> 00:28:26,527
I'm heading back. I have to work tomorrow.

305
00:28:28,092 --> 00:28:31,602
Honestly, I think he's interested in you too.

306
00:28:31,689 --> 00:28:34,722
If both of you are interested, what are you waiting for?

307
00:28:34,857 --> 00:28:38,047
Strike while the iron is hot.

308
00:28:43,004 --> 00:28:44,922
- Goodbye.   - Bye.

309
00:28:45,003 --> 00:28:47,202
Finish the food, don't waste it.

310
00:28:53,489 --> 00:28:56,050
When it comes to dating, you have to learn Guan Ji.

311
00:28:56,131 --> 00:28:57,842
Don't be so insensitive.

312
00:28:58,051 --> 00:29:01,441
If you really like her, you have to take the initiative.

313
00:29:01,748 --> 00:29:05,578
If you invite her over, you should strike while the iron is hot.

314
00:29:07,783 --> 00:29:10,572
You still have time to talk nonsense here.

315
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:13,002
It seems that the job at the magazine is indeed very easy.

316
00:29:13,176 --> 00:29:14,257
How about this?

317
00:29:14,326 --> 00:29:17,476
Straight away come and work at Yunchuang. Stop dawdling.

318
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:19,847
No, thanks.

319
00:29:19,928 --> 00:29:21,922
Uncle, you should rest early.

320
00:29:22,271 --> 00:29:25,162
Working at the magazine is not easy at all.

321
00:29:25,288 --> 00:29:27,528
I didn't get off work until after eight o'clock today.

322
00:29:27,705 --> 00:29:31,266
It's been a long day. I worked hard and took it very seriously.

323
00:29:31,347 --> 00:29:33,457
I have to go back and get some rest.

324
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:34,898
Don't act pitiful in front of me.

325
00:29:35,018 --> 00:29:36,078
It won't work.

326
00:29:36,192 --> 00:29:37,253
Also...

327
00:29:41,161 --> 00:29:42,831
Save your money on wine.

328
00:30:28,642 --> 00:30:31,202
(Silence)

329
00:30:40,406 --> 00:30:42,717
Shi Yan didn't say I couldn't pursue him,

330
00:30:43,222 --> 00:30:44,892
so he implicitly agreed.

331
00:30:45,246 --> 00:30:46,666
What am I waiting for?

332
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:59,402
Mr. Shi, how afraid are you that others will find your WeChat account?

333
00:31:05,711 --> 00:31:07,012
(I'm home.)

334
00:31:08,215 --> 00:31:10,522
(Mr. Shi, are you sleeping already?)

335
00:31:11,134 --> 00:31:12,984
(I think you must be very busy.)

336
00:31:16,366 --> 00:31:19,468
(You just need to read the first three words of the previous message.)

337
00:31:24,268 --> 00:31:25,710
I saw this online.

338
00:31:25,791 --> 00:31:29,762
It can express my feelings without being too cheesy, which is just right.

339
00:31:37,967 --> 00:31:39,242
(It will be cloudy with light rain tonight, )

340
00:31:39,323 --> 00:31:40,922
(with temperatures ranging from 5 to 12°C.)

341
00:31:41,003 --> 00:31:42,452
(Tomorrow will be cloudy turning to partly cloudy, )

342
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:44,002
(with temperatures between 3 and 10°C.)

343
00:31:44,288 --> 00:31:46,082
(There will be continuous rainy weather in the coming days, )

344
00:31:46,163 --> 00:31:47,403
(coinciding with the workweek. )

345
00:31:47,496 --> 00:31:49,782
(Please remember to plan your travel accordingly.)

346
00:31:49,863 --> 00:31:51,202
(Make sure to stay warm.)

347
00:31:56,584 --> 00:31:57,784
(Uncle.)

348
00:31:57,903 --> 00:32:00,282
(When it comes to dating, you have to learn Guan Ji.)

349
00:32:00,363 --> 00:32:02,282
(Don't be so insensitive.)

350
00:32:02,495 --> 00:32:05,413
(If you really like her, you have to take the initiative.)

351
00:32:05,522 --> 00:32:09,362
(If you invite her over, you should strike while the iron is hot.)

352
00:32:23,082 --> 00:32:24,962
(Actress)

353
00:32:42,702 --> 00:32:44,362
Unsubscribe?

354
00:32:45,495 --> 00:32:47,428
Shi Yan, what is wrong with you?

355
00:33:04,097 --> 00:33:06,802
Mr. Shi, I just got a call from Le'an Technology.

356
00:33:06,931 --> 00:33:09,490
They said they have reviewed our funding pool plan.

357
00:33:09,641 --> 00:33:13,293
Mr. Chen said while the funding pool provides some assurance

358
00:33:13,374 --> 00:33:14,702
for their future research and development,

359
00:33:14,783 --> 00:33:17,061
there is still a considerable gap compared to Lieying's acquisition price

360
00:33:17,142 --> 00:33:18,762
at the current stage.

361
00:33:19,088 --> 00:33:21,044
So, they are very concerned about the solution

362
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:22,784
to the technical issues you mentioned last time.

363
00:33:24,646 --> 00:33:29,037
Mr. Shi, our last offer was already the highest price we could give.

364
00:33:30,317 --> 00:33:33,162
Although there's an increase, it cannot match the acquisition price.

365
00:33:33,312 --> 00:33:36,342
If we continue to deadlock here, will it lead to changes?

366
00:33:36,958 --> 00:33:38,988
I understand. Go get busy first.

367
00:33:50,544 --> 00:33:53,122
(Do you have time? Let's meet and talk.)

368
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,389
Shu Yi, good morning.

369
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:29,889
Morning, Shi Yue.

370
00:34:35,846 --> 00:34:37,097
What's the matter?

371
00:34:37,178 --> 00:34:38,562
No, nothing.

372
00:34:38,705 --> 00:34:41,002
Your lipstick looks really nice.

373
00:34:43,886 --> 00:34:44,946
Take it.

374
00:34:45,966 --> 00:34:47,105
I...

375
00:34:58,786 --> 00:35:00,402
It's not that.

376
00:35:01,704 --> 00:35:05,217
She seems to never use that shade normally.

377
00:35:08,951 --> 00:35:11,077
Zheng Shu Yi seems to have had her drafts

378
00:35:11,158 --> 00:35:12,651
rejected several times by Yunchuang.

379
00:35:12,852 --> 00:35:15,519
She had never been in this situation before.

380
00:35:16,188 --> 00:35:18,562
How do you know she didn't offend anyone?

381
00:35:18,858 --> 00:35:21,137
Encountering a client who rejected drafts without giving feedback

382
00:35:21,218 --> 00:35:22,559
is really tough.

383
00:35:24,513 --> 00:35:28,116
(So to say, Uncle is indeed my biological uncle.)

384
00:35:28,197 --> 00:35:31,107
(But Zheng Shu Yi is probably not the woman.)

385
00:35:31,216 --> 00:35:34,176
(Who could bear to intentionally make their crush suffer?)

386
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:35,684
(Is that even humane?)

387
00:35:36,308 --> 00:35:37,467
(But...)

388
00:35:37,617 --> 00:35:40,624
(My uncle might like this.)

389
00:35:40,966 --> 00:35:43,635
(I feel like he's capable of doing such a thing.)

390
00:35:50,778 --> 00:35:52,198
Zheng Shu Yi.

391
00:35:52,298 --> 00:35:54,442
Can you stop being so hardworking?

392
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:56,777
At least let us take a breather.

393
00:35:59,286 --> 00:36:02,636
(Securing Guan Capital is a crucial step for Mingyu Yunchuang.)

394
00:36:02,859 --> 00:36:05,728
(Guan Capital invited Yu You back to the country at this moment.)

395
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:08,393
(And Shi Yan went to his welcome dinner.)

396
00:36:09,115 --> 00:36:12,075
You're already choosing the next topic.

397
00:36:12,206 --> 00:36:13,877
You're not giving us any chance.

398
00:36:14,977 --> 00:36:17,126
Why? Have you settled Shi Yan?

399
00:36:18,972 --> 00:36:20,271
Basically.

400
00:36:23,166 --> 00:36:26,987
(Yu You's opinion should be essential to Guan Capital's decision.)

401
00:36:27,126 --> 00:36:30,702
(Talking to him will surely provide many clues.)

402
00:36:31,931 --> 00:36:34,090
(Actually, it's not hard to guess what Shi Yan wants to do.)

403
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,740
(But the key is how he will proceed with each step.)

404
00:36:36,821 --> 00:36:39,606
(Readers must be very interested in this.)

405
00:37:18,718 --> 00:37:20,744
That's good. It's all 10 rings.

406
00:37:25,857 --> 00:37:27,522
Last time it was rock climbing. This time, it's shooting.

407
00:37:27,603 --> 00:37:29,424
You really don't seem like a college professor.

408
00:37:31,362 --> 00:37:33,593
You don't look like a rich second-generation either.

409
00:37:35,217 --> 00:37:37,848
Actually, Bruce is also a bit different.

410
00:37:38,518 --> 00:37:39,657
How so?

411
00:37:40,028 --> 00:37:41,529
The domestic market is vast,

412
00:37:41,632 --> 00:37:43,951
and the conditions you offered Bruce are very attractive.

413
00:37:44,032 --> 00:37:46,458
Many people would consider this a great choice.

414
00:37:47,517 --> 00:37:48,636
But Bruce is just like me.

415
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:51,156
He likes excitement, adventure, and challenges.

416
00:37:51,378 --> 00:37:55,431
So, salary and conditions are not his primary factors for consideration.

417
00:37:55,807 --> 00:37:58,837
So, don't try to predict or judge him with fixed thinking.

418
00:37:59,566 --> 00:38:02,315
He's coming next week. Have you figured out how to convince him?

419
00:38:03,526 --> 00:38:04,946
Do you have any suggestions?

420
00:38:06,836 --> 00:38:10,816
We both enjoy doing interesting and challenging things.

421
00:38:10,966 --> 00:38:12,476
Actually, so does Bruce.

422
00:38:12,687 --> 00:38:15,637
Interesting and challenging, both are indispensable.

423
00:38:18,405 --> 00:38:20,784
Then why are you willing to return to China?

424
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,482
In fact, the academic environment is getting better here.

425
00:38:24,609 --> 00:38:27,409
And I also get to meet friends like you and Guan Ji.

426
00:38:28,201 --> 00:38:30,442
Speaking of which, you're very interesting.

427
00:38:30,523 --> 00:38:32,082
What you do is also very challenging.

428
00:38:32,163 --> 00:38:34,683
You could've accepted Mingyu Group's offer and made everyone happy,

429
00:38:34,818 --> 00:38:37,409
but you chose to start your own business and establish Yunchuang.

430
00:38:37,654 --> 00:38:40,114
Isn't it fun working together with you?

431
00:38:41,389 --> 00:38:43,218
So, I'm that annoying, huh?

432
00:38:44,326 --> 00:38:47,162
But I believe if I could attract you back to China,

433
00:38:47,345 --> 00:38:49,645
I can certainly attract Bruce too.

434
00:38:50,446 --> 00:38:54,962
And I'm confident that Bruce will be impressed by Chen Kang's spirit.

435
00:39:02,305 --> 00:39:03,805
Sorry, I have to take this call.

436
00:39:05,351 --> 00:39:06,371
Hello.

437
00:39:06,545 --> 00:39:08,385
(Professor Yu, I'm Zheng Shu Yi.)

438
00:39:08,466 --> 00:39:10,625
(I don't know if you still remember me.)

439
00:39:10,706 --> 00:39:12,260
Miss Zheng, of course I remember you.

440
00:39:12,341 --> 00:39:13,362
(Here's the thing, )

441
00:39:13,443 --> 00:39:16,162
(it was too rushed last time, and I didn't get to talk to you.)

442
00:39:16,246 --> 00:39:17,896
(I would like to schedule a time with you next week)

443
00:39:17,977 --> 00:39:20,457
(to ask you some questions about the industry.)

444
00:39:20,554 --> 00:39:22,054
Okay, sure.

445
00:39:22,153 --> 00:39:24,374
Let me check my schedule, I'll get back to you later.

446
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,402
(Okay, thank you very much.)

447
00:39:26,483 --> 00:39:27,503
Okay.

448
00:39:34,806 --> 00:39:36,436
Can I pursue you?

449
00:39:45,278 --> 00:39:46,909
Come on, one more round.

450
00:39:48,176 --> 00:39:51,602
Ms. Yi, I've proofread the article of my interview with Guan Ji.

451
00:39:51,699 --> 00:39:53,450
It's ready for layout and printing.

452
00:39:58,568 --> 00:39:59,627
Ms. Yi?

453
00:40:02,889 --> 00:40:05,049
Ms. Yi, Mr. Shi has already verbally confirmed.

454
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:06,729
Yunchuang will respond officially soon.

455
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:08,521
This version of the article should be fine.

456
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,962
Shu Yi, we understand you've worked hard this time,

457
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:14,162
but we have to consider the overall situation.

458
00:40:14,273 --> 00:40:16,394
Can we rely on verbal confirmation?

459
00:40:16,474 --> 00:40:17,994
The front-page content is not child's play.

460
00:40:18,075 --> 00:40:20,734
If something goes wrong, the responsibility will be significant.

461
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,120
I have confidence in my article.

462
00:40:23,256 --> 00:40:26,122
And Mr. Shi also promised me he would give me email confirmation today.

463
00:40:26,217 --> 00:40:28,858
What's the use of your confidence at this moment?

464
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:31,099
If something goes wrong, how will you take responsibility?

465
00:40:31,219 --> 00:40:32,599
Will you resign?

466
00:40:33,926 --> 00:40:38,162
Since he agreed to reply by today, let's wait until midnight.

467
00:40:38,305 --> 00:40:41,705
If there's no response or it's not approved by Yunchuang,

468
00:40:41,863 --> 00:40:45,444
then Yu Ling's article will be on the front page.

469
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,242
I'm fine with that.

470
00:40:47,643 --> 00:40:48,743
What about you?

471
00:40:49,166 --> 00:40:50,507
That's fine with me.

472
00:41:11,486 --> 00:41:12,926
You seemed out of sorts just now.

473
00:41:13,031 --> 00:41:14,446
It's not like your usual standard.

474
00:41:20,926 --> 00:41:22,765
(Mr. Shi, it's urgent.)

475
00:41:22,886 --> 00:41:24,802
(You confirmed my draft yesterday.)

476
00:41:24,883 --> 00:41:26,914
(Please send me a confirmation as soon as possible.)

477
00:41:31,449 --> 00:41:33,999
Is that so? Let's have another round.

478
00:41:38,087 --> 00:41:41,047
(Miss Zheng, Mr. Shi isn't with me today.)

479
00:41:41,128 --> 00:41:45,038
(He must be busy. I can't reach him either. I can't help you.)

480
00:42:00,167 --> 00:42:01,848
It's so late now.

481
00:42:01,966 --> 00:42:03,926
So what if it doesn't get approved?

482
00:42:04,006 --> 00:42:05,765
What are we waiting for here?

483
00:42:05,846 --> 00:42:09,406
What can we do? We work in the news business. We have to be rigorous.

484
00:42:09,486 --> 00:42:12,752
We agreed to wait until 12 am, it has to be 12 am sharp, not a minute less.
