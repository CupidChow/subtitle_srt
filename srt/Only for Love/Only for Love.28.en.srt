00:01:30,803 --> 00:01:36,035
(Only For Love)

2
00:01:36,116 --> 00:01:39,002
(Episode 28)

3
00:02:09,237 --> 00:02:10,958
It turns out that

4
00:02:12,117 --> 00:02:13,638
I'm not that special to you.

5
00:02:58,235 --> 00:03:00,074
For now, let's not drive this car.

6
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,402
Shi Yue.

7
00:03:17,895 --> 00:03:19,920
Here are my notes from class recently.

8
00:03:20,032 --> 00:03:22,423
Thank you, Yu Cheng. I'll return them to you soon.

9
00:03:28,813 --> 00:03:30,482
When will you be back for class?

10
00:03:32,688 --> 00:03:34,522
Will you still come back for class?

11
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,518
Of course. I have something on recently.

12
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:39,518
Once I'm done, I'll be back for class.

13
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,202
So, I'll still have to trouble you to lend me your notebook.

14
00:03:42,682 --> 00:03:44,139
I'll treat you to dinner when I come back.

15
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,570
You're treating me to dinner?

16
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,350
Qin Shi Yue.

17
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,350
Professor Yu.

18
00:03:56,117 --> 00:03:57,467
Professor Yu.

19
00:04:02,038 --> 00:04:03,374
Professor Yu is really nice.

20
00:04:03,455 --> 00:04:06,478
Explain to him properly why you haven't been coming to class lately.

21
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,389
I still have classes. I'm leaving first. Goodbye, Professor Yu.

22
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,839
Shi Yue, bye-bye.

23
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,273
Bye-bye.

24
00:04:30,774 --> 00:04:32,094
Do you have time?

25
00:04:32,198 --> 00:04:33,548
Let's have a meal together.

26
00:04:36,755 --> 00:04:37,922
Sure.

27
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,922
About Le'an, how is it going?

28
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,680
We have contacted an expert.

29
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,920
Let's see if he can help Le'an.

30
00:05:07,431 --> 00:05:08,686
Work is important.

31
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:11,402
But don't ignore your personal matters.

32
00:05:13,351 --> 00:05:15,922
It's been a while since I saw Miss Zheng.

33
00:05:16,147 --> 00:05:17,546
How have you two been lately?

34
00:05:18,037 --> 00:05:20,237
When you have time, take her to the horse ranch to play.

35
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,180
She probably won't go there again.

36
00:05:33,258 --> 00:05:36,468
It's normal for young people to act up.

37
00:05:36,597 --> 00:05:38,037
Be more understanding.

38
00:05:38,157 --> 00:05:40,078
Communicate and comprehend more.

39
00:05:40,477 --> 00:05:42,627
I can see that she is really devoted to you.

40
00:05:48,308 --> 00:05:50,787
She has a lot of people and things to devote to now.

41
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,439
And, she also has many other choices.

42
00:05:55,118 --> 00:05:56,468
Is that so?

43
00:06:34,717 --> 00:06:36,067
Shi...

44
00:06:38,306 --> 00:06:39,327
Shi Yue.

45
00:06:39,408 --> 00:06:40,998
The fish here is cooked really well.

46
00:06:41,078 --> 00:06:42,837
And, eating fish is good for the body.

47
00:06:42,917 --> 00:06:44,267
Why don't you give it a try?

48
00:06:51,717 --> 00:06:52,802
How is it?

49
00:06:53,198 --> 00:06:54,238
It's tasty.

50
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,402
Thanks.

51
00:07:04,238 --> 00:07:06,398
Is there a reason

52
00:07:06,764 --> 00:07:08,082
why you came here suddenly today?

53
00:07:08,236 --> 00:07:10,998
Nothing. Just looking for Yu Cheng to borrow his notes.

54
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,629
I can give you the course materials.

55
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,040
But I'm not sure if I can understand the course materials.

56
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:20,651
Then, you should continue to attend the class.

57
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,517
I mean, we are currently talking about primary and secondary markets.

58
00:07:30,628 --> 00:07:32,868
Understanding these can help with your work.

59
00:07:37,238 --> 00:07:40,627
So, if there's anything you don't understand, you can come and ask me.

60
00:07:41,697 --> 00:07:44,279
(Why is Yu You suddenly so concerned about me?)

61
00:07:44,357 --> 00:07:46,998
(Could it be because I haven't been around lately)

62
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,899
(and he realized my importance?)

63
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,882
(Looks like I can't get too close to him in the future.)

64
00:07:51,987 --> 00:07:53,548
(I have to keep my distance sometimes.)

65
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:56,989
I got sick recently.

66
00:07:57,238 --> 00:07:59,720
My family was really strict with me

67
00:07:59,806 --> 00:08:01,480
and didn't even let me go to work.

68
00:08:01,712 --> 00:08:04,832
That's why I probably can't come to your class in the future.

69
00:08:34,837 --> 00:08:36,358
Why did you come back so late?

70
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,720
I went out to dinner with my friends.

71
00:08:46,477 --> 00:08:47,827
Uncle.

72
00:08:49,078 --> 00:08:52,118
Are you unhappy?

73
00:08:56,398 --> 00:08:58,118
It's okay, Uncle.

74
00:08:58,217 --> 00:09:00,475
"Victory and defeat are common in war."

75
00:09:00,556 --> 00:09:02,436
You just showed up too late.

76
00:09:04,354 --> 00:09:05,482
Defeat?

77
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,720
It's all fate.

78
00:09:10,957 --> 00:09:12,261
You should quit your job tomorrow.

79
00:09:12,342 --> 00:09:13,741
Don't go to work anymore.

80
00:09:25,694 --> 00:09:27,800
(I just made some progress with Yu You today.)

81
00:09:27,877 --> 00:09:29,397
(If I quit my job tomorrow, )

82
00:09:29,493 --> 00:09:31,453
(how will Yu You think of me?)

83
00:09:31,813 --> 00:09:33,694
(Well, I'll take a long leave first.)

84
00:10:05,918 --> 00:10:07,268
Shu Yi.

85
00:10:09,027 --> 00:10:10,377
You're back?

86
00:10:13,717 --> 00:10:15,157
I want to

87
00:10:15,997 --> 00:10:17,347
take a leave.

88
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,467
What?

89
00:10:20,597 --> 00:10:21,958
My family worries about my health

90
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,437
and they want me to rest at home.

91
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,510
Then, you should rest well.

92
00:10:29,678 --> 00:10:31,028
Thank you, Shu Yi.

93
00:10:31,508 --> 00:10:33,629
Then, I'll go tell the editor.

94
00:10:36,224 --> 00:10:37,509
Yue.

95
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,987
What's wrong?

96
00:10:40,837 --> 00:10:42,358
Does your uncle

97
00:10:42,957 --> 00:10:44,758
know you're taking a long leave?

98
00:10:49,978 --> 00:10:53,522
It's him who asked me to take a break and rest at home.

99
00:10:59,477 --> 00:11:00,757
Take good care of yourself then.

100
00:11:00,837 --> 00:11:01,998
Come back earlier.

101
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,637
I'm fine. I'll recover soon.

102
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,762
Shu Yi. Wait for me to come back.

103
00:11:07,179 --> 00:11:09,442
I still need to learn a lot from you.

104
00:11:16,767 --> 00:11:17,807
(So, )

105
00:11:17,997 --> 00:11:20,037
(it's all your arrangement)

106
00:11:21,205 --> 00:11:24,045
(to keep people around you away from me.)

107
00:12:07,647 --> 00:12:09,438
Mr. Shi has been in a bad mood recently.

108
00:12:09,518 --> 00:12:10,637
It must be because of her, right?

109
00:12:10,717 --> 00:12:12,002
I guess so.

110
00:12:12,171 --> 00:12:15,438
At Yunchuang, I've never seen any other woman sleeping and eating

111
00:12:15,518 --> 00:12:16,878
in Mr. Shi's office.

112
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:21,031
So, what do you think happened between them?

113
00:12:21,492 --> 00:12:22,842
How would I know?

114
00:12:23,038 --> 00:12:26,307
Looks like she did something wrong.

115
00:12:33,798 --> 00:12:35,002
Miss Zheng.

116
00:12:36,868 --> 00:12:38,218
Mr. Chen.

117
00:12:39,837 --> 00:12:41,187
Sorry, Miss Zheng.

118
00:12:41,837 --> 00:12:44,317
Today, Mr. Shi doesn't have time to see you.

119
00:12:49,117 --> 00:12:51,162
It's okay. I'll come tomorrow.

120
00:12:51,717 --> 00:12:53,186
Mr. Shi also said

121
00:12:53,877 --> 00:12:56,548
to stop the cooperation between Yunchuang and Financial Introduce.

122
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:08,388
Mr. Chen, can you arrange for me to meet with Mr. Shi?

123
00:13:08,477 --> 00:13:10,077
I want to talk to him in person.

124
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:12,922
Sorry.

125
00:13:13,628 --> 00:13:14,978
Mr. Shi said

126
00:13:15,225 --> 00:13:16,586
he won't meet you.

127
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:25,359
Okay. Thank you for your help.

128
00:13:42,003 --> 00:13:44,393
(Mr. Shi. I'm really sorry.)

129
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,642
(About Yunchuang's special report...)

130
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,700
(I'm sorry.)

131
00:13:54,877 --> 00:13:56,482
(I shouldn't have lied to you.)

132
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,322
(Actually, I wanted to tell you everything a long time ago.)

133
00:14:00,837 --> 00:14:02,878
(I just didn't know how to start.)

134
00:14:03,877 --> 00:14:06,478
(And, I was also scared that after telling you, )

135
00:14:06,558 --> 00:14:08,118
(it would become like this.)

136
00:14:09,837 --> 00:14:11,198
(About all of this, )

137
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:13,638
(I'm really, really sorry.)

138
00:14:29,442 --> 00:14:30,863
(It's my fault.)

139
00:14:30,944 --> 00:14:32,265
(If possible, )

140
00:14:32,354 --> 00:14:34,474
(I wish I could apologize to you in person.)

141
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,449
(But I hope my mistake won't affect)

142
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,522
(the cooperation between Yunchuang and Financial Introduce.)

143
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,030
(Is that okay?)

144
00:14:49,558 --> 00:14:50,908
(I'm sorry.)

145
00:14:51,549 --> 00:14:53,389
(But I'm sincere to you.)

146
00:16:08,894 --> 00:16:12,082
The special report on Yunchuang has had a great response.

147
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,320
The editor-in-chief wants to strike while the iron is hot.

148
00:16:14,403 --> 00:16:15,442
Shu Yi,

149
00:16:16,272 --> 00:16:18,962
you can put more effort into this from now on.

150
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,522
Okay.

151
00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:26,238
What about the next issue? Do you have any ideas or directions?

152
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:28,677
Not yet.

153
00:16:33,206 --> 00:16:35,406
If you don't have any ideas for now,

154
00:16:35,757 --> 00:16:37,802
there have been a few industry forums recently.

155
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:39,598
You can go and look for some inspiration.

156
00:16:41,558 --> 00:16:42,908
Okay.

157
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,990
Mr. Shi, the related materials from Professor Li's lab

158
00:17:38,071 --> 00:17:40,101
have been organized and sent to your email.

159
00:17:48,577 --> 00:17:50,402
(Hello, Mr. Shi.)

160
00:17:50,518 --> 00:17:54,507
(I'm sorry for my improper handling which caused your unhappiness.)

161
00:17:54,637 --> 00:17:56,638
(With your help and support, )

162
00:17:56,718 --> 00:17:59,317
(the first special report on Yunchuang was a great success.)

163
00:17:59,428 --> 00:18:01,749
(This series of special reports is very valuable for)

164
00:18:01,893 --> 00:18:03,612
(Financial Introduce and Yunchuang.)

165
00:18:03,859 --> 00:18:05,842
(I hope we can put the past aside)

166
00:18:05,979 --> 00:18:08,059
(and continue to work with Financial Introduce.)

167
00:18:08,478 --> 00:18:11,558
(I will also withdraw from this special report)

168
00:18:11,639 --> 00:18:14,560
(and let other colleagues from Financial Introduce take over.)

169
00:18:15,007 --> 00:18:16,722
(To ensure a smooth transition, )

170
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:19,014
(the subsequent planned topics are attached here.)

171
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,642
(Please take a look.)

172
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,430
Mr. Shi.

173
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,798
What's wrong with this material?

174
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,109
If the person you like gets angry,

175
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:32,629
what would you do?

176
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,162
Try to cheer her up.

177
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,680
Apologize to her so that she won't be mad.

178
00:18:39,117 --> 00:18:41,838
But, if she's still angry

179
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,388
and blocks you?

180
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,069
This mad?

181
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:46,478
Then, I need to explain it clearly.

182
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:47,757
Find a way to apologize in person.

183
00:18:47,837 --> 00:18:49,677
If one time doesn't work, try twice.

184
00:18:53,419 --> 00:18:54,769
What if she sends you an email?

185
00:18:54,998 --> 00:18:56,117
That definitely won't work.

186
00:18:56,197 --> 00:18:57,802
Nowadays, who sends emails to

187
00:18:58,261 --> 00:18:59,611
apologize?

188
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,282
Mr. Shi.

189
00:19:33,998 --> 00:19:35,957
Shu Yi. The water is ready.

190
00:19:37,036 --> 00:19:38,762
- Thanks.   - What's wrong?

191
00:19:39,998 --> 00:19:42,236
- Nothing.   - I noticed you haven't been doing too well lately.

192
00:19:42,317 --> 00:19:44,598
- Is it because of work...   - I'm going back to work now.

193
00:20:15,558 --> 00:20:16,957
I don't agree, Zheng Shu Yi.

194
00:20:17,318 --> 00:20:19,148
Do you know what you are talking about?

195
00:20:19,917 --> 00:20:21,878
Who insisted on doing this special report back then?

196
00:20:21,997 --> 00:20:24,787
Who insisted on creating an independent and upgraded digital magazine?

197
00:20:24,877 --> 00:20:27,348
Have you forgotten what you said? And now, you want to quit.

198
00:20:27,597 --> 00:20:28,947
I don't agree.

199
00:20:30,637 --> 00:20:31,987
Ms. Yi.

200
00:20:32,318 --> 00:20:33,958
Now, only if I quit,

201
00:20:34,069 --> 00:20:36,109
can we keep the Yunchuang special report.

202
00:20:38,677 --> 00:20:40,027
You and Shi Yan...

203
00:20:44,044 --> 00:20:45,808
You have to think it through.

204
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,402
This special report is hard work.

205
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:50,562
Let the other colleagues handle it.

206
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,988
I will help them finish this project.

207
00:20:56,917 --> 00:20:58,267
Let me think about it.

208
00:20:59,278 --> 00:21:00,628
You should think about it too.

209
00:21:17,613 --> 00:21:18,892
Chairman Shi.

210
00:21:18,973 --> 00:21:20,597
Shi Yan is my junior.

211
00:21:20,677 --> 00:21:23,278
So, while I'm speaking here, I won't beat around the bush.

212
00:21:24,637 --> 00:21:25,987
The situation is like this.

213
00:21:26,397 --> 00:21:29,077
Shi Yan has ignored the fatty meat of Lieying

214
00:21:29,157 --> 00:21:30,598
and had to invest in Le'an.

215
00:21:30,718 --> 00:21:33,398
We seniors didn't understand, but we still supported it.

216
00:21:33,478 --> 00:21:34,517
Yes.

217
00:21:34,597 --> 00:21:35,957
But do you know the result?

218
00:21:36,597 --> 00:21:39,317
The result is that the core personnel of Le'an were poached,

219
00:21:39,397 --> 00:21:42,148
leading to the lab being shut down immediately.

220
00:21:43,357 --> 00:21:45,747
The same goes for Zhanlan.

221
00:21:46,478 --> 00:21:48,868
Juhe's foundation is still shallow.

222
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,200
Who can guarantee it won't be the next Le'an?

223
00:21:51,278 --> 00:21:52,557
Right.

224
00:21:52,637 --> 00:21:53,676
Chairman Shi.

225
00:21:53,762 --> 00:21:56,158
We seniors have considered the situation, and we have a request.

226
00:21:56,238 --> 00:21:57,438
Would you please consider it?

227
00:21:57,518 --> 00:22:00,998
We'd like to have Xiao Ming manage all of Yunchuang's businesses

228
00:22:01,078 --> 00:22:03,717
in order to prevent Shi Yan from making mistakes again

229
00:22:03,877 --> 00:22:05,962
due to lack of experience.

230
00:22:16,238 --> 00:22:17,588
Tian,

231
00:22:18,885 --> 00:22:21,366
do you remember what you said

232
00:22:21,917 --> 00:22:25,547
in my office more than 10 years ago?

233
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,840
Chairman Shi. It's been so many years. I don't remember what I said.

234
00:22:30,278 --> 00:22:31,638
You said,

235
00:22:31,877 --> 00:22:33,957
"Xiao Ming is still young,

236
00:22:34,117 --> 00:22:35,558
and his foundation is not stable.

237
00:22:35,758 --> 00:22:38,077
Now, if we let him enter the management,

238
00:22:38,157 --> 00:22:40,037
it's inevitable that he will lack experience

239
00:22:40,117 --> 00:22:41,957
and make wrong decisions."

240
00:22:51,367 --> 00:22:52,602
Shi Yan.

241
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:56,040
These seniors have been supporting you all this way.

242
00:22:56,197 --> 00:22:57,638
Whatever they said,

243
00:22:57,996 --> 00:23:00,505
if true, correct them.

244
00:23:00,958 --> 00:23:02,318
Otherwise, take it as an advice.

245
00:23:06,917 --> 00:23:08,558
We need many people

246
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:12,227
to escort and protect this small boat of Yunchuang,

247
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,437
so it can grow into a giant ship.

248
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,038
Thank you, seniors, for your concern.

249
00:23:28,502 --> 00:23:31,012
Whether it's investing in Le'an or Juhe,

250
00:23:31,093 --> 00:23:32,814
it was all my own decision.

251
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:35,358
I should take all the responsibility.

252
00:23:35,518 --> 00:23:38,878
I will think of a solution to Le'an's problem as soon as possible

253
00:23:39,278 --> 00:23:40,802
and give everyone an explanation.

254
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,622
This special report has been followed up by Zheng Shu Yi all along.

255
00:23:43,703 --> 00:23:46,132
No one can do this special report better than her.

256
00:23:47,798 --> 00:23:50,078
I won't let the magazine retract the report.

257
00:23:53,293 --> 00:23:55,442
I can't arrange it like this.

258
00:23:58,078 --> 00:23:59,677
I'll have to talk to her.

259
00:24:08,637 --> 00:24:10,837
He doesn't even want to see me now.

260
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,491
He even blocked me.

261
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:14,437
He doesn't even reply to my emails.

262
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:16,318
I have no choice.

263
00:24:17,677 --> 00:24:20,638
I just hope it won't affect the cooperation on this special report.

264
00:24:22,157 --> 00:24:24,437
How did it come to this?

265
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:26,598
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

266
00:24:29,998 --> 00:24:31,717
I don't know what to do either.

267
00:24:32,165 --> 00:24:35,925
(I can't pretend to sympathize with you and comfort you.)

268
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,000
All I can say is

269
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:42,677
that's how things are now.

270
00:24:43,117 --> 00:24:44,467
Do you know that

271
00:24:44,837 --> 00:24:46,917
he took his niece away,

272
00:24:46,998 --> 00:24:48,922
not wanting her to stay with me.

273
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:52,478
(He doesn't want to hear anything about me anymore.)

274
00:24:52,597 --> 00:24:54,722
Don't be too sad.

275
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,802
Maybe if you meet him in person, things will be much better.

276
00:24:58,278 --> 00:25:00,668
How do I muster the courage to go see him?

277
00:25:01,357 --> 00:25:03,237
Whenever I think of him not wanting to see me,

278
00:25:03,364 --> 00:25:04,714
I feel so bad.

279
00:25:05,551 --> 00:25:06,642
Then, don't think about him.

280
00:25:06,723 --> 00:25:08,892
Think about Yue Xing Zhou and Qin...

281
00:25:08,973 --> 00:25:10,357
What's her name again?

282
00:25:10,437 --> 00:25:11,918
(They are the ones suffering now.)

283
00:25:11,998 --> 00:25:14,597
(They must not be able to eat their meals and sleep well now.)

284
00:25:14,678 --> 00:25:16,202
What about this? After work,

285
00:25:16,283 --> 00:25:17,882
go home and take a shower.

286
00:25:18,294 --> 00:25:21,158
Order some small lobsters, watch some variety shows, and sleep.

287
00:25:21,238 --> 00:25:22,997
Maybe, there will be a turnaround.

288
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:24,838
Impossible.

289
00:25:25,397 --> 00:25:28,157
There's no way he and I can be together again.

290
00:25:29,704 --> 00:25:31,974
All right, I'll hang up now. I'm going to work.

291
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,630
Have you figured it out?

292
00:26:00,677 --> 00:26:01,958
It's better to let other colleagues

293
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:03,598
take over the special report on Yunchuang.

294
00:26:04,199 --> 00:26:05,556
I'll do the handover.

295
00:26:05,637 --> 00:26:08,238
If there's anything I can help with later, I'll do my best.

296
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:09,682
No need to credit me.

297
00:26:10,509 --> 00:26:13,962
I just hope the Yunchuang project can continue.

298
00:26:17,758 --> 00:26:19,398
Let's do it as you said.

299
00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:23,467
Prepare the materials in your hand. I'll arrange the handover.

300
00:26:25,397 --> 00:26:26,562
Okay.

301
00:26:37,798 --> 00:26:38,922
Shu Yi.

302
00:26:39,318 --> 00:26:40,878
What did the editor say to you?

303
00:26:42,253 --> 00:26:44,402
I'm going to quit the special report on Yunchuang.

304
00:26:44,612 --> 00:26:45,842
What?

305
00:26:46,508 --> 00:26:49,348
Just for you to say it like that, I feel sorry for you.

306
00:26:51,672 --> 00:26:53,242
Xu Yu Ling must have said bad things about you

307
00:26:53,318 --> 00:26:54,677
in front of the editor-in-chief.

308
00:26:54,811 --> 00:26:56,661
Otherwise, the editor wouldn't have arranged this.

309
00:26:56,796 --> 00:26:58,277
She doesn't understand Yunchuang at all.

310
00:26:58,357 --> 00:26:59,878
How will she do this special report?

311
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,559
What's the situation with Yunchuang?

312
00:27:12,837 --> 00:27:15,078
Why is Shu Yi quitting the special report on Yunchuang?

313
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:17,882
What?

314
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:21,085
When were they together?

315
00:27:22,278 --> 00:27:24,157
Why did they fall out then?

316
00:27:46,157 --> 00:27:49,077
Hello, everyone. Today, we are talking about the secondary market.

317
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,842
Let's look at the screen together.

318
00:27:51,917 --> 00:27:53,267
What is the secondary market?

319
00:27:57,498 --> 00:27:58,511
For Yunchuang's report,

320
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,480
you gave us two copies of Zhanlan's accident investigation report.

321
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,998
The contents are contradictory.

322
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:03,429
Do I need to waste my time

323
00:28:03,917 --> 00:28:05,517
looking at these worthless things?

324
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:10,910
Zhanlan was a company Yunchuang had an intention to invest in.

325
00:28:11,078 --> 00:28:12,756
Regarding the reasons for contradictions,

326
00:28:12,837 --> 00:28:14,358
I have already marked them in the documents.

327
00:28:14,478 --> 00:28:16,918
- You can take a closer look.   - No need. Thank you.

328
00:28:16,998 --> 00:28:18,477
I'll just rely on myself.

329
00:28:19,247 --> 00:28:21,162
I can have my own working methods.

330
00:28:21,357 --> 00:28:25,557
To create a good report, the journalist must understand the issue in depth.

331
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,398
Your plan won't work.

332
00:28:28,877 --> 00:28:31,068
- What do you mean?   - Nothing.

333
00:28:31,687 --> 00:28:35,156
You thought I didn't know how you got the special report from Shi Yan?

334
00:28:38,181 --> 00:28:39,402
With such unorthodox methods,

335
00:28:39,483 --> 00:28:41,833
the opportunity you got will eventually be lost.

336
00:28:45,726 --> 00:28:48,366
In the future, Yunchuang's special report will have nothing to do with you.

337
00:29:02,837 --> 00:29:06,158
Send the materials to my email and then notify Guan Ji and Yu You.

338
00:29:06,239 --> 00:29:07,589
Yes, Mr. Shi.

339
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:12,348
Hello, Mr. Shi. Long time no see. Do you still remember me?

340
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:16,597
I'm Xu Yu Ling, a journalist from Financial Introduce.

341
00:29:16,677 --> 00:29:19,348
I will be responsible for the special reports on Yunchuang in the future.

342
00:29:20,157 --> 00:29:21,158
Miss Xu, please go back.

343
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,562
The collaboration between Yunchuang and Financial Introduce

344
00:29:22,643 --> 00:29:23,962
has already ended.

345
00:29:25,998 --> 00:29:29,239
Mr. Shi. I've done a lot of preparation work. Through my special interview,

346
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,154
I will definitely bring a lot of attention to Yunchuang.

347
00:29:31,235 --> 00:29:33,119
I won't take up too much of your time.

348
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,711
Mr. Shi. The interview we agreed on for this afternoon...

349
00:29:37,888 --> 00:29:39,767
Mr. Shi is leaving. Let's call it a day, Miss Zheng.

350
00:29:39,848 --> 00:29:41,089
The interview is over.

351
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:43,410
I've been looking forward to this for a long time.

352
00:29:43,558 --> 00:29:44,917
Finally, it's happening today.

353
00:29:45,318 --> 00:29:47,278
Is it convenient for you now?

354
00:29:50,928 --> 00:29:53,328
It'll only take a little bit of your time.

355
00:29:53,454 --> 00:29:54,804
Is that okay?

356
00:29:58,318 --> 00:30:01,357
For the same project, I won't accept interviews from two journalists.

357
00:30:01,437 --> 00:30:02,597
Thank you for your hard work.

358
00:30:02,677 --> 00:30:05,638
Mr. Shi, if you don't have time, I can interview your colleagues.

359
00:30:05,718 --> 00:30:07,557
Can you please give me a chance?

360
00:30:07,667 --> 00:30:08,668
Sorry, Miss Xu.

361
00:30:08,757 --> 00:30:10,362
I'm afraid you have to return with nothing.

362
00:30:10,718 --> 00:30:13,478
Mr. Chen, I really won't take up much of Mr. Shi's time.

363
00:30:13,558 --> 00:30:14,718
Can you help me arrange it?

364
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:16,638
I can interview your colleagues. Is that okay?

365
00:30:16,718 --> 00:30:17,842
Sorry.

366
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,310
I...

367
00:30:19,837 --> 00:30:21,798
Miss Xu, let me take you downstairs.

368
00:30:25,318 --> 00:30:27,157
Can I have a few minutes to talk with you?

369
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:48,162
Shu Yi.

370
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,341
Xu Yu Ling went to Yunchuang.

371
00:30:51,758 --> 00:30:53,517
How can you still sit here calmly?

372
00:30:53,597 --> 00:30:55,398
She must have interviewed Shi Yan.

373
00:30:56,379 --> 00:30:58,579
No. You have to take back the special report on Yunchuang.

374
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,010
This is your hard work.

375
00:31:01,572 --> 00:31:02,842
No need.

376
00:31:03,357 --> 00:31:05,158
As long as the special report can proceed smoothly,

377
00:31:05,245 --> 00:31:06,595
it doesn't matter who does it.

378
00:31:22,437 --> 00:31:23,787
Why did you come here?

379
00:31:23,958 --> 00:31:25,308
To pick you up from work.

380
00:31:26,397 --> 00:31:28,628
You should go back. I have to go home and write an article.

381
00:31:30,907 --> 00:31:33,787
What if I say I can take you to find some inspiration?

382
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:36,082
I'm a professional journalist.

383
00:31:36,226 --> 00:31:38,667
I don't need such unprofessional methods to find inspiration.

384
00:31:38,917 --> 00:31:40,267
Are you sure?

385
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,640
Shu Yi?

386
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,559
Is the person next to her

387
00:32:09,471 --> 00:32:11,311
Yi Yang from Dark Horse Technology?

388
00:32:12,881 --> 00:32:16,084
Wow. They really are a perfect match.

389
00:32:16,216 --> 00:32:17,456
How is it perfect?

390
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,161
Clearly, it's not perfect at all.

391
00:32:19,801 --> 00:32:22,721
Why is Miss Zheng with him?

392
00:32:23,656 --> 00:32:25,242
Is there a problem?

393
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,119
Since Mr. Shi accepted an interview with others,

394
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,242
why can't Shu Yi be with others?

395
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:32,713
When did Mr. Shi accept interviews from others?

396
00:32:32,976 --> 00:32:34,642
About Miss Xu that you mentioned,

397
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,439
Mr. Shi didn't even pay attention to her.

398
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,833
Then, why is she still visiting your company every day?

399
00:32:39,914 --> 00:32:42,354
If she's not looking for Mr. Shi, could she possibly be looking for you?

400
00:32:42,478 --> 00:32:43,828
No.

401
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,761
How could she be looking for me?

402
00:32:46,735 --> 00:32:49,202
Do you know how much effort Shu Yi has put into this special report?

403
00:32:49,283 --> 00:32:51,443
But the moment Mr. Shi said to stop it, things had to end.

404
00:32:51,656 --> 00:32:53,375
He's really cold-hearted.

405
00:32:54,416 --> 00:32:58,202
For me, when it comes to love, it should be happy and joyful.

406
00:32:58,302 --> 00:33:00,450
I think this Yi Yang is pretty good.

407
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:02,038
He's handsome and considerate

408
00:33:02,157 --> 00:33:03,878
and still finds time to take care of his girl.

409
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,760
Mr. Shi must have his reasons.

410
00:33:08,873 --> 00:33:11,392
Do you really think he's good?

411
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:15,301
Yes.

412
00:33:19,314 --> 00:33:21,874
But I already have my own little boy.

413
00:33:24,184 --> 00:33:26,840
- Let's go eat.   - Yeah.

414
00:33:26,917 --> 00:33:28,267
- Let's go.  - Let's go.

415
00:33:31,399 --> 00:33:33,948
Weren't we going to find inspiration? Why are we shopping now?

416
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:35,353
It's still early.

417
00:33:35,442 --> 00:33:36,792
Why don't we watch a movie?

418
00:33:37,877 --> 00:33:38,962
Yi Yang.

419
00:33:39,929 --> 00:33:41,129
It's fine if you don't want to.

420
00:33:41,209 --> 00:33:42,559
Shall we go to the night market then?

421
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,400
I don't like night markets.

422
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:45,831
And, there's nothing to buy.

423
00:33:46,455 --> 00:33:49,359
Don't girls usually like to go to night markets?

424
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:53,042
Maybe you'll find something you want to buy there.

425
00:33:53,123 --> 00:33:54,722
I'm not a typical girl.

426
00:33:54,917 --> 00:33:57,839
Who goes shopping for inspiration? I don't have any inspiration at all.

427
00:34:01,758 --> 00:34:05,828
Excuse me. I really have work to do. I'm going home first.

428
00:34:07,038 --> 00:34:09,198
If this place can't give you inspiration,

429
00:34:09,558 --> 00:34:10,908
then let's go somewhere else.

430
00:34:14,151 --> 00:34:15,792
Come on. Punch toward the target.

431
00:34:16,001 --> 00:34:17,561
One. Two. Good.

432
00:34:17,797 --> 00:34:18,998
One. Two. Three.

433
00:34:19,078 --> 00:34:20,162
Not bad.

434
00:34:20,757 --> 00:34:22,158
Come on. Keep changing positions.

435
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:24,398
One. Two. Three.

436
00:34:24,478 --> 00:34:25,828
Keep going.

437
00:34:26,916 --> 00:34:28,716
Switch. One. Two.

438
00:34:29,078 --> 00:34:30,428
One. Two.

439
00:34:30,797 --> 00:34:32,147
One. Two. Three.

440
00:34:32,524 --> 00:34:33,874
One. Two. Three.

441
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,318
One. Two. Three. Four.

442
00:34:35,398 --> 00:34:37,398
Good. Keep going. One. Two. Three. Four.

443
00:34:37,478 --> 00:34:38,828
Switch.

444
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,270
One. Two.

445
00:35:00,237 --> 00:35:01,587
How's that?

446
00:35:02,117 --> 00:35:04,158
It feels pretty good. Thanks.

447
00:35:09,158 --> 00:35:10,508
Now that

448
00:35:10,677 --> 00:35:11,758
all the worries are gone,

449
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:13,189
inspiration will come naturally.

450
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:16,482
If you ever have unhappy times in the future, come to me.

451
00:35:17,038 --> 00:35:18,637
I'll be your human punching bag.

452
00:35:25,038 --> 00:35:26,388
Greetings, Mr. Shi.

453
00:35:35,237 --> 00:35:36,587
Here she comes again.

454
00:35:36,757 --> 00:35:38,398
It's too frequent.

455
00:35:39,038 --> 00:35:40,825
It won't be for the whole afternoon again, right?

456
00:35:40,906 --> 00:35:42,505
She's asking repetitive questions,

457
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,680
wasting everyone's time.

458
00:35:45,031 --> 00:35:47,661
Miss Zheng has already classified and organized the information.

459
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,442
Go tell her not to come again

460
00:35:51,622 --> 00:35:53,708
and not to send other journalists here.

461
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,481
Let's digest the knowledge points we talked about today.

462
00:36:03,797 --> 00:36:06,477
All right. Today's lesson ends here. Dismissed.

463
00:36:29,822 --> 00:36:30,822
Shu Yi.

464
00:36:30,918 --> 00:36:32,358
I have something I want to ask you.

465
00:36:32,637 --> 00:36:34,868
Do you have time for a dinner together in the evening?

466
00:36:46,117 --> 00:36:47,798
Have you been busy with work lately?

467
00:36:47,878 --> 00:36:49,228
You look really tired.

468
00:36:51,237 --> 00:36:52,478
Tiredness is a good thing.

469
00:36:52,558 --> 00:36:54,077
It's worse to have nothing to do.

470
00:36:57,717 --> 00:36:59,157
Don't you have an intern?

471
00:36:59,237 --> 00:37:01,547
Isn't the intern helping you share some of the work?

472
00:37:02,438 --> 00:37:03,788
Oh, Yue?

473
00:37:03,999 --> 00:37:05,359
She took a long leave.

474
00:37:05,518 --> 00:37:07,547
I don't know when she will come back either.

475
00:37:10,223 --> 00:37:11,584
Nothing is wrong with her.

476
00:37:12,038 --> 00:37:14,677
Her family just worries about her

477
00:37:14,757 --> 00:37:16,477
and wants her to rest more.

478
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:22,157
So,

479
00:37:22,237 --> 00:37:24,077
how is Yunchuang doing recently?

480
00:37:24,478 --> 00:37:27,477
I heard there was some internal disagreement.

481
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:36,758
Shu Yi. Are you asking if Shi Yan is doing okay?

482
00:37:40,117 --> 00:37:42,477
Are you and Shi Yan together now?

483
00:37:44,197 --> 00:37:46,198
It was just barely starting back then.

484
00:37:46,478 --> 00:37:47,717
Now,

485
00:37:47,851 --> 00:37:49,372
it's probably over.

486
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:54,507
Shi Yan isn't a bad-tempered person.

487
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:57,358
Although he looks cool usually,

488
00:37:57,677 --> 00:37:59,398
he won't get angry easily.

489
00:38:00,117 --> 00:38:03,188
He must care about you a lot for him to do this.

490
00:38:03,757 --> 00:38:06,228
If you explain things clearly, it will be all right.

491
00:38:07,958 --> 00:38:09,838
I have already apologized to him,

492
00:38:10,438 --> 00:38:12,517
but he blocked me.

493
00:38:12,717 --> 00:38:14,678
So, I couldn't contact him anymore.

494
00:38:16,277 --> 00:38:17,838
How did you apologize?

495
00:38:18,597 --> 00:38:19,947
I...

496
00:38:23,846 --> 00:38:25,646
After you finished speaking, I realized

497
00:38:25,878 --> 00:38:27,489
perhaps the reason he was angry was because,

498
00:38:27,583 --> 00:38:30,358
after all these things happened, you only cared about your work

499
00:38:30,438 --> 00:38:32,037
and neglected his feelings.

500
00:38:34,518 --> 00:38:35,677
You're right.

501
00:38:35,757 --> 00:38:37,107
It's my fault.

502
00:38:37,862 --> 00:38:38,882
I was only thinking about

503
00:38:38,963 --> 00:38:41,397
solving the problems and impacts caused by this incident

504
00:38:41,478 --> 00:38:44,278
without considering and taking care of

505
00:38:44,558 --> 00:38:46,477
our relationship and his feelings.

506
00:38:48,838 --> 00:38:50,398
I'm really a terrible person.

507
00:38:52,838 --> 00:38:54,358
Since you now understand the situation,

508
00:38:54,438 --> 00:38:55,788
do you know what to do now?

509
00:38:58,797 --> 00:39:00,238
Thank you, Yu You.

510
00:39:02,878 --> 00:39:05,663
I didn't expect Professor Yu to be so adept

511
00:39:05,744 --> 00:39:07,118
at solving relationship problems.

512
00:39:08,918 --> 00:39:10,798
I only recently realized

513
00:39:11,078 --> 00:39:13,557
that theories are meaningless when it comes to love.

514
00:39:13,637 --> 00:39:14,677
When you're in it,

515
00:39:14,757 --> 00:39:16,278
you just have to go with the flow.

516
00:39:17,078 --> 00:39:18,197
That's right.

517
00:39:18,277 --> 00:39:19,627
Presuppositions are indeed useless.

518
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:23,442
I never thought I'd ever be with someone like Shi Yan.

519
00:39:44,041 --> 00:39:46,157
- Is it cold?   - Not really.

520
00:39:46,237 --> 00:39:47,802
Let's go over there and take a look.

521
00:39:47,883 --> 00:39:49,042
No.

522
00:39:58,757 --> 00:40:00,077
- Hello.   - (Mr. Shi.)

523
00:40:00,157 --> 00:40:01,811
(I've contacted Financial Introduce.)

524
00:40:01,892 --> 00:40:02,913
(Lv said )

525
00:40:02,994 --> 00:40:05,602
(Miss Zheng voluntarily withdrew from the special report on Yunchuang.)

526
00:40:06,878 --> 00:40:08,082
Got it.

527
00:40:16,558 --> 00:40:18,389
(Perhaps the reason he was angry was because, )

528
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:20,386
(after all these things happened, )

529
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:21,918
(you only cared about your work)

530
00:40:21,999 --> 00:40:23,598
(and neglected his feelings.)

531
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,479
But, what can I do to make you understand that I care about you?

532
00:42:13,038 --> 00:42:14,117
(Lv said)

533
00:42:14,197 --> 00:42:16,908
(Miss Zheng voluntarily withdrew from the special report on Yunchuang.)

534
00:42:31,117 --> 00:42:35,788
Uncle, why aren't you turning on the lights? You scared me!

535
00:42:42,197 --> 00:42:44,637
Uncle, are you feeling down?

536
00:42:47,478 --> 00:42:49,077
Sorry. I shouldn't ask.

537
00:42:51,518 --> 00:42:52,868
Let me ask you.

538
00:42:54,757 --> 00:42:56,158
If a girl

539
00:42:56,358 --> 00:42:59,188
used to be very proactive in pursuing a man,

540
00:42:59,398 --> 00:43:00,748
but then...

541
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:04,437
But then, they had some issues.

542
00:43:05,277 --> 00:43:07,889
So, the girl completely stopped contacting him.

543
00:43:08,078 --> 00:43:09,428
What could be the reason?

544
00:43:10,438 --> 00:43:11,957
What kind of reason could there be?

545
00:43:12,677 --> 00:43:14,477
Being proactive can be tiring too.

546
00:43:14,998 --> 00:43:16,557
In a relationship,

547
00:43:16,797 --> 00:43:19,037
the man should also take the initiative sometimes.

548
00:43:19,157 --> 00:43:21,318
Shouldn't it be the man's turn to take the initiative now?
