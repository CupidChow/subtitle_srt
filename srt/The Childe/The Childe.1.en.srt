That we used to dealing with 
That Japanese group before.

5
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,780
Of course, I’ve tied him up.

6
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,200
But he seems obedient,
Compared to what you said.

7
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,020
Yeah, there’s no problem.

8
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,450
He will be with us.

9
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,270
However,
He seems cunning.

10
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,280
What I mean is,
He seems to be an interesting person.

11

But…

12

How much is he worth?

13
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:23,350
I know that he’s really valuable. 

14

All of his clothes are branded.

Is that so?

16
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,850

18
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,740

335
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,240
Who the fuck are you?

336
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:53,750
I told you that I’m a Chingu! 

337
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:54,250
Friend

338
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,540
But I guess I’m the last friend…

339
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,250
That you meet in your life!

340
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:01,920
What?

341
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:06,670
You might think that we’re the same age, somehow…

342
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:08,590
I may look so young…

343
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,180
But actually I’m quite old.

343
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:14,270
So, because I said so,
Don’t treat me like your friend.

345
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:16,890
I hate ungrateful people.

346
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:18,640
What the fuck are you all about?

347
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:20,440
Who said I’m gonna be your friend?

348
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:24,150
Life doesn’t go as you wish, buddy.

349
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,360
Anyway,
Your pronunciation is great!

350
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:27,570
Good.

351
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,990
What the fuck are you taking about?!

352
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:33,790
Excuse me sir,
Can you go back to your sit?

353
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:34,160
Yeah.

354
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,330
Thank you.

355
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,470
I mean,
Just think about it…

356
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,050
Don’t you find it odd?

357
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,930
Traveling to another country…

358
00:32:54,600 --> 00:33:00,100
Is not as easy as entering a bar or a casino!

359
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:02,020
It requires visa and passport.

360
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,150
Don’t you find it strange?
Just use that brain!

361
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,160
Do you want me to tell you that?

362
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:25,590
I’m leaving.

363
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,380
See you later.

364
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,100
Crazy fuck!

365
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:00,500
We’ve just arrived.

366
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,290
No, I’ll send someone.

367
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,000
Where are you?

368
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:09,010
Me?
I have a meeting.

369
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,340
Okay.

370
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:16,850
Okay.

371
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,440
Did you take care of those people?

372
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,940
Then Why did you come back this soon?

373
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,780don’t worry!
I did everything I’ve been told.
One by one.

374
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,860
I didn’t left any traces.

375
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,370
Like,
We have never been there before!

376
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:41,450
So, my mission is over now,
Right?

377
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,210
Our mission never ends.

378
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,170
-Okay!
-is it him?

379
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,130
Yes.

380
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,840
Get in the car!
Hurry up!

381
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,840
Alright,
I’m hanging up.

382
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,890
Call you later.

383
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:25,160
Wow, he’s so handsome.

384
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:26,960
What celebrity does he remind you of?

385
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,750
Take a closer look.
What do you think?

386
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,590
They’re alike, right?

387
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,380
Like who?

388
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,340
Unnie!
You don’t know anything about celebrities, right?

389
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:38,590
How boring!

390
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,260
He’s such a hottie!

391
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:45,270
Look at those muscles!
It’s making me crazy!

392
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:48,770
So?

393
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:50,520
What should I so?

394
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:51,940
About what?

395
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,280
Just do what you’re told.

396
00:35:59,370 --> 00:35:59,870
Okay.

397
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:03,040
Wow!
By the way Unnie…

398
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:07,750
What about the favor I asked?

399
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,550
I brought it.

400
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:17,010
But,
Do you really need it?

401
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:18,430
Just in case anything happens.

402
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,550
I’m being cautious.

403
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,050
prevention is better than cure.

404
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:24,020
Don’t worry.
I’ve practice it a lot.

405
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:26,390
Damn it!
It’s going late for my class.

406
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:28,640
I’ve got to go.
Thank you.

407
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,770

415

Director han!

416
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,510
Why are you doing this to me?

417
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:29,520
Director han,
What the hell are you doing?

418
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,850
Do you know what a big mistake
 you’ve committed?

419
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,150
Do you know who I am?!

420
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,070
How will you face the consequences?

421
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,820
Hey, that’s enough.

422
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,280
Can you shut up please?

423
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,370
Your fucking mouth stinks!

424
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:51,870
What should I do first?

425
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,460
You two know each other, right?

426
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,880
So why are you pretending like you don’t?!

427
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:20,610
If that’s so,
Then why do you look so close in these pictures? 

428
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,780
It seems that you’re close.

429
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,570
It’s obvious.

430
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:31,330
it's really a shame for 
such a high-ranked person like you!

431
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:34,790
Am I right, Mr editor in charge? 

432
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000

Yeah.

443
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:13,740
How long have you
known my father for?

444
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:16,960
It’s around 19 or 20 years, right?

That you could make your own side?

Let me explain.

452
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:39,190
You thought that you’ll win, right?

453
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,650
That’s why you’re standing 
shamelessly in front of me?

454
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:44,150
Director han.
I’m begging you.

455
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,110
Let me explain it for once.

456
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:49,150
I have to explain.
I’ve got things to say.

Hey,

00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:03,800
-Cypress.
-yeah…

463
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,430
There’s a Cypress forest.

00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,820
You said it’s a sensitive time!

476
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:04,940
Well…

477
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:07,990
Don’t worry about your family,

But also for your children.

So,
Rest assured.

Both of you…

486
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:28,930
Disappeared!
For the sake of your families.

487
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:30,760
No one will ever look for you.

488
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:32,300
Do they even want to?

489
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,520

How dare you to stare rudely like that?

01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,520
Enough!
Let’s stop chasing and running!

670
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:42,490
I said stop!

671
01:02:43,950 --> 01:02:46,030
If you do not cooperate,

672
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:49,660
Then I’ll smash 
your fucking head into wall!

673
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:54,260
You don’t need to pose like that!

674
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:01,720
You were a boxer, right?

675
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:11,460
Ouch!
It really hurts!

676
01:03:14,030 --> 01:03:15,830
One punch is enough to get killed!

677
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:32,550
Get in the car!

678
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:46,130
Gosh!

679
01:03:56,600 --> 01:04:00,000
My dear car! Damn it!
I’ve just bought it!

680
01:04:06,890 --> 01:04:08,600
Fuck it!

681
01:04:22,290 --> 01:04:23,630
Who the hell is that guy?

682
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:26,090
What is going on here?

683
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:29,060
You called me with that card today, right?

684
01:04:30,290 --> 01:04:32,350
Gosh.

685
01:04:35,490 --> 01:04:37,060
Don’t you remember me?

686
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:41,580
I’m sorry…

687
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:43,060
Are you okay?

688
01:04:43,290 --> 01:04:45,550
I’m sorry!
I didn’t see you coming!

689
01:04:46,060 --> 01:04:47,030
Kopino!

690
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:49,150
You’re a Kopino, right?

691
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:56,260
Who are you?

692
01:04:56,860 --> 01:04:57,860
Who the fuck are you guys?

693
01:04:58,030 --> 01:04:59,400
Don’t rush it!

694
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:01,490
You’ll find it out before you die.

695
01:05:01,490 --> 01:05:02,430
What?

696
01:05:09,230 --> 01:05:10,800
It’s so amusing!

697
01:05:14,230 --> 01:05:15,920
Who is that fucker?

698
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:24,630
Hey!
Turn the car around!

699
01:05:27,350 --> 01:05:28,550
Why they’re together?

700
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:30,460
Hey!
Chase them!

701
01:05:39,230 --> 01:05:40,800
Where are we going?

702
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,230
To your daddy.

703
01:05:42,890 --> 01:05:44,950
You came here to see your dad,

704
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:46,320
Right?

705
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:49,030
That guy who is chasing us,
Is your brother.

706
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:53,520
He was the one 
who ordered to bring you here.

707
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,060
He can’t stand still.

708
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:02,400
Are you playing with me? 

709
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:03,400
Do you think I’m joking?

710
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:04,400
What should we do now?

711
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:07,180
I don’t have time to play with you.

712
01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:07,980
What?

713
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:12,180
So, what is this all about?

714
01:06:12,290 --> 01:06:13,180
What?

715
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:14,950
I’m just doing my job.

716
01:06:14,950 --> 01:06:15,660
Is there any problem?

717
01:06:16,150 --> 01:06:19,350
I told you to catch that bastard
Then hand him over to me!

718
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:20,290
Did you forget?

719
01:06:21,490 --> 01:06:23,400
Go and ask lawyer kang about it.

720
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:23,950
What?

721
01:06:23,950 --> 01:06:25,350
Ask lawyer kang…

722
01:06:25,350 --> 01:06:26,550
Not me.

723
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:27,320
What?

724
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:29,630
I’ve told you many times!

725
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:31,230
Just because we share same offices,

726
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:32,720
That doesn’t mean we’re partners!

727
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:33,830
Are you out of your mind?
You crazy bitch?

728
01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:36,780
Do you wanna die?
Huh?

729
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:39,290
Catch me and kill me if you can!

730
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:42,780
Hello?
Hello?

731
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:46,920
That crazy whore!

732
01:06:47,350 --> 01:06:49,860
Hey, chase them!

733
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:14,600
Hold it tight!

734
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:19,400
Faster!
Get closer to them!

735
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:29,830
Careful!

736
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:44,800
Why are you standing still?
Hurry up!

737
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:46,030
That fucking bitch!

738
01:07:46,030 --> 01:07:47,260
Hurry up!

739
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:17,520
Catch them, you asshole!
What’s wrong with you?

740
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:46,180
Fuck!

741
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:50,780
Look at these fuckers!

742
01:08:50,780 --> 01:08:52,600
They’re driving like they’re high or sth.

743
01:08:52,780 --> 01:08:55,120
I can’t believe it!
I’m speechless!

744
01:08:59,690 --> 01:09:03,120
What’s wrong with this Benz?

745
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:32,230
I scared to death!

746
01:09:33,150 --> 01:09:35,290
Fuck!

747
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,030
Where did they go?

748
01:09:55,550 --> 01:09:57,720
I asked you jerk!
Where did they go?

750
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:14,000
That fucker was pretty fast too.

751
01:10:18,630 --> 01:10:19,750
Where is my father?

752
01:10:22,030 --> 01:10:23,400
Didn’t you tell we’re heading to him?

753
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,350
Your father?

754
01:10:28,090 --> 01:10:30,260
Somewhere like here.

755
01:10:37,950 --> 01:10:39,200
Your dad…

756
01:10:40,690 --> 01:10:43,980
is in a mountain house 
with great weather and air like here.

757
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:49,980
Yet, he’s slowly dying.

758
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:54,120
What’s wrong with that face?

759
01:10:54,260 --> 01:10:55,720
Lawyer kang didn’t tell you?

760
01:10:56,860 --> 01:10:59,180
Chairman han, your father,
Is dying.

761
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:02,800
I heard his heart doesn’t working.

762
01:11:04,710 --> 01:11:09,370
Did you know that your father is the CEO of a great company in Seoul?

763
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:12,140
Hogyeong company…

764
01:11:12,450 --> 01:11:14,880
Has many universities and surrounding areas in Seoul…

765
01:11:15,050 --> 01:11:16,770
As well as many hospitals.

766
01:11:16,970 --> 01:11:19,000
In a nutshell,
It’s a very big company.

767
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,770
It’s not something ordinary!

768
01:11:22,770 --> 01:11:24,680
You didn’t know, right?

769
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:28,280
You thought that your father 
is just wealthy enough and that’s all?

770
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:30,280
If that was the case…

771
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:32,280
It would be really good.

772
01:11:32,510 --> 01:11:34,140
But, unfortunately,
It’s not.

773
01:11:34,340 --> 01:11:35,740
Right, huh?

774
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:38,970
If it was the whole story…

775
01:11:38,970 --> 01:11:41,080
Then why did he 
have to take such risks to find you?!

776
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:49,170
Your father and your brother,
They’re in such a hurry!

777
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:51,540
If your father die now…

778
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:56,510
Your brother won’t even get a penny 
of the whole company!

779
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,650
Consider it as,
While CEO han is taking his last breaths…

780
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,740
His current wife,
Ms.Jeong…

781
01:12:01,740 --> 01:12:06,140
Is sealing his will
And signing the death certificate.

782
01:12:07,420 --> 01:12:11,080
That’s why your brother 
is doing his best to prevent his death!

783
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:12,620
Literally anything!

784
01:12:14,770 --> 01:12:16,280
Fucking bastard.

785
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:21,370
That’s why they need you.

786
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:23,480
Did you get it?

787
01:12:24,020 --> 01:12:25,140
What do you…

788
01:12:27,650 --> 01:12:28,420
Mean?

789
01:12:28,420 --> 01:12:32,050
Your father's heart
is not beating properly…

790
01:12:33,770 --> 01:12:35,880
What your father and 
your brother need is…

791
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:39,080
This!

792
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:41,880
Here.

793
01:12:42,250 --> 01:12:44,050
They need your heart

794
01:12:44,770 --> 01:12:46,280
Prepare him for an electric shock!

795
01:12:47,170 --> 01:12:50,850
Check the vitals!

796
01:12:50,850 --> 01:12:53,250
Start the CPR!

797
01:13:24,820 --> 01:13:26,020
Do you get it now?

798
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:30,910
What?

799
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:33,080
Any other questions?

800
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:36,220
Me?

801
01:13:36,740 --> 01:13:39,200
I get money from the opposite side!

802
01:13:41,770 --> 01:13:43,020
It’s good.

803
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:44,820
Just do what you’re told

804
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:48,200
You’re going to die anyway…

805
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:51,200
Sooner or later,
That doesn’t really matter.

806
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:53,080
This way is more peaceful.

807
01:14:10,340 --> 01:14:11,680
Shit!

808
01:14:11,770 --> 01:14:12,800
Fuck!

809
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:15,020
Bastard!

810
01:14:26,850 --> 01:14:28,600
Fuck it!
My car!

811
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:32,650
I’m gonna kill you bitch!

812
01:14:49,170 --> 01:14:51,680
Enough!
You crazy fucker.

813
01:14:54,340 --> 01:14:55,710
How do you want to pay
for my car’s damage?

814
01:14:57,140 --> 01:14:58,200
Damn it!

815
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:46,650
No need to run anymore.

816
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:48,800
It’s hot!

817
01:15:53,870 --> 01:15:55,530
I’m your big brother.

818
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:01,540
And I’m happy to meet you.

819
01:16:04,790 --> 01:16:06,000
Bro.

820
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:46,040
Hurry up!
Go inside!

821
01:16:47,210 --> 01:16:48,000
Come on.

822
01:16:55,430 --> 01:16:56,890
Come on!
Make yourself at home!

823
01:16:57,350 --> 01:16:58,220
Smile!

824
01:16:58,220 --> 01:17:00,310
Make yourself at home!

825
01:17:03,770 --> 01:17:05,560
This kid is covered in shit! 

826
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:13,610
Let’s go upstairs 
And take a look!

827
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:16,740
What do you think?
Is it beautiful?

828
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:19,120
Come here.

829
01:17:24,710 --> 01:17:27,580
Ga young, 
When did you come here?

830
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:30,300
You’re really impressive!

831
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:31,460
How did you find out
That dad has surgery today…

832
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:33,920
And came here immediately?

833
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:37,260
Such a perfect daughter!

834
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:40,180
You’re a perfect son,
Older brother!

835
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:43,180
You finally brought the one
You were looking for!

836
01:17:43,180 --> 01:17:45,730
Of course,
What did you think with yourself?

837
01:17:45,730 --> 01:17:48,150
It’s about my dad’s life!

838
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:51,820
Have you ever seen me failed?

839
01:17:52,030 --> 01:17:53,240
I haven’t.

840
01:17:53,940 --> 01:17:55,780
You’re really awesome.

841
01:17:58,530 --> 01:18:00,080
And, the pillar of this family!

842
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:05,120
All of these assholes around me 
are nothing but pains in my ass!

843
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:06,790
Congratulations.

844
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:13,550
Dongsaeng, why are you 
talking that way to your brother?

845
01:18:13,550 --> 01:18:17,470
Shouldn’t you and your mother 
be more polite from now on?

846
01:18:18,180 --> 01:18:20,100
That fucking girl!

847
01:18:21,050 --> 01:18:24,180
She’s a bitch!
Just like her mother.

848
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:29,020
Let her go.

849
01:18:30,020 --> 01:18:32,610
My Dongsaeng is always like that.

850
01:18:34,030 --> 01:18:35,360
Never mind.

851
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:39,160
It’s time to visit daddy!

852
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:41,120
Let’s go.

853
01:18:42,620 --> 01:18:46,870
Dad,
Your youngest child is here.

854
01:18:58,340 --> 01:18:59,970
Fuck it.

855
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:15,070
<i> the number you’ve called, is not available.</i>

856
01:19:14,870 --> 01:19:17,577
[ Recent calls ]

857
01:19:59,950 --> 01:20:03,620
How does seeing him 
make you feel?

858
01:20:07,990 --> 01:20:09,790
The age gap between you, 
ga young and dad…

859
01:20:09,790 --> 01:20:12,120
Is a lot.

860
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,290
Is it better to call him grandpa?

861
01:20:20,550 --> 01:20:21,760
Come here.

862
01:20:22,180 --> 01:20:26,010
Father and son 
first and last reunion.

863
01:20:26,010 --> 01:20:28,430
We need to take a photo.

864
01:20:30,140 --> 01:20:31,480
Smile, you scum!
Smile, Asshole!

865
01:20:34,940 --> 01:20:35,980
Smile!

866
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:40,320
It’s perfect.

867
01:20:41,780 --> 01:20:44,240
What are you waiting for?
Let’s get started.

868
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:03,430
What?
What?

869
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:05,390
Weren’t you looking for your dad?

870
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:09,580
Aren’t you happy?

871
01:21:12,460 --> 01:21:13,750
Then Compensate his efforts!

872
01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:47,500
How long does it take?

873
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:50,250
Dr. Lee said the surgery will take 9 hours.

874
01:21:54,460 --> 01:21:56,590
We don’t know 
what they’re planning to do…

875
01:21:57,010 --> 01:21:58,550
So, just in case
Put some guards outside.

876
01:21:58,550 --> 01:21:59,670
Yeah

877
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:31,120
Marco

878
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:45,990
The anesthesia doesn't working.

879
01:22:45,990 --> 01:22:47,700
How is it possible?

880
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:49,840
Hey!
You did is properly?

881
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,470
-Yeah!
-Do sth about it!

882
01:22:51,470 --> 01:22:52,090
Yeah!

883
01:22:53,180 --> 01:22:54,760
-Hurry up, you bastard!
-Yeah!

884
01:22:58,680 --> 01:22:59,730
What happened?

885
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:01,940
-Doctor!
-Doctor!

886
01:23:12,530 --> 01:23:14,370
-What happened?
-let’s report it to Mr.Han.

887
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:18,660
What the hell is wrong with you?

888
01:23:28,630 --> 01:23:31,550
Hey! Wake up!
Are you awake?

889
01:23:34,050 --> 01:23:35,930
I’m here, Buddy!


890
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:40,180
You’re happy to see me,
Right?

891
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:42,440
Hurry up,
We don’t have time.

892
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:45,060
Can you stand up by yourself? 

893
01:23:45,610 --> 01:23:46,770
Get up!

894
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:52,700
1,2,3

895
01:23:53,780 --> 01:23:54,990
This asshole…

896
01:23:55,820 --> 01:23:57,240
Look at his thing!

897
01:23:57,330 --> 01:23:59,830
Don’t wander around naked!
Wear sth!!

898
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:12,920
Block the exit!
Hurry up.

899
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:14,130
Yeah.

900
01:24:29,860 --> 01:24:32,280
That fucking man!

901
01:24:46,250 --> 01:24:47,500
You really are…

902
01:24:50,130 --> 01:24:54,050
My father?

903
01:25:09,810 --> 01:25:10,900
What kind of father…

904
01:25:14,570 --> 01:25:15,900
In this damn world,
Kills his son…

905
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:18,620
In order to survive himself?

906
01:25:19,410 --> 01:25:21,410
What kind of father is it?!

907
01:25:25,710 --> 01:25:27,620
Wish you didn’t look for me!

908
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:32,630
If it was the reason….

909
01:25:32,630 --> 01:25:34,460
Wish you didn’t find me!

910
01:25:40,970 --> 01:25:42,010
We don’t have time.

911
01:25:42,010 --> 01:25:43,520
It’s enough.

912
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:45,640
That fucking man!

913
01:25:48,730 --> 01:25:49,690
Give it to me!

914
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:52,480
that brat shouldn't get killed!
Under any circumstances.

915
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:54,150
-Is it clear?
-Yes.

916
01:25:54,150 --> 01:25:56,110
Get out of the way, losers!

917
01:26:03,370 --> 01:26:04,910
Shit!

918
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:13,340
Hey,
Do you hear my me?

919
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:19,630
Why doesn’t anybody respond me?

920
01:26:19,630 --> 01:26:20,720
Does anybody hear me?

921
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:23,300
If you heard, respond me fuckers!
Do you hear me?

922
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:25,010
Yeah,
I hear you!

923
01:26:25,350 --> 01:26:26,680
Very fucking well speech!


924
01:26:27,060 --> 01:26:29,190
Why do you speak in english,
You bastard?

925
01:26:29,190 --> 01:26:32,310
-Speak in Korean, fucker!
-How dare he insults us?

926
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:34,320
I don’t know who the fuck you are…

927
01:26:34,770 --> 01:26:37,150
But let’s talk about it properly 
So we can reach a compromise!

928
01:26:37,490 --> 01:26:40,280
You’re the one who asked for 10 million dollars?

929
01:26:42,410 --> 01:26:43,910
It’s him, fucker!

930
01:26:46,660 --> 01:26:48,000
What should we do now?

931
01:26:48,790 --> 01:26:53,710
Nothing!
We just get out of here.

932
01:26:53,710 --> 01:26:54,710
We will get out of here.

933
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:56,710
Respectfully,
We will leave from the front door.

934
01:26:58,380 --> 01:27:00,430
Come on,
Lead the way!

935
01:27:18,570 --> 01:27:21,610
It’s the first time I’m seeing this bastard.

936
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:26,490
Give me my phone.

937
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:36,590
Ten, hundreds, thousands, millions…

938
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:41,800
Dude, do you know how much ten million dollars would be with the current situation in Korea?

939
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:42,430
Of course I know.

940
01:27:42,430 --> 01:27:45,720
which is equivalent to eleven billion eight hundred and seventy-five million and five hundred thousand won at today's exchange rate.

941
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:51,730
You’ve counted it already!

942
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:56,560
This is a huge amount of money!

943
01:27:57,230 --> 01:27:58,820
A pauper like you,
Doesn’t know how much money it is!

944
01:27:58,820 --> 01:28:01,190
I can not give it to you right away!

945
01:28:01,190 --> 01:28:03,780
Don’t worry!
No need to hurry!

946
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:05,910
I’m not busy today.

947
01:28:07,740 --> 01:28:09,240
Okay.
Okay.

948
01:28:10,290 --> 01:28:12,410
For now, 
I will give you five million on account.

949
01:28:12,710 --> 01:28:13,790
This fucker isn’t even worth it that much!


950
01:28:13,790 --> 01:28:14,870
Don’t you agree?

951
01:28:14,870 --> 01:28:17,920
Then you can have 
half of his heart, on account.

952
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:18,880
10 millions!

953
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:23,380
It’s a bit expensive!

954
01:28:23,380 --> 01:28:24,720
no bargaining.

955
01:28:30,010 --> 01:28:32,180
Isn’t it hard for you to digest?

956
01:28:32,180 --> 01:28:33,560
Don’t worry.

957
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:35,690
My digestive system is perfect!

958
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:41,230
That fucker talks back well!

959
01:28:41,820 --> 01:28:45,070
Okay,
How about 7 millions dollars?

960
01:28:52,540 --> 01:28:54,830
Eyes on the target!

961
01:28:56,250 --> 01:28:57,750
Ready!

962
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:04,170
Fire!

963
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:20,020
Don’t shoot!
Don’t shoot!

964
01:29:20,020 --> 01:29:22,400
Are you out of your fucking mind?

965
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:25,400
That crazy…

966
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:28,700
Fucking bitch!
She’s out of her mind!

967
01:29:34,790 --> 01:29:35,870
What’s with this?

968
01:29:35,870 --> 01:29:38,750
Hurry up!

969
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:41,290
Hurry up!

970
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:49,220
Fuck!
I got shot.

971
01:29:52,100 --> 01:29:55,220
It hurts!
Gosh!

972
01:29:57,190 --> 01:29:58,810
I got shot!

973
01:30:16,700 --> 01:30:19,290
I lost that fucking 10 million dollars.

974
01:30:21,580 --> 01:30:24,460
I was joking!
Don’t look at me this way!

975
01:30:30,580 --> 01:30:32,300
We’re fucked!

975
01:30:32,390 --> 01:30:34,510
Out of the way!

976
01:30:35,010 --> 01:30:36,390
Didn’t you hear me?

977
01:30:37,350 --> 01:30:39,100
Director han!
Director han!

978
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:42,610
Hey!
Be prepared.

979
01:30:42,610 --> 01:30:46,280
What?
Those fuckers!

980
01:30:49,110 --> 01:30:50,490
Son of a bitch!

981
01:30:51,860 --> 01:30:53,120
Calm down, buddies!

982
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:54,330
Why do you point your guns like that?

983
01:30:54,330 --> 01:30:57,080
This guy hasn’t died yet.

984
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:01,460
You guys shot first!
Not me.

985
01:31:04,430 --> 01:31:06,800
You crazy fucker!
What the hell?

986
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,680
What do you want to do?

987
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:11,220
We don’t have time.

988
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:33,330
You want 10 million dollars,
Right, you fucker?

989
01:31:33,330 --> 01:31:35,580
Yeah, 10 millions!
You filthy rich!

990
01:31:36,420 --> 01:31:38,540
Cayman Islands or virgin Islands?

991
01:31:38,540 --> 01:31:39,380
What?

992
01:31:39,380 --> 01:31:41,340
It’s for the dollar transfer account.

993
01:31:41,340 --> 01:31:43,300
Everything has been thought of before.

994
01:31:46,430 --> 01:31:48,050
The choice is yours.
Where?

995
01:31:55,020 --> 01:31:55,640
Cayman.

996
01:31:55,640 --> 01:31:56,640
Alright.

997
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:01,730
Show it to him.

998
01:32:03,740 --> 01:32:06,110
Deposit it there,
Right away.

999
01:32:13,620 --> 01:32:14,790
My phone.

1000
01:32:27,430 --> 01:32:28,760
It’s me.

1001
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:32,260
I will send an account number
Deposit 10 million.

1002
01:32:33,310 --> 01:32:35,390
