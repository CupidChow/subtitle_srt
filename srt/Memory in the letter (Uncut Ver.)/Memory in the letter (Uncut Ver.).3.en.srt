1
00:00:09,833 --> 00:00:10,666
Oh my god!

2
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:13,066
Where did the water come from?

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,600
Oh! AKSORN's books are wet!

4
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:21,766
Oops!

5
00:00:21,766 --> 00:00:24,466
Will he be mad at me?

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,666
All books are wet!

7
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,300
Mr. KYO, Sawasdee krub

8
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:23,133
Sawasdee krub (Hello)

9
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,733
Are you looking for a book or someone else?

10
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,300
I'm...

11
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,566
If you're looking for AKSORN,

12
00:02:32,566 --> 00:02:33,833
He went out.

13
00:03:04,566 --> 00:03:06,966
What's up, AKSORN?

14
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,800
Your car is having issues again.

15
00:03:08,866 --> 00:03:10,766
I was driving just fine, and then it suddenly stalled.

16
00:03:10,766 --> 00:03:14,766
When I tried starting the car again, it just wouldn't start. All I heard was a sputtering noise, and nothing happened.

17
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:21,233
Um, I think the battery might be dead. You may try searching on Google to find a nearby mechanic.

18
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,100
Where are you now?

19
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,866
I don't know where I am.

20
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:47,966
P'NAY...

21
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:49,900
I still can't find a rickshaw.

22
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,033
Could you please send someone to pick me up?

23
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:54,833
Okay, okay.

24
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,366
Oh, P'KYO!

25
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,933
Yes, I am.

26
00:04:13,266 --> 00:04:14,266
What's wrong with your car?

27
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:17,766
The car is broken.

28
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:20,966
How did you get here, then?

29
00:04:20,966 --> 00:04:23,366
I should ask how you ended up here.

30
00:04:23,366 --> 00:04:25,466
It's not a way to reach Nakhon Pathom.

31
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:31,000
Where are you headed? Do you need a ride?

32
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,700
I'm going to see a writer.

33
00:04:34,766 --> 00:04:35,700
A writer?

34
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,400
I didn't mean to request the writer to sign the book.

35
00:04:38,566 --> 00:04:40,900
I want to discuss something with the writer.

36
00:04:43,066 --> 00:04:43,866
I think...

37
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,800
let's go in my car.

38
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,800
Let me go drop you off.

39
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,033
And you're not going to ask me...

40
00:04:50,033 --> 00:04:50,866
what do I have to discuss with the writer?

41
00:04:54,766 --> 00:04:56,166
Just knowing that it's important to you...

42
00:04:57,366 --> 00:04:58,166
that's fine for me.

43
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,466
Hi, Aunt SOOK.

44
00:05:07,566 --> 00:05:08,633
AKSORN...

45
00:05:08,633 --> 00:05:10,433
If you're back around, drop by and see me, okay?

46
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,300
Is something going on?

47
00:05:12,433 --> 00:05:14,300
Today, I went into your room...

48
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:25,166
Thanks so much, P'KYO.

49
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,900
You came up to my room today, right?

50
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,300
Ah, there was a water leak in your room, so I had to come in to sort it out.

51
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,033
But once I came in...

52
00:05:39,466 --> 00:05:41,800
the books got completely soaked,

53
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,400
even though I took them out to dry.

54
00:05:44,866 --> 00:05:48,100
I apologize for not checking the room thoroughly before handing it over to you.

55
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,400
It was my fault.

56
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,466
Oh, it's alright. So, how about the mirror?

57
00:05:53,266 --> 00:05:54,066
Mirror?

58
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,466
The mirror was left by the room's previous owner, wasn't it?

59
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,766
Is it cluttered?

60
00:05:59,766 --> 00:06:00,666
Do you want me to dispose of it?

61
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,466
I'll do it.

62
00:06:01,466 --> 00:06:02,033
No!

63
00:06:02,033 --> 00:06:02,566
It's alright.

64
00:06:02,566 --> 00:06:04,000
I'll do it myself.

65
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,066
Thanks so much.

66
00:06:05,066 --> 00:06:05,766
Are you sure?

67
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:07,033
Don't worry.

68
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,400
Just let me know then.

69
00:06:08,566 --> 00:06:09,366
it's alright!

70
00:06:12,433 --> 00:06:13,233
SONGJAM...

71
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,133
SONGJAM, SONGJAM, SONGJAM...

72
00:06:16,133 --> 00:06:16,533
AKSORN!

73
00:06:16,533 --> 00:06:17,833
Aunt SOOK...

74
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:18,600
Calm down, please.

75
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,400
She didn't see me.

76
00:06:21,266 --> 00:06:23,066
I don't know why.

77
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,766
But she did not see me.

78
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,200
Oh my god!

79
00:06:29,733 --> 00:06:30,866
Where did the water come from?

80
00:06:31,733 --> 00:06:33,500
Oh! AKSORN's books are wet!

81
00:06:37,033 --> 00:06:38,366
Oops!

82
00:06:59,566 --> 00:07:01,500
Why does my face look so dull like this?

83
00:07:01,566 --> 00:07:04,566
Oh no! Wrinkles have completely taken over.

84
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,300
I spent twenty thousand baht!

85
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,666
I need to see the doctor!

86
00:07:10,966 --> 00:07:13,866
Oh no, I need to shut off the water valve first.

87
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,033
Why do you have to make that face?

88
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:29,833
Are you not feeling relaxed like I am?

89
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,666
Yes, but...

90
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,033
I'm confused.

91
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,400
What?

92
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,666
Is it just me who sees you like this?

93
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:47,433
And...

94
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,166
You're not a figment of my imagination, are you?

95
00:08:16,233 --> 00:08:17,033
Can you feel it?

96
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,100
Can you feel that...

97
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,100
I exist?

98
00:08:26,366 --> 00:08:27,466
I'm not so sure.

99
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,200
But I can feel...

100
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,600
How?

101
00:08:35,633 --> 00:08:36,433
I can feel that...

102
00:08:39,266 --> 00:08:40,400
Your hand is warm.

103
00:09:12,766 --> 00:09:13,566
Can you feel it now?

104
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,000
Your hands are warm.

105
00:09:42,066 --> 00:09:44,500
This is your last chance

106
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,233
with the historic meteor shower.

107
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:47,966
You'll have a chance to see it.

108
00:09:47,966 --> 00:09:50,766
last time in the next two nights.

109
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,000
Is your world experiencing a meteor shower lately?

110
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,566
Yes, it was.

111
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,433
Really?

112
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,500
It was the first day we met.

113
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:05,566
It'll happen again in the next two days.

114
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,133
If miracles were real,

115
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,533
in the next two days,

116
00:10:11,133 --> 00:10:13,366
we might just meet for real.

117
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:17,100
Don't give me hope like that.

118
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,466
But our lives can be lived because of hope, can't they?

119
00:10:23,066 --> 00:10:24,900
Impossible hope...

120
00:10:25,466 --> 00:10:27,266
can it be called hope?

121
00:10:29,766 --> 00:10:33,066
That's why it's called a miracle.

122
00:10:35,366 --> 00:10:38,666
If a miracle often happens, as you said,

123
00:10:39,066 --> 00:10:41,033
are you sure that is a so-called miracle?

124
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,000
Yes, of course.

125
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,200
Since I met you...

126
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,566
every day I wake up and see you,

127
00:10:50,633 --> 00:10:52,800
I consider it a miracle for me.

128
00:11:00,866 --> 00:11:02,733
Do you know what you have said?

129
00:11:08,266 --> 00:11:10,433
I've got the whereabouts of that writer.

130
00:11:10,466 --> 00:11:12,700
Did you meet the writer?

131
00:11:14,366 --> 00:11:15,466
No, I didn't.

132
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,700
On top of that, the car broke down, and I almost ended up sleeping in the woods.

133
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,133
So why did you just tell me about this?

134
00:11:23,133 --> 00:11:25,833
At least I came back safe and sound.

135
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:26,700
It doesn't matter if I tell you now or later.

136
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,300
How did you come back?

137
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:35,466
P'KYO.

138
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,733
A regular customer at the bookstore picked me up.

139
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:40,566
P'KYO?

140
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:43,133
Yeah, he is so kind.

141
00:11:43,866 --> 00:11:45,733
We've been seeing each other often lately, too.

142
00:11:45,866 --> 00:11:47,800
Yesterday, if it wasn't for P'KYO,

143
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,266
I can't imagine what it would be like for me.

144
00:11:53,266 --> 00:11:56,966
Tomorrow, he will volunteer to take me to see that writer again.

145
00:11:58,533 --> 00:11:59,333
Really?

146
00:12:01,966 --> 00:12:04,933
He seems like a good person.

147
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:05,533
Yes, he is.

148
00:12:06,066 --> 00:12:08,766
I hope that you have a chance to meet him.

149
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,566
I have to go for a shower.

150
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,300
Oh, please wait.

151
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,566
SONGJAM

152
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,566
SONGJAM

153
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,500
What's wrong with him?

154
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:18,233
[Sweet dream]

155
00:13:26,366 --> 00:13:27,366
I'm here...

156
00:13:28,233 --> 00:13:29,400
Hi, P'KYO.

157
00:13:29,966 --> 00:13:32,366
Sorry for making you wait for so long.

158
00:13:32,533 --> 00:13:34,100
Is the teacher late for class today?

159
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,800
I just can't find a sentence in literature to describe a topic.

160
00:13:37,866 --> 00:13:40,900
I thought this would be easy for you.

161
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,533
Because the more I read,

162
00:13:41,566 --> 00:13:43,200
the harder for me to choose.

163
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,800
Do you want me to choose for you?

164
00:13:47,766 --> 00:13:52,300
That's good. I want to know which sentences regular customers will like.

165
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:57,266
I like Oscar Wilde's sentences.

166
00:13:59,133 --> 00:14:01,633
Keep love in your heart.

167
00:14:01,933 --> 00:14:08,466
A life without love is like a garden without the sun. When the withered flower wilts and dies...

168
00:14:08,633 --> 00:14:10,466
Why do you like these sentences?

169
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,366
Probably because I know very well that

170
00:14:15,233 --> 00:14:17,800
living life like a garden without the sun

171
00:14:17,866 --> 00:14:19,166
will be.

172
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:24,333
Who broke your heart?

173
00:14:25,466 --> 00:14:30,566
I once loved someone, but in the end, I had to lose it.

174
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,200
How about you?

175
00:14:33,933 --> 00:14:35,400
Have you ever loved someone?

176
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,966
Every day I wake up and see you,

177
00:14:46,066 --> 00:14:49,200
I consider it a miracle for me.

178
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:51,800
Yes.

179
00:14:53,566 --> 00:14:56,033
Love even though you know you will lose it.

180
00:15:02,366 --> 00:15:03,166
Shall we go now?

181
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,700
I think...

182
00:15:42,366 --> 00:15:43,200
it's under renovation.

183
00:15:53,033 --> 00:15:53,833
Let's go inside.

184
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,633
Who are you looking for?

185
00:16:05,433 --> 00:16:07,300
Do you know the owner of this building, Aunty?

186
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,400
I'm not aunty.

187
00:16:10,233 --> 00:16:11,400
I don't have any grandchildren yet.

188
00:16:12,233 --> 00:16:13,800
Take it easy, beautiful lady.

189
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,933
Do you know the owner of this building, Pretty?

190
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,300
You're good-looking,

191
00:16:19,533 --> 00:16:21,000
and nice-speaking.

192
00:16:24,533 --> 00:16:26,933
I'm the owner of this building.

193
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,800
You're the owner of Sarocha Publishing, aren't you?

194
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,433
Do you know this publishing house?

195
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,900
I'm not the owner of the publishing house.

196
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,200
The owner of the publishing house sold this building to me.

197
00:16:43,433 --> 00:16:45,466
The owner was around here.

198
00:16:45,466 --> 00:16:47,533
When the sale was finished, the owner moved to Bangkok.

199
00:16:48,433 --> 00:16:50,133
Do you know the owner's name?

200
00:16:50,133 --> 00:16:51,433
Where is the owner living now?

201
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,433
The owner's name is...

202
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,400
WITOON

203
00:17:01,366 --> 00:17:03,000
But I don't have his new phone number.

204
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,266
because he changed the number.

205
00:17:04,766 --> 00:17:06,266
He lives in Bangkok around...

206
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,766
New Petchaburi Road

207
00:17:10,433 --> 00:17:11,233
Soi

208
00:17:14,966 --> 00:17:15,766
40

209
00:17:18,033 --> 00:17:18,833
41

210
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,600
or 47

211
00:17:20,633 --> 00:17:21,533
or ...

212
00:17:21,533 --> 00:17:23,300
I'm not sure.

213
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:26,100
You may try to ask people around there.

214
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,733
There aren't many people named WITOON in the area.

215
00:17:31,366 --> 00:17:33,700
Thanks so much, Aunty.

216
00:17:33,966 --> 00:17:35,100
beautiful lady.

217
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,133
Yes? Excuse me.

218
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,266
This is a call from the hospital.

219
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:48,333
Your father is in the operating room.

220
00:17:59,566 --> 00:18:00,800
Don't worry.

221
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,133
Your dad will be okay.

222
00:18:02,566 --> 00:18:03,933
Thanks so much, P'KYO.

223
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,100
Your father has gastrointestinal bleeding.

224
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,000
He is in the operating room.

225
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,633
You said that you wouldn't come back to this house again.

226
00:18:39,633 --> 00:18:41,533
You've changed your mind.

227
00:18:42,266 --> 00:18:45,166
If it weren't for my mother's books, I probably wouldn't come back at all.

228
00:18:45,233 --> 00:18:46,433
You can take all of your mother's books if you want.

229
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,333
Because I won't read them.

230
00:18:50,733 --> 00:18:51,700
That's for sure.

231
00:18:52,366 --> 00:18:53,533
Probably because you don't read,

232
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,433
you turned out like this.

233
00:18:56,466 --> 00:18:57,633
Even if I don't read,

234
00:18:58,366 --> 00:19:01,600
I'm still smart enough not to choose the way you did.

235
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,566
I think it's good that your mother left you.

236
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:04,633
Because if mother were still around, ...

237
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,900
Mom died when you were born.

238
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,433
You've figured it out yourself.

239
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,466
She died...

240
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,266
because she was fleeing someone.

241
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,266
From now,

242
00:19:50,866 --> 00:19:52,500
I won't be back here again.

243
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:55,166
Someone like you,

244
00:19:55,966 --> 00:19:57,700
You'd rather live alone.

245
00:20:29,066 --> 00:20:29,866
Why do you make a face like that?

246
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:31,633
I'm not dead yet.

247
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:33,866
But you almost died, didn't you?

248
00:20:35,533 --> 00:20:37,566
It's just a slight stomach ache.

249
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,933
You think too much.

250
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:43,200
I told you

251
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,566
to stop drinking.

252
00:20:45,066 --> 00:20:46,533
But you wouldn't listen.

253
00:20:47,633 --> 00:20:49,200
You wouldn't listen to me either.

254
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,300
You've not believed what I said.

255
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,000
It's different.

256
00:20:54,766 --> 00:20:56,433
Are you worried about me?

257
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:00,266
Not that much.

258
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,566
But I just don't want anything to happen to you.

259
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:10,200
Did you know that since I walked up here

260
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,800
I kept thinking that

261
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,600
how would you be?

262
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,366
How was your facial expression?

263
00:21:17,766 --> 00:21:19,400
Would you like to see me?

264
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,433
Were you going to kick me out like you did at home?

265
00:21:28,266 --> 00:21:29,266
And why would you come back?

266
00:21:34,633 --> 00:21:35,433
Because I knew

267
00:21:37,266 --> 00:21:38,633
how important you are to me.

268
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,966
If something happens to you,

269
00:21:44,966 --> 00:21:47,033
I will never forgive myself.

270
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,700
Don't worry.

271
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,000
From now...

272
00:21:59,100 --> 00:21:59,900
I'll believe in you.

273
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:03,966
So you can figure it out...

274
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,800
when you almost die.

275
00:22:06,633 --> 00:22:07,533
It's the same for you.

276
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:09,800
You will come to see me

277
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,000
when you know I almost die.

278
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,100
You make me think of a friend.

279
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,466
I just found out that you have friends too.

280
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,000
We haven't been in contact for a long time.

281
00:22:27,566 --> 00:22:28,366
But about words...

282
00:22:29,966 --> 00:22:31,466
You are as good at being sarcastic as your mother.

283
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:35,766
If you still have friends,

284
00:22:36,066 --> 00:22:37,733
please contact them.

285
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:40,366
You'll not be lonely when you're home alone.

286
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,566
You won't go back home, will you?

287
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,000
I'd like to see your behavior first.

288
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,000
AKSORN...

289
00:22:59,466 --> 00:23:00,266
I am sorry.

290
00:23:04,866 --> 00:23:06,166
I'm not angry that you lied to me.

291
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,600
And I don't hate what you're studying.

292
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:12,966
But...

293
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,966
I really can't help but miss your mom.

294
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:31,900
Hi, Aunt SOOK.

295
00:23:32,633 --> 00:23:33,566
My father just finished surgery.

296
00:23:35,066 --> 00:23:37,400
In about two or three days, he should be able to go back home.

297
00:23:38,966 --> 00:23:39,766
Yes.

298
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,200
Yes. Thanks so much.

299
00:23:57,666 --> 00:23:58,466
Are you missing him, AKSORN?

300
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,200
[Sweet dream]

301
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:15,166
It's about two days, isn't it?

302
00:25:40,366 --> 00:25:40,566
[I miss you]

303
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,300
[I miss you]

304
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,800
You come back!

305
00:25:56,866 --> 00:25:57,666
Yes!

306
00:26:02,033 --> 00:26:02,833
What is it?

307
00:26:10,266 --> 00:26:11,233
I miss you too.

308
00:26:17,466 --> 00:26:19,900
Is there a meteor shower on your side today?

309
00:26:20,433 --> 00:26:21,233
Yes, there is.

310
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,600
Will you see it?

311
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,000
Sure!

312
00:26:25,866 --> 00:26:28,233
Please record a video for me.

313
00:26:28,233 --> 00:26:29,366
I want to see it.

314
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:32,633
Why do I have to record the video?

315
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,000
Let's watch it together.

316
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:08,800
Do you think that

317
00:27:09,466 --> 00:27:10,766
a meteor shower

318
00:27:10,766 --> 00:27:14,100
can bring us a miracle like we talked about?

319
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,033
I don't think so.

320
00:27:32,033 --> 00:27:32,833
Neither do I.

321
00:27:37,066 --> 00:27:38,500
By the way...

322
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,366
it's so good to be like this.

323
00:27:48,866 --> 00:27:50,200
it looks like we sit here together.

324
00:27:54,566 --> 00:27:55,366
AKSORN...

325
00:28:00,766 --> 00:28:01,566
I promise

326
00:28:02,433 --> 00:28:03,600
I will try my best to be there with you.

327
00:28:07,466 --> 00:28:09,066
Don't promise the impossible.

328
00:28:11,033 --> 00:28:12,000
Right now

329
00:28:12,033 --> 00:28:14,800
I just hoping you won't disappear along with the meteor shower,

330
00:28:15,033 --> 00:28:17,300
and aurora. That's why I'm so thankful.

331
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:22,233
I won't disappear.

332
00:28:25,566 --> 00:28:26,366
Promise me.

333
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,500
I promise.

334
00:29:25,866 --> 00:29:27,900
You're here, there, and everywhere!

335
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:29,133
It's just a coincidence.

336
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,466
You are NAPHA, right?

337
00:29:31,466 --> 00:29:34,466
You're the writer of "Memory in the Letter", aren't you?

338
00:29:35,566 --> 00:29:36,900
Are you coming back late today?

339
00:29:37,466 --> 00:29:38,433
Come here.

340
00:29:38,433 --> 00:29:39,800
What are you doing?

341
00:29:41,666 --> 00:29:42,766
If you miss me,

342
00:29:42,933 --> 00:29:44,166
just remember this kiss.

343
00:29:44,733 --> 00:29:46,566
I'm not sure...

344
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,900
what love is?

345
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,433
Do you want me to guide you about love?

346
00:29:50,933 --> 00:29:52,600
I'll come to see you.
