1
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:08,366
You're AKSORN, right?

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,566
I'm KYO.

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,666
Please be here with me.

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:13,900
What's wrong with you?

5
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:17,000
I think I'm being stalked.

6
00:00:24,266 --> 00:00:27,133
Um, the post you asked about
has received some responses.

7
00:00:27,266 --> 00:00:27,866
Really?

8
00:00:27,866 --> 00:00:28,900
Yes, let's check.

9
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:54,500
Why don't you ask me about what's happening?

10
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:01,133
If it's important to you, I'd be happy to help.

11
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:12,700
You're...

12
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:15,133
P'KYO.

13
00:01:15,566 --> 00:01:16,866
You can call me the usual way.

14
00:01:18,133 --> 00:01:23,066
The usual way, like when you were in the mirror
or when you stalked me?

15
00:01:23,866 --> 00:01:32,000
I didn't stalk you. I have to do everything
to ensure that history goes on as usual.

16
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,500
It's the Butterfly Effect.

17
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,733
That's right.

18
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:41,566
If something changes even a bit,

19
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,500
our story might not be the same.

20
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,900
You've been waiting since then.

21
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,200
Absolutely yes.

22
00:01:58,966 --> 00:02:04,666
I have to wait until the day
we meet again to this mirror.

23
00:02:05,966 --> 00:02:11,066
But I'm not used to
hearing older people call me P' (elder brother).

24
00:02:11,133 --> 00:02:12,933
But I like it.

25
00:02:15,733 --> 00:02:23,300
I've been waiting for the time when you call me like this,
and I can call you like that.

26
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:32,266
But you have to wait so long.

27
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,233
No matter how long,

28
00:02:38,733 --> 00:02:39,800
I can wait for you.

29
00:04:40,771 --> 00:04:43,790
=Memory in the letter=

30
00:05:04,066 --> 00:05:06,266
I've wanted to sit in a cafe
like this with you for a long time.

31
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,766
We've sat together before.

32
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:12,533
That's P'KYO, not SONGJAM.

33
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,266
Oh, it's the same for me.

34
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,666
By the way, is this the notebook
you said you'd give me?

35
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,600
Yes, it is.

36
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:29,200
Oh, you said you'd give it to me,
but you wrote everything in the entire book.

37
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,866
You're so late, though.

38
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:38,533
Well, consider the texts inside
as complementary.

39
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:49,466
Don't you like it?

40
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,500
How could I not like it?

41
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:53,800
All the texts

42
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,600
are about both of us, right?

43
00:06:00,733 --> 00:06:01,733
Did you write it all yourself?

44
00:06:01,966 --> 00:06:02,766
Yes, I did.

45
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,600
Your memory is so good.

46
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,966
I think my memory is not so good.

47
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,300
So I have to write everything down.

48
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,100
You know what,

49
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,133
every moment of the two of us,

50
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,600
there's no moment at all that I want to forget.

51
00:06:41,733 --> 00:06:46,600
So, you can remember that there are things
we want to do together, right?

52
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:15,200
What are you looking at?

53
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,700
Why don't you watch a movie?

54
00:07:16,966 --> 00:07:17,766
I'm watching...

55
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,300
So much fun!

56
00:07:19,566 --> 00:07:20,966
You keep looking at me.

57
00:07:23,266 --> 00:07:24,600
Eat this.

58
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,366
Eat more.

59
00:07:30,466 --> 00:07:31,800
Eat more and more.

60
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,933
No, you have to do it like this.

61
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,566
It smells good, right?

62
00:08:01,733 --> 00:08:03,333
I think so.

63
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,300
You smell good.

64
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:07,866
Pancake!

65
00:08:08,566 --> 00:08:10,333
Really?

66
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,166
Why do you keep looking at it?

67
00:08:27,866 --> 00:08:28,666
Please try.

68
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,033
What's wrong?

69
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:11,933
Why are you crying?

70
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,566
This pancake is so delicious.

71
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,300
Really?

72
00:09:24,966 --> 00:09:25,766
You know what...

73
00:09:27,966 --> 00:09:30,333
I've been waiting so long to taste this pancake.

74
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,466
It's so great!

75
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:52,733
Belated Merry Christmas.

76
00:09:58,066 --> 00:09:59,366
It's not a belated Christmas.

77
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,700
Because today is...

78
00:10:04,733 --> 00:10:06,466
our Christmas day.

79
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,200
So...

80
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,700
Merry Christmas to both of us!

81
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:54,866
So you're a doctor as you wish, right?

82
00:10:55,666 --> 00:11:01,966
Even though I've become a doctor in this world,
it's fine.

83
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,200
Is the doctor in this world
different from the one in your world?

84
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,566
It's a bit different.

85
00:11:08,566 --> 00:11:12,866
The doctor in my original world
didn't have such a heavy workload.

86
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,900
There was more time for rest,

87
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,466
and there was also more vacation time.

88
00:11:18,533 --> 00:11:20,566
This world is a bit different.

89
00:11:20,733 --> 00:11:24,266
But I don't want to go back.

90
00:11:25,466 --> 00:11:27,900
Why? If I were you, I would go back.

91
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,733
Why do I have to go back?

92
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:35,966
In that world...

93
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,766
there is no you.

94
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,866
Or will you go back with me?

95
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,966
How?

96
00:11:44,533 --> 00:11:45,966
Do you know how to go back to your world?

97
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,666
We probably have to
wait another ten thousand years or so.

98
00:11:50,933 --> 00:11:52,800
Oh, we'll be fossils by then.

99
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,366
Well, that's good.
We'll be together forever, then.

100
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,600
So, what about your dream?
What's the plan now?

101
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,166
To be a writer?

102
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,900
Won't you give up, right?

103
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,633
I won't give up.

104
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:13,233
The more I see what you wrote in the notebook,

105
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,900
the more I want to be a writer.

106
00:12:15,866 --> 00:12:17,600
The more I read,
the more I want to be a better writer.

107
00:12:17,966 --> 00:12:20,900
So, would you like some help?

108
00:12:21,933 --> 00:12:24,533
And how would you help?

109
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,700
Well...

110
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:37,233
Help you finish our story
from where we left off in the original.

111
00:12:50,766 --> 00:12:51,566
Here it is.

112
00:12:57,933 --> 00:12:59,600
You intend to tell me that...

113
00:13:00,466 --> 00:13:01,800
Tell you about what?

114
00:13:03,733 --> 00:13:06,266
What's going on here?

115
00:13:06,466 --> 00:13:08,366
Nothing happens.

116
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,400
Really?

117
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,266
Well...

118
00:13:10,266 --> 00:13:12,000
How about you, Mr. KYO?

119
00:13:12,766 --> 00:13:13,366
Yes!

120
00:13:18,566 --> 00:13:20,766
P'KYO, what are you going tell him?

121
00:13:21,566 --> 00:13:25,133
I'm going to tell the truth.

122
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,500
I've found an interesting book.

123
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,466
What's the book title?

124
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,800
Memory of Love.

125
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,733
It's my turn!

126
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,666
It's good. I like it.

127
00:14:01,866 --> 00:14:04,166
Where are we going?

128
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,766
I'm going to visit my friend.

129
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,700
Do you have a friend?

130
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Yes, I have.

131
00:14:11,966 --> 00:14:14,200
This person is my close friend.

132
00:14:31,533 --> 00:14:33,366
Are you going to tell me
that your close friend is...

133
00:14:33,966 --> 00:14:38,933
When I was here for the first time,
I stayed at your house.

134
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,200
Huh?

135
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,300
Our world is round.

136
00:14:43,366 --> 00:14:47,100
Even though the two of us are in different worlds,
we can still meet.

137
00:14:50,733 --> 00:14:52,400
Let's meet my close friend.

138
00:15:11,533 --> 00:15:12,333
Come in.

139
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,000
Hi, SONGJAM.

140
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,300
Next time, don't hurry up on me like this, dude.

141
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,000
I almost didn't clean up my home.

142
00:15:22,133 --> 00:15:22,933
Don't worry.

143
00:15:23,066 --> 00:15:24,666
I'm okay.

144
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,300
Hi, dad.

145
00:15:31,966 --> 00:15:33,100
How...

146
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:34,266
do you come here together?

147
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,033
I'm in a relationship with your son.

148
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,300
Wait...

149
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:43,366
What?

150
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,900
I am in a relationship with your son.

151
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:52,333
SONGJAM.

152
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,700
Clear things up with me right now.

153
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,900
Come with me!

154
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:55,900
Calm down, dad!

155
00:15:58,066 --> 00:15:58,866
SONGJAM!

156
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,000
Well...

157
00:16:10,466 --> 00:16:12,800
What did you say to my dad to accept you?

158
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,500
I reasonably talked with him.

159
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,200
He is a person who talks rationally.

160
00:16:19,366 --> 00:16:21,066
Are you sure?

161
00:16:21,866 --> 00:16:24,700
No father who wouldn't want his son
to find good love, right?

162
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,200
Even if it's a bit shocking.

163
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,800
Hmm...

164
00:16:29,966 --> 00:16:34,000
So how can you be sure that it's good love?

165
00:16:35,933 --> 00:16:39,000
You have to prove it yourself.

166
00:16:42,566 --> 00:16:43,466
Let's wait and see.

167
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,666
I think you have to wait
and see from today onwards.

168
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,566
What are you doing?

169
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,066
Tomorrow I have to go to work early.

170
00:16:52,566 --> 00:16:53,700
Please let me stay here tonight.

171
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,100
What? You still have time to go back.

172
00:16:57,566 --> 00:16:59,300
I'm so sleepy.

173
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,133
Have you asked for the room owner's permission?

174
00:17:02,133 --> 00:17:05,633
I used to be the room owner.

175
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,666
But now you're not.

176
00:17:08,066 --> 00:17:10,966
I'm here to help you write the novel.

177
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,766
I don't think so. Please go back.

178
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:16,766
Can't I stay in your room, can I?

179
00:17:16,933 --> 00:17:18,966
You can't. Please go back.

180
00:17:19,133 --> 00:17:20,700
Please let me stay.

181
00:17:21,133 --> 00:17:23,766
No!

182
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:25,766
Please...

183
00:17:26,766 --> 00:17:28,066
Just a night.

184
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,266
No way!

185
00:17:30,366 --> 00:17:31,700
Please...

186
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,066
Do you love me?

187
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,033
It's so good.

188
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,266
You're so stubborn.

189
00:18:13,533 --> 00:18:15,033
P'AKSORN...

190
00:18:15,266 --> 00:18:18,266
Please lay down here with me.

191
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:21,933
I have a question.

192
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,533
Why do you have a pillow?

193
00:18:23,866 --> 00:18:27,233
Act like you're in a drama.
The bed was large with a single pillow.

194
00:18:27,466 --> 00:18:29,366
I'm single and

195
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:30,566
available.

196
00:18:32,966 --> 00:18:34,066
From now on,

197
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,933
you must have two pillows.

198
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,566
How about writing the novel?

199
00:18:45,733 --> 00:18:47,300
What's your idea?

200
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,666
I think...

201
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,000
our story from now on.

202
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,766
It's going to be a romantic story.

203
00:19:00,266 --> 00:19:01,766
Sure.

204
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:06,166
Just think about it. Two people living
in different worlds and the end,

205
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:09,333
finding a way to meet each other,

206
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:12,333
it's quite romantic.

207
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,566
I think it can be even more romantic than this.

208
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:19,166
How?

209
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,800
Do you want to know?

210
00:19:30,266 --> 00:19:31,933
It's not difficult.

211
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,566
This technique is

212
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,000
quite simple.

213
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,666
But you have to trust me.

214
00:19:58,733 --> 00:20:00,200
This original,

215
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,333
I will help you to complete the rest.

216
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:26,766
Hello, sir.

217
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,300
Hello, guys.

218
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,366
What kind of song do you want today, Mr. KYO?

219
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:37,800
Love? Loneliness?
There's none of it left for you.

220
00:20:38,466 --> 00:20:39,733
I didn't come to buy today, sir.

221
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,233
Oh, then why are you here?

222
00:20:46,533 --> 00:20:47,333
Here it is.

223
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,200
Why do you give it to me?

224
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,900
If it's not because of you,
there is no book out now.

225
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,366
You're the only one
who gave me NAPHA's address.

226
00:21:08,366 --> 00:21:13,733
I got the original and finished the rest.

227
00:21:16,266 --> 00:21:17,733
Romantic novel?

228
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:18,900
Yes, sir.

229
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:26,233
So you found out
who was in your heart.

230
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,033
Keep that person safe.

231
00:21:34,866 --> 00:21:36,000
Thank you, sir.

232
00:21:52,066 --> 00:21:54,166
This book is for you.

233
00:21:58,966 --> 00:22:00,233
Why do you give it to me?

234
00:22:00,566 --> 00:22:02,100
I don't want it.

235
00:22:09,851 --> 00:22:10,851
Brother.

236
00:22:26,966 --> 00:22:29,000
I have read it all.

237
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,366
The author's writing is so good.

238
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,066
This story is so good.

239
00:22:36,066 --> 00:22:37,800
You have good taste.

240
00:22:38,133 --> 00:22:41,266
Sure. Today I'm so lucky to meet the writer.

241
00:22:42,133 --> 00:22:43,866
Can the writer sign the book for me?

242
00:22:44,966 --> 00:22:45,866
Sure.

243
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,500
This is my first signature for the book.

244
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:04,533
Thanks for not listening to my words.

245
00:23:08,466 --> 00:23:09,300
Congratulations, son!

246
00:23:13,933 --> 00:23:14,766
What's happened?

247
00:23:18,266 --> 00:23:19,566
Please tell me, son.

248
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:22,533
I'm so happy.

249
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,200
It's alright, my son.

250
00:23:26,366 --> 00:23:27,266
Congrats.

251
00:23:29,266 --> 00:23:30,566
I'm so happy for you.

252
00:23:49,866 --> 00:23:51,066
Can I take a photo with you?

253
00:23:51,066 --> 00:23:51,866
Yes.

254
00:24:01,966 --> 00:24:03,933
I like your writing style.

255
00:24:03,933 --> 00:24:04,733
Thanks so much.

256
00:24:11,766 --> 00:24:12,733
Thank you.

257
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,100
Can you sign for me?

258
00:24:49,133 --> 00:24:49,933
Yes.

259
00:24:51,766 --> 00:24:53,533
What's your name?

260
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,933
I'm PEACH.

261
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,200
Have we met before?

262
00:25:03,966 --> 00:25:09,800
I'm so sorry, P'AKSORN.
I'm the one who followed you.

263
00:25:14,533 --> 00:25:15,700
Oh! It's you.

264
00:25:16,133 --> 00:25:19,400
I found this novel on the website.

265
00:25:20,266 --> 00:25:21,166
May I have your name?

266
00:25:21,533 --> 00:25:22,700
I'm AKSORN.

267
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,466
It's 100 Thai baht.

268
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,866
I knew that...

269
00:25:30,966 --> 00:25:32,966
A senior student's name is AKSORN.

270
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,166
Their characteristics are similar.

271
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,200
I think they're the same person.

272
00:25:38,666 --> 00:25:40,733
Finally, you're the writer.

273
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,166
I'm almost ready to tell the police.
Do you know?

274
00:25:43,966 --> 00:25:45,466
Don't do like this again.

275
00:25:45,666 --> 00:25:46,533
I promise.

276
00:25:48,733 --> 00:25:49,666
P'AKSORN...

277
00:25:49,766 --> 00:25:51,466
Can I ask a question?

278
00:25:52,933 --> 00:25:53,733
Yes?

279
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,800
If AKSORN exists, how about SONGJAM?

280
00:25:58,933 --> 00:25:59,733
SONGJAM?

281
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:06,933
Here is SONGJAM.

282
00:26:09,266 --> 00:26:11,466
Is he P'KYO, isn't he?

283
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,866
He came to our world, didn't he?

284
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,100
Here it is.

285
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,400
Thanks so much.

286
00:26:45,366 --> 00:26:46,600
Today, you're so great.

287
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,133
I'm so tired.

288
00:26:51,966 --> 00:26:54,566
Your dream came true.

289
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,300
It's not easy.

290
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:03,533
But I'm so happy.

291
00:27:10,366 --> 00:27:12,266
So you've achieved your goal.

292
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,400
I've not.

293
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,466
If a writer can create a bestseller
in just one book and finish it,

294
00:27:19,733 --> 00:27:22,633
it's rare to have books to read these days.

295
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,766
But it's considered an important first step, isn't it?

296
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,966
I have to thank you for that, SONGJAM.

297
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,566
If I didn't have you,
there wouldn't be anything like this.

298
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,833
Do you want me to keep it?

299
00:27:54,166 --> 00:28:00,266
It's my book. I want you to read it.

300
00:28:00,266 --> 00:28:03,266
I know you've not read it yet.

301
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,766
You know me well.

302
00:28:16,966 --> 00:28:18,333
Why don't you read it?

303
00:28:22,766 --> 00:28:28,500
I don't want it to end.

304
00:28:31,866 --> 00:28:35,800
Don't worry.

305
00:28:38,166 --> 00:28:38,966
Why?

306
00:28:40,266 --> 00:28:45,100
Because our story has no end.
