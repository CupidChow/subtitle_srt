[Today at 13:00, moving out]

2
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:01,733
You don't understand. I want to study literature.

3
00:01:01,733 --> 00:01:02,933
I want to study like Mom.

4
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,166
If you still don't stop pursuing that crazy dream...

5
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:09,833
You can leave this house right now.

6
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:11,866
Don't worry. I'm leaving.

7
00:01:11,966 --> 00:01:13,866
If I have to endure living with someone like you,

8
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:15,400
I'd rather live alone.

9
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,200
Does someone like me?

10
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,800
The one that you lie to for all of your life, huh?

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,066
If you understood me from the beginning,

12
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,233
I wouldn't have to lie.

13
00:01:26,533 --> 00:01:27,333
I truly understand you,

14
00:01:28,633 --> 00:01:29,533
that's why I don't want you to choose that dream.

15
00:01:31,066 --> 00:01:32,100
Are you sure that the way you choose

16
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,833
will make your life better?

17
00:01:37,033 --> 00:01:39,200
It's my choice.

18
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,800
It's none of your business.

19
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,100
Then just leave.

20
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,033
Take out all this garbage with you!

21
00:01:47,033 --> 00:01:47,833
Get out!

22
00:02:06,966 --> 00:02:07,933
From now on,

23
00:02:08,533 --> 00:02:10,166
I won't be back here again.

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,833
The person like you

25
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,366
should live alone all by yourself!

26
00:02:53,566 --> 00:02:55,266
Are you AKSORN, the one I spoke to on the phone?

27
00:02:55,266 --> 00:02:56,066
Yes, I am.

28
00:02:56,566 --> 00:02:57,633
You're so lucky.

29
00:02:57,633 --> 00:02:59,466
The top-floor room has just become available.

30
00:02:59,966 --> 00:03:01,466
I'll take you up there to see it.

31
00:03:06,866 --> 00:03:08,666
A dormitory doesn't have an elevator like this,

32
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:11,033
no one wants to stay on the upper floors.

33
00:03:16,966 --> 00:03:18,400
Wanna change your mind?

34
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,466
The rooms downstairs are still available.

35
00:03:20,566 --> 00:03:22,400
It's okay. This floor is fine for me.

36
00:03:22,433 --> 00:03:23,666
You like exercise, don't you?

37
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,333
You're quite different from others.

38
00:03:25,566 --> 00:03:26,833
I don't think so.

39
00:03:26,966 --> 00:03:28,500
Living on a high floor like this,

40
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,933
you get to see beautiful views.

41
00:03:30,766 --> 00:03:32,266
Do you agree with me?

42
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,766
If you need help, please call me anytime.

43
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,300
Thank you so much.

44
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,100
You're welcome.

45
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,466
By the way, the previous room owner left a mirror for you to use.

46
00:03:41,733 --> 00:03:43,000
If you don't like it, just let me know.

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,366
My staff will take it away for you.

48
00:03:44,566 --> 00:03:45,366
Thanks.

49
00:03:45,933 --> 00:03:46,733
See you.

This can be considered good news for stargazers.

52
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:30,466
During this month, there will be a meteor shower phenomenon

53
00:06:30,466 --> 00:06:32,133
which will occur twice in a row.

54
00:06:32,633 --> 00:06:35,133
And today marks the first occurrence in history

55
00:06:35,533 --> 00:06:36,900

56
00:06:36,966 --> 00:06:39,133

00:10:54,933 --> 00:10:58,500
is experiencing an aurora phenomenon, or what we commonly call

59
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,200
the Northern Lights.

60
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,966
It's currently capturing the attention of scientists worldwide.

61
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,600
It's speculated to be a result of abnormal atmospheric conditions,

62
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:09,600
and might be related to the meteor shower phenomenon.

63
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,300
Isn’t that a dream?

64
00:12:05,466 --> 00:12:07,066

67
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:19,100
You’re human, right?
Yes, I am.

68
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,600
How do you get inside a mirror?
No, I'm not inside a mirror.

69
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,700
But it's you! How do you get inside a mirror?

70
00:12:38,233 --> 00:12:39,066
Well, it's just like a real mirror.

71
00:13:02,266 --> 00:13:03,066
Hey!

72
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:04,733
Stop touching it!

73
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,333
Is this for real?

00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,500

You're dressed like me.

76
00:13:22,233 --> 00:13:24,033
What year is it there, in the year B.E. (Buddhist Era)?

77
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:25,900
B.E. year?

78
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:29,300
Do you mean the G.E. (God Era) year?

79
00:13:30,233 --> 00:13:31,700
Here, it's only the God Era year.

80
00:13:32,033 --> 00:13:33,900
Right now, it's the God Era year 165.

81
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,333
Then, then what year is it there?

82
00:13:39,933 --> 00:13:43,233
Here, it is the Buddhist Era year 2565

83
00:13:43,233 --> 00:13:45,800
abbreviated as B.E. 2565.

84
00:13:48,933 --> 00:13:51,000
The Buddhist Era year?

85
00:13:57,866 --> 00:13:59,833
Oh! I have the examination.

86
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000

[Parallel Universes]

[What are Parallel Universes? Are they real?]

94
00:14:49,866 --> 00:14:54,366
The parallel universe is a hypothesis suggesting an infinite number of diverse universes.

95
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:07,900
The Big Bang, occurring about 14 billion years ago, not only led to the birth of our universe but also gave rise to the concept of the multiverse.

96
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:17,733
This expansive event spawned multiple universes beyond our own, often referred to as the parallel universe or multiverse.

97
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:23,033
The Quantum parallel universe refers to a dimension with a mathematical implication.

109
00:16:05,366 --> 00:16:06,233

110
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:08,333
Have you remembered yet?

111
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,733
Oh, I see.

112
00:16:09,866 --> 00:16:11,500
I thought you looked familiar.

113
00:16:11,633 --> 00:16:13,600
You're a regular customer at the bookstore.

114
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,833
Even though I'm a regular customer you hardly remember me.

115
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,766
I'm so sorry, please forgive me.

116
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,033
Earlier, I heard you mention about quantum, are you interested in physics?

117
00:16:29,233 --> 00:16:30,600
Yes, but a bit.

118
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,533
But the more I read, the less I understand.

119
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:42,433
The basics of quantum physics are about the unpredictability and uncertainty of particles.

120
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,866
What is it, exactly?

121
00:16:46,933 --> 00:16:47,733
Put simply,

122
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,633
It's like us accidentally meeting at the coffee shop earlier.

123
00:16:51,866 --> 00:16:52,666
Nothing is certain.

124
00:16:53,466 --> 00:16:55,266
And nothing is confirming that we'll meet again.

125
00:16:58,466 --> 00:17:00,300
Sounds pretty challenging to grasp.

126
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,800
For me,

127
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,800
Quantum physics is similar to love,

Do they exist?

Even if it's yet to be proven.

135
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,733
But from recent scientific evidence,

136
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:40,533
it somewhat points out that

137
00:17:41,566 --> 00:17:42,966
It might exist.

138
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,133

139
00:17:45,866 --> 00:17:47,100

00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:50,100
You didn't visit the bookstore today?

142
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,033
I'm afraid not. I plan to go buy some vinyl records from a nearby shop.

143
00:17:53,766 --> 00:17:54,866

151
00:18:58,933 --> 00:19:00,600
Sure, let's say you're the older one.

00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,900
Is that okay like this?

153
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,533
Then why wouldn't it be?

154
00:19:04,533 --> 00:19:05,666
Okay okay...

00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,300
Did you buy these for me?

160
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,966
How am I supposed to eat them?

161
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,833
Uh, I forgot.

162
00:19:33,433 --> 00:19:34,900
Ah, I have an idea.

163
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,266
Watch me eat then

164
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,666
Is it delicious?
Super delicious!

165
00:19:52,633 --> 00:19:54,333
What if I suddenly get hungry?

166
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,666
How will you take responsibility for that?

167
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:02,533
Well...

168
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:05,633
Tell me how will I take responsibility for that?

169
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,000
Any idea?

170
00:20:09,466 --> 00:20:10,266
Tell me...

171
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,300
I won't talk to you anymore.

Yes.

177
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,833
But how will you listen to music with me?

178
00:20:35,533 --> 00:20:37,633
I think you can't.

179
00:20:37,933 --> 00:20:41,133
Then, just watch me listen to music.

180
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,933
Ah, I'm just kidding, just kidding.

181
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,066
Let me turn on the speaker for you to listen to.

00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:19,800
I love listening to music. By the way, what do you usually do in your free time?

186
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,300
I also like listening to music.

187
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,366
And...

188
00:21:25,633 --> 00:21:26,533
reading novels.

189
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,066
Reading novels?

190
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,133
Sometimes, I watch movies.

191
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:33,766
Me too.

192
00:21:35,033 --> 00:21:39,566
I think, our worlds have something in common, right?

193
00:21:50,233 --> 00:21:51,033
SONGJAM...

194
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,933
You exist, don't you?

195
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,433
Huh? What a question!

196
00:22:01,433 --> 00:22:03,533
Nothing, there's nothing.

197
00:22:04,133 --> 00:22:05,166
I'm going to watch a movie.

198
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,966
Oh, you're going to watch a movie, aren't you?

199
00:22:08,066 --> 00:22:09,166
Let me watch a movie, please.

200
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:11,033
Sure, let's watch together.

201
00:22:11,766 --> 00:22:12,366
Hey...

202
00:22:12,366 --> 00:22:14,766
If you're sitting there, how can I watch a movie with you?

203
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,566
Sorry, I forgot.

204
00:22:20,533 --> 00:22:21,533
Let's sit and watch right here.

205
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:33,533
You look like a kid at a gaming store.

206
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:36,266
What?

207
00:22:36,266 --> 00:22:38,266
A kid at a gaming store?

208
00:22:39,366 --> 00:22:40,933
Nothing much.

209
00:22:41,066 --> 00:22:42,333
Please forget it.

210
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,900
[Hi, dad.]

211
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,133
[Hi, son.]

212
00:23:06,066 --> 00:23:06,866
[Dad...]

213
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,300
Let's watch a movie.

214
00:24:23,533 --> 00:24:24,400
Are you sneakily watching me again?

215
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,500
No, I'm not sneaking.

216
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,133
I'm not deliberately doing it.

217
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,666
Next time, cover the mirror with a cloth.

218
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,833
Usually, you're the one who does it.

219
00:24:35,633 --> 00:24:38,100
But if I forget, you should do it.

220
00:24:46,933 --> 00:24:48,000
But I think...

221
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,566
uncovering the mirror with a cloth is another good choice...

222
00:24:51,933 --> 00:24:52,800
You are a pervert!

223
00:24:53,233 --> 00:24:55,733
Me? What's on your mind?

224
00:24:57,433 --> 00:25:00,133
It's not like I'm thinking like you do.

225
00:25:03,466 --> 00:25:05,300
I'm late now. I have to go.

226
00:25:06,433 --> 00:25:07,400
Really?

227
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,133
But you don't have a hand watch.

228
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,333
Keep love in your heart.

229
00:25:21,433 --> 00:25:22,233
A life without love,

230
00:25:23,266 --> 00:25:24,533
is like a garden without the sun.

231
00:25:27,666 --> 00:25:28,466
SONGJAM...

232
00:25:30,266 --> 00:25:32,666
You exist, don't you?

233
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,066
When the withered flower wilts and dies...

234
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,866
What do you think of this quote by Oscar Wilde?

235
00:25:40,066 --> 00:25:40,866
Mr.AKSORN...

236
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,400
Mr.AKSORN!

237
00:25:45,733 --> 00:25:46,600
Yes, sir?

238
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,500
Keep love in your heart.

239
00:25:49,866 --> 00:25:51,066
A life without love,

240
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,700
is like a garden without the sun.

241
00:25:55,033 --> 00:25:56,866
When the withered flower wilts and dies...

242
00:25:58,133 --> 00:25:59,600
What do you think of this quote?

243
00:26:05,133 --> 00:26:06,800
If you still don't stop pursuing that crazy dream...

244
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,933
You can leave this house right now.

245
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,200
A life without love?

246
00:26:15,666 --> 00:26:16,466
Then just leave.

247
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,500
Take out all this garbage with you!

248
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,300
Get out!

249
00:26:25,266 --> 00:26:27,933
If I have to live in a garden without the sun

250
00:26:27,933 --> 00:26:29,733
and the withered flower wilts and dies,

251
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,433
I guess no one wants to come and give love to me and my garden, right?

252
00:26:37,466 --> 00:26:38,266
That's the reason why

253
00:26:39,466 --> 00:26:40,266
we need to find love.

254
00:26:45,233 --> 00:26:46,533
Do you think love that needs to be pursued...

255
00:26:47,633 --> 00:26:49,400
it be called love?

256
00:27:58,333 --> 00:28:00,000
You said that you wouldn't come back to this house again.

257
00:28:01,633 --> 00:28:02,733
But...

258
00:28:02,733 --> 00:28:03,800
You've changed your mind.

259
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,833
If it weren't for my mother's books,

260
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,433
I probably wouldn't come back at all.

261
00:28:08,033 --> 00:28:09,466
You can take all of your mother's books if you want.

262
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,533
Because I won't read them.

263
00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:14,500
That's for sure.

264
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,400
Probably because you don't read,

265
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,300
you turned out like this.

266
00:28:19,433 --> 00:28:20,500
Even if I don't read,

267
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:24,466
I'm still smart enough not to choose the way you did.

268
00:28:24,466 --> 00:28:25,700
So, how did you choose?

269
00:28:27,033 --> 00:28:29,566
You chose the way that you never tried to understand others, right?

270
00:28:30,566 --> 00:28:32,733
I think it's good that your mother left you.

271
00:28:32,833 --> 00:28:34,366
Because if mother were still around, ...

272
00:28:36,666 --> 00:28:37,666
Mom died when you were born.

273
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,200
You've figured it out yourself.

274
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,400
She died...

275
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,400
because she was fleeing someone.

276
00:29:29,466 --> 00:29:31,700
I want to hand you a face towel.

277
00:29:37,133 --> 00:29:38,700
Even though we're in different worlds,

278
00:29:40,933 --> 00:29:42,400
I'll always be by your side.

279
00:29:59,066 --> 00:29:59,866
Thank you, SONGJAM.

280
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,400
Thank you for being by my side.

281
00:30:10,733 --> 00:30:11,733
I'm here for you.

282
00:30:19,533 --> 00:30:20,900
So, you have to prove it to him.

283
00:30:22,233 --> 00:30:23,033
That you can do it.

284
00:30:25,933 --> 00:30:27,266
Even though I'm not sure yet

285
00:30:28,666 --> 00:30:29,466
whether I'll succeed?

286
00:30:32,533 --> 00:30:34,533
I don't know what the end will be like.

287
00:30:36,533 --> 00:30:38,866
But right now, you have to start.

288
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,733
Just lie to him that I'm studying engineering,

289
00:30:43,733 --> 00:30:44,900
and then run away to study literature.

290
00:30:45,233 --> 00:30:46,633
Hasn't it started yet?

291
00:30:50,066 --> 00:30:50,866
Have you started writing, then?

292
00:30:57,433 --> 00:30:59,700
Not yet.
Can't you see?

293
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,833
You want to be a writer.

294
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:03,900
You have to start with writing, don't you?

295
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:10,500
If you become a real writer,

296
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,433
I'll be the first one to buy your book.

297
00:31:18,033 --> 00:31:18,833
It may be expensive.

298
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,400
Can I reserve one?

299
00:31:26,533 --> 00:31:27,333
Oh!

300
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,800
Gold coin!

301
00:31:29,266 --> 00:31:30,333
Your family is rich, isn't it?

302
00:31:31,433 --> 00:31:32,233
Rich, huh?

303
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,033
In my world,

304
00:31:35,266 --> 00:31:37,533
we use coins like these as currency.

305
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,833
And...

306
00:31:39,866 --> 00:31:42,433
can I eat this?
Are you crazy?

307
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,033
This is a coin!

308
00:31:44,366 --> 00:31:46,633
Just forget about it.

309
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,300
How about helping me choose vinyl records now?

310
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,000
Here they are.

311
00:32:00,233 --> 00:32:01,033
Left or right?

312
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,100
I think...

313
00:32:07,233 --> 00:32:08,666
I prefer this one.

314
00:32:08,666 --> 00:32:10,000
This one?

315
00:32:10,433 --> 00:32:11,600
Are you sure?

316
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,566
Why?

317
00:32:13,566 --> 00:32:15,500
This vinyl record...

318
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,433
is about dancing music.

319
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,633
So, you have to dance with me.

320
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:26,733
But I don't know how to dance.

321
00:32:26,733 --> 00:32:27,833
Don't worry.

322
00:32:27,833 --> 00:32:29,433
I'll guide you.

323
00:32:43,133 --> 00:32:46,833
Let's move to the right.

324
00:32:51,333 --> 00:32:54,333
Then move to the left...

325
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:55,966
I think I'm being stalked.

326
00:34:55,966 --> 00:34:57,733
Hey, did you figure it out yourself?

327
00:34:57,866 --> 00:34:59,033
What were you looking for?

328
00:34:59,033 --> 00:35:00,666
I was looking for a CCTV camera.

329
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:02,066
If I were to say...

330
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:05,066
someone took our story and wrote it as an online novel,

331
00:35:05,066 --> 00:35:06,500
Seriously?

332
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,700
How could anyone know about us?

333
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,700
An atom has no feeling.

334
00:35:11,966 --> 00:35:13,166
So, hurry back today.

335
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:15,600
I'll wait for you to watch a movie.

336
00:35:15,666 --> 00:35:16,900
Don't rush to finish it.

337
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,033
I won't promise.

338
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:21,033
You won't promise?
