1
00:00:07,533 --> 00:00:08,866
Are you sure?

2
00:00:08,933 --> 00:00:10,800
I have been used to driving
around this area for many years.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,066
It seems like the only person
around here is named WITOON.

4
00:00:15,133 --> 00:00:16,300
Thanks so much.

5
00:01:58,855 --> 00:02:02,013
=Memory in the Letter=

6
00:02:09,433 --> 00:02:10,400
Hi, boy!

7
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,300
Sawasdee krub, Uncle.

8
00:02:14,433 --> 00:02:16,900
Are you WITOON,

9
00:02:17,033 --> 00:02:19,100
the owner of Sarocha Publishing House?

10
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:23,466
Yes.

11
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,833
I'm the owner.

12
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,600
What are you doing here?

13
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,200
I'm looking for the owner of this email.

14
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,633
That's my email.

15
00:02:52,066 --> 00:02:53,833
So...

16
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:54,766
Actually...

17
00:02:54,766 --> 00:03:00,433
It's SAROCHA's email.

18
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,400
SAROCHA?

19
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:08,666
If SAROCHA is the owner of this email,

20
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:09,966
where is she now?

21
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,300
She is here.

22
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:23,166
She passed away.

23
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,300
Only love is left.

24
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,466
It's such a good memory for me...

25
00:03:29,466 --> 00:03:30,633
right here.

26
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,700
That's why...

27
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,500
I can't resist running the publishing house
under her name any longer.

28
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:45,566
How about you?

29
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,700
Is there anyone hidden in your heart yet?

30
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,700
Hmm...

31
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:57,966
Yes, there is.

32
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,333
If that one is still alive,

33
00:04:01,466 --> 00:04:03,300
please hold hands tightly.

34
00:04:06,066 --> 00:04:06,866
Okay.

35
00:04:22,466 --> 00:04:23,400
This is...

36
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,533
another editor

37
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:27,266
who uses this email account.

38
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:29,966
I've not contacted her

39
00:04:29,966 --> 00:04:30,966
for many years.

40
00:04:33,266 --> 00:04:33,900
You may try to

41
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,833
look for her at this address.

42
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:46,566
Thanks so much.

43
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,200
Good luck.

44
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,200
SONGJAM.

45
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,500
You smile like this.

46
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,200
I guess you have good news, right?

47
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,266
I have the address.

48
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,366
You mean the writer's address, don't you?

49
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:23,500
Yes.

50
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:28,233
But I'm not sure if I go to the writer's address,
I will meet her.

51
00:05:29,266 --> 00:05:31,200
But I think she's waiting for you.

52
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,566
Why do you think like that?

53
00:05:34,566 --> 00:05:36,600
Because if she knows our story well,

54
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,233
she will know what will happen next, like

55
00:05:39,233 --> 00:05:40,533
she may know that you're going to meet her.

56
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:42,966
Oh!

57
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,400
I'm so scared

58
00:05:45,566 --> 00:05:48,566
like I'm going to the witch's house.

59
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,300
Like in the horror novel.

60
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:54,533
And our story is like a novel enough.

61
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,533
When will you see her?

62
00:06:00,266 --> 00:06:01,333
Tomorrow...

63
00:06:03,133 --> 00:06:05,000
But...

64
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,233
tomorrow I'm not available. I'm busy.

65
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,600
I know!

66
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:18,466
How about you?

67
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,800
Is there anyone hidden in your heart yet?

68
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,200
If that one is still alive,

69
00:06:26,366 --> 00:06:28,166
please hold hands tightly.

70
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,766
SONGJAM, can I hold your hand, please?

71
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,700
Sure!

72
00:06:54,566 --> 00:06:56,833
Thanks for being part of my life.

73
00:06:58,666 --> 00:06:59,600
I want to...

74
00:07:01,066 --> 00:07:02,566
thank you

75
00:07:02,566 --> 00:07:04,400
for being part of my life too.

76
00:07:19,033 --> 00:07:20,400
520 baht.

77
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,200
Thank you so much.

78
00:07:24,366 --> 00:07:25,200
P'NAY.

79
00:07:25,866 --> 00:07:27,366
May I finish work a bit early today?

80
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:29,233
Are you looking for the writer again?

81
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,966
But I can't lend you a car.

82
00:07:31,966 --> 00:07:33,166
Because my car is being repaired.

83
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,200
I will use a rental car.

84
00:07:35,933 --> 00:07:37,766
Why don't you ask P'KYO for help?

85
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,800
I'm afraid not.

86
00:07:39,933 --> 00:07:41,166
I don't want to bother him.

87
00:07:41,266 --> 00:07:42,066
I'll go myself.

88
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,766
Actually, I can be your driver.

89
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:49,633
How much?

90
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,300
300 baht.

91
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,733
You're here, there, and everywhere!

92
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,800
It's just a coincidence.

93
00:08:13,966 --> 00:08:15,633
This time, you can't refer to

94
00:08:15,633 --> 00:08:16,933
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle again.

95
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,966
You did a good study.

96
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,466
Yes, I did.

97
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,766
Then I have to thank to every coincidence
in this world

98
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,300
to let me be your driver.

99
00:08:59,066 --> 00:08:59,866
Is this the writer's house?

100
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,600
I think so.

101
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:04,900
Let's try pressing the bell.

102
00:09:11,266 --> 00:09:12,066
Sawasdee krub.

103
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,466
Are you NAPHA, right?

104
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,066
You're the writer of

105
00:09:20,066 --> 00:09:22,233
"Memory in the Letter", aren't you?

106
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,500
Yes, I am.

107
00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:29,600
Please let me discuss with you.

108
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:35,400
AKSORN?

109
00:09:36,966 --> 00:09:40,500
You mean "AKSORN" in the novel, don't you??

110
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,466
Yes.

111
00:09:41,566 --> 00:09:43,700
I'm AKSORN.

112
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,766
How is that possible?

113
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,866
I should ask you that question.

114
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,800
How do you know our story?

115
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,066
You're going to say

116
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,066
the novel that I upload to the website

117
00:09:55,366 --> 00:09:57,066
is real, isn't it?

118
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,200
Yes!

119
00:10:03,433 --> 00:10:04,366
I don't believe you.

120
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,500
It's impossible.

121
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:13,766
The next episode that hasn't been uploaded is about me and SONGJAM
are going to watch the meteor shower together at the rooftop.

122
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,533
Let me tell you something.

123
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,866
The readers can guess what will happen next.

124
00:10:27,733 --> 00:10:32,933
SONGJAM and I are going to watch the meteor shower
together at the rooftop. And then I ask SONGJAM

125
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,966
"Do you think that a meteor shower

126
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,533
can bring us a miracle

127
00:10:37,533 --> 00:10:39,400
like we talked about?"

128
00:10:40,566 --> 00:10:41,433
SOMJAM replied...

129
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,400
I don't think so.

130
00:10:52,366 --> 00:10:53,166
I promise

131
00:10:54,033 --> 00:10:55,233
I will try my best to be there with you.

132
00:10:59,066 --> 00:11:00,666
Don't promise the impossible.

133
00:11:03,033 --> 00:11:03,833
How can it be?

134
00:11:07,966 --> 00:11:09,866
So you're going to say that SOMJAM.

135
00:11:09,866 --> 00:11:10,766
Yes.

136
00:11:10,766 --> 00:11:12,566
SONGJAM exists.

137
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,700
Have you never heard about this stuff before?

138
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,166
How can you possibly write this novel?

139
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,100
I'm not the writer of this novel.

140
00:11:57,766 --> 00:12:00,500
Last month when I cleaned my house,

141
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:05,100
I found this original one from the time
when I used to work at the publishing house.

142
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:07,166
I decided to sit down and give it a read.

143
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:10,266
I remembered this one—it was so much fun!

144
00:12:10,766 --> 00:12:12,533
Almost got it ready for printing.

145
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
But the thing is, back then,
I couldn't get in touch with the author.

146
00:12:18,033 --> 00:12:19,900
I still keep reading this novel again and again.

147
00:12:19,966 --> 00:12:21,833
I feel that this is an opportunity

148
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,800
to let other people to read this novel.

149
00:12:24,566 --> 00:12:27,100
So I decided to upload this novel on the website.

150
00:12:36,133 --> 00:12:36,933
LIKIT?

151
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,366
LIKIT is a pen name of this novel's writer.

152
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:46,900
Maybe...

153
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:48,833
My mother...

154
00:12:49,466 --> 00:12:50,433
Your mother?

155
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,166
I'm not so sure.

156
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:55,366
Because

157
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,366
my father doesn't often tell stories about my mother.

158
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:02,700
I hope it's not.

159
00:13:05,266 --> 00:13:06,066
Because if it's true

160
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,033
it's quite complicated.

161
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:12,933
Wait a minute...

162
00:13:13,033 --> 00:13:16,766
SONGJAM is waiting for you
at your room now, isn't it?

163
00:13:17,533 --> 00:13:19,800
I have to go back now.

164
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:20,966
Please wait.

165
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:22,300
You don't need to go back now.

166
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,233
But it's very late at night.

167
00:13:25,233 --> 00:13:25,833
Please don't go back.

168
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,200
You don't need to be hurry.

169
00:13:30,066 --> 00:13:31,400
I mean...

170
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:36,700
It's really late as you said,
and driving back now would be dangerous.

171
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,800
How about SONGJAM?

172
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,200
You already told him
before you came here, didn't you?

173
00:13:43,966 --> 00:13:45,500
Not only you told him

174
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:47,933
but...

175
00:13:55,533 --> 00:13:56,333
SONGJAM.

176
00:13:57,866 --> 00:13:59,466
I have to go now.

177
00:13:59,566 --> 00:14:00,633
So you're going out.

178
00:14:02,066 --> 00:14:05,000
Are you coming back late today?

179
00:14:05,866 --> 00:14:07,100
I'm not sure.

180
00:14:07,566 --> 00:14:10,266
So you're coming back late for sure.

181
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:14,300
If it's very late,
I will find a place around there to sleep.

182
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,100
What's wrong with you?

183
00:14:25,066 --> 00:14:25,866
I'm alright.

184
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,700
Come here.

185
00:14:31,966 --> 00:14:32,766
What are you doing?

186
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,300
Come closer.

187
00:14:35,366 --> 00:14:36,166
Why?

188
00:14:42,233 --> 00:14:43,033
If you miss me,

189
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:44,766
just remember this kiss.

190
00:14:46,633 --> 00:14:47,433
I have to go now.

191
00:14:59,100 --> 00:14:59,900
So...

192
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,833
tonight, both of you can stay over here.

193
00:15:05,866 --> 00:15:06,666
Alright, that works for me.

194
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,066
Tomorrow morning, I don't have any plans either.

195
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,200
Oh my god!

196
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,900
Where did the water come from?

197
00:16:18,266 --> 00:16:19,066
Oops!

198
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,466
Why does my face look so dull like this?

199
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,566
Oh no! Wrinkles have completely taken over.

200
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,266
I spent twenty thousand baht!

201
00:16:30,266 --> 00:16:32,666
I need to see the doctor!

202
00:16:33,966 --> 00:16:36,900
Oh no, I need to shut off the water valve first.

203
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,733
Now,

204
00:19:06,966 --> 00:19:09,700
you're like family to me now.

205
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:11,966
Can you feel it?

206
00:19:12,766 --> 00:19:16,400
Can you feel that... I exist?

207
00:19:16,433 --> 00:19:18,566
I'm not so sure.

208
00:19:18,566 --> 00:19:20,133
But I can feel...

209
00:19:20,133 --> 00:19:21,566
How?

210
00:19:21,766 --> 00:19:22,733
I can feel that...

211
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,900
Your hand is warm.

212
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,266
If miracles were real,

213
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:37,833
in the next two days,

214
00:19:38,466 --> 00:19:40,700
we might just meet for real.

215
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,033
If a miracle often happens,

216
00:19:43,033 --> 00:19:44,466
as you said,

217
00:19:44,866 --> 00:19:46,833
are you sure that is a so-called miracle?

218
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,966
Yes, of course.

219
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,466
Since I met you...

220
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,866
every day I wake up and see you,

221
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,100
I consider it a miracle for me.

222
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,366
Do you know what you have said?

223
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,166
[I miss you]

224
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:02,933
What is it?

225
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,866
I miss you too.

226
00:20:18,966 --> 00:20:20,000
I will try my best to be there with you.

227
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,100
I don't understand.

228
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,700
Which parts?

229
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,300
Aren't you surprised?

230
00:20:35,266 --> 00:20:37,100
When you heard me discussed with P'NAPHA.

231
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,366
At first, I was confused.

232
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:43,866
But when I thought about it,
it was quite possible.

233
00:20:43,866 --> 00:20:44,833
Possible?

234
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,966
I still can't believe it's possible.

235
00:20:48,466 --> 00:20:50,466
Nothing is impossible.

236
00:20:50,766 --> 00:20:52,500
Ever since we met.

237
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:58,000
We just happened to meet in a coffee shop, right?

238
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:04,900
It's like you who accidentally met someone
whose name is SONGJAM.

239
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,900
It's not quite the same.

240
00:21:15,366 --> 00:21:16,233
SONGJAM and I

241
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:18,800
can not touch each other.

242
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,266
It's more than a coincidence.

243
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,800
To have met is to have met.

244
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,933
It doesn't matter
if it's a coincidence or if it's a miracle.

245
00:21:30,566 --> 00:21:32,066
The most important thing is

246
00:21:32,766 --> 00:21:35,566
how your life has changed
after you have met.

247
00:21:38,566 --> 00:21:40,200
How...

248
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:42,466
has my life changed?

249
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:45,700
If it happens to be happier,

250
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:48,800
it is a coincidence or a miracle,

251
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,000
it's not important at all.

252
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,100
I see.

253
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:02,633
You...

254
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,800
love SONGJAM, don't you?

255
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,666
Until now...

256
00:22:13,366 --> 00:22:15,400
I'm not sure...

257
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,333
what love is?

258
00:22:17,433 --> 00:22:19,500
Do you want me to guide you about love?

259
00:22:20,866 --> 00:22:22,433
I'm just wondering

260
00:22:23,766 --> 00:22:24,900
what I'm facing

261
00:22:25,033 --> 00:22:26,366
is real.

262
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:28,500
And what I'm feeling

263
00:22:29,233 --> 00:22:30,966
is love or not.

264
00:22:33,433 --> 00:22:34,766
You already heard

265
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,700
SONGJAM and I

266
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,866
are from the different side of the mirror.

267
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:42,066
It's impossible to meet each other.

268
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,466
Do you remember the quantum physics story
I told you about?

269
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,666
Is it about that matter?

270
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,033
One substance can exist
in two places at the same time.

271
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,300
If one gets hurt...

272
00:22:58,666 --> 00:22:59,466
The other one will feel it too.

273
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,233
But if one side is happy...

274
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,900
...the other side will also experience happiness.

275
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,200
That's

276
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:11,633
what I call "love".

277
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:25,033
If that's called love,

278
00:23:26,033 --> 00:23:26,700
so...

279
00:23:27,633 --> 00:23:30,633
Now you know the answer, don't you?

280
00:23:32,233 --> 00:23:33,033
Yes, I know.

281
00:23:52,233 --> 00:23:54,866
Are you sure that I can bring it back?

282
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:56,166
Yes, you can.

283
00:23:57,066 --> 00:23:59,333
I think I will not upload the novel
on the website any longer.

284
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:02,766
Why?

285
00:24:04,633 --> 00:24:05,866
Once you go back and read it,

286
00:24:05,866 --> 00:24:06,666
you'll understand.

287
00:24:29,066 --> 00:24:30,200
Won't you read it?

288
00:24:31,066 --> 00:24:32,900
I still don't want to get spoiled.

289
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:34,633
Believe me.

290
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,800
Anyway, you can't stand it for long.

291
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:38,400
Once you arrive your room,

292
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,633
you have to secretly read it anyway.

293
00:24:40,233 --> 00:24:41,100
So...

294
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,833
You can read it right now.

295
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,700
You always have such a good idea.

296
00:25:00,133 --> 00:25:03,133
[Dance with me, please]

297
00:25:25,466 --> 00:25:26,266
Now I know the answer.

298
00:25:27,566 --> 00:25:30,466
Comet and aurora are the key to the whole story.

299
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:32,900
So...

300
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,166
If you were to disappear
along with these phenomena,

301
00:25:36,666 --> 00:25:37,600
I wouldn't be able to accept it either.

302
00:26:56,233 --> 00:27:01,633
[Because in this story it ends at...]

303
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,500
SONGJAM...

304
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,133
P'NAPHA... I'm wondering about the original...

305
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,966
The original is just that.

306
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,366
I don't know what will happen next.

307
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,100
SONGJAM!

308
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,500
SONGJAM!

309
00:28:01,266 --> 00:28:02,066
SONGJAM!

310
00:29:30,566 --> 00:29:31,966
I promise

311
00:29:32,266 --> 00:29:34,300
I will try my best to be there with you.

312
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,733
Don't promise the impossible.

313
00:29:38,266 --> 00:29:39,266
Right now

314
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:42,066
I just hoping you won't disappear
along with the meteor shower,

315
00:29:42,266 --> 00:29:44,566
and aurora. That's why I'm so thankful.

316
00:29:44,666 --> 00:29:46,100
I won't disappear.

317
00:29:46,766 --> 00:29:47,966
Promise me.

318
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,100
I promise.

319
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:36,500
Do you know

320
00:30:36,533 --> 00:30:38,433
any accommodation nearby?

321
00:30:38,433 --> 00:30:40,433
Right here under my feet!

322
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,500
Follow him!

323
00:30:46,966 --> 00:30:48,966
I'm looking for someone...

324
00:30:48,966 --> 00:30:50,533
Like SONGJAM in the novel?

325
00:30:50,533 --> 00:30:51,166
Yes.

326
00:30:51,166 --> 00:30:52,433
What'll happen next?

327
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:53,700
I haven't met him.

328
00:30:53,966 --> 00:30:56,700
[It's me, AKSORN]
But I think I will meet him soon.

329
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:58,900
SONGJAM.

330
00:31:03,266 --> 00:31:05,700
Finally I meet you, P'AKSORN.
