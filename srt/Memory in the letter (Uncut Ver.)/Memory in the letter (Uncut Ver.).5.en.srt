1
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,266
On my first day here,

2
00:00:43,266 --> 00:00:45,233
your world welcomed me in a rather confusing manner.

3
00:00:47,366 --> 00:00:48,166
I just couldn't understand

4
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,200
why your room

5
00:00:51,633 --> 00:00:53,200
turned into this dark storage space.

6
00:01:04,233 --> 00:01:05,200
Who are you?

7
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:06,666
How did you get in here?

8
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:07,866
Come over here.

9
00:01:07,866 --> 00:01:08,766
Are you a thief or something?

10
00:01:08,766 --> 00:01:10,333
I'm going to take you to the police.

11
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:11,333
Wait!

12
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,833
I don't know why I ended up here.

13
00:01:17,266 --> 00:01:19,600
Do you know someone named AKSORN?

14
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,766
AKSORN? Which AKSORN?

15
00:01:25,566 --> 00:01:27,100
Who are you, and where did you come from?

16
00:01:27,266 --> 00:01:28,833
How did you manage to get into my building?

17
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,500
There are rules here, you know.

18
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,900
No outsiders are allowed in the building.

19
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,366
Otherwise, I'll have to call the police.

20
00:01:33,766 --> 00:01:35,300
Oh, my apologies.

21
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:42,900
What year is it there, in the year B.E. (Buddhist Era)?

22
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,866
Do you mean the G.E. (God Era) year?

23
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,233
Here, it's only the God Era year.

24
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,433
Right now, it's the God Era year 165.

25
00:01:49,566 --> 00:01:51,066
Then, what year is it there?

26
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,066
Here, it is the Buddhist Era year 2565

27
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:59,466
Is it the Buddhist Era year 2538?

28
00:02:00,033 --> 00:02:00,900
Yes, it is.

29
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,366
Why?

30
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,933
What are you looking at?

31
00:04:39,266 --> 00:04:40,066
Sorry, sir.

32
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,300
Do you know

33
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,233
any accommodation nearby?

34
00:04:52,233 --> 00:04:53,700
I think you're not from around here.

35
00:04:55,766 --> 00:04:58,400
Where are you from? Or did you run away from home?

36
00:05:01,366 --> 00:05:02,600
Probably yes.

37
00:05:05,633 --> 00:05:08,266
There's no place to stay if you don't have money.

38
00:05:14,966 --> 00:05:16,300
Can I use this?

39
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:20,533
Sure.

40
00:05:22,766 --> 00:05:25,200
Could you please tell me where can I stay?

41
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:26,800
Right here, under my feet!

42
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:34,666
Follow him!

43
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,100
Follow him!

44
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:47,433
Hey, wait. Both of you, go that way.

45
00:05:58,033 --> 00:05:58,833
P'AKSORN...

46
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:00,966
Where are you?

47
00:06:02,266 --> 00:06:04,166
Why is your world so cruel?

48
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,700
Stay calm.

49
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,300
Are you okay?

50
00:06:47,466 --> 00:06:48,266
Thirsty?

51
00:06:55,466 --> 00:06:56,266
Please drink.

52
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:20,633
Be careful

53
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:28,533
Thanks so much.

54
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,500
I'm LIKIT, and you?

55
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,766
I...

56
00:07:37,566 --> 00:07:38,900
I'm SONGJAM.

57
00:07:42,366 --> 00:07:43,166
Lost, huh?

58
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,100
Or running away from home?

59
00:08:00,266 --> 00:08:02,833
So, lost or running away from home?

60
00:08:07,566 --> 00:08:08,366
Both, I guess.

61
00:08:13,266 --> 00:08:14,733
Do you have nowhere to go?

62
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:23,633
Hmm.

63
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,333
If you have nowhere to go,

64
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:28,633
how about coming to my place first?

65
00:08:41,966 --> 00:08:43,900
Hey, come on in!

66
00:08:45,433 --> 00:08:46,266
Hurry up!

67
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,966
Come in quickly!

68
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,833
Is today Christmas?

69
00:09:00,966 --> 00:09:01,766
Yes.

70
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:02,833
Why?

71
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,200
Hmm.

72
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:10,266
Oh, you're here.

73
00:09:11,966 --> 00:09:13,566
And who did you come with?

74
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:15,200
This is SONGJAM.

75
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,900
I met him at the playground.

76
00:09:18,133 --> 00:09:19,600
Do you know him?

77
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,900
He seems pitiful.

78
00:09:22,633 --> 00:09:26,200
I had you go out to buy food, but instead, you brought someone that you didn't know.

79
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,900
He has nowhere to go.

80
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,433
But he's a human, not a dog or a cat. We can't just bring him home like this.

81
00:09:32,966 --> 00:09:36,500
Why can't he stay with us? For me, you allowed me to stay with you here.

82
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,000
It's not the same.

83
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,100
How can't it be the same? We're  human.

84
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,033
What's your name?

85
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:53,133
My name is SONGJAM.

86
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:53,933
SONGJAM?

87
00:09:54,566 --> 00:09:56,066
It's an unusual name.

88
00:09:56,466 --> 00:09:58,033
Nowhere to go?

89
00:10:01,966 --> 00:10:03,266
I'm PALLOP.

90
00:10:04,366 --> 00:10:05,933
I will let you stay with us.

91
00:10:06,066 --> 00:10:07,466
But it's not free.

92
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:09,366
You have to pay rent to me.

93
00:10:09,533 --> 00:10:10,766
Do you have any money?

94
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,000
Hey!

95
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:17,366
You shouldn't ask him to pay for rent. This house is also your parents' house. I still haven't seen you pay your parents.

96
00:10:18,033 --> 00:10:19,433
There are still water and electricity bills to consider.

97
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,533
You can't just let him stay for free like this.

98
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,233
If it's this...

99
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,066
Can this be used?

100
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,000
Is this for real?

101
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,466
Are you a rich kid running away from home or something?

102
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,800
And your dad won't come after us, will he?

103
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:52,633
I don't have parents, actually.

104
00:10:58,466 --> 00:10:59,900
So, in summary...

105
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,000
Can this coin be used?

106
00:11:05,566 --> 00:11:06,866
It should work, I guess.

107
00:11:07,966 --> 00:11:08,766
In that case,

108
00:11:09,466 --> 00:11:11,166
You can stay as long as you want.

109
00:11:14,033 --> 00:11:14,833
Thanks so much.

110
00:11:17,266 --> 00:11:18,100
I have to go and prepare stuff.

111
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,433
Thank you for providing the meal.

112
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,700
I must also express my gratitude to both of you for allowing me to stay.

113
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:54,433
You know, I just realized that the coin I had is quite valuable here.

114
00:11:57,233 --> 00:11:58,866
You really don't know real gold, huh?

115
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,700
Where have you been living, anyway?

116
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:02,666
And please stop...

117
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:05,166
showing off that gold to the others,

118
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:06,500
you might get robbed, you know.

119
00:12:06,733 --> 00:12:07,566
Got it?

120
00:12:08,433 --> 00:12:09,233
Yes.

121
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:14,000
So, what did you buy at the market earlier?

122
00:12:15,066 --> 00:12:16,966
Oh, I totally forgot.

123
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,566
I thought there was something missing.

124
00:12:26,866 --> 00:12:27,666
Here it is.

125
00:12:30,466 --> 00:12:31,266
What's that tape?

126
00:12:32,633 --> 00:12:33,433
Let me play it for you.

127
00:12:43,866 --> 00:12:45,633
Don't say that you don't know how to use it!

128
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,533
Let me show you how to use it.

129
00:12:59,566 --> 00:13:00,800
Put the cassette here.

130
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,066
Press 'Play'

131
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:08,533
That's it!

132
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,300
Wait a moment.

133
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,066
But how does this song relate to Christmas?

134
00:13:34,433 --> 00:13:35,233
Well,

135
00:13:36,033 --> 00:13:38,266
someone once told me that.

136
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,266
P'AKSORN...

137
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,066
I've arrived in your world now.

138
00:14:04,066 --> 00:14:06,833
Even though I don't know when I'll meet you,

139
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,500
At least

140
00:14:09,966 --> 00:14:11,833
now I'm sure

141
00:14:12,433 --> 00:14:15,000
that we're on the same planet.

142
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,800
P'AKSORN...

143
00:14:19,866 --> 00:14:20,666
I miss you so much...

144
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,833
A tutoring guide for educational qualification exams?

145
00:14:34,433 --> 00:14:35,233
Yes.

146
00:14:35,266 --> 00:14:38,566
Before entering medical school, you have to pass the university entrance exam first.

147
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,266
After that day,

148
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,533
we've been living together for almost a year.

149
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,900
Everything seemed smooth.

150
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,333
I've learned that

151
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,033
the rules in this world are quite simple:

152
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:54,400
Just have money.

153
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,566
Nothing is difficult if you have money.

154
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,500
And because of this,

155
00:14:58,966 --> 00:14:59,900
finally,

156
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:03,566
each of us started living the way we should.

157
00:15:03,566 --> 00:15:06,166
How's it going, LIKIT? How's your study going?

158
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,900
Actually, you want to know

159
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,500
if any guys are flirting with me?

160
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,600
That's my next question!

161
00:15:13,866 --> 00:15:15,000
My study is going well,

162
00:15:15,266 --> 00:15:16,800
and there are no guys courting me.

163
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,133
Hi, SONGJAM.

164
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,533
How have you been? Are you feeling better?

165
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,966
Yes, I'm feeling better now.

166
00:15:27,766 --> 00:15:28,933
But...

167
00:15:28,933 --> 00:15:30,766
What's going on?

168
00:15:36,266 --> 00:15:37,066
Surprise!

169
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:39,633
I got into the university.

170
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:43,266
Congratulations!

171
00:15:43,933 --> 00:15:45,133
I was so shocked!

172
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,733
Oh, don't act like this again.

173
00:15:48,266 --> 00:15:49,666
You're so clever!

174
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,266
Look at this!

175
00:15:52,633 --> 00:15:54,233
Wow, that's really impressive!

176
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:56,600
Because I have a great teacher.

177
00:15:57,966 --> 00:15:59,333
Absolutely true!

178
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:00,466
Congrats!

179
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:24,800
What's wrong with you?

180
00:16:25,533 --> 00:16:28,166
Are you afraid to think of me?

181
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,466
Are you sick or something?

182
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,800
Someone like me is thinking about you?

183
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,800
You don't need to pretend.

184
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:44,466
P'PALLOP

185
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:46,966
This is for you.

186
00:16:49,433 --> 00:16:50,233
What is it?

187
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,400
Well,

188
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,300
since we started working together,

189
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,633
we haven't really used this.

190
00:17:03,233 --> 00:17:04,666
I still have a lot more.

191
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,100
Keep it for when I'm not around.

192
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,633
The two of us have bothered you a lot, SONGJAM.

193
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:14,700
For LIKIT,

194
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,400
I work and support myself.

195
00:17:17,233 --> 00:17:19,900
But you won't be able to go to continue your study.

196
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,933
It's okay.

197
00:17:21,633 --> 00:17:25,033
I'll work, earn money, and then continue my study later.

198
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,533
Please keep it with you.

199
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,200
For me,

200
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,100
I don't have any dreams

201
00:17:38,533 --> 00:17:40,200
that don't need much money.

202
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,533
I just want to see LIKIT follow her dreams.

203
00:17:43,533 --> 00:17:45,266
that makes me happy.

204
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,466
You should save money to support your girl.

205
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,000
So when I'm not here,

206
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,733
take care of each other.

207
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:55,966
Don't fight, okay?

208
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,200
Okay.

209
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,200
Default text

210
00:18:03,433 --> 00:18:04,233
I have to go for work now.

211
00:18:05,466 --> 00:18:06,266
See you.

212
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,800
And after SONGJAM learned how to cross dimensions,

213
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,666
What happened next?

214
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,933
SONGJAM crossed the dimensions to meet AKSORN.

215
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,400
That's it?

216
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:25,466
Just that.

217
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,966
Did they fall in love?

218
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,933
I don't know.

219
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,233
Oh, come on!

220
00:18:35,533 --> 00:18:36,333
Hey!

221
00:18:36,566 --> 00:18:37,800
I've told you

222
00:18:38,366 --> 00:18:40,066
everything I knew.

223
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,633
Could you continue writing the rest?

224
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:47,966
No, thanks.

225
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,400
I will wait for you to come back and write together.

226
00:18:52,033 --> 00:18:54,466
I chose the "SONGJAM" name to be the protagonist.

227
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:56,400
So you still have to come and help finish it.

228
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,200
Okay?

229
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,800
Okay!

230
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,600
Haven't you thought about sharing more?

231
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,833
Why did you escape?

232
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,033
You still haven't shared.

233
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,433
Do you want to hear my story?

234
00:19:17,566 --> 00:19:19,733
I've been waiting so long to hear your story.

235
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,766
My mother got a new husband.

236
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:36,333
And her husband was mistreating me.

237
00:19:41,466 --> 00:19:43,566
Then PALLOP came to help me.

238
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:45,666
He brought me here.

239
00:19:49,933 --> 00:19:51,833
Do you understand now?

240
00:19:53,766 --> 00:19:54,566
I understood.

241
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,166
Tell me your story.

242
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,000
My story?

243
00:20:04,266 --> 00:20:06,033
I'm currently looking for someone.

244
00:20:06,466 --> 00:20:07,266
Hey!

245
00:20:07,733 --> 00:20:09,600
It's like SONGJAM in a novel, right?

246
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,500
Yes.

247
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,900
So, what's next?

248
00:20:13,866 --> 00:20:14,933
I haven't met him yet.

249
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:20,533
But I think I'll meet him soon.

250
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:22,466
Hmm.

251
00:20:27,633 --> 00:20:29,400
Why? What are you thinking about?

252
00:20:29,933 --> 00:20:30,833
I'm thinking...

253
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,966
If the protagonist's name is in the novel

254
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,633
is the same as SONGJAM.

255
00:20:36,366 --> 00:20:37,833
Wouldn't that be good?

256
00:20:38,266 --> 00:20:39,133
Why?

257
00:20:39,933 --> 00:20:42,500
When you go to study,

258
00:20:42,633 --> 00:20:46,500
and when I and PALLOP read it, we might think of you.

259
00:20:47,533 --> 00:20:49,266
Change the name; it's better.

260
00:20:49,266 --> 00:20:50,166
Hey, don't do that.

261
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,233
Having the name SONGJAM is already good.

262
00:20:52,766 --> 00:20:53,566
Hmm.

263
00:20:55,866 --> 00:20:56,666
Hmm.

264
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,700
Well, then.

265
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,133
How about changing my name?

266
00:21:03,233 --> 00:21:04,033
Really?

267
00:21:04,966 --> 00:21:06,233
What should you change it to?

268
00:21:08,733 --> 00:21:09,700
I'm thinking...

269
00:21:11,533 --> 00:21:12,500
I have an idea.

270
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:14,633
You choose a name for me.

271
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,700
Me?

272
00:21:18,633 --> 00:21:21,466
How about a name in Japanese?

273
00:21:21,466 --> 00:21:22,266
What?

274
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,600
Hold on; let me get a translation book first.

275
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,066
Japanese...

276
00:21:33,466 --> 00:21:34,266
Wait a second.

277
00:21:35,966 --> 00:21:36,766
Are you sure?

278
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,000
What?

279
00:21:44,433 --> 00:21:45,733
Is that a name or what? Hey!

280
00:21:45,733 --> 00:21:46,200
Hold on.

281
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,933
Stay calm. I'm searching.

282
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:52,000
SONGJAM in Japanese language...

283
00:21:53,066 --> 00:21:54,166
KYOKU

284
00:21:55,233 --> 00:21:56,033
KYOKU

285
00:21:57,366 --> 00:21:58,166
KYO

286
00:21:59,233 --> 00:22:00,033
Do you like this name?

287
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:03,800
KYO?

288
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,900
Uh, it's okay.

289
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,400
Good.

290
00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:13,566
So...

291
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,600
Okay.

292
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,800
From now on, my name is KYO.

293
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,800
[5 years later]

294
00:22:34,366 --> 00:22:35,166
Doctor, Doctor?

295
00:22:38,633 --> 00:22:40,866
Doctor KYO, we have an emergency case.

296
00:22:41,133 --> 00:22:43,200
It's a case of a collision between a passenger car and a pickup truck.

297
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,133
Several people are injured.

298
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,533
Dr. WASIN has instructed you to go to the emergency room now.

299
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:48,900
Let's go.

300
00:22:49,266 --> 00:22:51,900
O RH- packed red cells 2 units!

301
00:22:58,733 --> 00:22:59,466
Dr. KYO.

302
00:22:59,466 --> 00:23:00,866
Take care of this case.

303
00:23:00,866 --> 00:23:01,333
Yes, sir.

304
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:02,100
Now!

305
00:23:14,533 --> 00:23:15,666
LIKIT!

306
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:30,966
Set OR and prepare for Ceasar now.

307
00:23:30,966 --> 00:23:31,600
Yes, sir.

308
00:23:33,766 --> 00:23:34,566
SONGJAM...

309
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,800
Help my child, please.

310
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,000
Don't worry.

311
00:23:42,866 --> 00:23:44,600
You and your child must be safe.

312
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,300
I'm...

313
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:20,733
I'm sorry.

314
00:25:26,433 --> 00:25:28,000
It's not your fault.

315
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,100
It's okay without a mother.

316
00:25:41,633 --> 00:25:43,366
I will take care of you,

317
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,700
AKSORN.

318
00:25:48,066 --> 00:25:48,866
AKSORN?

319
00:25:50,366 --> 00:25:51,166
Yes.

320
00:25:52,466 --> 00:25:54,000
LIKIT told me that

321
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,266
If our child is a boy,

322
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,133
name him AKSORN.

323
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:04,100
The same name as the protagonist of the novel she's written.

324
00:26:15,766 --> 00:26:16,566
Sawasdee krub (Hello, madam.)

325
00:26:16,733 --> 00:26:17,533
Sawasdee kha (Hello, sir.)

326
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,066
Are you KYO, who called a few days ago?

327
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:21,133
Yes, I am.

328
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,733
Your room is on the top floor, near the rooftop stairs.

329
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,433
Is there something?

330
00:26:30,933 --> 00:26:32,400
Have we met before?

331
00:26:34,133 --> 00:26:35,833
You might have remembered the wrong person.

332
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,333
May I see the room?

333
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:40,200
Yes, please.

334
00:26:51,633 --> 00:26:57,600
Now I know that it will be about twenty years before I meet AKSORN again.

335
00:26:59,633 --> 00:27:00,433
But then what?

336
00:27:01,066 --> 00:27:06,033
At least now I know that we will meet again on the same planet.

337
00:27:07,033 --> 00:27:09,066
That's more than enough.

338
00:27:19,366 --> 00:27:22,366
[Now is B.E. 2565]

339
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,500
[Today at 13:00, moving out]

340
00:28:19,066 --> 00:28:19,866
SONGJAM

341
00:28:20,466 --> 00:28:21,266
SONGJAM

342
00:28:24,033 --> 00:28:24,833
SONGJAM

343
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:12,100
[P'AKSORN]

344
00:29:23,933 --> 00:29:26,933
[P'AKSORN, It's me.]

345
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:29,066
SONGJAM.

346
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:47,566
Glad to see you again, P'AKSORN.

347
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,833
Why are you making that face?

348
00:30:36,033 --> 00:30:38,033
You've been waiting for a long time.

349
00:30:38,166 --> 00:30:39,100
No matter how long I have to wait,

350
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,600
I can wait.

351
00:30:41,033 --> 00:30:43,366
Merry Christmas for the both of us.

352
00:30:46,066 --> 00:30:47,566
I'm dating your son.

353
00:30:48,566 --> 00:30:50,933
SONGJAM, you better clear things up with me right now.

354
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:54,333
The novel that you said you would continue writing, what's it going to be about?

355
00:30:54,466 --> 00:30:58,866
It might be our story after this.

356
00:30:58,866 --> 00:31:01,866
Honestly, I think it could be even more romantic than this.

357
00:31:04,466 --> 00:31:06,300
It's quite simple.
