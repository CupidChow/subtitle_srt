1
00:00:44,233 --> 00:00:45,866
Memory in the Letter

2
00:00:45,866 --> 00:00:47,500
[They met for the first time through a mirror on a night when the shooting stars shine brightly.]

3
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,400
[They stared into each other's eyes and danced through the mirror on a starlit night.]

4
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,800
What?

5
00:01:12,033 --> 00:01:13,000
This is your iced coffee, sir

6
00:01:13,066 --> 00:01:14,000
Thanks.

7
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,500
Iced Americano, please.

8
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,666
Two pumps of syrup, right?

9
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:22,466
Yes.

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,800
May I have your name?

11
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:25,200
I'm AKSORN.

12
00:01:26,933 --> 00:01:28,300
You're AKSORN?

13
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:30,066
Yes, I am.

14
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:32,233
It's like the novel we read yesterday.

15
00:01:32,866 --> 00:01:36,633
Oh yeah, and they both like Americano.

16
00:01:36,733 --> 00:01:38,800
Are you the writer of this novel?

17
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:40,833
I don't think so.

18
00:01:41,366 --> 00:01:43,233
Have you read the latest chapter?

19
00:01:43,233 --> 00:01:44,500
That was super romantic!

20
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,966
When they danced together, right?

21
00:01:47,633 --> 00:01:49,200
I think it's so sad.

22
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,633
Sad?

23
00:01:51,566 --> 00:01:55,266
Smiling at each other, making eye contact,

24
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,033
feeling good together.

25
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:58,866
But it's only possible in his imagination,

26
00:01:59,133 --> 00:02:00,833
like dancing together.

27
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,200
I think it's really sad romantic.

28
00:02:04,633 --> 00:02:06,900
Nah, it's good romantic.

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,933
Go make coffee for the customer quickly.

30
00:02:10,933 --> 00:02:12,433
Oh!

31
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:13,233
I'm sorry for keeping you waiting.

32
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,133
This is your Iced Americano, sir.

33
00:02:24,133 --> 00:02:25,300
Thanks so much.

34
00:04:22,566 --> 00:04:23,366
Picker?

35
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:25,900
Who's Picker?

36
00:05:29,633 --> 00:05:31,566
Oh, you're early today.

37
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,266
Came early and got extra money, huh, bro?

38
00:05:34,266 --> 00:05:36,200
Oh, stop dreaming!

39
00:05:36,566 --> 00:05:38,166
You are stingy.

40
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:40,366
Well, you already know that, right?

41
00:05:41,266 --> 00:05:42,833
After work, are you free?

42
00:05:43,066 --> 00:05:43,966
Why?

43
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,566
Please be here with me

44
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:47,833
What's wrong with you?

45
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:50,533
I think...

46
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,533
I’m being stalked.

47
00:05:53,733 --> 00:05:55,733
Hey, did you figure it out yourself?

48
00:05:56,266 --> 00:05:58,000
How could I have figured it out? Look here.

49
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,566
Humm...

50
00:06:09,566 --> 00:06:11,766
I think I'm quite sure that I’m being stalked.

51
00:06:14,966 --> 00:06:17,766
And you know that writer who uses the pen name...

52
00:06:17,766 --> 00:06:18,566
Picker?

53
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,100
Picker?

54
00:06:20,766 --> 00:06:21,566
I'm not sure.

55
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,133
Why? Is the writer stalking you?

56
00:06:28,533 --> 00:06:31,700
I have an urgent matter to attend to right now, need to go now.

57
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:32,933
Take care of the shop, okay?

58
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,800
And don't worry about anyone threatening you.

59
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,566
Because I've got CCTV cameras all over the place.

60
00:06:37,566 --> 00:06:39,133
I'll check them in real time.

61
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,233
Take care of the shop.

62
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,166
Please wait a moment.

63
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:43,766
I have to go now!

64
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,466
Where is the CCTV camera?

65
00:07:15,366 --> 00:07:16,166
It's not here.

66
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:19,900
Maybe a lamp...

67
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,100
You scared me, bro.

68
00:07:42,266 --> 00:07:43,700
You're the one who scared me!

69
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,633
Are you not asleep yet?

70
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:47,900
I'm not feeling sleepy yet.

71
00:07:48,366 --> 00:07:50,400
Why? Are you waiting for me?

72
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:54,533
Why would I wait for you?

73
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,166
Why are you so narcissistic?

74
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,866
I'm not.

75
00:08:00,366 --> 00:08:01,800
But If you're waiting for me...

76
00:08:02,133 --> 00:08:03,666
it's almost Christmas time now.

77
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,900
I have to work the night shift.

78
00:08:07,366 --> 00:08:10,166
I'll probably get back home late.

79
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:11,400
Christmas day?

80
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,766
What is it?

81
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,800
Is there no Christmas in your world?

82
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:22,733
I think there isn't.

83
00:08:27,233 --> 00:08:31,800
Christmas is just on the 25th of December.

84
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,000
There's a festival where...

85
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,966
each family

86
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,366
holds parties,

87
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,666
celebrates together,

88
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:43,566
has meals together,

89
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,000
and also,

90
00:08:45,866 --> 00:08:47,600
exchanges gifts with each other.

91
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,200
Did you get it?

92
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:53,066
Hmm...

93
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,800
That's nice.

94
00:08:58,833 --> 00:08:59,633
Nice?

95
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,800
Why that expression?

96
00:09:04,966 --> 00:09:05,766
Actually...

97
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,866
I grew up alone.

98
00:09:12,033 --> 00:09:13,700
I've always done things alone.

99
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,000
Living alone, eating alone.

100
00:09:19,966 --> 00:09:21,500
So, I felt that...

101
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,866
But why are you all alone?

102
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,866
I...

103
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:48,800
Well, I apologize for asking like that. If you don't want to share, it's okay not to.

104
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,366
It's alright.

105
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:57,200
So, earlier, what were you looking for?

106
00:09:58,266 --> 00:10:01,200
Oh, I was looking for a CCTV camera.

107
00:10:01,566 --> 00:10:04,800
CCTV camera?

108
00:10:09,466 --> 00:10:11,933
In your world, do you have CCTV cameras?

109
00:10:12,133 --> 00:10:15,500
They are used to monitor the house, the office, you know, to ensure security and stuff.

110
00:10:15,566 --> 00:10:19,733
and maintain safety measures, and etc.

111
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:23,666
In my world, there are CCTV cameras too.

112
00:10:26,533 --> 00:10:28,500
Oh! Okay okay.

113
00:10:29,266 --> 00:10:30,433
Why were you looking for it?

114
00:10:30,633 --> 00:10:32,200
Is there someone who installed it?

115
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,300
If I were to say...

116
00:10:39,566 --> 00:10:41,100
someone took our story...

117
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,300
and wrote it as an online novel,

118
00:10:44,766 --> 00:10:45,566
do you believe it?

119
00:10:46,366 --> 00:10:47,166
Seriously?

120
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:49,700
How could anyone know about us?

121
00:10:52,433 --> 00:10:53,233
Let's see...

122
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,133
So, are you saying...

123
00:11:13,966 --> 00:11:15,566
someone's writing stories about us, right?

124
00:11:15,566 --> 00:11:16,600
Yes!

125
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,733
And all of this is based on true story, isn't it?

126
00:11:20,066 --> 00:11:21,333
Yes, sure.

127
00:11:21,366 --> 00:11:23,333
Look! What parts aren't real?

128
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,300
[AKSORN’s heart beats.
He wonders how he truly feels…]

129
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,000
[He couldn't understand why the eyes of the man on the other side of the mirror had such an effect on his heart's rhythm.]

130
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:56,933
So you do believe this is real, isn't it?

131
00:11:58,533 --> 00:11:59,333
Yes, of course.

132
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,200
Anyway...

133
00:12:17,133 --> 00:12:19,600
Let's focus on the writer

134
00:12:21,233 --> 00:12:23,466
Yeah, I think so...

135
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:29,566
Do you think it's possible...

136
00:12:30,366 --> 00:12:32,866
that this person comes from the future?

137
00:12:34,533 --> 00:12:35,766
Hold on for a moment.

138
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:43,666
Just the parallel universe and the story is already strange enough. Let's not jump to the conclusion that someone from the future is involved.

139
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:48,266
However...

140
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:49,900
I sent an email to this writer

141
00:12:51,033 --> 00:12:52,000
We should have an answer soon.

142
00:12:58,433 --> 00:12:59,233
And...

143
00:13:00,266 --> 00:13:01,433
About what you read earlier...

144
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,100
is it true or not?

145
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,566
Maybe I should find out about the security cameras.

146
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,700
SONGJAM

147
00:14:02,766 --> 00:14:03,566
SONGJAM!

148
00:14:04,433 --> 00:14:05,233
Please turn down the volume.

149
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,466
I thought you liked it.

150
00:14:08,466 --> 00:14:10,000
Yes, I liked it.

151
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,900
But the next room didn't like it.

152
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,233
And if they come over to complain,

153
00:14:15,266 --> 00:14:17,166
and find out there's no sound system in my room,

154
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,833
How will I respond?

155
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,200
I don't want anyone to know about our weird situation.

156
00:14:28,066 --> 00:14:28,866
You're right.

157
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,800
What if someone finds out about both of us?

158
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,166
You'll surely be investigated.

159
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,500
If that's the case,

160
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:40,633
We might never see each other again.

161
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,966
Then I'll try to keep the volume down.

162
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,233
By the way...

163
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,266
Have you stopped feeling embarrassed around me?

164
00:15:01,866 --> 00:15:03,866
You're a pervert!

165
00:15:10,933 --> 00:15:12,766
Tonight, don't rush to sleep, okay?

166
00:15:13,466 --> 00:15:14,266
Why?

167
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,000
You'll see!

168
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,666
It's Christmas with rain falling...

169
00:15:44,966 --> 00:15:46,633
doesn't seem to match at all.

170
00:15:47,566 --> 00:15:49,766
Oh!, P'KYO

171
00:15:51,266 --> 00:15:52,633
I agree with you.

172
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,833
Who'd have thought it would rain today?

173
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,300
I think...

174
00:15:58,033 --> 00:15:59,533
Let's find something warm to drink...

175
00:15:59,733 --> 00:16:01,033
while waiting for the rain to ease off.

176
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:03,633
It's a good idea.

177
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,100
Here you are.

178
00:16:09,633 --> 00:16:10,433
Thanks so much.

179
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,700
I think you're not like others.

180
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,700
It's winter but you're still carrying the umbrella.

181
00:16:22,066 --> 00:16:23,433
I saw the sky wasn't clear...

182
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,566
So, I just grabbed it.

183
00:16:25,733 --> 00:16:28,500
You probably didn't come from the future, did you?

184
00:16:30,433 --> 00:16:32,200
Have you been reading too many sci-fi novels, haven't you?

185
00:16:33,966 --> 00:16:35,066
Because of you...

186
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,466
You've not suggested a quantum physics book for me.

187
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:41,766
Are you still interested?

188
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,500
It's quite difficult for me to give up.

189
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,400
I think I'll keep reading until...

190
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,833
it explains all the weird stuff.

191
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:53,333
Weird stuff?

192
00:16:56,266 --> 00:17:01,533
I mean the strange occurrences in our universe.

193
00:17:02,533 --> 00:17:05,800
So, you'll have to read for the rest of your life, huh?

194
00:17:07,033 --> 00:17:08,300
Yea!

195
00:17:10,233 --> 00:17:12,066
Especially for quantum physics...

196
00:17:12,066 --> 00:17:15,066
The more I read, the more peculiar it gets.

197
00:17:15,066 --> 00:17:17,000
How?

198
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,166
Well...

199
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,466
I stumbled upon it in a book. It said...

200
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:26,966
An atom

201
00:17:26,966 --> 00:17:29,366
can be in two places at the same time.

202
00:17:30,066 --> 00:17:33,500
It means if we do something with this atom,

203
00:17:33,766 --> 00:17:38,700
another atom can feel the same.

204
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,166
I think, an atom...

205
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,933
has no feeling.

206
00:17:51,566 --> 00:17:53,566
I'm just making a comparison.

207
00:17:56,766 --> 00:17:58,600
It might be similar to what you're saying.

208
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:03,000
If we do something to an atom here,

209
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,066
and another identical atom elsewhere,

210
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,066
they should have the same impact.

211
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,966
Can it be like that?

212
00:18:13,966 --> 00:18:15,000
I don't understand.

213
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,833
That's why I say it's romantic.

214
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,566
How can it be romantic, though?

215
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,366
It's like you're loving someone,

216
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,300
If another person feels hurt,

217
00:18:30,466 --> 00:18:31,666
No matter how far apart you are,

218
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,100
You'll hurt the same.

219
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:41,900
I want to hand you a face towel.

220
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,766
Even though we're in different worlds,

221
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,433
I'll always be by your side.

222
00:18:58,066 --> 00:18:58,866
I see.

223
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,666
Merry Chrit...mas

224
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:26,466
P'AKSORN...

225
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,166
I'm sorry...

226
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:32,266
Today, there's an event at school.

227
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:33,966
That's okay.

228
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,400
Please take a rest.

229
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,400
Are we not celebrating Christmas together?

230
00:20:43,733 --> 00:20:45,033
It is now the day after Christmas.

231
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:46,800
No, it's not.

232
00:20:47,466 --> 00:20:48,766
It's been 17 minutes already.

233
00:20:51,066 --> 00:20:52,166
No, it isn't.

234
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,266
My time is now 11:17 p.m.

235
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,566
Is your wristwatch broken?

236
00:21:01,566 --> 00:21:03,433
This is my actual time in my world.

237
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,400
Well...

238
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,966
Do you remember that today is Christmas?

239
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:11,633
I haven't forgotten.

240
00:21:12,766 --> 00:21:13,666
I know...

241
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:16,033
what you're going to do.

242
00:21:17,033 --> 00:21:17,833
Are you sure?

243
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:19,633
Well...

244
00:21:21,466 --> 00:21:23,466
You've prepared some treats for us, right?

245
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,033
Then, close your eyes.

246
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,700
Close your eyes, please.

247
00:21:54,433 --> 00:21:55,233
Now, open your eyes.

248
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,600
That's beautiful.

249
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:10,433
Merry Christmas.

250
00:22:12,633 --> 00:22:15,266
So, how am I going to eat?

251
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,366
If we meet again, I will cook this menu for you.

252
00:22:19,566 --> 00:22:21,233
I also have something for you.

253
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,833
Merry Christmas

254
00:22:37,233 --> 00:22:39,333
Is that for me?

255
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:40,633
Yes, this is for you.

256
00:22:41,433 --> 00:22:42,233
Well...

257
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,466
I know your world might have things like this.

258
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,266
But I want to be the one to give to you.

259
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,766
You can use it to write...

260
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,300
your...

261
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,700
memories.

262
00:23:01,366 --> 00:23:02,166
How will I use it?

263
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,800
Well...

264
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,600
When we'll meet,

265
00:23:10,866 --> 00:23:11,833
I'll be the one to give it to you.

266
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:13,966
That's a promise.

267
00:23:15,266 --> 00:23:16,066
I won't take my word back.

268
00:23:23,433 --> 00:23:25,566
It feels like something's missing.

269
00:23:25,566 --> 00:23:27,400
I'm missing that I can't eat with you, right?

270
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,866
I just said I'd make it for us to eat together.

271
00:23:33,966 --> 00:23:35,866
Oh, I already know what's missing.

272
00:23:42,066 --> 00:23:42,866
A song...

273
00:23:49,566 --> 00:23:52,500
Before, whenever there was a celebration,

274
00:23:53,733 --> 00:23:56,066
Dad always liked to play this song.

275
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,100
The melody is quite good.

276
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,433
But it's a pity my world doesn't have this song.

277
00:24:07,266 --> 00:24:08,066
Our two worlds

278
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,266
many things that are similar.

279
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,700
And many things are not.

280
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,966
Like Christmas in my world,

281
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,200
but not in yours.

282
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:24,966
But...

283
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,500
now...

284
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:30,100
You've made my world

285
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,800
include you now.

286
00:24:37,966 --> 00:24:40,566
You and dad seem close.

287
00:24:45,566 --> 00:24:46,366
That's all it was before.

288
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,400
Anyway...

289
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,866
You've never shared about your family with me.

290
00:24:59,166 --> 00:24:59,966
I don't have one.

291
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,066
My parents aren't around anymore.

292
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:12,666
I'm sorry. I shouldn't talk about this.

293
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,033
It's okay.

294
00:25:19,366 --> 00:25:20,166
Now,

295
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:22,800
you're like family to me now.

296
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,500
Thanks so much...

297
00:25:30,433 --> 00:25:32,033
for coming into my life.

298
00:26:03,133 --> 00:26:03,900
What's up?

299
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,600
It's a day off today, isn't it?

300
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,300
But I still have to work.

301
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,000
Don't be upset.

302
00:26:11,966 --> 00:26:13,733
I have to go now.

303
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,133
So, hurry back today.

304
00:26:16,133 --> 00:26:18,433
I'll wait for you to watch a movie.

305
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,866
Hey, watch the movie with me.

306
00:26:21,233 --> 00:26:22,666
Don't rush to finish it.

307
00:26:24,133 --> 00:26:25,333
I won't promise.

308
00:26:26,633 --> 00:26:27,800
You won't promise?

309
00:26:39,233 --> 00:26:40,033
Gotta go now.

310
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:43,033
Hurry back.

311
00:26:56,233 --> 00:26:59,233
[Does anyone know the writer's pen name - "Picker"? I want to contact the writer.]

312
00:27:04,233 --> 00:27:05,800
Hey, didn't you say that today's customers will be busy?

313
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:07,633
It should.

314
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,200
Usually, on holidays, our shop should be full of customers, right?

315
00:27:13,266 --> 00:27:15,166
These days, people don't read books anymore, do they?

316
00:27:16,033 --> 00:27:17,700
What did you say?!

317
00:27:18,666 --> 00:27:19,600
Just kidding!

318
00:27:20,866 --> 00:27:23,366
You can go back now; I'll pay the full amount for you.

319
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,433
Is that true?

320
00:27:24,433 --> 00:27:25,333
Sure!

321
00:27:25,733 --> 00:27:27,166
Thanks so much, sir.

322
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,700
Hello, young man! What can I do for you?

323
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,866
Hello, sir!

324
00:28:23,866 --> 00:28:26,500
Can you see who entered here, sir?

325
00:28:27,566 --> 00:28:30,800
Today, it's just only you here.

326
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,833
What kind of music do you want to listen to?

327
00:28:34,166 --> 00:28:36,733
So I can suggest you.

328
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,500
Vinyl records?

329
00:28:43,433 --> 00:28:45,700
Just forget about it.

330
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,366
How about helping me choose vinyl records now?

331
00:28:49,966 --> 00:28:51,366
Left or right?

332
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,966
That smile! Are you thinking of the person you love, aren't you?

333
00:29:06,666 --> 00:29:07,466
Uh...

334
00:29:08,966 --> 00:29:12,566
Nah, just thinking about my younger brother.

335
00:29:17,566 --> 00:29:19,566
I thought you'd happily run back to your room.

336
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:20,933
Are you crazy or what?

337
00:29:20,966 --> 00:29:22,466
I've left everything here.

338
00:29:23,166 --> 00:29:26,300
Um, the post you asked about has received some responses.

339
00:29:26,733 --> 00:29:27,600
Really?

340
00:29:27,633 --> 00:29:28,666
Yes, let's check.

341
00:29:30,033 --> 00:29:31,366
[Does anyone know the writer named Picker?]

342
00:29:33,166 --> 00:29:36,166
[I don't know but I used the writer's email to search. I got the address. The writer is at Nakhon Pathom.

343
00:29:38,366 --> 00:29:39,166
P'NAY...

344
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,100
Today, you told me to go back home early, right?

345
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:42,866
Yes.

346
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:44,366
So, can I borrow your car?

347
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:46,000
Sure, where are you going?

348
00:29:46,033 --> 00:29:47,266
Nakhon Pathom. Thanks!

349
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:54,066
Why's he so hurrying? What's wrong with him?

350
00:29:55,166 --> 00:29:56,000
Nakhon Pathom?

351
00:30:25,366 --> 00:30:26,166
What's that sound?

352
00:30:31,466 --> 00:30:32,900
Oops, water leakage!

353
00:30:50,966 --> 00:30:54,166
Hello boy, don't forget our appointment tonight!

354
00:30:55,533 --> 00:30:56,600
Okay!

355
00:31:00,766 --> 00:31:03,000
Just a second, my dear. I'll call back soon.

356
00:31:06,666 --> 00:31:07,600
Hello, Auntie SOOK.

357
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:10,633
There's water flowing out from Room 603.

358
00:31:19,566 --> 00:31:20,366
Oh my god!

359
00:31:21,533 --> 00:31:22,766
Where did the water come from?

360
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,300
Oh! AKORN's books are wet!

361
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,700
Oops!

362
00:31:30,333 --> 00:31:33,466
Will he be mad at me?

363
00:31:35,133 --> 00:31:36,466
All books are wet!

364
00:32:19,733 --> 00:32:21,533
Where are you headed? Do you need a ride?

365
00:32:21,533 --> 00:32:22,700
I'm going to see a writer.

366
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,700
Let's go by my car.

367
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,766
Why don't you ask me about what's happening?

368
00:32:25,766 --> 00:32:29,333
If it's important to you, I'd be happy to help.

369
00:32:29,333 --> 00:32:34,400
Yesterday, I wouldn't have known what it was like without P'KYO's support.

370
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:36,933
