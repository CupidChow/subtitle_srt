<i>the school library</i>

4
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,320

<i>Although it is a harbor of knowledge,</i>

6
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,880

STUDENT TRANSFER REQUEST

17
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,200
Kaew and her friends
tried to give their cheat sheet to her.

18
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,440
I heard Kaew say

19
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,480
that she should write down
the right answers

20
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,000
and share them during the exam

21
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,840
or Kaew would get her.

22
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,200
Get her?

23
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,920
Yes, ma'am.

24
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,680
She looked terrified.
Her arms were bruised from being squeezed.

25
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,160
It seemed serious, so I came to tell you.

26
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,200
Thank you very much
for telling me.

27

After this,

28
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,200
I'll properly consider
those students' punishment.

29
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,760
Excuse me, Madam Principal.

Goodbye.

Hey, have you seen Saiparn?

35
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,096
- Hey, have you seen Saiparn?
- No, I haven't.

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,760
Hey. Have you seen Saiparn?

37
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,280
Kaew, I don't see her anywhere.

38
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,240
Maybe she already ran home.

39
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,920

you sure wasted my time, Saiparn.

- Let me go!
- Such a snitch, aren't you?

45
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,200
This is the library.

46
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,560
Be quiet in here.

47
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,680
If you must be so loud, please go outside.

48
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,040
I don't wanna be here anyway.

Shall I help you arrange the books?

56
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,640
Hmm.

57
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,120
Start with that pile behind you, then.
Put it in the other room for me.

Not at all.

FAMILY BELIEVES TEACHER ABDUCTED, KILLED

70
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,400
Miss.

71
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,960
Is that our school in the news?

72
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,880
FAMILY BELIEVES TEACHER ABDUCTED, KILLED

73
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,960
Yes, it is.

74
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,080
His family told the police
that he'd gone to work as usual that day,

75
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,080
but he never came home in the evening.

76
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,560
Many teachers said
that the last place he visited

77
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,720
was probably this room.

78
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:26,480
Then people started speculating
that he might have died or gone missing.

79
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,920
Actually, this rumor made some people
scared of using the library.

80
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,880
Do you think

81
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,040
that teacher

82
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,040
died in this room?

83
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,800
Does that frighten you?

84
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,480
I've been here for so long,

85
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,240
and I've seen nothing scary.

86
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,520
People keep spreading
rumors of strange things though.

87
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,160
Haven't you heard
any tales about this school?

88
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,760
No, I haven't.

89
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,400
I just transferred here.

90
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,160
So, what happened here?

91
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,160
They say that 20 years ago,

92
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,560
a female student named Ploypoom

93
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,640
was bullied by her classmates
and locked up in the toilets.

94
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,480
And no one knew.

95
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,800
She endured that torment
in there for three months

96
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,560
until she decided to kill herself

97
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,640
in the toilets upstairs

98
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,480
right above this library.

99
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,440
Before she died,

100
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,120
she recorded her intense pain and torment

101
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,440
in a book.

102
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,640
A book?

103
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,320
Friends

104
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,480
were all she wanted...

105
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,240
but they ended up killing her.

106
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,720
It's so tragic for a defenseless person
to die from bullying.

107
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,240
It must be some sort of hidden pain
you can't tell anyone about.

108
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,600
But sometimes,

109
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,800
it's about who you choose to tell.

110
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,080
Don't let that happen to you.

111
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,280
If you have any problems, you can tell me.

112
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,880
Think of me as a friend.

113
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,200
Let me help you.

114
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,560
It's all right.

115
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,880
What is that? It smells so strong.

116
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:35,160
A kind of chemical
used to preserve tissue, I think.

117
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,560
Lately, the science department
has used lots of it.

118
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,760
But how come
I could smell this at the library?

119
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,840
Well...

120
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,040
Uncle Daeng.

121
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,960
Yes, miss?

- Do you have a moment?
- Oh, yes, miss.

124
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,920
Can you look at this ceiling?

125
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,680
There's a hole,
so there's water leaking out.

126
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,600
Oh, of course, miss.

on the last day of the semester,
a female student named Ploypoom

130
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,200
<i>was bullied by her classmates</i>

131

<i>right above this library.</i>

133
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,120
Hey. What?

134
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,040
Come here.

135
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,760
Go inside.

136
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,800
Get inside, Saiparn. Come here.

137
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,040
You almost got us expelled.

138
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,360
Sorry to disappoint you,

139
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,480
but I'm not going anywhere.

140
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,520
I'll keep you company

141
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,520
for a very long time.

142
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,840
Quit being a bitch, Kaew.

143
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,240
Just own up to your mistakes.

144
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,520
Don't preach at me!

145
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,440
How dare you
stick your nose in my business?

146
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,360
I'll stay away from you guys from now on.

147
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,320
You stay away from me too.

148
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,840
Step aside.

149
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,880
I told you to back off.

150
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,920
Stay here and repent, Saiparn.

151
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,400
Nosy bitch!

152

Kaew!

154
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,240
Kaew!

155
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,480
Kaew, let me go!

156
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,600
Kaew! You...

157

Saiparn!

158
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,400
They did that to you?

159
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,600
Why didn't you tell anyone?

160
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,160
I can help you.

161
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,440
It's okay, miss.

162
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,080
You wouldn't be able to help anyway.

163

what happened to her bullies after that.

that they were arrested

00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,440
After that,

234
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:43,120
they killed each other in the cell.

that they died

whatever gets written in the book

240

nobody would have written about them.

Why are you so interested in this
all of a sudden?

Miss.

You've read my story, haven't you?

348
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,400
A young woman who just graduated...

349
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,840
was determined to be a good teacher.

350
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,240
But she ended up being isolated

351
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,080
because her colleagues didn't like her.

352
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,960
She was slandered

353
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,480
day after day...

354
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,840
until...

NARIN PINTONGKAM, LIBRARIAN

356
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,400
<i>...she met a male teacher...</i>

<i>who offered her friendship.</i>

358
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,080
<i>She thought she had found a true friend.</i>

359
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,480
- Stay still.

360
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,280

<i>and her soul.</i>

362
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,520
She wanted to die...

363
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,200
<i>but she couldn't.</i>

364
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,960
The moral of the story is...

365
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,680
...that the one who deserved to die

366
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,800
was that bastard.

367
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,120
<i>I wrote that the son of a bitch died here.</i>

368

<i>Isn't it great, Saiparn?</i>

369
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,080
Didn't he deserve it?

370
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,560
Why do you look so upset, Saiparn?

371
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,360
You hated that girl so much,
you wanted her to die, right?

372
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,920
But I didn't want Kaew to die.

373
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,720
What happened to you
and the others who wrote in that book?

374
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,640
I had to trade my body

375
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,840
and my soul

376
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,720
for the wish I wrote in the book.

I know you wanted revenge!
You wanted her dead!

387
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,160
Karma's a bitch,

388
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,840
and then you die.

389

We just helped you fulfill your wish...

390

...and made it come true, that's all.

391
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,440
A hundred times more pain.

392
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,560
You must die!

393
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:43,240
Let us stay friends forever, Saiparn.

394
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,520
No. I'm scared. No.

395
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,680
