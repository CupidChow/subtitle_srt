Yeah, I did.

What we're going through right now,

is it a curse,

If it's really a ghost,

I guess Q doesn't need to get here
so early anymore, right?

95
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,520
Auan!

96
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,240
What Q does for us these days works,
doesn't it?

Can't we just be patient for now?

98

Hey, what if Q woke up late
or forgot to tell us?

99

What would we do then?

100
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,960
Well, what else could we do?

101
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,920
His place is closest to school,
so he should make sacrifices.

102
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Right, Q?

103
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,640
Would anyone living farther away
swap with him?

104
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,016
- Would you come at seven?
- Would you?

105
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,560
- No!
- Me neither.

106
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,720
I'd rather sleep.

107
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,360
- No.
- I changed my mind. No.

108
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,520
- No.
- I wouldn't do it.

109
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,600
- I wouldn't.
- I, for one, wouldn't.

110
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,520
- I'm so tired.
- Hey.

111
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,560
- Weren't you being too harsh?
- I didn't do shit.

112
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,400
- What's with him?
- Q.

113
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,640
Can you leave home earlier?

114
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,960
You see, I have to leave home
with my dad at 6:30 a.m.

115
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,200
And if I had to wait for you,

116
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,640
I'd be late.

117
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,280
And besides,

118
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,800
I bring all my books in case I need any.

119
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,520
It's too much, Q.

120
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,920
- Would you come at seven?
- Would you?

121
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,400
- No!
- I wouldn't do it.

122
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,840
Hey, are you listening?

123
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,496
<i>If it's really a ghost...</i>

124
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,760
He should make sacrifices.

125
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,640
Do you understand me, Q?

126
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,800
<i>- I'll piss in...
- ...works, doesn't it?</i>

00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,920
Hey, Q!

128
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,480
I've already tried to get here early.

129

I'm asking you to try harder, man.

130
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,000
Enough, Vaan.

131
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,720
Q has already done so much for us.

132
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,840
If Q could do any more for us,

133
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,520
he'd probably do it anyway.

134
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,840
Don't pressure him.

135
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,560
But he...

136
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,640
I'll try.

137
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,920
We'll see.

138
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,680

- NOT: SHIT. Q, ARE YOU BAILING ON US?
- TONG.G: HURRY, Q, OR I'LL BE LATE

161
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,600
THAI LITERATURE

00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,480
Q.

163
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,160
Ronnapee.

164
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,240
What's wrong?

165
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,040
- Nothing, sir.
- Get up, then.

166
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,840
What's wrong?

167
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,600
You look like you've seen a ghost.

168
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,520
What did you see? Tell me.

169
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,800
Everyone, let's continue.

170
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,440
Turn to page 52.

171
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,200
WITTAYA

172
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,520
- Vaan, are you going home?
- I have an English class.

173
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,360
Why were you late today?

174
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:46,960
Hey.

175
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,520
I overslept.

176
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,160
Are you sure?

177
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,480
Prem from Room One told me

178
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,280
that he saw you having breakfast
downstairs this morning.

179
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,880
Q.

180
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,560
Were you just having breakfast?

181
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,320
Prem must have seen you having breakfast
after you sent us the photo. Right, Q?

182
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,480
- Not.
- Hey.

183
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,560
Not, stop it.

184
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,480
Let go of me.

185
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,680
He's lying.

186
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,760
I don't trust him.

187
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,440
Would you swap places with him?

188
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,600
So that's settled.

189
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,720
Let's all go home.

190
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,480
Q.

191
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,040
I hope you get here earlier tomorrow
so that we won't all be late.

192
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,600
I feel bad for Vaan.

193
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:57,040
Hey, Q, for tomorrow,
just get here before 7:00 a.m., okay?

194
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,760
Don't you all know

195
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,200
that if I get here that early,

196
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,040
something will happen to me?

197
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,880
Do you believe that stuff?

198
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,920
That old story?

199
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,640
Shit, ghosts don't write
on boards in the morning.

200
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,200
If they could write,
they'd do it at night.

201
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,440
If you don't believe it, then tell me,

202
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,760
how did that name get on that chair?

203
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,200
Go on. Read it.

204
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,240
What does it say?

205
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,040
WITTAYA

206
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,320
Wittaya.

207
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,880
What?

208
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,040
- What's he talking about?
- I don't know.

209
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,160
Don't you remember?

210
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,360
The teacher said that name.

211
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,000
It's on the chair,
and it's on the list of students.

212
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,600
So it's possible

213
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,760
that Wittaya was our friend,

214
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,360
but we can't remember him.

215
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,160
Do you ever think about that?

216
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,320
If you don't want to do it,

217
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,080
just say so.

218
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,040
Don't make up this bullshit.

219
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,920
I'm telling you, we don't buy it.

220
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,920
If you don't buy it,

221
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,800
come and prove it with me tomorrow.

222
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,160
Would you dare, Not?

223
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,600
And you, Big?

224
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,680
And you?

225
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,160
You'll have to come anyway.

226
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,920
Why should we?

227
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,400
You want to prove it?

228
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,680
You don't need our help.

229
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,600
It's your job,

230
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,560
so do it.

231
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,880
If you don't do what we tell you,

232
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,360
tomorrow, we won't let you
join our group project

233
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,440
that the teacher just assigned.

234
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,480
We'll make you do it
for the whole class instead.

235
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,600
- You do it.
- Hey.

236
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,920
Q, I guess you don't have to come
so early anymore,

237
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,400
so you can do the work
for the whole class. How's that?

238
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,680
That'll work.

239
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,600
Let's go, Q.

240
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,760
Not.

241
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,360
<i>Have you ever thought of me
as a friend, or am I just your doormat?</i>

242
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,080
<i>I've always thought of you guys
as my friends,</i>

243
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,280
<i>but I guess you've never felt the same.</i>

244
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,800
<i>Be strong.
At least you still have us.</i>

245
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,520
<i>We're your friends. Hang in there.</i>

246
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,240
<i>If they
don't see you as a friend,</i>

247
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,480
<i>don't think of them as yours.</i>

248
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,880
<i>I'm always here for you.
Don't give a damn about them.</i>

249
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,400
Come on, Q. Let's go home.

250
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,480
<i>Be strong. I'm here for you.</i>

251
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,640
<i>I'll be your friend.</i>

252
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,360
<i>Life is a school
full of tests and lessons to learn.</i>

253
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,280
<i>Hang in there.</i>

254
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,600
<i>You're finally there.
I've been waiting.</i>

255
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,840
<i>Yeah, just go
so we can see if there's a ghost.</i>

256
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,880
<i>- Hurry up, Q. My dad's leaving.
- Come on. Don't be a wuss.</i>

257
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,000
<i>Don't pressure him.</i>

258
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,760
<i>- Go yourself if you're in such a hurry.
- Turn on the camera.</i>

259
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,320
ROOM 6/4

260
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,800
- TAN: DON'T PRESSURE HIM
- NOT: TURN ON THE CAMERA

261
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,920
MATHEMATICS

262
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,480
MATHEMATICS

263
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,400
Are you satisfied now?

264
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,920
MATHEMATICS

265
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,520
Q. Q.

266
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,040
Are you satisfied now?

267
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,600
Q.

268
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,360
Q, are you okay?

269
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,600
While you were on the video call,

270
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,760
the camera went off.

271
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,280
So we rushed to find you, and we found you
unconscious in front of the classroom.

272
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,440
Tan, did you see anything?

273
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,600
Right. Wait a second.
Someone recorded it. I'll show you.

274
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,240
Have a look.

275
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:38,840
MATHEMATICS

276
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,600
Q, are you okay?

277
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,480
I think it'd be dangerous

278
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,880
if you had another episode
when you were alone.

279
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,920
It's okay.

280
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,480
I can handle it.

281
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,920
Let's get back to class.

282
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,360
Hmm.

283
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,040
Q, are you really okay?

284
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,000
Why are you so quiet?

285
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,640
- What's with Q?
- What the hell?

286
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,160
- Did he faint?
- What's with him?

287
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,800
- He fell suddenly.
- Did he faint?

288
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,400
- I don't know.
- Shit. Did he drool?

289
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,480
That's weird.

290
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,720
What is it, Auan?

291
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,600
Listen, I forgot
to bring the book.

292
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,680
Didn't you know which one to bring?

293
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,760
Of course I knew.
I already put it in my bag.

294
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,520
Maybe I grabbed the wrong one.

295
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,760
- Check the classroom again.
- Okay.

296
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,720
Check again.

297
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,440
- Do you even care?
- I don't know. I skipped it.

298
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,640
Q.

299
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,840
What's wrong with you?

300
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,920
Nothing.

301
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,640
I think Q was so scared
that he passed out.

302
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,960
Don't tease him.

303
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,736
- Wuss.
- It's true though.

304
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,720
Hey!

305
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,160
Is no one going to help me?

306
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,840
Why are you mad at us?
You forgot your own book.

307
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,680
- Right, guys?
- Yeah.

308
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,920
- Shit.
- It's not my fault.

309
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,600
- Why should we help?
- Yeah, why?

310
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,560
Don't blame us.

311
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,560
I'll send it to you if you want.

312
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,720
Shit. Did you resell it?

313
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,600
- You asshole.
- And we have to help him?

314
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,560
- Why should we?
- Why do we have to help?

315
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,440
Can't you just help Auan?

316
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,440
Auan, borrow one from another class
or buy one from the school co-op.

317
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,760
I'll help you.

318
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,760
Damn idiots.

319
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,400
He forgot to bring a book.
It's not like he'll get killed.

320
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,016
- Jeez, Not.
- He's dead.

321
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,480
- Damn, he's so dead.
- No doubt.

322
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,440
Let's go.

323
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,920
- He's just afraid of the teacher.
- Tell him.

324
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
No.

325
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,440
Hey, Tas.

326
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,280
Do you guys have math today?

327
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,160
Today? No.

328
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,760
Thanks anyway.

329
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,680
Auan, go check the school co-op.

330
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,480
I'll ask around for you.

331
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,440
Q.

332
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,400
Listen.

333
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,440
Thank you so much for helping me.

334
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,200
SCHOOL CO-OP

335
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:55,960
It's closed?

336
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,640
- You'll see.
- Sure.

337
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,440
- Hey, Prem.
- Yeah?

338
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,240
Is your math book with you?

339
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,920
I don't have math today.

340
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,440
- And you?
- Me neither.

341
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,320
Open. Come on.

342
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,520
Open.

343
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,680
Tan.

344
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,760
What were you two doing in the infirmary?

345
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,400
Not, this is a school, not a hotel.

346
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:50,040
Only you could come up with
such dirty thoughts.

347
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,440
Do you like Q?

348
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,120
So what if I do? Is it your concern?

349
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,840
You, Tan... you like someone like Q?

350
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,920
That guy...

351
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,880
is just the son of a crooked official

352
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,960
who stole our taxes
to pay his tuition fee.

353
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,240
A guy like him

354
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,320
can only ever be our doormat.

355
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,080
I know

356
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,240
that you think the same thing we do.

357
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,120
And what is that?

358
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,840
You just want to use him.

359
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,840
He's helping Auan find that book...

360
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,840
...but do you think
that Auan would appreciate him?

361
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,400
In the end,

362
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,520
Auan is just using him too.

363
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,400
Hey, Auan, how is it going?

364
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,400
Did you find that book?

365
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,880
No, I didn't.

366
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,000
I tried everything.

367
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,920
Auan, you heard what I just said,
didn't you?

368
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,560
What do you think?

369
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,520
I don't know.

370
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,920
I don't have time to think of anything.

371
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,560
But I know that Q helped me.

372
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,640
You guys didn't.

373
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,720
What the hell?

374
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,360
You forgot your own book.

375
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,600
I'm sure I brought it. I didn't forget it.

376
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,160
It must be you guys.

377
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,120
- What?
- Did anyone see or hide my book?

378
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,040
- Again.
- What the hell?

379
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,960
- He's mad again.
- You forgot the book.

380
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,280
Now you're accusing us of stealing it?

381
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,920
You're fucking selfish.

382
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,480
I'm not accusing anyone.

383
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,240
But I know what you guys are like.

384
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,760
Well, Tan?

385
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,600
I asked you a question.
Aren't you gonna answer it?

386
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,560
What do you want me to say?

387
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,680
It's a silly question.

388
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,280
Do you really like Q?

389
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,440
Did you already screw him?

390
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:31,920
Damn.

391
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,040
Did you screw him?

392
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,400
Answer me.

393
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,400
Answer me.

394
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,240
You screwed him, right?

395
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,480
Why won't you answer me?

396
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Yeah.

397
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,840
I screwed him.

398
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,960
Why should you care?

399
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,920
So when you screwed me,

400
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,440
it was just a hookup?

401
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,920
Yeah, it was just a hookup.

402
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,960
I did it with everybody.

403
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,560
And with Q too.

404
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,560
I was just using him.

405
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,920
I tricked him into falling for me
so that he would help you guys.

406
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,560
Yesterday, I came early
with all the books for every subject.

407
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,760
That's how I saw him
having breakfast at the canteen.

408
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,440
Not, I have to go.

409
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,920
I just saw Q.

410
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,120
Q, ARE YOU OKAY?
AREN'T YOU IN THE GROUP CHAT?

411
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,560
<i>And if I hadn't sent him a message,
you'd all be dead now.</i>

412
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,280
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU

413
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,560
How dare you talk to me like this?

414
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,600
Have you ever thought about my feelings?

415
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,000
Have you ever fucking thought about me?

416
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,560
Fuck you, Vaan. My book is here.

417
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,200
Why did you steal my book?

418
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,360
How do you know it's yours?

419
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,200
Your name isn't on it.

420
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,120
All the books look the same.

421
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,000
Yeah, I didn't write my name on it.

422
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,120
But I drew
the ghost of Room 6/4's teacher in it.

423
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,280
Take a fucking look.

424
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,520
- Look, everyone.
- Damn.

425
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,880
- What a jerk.
- Asshole.

426
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,720
- What now?
- How could you do this?

427
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,320
- You betrayed your friend?
- Jeez.

428
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,280
- Damn.
- How could you do this?

429
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,520
- That's disgusting.
- Auan is his friend too.

430
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,640
- So selfish.
- Where are you going, thief?

431
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,640
I didn't want to steal it.

432
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,200
But it's all because of Q.

433
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,680
He took so long
to say which book to bring.

434
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,880
It was too late for me.

435
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,040
What is it, Dad?

436
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,440
<i>Vaan, why did you leave
your book in my car?</i>

437
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,080
<i>Don't you need it for class?</i>

438
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,160
My book?

439
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,000
Bye, Dad.

440
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,920
MATHEMATICS

441
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,080
<i>Can you bring it to me now? I need it.</i>

442
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,120
<i>If it's so important,
why did you forget it?</i>

443
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,840
<i>- Now you want me to bring it for you?
- </i>Shit. It really isn't here.

444
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,160
<i>Dad, stop complaining.
You've no idea how important it is.</i>

445
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:40,520
<i>- My life depends on it, Dad.
- Vaan, don't use that tone with me.</i>

446
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:45,400
<i>If you behave like this, you have to learn
the consequences of your actions.</i>

447
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,880
<i>If I didn't resort to this,</i>

448
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:52,000
you guys would be treating me
the same way you're treating Auan now.

449
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,960
You could have done it to anyone.

450
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,640
But why me?

451
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,240
I'm your best friend, Vaan.

452
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,400
I'm just trying to survive!

453
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,840
- Vaan, you asshole!
- Hey!

454
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,920
- Hey.
- Hey.

455
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,680
Vaan's a jerk.

456
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,280
I've been doing this
for you guys all along.

457
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,440
You forgot your book,
so you stole someone else's.

458
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,040
And yet you blame me.

459
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,920
But it was all your fault.

460
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,040
And you.

461
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,280
You made it all happen.

462
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,880
What's up with you?

463
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,440
Are you nuts?

464
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,280
Whatever I tell you to do,
just shut up and do it.

465
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,520
No, I won't.

466
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,040
Hey, Vaan!

467
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,880
What the hell?

468
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,520
Help me!

469
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,600
Help me!

470
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,360
Let me go!

00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,160
Did you already screw him?

480
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,160
Did you screw him?

481
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,920
Yeah.

482
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,160
I screwed him.

483
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,800
So when you screwed me,

484
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,360
it was just a hookup?

485
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,880
Yeah.

486
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,680
And with Q too.

487
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,720
I was just using him.
I tricked him into falling for me

488
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,960
<i>so that he would help you guys.</i>

489
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,520
<i>Have you ever thought about my feelings?</i>

490
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,880
<i>Have you ever fucking thought about me?</i>

<i>Thanks, Q.</i>

494
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,800
- EARTH: YOU'RE SO EARLY
- TAE: K THANK

495
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,760
Not.

496
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,120
Not!

497
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,800
Shit!

498
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,480
Who the hell are you?

499
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,160
I'm Wittaya.

500
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:24,920
For me? Why?

501
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,960
Don't you want to know

502
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,920
if the curse of our classroom is real?

503
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Of course I do.

504
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:40,920

Wittaya's book?

507
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,280
Yeah.

508
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:51,080
I know that you can't stand him either.

509
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,920
<i>I mean, yeah.</i>

510
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,480

<i>If you don't like him,</i>

<i>you don't have to care.</i>

513

<i>They say
that at 7:00 a.m. every day,</i>

514
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:31,200
<i>a mysterious message would appear
on the blackboard.</i>

515
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,600
<i>Each day, it would name
a book for a subject.</i>

516
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,560
<i>If any student in the class</i>

the book listed on the board,</i>

518

and be erased from everyone's memory.</i>

the motives behind this mass killing</i>
