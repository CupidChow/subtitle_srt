3
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,280
<i>like the unsolved mystery
of what lies beyond death.</i>

4
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,800
<i>There are ghost stories
everywhere in every school.</i>

5
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,000
<i>They are told during the day</i>

6
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,400
<i>by one student to another,
from generation to generation.</i>

7
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,880
<i>They are told, retold,
twisted, and distorted</i>

8
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,480
<i>until their origins are lost.</i>

9
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,280
<i>Ghost stories are created from the dark,</i>

10
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,840
<i>from the fear rooted deep
in the hearts of students</i>

11
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,120
<i>who imagine the school at night</i>

12
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,840
<i>as a realm where spirits roam.</i>

13
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,040
<i>It's no longer somewhere they belong.</i>

14
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,280
<i>It becomes a place for...</i>

15
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,200
ghosts.

16
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:37,040
Ghosts are created
from humans' unconscious fear of death.

17
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,400
Everyone has a fear of death,

18
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,600
so we created the idea of life after death
to go on existing and to become immortal.

19
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,040
But it's not real.

20
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,440
In modern science,
quantum physicists have stated that

21
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,640
humans are merely made
of particles and energy.

22
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,920
When the brain stops working
and the heart stops beating,

23
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,320
those particles will disappear.

24
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,560
Therefore, life after death,
spirits, and ghosts don't exist.

25
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,840
Statistically, almost 80% of people
who claim to have seen ghosts

26
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,880
are mentally ill.

27
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,400
GHOSTS

28
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,520
We said we'd meet up. Remember?

29
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,160
We did?

30
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,040
You know. Tonight at school.

31
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,160
Boyd, are you serious about this?

32
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,600
Of course. Am I the type to joke around?

33
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,320
Don't say you'll bail on me again.

34
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,400
You made me a promise.

35
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,920
Okay.

36
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
- Fine.
- Great.

37
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,640
What's this clip you sent me?

38
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,640
Fucking hilarious.

39
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,920
<i>Come on, Boyd.
Don't you know the Jinx app?</i>

40
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,520
<i>Most teens are on it.</i>

41
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,040
<i>Oh, and about the students
who believe ghosts cursed them...</i>

42
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,800
What app and what curse?

43
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,240
<i>It's a place to vent,
a bit like Twitter.</i>

44
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,120
<i>Those kids believe ghosts order
the students in class M.6/4</i>

45
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,440
<i>to bring the books listed on the board
to class every day at 7:00 a.m.</i>

46
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,480
<i>If they don't do it, they'll die.</i>

47
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,040
Students still believe that shit?

48
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,600
Old superstitions.

49
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,280
<i>You're the only one trying
so hard to debunk ghosts.</i>

50
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,360
<i>Yeah.</i>

51
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,040
<i>Hey, Boyd. Why hasn't Tum joined us yet?</i>

52
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,560
<i>Right?</i>

53
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,600
You're right.

54
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,920
But I'm meeting him at 10:00 p.m.

55
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,960
to prove that the ghost stories
that we've told at school for years

56
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,720
are all lies.

57
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,720
<i>You're always teasing him.</i>

58
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,640
<i>- He'll piss himself.
- Damn wuss.</i>

59
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,200
<i>- Wow.
- Hey, Boyd.</i>

60
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,200
<i>Don't forget to go live.
We want to see Tum piss himself.</i>

61
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,040
Sure. I'll go live for you guys.

62
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,000
<i>- I can't wait.
- I'll make a meme out of it.</i>

63
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,560
<i>The whole school will see.</i>

64
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,456
<i>- He'll be famous.
- Good idea!</i>

65
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,480
<i>Awesome!</i>

66
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,080

<i>Well, I forgot.</i>

75
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,440
<i>I thought you'd be here.
You said we'd meet at ten, right?</i>

76
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,360
<i>Fine. Wait there. I'm coming.

<i>Boyd, come on in.
I'm already inside.</i>

81
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,920
How the hell did he get in?

82
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,760
Where is he?

83
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,280

- Boo!
- Hey!

87
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,880
Tum, what the hell are you doing in there?

88
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,360
Well, it's scary outside,

89
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,680
with all those ghosts, strangers,

90
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,960
and stray dogs.

91
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,400
When the guard wasn't around, I snuck in.

92
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,520
And then I saw you.

93
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,080
I thought you weren't afraid of ghosts.
That was quite a high-pitched scream.

94
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,000
Anyone would be scared
when you pop out of the dark like that.

95
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,800
Is that the guard?

96
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,760
Hey, get inside and hide.

97
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,800
Let's step back a bit.

98
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,240
Hey. Why are you trying
so hard to disprove ghosts?

99
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,960
People have believed
in ghosts for centuries.

100
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,240
Exactly. It's been centuries,

101
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,800
so I have to convince people like you
to stop believing old superstitions

102
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,240
and live in the present

103
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,920
to make progress in the world.

104
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,040
Hey.

105
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,360
You're too close.

106
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,320
Well, I don't want to get caught.

107
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,880
Whatever.

108
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,720
I think he left.

109
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,920
Let's get out. It's getting cramped.

110
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,840
- Okay.
- Let's go.

111
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,080
- Ouch.
- Go on.

112
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,520
- You go first.
- You can go first.

113
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,600
You go first.

114
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,720
No, you first.

115
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,880
- Together?
- Okay.

116
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,720
Okay. You go first.

117
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,040
- I'll go first.
- Okay.

118
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,600

- What?

119
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,920
Where are we going?

- You take this.
- Huh?

124
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,640
And I'll take this.

125
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,600
There.

126

What is this?

127
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,600
Your job is to show me the way.

128
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,080

00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,680
<i>is impossible.</i>

319
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,320
<i>Before the practice session,</i>

320
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,680
<i>the space would be cleared first,</i>

321
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,280
<i>by either the coaches or the gymnasts.</i>

322
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:38,640
<i>Everyone practices on the beam
before solo practice, so they'd see it.</i>

323
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,800
JAMES: YES, GO ON

324
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,720
<i>All right? And the sound everyone hears,</i>

325
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,400
<i>whether it's the sound
of someone running or practicing,</i>

326
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:53,840
<i>when the guards and the students come
in here to check, they see nothing at all.</i>

327
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,480
TIME: SHUT UP, SKEPTIC

328
00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:00,280
<i>The truth is, the sound
that everyone hears comes from the wood</i>

329
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,760
<i>that gets swollen because of the humidity.</i>

330
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,880
Therefore, although it sounds
like someone running or practicing,

331
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,880
it's not real.

332
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,920
BEM: SO SCIENTIFIC

333
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,720
<i>In short, this ghost story is</i>

334
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,720
<i>just another lie.</i>

335
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,560
Believe me now?

336
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,640
Yeah.

337
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,200
<i>Even Tum believes me now.</i>

338
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,320
LOL9: YOU GOTTA SEE THE REAL SHIT

339
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,200
We'll take you guys on a tour
around the school one more time.

340
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Let's go, Tum.

341
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,600
- For real?
- Let's go. Yeah, for real.

342
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,240
Damn it.

343
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,640
Come on. Let's go.

344
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:05,640
FIRE ESCAPE

345
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,360
Tum.

346
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,560
What?

347
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,400
Not so scared now, huh?
Leading the way, I see.

348
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,520
Do you believe me now
when I say that ghosts don't exist?

349
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,080
Have you seen any
since we started walking around here?

350
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,440
Hey, Boyd.

351
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,520
What?

352
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,520
Will you tell the other one?

353
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,440
They all talk about it.

354
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,360
I know every ghost story
in this school without exception.

355
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,840
I guess you're not
the expert that you claim to be.

356
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,520
What don't I know?

357
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,320
Hey, it's not a big deal.

358
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,280
- Why are you mad?
- I'm not mad.

359
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,200
I just wanna know.
What is it that you know that I don't?

360
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,840
Or are you just making it up to bluff me?

361
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,720
Well, it's the story
people are talking about.

362
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,720
They're talking about it? Okay.

363
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,920
So tell me.

364
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,480
What is this story
people are talking about?

365
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,960
Go on. Our friends are waiting.

366
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,680
Story number three.

367
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,080
Once, there were two best friends

368
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,680
who went to debunk
the school's ghost stories.

369
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,080
When the two of them
went to the last haunted spot,

370
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,840
which was the school's top floor
that was closed down,

371
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,400
they decided to play a game at that place.

372
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:01,280
The one who came up with the mission
told the other to pick heads or tails.

373
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,840
And the winner could order the loser

374
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,800
to do anything.

375
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,000
This is not a real story.

376
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,160
I know all this school's ghost stories.
Don't make stuff up, Tum.

377
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,000
I'm not making it up.

378
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,800
I heard it from someone else.

379
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,800
Who?

380
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,520
The one who told you.

381
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,600
Who was it?

382
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,240
Tell me, then.

383
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,280
Well... I... I don't know.

384
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,440
If you don't know...

385
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,400
then just shut up.

386
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,240
Let's say that today's mission

387
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,720
has been completed.

388
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,120
The two of us found nothing here.

389
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,520
Not even a single ghost.

390
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,600
And Tum already admitted
that ghosts aren't real.

391
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,760
Catch you guys later.

392
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,440
Come on, Tum. Let's go home.

393
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,600
Hey, Boyd.

394
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,680
How can you be sure

395
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,480
that ghosts aren't real?

396
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,920
Well, do you see any?

397
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,560
They're real.

398
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,720
We just didn't see.

399
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,080
Who's pulling this prank?

400
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,880
Traditional Thai music
and traditional dancers?

401
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,480
Clichés can't scare me.

402
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,360
Boyd.

403
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,480
Stop saying stuff
that you don't know for sure.

404
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,400
Well, I'm not scared!

405
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,600
Unlike you who's scared of everything.

406
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,080
Did you plot this prank
with the others behind my back?

407
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,640
If you're scared,

408
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,600
then stay here.

409
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,760
I'll go by myself.

410
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,600
Boyd.

411
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,240
Who the hell are you guys?

412
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,560
Boyd! Boyd, get back here!

413
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,080
Shit!

414
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,960
Boyd, run!

415
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,800
Hurry!

416
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,400
Be honest.

417
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,360
You guys pranked me, right?

418
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,800
Who would prank you?

419
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,520
I should be asking you.

420
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,920
Did you guys plan to prank me?

421
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,520
If I did try to prank you,

422
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,840
do you think the others would join me?

423
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,240
They are your friends.

424
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,360
And if I were not your friend,

425
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,360
they wouldn't care about me

426
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,480
or even be my friends.

427
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,480
I'm not buying it.

428
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,280
There's no way
the ghosts we just saw are real.

429
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,280
I bet they knew
I brought you to debunk ghost stories,

430
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,520
so they pranked us both.

431
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,680
Hide over there!

432
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,760
Hurry!

433
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,320
You said the stories weren't true.

434
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,560
This is just like the story we told.

435
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,920
Well,

436
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I think

437
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,160
we should run.

438
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,920
Come on.

439
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,960
Boyd!

440
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,960
Boyd, hurry up!

441
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,640
Hurry up, Tum! Keep running.

442
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,240
- No!
- Hey!

443
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,440
- Let's find another way.
- Yeah, let's go.

444
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,056
- Hey, Boyd!
- Tum.

445
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,520
A way out!

446
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,080
- Hurry.
- Okay.

447
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,200
Hurry up, Tum!

448
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,040
Boyd. Upstairs. Hurry!

449
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,760
- Upstairs, Tum.
- Yeah.

450
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,480
Shit.

451
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,200
Hey.

452
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,520
Hey.

453
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,640
Tum.

454
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,160
Boyd!

455
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,000
Hey. That way.

456
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,080
Yeah.

457
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,400
- Tum.
- Huh?

458
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,640
- Tum!
- What?

459
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,880
I think

460
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,800
we should go downstairs.

461
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,000
There may be another exit.

462
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,800
The ghosts are downstairs.

463
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,400
Wouldn't it be better to go up?

464
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,640
I'm not going.

465
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,000
I don't trust what's behind that.

466
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,400
Let's make a bet.

467
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,720
I'll flip a coin.

468
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,400
If you win,

469
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,600
we go down.

470
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,960
But if I win,

471
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,880
we go up together.

472
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,040
Stop messing around.

473
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,480
Now's not the time.

474
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,560
Right. We don't have time,

475
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,560
so I'm making you choose.

476
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,840
If you don't choose,

477
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,320
I'll choose first.

478
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,680
The side of the coin that I didn't pick

479
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
is yours.

480
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,800
And if I lose...

481
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,080
I'll do what you say.

482
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,240
No way.

483
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,320
I call heads,

484
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,840
so you're tails.

485
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,480
Wait!

486
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,640
Heads.

487
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,200
I win.

488
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,000
This time, we both go up.

489
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,200
Or do you want me to go first,

490
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,200
so you can leave me again?

491
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,640
Boyd!

492
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,080
Wait for me.

493
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,240
Boyd, where are you taking me?

494
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,960
The door's closed.

495
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,600
Fine. You're right.

496
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,960
Ghosts aren't real.

497
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,360
Let's just do this

498
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,600
so we can go home.

499
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,520
In that case,

500
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,720
let's flip a coin.

501
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,600
The loser does what the winner says.

502
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,120
I call tails. You're heads, okay?

503
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,760
Tails.

504
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,840
I win.

505
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,960
You go first.

506
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,800
After the winner

507
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,280
told the loser

508
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,520
to open the door

509
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,080
to take a look and see

510
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,440
if there were ghosts behind it,

511
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,400
the loser

512
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,720
had to comply.

513
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,680
But what he saw

514
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,280
made him cry out to his friend for help.

515
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,280
Shit! Help me!

516
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,640
- Boyd, help me!
- Shit.

517
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,840
He couldn't leave.

518
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,960
- Earth!
- Boyd!

519
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,280
Help me! Boyd, help me! Boyd!

520
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,400
The winner

521
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,120
heard his friend crying for help

522
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,200
and got scared.

523
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:29,080
He left him to face
what was behind that door alone.

524
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:35,440
After that, the abandoned friend
never came back to school again.

525
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,240
And the one who got away

526
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,320
resumed his normal life at school.

527
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,720
Remember what I said at the gym?

528
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,680
Just because you can't see it,

529
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,160
that doesn't mean it's not real.

530
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,800
You're just trying to turn a blind eye,

531
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:04,520
so you tried to find
every theory to debunk this kind of belief

532
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,400
just so you can move on with your life,

533
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,920
clinging to your own beliefs.

534
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,680
But deep down, you know...

535
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,000
those things are real.

536
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,760
Hey, someone's calling.

537
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,760
Pick it up.

538
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,440
<i>Boyd.</i>

539
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,760
<i>Why didn't you take my calls?</i>

540
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,520
<i>I've called you so many times.</i>

541
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,880
<i>Are you with Tum now?</i>

542
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,120
Yeah.

543
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,960
He's right in front of me.

544
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:08,080
<i>I have something to tell you.</i>

545
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,880
<i>Look at the group chat right now.</i>

546
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:10,960
<i>That's all I'll say.</i>

547
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,920
TUM HAD AN ACCIDENT ON THE WAY TO SCHOOL

548
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Shit.

549
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:42,480
<i>Today, Tum and I will take
you guys with us to prove</i>

550
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,760
<i>that those old tales</i>

551
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,400
<i>are all lies.</i>

552
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:47,840
<i>Ready, Tum?</i>

553
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:48,840
PIMRY: CAREFUL

554
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:49,920
<i>Yeah, he's ready.</i>

555
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,520
BOATSEED CALLING

556
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,720
MEBBAITOEY: READ THE GROUP CHAT

557
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,000
<i>Why are you calling?</i>

558
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,320
MING ISSMINK CALLING

559
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,040
<i>Guys, stop calling me. I'm going live now.</i>

560
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,200
MING ISSMINK: RUN

561
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,240
And stop sending me
this alien gibberish. I can't read it.

562
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,920
<i>Type something I can read.</i>

563
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,440
- PIMRY: YEAH, DON'T KILL THE VIBE
- BOATSEED: STOP IT NOW

564
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,200
<i>Tell me if you see anything.</i>

565
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:39,640
Boyd.

566
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,040
This time, you lose.

567
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,240
Will you leave me again?

568
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,280
Hey, Boyd.

569
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,520
What?

570
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,200
We're about to graduate.

571
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,600
But I still wanna hang with you.

572
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:47,640
You're such a baby.

573
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,440
Well, I don't know

574
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:54,760
if we'll still be friends in the future.

575
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:57,640
Sure we will.

576
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:01,200
You're the only best friend I have.

577
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:20,840
I...

578
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,800
I will never leave you.

579
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:58,920
<i>It is said</i>

580
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,680
<i>that every school has a story.</i>
