00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,680
I said no. Hey!

165
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,080
- Get up, asshole.
- What are you doing? Let go of me!

166
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,880
- Come on.
- Let go!

167
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,240
Sit still.

168
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,080
- Let go. Let go of me, Bom! Let go!
- Hey.

169
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,240
Let go! I said, let go.

170
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,080
Let go. Let me go!

171
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,120
Let go! I said, let go.

172
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,120
- Just sit still.
- Let go of me!

173
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,920
- Let go.
- Don't be so loud.

174
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,840
- Hey, shut up.
- I gotta take my exams. Let go!

175
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,080
I'm begging you, A.
Please let me go.

176
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,640
Sure, buddy.

177
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,160
- One sec.
- Let me go!

178
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,040
- Hold him still.
- Hold him.

179
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,800
- Let go!
- Stay still.

180
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,160
Let go of me!

181
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,680
Why are you tying me up?

182
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,880
I said, let go of me. Come on.

183
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,440
Let me go! Let go! Let go!

184
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,320
Hey, Korn.

185
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,480
You are going to wait here.

186
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,680
Wait for the school nurse ghost to come,

187
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,600
and wish for us
to pass all the exams, okay?

188
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,160
You dragged me all the way here
just for this nonsense?

189
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,360
Stop complaining.

190
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,600
You idiots.

191
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,320
- Hey.
- How can a ghost help you?

192
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,320
Let me go.

193
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,960
A,

194
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,720
we should go. We'll be late for the exam.

195
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,040
- Aren't you gonna wait and see?
- No way. Let's go!

196
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,680
Hey, Korn,

197
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,480
listen carefully.

198
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,080
If the nurse ghost doesn't show up,

199
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,560
you won't take the exam.

200
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,800
And if we fail,

201
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,600
you're dead meat.

202
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,760
Hey.

203
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,400
Where are you going?

204
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,960
A, where are you going?

205
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,800
- Oh.
- Let me go. A.

206
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,080
A! Let me go!

207
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,600
- You're all set.
- I said, let me go!

208
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,440
Let me go!

209
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,000
A!

210
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,600
- Bye-bye.
- Let me go!

211
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,960
Help!

212
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,400
Let me go.

213
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,360
KUNAKORN SCHOOL

214
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,680
CONGRATULATIONS

215
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,520
- Under-eye bags?
- Do the lips.

216
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,400
Wait. Add this first.

217
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,960
- What is that?
- Nose hair.

218
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,680
- What the hell is that?
- Aw.

219
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,040
What are you doing? Well?

220
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,480
Aekachai, Burin, and Mintra.

221
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,120
Yesterday, I was told

222
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,400
that you three threatened someone
so they'd let you copy their answers,

223
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,200
but they refused, and you beat them up.

224
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,400
Is that true? Well?

225
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,840
We already had a meeting
with your parents once, remember?

226
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,920
Hmm.

227
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,040
Who snitched, sir?

228
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,080
You don't need to know.

229
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,160
Was it Korn?

230
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,600
It must have been him.

231
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,640
That asshole.

232
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,240
Hey. Stop it, Burin.

233
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,680
Don't believe him, sir.
Korn's such a liar.

234
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,720
No one wants to be his friend.

235
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,560
That's enough.

236
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,720
Considering what you did yesterday,

237
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,080
if you fail today's exams too,

238
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,360
I will need to speak to your parents again

239
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:33,320
to let them know
that you must repeat this year level.

240
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,120
Understood?

241
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,200
Listen, you three.

242
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,680
If I don't see all of you
at the exam room before eight o'clock,

243
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,680
you can't take the exams.

244
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,400
Sir.

245
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,480
Shit.

246
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,080
If my dad gets a call again,
he won't let me stay in school anymore.

247
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,600
Same here.

248
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,040
My mom said she'd buy me a car
when I graduate.

249
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,960
If I don't graduate,

250
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,800
what am I gonna do?

251
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,440
If I have to repeat,
my dad will beat the shit out of me.

252
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,280
It's that prick's fault.

253
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,320
That bastard, Korn.

254
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,080
<i>Attention, please.</i>

255
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,760
<i>The midterm exams start at 8:30 a.m.</i>

256
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,160
<i>All students, please go to your exam rooms</i>

257
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,680
<i>and proceed with the exams with decorum.</i>

258
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,680
- A and Bom.
- What?

259
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,800
How do we know Korn made a wish for us?

260
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,400
The exams are starting.

261
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,040
I told you, Mint.
We should have waited there.

262
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,960
- Why did you leave so fast?
- Well, I was scared, of course.

263
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,960
I'm sure he made a wish for us, Mint.
He wouldn't dare defy us.

264
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,840
I know, but I can't be sure.
How do we know if the wish came true?

265
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,680
A.

266
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,720
What?

267
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,240
Should we go back and check on him?

268
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,760
Seriously, Mint?

269
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,040
The exam is about to start.

270
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,960
Jeez. Just take the exam first.

271
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,800
If we happen to fail...

272
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,360
Bom and I will beat him up. Okay?

273
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,680
Why are you yelling at me?
Is this my fault?

274
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,520
Fine. I'm sorry.

275
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,400
- Is that good enough?
- Shit.

276
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,880
I'm stressed out. I'm going for a smoke.

277
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,080
Hey, Bom.

278
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,920
- I'm coming with you.
- Don't go, A.

279
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,760
I told you, I'm scared. Stay here with me.

280
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,560
Sit down.

281
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,680
Sit.

282
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,680
Sit.

283
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,800
DANGER! KEEP OUT

284
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Let me go.

285
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:28,400
Don't try to scare me, A, Bom, and Mint.

286
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,640
<i>Won't you make a wish?</i>

287
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,520
What the hell?

288
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,680
I'm not scared.

289
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,720
Don't try to scare me.

290
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,160
Show your face if you dare.

291
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,040
<i>Aren't you going to make a wish?</i>

292
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,800
Hey.

293
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,640
You can't scare me, Mint.

294
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,240
Your stupid tricks
only work on little kids.

295
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,800
You won't make a wish?

296
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,560
DANGER, UNDER RENOVATION

297
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,560
We're screwed.

298
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,600
Damn, it's Korn.
Mint, Korn's back. Let's go!

299
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,840
Where are you going? Hey, Korn. Don't run.

300
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,840
Where are you going, buddy?

301
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,400
Where are you going, huh?

302
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,560
Did you make a wish for us?

303
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,280
You made a wish for us, right?

304
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,320
Answer me!

305
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,680
Hey, Korn,
did you ask that damn ghost for a wish?

306
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,240
You did, right?

307
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,440
Yeah, I made a wish for you.

308
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,440
You idiots.

309
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,560
Sir!
There's a dead body behind the gym!

310
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,000
Sir! It's Bom.

311
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,000
Bom from Room Two died behind the gym!

312
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,200
There's blood everywhere. Sir!

313
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,920
Shit. Bom.

314
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
The legend...

315
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,120
the legend is true, Mint.

316
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,040
My wish,

317
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,280
it came true, Mint.

318
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,640
Korn, you bastard!

319
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,400
- What wish?
- What did you wish for?

320
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,680
What did you say?

321
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,600
What was your wish?
What did you ask for? Answer me!

322
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,080
KORN IS A SISSY LOL

323
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,080
KORN, YOU IDIOT

324
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,560
Damn it!

325
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,480
Stop it!

326
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,120
Fuck!

327
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,800
Fuck!

328
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,520
Fuck!

329
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,080
Tell me your wish.

330
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,160
Fine!

331
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,880
I made a wish for you.

332
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,160
You won't make a wish?

333
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,760
Fine. I'll make a wish.

334
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,800
A, Bom, and Mint.
I wish all three of them would die!

335
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,600
I wished for all three of you

336
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,120
to die!

337
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,560
You all can die!

338
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,080
Remember this.

339
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,680
You all will pay the price.

340
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,320
Why the fuck did you wish for that?
How could you do this?

341
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,200
You wished for us to die?

342
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,200
Shit.

343
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,640
Shit. What the hell?

344
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,040
Yeah.

345
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,160
I wished that the three of you

346
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,160
would all die.

347
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,800
A, Mint, and Bom.

348
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,880
All of you can die.

349
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,720
A!

350
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,520
All three of you can die.

351
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,440
- All of you can die.
- A!

352
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,760
A, get back here.

353
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,120
A.

354
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,120
A, is that the wheelchair
from the old infirmary?

355
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,760
Shit!

356
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,600
Hey.

357
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,280
Mint, you bitch!

358
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,040
- Hurry.
- Hey, what is it? Hey, what happened?

359
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,720
Attention, please.

360
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,720
The exams for all classes
and year levels are postponed.

361
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:02,880
<i>All teachers, please inform
and advise your students to go home.</i>

362
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,240
Hurry up, kids.
Get yourselves home.

363
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:09,040
<i>- Wait at home for further announcements.
- </i>Hurry up. Go home now.

364
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:14,400
<i>- Avoid the scenes of the incidents.</i>
- Go get your bags and go home. Hurry up.

365
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,920
- Hey, a Room Four kid died on the stairs.
<i>- Do not take photos or videos.</i>

366
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,000
<i>- Don't spread any unconfirmed information.</i>
- Scary. I bet that's why we're going home.

367
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,760
Really?

368
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,360
- I've no idea.
- The teacher's here. Guys, let's go.

369
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,840
- Hey.
- Let's go and see.

370
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,280
<i>...according to the school
code of conduct.</i>

371
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,800
Please pay attention, students.

372
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,640
Today, the school has decided
to postpone the final exams.

373
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,400
Sir, did someone really die
behind the building?

374
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,120
Sir, the body on the staircase,
is it A's body?

375
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,160
Sir, my friend said someone died
in front of the old building.

376
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,560
Is she really one of our senior students?

377
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,560
- Is it true, sir?
- Is it true, sir?

378
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,800
Please tell us, sir.

379
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,920
That's enough. Enough for now.
Please remain calm, everyone.

380
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:11,000
For now, I'd like you to call your parents
and have them pick you up soon.

381
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,440
Go and wait at home
for announcements from the school.

382
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,520
- What?
- All right. That's it.

383
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,640
- Sir.
- What the hell?

384
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,800
What the hell was that?

385
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,360
- What?
- What do you think?

386
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,200
I guess we'll go home.

387
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,640
Hey.

388
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,360
You made the ball wet.
Watch where you're going.

389
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,480
Are you stupid?
Standing here drinking?

390
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,160
Damn, our ball is all wet now.

391
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,280
Hey, you're the ones who threw it at me.

392
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,400
Well, you weren't paying attention.

393
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,440
- Wipe it with your shirt.
- Take it off.

394
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,880
- Hey.
- Just take it off.

395
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,560
Get off me.

396
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,200
Get off. I said, get off.
Hey, get off me. Get off!

397
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,000
- What the hell?
- Hey!

398
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,760
You. And you.

399
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,440
You wanna end up like A?

400
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,640
What are you talking about?

401
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,400
Are you joking about the dead?

402
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:14,400
Yeah. You always talk shit like this.
That's why nobody wants to help you.

403
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,200
Fine! I don't want your help anyway!

404
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,800
- You assholes!
- Hey. Why would you say that?

405
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,080
- How dare you?
- You're the asshole!

406
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,000
Yeah.

407
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,280
- Idiot.
- Fine!

408
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,560
Mark my words.

409
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,520
I'll get back at all of you.
Just you wait!

410
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,560
I'll get you, assholes. Damn.

411
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,680
I'll get you, bastards.

412
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:22,880
You got it, assholes.

413
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,560
I'll get back at you.

414
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,440
I'll get back at all of you.

415
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,920
Just wait, assholes.

416
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,680
Jack, Mor, Kong,

417
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:47,880
Guide, Por, Tong, Game,
White, Lee, and Champ.

418
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,640
Did A and his friends die today

419
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,360
because of my wish?

420
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,040
Yes.

421
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,600
Then I want to make another wish.

422
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,120
All the people who bullied me,

423
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,920
I want them to die.

424
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,160
Of course.

425
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,640
But last time,

426
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,160
I didn't get anything in exchange

427
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,640
for your wish.

428
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,680
Well,

429
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,280
what... what do you want?

430
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,240
You ask for death,

431
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,360
you pay with a piece of a living soul.

432
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,400
What... What do you mean?

433
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,760
One dead body

434
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,720
in exchange for one body part.

435
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,440
These are

436
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,520
for the three bodies earlier.

437
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,840
And...

438
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,880
...as for your new wish...

439
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,720
about all your bullies,

440
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,080
there are

441
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,400
33 of them.

442
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:27,000
I don't want it anymore.
No more. I don't want it.

443
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,920
I take it back. Wait!

444
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,200
I take it back! I take it back!

445
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,600
Help! Help me!

446
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,840
What an idiot.

447
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,680
If he really does comes back,

448
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,400
you're the one who's gonna get beaten up.

449
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,400
Fuck off.

450
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,680
Hey, I'm just warning you nicely.

451
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,560
Wanna fight me?

452
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,560
You're so rude, Korn.

453
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,640
That's why no one helps you
when you get beaten up.

454
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,400
Help me! Somebody help me!

455
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:55,440
I don't want it anymore. Help me!

456
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,520
- What's up, Korn?
- You'd better shower!

457
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,600
Hey.

458
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,800
I take it back!

459
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,240
<i>Don't believe him, sir.
Korn's such a liar.</i>

460
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,160
- I take it back!
<i>- He's so rude.</i>

461
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,920
<i>And he always swears at other people.</i>

462
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,800
I don't want it anymore.

463
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,520
Shit. Stop it.

464
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,360
- You stink. Let me wash you.
- Stop. I told you to stop.

465
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,120
- Stop it! No!
<i>- He thinks he's smarter than us.</i>

466
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,120
<i>He's a school representative,</i>

467
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,920
so he thinks he can call anyone stupid.

468
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,080
You're all stupid.

469
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,800
Just quit school.

470
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,520
Idiots.

471
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,800
All brawn and no brains.

472
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,360
Damn it!

473
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,440
I take it back.

474
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,000
Please help me.

475
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,360
You want me to kick you first?

476
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,480
Help me! Help me!

477
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:03,400
<i>So you found your bag, did you?
Why is your stuff all wet like that,</i>

478
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,600
<i>Korn, you idiot?</i>

479
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,560
<i>Help me.</i>

480
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,360
<i>I can't take it anymore.
I don't want this.</i>

481
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,240
No more.

482
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,800
Don't worry.

483
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:06,240
I won't let you rot to death
before I grant you 33 bodies for sure.

484
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:22,520
No! No! No!

485
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,080
Hey, do you think
the legend of this place is true?

486
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,120
Of course. It's quite scandalous.

487
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,400
They say if you sit on the wheelchair

488
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,200
and turn your back to the door,
the school nurse ghost will appear.

489
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,400
What?

490
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:29,120
So where's the wheelchair?

491
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,200
Hmm... You're right.

492
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,240
There it is.

493
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,000
- Go take it.
- Yeah.

494
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,640
Be careful.

495
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,840
- Bring it here.
- Come on.

496
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,880
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

497
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,600
Well, what do we do next?

498
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,840
You just sit in it

499
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:02,320
and turn your back towards the door,
then the school nurse ghost should appear.

500
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,120
- Okay. Make a wish, then.
- Okay.

501
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,400
How was it?

502
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,560
What did you wish for?

503
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,680
I'm not gonna tell you.
Wanna try?

504
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,840
Yeah, sure.
