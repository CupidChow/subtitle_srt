<i>...to amazing.</i>

17
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,760
<i>Here's the story.</i>

18
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,320
<i>This lady used to serve
rice with soups and curries.</i>

19
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,480
When she switched to serving
spicy pork bone soup, bam,

20
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,640
things got better for her.

21
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,640
Mmm, it really is good.

22
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,560
- DONUTS: HAHA, HE SLURPED
- LNWNAJA: IS IT THAT GOOD, KONG?

00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,640
AUMNAJ JJ: I'VE EATEN THERE. IT'S SO GOOD

24
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,800
<i>Her food stall has no name.</i>

25
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,760
YO SASICHA: EPIC

26
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,600
<i>But the whole school calls it
"Aunty Jong's place."</i>

27
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,280
Let me tell you something.
The most important point here

28
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,160
is that

29
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,680
the son of the stall owner

30
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,120
is a drug dealer.

31
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,280
In our school,
the drugs that Jong's son sells the most

32
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,880
are probably amphetamine and weed.

33
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,480
He comes after school.

34
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,480
He and I usually meet behind the toilets.

35
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,760
Aunty Jong knows all about it.

36
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,920
Remember, she may look like a nice person,

37
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,880
but looks are deceiving.

38
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,160
It's possible

39
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,520
that she put weed

40
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,040
in her soup.

41
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,720
You know, I'm not sure.

42
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,080
I've eaten some,
and I thought it was good.

43
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,200
I liked it.

44
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,440
I don't know.

45
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:54,000
But I think other stuff must be in there.
That's why it tastes this good.

46
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,400
Shit.

47
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,640
There's other stuff?

48
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,400
Of course there is, dumbass.

49
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,560

Aunty Jong is fucking done for.

140
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,920
Where did she get dogs and cats to cook?

141
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,760
So many still live behind the building.

142
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,680
Right.

143
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,720
But I think the point is not
where she got dogs and cats from.

144
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,480
The question is, how long has she fed us
fucking dogs and cats?

145
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,400
Ew.

146

Shit.

148
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,840
So where is the skull we found?

149
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,840
I heard the school director had Mr. Pob,
the science teacher, take it away

150
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,840
in case it can be used to prove
that Aunty Jong fed dog meat to students.

151
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,440
Shit, I think this is a good thing.

152
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,440
- If it had gone on any longer...
- Who knows?

153
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,400
You and the whole school could end up
barking like damn dogs.

154
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,320
We ate dogs.

155
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,320

156

Kong, you're the hero of the hour.

Well, then,

can I have a cigarette, Mr. Hero?

160
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,120
It hurts! I'm hurt!

161
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,320
- What hurts?

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,600
Look. The urn is right here.

318
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,720
Open your fucking eyes, won't you?

319
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,200
Can't you see?
His mom has worn black for weeks.

320
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,760
I'll tell you something.

321
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,560
Her son was decapitated.

322
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,720
His head still hasn't been found.

323
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,720
Can you imagine?

324
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,720
A mother had to cremate her own son
whose body was missing its head.

325
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,080
How much pain must she have endured?

326
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,920
And you keep harassing her.

327
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,520
You little shit!

328
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,680
What are you waiting for?
Get the hell out!

329
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,560
Go and apologize to Jong right now.

330
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,216
- I can get out myself!
- Go!

331
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,960
- All right!
- Get out!

332
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,880
Get outta here, you punks!

333
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,896
- I can fucking walk myself.
- So damn nosy!

334
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,760
Last time, he barged in and hurt her.

335
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,480
Here he goes again.
Who the hell does he think he is?

336
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,640
Yeah, he's such a clout chaser.

337
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,640
Hey, go and apologize to her right now!

338
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,200
Why should I?

339
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,240
I did nothing wrong.
She really made food with dog meat.

340
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,520
If I hadn't exposed her,

341
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,920
we'd all still be eating dogs.

342
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,960
She didn't cook dogs
or cats or anything like that.

343
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,000
There's only one way to go in and out.

344
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,680
We stall workers here can see

345
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,960
that she buys food
from the market every day.

346
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,560
You're just spewing nonsense, you punk.

347
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,640
Go!

348
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,720
But the other day, everyone here saw it.

349
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,160
That really was a dog's skull in the soup.

350
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,680
Right?

351
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,160
That's enough, Kong.

352
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,800
What you found,
which you claim is a dog's skull,

353
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,560
actually came from a chicken.

354
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,960
I had the so-called skull
tested at the university's lab.

355
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,000
They said the bones look similar.

356
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,480
You have to look closely
to see the differences.```

357
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,160
Mr. Pob, listen to me.

358
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,280
You see,

359
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:51,360
someone said that they saw Aunty Jong
put a dog in a sack and hit it.

360
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,200
I'm telling the truth.

361
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,400
Can you bring that person here
to confirm this story?

362
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,440
It's someone on the Internet.

363
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,760
You can read the comments.
Everyone is talking about this.

364
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,800
Sir, I'm not lying.

365
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,200
Kong.

366
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,320
It's the Internet.

367
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,440
That person may not even be real.

368
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,920
Apologize to Aunty Jong now,

369
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,880
then see the principal.

370
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,680
I won't apologize to her.

371
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,440
I did nothing wrong.

372
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,960
Aunty Jong really cooked dog meat
for all the kids here.

373
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,240
I'm trying to help everyone.

374
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,240
I knew it. She's a good person.

375
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,400
She wouldn't do that.

376
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,640
So true.
Besides, she's so old.

377
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,680
She's too slow to catch dogs or cats.

378
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:49,080
Well, how do you explain
why her cooking suddenly tasted better?

379
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,840
- Enough.
- She put something in it.

380
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,800
That's enough, Kong.

381
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,360
Apologize to Aunty Jong,
then we'll go to the principal's office.

382
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,000
Hey, Mr. Pob, let me go.

383
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,280
I won't apologize.

384
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,880
There must be something, sir. Let me go.

385
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,080
- NOK: AUNTY, DON'T
- NUTTAWUT: BARF

386
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,920
AA: MOVE THE CAMERA

387
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,560
- JOY: WTF, KONG?
- NOENINE: THE TABLES HAVE TURNED

388
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,680
Is this what you want?

389
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,920
<i>I saved you all from eating dogs, right?
And you're doing this to me?</i>

390
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,800
Kong!

391
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,720
- Come back!
- Wait.

392
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,280
What? Let me go!

393
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,480
Hey, wait!

394
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,560
- Hey.
- Hey.

395
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,520
How did it go, Kong?
What's your punishment?

396
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,040
- A parent meeting, dickhead.
- Damn.

397
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,520
And I gotta apologize to that bitch
at the assembly tomorrow

398
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,320
so that she won't press charges,
or I could go to jail.

399
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,960
Shit, man, I'm so fucking mad about this.

400
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,640
You know, right,
that I did this for everyone?

401
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,920
I think you should apologize to Aunty Jong
and end this.

402
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,240
Why should I? I did nothing wrong.

403
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,520
You're one of them now?

404
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,200
It's okay.

405
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:34,320
Today, on Clubhouse,
I'll keep exposing her dirty secrets.

406
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,400
She'll be ruined.

407
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,400
Damn, Kong. What fucking Clubhouse?

408
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,200
They've canceled it.

409
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,000
And now

410
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,680
they've set up a room to bash you,
you know that?

411
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,920
"What an epic fail."

412
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,120
"I knew it."

413
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,440
"Something felt off."

414
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,360
"Just another clout chaser."

415
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,520
"For all we know,

416
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,480
he could be the one
who put the bones in the pot

417
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,840
and made shit up."

418
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,360
- Shit.
- Shit.

419
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,560
Shit, those fucking assholes...

420
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,120
This morning, they supported me.
You saw that, right?

421
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,160
And now they've switched to bashing me?

422
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,240
Fuck them. And...

423
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,520
I'll expose all those trolls on my page.

424
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,480
And you guys have to help me, okay?

425
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,160
You'd better apologize to Aunty Jong
and end this.

426
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:32,280
You'd better apologize via livestream
before you get witch-hunted for real.

427
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,200
That's true. I agree with him, dude.

428
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,000
Why the fuck should I?
I did nothing wrong.

429
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,440
Look, I'll show you how it's done.

430
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,600
I'm so sorry.

431
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,520
I didn't know what I was doing.

432
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,040
I didn't mean it.

433
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,800
- See? You can cry too.
- It's not funny, assholes.

434
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,680
Do you see me laughing?

435
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,400
Fine.

436
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,080
I'm gonna find proof

437
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,480
that the old bitch put
some shit in the soup.

438
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,200
I'll... I'll fucking destroy her.

439
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,200
Will you really do that?

440
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,040
If you do that,

441
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,720
I, for one, won't be a part of it.

442
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,520
You're on your own.

443
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,640
What?

444
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,360
You asshole. Jod, seriously, are you...

445
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,120
are you ditching me?

446
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,880
Honestly, Kong,

447
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,320
you're just...

448
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,720
...using social media to bully people.

449
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,040
If you still can't see it,
that's your problem.

450
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,120
I'm done with you.

451
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,136
- Let's go, Song.
- Okay.

452
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,920
You guys are fucking...

453
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,000
Fucking what?

454
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,400
You're fucking assholes!

455
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,000
Fuck you. How could you say that?

456
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,840
Are we still friends? Well?

457
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,840
Break them up!
What are you waiting for?

458
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,280
- How could you say that?
- That's enough.

459
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,360
- How could you say shit like that?
- I told you to stop!

460
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,720
- Are you all right?
- Hey!

461
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,256
- Calm down!
- What?

462
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,800
Calm the fuck down!

463
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,240
Hey! Enough, okay, guys?

464
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,840
Use your head.

465
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:25,000
You were filming for me this morning.
How can you say that, Jod?

466
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,520
Let's just fucking go.

467
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,240
Is this what friends do?

468
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,000
He's fucking annoying.

469
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,240
Okay, assholes, fuck off, then!
I'll be fine by myself!

470
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,680
I don't need shitty friends like you!

471
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,720
Piece of shit.

472
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,376
- Really?
- How can she do that?

473
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,520
You're gonna get it.
You're done. Take photos.

474
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,320
What the hell?

475
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,640
How long have you fed us dogs' heads?

476
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,640
1] How could she do this?

477
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,200
Shit.

478
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,880
Damn dogs' heads.

479
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,960
Aunty,
how the fuck could you do this?

480
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,880
Jong's son died over a month ago.

481
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,360
Can't you see?
His mom has worn black for weeks.

482
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,200
<i>Enough, Kong.</i>

483
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,400
Apologize to Aunty Jong now.

484
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I won't apologize.

485
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,600
There must be something, sir. Let me go.

486
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,880
Last time,
he barged in and hurt her.

487
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,640
Here he goes again.
Who the hell does he think he is?

488
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,720
Yeah,
he's such a clout chaser.

489
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,360
You'd better apologize to Aunty Jong
and end this.

490
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,720
Hello, I'm Kong,
or Click, the Hardcore Truth-seeker.

491
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,880
- Hello.
<i>- Hey, Kong.</i>

492
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,520
<i>Check your Facebook right now.</i>

493
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,760
<i>Everyone's shitting on you, asshole.</i>

494
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,200
<i>Song bashed you for hitting him today.</i>

495
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,400
<i>Damn, now everyone is shitting on you.</i>

496
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,800
<i>What are you gonna do?</i>

497
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,560
<i>Hey, Kong?</i>

498
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,560
- What?
<i>- Are you okay?</i>

499
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,200
<i>- Calm down, okay?</i>
- Well...

500
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,000
- Okay.
<i>- Are you really okay?</i>

501
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,320
<i>Fine, then. I'll send you the link, okay?</i>

502
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,400
<i>Call me if you need anything.</i>

503
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,800
- All right.
<i>- Okay?</i>

504
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,880
Okay.

505
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,760
DEATH BY TRUTH

506
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,520
<i>I'm telling you,
this prick is a clout chaser.</i>

507
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,120
- HE SHOULD PAY
- SERVES HIM RIGHT

508
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,880
<i>He messed with her life to get views.</i>

509
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,440
<i>Anyone could see
that they were chicken bones,</i>

510
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,320
<i>but he said it was a dog's skull.</i>

511
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,560
<i>Even when we had proof
that they were chicken bones,</i>

512
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,440
<i>he still kept lying.</i>

513
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,800
<i>He wouldn't own up.</i>

514
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,120
SHAME ON YOU. WTF?

515
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,880
- DOGS? BULLSHIT
- OWN UP TO THIS

516
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,400
- IT'S CHICKEN, NOT DOG
- MORON

517
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,560
<i>It's a dog's head.</i>

518
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,800
<i>How could you do this, Aunty?</i>

519
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,480
<i>What the fuck have you fed us?</i>

520
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,280
- YOU'D BE CRAZY TO BELIEVE HIM
- DOG, MY ASS

521
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,400
<i>Motherfucker!</i>

522
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,680
<i>Let me go! What the fuck?</i>

523
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,880
<i>Shit!</i>

524
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,520
- WHAT A MORON
- WTF IS WRONG WITH HIM?

525
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,520
SO FUNNY, HAHA

526
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,440
<i>Shit.</i>

527
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,040
HE'S FIGHTING WITH A SHADING NET

528
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,360
<i>- Fuck you!
- Is this what you want? Well?</i>

529
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,320
<i>Break them up!
Kong, come with me! Damn asshole.</i>

530
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,600
<i>Calm down!</i>

531
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,360
- IT'S JUST HIM
- CHANGE SCHOOLS, KONG

532
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,680
<i>I saw all your comments,
so I had to make another video.</i>

533
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,240
<i>I bet he's getting a shit ton of flak.</i>

534
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,520
<i>I'm sure he's made a video
to apologize to Aunty Jong.</i>

535
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,600
<i>He's all like,</i>

536
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,200
<i>"I'm sorry. I didn't know better."</i>

537
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,080
<i>"I'll learn from this mistake."</i>

538
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,000
<i>"Blah, blah." Piece of shit.</i>

539
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,720
<i>I bet he'll release a video like that.</i>

540
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,480
<i>Kong is such a pussy.</i>

541
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,600
Fuck you!

542
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,480
Why did it turn out like this, fucker?

543
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,080
I'm leaving now.

544
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,640
- See you tomorrow.
<i>- </i>Okay, see you. Get home safely.

545
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,320
Oh, Jong,
are you all set for tomorrow?

546
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,000
Why are you done so soon today?

547
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,360
No, I'm not done yet.
I'm still missing some ingredients.

548
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,240
I have to go to buy chicken at the market.

549
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,920
They said they'd deliver it today,
but they haven't.

550
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,040
I'll get the chicken
and come back to stew it.

551
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,320
Mmm...

552
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,520
That's just it.
That's what I'm wondering about, Jong.

553
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:38,000
You serve spicy pork bone soup.
What do you need chicken for? Right?

554
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,320
Mr. Pob also said
that you use black chicken.

555
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,600
Why do you have to use black chicken?

556
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,960
This recipe is quite strange, isn't it?

557
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,640
Honestly, Jong,

558
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,520
what do you put in it? Huh?

559
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,600
Oh, come on.

560
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,000
You're not answering me.

561
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,160
It must be a special secret recipe.

562
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,560
That's amazing.

563
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,320
Well, you're quite something, Jong.

564
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:08,160
By the way,
are you really leaving this place?

565
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,680
Well, I have to stay
till the end of the month,

566
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,760
then I'll go.

567
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,480
You poor thing.

568
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,160
What school are you going to work at next?

569
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,920
Nowhere, I suppose.

570
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,960
I doubt any school would hire me now.

571
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,280
My goodness.

572
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,400
Are you going now? We can leave together.

573
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,640
- Yes. Let's go.
- Okay.

574
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,400
Get home safely.
See you tomorrow.

575
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,400
Hmm?

576
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,120
It's nothing.

577
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,160
Just my imagination.

578
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,360
I'd better go home.

579
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,440
It's creepy in here.

580
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,240
All done.

581
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,800
I'm out. Man, it's been so hot all day.

582
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,840
What the fuck?

583
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,720
Oh.

584
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,040
Damn it, Jong.

585
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,280
Are you a cook or a witch?

586
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,360
Wow.

587
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,440
Compared to this,

588
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,480
a dead cat in my bag is nothing.

589
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,400
This shit is way weirder.

590
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,440
I'll get you, Aunty Jong, you bitch.

591
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,600
I'll film everything.

592
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,760
What?

593
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,360
Shit. Why is it acting up now?

594
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,760
What do you want?

595
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,680
Well?

596
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,760
You think I'm scared?

597
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,680
I'll get you.

598
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,440
Let go! Let go of me!

599
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,880
You're Jong's son, aren't you?

600
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,080
Didn't they say you died
by decapitation or some shit?

601
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,440
You and your mom are dicks.

602
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,200
You fooled the whole school,
and they all believe you.

603
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:40,000
Damn, you're not just a drug addict.
You're a horror film addict too.

604
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,600
Right, asshole?

605
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,480
Show me your face if you dare!

606
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,400
Well?

607
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,520
Fuck!

608
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,160
Everyone, have you seen this?

609
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,520
- What is it, Miss?
- Kong has lost it.

610
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,560
Many people say he's a clout chaser.

611
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,600
This comment is interesting.

612
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,280
"Kong, what stuff did you take? Tell me."

613
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,560
As in drugs?

614
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,600
Yes.
I guess we have to watch him closely.

615
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,600
Mr. Pob, please help me.

616
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,760
Mr. Pob.

617
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,640
Mr. Pob, please help me, sir.

618
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,160
Open the door, sir. Mr. Pob!

619
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,760
Sir, open the door!

620
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,480
- Sir, listen to me. Please, sir.
- You have to help me.

621
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,560
There's a ghost, Mr. Pob.

622
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,440
It's the ghost of Jong's son.
He's trying to kill me.

623
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,520
He just tried to kill me over there.

624
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,960
What are you playing at, Kong?

625
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,600
I'm not playing, sir.
There really is a ghost.

626
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,880
He broke down the door.
He just tried to kill me.

627
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,520
Take a look.
If you don't believe me, let's go.

628
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,600
Come on.

629
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,800
- He was down there.
- Let go.

630
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,640
Let's go take a look. Go out there.
Here. You go down there. You'll see him.

631
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,280
He's there, I swear.
Sir, please believe me.

632
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,800
If you're making it up
to get more views online,

633
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,720
go do it somewhere else.

634
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,720
Stop causing trouble for others.

635
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,240
I'm starting to believe
what they said about you

636
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,080
being high out of your mind on drugs.

637
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:27,920
There really is a ghost. I'm serious.
He's in that bitch Jong's kitchen.

638
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,560
If you don't believe me, go and see.
Why don't you go and see?

639
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:35,600
And at this hour,
what were you doing inside Jong's kitchen?

640
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,000
Mmm.

641
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:41,360
I asked you a question.
What were you doing inside Jong's kitchen?

642
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,280
What have you done to her now?

643
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,200
- Damn.
- What?

644
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,800
What's wrong with you?
Why are you taking that bitch Jong's side?

645
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,240
- What?
- You're being very rude, Kong.

646
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,280
I've had enough of you.

647
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,720
Social media users already know
the truth about Aunty Jong.

648
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,240
Why won't you stop this?

649
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,920
I see.

650
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,880
Now you believe what's on social media?

651
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,120
Pointing is rude.

652
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,800
Fine.

653
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,440
Fine.

654
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,240
- Kong. Kong.
- Kong.

655
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,720
What is it with this kid?

656
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,040
So full of himself.

657
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,520
Whatever the fuck you are, come at me.

658
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,920
I'll cut you to pieces.

659
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,920
Come on.

660
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,560
Who the fuck tied this? Fuck you, Jong.

661
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,520
Shit!

662
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,440
Her son was decapitated.

663
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,640
His head still hasn't been found.

664
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,160
Shit!

665
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,000
Ghost! Shit!

666
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,440
I'm scared. Stop it.

667
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,880
Enough, son.

668
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,960
That's enough, son.

669
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,000
Aunty.

670
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,360
Aunty Jong.

671
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,680
Aunty Jong, I'm... I'm sorry.

672
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:22,440
Aunty Jong, help me.
Please, Aunty Jong. I'm sorry, Aunty Jong.

673
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,160
I'm sorry,

674
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,760
but this is the truth,
and I've felt bad about it all this time.

675
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,720
I just want to make a living.

676
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,920
I'm sorry, Aunty Jong.

677
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,600
I promise not to tell anyone about today,
Aunty Jong, I promise.

678
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,320
But you have to help me, Aunty Jong.

679
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,760
Please listen to me.

680
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:45,680
I'm sorry.

681
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:48,920
Please, Aunty.

682
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,840
I understand you.

683
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,320
You have nothing to worry about.

684
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:54,920
Don't worry.

685
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,160
I promise not to say anything about today

686
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,240
and about

687
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:01,680
how you

688
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,920
made soup with a human head.

689
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,600
I promise, I'll tell no one.

690
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:09,400
I promise, Aunty Jong. Please help me.

691
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,600
I'm sorry.

692
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
I shouldn't have chosen this path.

693
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,720
Okay.

694
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,040
Then let's leave together, Aunty Jong.

695
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,280
Let's go.

696
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:31,600
I was planning on leaving here quietly
at the end of the month.

697
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,400
I didn't want any trouble with you.

698
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:39,600
Aunty, I'm so sorry.
I promise I won't mess with you anymore.

699
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,560
But you wouldn't stop trying to hurt me.

700
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,240
You were trying to use a dead cat

701
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,480
to hurt me.

702
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:57,440
Aunty Jong, listen to me.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

703
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,720
I didn't mean to do that.

704
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,520
- I can explain.
- Get out!

705
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,840
What's the point?

706
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,680
I did everything...

707
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,040
...for my stall to survive.

708
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,680
I did everything

709
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:23,520
to be with my son forever.

710
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,400
I did everything

711
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,720
to protect my beliefs
from whoever would destroy them.

712
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,520
But you...

713
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,600
you stuck your nose
in my fucking business.

714
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,520
I'm sorry.

715
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,080
Those things you always wanted to know,

716
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,200
you know them now.

717
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,560
Are you happy now?

718
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,320
Well? Are you happy now?

719
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,760
- Aunty.
- My son's bone broth...

720
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,400
How was it?

721
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,480
- Was it good?
- I'm sorry.

722
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,120
Fuck.

723
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,360
Why is Aunty Jong's soup extra good today?

724
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,200
I'll have three bowls for sure.

725
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:49,800
Oh yeah. What the fuck is wrong with Kong?

726
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,600
He's missing school again.

727
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,000
He's missing
something tasty too.

728
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,560
He wouldn't dare show up.

729
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:02,760
He was supposed to apologize to Aunty Jong
during the morning assembly.

730
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:03,680
You're right.

731
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,120
He must be avoiding it.

732
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,880
I don't think he'll show up
anywhere for a while.

733
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:10,560
Mmm.

734
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:14,960
Hey, last night, some people saw him
hanging around at the cafeteria.

735
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,240
- He doesn't know when to quit.
- Shit!

736
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:20,400
You should ask Aunty Jong.
Maybe she saw him.

737
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,640
Damn. The soup is so fucking tasty today.
It's so goddamn good.

738
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,760
Uh...

739
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:31,680
You guys.

740
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,320
- Shit!
- Shit!

741
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,760
Hey, what's going on?

742
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:40,440
Wait.

743
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:43,320
TASTY SPICY PORK BONE SOUP

744
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:47,440
TASTY SPICY SKULL SOUP

745
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:53,680
Hello.

746
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,120
I'm Kong,

747
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,160
or Click, the Hardcore Truth-seeker.

748
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Today,

749
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,480
I'm going to apologize for...

750
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,400
I'm going to apologize for what I've done.

751
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:12,360
Honestly, maybe it's all my fault because...

752
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,840
It's because I'm such...

753
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,680
a clout chaser, and I...

754
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,200
and I...

755
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,880
I didn't know
any better, and I'm...

756
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,760
I'm sorry.
