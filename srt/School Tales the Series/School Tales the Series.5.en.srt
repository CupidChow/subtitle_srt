1
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:44,320
MONDAY

2
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,480
Help! Help!

3
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,560
Help! Help!

4
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,800
Help!

5
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,480
Let me go, you dumb losers,

6
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,560
or I'll tell the teacher.

7
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,920
Jeez, we just want to copy your homework.
Why are you making such a fuss?

8
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,960
Yeah, don't be selfish.

9
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,400
Because of you,
I've been tired all morning.

10
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,000
You irresponsible jerks!

11
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,120
You can't even do your homework.

12
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,600
- How will you do your jobs?
- Hurry. He's so loud.

13
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,160
You single-celled organisms!
Animals with only 84,000 brain cells!

14
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,440
Damn you, animals...

15
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,120
Yeah, it's great.

16
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,760
Keep it, sweetie.

17
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,680
I'm not thirsty.

18
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,920
Aunt Noy,

19
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,320
when will you pay me back?

20
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,040
Let me see how much you owe me.

21
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,880
The loan is 3,000 baht

22
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,120
with 10% interest,

23
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,840
and you're six months overdue.

24
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,240
Altogether,

25
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,600
you owe me

26
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,360
5,314.683 baht.

27
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,040
I'll tell you what,
I'll give you a discount.

28
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,040
You owe me

29
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,320
5,877 baht in total.

30
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,400
Come on, Teacha Waiwan.

31
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,120
Stop!

32
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,080
Pronounce the R clearly. Say, "teacher."

33
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,680
And it's pronounced "Wai-ya-wan."

34
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,400
Teacher Wai-ya-wan.

35
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,040
Very good, Aunt Noy.

36
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,920
You didn't even give me
a discount of half a baht.

37
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,160
Your interest rate's so high.

38
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,040
Who could afford to pay it?

39
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,000
I don't have the money right now.
I'll pay you later, all right?

40
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,080
Pay me later?

41
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,960
That's not what you said
when you asked for the loan.

42
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,760
"Teacher Waiwan, please help me.
The lottery dealers are going to kill me."

43
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,480
They were going to kill you, remember?

44
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,600
Come on.

45
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,360
Who would have known

46
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,120
that you would be
even worse than the dealers?

47
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,800
What? Me? Worse?

48
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,320
No, you are the worst.

49
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,640
Nong and Nan, watch out for her.

50
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,240
COVID-19 is not as scary as Aunt Noy.

51
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,440
When we get COVID-19,
we feel the symptoms,

52
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,720
but she's a debtor
who feels nothing at all,

53
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,760
and you never know when she'll pay. Well?

54
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,520
- What did you do with all your money?
- Is something wrong?

55
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,760
Hello, Teacher Nop.

56
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,640
Nothing's wrong.

57
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,120
Right, Aunt Noy?

58
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,680
- Right.
- That's good.

59
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,376
- Yes.
- I want to say something.

60
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,560
We all work here,
so we should try to get along.

61
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,800
- Of course.
- Most importantly, students are watching.

62
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,960
If we fight in front of them,
we could set a bad example for them.

63
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,200
- That's right.
- Mr. Principal.

64
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,480
See, we're teachas. It's embarrassing...

65
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,640
- Stop!
- Yes?

66
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,720
Teacher with an R.

67
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,760
Pronounce the R clearly. Say, "teacher."

68
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,680
Teacha.

69
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,880
No!

70
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,320
Pronounce the R. Say, "teacher."

71
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,240
- Teacher.
- Very good.

72
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,720
- That's how leaders should speak.
- Well...

73
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,440
Teacher Nop mentioned embarrassment.

74
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,800
The one who should be the most ashamed is,
in fact, you, Mr. Principal.

75
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,400
You've owed me money for six months.

76
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,040
Well, let's settle it now.

77
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,680
Your six-month debt is 24,000 baht,

78
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,320
plus another 25,000
for a gold lotto ticket.

79
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,120
Mr. Principal!

80
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,120
Sir! Sir!

81
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,576
Look at their faces.

82
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,080
You never have money,
never run, and never pay.

83
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,640
Hey, students!

84
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,560
- Hey!
- What are you doing here?

85
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,576
- She's here.
- Why aren't you in class?

86
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,440
- Run!
- Go!

87
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,800
Go right now! These damn kids.
What will they do with their lives...

88
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,000
"Why didn't you do your homework?"

89
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,960
"Hello, students."

90
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,560
"Hello, students."

91
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,880
Explain it to me right now!

92
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,720
Hey, what have you done, you crazy kids?

93
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,640
Who did this? Who is behind this?

94
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,800
I know who did it!

95
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,480
HELLO, OGRESS

96
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,280
<i>Students,</i>

97
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,080
<i>you behaved so disrespectfully
towards your teacher.</i>

98
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,720
<i>You love to have fun.</i>

99
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,400
- Hilarious.
- Yeah.

100
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,040
<i>But you don't spare a thought
for your victims' feelings</i>

101
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,240
<i>and how traumatized and hurt they may be.</i>

102
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,400
- Thanakorn.
- Yes, ma'am.

103
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,880
Cross your arms.

104
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,600
Face that way.

105
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,120
Do you know

106
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,560
why my cane is short?

107
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,320
No.

108
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,320
It's so that every time I cane students,

109
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,560
my hand will hurt too.

110
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,160
Then why hit us at all?

111
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,240
Cross your arms!

112
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,120
Remember this, and don't do it again.

113
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,200
Go!

114
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,400
- Pita.
- Yes, ma'am.

115
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,480
Come here.

116
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,880
Cross your arms.

117
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,080
Remember, won't you? There!

118
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,520
Come here, you two.
Don't ever do it again.

119
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,880
Take this.

120
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,440
That looks painful.

121
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,560
You can go!

122
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,320
Thank you, ma'am. Come on, hurry up.

123
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,040
<i>Teacher Waiwan.</i>

124
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,120
Yes!

125
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,720
Hey, look, they got caned.

126
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,440
- It hurts.
- It hurts so much. It hurts.

127
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,560
What's so funny?

128
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,680
Have you guys ever been punished
in front of the flagpole like me?

129
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,920
Please.
I'm notorious, you know.

130
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,320
That's right.

131
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,400
It hurts. Here you go.

132
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,640
- You must be so proud.
- Thanks.

133
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,600
Tell me something.

134
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,680
Why do you like teasing
Teacher Waiwan so much?

135
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,480
Well, look at her.

136
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,880
She's a tyrant. She's bad-tempered.

137
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,240
- Yeah?
- She's loud.

138
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,520
Fussy about rules and old-fashioned.

139
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,760
- Yeah?
- She's fat too.

140
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,360
That's body-shaming.

141
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,280
- Hey.
- I mean... nothing.

142
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,080
I won't stand for it.

143
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,480
I'll get back at her.

144
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,800
Exactly.

145
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,000
One good turn deserves another.
An eye for an eye.

146
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,600
And revenge

147
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,560
is a dish best served cold.

148
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,320
Move over.

149
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,040
Hey, mister. Damn.

150
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,600
So, Tim,

151
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,800
how will you get back at her?

152
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,520
Well...

153
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,320
A GIRL

154
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,240
I know how to get back at Teacher Waiwan,

155
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,760
the ogress.

156
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,280
SCHOOL DORMITORY

157
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,840
There's no one here.

158
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,920
This time, she'll go viral for sure.

159
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,200
I bet she will.

160
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,480
Hey, Ping, set up the camera.

161
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,560
All right.

162
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,680
Shit, my battery's about to die.
Give me your phone.

163
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,200
Damn, you're never prepared for anything.

164
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,680
Take it. Hurry.

165
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,080
Boo!

166
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,280
Boo!

167
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,120
Boo!

168
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,856
- Yeah, that's so good.
- She's gonna get it.

169
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,800
Hey, she's coming.

170
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,520
- Go and hide.
- Hurry up.

171
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,680
Boo!

172
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,840
Hello, little ghosts.

173
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,840
Come back.

174
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,960
Ping, jump down!

175
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,160
Hurry! Hurry!

176
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,960
- It hurts!
- Hurry up! Come on!

177
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,400
Hurry!

178
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,480
TUESDAY

179
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,400
GREENHOUSE

180
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,320
Have some water.

181
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Oh.

182
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,880
Hmm.

183
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,160
Hi, little mushrooms.

184
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,440
Grow fast, you guys.

185
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,800
Hey.

186
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,640
<i>Her body was buried in the greenhouse.</i>

187
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,680
As for Teacher Waiwan's head,

188
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,520
the police still haven't found it yet.

189
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,720
- Really?
- For real?

190
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,200
- Shit.
- Yeah.

191
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:08,320
The police suspect
that she was killed early in the evening.

192
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,280
The killer's motive was probably debt,

193
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,840
or maybe they stole from her.

194
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,680
But they've ruled out adultery.

195
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,320
What's the corpse like?

196
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:23,680
That means the ghost we saw last night
must have been Teacher Waiwan.

197
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,720
She was really pale.

198
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,640
Right.

199
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,080
Teacher Waiwan was so pale.
Her head wasn't just cut off, but, like...

200
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,120
- Ping.
- I got chills.

201
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,120
Where's my phone?

202
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,840
Shit, I left it in her room.
I was too busy running away.

203
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,240
Damn. Go back and get it.

204
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,120
It's your phone, so go get it yourself.

205
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,320
But you left it there.

206
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,680
But it's your phone.

207
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,320
- How dare you push me?
- Hey.

208
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,640
It's not my phone.

209
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,640
- Go get it.
- Don't come any closer!

210
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,600
Come here.

211
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,320
I'll finish you! Come on.

212
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,320
- Come on!
- Hey!

213
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,000
- Hey.
- Go on. Hit him! Yeah.

214
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,120
Hey, go on! Hit him! More!

215
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,760
Novice, are you afraid of ghosts?

216
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,840
- Yes.
- What?

217
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,920
Ping, you brought a novice
who's scared of ghosts?

218
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,120
Then we're not going to pay you for this.

219
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,880
Actually, I'm not scared. That was a joke.

220
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,960
Good.

221
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,480
Wait, Ping. Get behind me.

222
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,160
Okay.

223
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,840
Go on, novice.

224
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,720
DORMITORY CHAPERONE: MS. WAIWAN PHISITSOOK

225
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,440
Ping, you almost walked into me.

226
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,160
Sprinkle it everywhere, okay?

227
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,800
Make sure it's enough.

228
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,640
Ping, go get my phone.

229
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,200
Okay.

230
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,480
Did you find it?

231
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,600
No.

232
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,040
- I'll help you find it.
- Okay.

233
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,080
THE TRIPITAKA

234
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,480
WHERE IS IT?

235
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:35,480
YOU'RE GETTING... DEMERITS

236
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,640
Teacher,

237
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,440
I'm sorry.

238
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,560
I really didn't mean it.

239
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,840
YOU'RE GETTING... DEMERITS

240
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,720
Hey, Ping, did you find it?

241
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,360
Not yet.

242
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,120
Try calling me, then.

243
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,760
Okay.

244
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:28,120
I don't think your phone is in this room.

245
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,520
Let's go.

246
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,280
Hey, the call got cut off.

247
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,120
Yeah, it went silent.

248
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,840
Novice, take the lead.

249
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,920
Go ahead.

250
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,400
- Novice!
- Hey, novice!

251
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,480
Jeez.

252
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:31,400
Hey, open the door! Hey!

253
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,000
- Hey!
- Why is it closed?

254
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,400
- No!
- Hey!

255
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,440
Shit!

256
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,080
- What should we do?
- It's your phone.

257
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,800
But you left it there.

258
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,600
Yeah, it's my fault.

259
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,080
What are you doing?

260
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,080
Teacher, may I please have the phone back?

261
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,120
Are you crazy?

262
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,560
She's got no head. How can she hear you?

263
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,560
Shit,

264
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,640
she can hear me.

265
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,960
Shit!

266
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,840
Oh dear.

267
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,080
Don't be frightened, darlings.
Don't be frightened, darlings.

268
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,600
Shit.

269
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,240
She's headless, and she's also a zombie?

270
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,760
I don't think so.

271
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,960
It looks like she wants to say something.

272
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,080
Yes, I need your help.

273
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,600
Crawling?

274
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,520
Swimming?

275
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,960
No.

276
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,560
Playing golf?

277
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,960
- Running?
- Running?

278
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,760
To where?

279
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,200
- Find.
- Find.

280
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,080
- Head.
- Head.

281
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,960
Yes!

282
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,640
Find head.

283
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,120
Find my head.

284
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,600
Yes!

285
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,920
Hey. No. Don't.

286
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,480
- Don't come closer.
- Go.

287
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,480
- No.
- Go.

288
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,800
No.

289
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,320
We won't look for it.

290
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,920
All right, ma'am. We'll find it.

291
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,600
But may I please have my phone back first?

292
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,960
Let's go.

293
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,320
Promise?

294
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,520
Okay. Deal.

295
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,160
Let's go.

296
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,360
Yes!

297
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,040
Whoo!

298
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:54,360
I'm going to get my head back.
Go and find it, kids! Yes!

299
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,760
I'll be able to see soon.

300
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,680
Head? Where is my head, anyway?

301
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,000
Tim, are you really going to help
Teacher Waiwan's ghost find her head?

302
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,440
Jeez, who'd be crazy enough to do that?

303
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,800
I said yes, but I didn't mean it.

304
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,800
You just lied to her?
Aren't you afraid she'll break your neck?

305
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Why should I be?

306
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,160
If she breaks my neck,
she'll break yours too.

307
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,880
What the hell, dude?

308
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,960
I'm gonna take a shower.
And it's just your neck, not mine.

309
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,960
I'm going.

310
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,640
<i>Good coloring. Creative.</i>

311
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,680
<i>Good character design.</i>

312
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,920
<i>Work on the background a bit,
and it'll be great.</i>

313
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,720
<i>You have much room to grow.</i>

314
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,480
<i>Nice line art.</i>

315
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,000
Out of the way!

316
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,680
WEDNESDAY

317
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,240
Hey, Tim. Hey, Tim.

318
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,400
Huge news.

319
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,840
Is it worse than ordering basil stir-fry
and getting goddamn long beans in it?

320
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,440
Damn.

321
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,440
- What now?
- It happened last night.

322
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,920
The principal saw Teacher Waiwan's ghost.

323
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
What?

324
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,120
They said...

325
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,880
she came to collect her money

326
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,440
<i>because the principal owes her
the largest sum.</i>

327
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,480
<i>It happened when he was practicing
ballroom dancing with his girlfriend.</i>

328
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,280
She's jumping too. Oh no.

329
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,440
Help me! Help!

330
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,760
She's holding me.

331
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,000
I'm dead. I'm so dead. That's it.

332
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,200
Oh no, I'm dead.

333
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,320
She's come to collect my debt.

334
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,880
She must have been demanding
money from the principal

335
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,680
because he said he'd pay her back.

336
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:14,640
Now all her debtors are scared to death.

337
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,360
Nobody knows

338
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,520
who's going to be the ghost's next victim.

339
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,160
What if

340
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,720
it's us who are next?

341
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,680
Don't say that it's us.

342
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,800
You were with me the whole time!
Of course it's both of us.

343
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,200
Tim.

344
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,560
You broke your promise.

345
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,560
Aren't you going to find my head?

346
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,960
Okay. Deal.

347
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,840
THURSDAY

348
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,520
- Hey, Ping.
- What?

349
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,360
I think I'll help Teacher Waiwan
find her head as promised.

350
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,880
If I don't,

351
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,520
she probably won't rest in peace.

352
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,200
Then you should make sure you find it.

353
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,280
As for me, I'm out.

354
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,000
- Where are you going?
- I'm not helping.

355
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,640
- You're the one who promised her.
- You have to help me.

356
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,440
- I won't help.
- No, you have to help.

357
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,880
No, I won't help.

358
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,760
Why did you close your eyes?

359
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,080
Well, I was just taking time
to consider whether to help you or not.

360
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,200
And I've decided

361
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,240
that I am

362
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,880
not helping you.

363
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,360
If you won't help me,

364
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,920
I'll tell everyone

365
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,440
that you just tried to kiss me.

366
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,760
Shit.
What should I do? Damn it.

367
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,120
Why wouldn't I help you?

368
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,680
You're my best friend.

369
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,480
If you need anything, just ask me.
Don't even worry about it.

370
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,440
Get your hand off me.
Don't get carried away again.

371
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,400
Want me to scrub your back?

372
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,640
Want me to kick your ass?

373
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:35,880
Ma'am, do you remember anything
about when you were killed?

374
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,400
When I was killed?

375
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,120
I don't know.

376
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,480
Ma'am, how does it feel to be headless?

377
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,920
I really want to know.

378
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,080
I feel like...

379
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,040
Do you need to piss?

380
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,360
You crazy kid.

381
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,240
- No, I don't.
- Ouch.

382
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,440
I kind of feel...

383
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,240
Maybe she's cold?

384
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,120
Yes, it's cold.

385
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,320
Cold.

386
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,200
Cold?

387
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,560
That means your head
must be hidden at the North Pole.

388
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,200
Damn.

389
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,680
- That hurt.
- Are you nuts?

390
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,680
I was just joking, you know.

391
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,800
She feels cold.

392
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,680
That means it must be
hidden somewhere cold.

393
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,360
Ice?

394
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,440
A fridge?

395
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,600
Aunt Noy.

396
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,720
- Aunt Noy?
- Yes.

397
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,080
Before you died,
you argued with her, didn't you?

398
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,520
That's right.

399
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,680
Aunt Noy might have got angry

400
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,880
and killed you.

401
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,360
- Oh no.
- She was so mad, she cut off your head.

402
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,720
- Oh dear.
- Then she put it in the fridge.

403
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:06,200
Maybe she even scooped out your brain
and made herself an iced drink with it.

404
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,320
- Oh no.
- Yes.

405
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,160
The killer must be Aunty Noy.

406
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,880
Aunty Noy?

407
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,680
She didn't pay me back,
and she also killed me?

408
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,760
Is it really her? Aunty Noy?

409
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,240
Aunty Noy! She killed me!

410
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,320
Right. This is delicious.

411
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,040
She blended the brain for herself
and for the students too.

412
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,840
Man, what a monster she is.

413
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,360
You're being ridiculous.

414
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,560
Ridiculous? How?

415
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,400
Just keep an eye on her.

416
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,520
TOILET BREAK. I'LL BE BACK SOON.

417
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,680
Hey.

418
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,520
I think now's the time.

419
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,040
- Let's go.
- Right.

420
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,120
Hey, Tim, follow me.

421
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,280
What? How did you get here?

422
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,120
Jeez, why are you so dumb?

423
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,880
I just walked in.
Why did you crawl through?

424
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,640
Well, like Detective Conan, you know.

425
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,720
Damn. Conan is not this stupid.

426
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,160
Come on. Let's find it.

427
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,280
Did you find it?

428
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,720
No, it's not there.

429
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,880
Shit. I've found it.

430
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,360
- Really?
- Yes.

431
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,280
- Grab it.
- What are you doing?

432
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,760
Are you stealing from me?

433
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,080
Answer me!

434
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,480
We're not thieves.

435
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,040
- But you're a cold-blooded killer.
- Yeah.

436
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,240
The evidence is in the fridge.

437
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,160
Show her.

438
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,240
Okay.

439
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,440
Aunty.

440
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,040
Here's the evidence.

441
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,680
A watermelon?

442
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,760
What do we do?

443
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,840
You damn idiot.

444
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,080
Aunty, I have to go.

445
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,440
Hey, Tim!

446
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,960
It's a watermelon. So what?

447
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,560
You grew it from a seed.

448
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,600
And when it got big, you cut it up

449
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,520
and put it in the fridge.

450
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,680
Why are you so cruel?

451
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,480
Don't you feel bad for the watermelon?

452
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,240
It's okay.

453
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,320
Ping, so where's this murderer of yours?

454
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,640
I've eaten so much evidence
that I need to piss.

455
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,640
Sorry, man.

456
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,960
Damn it.

457
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,680
Be careful.

458
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,600
Hey.

459
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,800
What are you doing?

460
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,000
My skateboard got stuck in there.

461
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,520
Get away from there.

462
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,120
I'll get it for you.

463
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,400
- Here.
- Thank you.

464
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,600
Go play somewhere else.
Don't hang around here.

465
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,680
Yes, sir.

466
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,160
Well, go on. Hurry.

467
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,080
We're going.

468
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,600
Damn, don't make me kick your ass.

469
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,400
Exactly. One good turn deserves another.

470
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,160
An eye for an eye.

471
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,080
And revenge is a dish best served cold.

472
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,720
- Hey, Ping.
- What?

473
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,560
Isn't Rhang being weird?

474
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,840
Yeah, I think so.

475
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,360
It's like he's hiding something
in that room there.

476
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,640
Hey, Tim.

477
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,520
Where has Teacher Waiwan gone?

478
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,840
Sitting in there, looking sad.

479
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,600
- Ping.
- Yeah?

480
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,520
We have to find her head.

481
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,120
I feel bad for her.

482
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,200
Yeah.

483
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,400
Where is my head?

484
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,600
The kids didn't find it
at Aunty Noy's stall.

485
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,320
My dear body,

486
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,240
come and find your head.

487
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,520
Get home safely, kids.

488
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,600
Come on, Ping.

489
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,960
- Hurry up. Let's go.
- Okay.

490
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,560
Ping!

491
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,360
Why aren't you back in your dorm?

492
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,160
Well, I'm on my way there.

493
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,360
What are you doing here? Where's Tim?

494
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,480
Tim!

495
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,120
Hey. Wait. Hold on, Uncle Rhang. No.

496
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,560
Those are just barrels.

497
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,080
I don't know where Tim's gone.

498
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,480
Then go back to your dorm.

499
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,080
Hey, Uncle Rhang.

500
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,040
I'm going to treat you
to some fried meatballs.

501
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,280
Let's go. Come with me.

502
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,200
- Come on.
- But you...

503
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,240
Come on, it's my treat.
I'll buy you some.

504
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,576
- Come on.
- And gold egg yolk drops?

505
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,520
Sure thing.

506
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,416
- Let's go.
- Why are you so hungry now?

507
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,440
I just am.

508
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,400
Come on.

509
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,920
No need to fix AC units or whatever.

510
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,120
Damn it, Ping.

511
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,360
What should I do?

512
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,400
Shit.

513
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,040
Why are you being so nice to me today?

514
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,480
I'm feeling generous today.

515
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,760
- What? Frivolous?
- No. Generous. Come on.

516
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,280
- Okay, kid.
- Hello, Uncle Rhang.

517
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:27,200
I was just going to look for you.
A ceiling light upstairs is out.

518
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,560
Can you fix it for me?

519
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,720
Of course, miss.

520
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,920
I'll go get the ladder and my tools.

521
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
- Thanks.
- Wait.

522
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,040
- What about the meatballs?
- I'll be back.

523
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,360
Damn it.

524
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,720
That hurts.

525
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,320
Yes, ma'am.

526
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,040
After you.

527
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,760
Yes?

528
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,320
Head?

529
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,600
Find the head in here?

530
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,480
All right, ma'am.

531
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,440
Where is it?

532
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,320
What?

533
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,720
Ma'am.

534
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,240
Body?

535
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,096
- My head's here.
- Are you okay?

536
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,600
My dear body, your head is here.

537
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,400
My dear body!

538
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,680
Keep looking? All right.

539
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,880
My dear body,

540
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,760
your head's here.

541
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,160
Is it in the drain?

542
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,800
Ew, that reeks.

543
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,600
Ma'am?

544
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,920
Yes. Absolutely.

545
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,720
It's urgent, isn't it?

546
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,200
- Certainly. I'll go get my things.
- No.

547
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,640
I won't be long.

548
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,440
Go and hide, ma'am. Quick.

549
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,560
Sure.

550
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,920
Tim. Tim.

551
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,600
- What?
- Shush.

552
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,040
Be quiet. Don't make a sound.

553
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,280
Take the head too.

554
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,800
Take the head too.

555
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,480
Teacher Nop, I found her head.

556
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,280
I've had it with kids these days.

557
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,080
There are so many other places out there
for you to mess around.

558
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,640
You must love your Teacher Waiwan so much.

559
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,480
Good. I'll send you to hell to see her.

560
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,200
My head.

561
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,080
That hurts.

562
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,560
Where are you running to?

563
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,360
Don't hurt me, Teacher Nop.

564
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,080
Let go!

565
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,520
Who is that? Let me go!

566
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,760
Waiwan will get you!

567
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,520
Now I remember.

568
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,880
It's you who killed me.

569
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,560
Nop, you asshole! Handsome but heartless!

570
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,200
Why did you kill me?

571
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,160
Yeah. It was me.

572
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,640
I already killed you once.

573
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,640
Don't think I won't do it again.

574
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,720
Good.

575
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,000
This time,

576
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,560
I'll get rid of both
human and ghost at once.

577
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,520
Tim!

578
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:24,640
Run away! Run away! Run away!

579
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,360
Don't hurt him!

580
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,600
Teacher Nop, what are you doing?
I'll take care of him.

581
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,840
Uncle Rhang, help me.

582
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,120
Uncle Rhang! Uncle Rhang, help!

583
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,400
- Take this.
- What?

584
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,120
Uncle Rhang!

585
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,440
- Uncle Rhang!
- Uncle Rhang, wake up!

586
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,520
Uncle Rhang!

587
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,680
Uncle Rhang!

588
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,680
Teacher Nop?

589
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,600
Don't come any closer.

590
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,000
I'm going to faint.

591
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,240
Damn it, Ping.

592
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,920
Uncle Rhang.

593
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,456
- Psycho teacher!
- You're dead!

594
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,480
Damn!

595
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,960
Ma'am, I'm sorry.

596
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,040
Sorry for what?

597
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,480
Huh?

598
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,920
Hey, be gentle.

599
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,920
Hey, Ping!

600
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,960
Please don't!

601
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:38,520
You damn kids!

602
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,080
Yes!

603
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:58,720
My dear body,
your head is here!

604
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,200
What the hell? Hey.

605
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:15,320
Uncle Rhang, are you going to hurt him
with the trash bag?

606
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,320
I'm a janitor.
Why shouldn't I have a trash bag?

607
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,400
Trash bag?

608
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,040
Uncle Rhang, I give up.

609
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,480
Please don't kill me.

610
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,560
Then tell us.

611
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,960
Why did you kill Teacher Waiwan?

612
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,320
- Come on.
- Don't, sir.

613
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,800
- Don't play so hard to get.
- Please don't hurt me.

614
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,240
- I beg you.
- I know that you like me too.

615
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,240
I saw you throwing yourself at me.

616
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,880
No, please.

617
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,080
Please don't.

618
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,000
- Nop!
- Uh...

619
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,520
Do you call yourself a teacher?

620
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,240
- No, that student was...
- Stop!

621
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,520
I never thought
you'd be like this.

622
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,360
I'm telling Mr. Principal about this!

623
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,720
The goddamn principal?

624
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,680
I'll tell you something.

625
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,000
That scum is even worse!

626
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,480
Tell him.

627
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,200
Go on!

628
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,280
Fine.

629
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:27,600
Then I'll use this video
to report you to the police!

630
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,040
Report me to the police?

631
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,440
Well?

632
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,120
So what?

633
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,040
Who will you tell?

634
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:44,000
Trying to dodge?

635
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,080
Huh?

636
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,120
Do you have the strength
to fight me?

637
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:47,520
Shit.

638
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:48,600
The head.

639
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,280
Where is it?

640
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:51,960
God damn it.

641
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,400
Where is it now?

642
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,240
Hey.

643
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,120
I'm screwed.

644
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,840
For fuck's sake.

645
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,120
FRIDAY

646
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:47,960
Thank you, my dears.

647
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:58,800
Be good.

648
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,480
Study hard, all right?

649
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,600
Ma'am,

650
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,360
I'm sorry for everything.

651
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,240
It's all right.

652
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:20,640
We hope that you rest in peace.

653
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,040
I forgive you for everything.

654
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,280
