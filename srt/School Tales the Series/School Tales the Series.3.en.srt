Me too, Dao. I liked and commented
on them too.

Look, Dao. Isn't it beautiful?

Try it.

how much powder would we need?

28
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,560
How many layers of it would be enough?

29
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,040
Well, look in the mirror.

I mean, look at our faces.
How can we compete with her?

Hello?

The shoot is at school?

<i>Yes, I got permission
from the school director.</i>

77
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,440
<i>I plan to do both your photo shoot</i>

78
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,600

Damn.

91

<i>Tell me what you did.
I want to be beautiful too.</i>

92

How many times do I have to say it?

94
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,560
I made a promise to them.

95
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,960
<i>Come on. Please tell me.</i>

96

You don't understand.

97
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,520
Just thinking about telling you...

98
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,160
Shit, I already feel like...

99
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,440
...like some weird shit is going on.

100

Shit.

102
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,080
They know. Shit.

103
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,240
You shouldn't have asked me.

104
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,176
<i>Hey, wait! Don't...</i>

105
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,360
Hey.

106
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,480
Have you seen Aim-Orn?

107
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,800
Hold on. Let me check.

108
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,400
Well, her latest photo looks like
it was taken in a bathroom here.

109
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,920
Here.

110
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,240
See the mirror?
That looks just like a school bathroom.

111
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,120
So... So you...

112
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,520
you follow Aim-Orn too?

113
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,280
Yeah, of course.
Everyone at our school does.

114
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,440
What the hell?
She's been so jumpy since she got pretty.

115
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,520
Yeah.

116
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,360
I wouldn't mind being jumpy
if it meant I got to be pretty.

117
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,160
By the way, someone asked Aim-Orn
what she did to get so much prettier.

118
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,320
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

119
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,400
Well, what did she do?

120
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,680
I want to be beautiful too.

121
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,160
I have no clue.

122
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,360
She wouldn't answer, no matter what.

123
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,400
Could it be a ghost remedy?

124
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,720
Only ghosts can answer that.

125
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,040
- That's crazy.
- People don't know their secrets.

126
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,480
You're crazy.

127
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,320
- Hey.
- What?

128
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,160
Have you seen Aim-Orn?

129
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,520
- Uh...
- Well?

130
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,000
- Didn't you see her leave?
- Yeah.

131
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,120
You're useless.

132
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,680
What?

133
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,920
Dao.

134
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,760
What are you up to?

135
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,480
Nothing, ma'am.

136
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Aim. Aim.

137
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,360
Can I talk to you?

138
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,560
So, you want to sign a contract
with an agency, right?

139
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,920
- I can give you some advice.
- You can help me, Dao?

140
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,200
Of course.

141
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,120
What a strange question.

142
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,400
Thanks.

143
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,960
By the way, can I ask you something?

144
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,240
What did you do to get prettier?

145
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,320
Well...

146
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,600
I can't tell you. Sorry.

147
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,360
Why not, Aim?

148
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,400
Please tell me. Please?

149
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,640
I... I had cosmetic surgery.

150
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,680
That's not true.

151
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,960
What sort of surgery

152
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,240
could your face recover from overnight?

153
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,040
Even if that were possible,
you wouldn't be able to afford it.

154
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,640
I really can't tell you.

155
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,920
I made a promise to them.

156
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,800
It's too risky.

157
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,960
Aim.

158
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,440
We'll keep it between the two of us.
I won't tell anyone.

159
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,920
It's too hard to believe.

160
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,720
No matter how unbelievable it is,
it happened, didn't it?

161
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,560
Look at you.

162
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,040
Aim.

163
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,080
Are you hiding something?

164
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,440
- Are you hiding something here?
- Dao, there's nothing in here.

165
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,920
Then just tell me the truth.

166
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,240
- Dao, let go.
- Why keep secrets?

167
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,000
I heard a rumor.

168
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,400
It's a ghost remedy, right?

169
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,960
That's why you can't tell me.

170
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,120
Leave me alone.

171
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,560
You ripped my nail.

172
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,080
Crazy bitch!

173
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,280
How come she's prettier?

174
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,960
Mmm.

175
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,240
Dao.

176
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,960
What are you up to?

177
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,000
Nothing, ma'am.

178
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,000
No, Dao!

179
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,680
You can't do that, sweetie.

180
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,480
Here. Press this on your wound.

181
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,320
Ma'am, I'm so sorry
that you and Dao will get home late today.

182
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,800
It's all right. These things happen.

183
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:53,120
Are you coming? The mall is still open.
I want to buy more foundation and serum.

184
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,240
Are you coming?

185
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,240
Wait, Dao!

186
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,880
ROOM FOR RENT. CALL MS. NOK.

187
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,320
NARINKARUNA BUILDING,
BENJADARASUKSA SCHOOL

188
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,280
Okay. Smile a little.
Right. Great. Very good.

189
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,120
This is the last set.

190
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,080
Three, two... Very nice.
Show your teeth a bit when you smile.

191
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,280
All right.

192
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,960
Mmm. Turn to the other side a bit.

193
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,440
Great.

194
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,520
Does the school need any more?

195
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,880
Well, we should have enough pictures.
Dao's one of the best in the business.

196
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,600
They'll want to use all her pictures.

197
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,200
She's done photo shoots
since middle school,

198
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,200
and now she's about to graduate.

199
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,120
OUTSTANDING STUDENTS, QUALITY CURRICULUM

200
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,120
- Thanks for your time today, Dao.
- No problem.

201
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,920
Excuse me.

202
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,320
Uh, would you mind
retouching my finger a bit?

203
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,120
You see,

204
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,560
I got bitten by a dog.

205
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,360
You know, something like this

206
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,000
really shouldn't happen
to a professional model.

207
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,040
Come on. I'm just joking.

208
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,400
Of course I can do it for you.

209
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,200
The look on your face...

210
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,120
- I'm sorry, sweetie.
- It's okay.

211
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,200
Dao's friend is beautiful too.

212
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,600
Now that we're done with Dao's shoot,
could you give us a little more time?

213
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:08,840
I want to create a profile for a girl
to submit to the agency.

214
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,600
Mmm, yes, of course.

215
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,520
But who might that be?

216
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,400
- Could it be...
- Yes.

217
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,920
Aim.

218
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,880
That's good.

219
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,720
- Smile like you do naturally.
- Okay.

220
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,360
That's good.
Just smile. Yes. Very good.

221
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,000
Relax, sweetie.

222
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,680
- Okay.
- Aim, I want to make you a star.

223
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,760
- I'll help you sign a contract.
- Okay.

224
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,600
Okay.
Turn to the left a little bit.

225
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,240
Yes. Good.

226
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,680
Sweetie?

227
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,440
- Hello?
- Aim.

228
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,696
- This way.
- Okay.

229
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,400
Look at the camera.

230
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,400
- Smile.
- Good.

231
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,600
Try a welcoming smile.

232
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,560
Okay, great.

233
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,000
You look very cute.

234
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,000
Nice.

235
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,600
Hey, don't you think Aim-Orn looks
more beautiful lately?

236
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,240
- Let's watch Aim-Orn's photo shoot.
- I'll come with you.

237
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:37,680
I think Aim-Orn will be a big star.
She's just so beautiful.

238
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,680
Yeah, I agree.

239
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,080
Bigger than Dao for sure.

240
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,880
Dao, what are you doing?
Are you going through Aim's things?

241
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,640
Did you find her beauty secret?
Let me know when you do.

242
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,920
What?

243
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,960
What do you mean by that?

244
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,080
Hey, you're being too harsh.

245
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,440
Look, I'm just kidding.
I heard that everyone says that about you.

246
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,440
You've been weird lately.

247
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,120
Hey, what's going on?

248
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,080
Let's take a look. Let's go.

249
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,520
Let's just go.

250
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,920
You're such a pain.

251
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,240
Wait, sweetie. What do you have in there?

252
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,680
Don't you see it's dripping everywhere?

253
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,760
I'm sorry.

254
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,240
I'd like to rent this room.

255
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,360
Okay.

256
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,800
Hey, guard!

257
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,440
Hurry and get a mop to clean this up!
Don't just stand there!

258
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,160
Yes, ma'am!

259
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,720
Damn.

260
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,680
What the hell?
She threw away perfectly good food.

261
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,640
Psycho bitch.

262
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,920
I'm not feeling well.

263
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,680
I'm going to sign up with an agency soon.

264
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,560
I'm so freaking happy.

265
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,840
My dream has almost come true.

266
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,280
How did I get pretty?

267
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,680
Sometimes, I'm not sure...

268
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,800
if the beauty I got is worth it.

269
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,520
But I'm getting used to it.

270
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,200
Yeah.

271
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,360
I'll go get something to eat.

272
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,080
Yeah.

273
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,280
A takeout.

274
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,200
What the hell is up with her?

275
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,120
What's wrong, sweetie?

276
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,040
Why are you lying here?

277
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,000
You must be drunk.

278
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,000
Shit!

279
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,280
Come on, open!

280
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,760
PLEASE STOP TRYING.
YOU SHOULDN'T KNOW. I'M WARNING YOU.

281
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,600
"Please stop trying."

282
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,560
"You shouldn't know."

283
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,160
"I'm warning you."

284
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,120
PLEASE STOP TRYING.
YOU SHOULDN'T KNOW. I'M WARNING YOU.

285
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,560
Hey!

286
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Dao.

287
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,480
Look at it!

288
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,360
See how badly this bitch insulted me.

289
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,000
Her true personality is freaking nasty,

290
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,920
but she pretends to be shy.

291
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,920
Why did you write
such things to insult Dao?

292
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,360
Isn't it her right
to choose whether to tell anyone?

293
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,640
- Hey!
- Hey!

294
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,520
- Dao!
- Wait!

295
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,480
Wait. Stop it. Enough.

296
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,160
- Hey!
- Stop it.

297
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,440
- Just let her go.
- Enough.

298
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,760
Stop, all of you.

299
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,200
And the two of you,

300
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,040
come to my office and calm down.

301
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,720
Let me remind you

302
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,160
that you two are the faces of our school.

303
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,000
Whatever you do,

304
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,560
don't let it ruin our image, all right?

305
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,600
As for you, Aim-Orn,

306
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,800
the alumna who's with the agency

307
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,880
is coming to sign you up tomorrow.

308
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,960
You should be mindful of your behavior.

309
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,280
It's your dream, isn't it?

310
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:38,600
Going forward, if there's a problem,
just talk about it nicely.

311
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,600
You're classmates.

312
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,520
Figure things out together.

313
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,680
MODEL SCHOOL, OUTSTANDING STUDENTS,
QUALITY CURRICULUM

314
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,480
You shouldn't stalk me, Dao.

315
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,160
You're the one
who almost ruined everything,

316
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
not me.

317
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,480
Why do you say that?

318
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,400
You're the one who always started it.

319
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,440
Then just tell me

320
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,440
what you did to get pretty.

321
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,280
Why is that so hard?

322
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,040
I can't do that, Dao.

323
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,320
I already told you that it's a curse.

324
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,480
If I tell you...

325
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,240
I'll lose everything.

326
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,520
I'd never let that happen.

327
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,520
If you don't tell me...

328
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,280
you'll lose the chance
to sign a contract for sure.

329
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,640
Think about it.

330
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,880
If I send this video to the agency,

331
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,160
<i>will they still want to sign
a freak like you?</i>

332
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,040
Can you promise me

333
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,160
that you'll keep everything secret?

334
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,360
So now you can tell me?

335
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,480
What about this stupid curse?

336
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,440
Is it gone now?

337
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,160
The curse hasn't changed.

338
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,360
I still can't tell you.

339
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,360
But I'll show you

340
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,920
what I have to become

341
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,440
and how I earn what I have today.

342
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,920
Then you might change your mind.

343
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,120
You underestimate me.

344
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,600
Hurry up!

345
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,920
About the dead cat...

346
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,640
I ate it.

347
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,320
I'll go get something to eat.

348
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,120
Yeah.

349
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,480
A takeout.

350
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,120
Bye for now.

351
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,400
Well,

352
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,040
if that's a condition of the curse...

353
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,640
I understand

354
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,320
that it might be difficult.

355
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,280
But if you can do it,

356
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,560
well, so can I.

357
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,720
Well, open it.

358
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,320
Shit!

359
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,160
It freaking stinks.

360
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,360
This rotten odor...

361
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,240
has become a pleasant smell to me.

362
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,320
Really?

363
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,200
It isn't so bad, then.

364
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,360
In fact,

365
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,680
it will make my life easier.

366
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,360
Well, go inside.

367
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,320
Get in.

368
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,560
You're actually much worse than I thought.

369
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,160
Where is the secret?

370
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,600
If you don't tell me...

371
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,560
I'll share this video
and show the whole world

372
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,520
that the state of your room

373
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,280
and the way you look

374
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,760
are complete opposites.

375
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,360
It started with me

376
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,840
wanting to be beautiful like you.

377
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,480
Now, every night,
I have to eat rotten things,

378
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,640
like what you saw.

379
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,960
I can see that, obviously.
It's all over the room.

380
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,840
Are there other conditions?

381
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,360
Yes, there are.

382
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,200
You can't tell anyone the secret.

383
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,080
I already know that.

384
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,240
You keep repeating that. It's so annoying.

385
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,000
Keeping it a secret is good, though,

386
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,360
because I don't want anyone
to be prettier than me.

387
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,240
There are more conditions, Dao.

388
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,920
They're written on the label
of the drink you're looking for.

389
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,960
I messed up.

390
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,160
I drank it without reading the label.

391
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,040
<i>"Penanggalan."</i>

392
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,640
<i>What is it?</i>

393
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,560
Point to it.

394
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,400
Tell me where it is.

395
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,400
Tell me now.

396
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,880
Tell me now!

397
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,600
Where is it?

398
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,480
Why the hell won't you tell me?

399
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,480
Where is it?

400
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,200
Just point to where it is.

401
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,320
Why the hell won't you tell me? Tell me.

402
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,400
Where is it?

403
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,280
Did you fall?

404
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,520
Is that what I hear every night?

405
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,480
Do you go crazy every night, you psycho?

406
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,840
Are you really coughing?

407
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,840
I thought you were throwing up
to try to lose weight.

408
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,760
There you go again.

409
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,840
Do I just drink it?

410
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:12,920
You freaky bitch.

411
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,600
Here we go.

412
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,760
To become more beautiful,
I'm willing to do anything.

413
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,720
Let's see

414
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,600
how beautiful I'll be.

415
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,800
Let's see...

416
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,960
...if it works in a heartbeat.

417
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,240
Let me see.

418
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,600
What the fuck are you?

419
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,280
What did you give me to drink?

420
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,080
You drank it, right?

421
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,880
Now I can tell you the secret.

422
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,160
What you just drank...

423
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,280
WHAT IS PENANGGALAN?

424
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:23,800
...was our saliva.

425
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,200
KRASUE, A FLESH-EATING SPIRIT

426
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:37,920
Did you...

427
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:41,240
Did you kill people
then eat their raw flesh?

428
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,840
No.

429
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,320
I don't eat it right away.

430
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,280
It has to rot nicely first.

431
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,520
From now on,

432
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,200
your nose will tell you

433
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,080
what you can eat

434
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,880
and what you can't.

435
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,000
Hey, sweetheart.

436
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:22,360
What are you doing in there so loudly?

437
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:25,000
Why is it louder than usual
in there today?

438
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,560
Sweetie.

439
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,280
I smell a baby.

440
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:51,520
Sweetie.
