Oh, did you watch
the livestream last night?

15

What happened? Spill it.

16
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,640
It's Mint from Class Two.
She was raving on Facebook,

17
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,400
saying someone was going to kill her,
and then the livestream got cut off.

18
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,960
That attention seeker must've had a fight
with her boyfriend as usual.

19
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,760
Bitch, if she heard you
say that, she'd be mad at you for sure.

20
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,520
You think I'm afraid of her? Come at me.

21

Yeah.

22

Hey.

43
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,840
I heard the teachers checked
the school's security cameras,

44
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,240
and it looked like Mint was alone.

45
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,880
Plus, they saw Mint jumping on her own.

46
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,680
Why would Mint kill herself?

47

Yes. Why?

No, don't bother.

63
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,240
I would if you didn't stop me.

00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,040
Oh, right.

65
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,720
Everyone in my class
was talking about Mint today.

66
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,080
It's so shocking.

67
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,400
I walked past her yesterday.

68
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,360
I watched the video from the livestream.

69
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's so scary.

70
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,160
You watched it?

71
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,360
I didn't dare.
My friends said it was horrifying.

72
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,840
If this scares you,
how can you be a horror film director?

73
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,000
It's not the same, my dear Pleng.

74
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,280
I guess that's true,

75
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,360
since even cuties like me
can write scripts for horror plays.

76
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,320
Yeah.

77
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,040
You really are cute.

78
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,520
We need to finish.

79
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,800
You mean the script?

80
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,040
Yeah.

81
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,960
All right. I won't tease you anymore.

82
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,600
I'm off to the bathroom, okay?

83
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,640
Boy, can we take a picture with you?

84
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,200
Sure.

85
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,360
Thank you.

94

Come here.

95
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,160
Don't try to win me over.
You're sleeping outside tonight.

96
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,680
Bad dog.

97
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,480
All right, just this once.
But that doesn't mean I'm not mad anymore.

98
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,920
Want some?

99
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,880
Don't make that face.

100
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,920
I brought flowers for Mint.

101
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,160
Oh, the other day, I saw you with Boy.

102
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,560
Do you like him?

103
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,800
Why? Do you like him too?

104
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,680
Or are you going to steal someone I like
just like your friend stole my boyfriend?

105
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,320
Don't talk shit about my friend.

106
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,280
How lucky for Mint

107
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,120
that her best friend's defending her.

108
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,480
You know what?

109
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,280
You're boring.

110
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,560
That's why Sun got tired of you

111
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,360
and went to my friend.

Oh.

113
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,800
There's one more thing.

It's a secret, actually.

If you want the script, check your email.

I sent you everything.

Wait, Pleng, Pleng, Pleng, Pleng.

175
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,680
What's wrong? You didn't pick up my calls.

176
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,360
You didn't text me back either.

177
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,440
Is there a problem?

178
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,560
I don't have one.

179
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,400
But you do.

180
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,480
What's wrong?

181
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,080
You have a girlfriend.

No, I don't.

183
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,400
It's Jinnie.

184
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,560
Why did you lie to me?

185
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,640
Hold on, Pleng.

186
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,840
Jin is actually my little sister.

187
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,080
She's my sibling.

188
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,800
Why have we never heard of her?

189
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,400
There are no pictures
of you together on social media.

190
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,080
Jin wouldn't let me post them.

191
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,920
She said that her man
might get the wrong idea.

192
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,920
Jin is always like this.

193
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,560
Last time, she stirred up trouble
with my female friends too.

194
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,880
My friends almost dumped me.

195
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,480
Wait a minute.

196
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,600
Pleng, how do you know my sister Jinnie?

197
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,040
We went to the same cram school.

198
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,120
We didn't get along.

199
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,360
Oh, so that's what happened.

200
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,160
Now that you know the truth,

201
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,000
can you stop being mad at me?

202
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,240
Are you still mad?

203
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,800
Oh.

204
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,600
Perhaps you're not mad after all.

205
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,960
Are you jealous?

206
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,560
No.

207
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,720
I'm not that close to Jinnie,

208
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,280
so I didn't know you were siblings.

209
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,840
How was I to know
I'd be messed with like this?

210
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,440
Well, that's that.

211
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,480
I believe you're not jealous.

212
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,840
So, what are you doing in here?

213
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,600
I don't feel like going to my last class.

214
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,840
To be honest,

215
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,440
when I walk past this room,

216
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,440
it always sends shivers down my spine. I...

217
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,920
Because you're afraid of ghosts.

218
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,960
No way.

219
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,160
Who's afraid?

220
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,640
Not me.

221
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,200
There's nothing to be afraid of.

222
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,080
Mmm. Don't you know this room's story?

223
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,760
They say

224
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,920
the students in this class

225
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,040
all died

226
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,320
because of a classmate's curse.

227
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,560
And that person killed herself afterwards.

228
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,680
Then the room was kept locked

229
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,080
and turned into a storage room,
as you can see.

230
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,960
But...

231
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,920
isn't that

232
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,400
the plot of the play that you wrote?

233
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,960
Yeah.

234
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,760
It is.

235
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,200
Well, I used this story for inspiration.

236
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,560
Well.

237
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,680
I don't have any more classes.
Should we go get some food?

238
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,200
Are you buying?
I don't have any money left.

239
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,600
Okay.

240
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,120
Then let me go get my things first.

241
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,600
Why don't you stay here
until the traffic is less busy?

242
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,320
Okay.

243
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,120
Is no one home?

244
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,320
Yeah.

245
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,760
My mom's out of town for work.
She isn't back yet.

246
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,840
I see.

247
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,960
So...

248
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,240
are you an only child?

249
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,080
I played alone when I was little.
It was kind of lonely.

250
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,480
It would've been nice
to have a brother like you.

251
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,160
Are you and Jinnie close?

252
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,760
Yesterday,

253
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,120
I didn't know what was up with her.

254
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,560
She locked herself in her room
and wouldn't eat anything.

255
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,400
It's going to be okay, Boy.

256
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,320
I'm sure she'll be better soon.

257
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,840
Thank you so much, Pleng.

258
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
When I'm with you,

259
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,720
I feel so at ease.

260

00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,120

What the hell?

265
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,200
Why did you write Jinnie's name?

266
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,320
Boy, calm down.

267
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,480
It's nothing, Boy.

268
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,880
Then why did you write it?

269
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,320
