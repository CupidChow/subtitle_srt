=Episode 19=

30
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,400
You destroyed Jingkou Village.

31
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,150
You left them with no hope.

32
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:30,040
Is this your so-called standing firm?

33
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,040
Their pain at this very moment

34
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:33,960
is because of you.

35
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:35,150
You

36
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,560
are the real culprit.

37
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,200
Before you arrived,

38
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,680
this little one came over,

39
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,430
looking pitiful.

40
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,310
So I gave it a bite to eat.

41
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,490
It grew quite close to me.

42
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,860
If even livestock are like that,

43
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,870
how much more so would a man be?

44
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,760
The common folk toil from dawn to dusk,

45
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:06,000
yet can barely scrape by.

46
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,310
They believe what they wish to believe.

47
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,030
Is that really wrong?

48
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,280
They've done nothing wrong.

49
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,030
They were simply deceived.

50
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,750
The fault lies with the deceivers.

51
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,910
You've been searching for this,

52
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,080
haven't you?

53
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,520
Why is the Qilin with you?

54
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,470
Because I am Li Nvxu,

55
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,590
Lan'er in your eyes,

56
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,870
and the Mistress in their words.

57
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,440
So it was you all along.

58
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,080
It was me.

59
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,400
If you and I join hands,

60
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,160
then after it's done,

61
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,160
this Qilin will be yours.

62
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,710
What is it you wish for?

63
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,280
And what schemes are you after?

64
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,380
You're finally awake.

65
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,310
It's like I died and came back.

66
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,130
You've been out cold for two days.

67
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,020
What time is it now?

68
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,220
What… what time?

69
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,030
Wang, perfect timing you woke.

70
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:08,900
Qingge.

71
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,400
Why are you here?

72
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:11,910
Wang, you're still half-dreaming.

73
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,050
Where else would I be?

74
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,390
Hurry, the Duke is coming back.

75
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,520
The Duke?

76
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:17,660
Where did the Duke go?

77
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,100
He went to see Huo Guang,
as you planned.

78
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,400
Huo Guang… Chang'an...

79
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,800
Uncle and the others have arrived.

80
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,010
Ren Xuan?

81
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,190
What is going on?

82
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:28,990
How come I don't know?

83
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,210
Before you passed out,

84
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,430
you said to lure Huo Guang here today

85
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,280
and then end him.

86
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,160
What?

87
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,310
You left my marital uncle
with no resting peace.

88
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,750
You ruined his lifetime of honor.

89
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,170
Today, I'll avenge him.

90
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,030
You caused the heroes
of Wucheng Village to perish.

91
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,360
The ground ran red with blood.

92
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,590
You are the one to blame.

93
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,860
The brothers of Changyi died due to you.

94
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,120
I will avenge them as well.

95
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,870
Not me, it wasn't me.

96
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,840
Wang.

97
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,570
The Duke treated you so well,
why would you...?

98
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:16,770
Why?

99
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,480
All because of your selfish desires.

100
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,430
No, I didn't. I'm innocent.

101
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,330
Yes.

102
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,140
Everyone died because of you.

103
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,090
Go up.

104
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,320
Who are you?

105
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,990
Are you one of Huo Guang's men?

106
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,160
Do you truly believe

107
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,610
it was Huo Guang who killed them?

108
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,680
Are you with Li Nvxu?

109
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,630
Not that either.

110
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,600
Then who are you really?

111
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,390
The one behind it all.

112
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,000
Whose orders are you following?

113
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,160
The Mandate of Heaven.

114
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,430
Who are you, truly?

115
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,980
Who told Liu He that he must do

116
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,070
all those absurd things for a chance?

117
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:12,210
Who sent Ren Xuan
to gather his brothers and leave

118
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,230
the village to aid?

119
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,400
And who, in the end,

120
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,070
led all the brothers of Changyi
to Wucheng Village?

121
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,050
It's me, Wang Heng.

122
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,480
Because only I know the Mandate of Heaven.

123
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:29,480
Only Wang Heng could cause
everyone's death.

124
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,390
Who are you, really?

125
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,240
Why do you look exactly like me?

126
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,240
Look like?

127
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,600
I am you.

128
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,120
You are not me.

129
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,720
I am you.

130
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,370
And you are me.

131
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,400
If you don't die,
how can you kill me?

132
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,120
It was us who took their lives.

133
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,390
Only with one death

134
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,000
can we face them with honor.

135
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,750
The one to blame.

136
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,650
Kill, kill, kill.

137
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,510
The one to blame.

138
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:14,330
Kill, kill, kill.

139
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,280
The one to blame.

140
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,360
Kill, kill, kill.

141
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,950
The one to blame.

142
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:25,250
Kill, kill, kill!

143
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,310
The one to blame.

144
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,320
Kill, kill, kill!

145
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,050
Yes.

146
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:39,630
Only death can bring justice for them.

147
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:45,900
Heng.

148
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,880
Heng, Heng!

149
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,480
Quickly,

150
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,460
catch Lan'er.

151
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,430
She is Li Nvxu.

152
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,340
She is the Mistress.

153
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,950
Capture any suspicious woman nearby.

154
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,070
- Medicine.
- Get it.

155
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,680
Why are you so late?

156
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,950
A strange mist suddenly appeared.

157
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,120
I lost my way.

158
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:11,920
Did you catch Li Qi?

159
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,400
No.

160
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,140
Scalp Wang was mesmerized by him.

161
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,630
The citywide search is ongoing.

162
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,310
The one behind Li Qi is Lan'er.

163
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,200
What?

164
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,230
Could it be love turned to hate?

165
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,490
Unrequited love, perhaps.

166
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:30,760
I need some water.

167
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:31,800
Alright.

168
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,940
Let's go.

169
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,150
Slow down.

170
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:52,360
Our plan to lure the enemy out worked.

171
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:53,430
How can you be so sure?

172
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,170
They've plotted this move
for over a decade.

173
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,380
Very cautious, every step.

174
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:01,740
At your mansion,
they found no chance to act.

175
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,360
So they tried to divide us

176
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,480
and strike one by one.

177
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,510
I see.

178
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,040
Marquis,

179
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,800
Lord Sun warned this place is dangerous.

180
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,750
Return to the mansion.

181
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,890
- Alright.
- Okay.

182
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,190
Go.

183
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,830
That way.

184
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,950
Report. Nothing over there.

185
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,900
Search that side next.

186
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:21,750
Yes.

187
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,480
Lord Wang, Marquis.

188
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,070
Lord Sun.

189
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,000
Lan'er is the Xiqiang woman, Li Nvxu.

190
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,170
The Mistress they spoke of.

191
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,600
The true mastermind behind it all.

192
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,630
Make sure she and Li Qi are brought in.

193
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,670
Beware of Mishenfu.

194
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,440
Someone dares to frame you.

195
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,610
I'll find her, no matter what.

196
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,080
Men! With me!

197
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,920
Yes.

198
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,390
That way.

199
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,890
After they're caught,

200
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,870
will the truth behind Wucheng Village,

201
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,080
Mishenfu,

202
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,840
Xiqiang spies all be revealed?

203
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,350
There must be a greater force
behind this.

204
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,310
No matter what, this time,

205
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,740
I won't let you take risks again.

206
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,080
Rest assured.

207
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,030
If things are as I said,

208
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,480
then it's beyond
what you and I can face.

209
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,910
I will inform His Majesty at once.

210
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,150
Let him take care of this.

211
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,080
That would be best.

212
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,100
Just now,

213
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,570
I came to realize a few things.

214
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,680
What things?

215
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,670
What I truly value most.

216
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,200
And what is that?

217
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,550
High rank, wealth,

218
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,150
fame, and prestige.

219
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,080
Wang Heng!

220
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,430
None of these truly matter.

221
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,840
Then what matters?

222
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,930
You and I are still buddies.

223
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,600
That's what truly counts.

224
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,770
(Records from the Book of Han,)

225
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,920
(Yuankang Year 4,
under Emperor Xuan of Han,)

226
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,830
(envoys were sent to tour the realm)

227
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,390
(to observe the lives of the people)

228
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,590
(and seek out the talents.)

229
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,300
(That year and the following year,)

230
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:51,250
(titles and gifts were granted.)

231
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,270
(Land taxes were remitted
in places he passed,)

232
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,760
(revealing his will
to let the people prosper.)

233
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,910
(Emperor Xuan of Han went incognito
to Haihun.)

234
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,240
After entering the city, De Jiu,

235
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,030
you go meet the patrol officers first.

236
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,900
Have them arrange the journey reports.

237
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,510
When I arrive, I'll hear them.

238
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:08,880
Yes, Your Majesty.

239
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:17,590
Morning, Marquis.

240
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,490
I was just about to visit you.

241
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,220
What's going on?

242
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,720
A distinguished guest came by today.

243
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,200
He booked my entire tea stall.

244
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,360
Marquis, Marquis!

245
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:31,990
Kang Ning.

246
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,040
Kang.

247
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:34,740
Qi Chang.

248
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,840
Qi.

249
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,430
- Please.
- Please.

250
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,160
Kang.

251
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,340
It's been years.

252
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,180
Where's your sword?

253
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,080
Have you taken a new path of chivalry?

254
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:55,360
You still remember
what I said back then.

255
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,400
Of course, I remember.

256
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,720
The folk heroes

257
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,790
care about right from wrong.

258
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,630
The court heroes

259
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,150
care about the people.

260
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:08,840
I suppose you've served in the court.

261
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:11,350
The court is another kind
of martial world.

262
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,360
It's not only about the clash of swords,

263
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:18,870
but a battle of hearts.

264
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,510
Come on.

265
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,120
Have some tea.

266
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:33,840
I thought we'd never meet again.

267
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,670
When will we meet again?

268
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:40,480
Where will we meet again?

269
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,080
It's all in Heaven's hands.

270
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,640
But our bond is like this tea.

271
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,940
Though we drink from different cups,

272
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,710
it's poured from the same pot.

273
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,540
One source, flowing apart.

274
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,120
Blood ties bind us.

275
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,080
They cannot be severed.

276
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,200
All my life, I've achieved little.

277
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,960
Yet Kang, you never turned away

278
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,970
and still share a pot of tea with me.

279
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:11,760
I speak from the heart,

280
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,520
that's my greatest fortune.

281
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,410
Have some tea.

282
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,830
Life is still long.

283
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,000
Let the past be.

284
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,750
Fear not the future.

285
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,940
Let's speak of the present.

286
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,000
A cup of tea,

287
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,080
an old friend,

288
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,160
that's enough.

289
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,750
Kang.

290
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:36,330
The Great Han grows stronger by the day.

291
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:39,230
Please tell His Majesty
on behalf of me, a humble citizen,

292
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,080
he is open-minded

293
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,650
and full of wisdom within.

294
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,350
A true enlightened ruler.

295
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,230
I shall convey it without fail.

296
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:52,510
This is also what the Marquis
wishes to tell His Majesty.

297
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,030
The Marquis and I are on friendly terms.

298
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,320
He

299
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:01,900
always ends up drunk.

300
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,600
When he drinks too much,
he stares at the sky.

301
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,630
Not a single word said.

302
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,910
That day, he emptied all jars
in the wine shop,

303
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,280
drunk beyond reason.

304
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,940
He couldn't even stand straight.

305
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,020
I had to carry him back myself.

306
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:21,550
When he lay on my back,
he started rambling.

307
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,670
He said…

308
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,640
the throne was never what he sought.

309
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,260
He was unfit for it.

310
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:35,330
But he wished to return to Chang'an
to honor his ancestors.

311
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,300
Other than that…

312
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,360
he had no further desires.

313
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:54,200
His Majesty once spoke of his uncle.

314
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,840
What exactly did he say?

315
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:01,940
He wished the Marquis
could enjoy cockfights

316
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:03,500
and horse races in Haihun,

317
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:07,480
to live a carefree life
that belonged to Liu Bingyi.

318
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,600
Kang.

319
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,560
Qi.

320
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:15,920
I have matters to do.

321
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,110
Until we meet again some day.

322
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,220
I hope

323
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,320
we truly meet again one day.

324
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,680
Remember to address him Lord Kang later.

325
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,040
Lord Kang.

326
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,480
I wonder if he'll be pleased
with these arrangements.

327
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:44,080
Sometimes no plan is the best plan.

328
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,720
Lord Kang.

329
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,560
We were unaware of your arrival.

330
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,750
Please forgive us

331
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,600
for not greeting you sooner.

332
00:14:58,930 --> 00:14:59,780
Lord Kang.

333
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,910
I have prepared a carriage for you.

334
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,200
I wish to accompany you to tour Haihun.

335
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,880
So you've set my schedule for me.

336
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,940
You shouldn't trouble yourself
with travel matters.

337
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,990
Such duties are my responsibility.

338
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,290
Lord Sun,

339
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,860
I'm here on a royal incognito inspection

340
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:24,870
for the purpose of

341
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,130
seeing how the people of Haihun live.

342
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,520
You make all the arrangements for me.

343
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,550
Then how can I know the truth?

344
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,720
Forgive my rudeness,
I spoke out of turn.

345
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,150
I spoke out of turn.

346
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,840
Alright, I'll have a look around.

347
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,220
No need to follow me.

348
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,780
(Common Joy Market)

349
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,780
- Your...
- Thank you.

350
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:06,750
Heng.

351
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:09,200
This is a private tour in disguise.

352
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,030
For now, just call me Kang Ning.

353
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,360
No need for so much formality between us.

354
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,080
I figured you would be here by now.

355
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,030
And that the first thing you would do

356
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,670
is come to see this Common Joy Market.

357
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,880
The name of this market is well chosen.

358
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,920
Joy of the people.

359
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,350
Sharing joy with the people.

360
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:31,020
Heng, don't you wish for me to come here?

361
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,050
Kang, you can't be serious.

362
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,040
I wouldn't dare.

363
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,750
I'm only worried
the journey might tire you.

364
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:45,600
Would you care to
stroll with me in the market?
