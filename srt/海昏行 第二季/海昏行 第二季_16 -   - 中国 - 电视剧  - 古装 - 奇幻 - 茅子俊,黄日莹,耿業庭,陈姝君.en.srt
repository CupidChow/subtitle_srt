=Episode 16=

30
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,930
Imperial Guard Commander Wang Heng,
receive the decree.

31
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,680
See for yourself.

32
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,510
State affairs are beyond my rank.

33
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,460
Decree to Commander Heng
of the Huben Army,

34
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,870
I am mindful of spies from Xiqiang
sneaking into Yuzhang,

35
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,070
hearing that you investigated in person,

36
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:50,950
exerting great effort.

37
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,790
I'm deeply gratified.

38
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,000
I send this decree to ask about it.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,120
How is the progress?

40
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,120
Have you uncovered their plot

41
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,480
or capture the traitor?

42
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,040
I know you are skilled in such affairs.

43
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,100
Your prestige is unmatched.

44
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,220
Thus, return to Chang'an at once,

45
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,200
take command of the army,

46
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:07,470
and march against Xiqiang.

47
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,280
I hope you will not fail my expectations.

48
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,200
Sweep away the rebels.

49
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,250
Bring peace to the people.

50
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,120
Show the might of the Great Han.

51
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,240
Moreover,

52
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,870
we have been apart for long.

53
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,110
My longing for you

54
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,360
is beyond words.

55
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,090
Once you receive this decree,

56
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,060
return without delay.

57
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,300
I wish to see you in person

58
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,040
and discuss affairs of the realm.

59
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,070
I can continue investigating

60
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,770
Xiqiang spies with Lord Sun.

61
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,960
The realm faces troubles

62
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,200
and you should reply.

63
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,400
Reply on my behalf.

64
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:36,590
To what?

65
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:38,850
The letter, of course.

66
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,310
Write back whatever you see

67
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,020
and whatever comes to mind.

68
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,500
In my voice, as if I spoke it.

69
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:47,990
Bring the brush

70
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,960
and the ink.

71
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,010
Your Majesty,

72
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,400
I traveled in secret to gather news.

73
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,870
Roaming across Yuzhang,

74
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,030
I saw the common folk suffering.

75
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,470
My heart remained heavy.

76
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,700
Women clutching children fled in panic.

77
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,720
They had nothing to eat.

78
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,960
Cries of misery echoed.

79
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,150
It was heartbreaking to witness.

80
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,400
The magistrate lost
in folly and neglect,

81
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,520
imposing excessive and arbitrary taxes,

82
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,700
leaving people in misery.

83
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,040
(A cute young man; a fine match for me.)
There were

84
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,470
corrupt schemers who fabricated

85
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,670
false charges upon the people,

86
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,310
driving them into hard labor.

87
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,470
The people were treated like slaves.

88
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,330
Such acts are beyond outrage.

89
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,800
These officials

90
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,530
showed no care for the people's plight

91
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,280
and shielded each other from blame,

92
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,810
treating the common folk like weeds.

93
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,630
I was met with obstruction

94
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,610
while speaking out for the people.

95
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,310
The voice of justice cannot spread.

96
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,230
All these strange occurrences

97
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,190
bear traces of Xiqiang people.

98
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,620
What's more,

99
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,470
there is a sorceress from Xiqiang

100
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,760
who beguiles the people

101
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,080
with deceitful words.

102
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,710
The common folk lose their true nature

103
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,590
and follow twisted beliefs blindly.

104
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,900
Truly a sorrow for the world.

105
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,100
Yet I have not captured the mastermind.

106
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,200
Could these culprits
be spies of Xiqiang?

107
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,110
No solid proof is yet in my hands.

108
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:25,320
Thus, I choose to stay in Haihun
with Liu He,

109
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,810
to continue hunting the mastermind,

110
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,840
to uphold Your Majesty's benevolent rule,

111
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,300
to govern well,

112
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,560
to save people,

113
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:35,960
to lighten taxes,

114
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,390
and to grant people peace.

115
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,970
So with all hearts united,

116
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,220
we forge the Great Han's era.

117
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,480
(Wang Heng)
When the truth is revealed,

118
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,970
I shall return to court.

119
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,640
Heng.

120
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,460
Then how can we reveal the truth?

121
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,470
Melody, rhythm,

122
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,520
rock.

123
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,840
Milords, forgive my late welcome.

124
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,310
I heard you came
under His Majesty's command

125
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,160
to show care for the vulnerable

126
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,310
observe local customs and ways,

127
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,180
examine the governance of the officials,

128
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,200
and discover and recommend worthy talents.

129
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,390
I shall give my utmost effort

130
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:18,920
to serve at your disposal.

131
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,310
Much obliged, Lord Sun.

132
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,320
Lord Sun.

133
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,070
Madam Qingge.

134
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,360
It has been too long.

135
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:30,710
Where is the Marquis?

136
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,580
Well...

137
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,720
La la la la la.

138
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:37,120
La la la la.

139
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,880
Stop.

140
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,040
That doesn't feel rock and roll enough.

141
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,070
Then how should I rock and roll

142
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,240
to reach your standard?

143
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,310
Good question.

144
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,920
It really gets to the heart of the band.

145
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:56,360
Rock and roll is about letting loose.

146
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,530
Speak straight from the heart.

147
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,660
Ahem.

148
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:07,920
La la la la la la la la.

149
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,330
This just got worse.

150
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:14,080
La la la la la la la la.

151
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,750
Qingge, when did you get back?

152
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,260
Looks like you're having fun

153
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,290
while I was away.

154
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,240
Just in time to join our band.

155
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,370
Let's go over there.

156
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:26,370
This one looks nice.

157
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,070
A touch of red on the branch.

158
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,920
A few wishes on the cloth.

159
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,780
This is the check-in spot
Heng had in mind.

160
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,320
The check-in spot?

161
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,600
Lately, you've been picking up

162
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,070
quite a few new words from Wang.

163
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,680
I don't know well.

164
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,080
All I know is a single red cord

165
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,520
and a piece of silk cloth
can carry a wish.

166
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,460
Sir, I'll take this one.

167
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,390
Is Lord Yan in good health?

168
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,880
Safe and sound.

169
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,430
He's commanded to march against Xiqiang.

170
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,770
He's preparing for it.

171
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,270
He is a straightforward man.

172
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:09,040
Tell him not to let pride guide him
on the battlefield.

173
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,430
He's changed quite a bit.

174
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,040
With the passing years,

175
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,350
he's grown gentler.

176
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:19,000
We talked till dawn when I returned.

177
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,630
It felt like we made up
for all the years of silence.

178
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,510
It's truly wonderful.

179
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,480
Truly wonderful.

180
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,070
I mean it.

181
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,070
Come, take a look at my wishing tree.

182
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,430
It's quite magical.

183
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,900
Is this tree enchanted?

184
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,650
We'll know once we try.

185
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,260
Welcome.

186
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:52,240
Write your wishes on this cloth strip.

187
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,240
Then hang it on the tree.

188
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,910
Your wishes will surely come true.

189
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:01,630
No peeking.

190
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,080
May the Great Han prosper

191
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,310
and Lord Yan return victorious.

192
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,400
What about yours?

193
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,720
Mine's the same.

194
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,150
And may all of us

195
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,300
gather again in Chang'an.

196
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,800
Oh, right.

197
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,590
You must join our band.

198
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:50,960
Rock.

199
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,580
Rock?

200
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,390
(Melon: Summer Music)

201
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,790
All ticket holders

202
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,150
get one free painting session.

203
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,390
Guard your gold and silver well.

204
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,580
Such a grand scene.

205
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,200
As if it's the equine administration.

206
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,400
Be cautious in correspondence.

207
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,700
Quite alike.

208
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,790
I'll take a look over there.

209
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,080
Double-check before paying.

210
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,170
Wait for me, Li.

211
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,040
There's no free pie from heaven.

212
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:10,990
Come here.

213
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:14,020
Only traps descend from above.

214
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,000
We have it all.

215
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,650
Riches are never easily gained.

216
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:21,240
Always stay alert and never forget.

217
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,720
Did you hear that clearly?

218
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,840
Say it again.

219
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:28,120
Keep family matters hidden.

220
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,590
Guard your gold and silver well.

221
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,270
Be cautious in correspondence.

222
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:38,960
(Do not mistake him; Lord Sun is here)
Double-check before paying.

223
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,990
Next,

224
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,750
The Voyage to Haihun Band

225
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,200
will present a song for you all,

226
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,840
"Bewitching Incense is Poisonous".

227
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,750
Great!

228
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,120
Friends,

229
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,480
remember the hand sign
I just taught you?

230
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,790
Wow, oh, oh.

231
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,360
I can already feel your excitement.

232
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,260
So next,

233
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,840
we hand the stage
to the Voyage to Haihun.

234
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,200
Let's fire it up!

235
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,410
Oh, oh, oh.

236
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,680
What are you doing?

237
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:15,680
Hurry up.

238
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,960
I'm nervous...

239
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,550
It's a small gig.

240
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,730
What's a Marquis got to fear?

241
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:20,600
Come on.

242
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,260
Sing, come on, sing.

243
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,420
Give us one, give us one!

244
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,960
Are they scarier than Huo Guang?

245
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,800
You can do it.

246
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,630
Come on.

247
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:34,240
Sing, sing!

248
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:35,590
Alright.

249
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,730
Let's go.

250
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:39,020

284

Rock and roll never dies.

285
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:07,690
He suddenly collapsed.

286
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,960
Is this how rock and roll he is?

287
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,440
Good thing I made it back in time.

288
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,630
Or else…

289
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,200
He's going to be fine.

290
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,790
He's hardly gotten sick since childhood.

291
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,910
This sudden fainting

292
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,390
must be the aftereffects of poisoning.

293
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,080
It's my fault, I was too careless.

294
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,750
This has nothing to do with you.

295
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,030
Don't blame yourself.

296
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,870
I'm the one who knows him best.

297
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,170
So well I can tell his mood
from his first word.

298
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,750
One step from him
and I know where he's going.

299
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,560
Someone poisoned him,

300
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,010
yet I didn't notice a single thing.

301
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,110
I even thought
it was his bottled-up grief.

302
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,360
That's what everyone thinks

303
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:54,120
because he's been through a lot.

304
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,090
We know each other too well.

305
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,750
So well that day after day,

306
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,600
the spark we once felt
have faded away.

307
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,670
What's left is a self-assured sense
of knowing.

308
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,630
Sometimes I wonder,

309
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,480
between the Marquis and me,

310
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,350
is it truly love that binds us

311
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,790
or simply the habit of kinship?

312
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,750
Whether it's love or kinship,

313
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,380
it's an affection.

314
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,000
Right now, you stay by each other's side.

315
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,370
That's the most precious thing.

316
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,700
The Marquis has been too weary lately

317
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,100
and got emotional.

318
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,340
You need not worry.

319
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,790
De Jiu,

320
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,790
after spending so much time with Wang,

321
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,480
you've learned to comfort people.

322
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,290
And you?

323
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,860
How are things between you two?

324
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,870
Has he confessed his feelings yet?

325
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,910
To him,

326
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,000
we're just comrades-in-arms.

327
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,570
And to you?

328
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,120
Master has raised me since childhood.

329
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,960
Without Master, there would be no me.

330
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,600
The duty entrusted by Master and Uncle

331
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,120
is to protect Crown Prince's bloodline.

332
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,440
Not only have I failed in my duty,

333
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,370
but I dragged His Majesty into helping.

334
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,120
Now Xiqiang are invading,

335
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,270
and the borders are in peril.

336
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,440
If I can't help His Majesty
restore peace,

337
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,150
how can I speak of matters of the heart?

338
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,180
De Jiu,

339
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,790
just follow your heart.

340
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,240
I'm glad you came back this time.

341
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,440
Usually I only see them chattering away.

342
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:36,550
Now, I have someone I can truly talk to.

343
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:38,630
Madam.

344
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:39,830
Madam.

345
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,200
His Lordship is awake.

346
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:42,710
Let's go.

347
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:45,570
Your hand.

348
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,780
Don't worry, it's fine.

349
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,120
You're all here.

350
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,680
Marquis.

351
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,750
What I'm going to say next

352
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,780
is of great importance.

353
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,150
Why does it sound like a last will?

354
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,680
I know my own body

355
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,720
better than anyone.

356
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,920
Heng.

357
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:46,440
Please write down everything I say.

358
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,920
These are things to be buried with me.

359
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,220
It can't be that bad.

360
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:56,670
Marquis.

361
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,080
In my lifetime

362
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,750
I've achieved little of real merit.

363
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,600
But I wish to try another way.

364
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,280
A way to give this world

365
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,020
something to remember me by.

366
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,630
These burial treasures

367
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,760
are from me, Liu He.

368
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:25,630
They're the only mark
I can leave on history.

369
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,160
Heng,

370
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,240
can you understand how I feel?

371
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,310
Alright, alright.

372
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,450
I'll write it down for you, every bit.

373
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,510
First on the list,

374
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,200
the ink-inscribed gold ingot.

375
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,790
