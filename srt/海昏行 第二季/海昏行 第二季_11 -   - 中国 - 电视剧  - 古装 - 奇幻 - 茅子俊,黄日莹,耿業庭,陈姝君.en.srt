30
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,970
It's all because of that Luo fellow.

31
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:27,890
Now we can't even afford a meal.

32
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:28,790
Exactly.

33
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,200
Everyone, head on back.

34
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,330
The Governor's troops will see you home.

35
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:35,990
Much obliged, milord.

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,410
Thank you, Marquis.

37
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,830
Come on, let's go.

38
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,330
At last, we can go home.

39
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,470
Mishenfu has ruined countless lives.

40
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,590
How dare you escort such a deadly thing!

41
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,680
Who ordered you to do this?

42
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:50,790
And what was your intent?

43
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,270
I...

44
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,680
I dare not speak.

45
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,890
Was it Mistress who's behind this?

46
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,870
Milord, no one guided me.

47
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,950
No one guided you?

48
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,510
Then you must be the mastermind.

49
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,120
No, no, no, absolutely not.

50
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,810
So this was all your doing.

51
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:13,670
No, no, not me.

52
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,670
- Then it's you.
- No... it's not me, milord.

53
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,360
No, no, it's not me.

54
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:21,460
It's not.

55
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,240
Where did this Mishenfu come from?

56
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,520
Where is Mistress now?

57
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,050
I dare not say.

58
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,220
Besides "I dare not say",

59
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,170
what else can you say?

60
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,310
Milord, Mistress sees through all things.

61
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,090
If I speak too much today,

62
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,520
I'll bring utter ruin upon myself.

63
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,540
Please, milord, spare my life.

64
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,250
Utter ruin...

65
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,590
Forgive me for speaking out of turn.

66
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,400
You're no match for Mistress.

67
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,000
Very well.

68
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,470
Give Lord Luo more challenge.

69
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,710
What kind of challenge?

70
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,520
So light as this, right?

71
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,000
Like ants moving house.

72
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,860
Keep adding on.

73
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:08,970
More, more, quickly.

74
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:09,810
Yes, sir.

75
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,680
Add a little extra.

76
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,390
Marquis, you're truly wise.

77
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,710
Your wisdom surpasses mine.

78
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,680
Not at all.

79
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,270
Still won't speak?

80
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,080
Lord Luo, you're a true man.

81
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,530
Then I'll trouble you.

82
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,390
Please move all these stones back.

83
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,680
You've got all the time to move them.

84
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,030
Hey.

85
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,620
Don't stop now.

86
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,070
I'll talk, I'll talk.

87
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,800
This…

88
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:52,850
Mishenfu was brought
from Jingkou Village.

89
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,960
And this Mistress you speak of…

90
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,040
Is she still there now?

91
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,090
I truly do not know, milord.

92
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,930
Then keep moving.

93
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,460
Spare my life.

94
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,230
Mistress is wise and mighty.

95
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,010
I truly do not know, milord.

96
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,120
I truly do not know, truly.

97
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,700
Mm, alright, alright.

98
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,510
I believe you.

99
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,490
That's enough.

100
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,240
Thank you, thank you.

101
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,400
Thank you, thank you.

102
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,480
Come here.

103
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,390
Come on, there's a reward for you.

104
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,160
That's what they call a real disgrace.

105
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,710
Milord.

106
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,840
Enjoy the scenery here.

107
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,510
- Milord, I was wrong.
- Milord, you're wise.

108
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:58,160
There are wolves up here at night.

109
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,030
Is that so?

110
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,580
- Milord.
- Corrupt official!

111
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:01,510
This is your fault.

112
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,020
- I shouldn't have listened to you.
- It's your fault.

113
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,280
Much obliged, milord.

114
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,600
Much obliged, milord.

115
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,120
Many thanks for your timely aid.

116
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,290
Thank you, milord.

117
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,930
- Thanks.
- Think nothing of it.

118
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,680
The Governor's men will escort you back.

119
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,840
Gather at the open ground.

120
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,390
They're waiting over there.

121
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,870
- Thank you, milord.
- Okay.

122
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,040
Much obliged, milord.

123
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,880
Let's move.

124
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,190
What took you so long?

125
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:33,040
Had you come any later,
you'd have missed me.

126
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,800
What happened to you?

127
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,380
Ugh, I'm sore all over.

128
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,850
I need a massage.

129
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,000
What is massage?

130
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,090
I mean, I need someone to press here.

131
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,220
Exactly, it hurts so bad.

132
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,560
Senior, Heng.

133
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,000
- Did he confess?
- No.

134
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,930
He didn't say a thing.

135
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:58,310
Only that Mishenfu came
from Jingkou Village.

136
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,440
Marquis, leave this one to me.

137
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,190
Keep that old rogue under close watch.

138
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,680
We're heading east to investigate.

139
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,310
Then you all must be careful.

140
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,310
Once I finish my duties, I'll meet up

141
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,870
with Marquis, Lord Wang, and Colonel.

142
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:14,800
Lord Sun,

143
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,160
you can simply call us "you all".

144
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,230
Makes things much easier.

145
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,600
Oh, you...

146
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,640
Alright, alright.

147
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,350
I'll take my leave.

148
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,070
My saviors,

149
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,240
my thanks to you three.

150
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,190
It was nothing at all.

151
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:36,740
Why are you still here?

152
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:39,330
Sir,

153
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:40,860
I am called Lan'er.

154
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,750
I was on my way to find my parents,

155
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,440
but was detained by Lord Luo.

156
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,990
Where are your parents now?

157
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:50,450
I heard they were taken
to Jingkou Village.

158
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:55,570
Um.

159
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,510
We are heading there too.

160
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,600
Going alone is not safe.

161
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,870
Let's travel together.

162
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,400
Thank you.

163
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,540
(Jingkou Village, Yuzhang Commandery)

164
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,390
Look over there.

165
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,120
Are you alright, sir?

166
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,090
Let me help you.

167
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,490
- Greetings, kin.
- We are family.

168
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,560
No need, no need.

169
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,560
Young man,

170
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,490
I must receive Mistress's blessing.

171
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,360
It's not heavy.

172
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,200
Easy there.

173
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,370
Horse Wang.

174
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,020
Brother, I've got a name now.

175
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,140
I've taken his surname.

176
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,200
My name's Scalp Wang.

177
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,810
That's a fine name.

178
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,070
Then I'll take Wang as well

179
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,190
and go by Horse Wang.

180
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,490
How about you two pick new names?

181
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,860
To serve you with all our might.

182
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:50,870
We're not changing.

183
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:51,720
No.

184
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,660
Don't make me look like some old relic.

185
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,400
Alright then.

186
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,480
From today on,

187
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,070
I'm your personal VVIP.

188
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:02,680
The match is tomorrow.

189
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,870
Do your best out there.

190
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,900
- Sure.
- Got it.

191
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,860
My VVVIP.

192
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,200
What are you doing here?

193
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,590
Long time no see.

194
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,510
The guy
from Changyi's equine administration.

195
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,360
Horse Wang.

196
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,620
And these fine folks are?

197
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,550
Oh.

198
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,430
I'm Qi Liuhai.

199
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,640
Also from Changyi.

200
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,060
I am De Jiu.

201
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,540
Good, good.

202
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,000
I can see you're all blessed folks.

203
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,750
This is what fate looks like.

204
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,270
Those who come here are family.

205
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:36,250
Very well.

206
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:37,800
Where's Scalp Wang?

207
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,510
Don't even mention that rascal.

208
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,330
After the Marquis left Changyi,

209
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,400
we too set out on our travels.

210
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,130
We meant to follow the Marquis,

211
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:48,540
but who would have thought

212
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:51,460
we parted ways halfway through.

213
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,280
So where is he now?

214
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,520
And who is this young lady?

215
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,910
I'm Lan'er, here seeking my parents.

216
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:02,170
What, your parents are in there too?

217
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,550
Oh dear, really now.

218
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,390
How could one forget their daughter

219
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,890
for Mistress's blessing?

220
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,870
Exactly.

221
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,190
Why is it this Mistress again?

222
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,320
Here's the thing.

223
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,600
We've long heard
of Mistress's great name.

224
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:19,240
So we came to seek her blessing.

225
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,870
Yes.

226
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:22,780
That's right.

227
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,320
Good. That's a fine thing.

228
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,390
Then let's receive Mistress's blessing.

229
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,520
Let's receive the blessing.

230
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,920
- Good.
- Blessing.

231
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,350
Come in, please.

232
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,530
This way, please.

233
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,910
This way, come.

234
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,440
Come, this way.

235
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,560
In Jingkou Village,

236
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,640
all family members
fall into three ranks.

237
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,310
Heaven, Earth, and Mortal.

238
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,470
The first thing upon entering:

239
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,800
An Emissary will assign your rank.

240
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,820
Busy working, my friends.

241
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,800
People of different ranks

242
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,330
have their own mission.

243
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,770
- I'm Mortal.
- Greetings, friends.

244
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,590
So I deliver the sacred herb
for Mistress.

245
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,750
You're back.

246
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,670
Earth Rank folks, like them,

247
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,840
grind the sacred herb for Mistress.

248
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,680
Oh.

249
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,560
For Heaven Rank folks,

250
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,310
they serve as Mistress's Emissaries.

251
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,680
Uncle Wang.

252
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,790
These here are...

253
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,670
They're sincere at heart

254
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,120
and have endured hardship.

255
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:19,980
As long as fate allows,

256
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:21,940
anyone can be part of our family.

257
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,600
Hardship doesn't scare us.

258
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,020
Here, everyone can earn gold.

259
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,840
Heaven Rank can receive
Mistress's blessing,

260
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:30,010
which will never run out.

261
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,480
Everyone can earn gold?

262
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,280
Who else but the marquis

263
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:34,630
would have that much gold?

264
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,150
Enough chatter, get the ranking set.

265
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,140
Yeah, you're right.

266
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,600
I'm counting on you.

267
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,390
Please notify the Emissary of Mistress.

268
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,660
It mustn't be delayed.

269
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,630
Alright.

270
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,230
Come on. This way, please.

271
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,170
- Come on.
- This way.

272
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:53,610
Family, please check in.

273
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,460
Much obliged, family.

274
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,320
You may all wait here.

275
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,390
The Emissary will arrive shortly.

276
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,370
Thanks to your kin for passing the word.

277
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,270
Once your rank is set,

278
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,730
you'll be family too.

279
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:06,910
Yes, of course.

280
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,480
One big family living in harmony.

281
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,320
Yeah.

282
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,760
Hey,

283
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,720
what's the standard for ranking?

284
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,200
After self-introductions,

285
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,560
the Emissary will decide.

286
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,260
Wait here for a moment.

287
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,360
I'll call everyone over.

288
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:26,030
They don't seem
under Mishenfu's influence.

289
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,670
It feels more like a joyful village.

290
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,040
Such calmness is what's strange.

291
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:36,030
Only a Heaven Rank can meet Mistress.

292
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:39,840
Savior, you want Mistress's blessing too?

293
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,840
Don't call me savior.

294
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:41,960
Just call me Wang.

295
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,390
Anyway,

296
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,600
once we find this Mistress,

297
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,360
you might find your parents too.

298
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:48,920
Come, over here.

299
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,790
If you want a Heaven Rank,

300
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,640
this self-introduction is important.

301
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,040
So make sure it stands out.

302
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,020
Later, follow exactly what I say

303
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,300
when introducing yourselves.

304
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:02,240
Family, gather up, gather up!

305
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:07,540
Seeing you all feels so warm.

306
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,640
Western Regions style.

307
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,990
This is the right place.

308
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,580
I once saw people in such garb
in Wucheng Village.

309
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:14,910
Let's welcome

310
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,910
(Emissary of Mistress)
four new members to our family.

311
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,890
Applause.

312
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,740
Wonderful.

313
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,400
After rankings are set,

314
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,440
they will officially become

315
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:27,780
part of our big family.

316
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,640
Come on.

317
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:31,910
Please, step up and introduce yourselves.

318
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,280
Alright, welcome.

319
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,440
Greetings, everyone.

320
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,400
I am Qi Liuhai.

321
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:52,400
I have led a hundred-strong team
in coordinated work.

322
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,120
I'm a natural leader.

323
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,070
I adapt swiftly to new situations,

324
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,520
especially to different work environments.

325
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,020
My resilience under pressure is...

326
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,580
strong.

327
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,840
I can regain composure
even in adversity

328
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:10,450
and swiftly return to peak performance.

329
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,880
In the days to come,

330
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:15,700
I shall give my utmost and live up to

331
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,030
all expectations.

332
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:20,910
Excellent!

333
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:23,630
Choose me, Qi Liuhai,

334
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,260
and tasks will be finished smoothly.

335
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,820
Excellent!

336
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:28,780
Alright, come on.

337
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,750
Next candidate, please.

338
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,130
Not bad at all.

339
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:36,550
Excellent, excellent.

340
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,700
Dear family members,

341
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,190
greetings to you all.

342
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,540
I am Wang Heng.

343
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,960
I've studied under renowned teachers,

344
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,200
mastering poetry, prose,

345
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,390
astronomy and geography.

346
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,750
I've made great achievements.

347
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,120
Amazing!

348
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,270
At the same time,

349
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,870
I have served several prestigious clans

350
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,600
and led teams of many members.

351
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,720
I excel in teamwork and leadership.

352
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,670
Impressive!

353
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:03,130
I believe that in the work ahead,

354
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:06,630
I can lead everyone efficiently

355
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,640
and achieve our mission with brilliance.

356
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,010
Family, dear family,

357
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:13,840
choose me, Wang Heng,

358
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,460
and it will be lively and full of charm.

359
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:20,420
Wonderful, wonderful.

360
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,260
Come on, let's welcome the next one.

361
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,290
Next up.

362
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:28,970
Oh, a young lady.

363
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,120
Greetings, everyone.

364
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,400
My name is Lan'er.

365
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,640
I was separated from my family.

366
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,600
Lan'er, Lan'er.

367
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,030
Lan'er.

368
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,320
Cry, come on.

369
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:42,790
Cry.

370
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:47,220
Anyway, I'm glad to join you.

371
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,660
Good.

372
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,610
Come on.

373
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,370
Let's invite the fourth one.

374
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,800
My name's De Jiu.

375
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,760
Nothing much to say.

376
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,410
I'll handle things as they come.

377
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,080
Good.

378
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,120
I'm the most obedient here.

379
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,510
I knew it would turn out like this.

380
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,110
- We have to count on ourselves
- Here are

381
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,910
- to uncover the truth.
- the results.

382
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:12,790
Let's welcome

383
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:13,870
the four candidates.

384
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,240
Alright.

385
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,160
Lan'er, De Jiu,

386
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,750
Earth Rank.

387
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,890
Good!

388
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:31,330
Even that gets Earth Rank.

389
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,130
Then we must be Heaven Rank.

390
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,510
Qi Liuhai, Wang Heng,

391
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:39,870
Mortal Rank.

392
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,400
Good!

393
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,850
What did you say?

394
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,420
Mortal Rank is fine.

395
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,960
Mortal Rank is fine, really.

396
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:46,960
Mortal Rank is fine.

397
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,320
We share the same room.

398
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,900
Oh, right.

399
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,180
We're all one family.

400
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,020
We're all family.

401
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,850
