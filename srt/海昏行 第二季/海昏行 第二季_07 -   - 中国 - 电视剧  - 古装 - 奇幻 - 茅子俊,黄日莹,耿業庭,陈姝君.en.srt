=Episode 7=

30
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,430
You're still alive.

31
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,790
I'm truly glad.

32
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:35,260
You've recovered.

33
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:36,760
I'm glad, too.

34
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,710
People

35
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:42,350
sometimes having a dream

36
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:43,780
isn't a bad thing.

37
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,200
All these years,

38
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,000
I've imagined you living far away.

39
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,760
It's just that you and I

40
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,070
would never meet again.

41
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,180
We were just one step
from taking Huo Guang.

42
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,480
Why did you back down?

43
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,800
Why would I ever back down?

44
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,150
It's just that I heard news at the time

45
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,240
that he'd sent troops to wipe you out.

46
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,120
I offered to abdicate
if he would call off the attack.

47
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,440
He agreed.

48
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,360
He sent the order to retreat.

49
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,330
But later, I heard that Wucheng Village

50
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,400
was awash in blood

51
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,500
and engulfed in fire.

52
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,640
By then, it was all too late.

53
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,080
When we arrived in Wucheng Village,

54
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,030
Zhang Sheng was already there.

55
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,610
As we stood our ground,

56
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,290
a group in Western Regions garb appeared.

57
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,510
Everyone suddenly turned on each other.

58
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,760
And I...

59
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,710
I somehow blacked out.

60
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,560
What about my brothers then?

61
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,000
I truly had no idea.

62
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,360
Only when I woke
did I learn His Majesty saved me.

63
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,630
He did a good deed that day.

64
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,570
Later, I heard you went to the Village

65
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,900
and even ran into danger.

66
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,560
Thank heavens, you ended up safe.

67
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,380
So...

68
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,770
It was you who summoned Lord Xu.

69
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,090
And His Majesty.

70
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,200
I spent years nursing my wounds

71
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,800
to repay him for saving my life.

72
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,110
I even served as an official
in Chang'an for years.

73
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,920
It was only right.

74
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,380
So the scar on your neck...

75
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,210
Was from that time in Wucheng Village.

76
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,100
This time I returned,

77
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,090
not just because someone meant you harm.

78
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,400
The Western Regions traders then...

79
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,270
I suspect they are tied to this.

80
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,870
I must uncover the truth,

81
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,430
set your mind at ease,

82
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,720
and give our brothers of Changyi

83
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,090
the justice.

84
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,120
I believe you.

85
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,810
Come, give him the antidote.

86
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,280
- Done.
- Next one.

87
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,640
- That way.
- Open your mouth.

88
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,300
Lock them all in prison.

89
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,470
- Come.
- Gather for detox.

90
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,270
In a safe refuge.

91
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,330
Treat them well with food and drink.

92
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:19,460
- Open your mouth.
- Move.

93
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,600
I want to work.

94
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,480
I want gold.

95
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,150
See that they're cared for attentively.

96
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,400
No mistakes are allowed.

97
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:29,470
Understood.

98
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,120
I want gold.

99
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,360
I want to work.

100
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:45,670
Rest assured.

101
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:49,430
I'll handle workers' matters well.

102
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,130
With you here,

103
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,680
I feel at ease.

104
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:55,320
Here's the list of poisoned workers.

105
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,050
Ten days of detox treatment.

106
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,290
Once their health improves,

107
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,430
give each of them a comfort payment.

108
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,000
That's very thorough of you.

109
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,130
I'm not done yet.

110
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:06,740
His... His...

111
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:07,700
His what?

112
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,170
- What?
- A letter from His Majesty.

113
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,510
Heng, you've gone far away.

114
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,020
I keep you close in my thoughts.

115
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:22,840
Whenever state affairs grow heavy,

116
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,730
I long for you by my side

117
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,900
to offer counsel and strategy.

118
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,350
May you return at the earliest time.

119
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,780
Go back to your Chang'an.

120
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,490
Someone misses you there.

121
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,410
Marquis, that's just...

122
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:44,570
Childish.

123
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,320
You…

124
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,100
(Haihun Marquis's Mansion)

125
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:12,980
What are you doing here?

126
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,190
You don't seem very polite.

127
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,590
Can't I just drop by?

128
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,110
Wherever you go, I'll go with you.

129
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,600
I'm going to sleep.

130
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,460
Hey, Heng.

131
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,840
Where are you going this late?

132
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,470
Haihun isn't like Chang'an.

133
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,060
It's not safe at night.

134
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,740
Childish.

135
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,590
Ah.

136
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:56,950
Why are you heading back?

137
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:07,410
Please.

138
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,350
Go, go, go.

139
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,740
(Are you there?)

140
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,700
(Yeah.)

141
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,580
(Come.)

142
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,860
(Yuzhang)

143
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,230
Heng, you look well this morning.

144
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,040
Having breakfast all to yourself?

145
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,760
Heng.

146
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,480
How's the pigeon soup? Tasty?

147
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,270
Not bad.

148
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,820
Let me tell you something.

149
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,000
This pigeon was quite nimble.

150
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,080
It soared and wheeled in the sky,

151
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,080
yet ended up as today's delicacy.

152
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,640
It's like certain pieces of news,

153
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,700
passed from one to another,

154
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,230
and in the end,

155
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,980
turning into a warm bowl of soup
like this,

156
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,040
right into my mouth.

157
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,240
Liu He.

158
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,310
Lord Wang, I finally found you.

159
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:54,950
Imperial Guard Commander

160
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,525
of the Huben Army, Wang Heng,

161
00:08:56,526 --> 00:08:57,790
receive the imperial decree.

162
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,710
Decree to the Imperial Guard Commander
Wang Heng.

163
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,370
We hear Xiqiang has ended their feud

164
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,630
and now seek alliance to invade.

165
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,880
This is a true threat at heart.

166
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,450
If they join hands with the Xiongnu,

167
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,240
it may endanger the State.

168
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,460
It troubles me greatly.

169
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:11,560
Wang Heng,

170
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:12,770
the post of Great General

171
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,960
remains open for you.

172
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,280
Only veterans
like Zhao Chongguo can serve.

173
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,240
Yet your skill is unmatched.

174
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,030
I often recall you at my side as my aide

175
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,530
and feel deep gratitude.

176
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,420
I long for your return.

177
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:29,240
Hasten back to court

178
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,910
and share the burdens with me.

179
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,640
Let us govern the realm together.

180
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,600
I shall obey Your Majesty's will.

181
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:36,840
Good soup.

182
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,790
This longing, this yearning…

183
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,040
Such a heartfelt imperial decree…

184
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,720
Even as a bystander, it gives me chills.

185
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,420
Lord Sun,

186
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:56,470
don't you find it a bit bittersweet?

187
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,520
Uh… we live rather close.

188
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,370
Sending messages by pigeon

189
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,400
is far too much trouble.

190
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,710
So I delivered

191
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:04,900
the imperial decree to you.

192
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,870
No talk of pigeons.

193
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,120
Come now, Lord Sun,

194
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,550
it's no trouble,

195
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,750
not in the slightest.

196
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,510
An hour is all it takes.

197
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,150
Oh dear,

198
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,360
this imperial decree holds
perfect authority.

199
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:19,810
You'd best head back.

200
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,160
Let General Zhao go instead.

201
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,030
General Zhao is already seventy.

202
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,320
Rest assured.

203
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,440
He can take them on.

204
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,800
I'll reply to His Majesty.

205
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,800
Alright, got it.

206
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,400
Oh, by the way.

207
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,700
Li Zhong has agreed to confess.

208
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,240
He'll meet you alone,
with his medicine chest.

209
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,480
Alright.

210
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,600
You may go now.

211
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,720
Yes.

212
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,230
Uncle Li.

213
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,160
I've brought you your medicine chest.

214
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:12,750
Have a seat.

215
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:27,790
This is

216
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,480
the antidote recipe for Mishenfu.

217
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,910
The guards at the ancient tomb before,

218
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,150
including their leader, took this,

219
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,580
so they didn't get poisoned.

220
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,390
You must keep it safe.

221
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,270
Thank you, Uncle Li.

222
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,360
I'll plead with the Marquis for you.

223
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,270
Lately…

224
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,790
My head's been acting up again.

225
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,060
Uncle Li.

226
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,340
Why are you doing this?

227
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,880
Who ordered you to do it?

228
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,640
Uncle Li, Uncle Li!

229
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,940
My aim is precise.

230
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,080
There's no saving me.

231
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:23,050
I can only atone
to the Marquis with my life.

232
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,920
If you ever see my son,

233
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,620
give him the medicine chest.

234
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,630
Go, quickly.

235
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,670
Hurry, go.

236
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,480
Haihun is no place for you.

237
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,560
You can't...

238
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,840
escape...

239
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,100
those from the Western Regions…

240
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,480
So that means,

241
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,440
Li Qi is still alive.

242
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,040
I don't know.

243
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,990
I've already fallen to such a state,

244
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,870
yet someone still wants me dead.

245
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,860
Those from the west

246
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,790
tried to harm you
in Wucheng Village 11 years ago.

247
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,410
My life's worth nothing now.

248
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,050
What could they want?

249
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,370
They're after the Qilin spell.

250
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,650
First, they got the Qilin
from the Huo Clan.

251
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,990
After the fall of the Huo Clan,

252
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,020
I investigated the matter in Chang'an.

253
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:22,560
In the end, I only seized
half the Qilin.

254
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,080
And you?

255
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,120
Aren't you also after the other half?

256
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,240
Will you give it a rest?

257
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,210
Can I survive this calamity?

258
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:42,050
Of course you can.

259
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:44,790
After that, how long will I have left?

260
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,030
Why would you ask that?

261
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,120
After going through all this,

262
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,270
my body's not what it used to be.

263
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,670
Just be straight with me.

264
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,610
You'll live a long, blessed life.

265
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:02,790
Really?

266
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,580
Really.

267
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,230
Look at those stars up there.

268
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,550
They're linked into a shape.

269
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,270
Doesn't it look like a lion?

270
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,920
That's your destiny star.

271
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,320
Lion?

272
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,120
Looks more like an ox to me.

273
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,940
It's more like a horse from here.

274
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,780
And it's got chains all over it.

275
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,360
Like it's bound.

276
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,580
What chains?

277
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,540
It's clearly surrounded by stars.

278
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,560
The starlight is dazzling.

279
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:33,910
It means you'll have a long

280
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:34,900
and prosperous life.

281
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,000
What kind of theory is that?

282
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,910
Astrology from the west.

283
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,120
Star sign studies.

284
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,690
Lord Wang, Marquis.

285
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,220
Lord Sun, have you found anything?

286
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,910
I came precisely to report on this.

287
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:55,550
These days, my colleagues and I

288
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,840
worked day and night,

289
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,200
neglecting sleep and meals,

290
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,320
burning the midnight oil.

291
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,620
Just tell me, did you or not?

292
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,550
We found nothing.

293
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:05,840
You've worked hard, Lord Sun.

294
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,360
It is merely my duty.

295
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,440
I cannot turn away.

296
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:11,630
Ah, Lord Sun.

297
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,480
Physician Li served me for years.

298
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,150
Though he made mistakes,

299
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,870
I must trouble you still

300
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,440
to see to his burial with care.

301
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,870
Rest assured, Marquis.

302
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,230
I'll take care of it.

303
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,450
Li Zhong's final words:

304
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,110
the enemy is strong

305
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:29,170
and hide in the dark.

306
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,930
We don't know what dangers await us.

307
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:34,410
The safest course

308
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,110
is to return to Chang'an with me.

309
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,910
His Majesty summoned you.

310
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,200
But I wish to go back with you.

311
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:45,970
Yuzhang is dangerous right now.

312
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,600
You're the Imperial Guard Commander,

313
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,090
yet you're so timid.

314
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:56,260
Here, take this.

315
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,380
I can't give you the official seal.

316
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,280
I simply think you're like that turtle,

317
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,220
always hiding your head.

318
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,940
You're the one who's like a turtle.

319
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,350
For the sake of your long life,

320
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,510
don't blame me.

321
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,360
What are you doing?

322
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,070
Bookworm.

323
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,360
How dare you seize me!

324
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,220
Yes, I'm seizing you. Now move.

325
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,450
Move.

326
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,320
Hyah!

327
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,400
Lord Wang, if you take the Marquis away,

328
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:33,000
