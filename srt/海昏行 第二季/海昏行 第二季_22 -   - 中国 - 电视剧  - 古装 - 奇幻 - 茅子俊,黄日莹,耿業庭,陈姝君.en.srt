=Episode 22=

30
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,510
Scalp Wang,

31
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,000
you and the brothers stay in the city

32
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,400
to protect the people

33
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,350
and the Marquis.

34
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,310
Wang.

35
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:30,390
Let me go with you

36
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:31,760
to avenge my brother.

37
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,000
I need you

38
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,200
to protect the people now.

39
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,680
Tell me. What's the plan?

40
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,070
I don't have a plan at all.

41
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,740
Let's just wait for the good news.

42
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,560
From what I know about you,

43
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,680
you'd never let Wang risk his life.

44
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,900
Seems

45
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,240
like I can't hide anything from you.

46
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,230
That's only because I know you well.

47
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,400
So, I'm worried.

48
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,000
I won't let you take risks, either.

49
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,320
This time,

50
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,000
you have to listen to me.

51
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,240
Stay put.

52
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,250
Stay alive.

53
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,310
Once I've decided,

54
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,620
who could ever change my mind?

55
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,360
After all these years,

56
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,430
don't you know me by now?

57
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,470
Marquis, here are the clothes
you requested.

58
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,400
They were worn for 27 days

59
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,580
and kept away for over a decade,

60
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,590
yet they're still as good as new.

61
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,960
Help me change clothes.

62
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:45,710
This way,

63
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,840
we'll have two chances.

64
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,450
All the antidote has been given out.

65
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,190
Make it like mine.

66
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,260
Let go of your hand.

67
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,870
What does this mean?

68
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,290
At this very moment,

69
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,710
what do you think?

70
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,520
We stand together?

71
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,560
When two people open their hearts,

72
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,680
they think alike

73
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,490
and act in perfect accord.

74
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,690
Let's go.

75
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,560
Yes.

76
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,400
I'll wear the dragon robe
and pose as His Majesty

77
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,980
to draw Li Nvxu's attention.

78
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,240
They'll surely chase after me.

79
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,960
Heng can use this chance
to save the people.

80
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,410
(Yuzhang)
Where will you lead them?

81
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,560
The mausoleum.

82
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,250
Once the gate is sealed,

83
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,440
they won't be able
to come out anytime soon.

84
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,720
I'll give you a ride.

85
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,760
No.

86
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,680
We've been together since childhood,

87
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,040
so let's stay together forever.

88
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,540
(Yuzhang)

89
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,840
His Majesty has invited Li Nvxu,
a heroine of Xiqiang,

90
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,180
to discuss matters in person.

91
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,390
Where is the decree?

92
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,030
Hyah!

93
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:48,790
Hyah! Hyah!

94
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,670
Alright.

95
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,440
Hyah!

96
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,840
His Majesty has invited Li Nvxu

97
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,100
to discuss the border troubles
in person.

98
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,070
Enough talk.

99
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,720
Let him come and issue the decree.

100
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,390
Or I'll kill them.

101
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,240
Hold on.

102
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,390
If your heart is set
on protecting your clan,

103
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,920
why not take this chance

104
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,800
to speak openly with His Majesty

105
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:19,230
and perhaps secure lasting peace
for your people?

106
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,390
Speak openly?

107
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,100
He hasn't even shown his face.

108
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,770
His Majesty is our sovereign.

109
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,420
How could he appear so casually?

110
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,910
Besides,

111
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,790
this place is full of your men.

112
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,050
What if an arrow flies from the dark?

113
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,440
We must still stay on guard.

114
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:41,920
Hyah!

115
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,300
(Yuzhang)

116
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,000
His Majesty braved mortal danger

117
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,070
and came out of the city

118
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,750
to meet you before both armies
to talk alone,

119
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,500
only to put your worries to rest.

120
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,360
You've seen it yourself.

121
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,460
We only have three people on our side.

122
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,760
But look how many stand behind you.

123
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,050
Doesn't that give you confidence?

124
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:22,650
Mistress.

125
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,200
They're all alone.

126
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,340
Even if it's a trap,
we can still seize them

127
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,970
and negotiate with Liu Xun.

128
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,350
You three, go with me.

129
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,310
How dare you lie to me!

130
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,950
None of you will leave alive.

131
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,230
Marquis.

132
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,800
Wang told me to keep you safe.

133
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,140
You mustn't go anywhere.

134
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,630
Do you want to go?

135
00:07:58,410 --> 00:07:59,370
Yes.

136
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,580
Then do as I say.

137
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,670
Sure.

138
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,750
Call every brother to join us.

139
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,590
Follow me.

140
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:05,430
Yes.

141
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:06,780
Go.

142
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:43,970
Hyah!

143
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,390
Hyah!

144
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:49,960
Protect His Majesty!

145
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,110
Could it be the Marquis?

146
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,630
Hurry!

147
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,720
After them!

148
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,970
The Emperor is trying to flee!

149
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,280
Hyah!

150
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,240
Traitor!

151
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,360
You often see things blurry.

152
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,550
You should massage this spot often.

153
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:37,760
This is the Yintang death acupoint.

154
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,580
It houses the gate of qi and blood.

155
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,270
If struck severely,

156
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,450
your energy will surge wildly,

157
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:43,770
and life will end instantly.

158
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,790
But with proper nourishment,

159
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,530
it will shine like a lantern high above,

160
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:48,960
illuminating the mind and spirit

161
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,530
and making eyes clear and heart serene.

162
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,280
So, the Yintang acupoint

163
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:54,640
is the gate between life and death

164
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,590
and the window to enlightenment.

165
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,080
When you are reading this book,

166
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:13,920
I fear I may have long departed
from you.

167
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,910
It has been over ten years
since you left.

168
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,490
The Marquis took me to Haihun

169
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,630
and treated me kindly.

170
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:25,290
Yet a woman from the Western Regions
forced me,

171
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,190
seeking the code of the Bronze Qilin.

172
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,040
Thinking of your safety,

173
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,810
I could only endure and comply.

174
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,320
Thus, I devised a plot
against the Marquis.

175
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,240
I had no choice.

176
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,280
My heart is filled with guilt

177
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:40,610
towards the Marquis

178
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,040
and Lord Wang.

179
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,320
The Marquis treated us so kindly.

180
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,720
If you can return one day,

181
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,840
serve the Marquis with all your heart.

182
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,770
He is a kind and upright man.

183
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,920
He will never let you down.

184
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,900
Remember to do good deeds.

185
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,440
The past friendship
between the Marquis and you

186
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,380
should also be kept close to your heart.

187
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,860
Your father, Li Zhong.

188
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,130
I've come to my senses.

189
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,510
I am the Marquis's sworn brother.

190
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:33,000
(Yuzhang)
Colonel.

191
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,840
Lord Wang.

192
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,630
I've brought every antidote
I could find.

193
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,270
Leave this to me.

194
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,870
Take care of it.

195
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,480
Hyah!

196
00:12:58,910 --> 00:12:59,910
Scalp Wang!

197
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,040
Don't worry about me.

198
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,090
I'll hold them off.

199
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:02,950
Hyah!

200
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,100
Hyah!

201
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:07,960
Scalp Wang.

202
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,440
Scalp Wang!

203
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:53,490
Hyah!

204
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:55,750
Wang.

205
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,910
I'll hold them off for you.

206
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,790
Hurry, the Marquis is in danger!

207
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,460
Hyah!

208
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:04,950
Whoa.

209
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,830
Whoa.

210
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,850
Wang.

211
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,760
Don't worry about me.

212
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,970
Go! Go now!

213
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,980
From this day on,

214
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,440
I'll be your personal VVIP.

215
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,290
- Then I'll be called Scalp Wang.
- What?

216
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,070
I grew up without a name.

217
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,080
It's my greatest honor
to take your surname.

218
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:23,060
You'll always be my VVIP.

219
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,860
Hyah!

220
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,390
Hold up here.

221
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,040
Help me dismount.

222
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,320
Come.

223
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,700
I told you
I wouldn't let you risk yourself.

224
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,840
Hyah!

225
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,760
Marquis!

226
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,870
Search every corner.

227
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,990
Mistress, watch out.
There may be an ambush.

228
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:02,800
- Go.
- Go.

229
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,610
Hurry!

230
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:14,470
Over there!

231
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:16,240
Chase!

232
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,580
Stop!

233
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,900
- Chase!
- Over there!

234
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,160
Chase!

235
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:34,670
Darn it.

236
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,740
