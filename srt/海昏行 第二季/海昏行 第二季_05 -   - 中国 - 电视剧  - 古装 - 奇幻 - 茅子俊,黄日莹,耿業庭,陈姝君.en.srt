Liu He.

31
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,310
Why are you eating the melon I bit?

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,840
Gross.

33
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,350
Marquis.

34
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,870
Slow down; don't trip.

35
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,400
Go away; that's gross.

36
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,240
- Hey.
- I...

37
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,590
You've finished?

38
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,880
Do you have to follow me?

39
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,380
I'll go wherever you go.

40
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,440
Even to the latrine.

41
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,430
(I dined with him.)

42
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,930
(The food was fine.)

43
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,800
(I was overthinking.)

44
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,800
(Seems Liu He has gone mad,)

45
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,860
(just as the records say.)

(A bout of intermittent madness)

47
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,720
(brought on by great highs and lows.)

48
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,290
(I can only spend more time with him.)

(Haihun Marquis's Mansion)

50
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,400

00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,120
Asleep.

52
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,800
You won't sleep without me, huh?

53
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,560
Liu He, Liu He.

54
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,480
Imperial Guard Commander,
what do you want?

55
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,510
What's wrong with you?

56
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,790
A bout of intermittent madness?

57
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:26,910
Wait a moment.

58
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,920
Stop beating around the bush.

59
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,280
Well...

60
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,810
My room

61
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,950
is a bit

62
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,150
cold.

63
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,190
This humble residence

64
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,750
is naturally small and chilly.

65
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,270
The Emperor's place is warmer.

66
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,400
Go stay with him.

67
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,310
Hey.

68
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:48,880
Ah.

69
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,240
I'm cold.

70
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,480
I'm freezing, truly freezing.

71
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,040
Listen to me.

72
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,240
I think

73
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,800
the South should have heating.

74
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,380
Heating.

75
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,700
Hey.

76
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,980
(Spirit Tablet of Li Qi)

77
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,260

(Spirit Tablet of Wang Heng)

79
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,510
Did I say you could come in?

80
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,270
It's been 11 years.

81
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:44,070
It's been 11 years since they died.

82
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,490
I thought you died, too.

83
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,170
I woke from dreams in countless nights,

84
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,680
seeing your faces drenched in blood.

85
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,110
Wang Heng.

86
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,750
It's been 11 years.

87
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,830
Not a single word from you to me.

88
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,860
(Spirit Tablet of Wang Heng)

89
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,950
Now, you stand before me.

90
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,510
Am I to feel overjoyed

91
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,780
or offer gratitude to you,
Imperial Guard Commander?

92
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,660
(Spirit Tablet of Wang Heng)

93
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,430
I'm going to sleep now.

94
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,960
Time to sleep.

95
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,310
Sleep.

96
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,750
I wrote you so many letters.

97
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,070
So many letters.

98
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,040
But His Majesty intercepted them.

99
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,590
Sleep.

100
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:53,440
Time to sleep.

101
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,510
Sleep.

102
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,620
This time, I've come back

103
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,880
only to keep you safe.

104
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:00,600
Just like before.

105
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,320
Lord Wang.

106
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,640
Marquis.

107
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,000
Time for your medicine.

108
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,590
Medicine.

109
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,000
Lord Wang.

110
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,960
I'll stay and look after him.

111
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,670
Duke.

112
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,800
Lord Gong arranged all these classics.

113
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,950
In Chang'an, you must study them often.

114
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:42,800
Alright.

115
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,640
Duke.

116
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,040
Lord Gong forbids taking wine
to Chang'an.

117
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,680
However,

118
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,330
I hid two jars in secret.

119
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,220
I'll fetch them now.

120
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,560
Ha ha ha!

121
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,480
Duke.

122
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,000
Bushi.

123
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,750
Bushi... Bushi.

124
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,880
Duke.

125
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,360
Zhang Sheng.

126
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,190
Why did you kill Bushi?

127
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,030
It wasn't me.

128
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,330
It was you.

129
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,420
If you don't believe me, look.

130
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,310
Duke.

131
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,400
It was Huo Guang.

132
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,320
I didn't kill anyone.

133
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,170
You love wine.

134
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,360
You killed Bushi.

135
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,440
Is this enough?

136
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,520
- Duke.
- Marquis.

137
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,160
Li Qi.

138
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,440
Marquis.

139
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,680
Don't be afraid.

140
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:44,200
You're dreaming.

141
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:45,690
Get back to bed and sleep.

142
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,080
Li Qi, tell Zhang Sheng.

143
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,320
I didn't kill anyone.

144
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,710
- I...
- Marquis.

145
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,750
This isn't your fault.

146
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:54,910
- It's all in the past.
- Li Qi.

147
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,200
- It's over.
- Li Qi.

148
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,740
Say something, Li Qi.

149
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,600
Liu He.

150
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,390
You don't believe me either, Li Qi?

151
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,860
(Yuzhang)

152
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,030
Ha ha ha.

153
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,960
No need for such formality so early.

154
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,120
Stay away from me.

155
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,440
Were you alright last night?

156
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:00,220
Don't tell me you remember nothing.

157
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:05,510
You laughed and then cried
at your reflection.

158
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,870
No matter how I called,
you stayed silent.

159
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,640
You don't know any of that?

160
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,680
I'm hideous.

161
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,580
Don't sleep here.

162
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,400
You might get startled.

163
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:21,410
Out.

164
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,140
Get out.

165
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,080
Fine.

166
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,000
Out!

167
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,840
Alright, alright.

168
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:38,860
Leave us.

169
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:43,420
The Marquis isn't sleepwalking.

170
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,250
He was not asleep.

171
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,730
He'd been speaking to an illusion.

172
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,780
It's a hallucination.

173
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,090
Hallucination?

174
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,460
That means visions in one's mind.

175
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,670
Most likely caused by poison.

176
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,190
But we eat and live with the Marquis.

177
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,000
Why aren't we poisoned?

178
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,740
We must have missed something.

179
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:10,910
Could it be Li Zhong?

180
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,840
(Haihun Marquis's Mansion)
Uncle Li.

181
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,120
Lord Wang.

182
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,200
What a coincidence.

183
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:21,800
Are you delivering medicine?

184
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:22,900
Yes, Lord Wang.

185
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:23,970
Let me deliver it for you.

186
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,790
- No need.
- It's fine.

187
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:26,630
It's nothing.

188
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,380
Lord Wang, that's not proper.

189
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,400
- This...
- Thanks.

190
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,460
Lord Wang.

191
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,870
Please spit it out.

192
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,780
Come on, spit it out.

193
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,920
The illusion...

194
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,480
When will it start?

195
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,800
So frightening.

196
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,330
You saw right; it's me.

197
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,280
Oh, my.

198
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,000
Why is the effect so slow?

199
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,360
Forget about the effect.

200
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,640
Look at this.

201
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,870
This is Li Zhong's prescription?

202
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,920
Yeah.

203
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,200
When Li Zhong was out,
I had his pharmacy searched

204
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,080
and found this.

205
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,270
I asked someone.

206
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:34,440
It's just some

207
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,270
mind-calming medicine.

208
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,790
You were sleeping so soundly.

209
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,550
That must be the medicine working.

210
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,660
Heavens.

211
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,830
What sort of sleeping medicine
works so well?

212
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,230
Sleeping medicine?

213
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,450
It's the mind-calming medicine.

214
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:49,390
Seems this has nothing to do
with Li Zhong's decoction.

215
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,010
We need another way.

216
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:56,080
But the Marquis often stays home

217
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:57,450
and rarely goes anywhere else.

218
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,660
Could it be the mausoleum?

219
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,390
He doesn't allow outsiders near.

220
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,720
I've only watched from afar.

221
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,910
That place is heavily guarded.

222
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,440
I have an idea.

223
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:12,500
The medicine's effect

224
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,020
is surging again.

225
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,540
Let's discuss the mausoleum tomorrow.

226
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,900
(Governor's Mansion)

227
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,740
Governor Sun.

228
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,890
Have you looked into the workers?

229
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,160
I have.

230
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,150
The workers seemed perfectly normal.

231
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,120
How could they be normal?

232
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,830
On my way to Yuzhang days ago,

233
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,480
I found them acting
like they'd lost their wits.

234
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,080
Their symptoms were
much like the Marquis's.

235
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,590
Could they have been poisoned together?

236
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,840
That's my suspicion as well.

237
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:39,120
At first, I thought it came
from the Marquis' decoction,

238
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,050
but my search proved otherwise.

239
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,600
So, I'll slip into the mausoleum
to see for myself.

240
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,760
No, you can't.

241
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:47,750
That won't do.

242
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,540
What else? You want to go instead?

243
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,520
Well...

244
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:54,140
Governor Sun, to be honest,

245
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:55,840
I came to Haihun this time

246
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,060
because of the Marquis.

247
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,680
Until the Marquis' matter is settled,

248
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:00,990
I can't rest easy.

249
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,960
Your devotion to the Marquis

250
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,440
truly moves me.

251
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,540
Alright, enough of that.

252
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:13,480
But how do you plan to get there?

253
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,620
That's why I came to you.

254
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,570
I need your help.

255
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,730
Disguise me as a worker
so I can sneak in.

256
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,400
This place is so desolate.

257
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,930
I feel uneasy in my heart.

258
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,460
This is the Marquis' mine.

259
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,550
Nothing would go wrong.

260
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:29,870
Hey, sir.

261
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,840
Where are you from?

262
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,600
From Youtang Village.

263
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,480
So, you're not local.

264
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,840
What brings you to Haihun?

265
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:38,030
I heard the Marquis pays in gold,

266
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:39,210
so I came here.

267
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,440
Come on, line up and get ready to work!

268
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:50,690
Hey, sir.

269
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,440
I have a question.

270
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,520
How much can we earn here?

271
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:55,720
Follow orders,

272
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:56,760
work hard,

273
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:58,660
and you can earn as much as you want.

274
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:00,050
Hurry inside.

275
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,700
Stay close; don't fall behind.

276
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:06,590
I want gold! I want gold!

277
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:07,840
Hurry, hurry, faster!

278
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:12,540
I want gold! I want gold!

279
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,730
Keep up, keep up!

280
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,320
I want gold.

281
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,600
Move, move!

282
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,310
Stay close.

283
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,410
I want gold.

284
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,480
Hurry up.

285
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:28,460
Keep up, keep up.

286
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,750
The gold is mine.

287
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:39,870
Faster, faster!

288
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,200
Quick, get over there!

289
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,960
Hurry, squat down.

290
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,840
What are you staring at? Behave.

291
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,560
Eat well.

292
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,080
Have a bit more.

293
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:11,660
There will be no food when you work.

294
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,590
Hey, I haven't eaten yet.

295
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,980
Then go hungry. Save your breath.

296
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,760
Isn't there still some in your basket?

297
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,240
Oh.

298
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,490
We've met
a hot-tempered tough one today.

299
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,640
Hey, hey.

300
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:23,790
He's being childish.

301
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,980
Good, you know your place.

302
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,330
Go on, eat.

303
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,620
We're here for money;
no need to stir trouble.

304
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:36,910
Thanks.

305
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,100
Why do they act like that?

306
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:41,150
They don't even see us as humans.

307
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,150
It's for the money.

308
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,260
With gold in hand,
a little shame is nothing.

309
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:46,260
Eat up, eat up.

310
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,840
You need a full stomach to work.

311
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,350
Alright, enough.

312
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,190
Up, time for work.

313
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,000
Up, quickly! Up, up!

314
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,870
You, come here.

315
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,400
Move.

316
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,480
Hurry, hurry!

317
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,600
