=Episode 8=

30
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:28,880
Whoa.

31
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,090
Oh,

32
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,480
I had no intent to follow you, milord.

33
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,120
I was merely concerned

34
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,840
for the safety of you two.

35
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,870
Lord Sun,

36
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:37,780
you have my word.

37
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,470
If blame comes from above,

38
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:40,660
I'll bear it alone.

39
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,530
Oh,

40
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,360
you truly take responsibility, milord.

41
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,640
I have one more request.

42
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,000
Could we untie the Marquis first?

43
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,480
Gently.

44
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,400
Qingge.

45
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,160
So you joined Heng in his mischief.

46
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,150
I don't think Wang was being reckless.

47
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,870
He must have his reasons for this.

48
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,510
Abducting an imperial...

49
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:07,790
Gently.

50
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,280
an imperial relative

51
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,210
could warrant death.

52
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:12,940
Lord Sun.

53
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,990
Are you still not acting?

54
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,270
Marquis, both sides are dear to me.

55
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,590
Oh my.

56
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:24,560
General Wang, you're rather forceful.

57
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,840
Hmph.

58
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,870
You seem eager to return to Chang'an.

59
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,250
I'd say it's you who's in a hurry.

60
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,480
Your thoughts, your longing, your hope.

61
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,980
Why are you acting so jealous?

62
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,870
This Haihun Marquis Domain feels unsafe.

63
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:40,800
Unsafe?

64
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:41,910
After this incident,

65
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:45,680
I realized you are the greatest risk
to Haihun.

66
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,200
Marquis,

67
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,630
outside your mansion,

68
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,330
you'll only find plain meals like this.

69
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,710
Hmm, smells wonderful.

70
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,800
Wang, come and eat.

71
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,020
This has quite a wild charm to it.

72
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,030
Wild charm, really?

73
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,760
Wasn't someone unwilling to come out?

74
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,650
Oh? And who might that be?

75
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,640
That would be me.

76
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,960
See, Lord Sun understands the situation.

77
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,280
Mother, I want to eat this.

78
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,200
I'm hungry.

79
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,120
Drink some water
and the hunger will pass.

80
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,960
Kid,

81
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,550
come here.

82
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:24,790
Sorry, milord.

83
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,920
Slow down, there's more. Qingge.

84
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,070
- Here.
- Thank you, milord.

85
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,130
- Take this.
- Thank you.

86
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,800
- Here.
- Thank you.

87
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,200
- Where are you from?
- Thanks.

88
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,120
Where are you heading?

89
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,520
We fled from Swan County

90
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,360
to Kangcheng.

91
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,240
Fled?

92
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,400
Why the need to flee?

93
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,760
The taxes were far too burdensome.

94
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,350
We even paid tax just to breathe.

95
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,850
We couldn't afford it anymore.

96
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,680
Sun Liao!

97
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,590
- Mar...
- Listen carefully.

98
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,550
Oh.

99
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,640
Madam, take your time.

100
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,180
I'd like to know more.

101
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,025
At first, they tricked us, saying work

102
00:04:00,026 --> 00:04:01,620
at the Marquis's place would pay.

103
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,540
Some said they went to dig for gold.

104
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,050
Others were sent to build tombs.

105
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,920
Either way, once gone,
no one ever came back.

106
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,500
They took all the men.

107
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,910
Now they're taking the women too.

108
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,500
The magistrate in the village taxes

109
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,710
under every possible excuse.

110
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,190
Even breathing costs tax.

111
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,450
We couldn't pay anymore.

112
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,240
So we fled in desperation.

113
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,450
Must be that foolish Marquis
behind it all.

114
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,000
I heard he's wealthy.

115
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,480
His mansion is filled with gold.

116
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:25,880
That's the price of our blood.

117
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,050
That wretched Marquis

118
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,990
must've colluded
with the Western Regions folk.

119
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,600
The men were tricked into going there.

120
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,440
Western Regions folk?

121
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,150
Who is it?

122
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,660
He said the Marquis owns a gold mine.

123
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,680
Follow him and you can mine for gold.

124
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,760
Child.

125
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,340
Here, buy some food.

126
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,740
Milord, you are truly kind.

127
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,680
Oh, don't say that.

128
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,740
- On your feet.
- Thanks.

129
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,110
- Up you get.
- Up.

130
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,420
- Up.
- Thank you, milord.

131
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,910
Get back on the road.

132
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:04,830
Go on, keep moving.

133
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:05,670
Much obliged, milord.

134
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,750
I know nothing of these matters.

135
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,590
Silence.

136
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,250
Yes, I'll be silent.

137
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,170
I'm not going to Chang'an.

138
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,430
I can't just walk away now.

139
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,420
I've told you before.

140
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,920
It's dangerous for you to stay.

141
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,190
And they're not in danger?

142
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,380
Then let Lord Sun handle it.

143
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,230
No.

144
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,930
Their suffering stems from me.

145
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,070
They scolded me rightly.

146
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,200
Every word rings true.

147
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,220
(Tea)
I shall bear every insult and jeer.

148
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,490
But I won't accept hollow survival.

149
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,680
I know you worry about my safety.

150
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,890
But since I still draw breath,

151
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,310
I cannot and will not

152
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,630
live on in ignorance.

153
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,080
I will head east

154
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,720
to investigate in Swan County.

155
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:55,710
Go back to Chang'an alone.

156
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,080
Indeed, Lord Wang.

157
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,090
I advise you to head back to Chang'an.

158
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,760
I shall remain in Yuzhang

159
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:05,680
to protect the Marquis

160
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,940
and serve the people.

161
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,360
That would be the perfect plan.

162
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,840
Didn't I tell you to keep quiet?

163
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,840
Yes, I'll keep quiet.

164
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,160
Heng.

165
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,950
Look at that young lady in red armor.

166
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,870
Doesn't she look familiar?

167
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,400
De Jiu.

168
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,440
De Jiu, what brings you to Yuzhang?

169
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,080
- Why...
- Wang Heng, take the decree.

170
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,750
Decree to Commander Wang Heng.

171
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,460
Xiqiang Tribe crossed the border

172
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:51,800
and intended to invade.

173
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,880
Envoys were sent to placate them,

174
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,200
but it only roused their anger,

175
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,500
leading to rebellion and plunder.

176
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,680
Now, scouts report,

177
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,830
Xiqiang elites have slipped into Yuzhang,

178
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,800
their intentions unclear,

179
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,190
yet they seem to stir unrest.

180
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,510
I command Colonel De Jiu

181
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,720
to ride swiftly to Yuzhang

182
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,240
and assist Commander Heng

183
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,360
to investigate discreetly.

184
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,160
I humbly accept it.

185
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,520
Marquis,

186
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,780
what is the meaning of this?

187
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,070
Eleven years ago,

188
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,630
because of me,

189
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,280
the heroes of Wucheng Village
were all slain.

190
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,400
With this kneel,

191
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,830
please accept it on behalf of

192
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,700
your Uncle Ren Xuan
and the fallen heroes.

193
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,680
It was all a cruel twist of fate.

194
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,490
Marquis, please rise.

195
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,070
Greetings, madam.

196
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,520
Senior.

197
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,220
We haven't met in 11 years.

198
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,400
Have you been well?

199
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,040
De Jiu,

200
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,250
it has been a long time.

201
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,710
Your manners feel distant now.

202
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:06,710
Well...

203
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,270
Long time no see.

204
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,880
You've lost weight.

205
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,200
Oh right, Qingge,

206
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,630
I need to tell you something.

207
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:17,950
Alright.

208
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,670
Hey,

209
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:29,910
what is it?

210
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:30,990
Even she has come.

211
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:31,840
This is for you.

212
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,770
Still thinking about my nephew's order?

213
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,150
I suspect Western Regions folks

214
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,680
are actually the Xiqiang vanguard.

215
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,510
Your poisoning

216
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:39,970
was their doing.

217
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,270
Then I must scout Swan County even more.

218
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,150
No.

219
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:43,990
No?

220
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:45,790
It's not up to us.

221
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,320
Go ask them.

222
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,030
It's been years since we last met.

223
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,480
We should really catch up properly.

224
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,340
Let's leave that matter

225
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,260
to tomorrow.

226
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,330
- Fifteen, twenty.
- Fifteen, five.

227
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,870
Fifteen, twenty.

228
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:06,710
Five.

229
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,270
Fifteen, twenty.

230
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,140
Ten.

231
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,190
Drink up.

232
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,440
Fifteen, fifteen, twenty.

233
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,280
Five.

234
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,900
Your turn to drink.

235
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,740
Twenty.

236
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,400
Good thing there's a spare room.

237
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,670
Why don't we have a drink?

238
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,560
Alright.

239
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,110
Here.

240
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,040
Here.

241
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,550
Don't worry too much.

242
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,580
His Majesty wishes to seek peace.

243
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,420
He is seeking an envoy
to parley with Xiqiang.

244
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,190
If the talks go smoothly,

245
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,550
the Great Han and Xiqiang
can avoid battle.

246
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,010
Then Lord Yan wouldn't have
to join the army.

247
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,920
I've thought it over.

248
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,680
My father is now advanced in years.

249
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,000
All these years,
I haven't been by his side,

250
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,270
fulfilling my duty as a child.

251
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,730
I plan to go to Chang'an tomorrow.

252
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,030
Lord Yan will be overjoyed to see you.

253
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,400
Thinking back on it,

254
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,040
I haven't been to Chang'an
for many years.

255
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,280
You've been there with Wang these years.

256
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,120
How is your life?

257
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:28,080
Not long after you returned to Changyi,

258
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,790
the Mansion was abandoned.

259
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,570
He and I kept ourselves hidden there.

260
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:34,630
He has remained in a coma.

261
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,380
Greetings, Your Majesty.

262
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,340
No need for

263
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,250
(Xu Pingjun, Empress)

264
00:10:46,251 --> 00:10:46,960
such formalities.

265
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,530
Heng still shows no sign of waking.

266
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:54,850
He's unconscious,

267
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,980
with no sign of recovery.

268
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:57,710
How are things

269
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,080
between you and His Majesty?

270
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,470
The same as before.

271
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,180
When will His Majesty remove Huo Guang

272
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,120
to secure his throne?

273
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:09,080
His Majesty knows of your feud
with Lord Huo,

274
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,600
but he says Lord Huo's loyal
to the court.

275
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,480
For the Great Han to prosper,

276
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,440
he is indispensable.

277
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,980
(Order)

278
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,780
(Order)

279
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,040
This is His Majesty's will.

280
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,080
The post of Colonel
of the Huben Army is yours.

281
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,480
Colonel of the Huben Army?

282
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,110
The heroes of Wucheng Village are gone.

283
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,910
His Majesty is deeply saddened.

284
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,030
This badge

285
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,520
is his way of entrusting
Uncle Ren and the Village.

286
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,890
From this day on,

287
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,800
you will stand for their loyal souls,

288
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,360
guarding by His Majesty's side.

289
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:39,800
But rest assured,

290
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,010
one day,

291
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,870
His Majesty will restore their honor.

292
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,740
- I...
- Not again.

293
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,280
I will not fail His Majesty's trust.

294
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,360
His Majesty wishes you to fight together.

295
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,110
I've sent men to seek famous physicians

296
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,220
and will inform you when there's news.

297
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,890
People of Baiyue use this
to treat hysteria.

298
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,290
The effect is fierce.

299
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:12,640
We can only give it a try.

300
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,840
Much obliged.

301
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,910
Fragrant sachets for sale.

302
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,480
Fragrant sachets, come take a look.

303
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,150
I came across this prescription.

304
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,210
I'd trouble you with this.

305
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,220
(Medical Prescription)

306
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,030
The remedies you bring
are stranger each time.

307
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,370
All medicine carries some harm.

308
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,600
Many are folk remedies,

309
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,000
never truly tested or proven.

310
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,060
They might harm the body instead.

311
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,620
Look at me,

312
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,030
am I not perfectly fine?

313
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,100
You test them on yourself each time.

314
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:49,940
It's okay.

315
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,930
You truly are loyal and devoted.

316
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:55,270
This person must mean a lot to you.

317
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,370
Could he be the one in your heart?

318
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:59,630
Please, much obliged.

319
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,050
I've searched everywhere

320
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,040
for the remedy.

321
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,720
I've tried every method there is,

322
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,670
yet he didn't wake up.

323
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,240
Until one day...

324
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,550
In the Western Regions,

325
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,240
a princess was framed

326
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,670
and her finger was pricked,

327
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,160
falling under a curse,

328
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,580
and slept for a hundred years.

329
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,780
She was saved at last

330
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,360
by a fierce remedy.

331
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,480
What remedy was that?

332
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,550
Breath Exchange.

333
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,000
Come here.

334
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,180
(Pharmacy)

335
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,530
(Been unconscious so long,
yet no better.)

336
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,790
(I guess I'll have to try that way.)

337
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,560
Forget it,

338
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,750
a desperate cure.

339
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,910
If you dare breathe a word of this,

340
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
you're done for.

341
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,960
And he's awake?

342
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,240
Awake just like that?

343
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,900
Waking up at this moment,

344
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,190
it's really a bit of a pity.

345
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:15,040
Yes, quite a pity indeed.

346
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,240
See? I told you.

347
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,720
Pity I didn't give that man any money

348
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:22,970
and even knocked him out.

349
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,850
That remedy was truly good.

350
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,620
So by that logic,

351
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:30,820
you and Wang have weathered

352
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:31,670
hardships together.

353
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,080
Yet he still doesn't know your feelings?

354
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,550
Perhaps it's better if he doesn't.

355
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:43,720
De Jiu.

356
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,270
That way, I won't expect anything.

357
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,390
Without expectation, bonds last longer.

358
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,700
What kind of reasoning is that?

359
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,960
Come on.

360
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,770
May Wang one day understand your heart.

361
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,280
Understand your heart?

362
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,010
What are you talking about?

363
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,450
My loyalty to His Majesty.

364
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,630
There you go again, always His Majesty.

365
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,500
Always trying to please those above.

366
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,010
Involution.

367
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,750
What does Wang mean by that?

368
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,280
Just the nonsense of a drunken man.

369
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,480
It means nothing at all.

370
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,180
Why is this still wine?

371
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,270
Where's the water?

372
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,310
Where's the water?

373
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:32,710
Ah!

374
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,480
Why did I sniff it again?

375
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,340
And I'm drunk all over again.

376
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:42,570
Um...

377
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,060
I'll go check on the Marquis.

378
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,350
Wang Heng.

379
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:52,720
Wang Heng.

380
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,320
Wang Heng.

381
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,290
Wake up! Hehee!

382
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,680
Come on, we're setting off.

383
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,290
Marquis, it's not even dawn yet.

384
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,190
Rise early to seize the day.

385
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,150
How was your sleep?

386
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,200
Do you understand?

387
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,430
The four of us...

388
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,080
No, five of us

389
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,080
should join forces for something great.

390
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,510
I never agreed to that.

391
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,240
I've already said,

392
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,150
you and Qingge return to Chang'an.

393
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,520
Wang,

394
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,760
let the Marquis investigate with you.

395
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,380
I'll head to Chang'an alone.

396
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,200
De Jiu told me,

397
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,120
Xiqiang has rebelled.

398
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,240
My father needs to join the campaign.

399
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,390
It will be perilous.

400
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,510
Heaven looks after the righteous.

401
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,920
Lord Yan will return safely.

402
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,110
So don't worry too much.

403
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,400
Much obliged, Wang.

404
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,440
But my father is quite old now.

405
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,850
If I don't return this time,

406
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,760
who knows when we'll meet again?

407
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:16,670
Qingge.

408
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,480
Wang.

409
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,160
You know how the Marquis is.

410
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,240
Once he decides, no one can sway him.

411
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,150
Don't worry.

412
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,880
Once this matter is settled,

413
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,550
I'll drag him back to Chang'an
if I must.

414
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,500
I'll keep the Marquis safe all the way.

415
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:34,630
Mm.

416
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,240
I'll trouble you with this.

417
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,080
Take care.

418
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,430
