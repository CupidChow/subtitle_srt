30
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,540
(Duke of Changyi's Mansion)

31
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:10,750
You...

32
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,280
You're awake.

33
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,030
Where am I?

34
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,330
How long have I been asleep?

35
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,840
Three years.

36
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,340
Three years?

37
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,830
Your wounds have healed.

38
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,190
(I can't be reborn again.)

39
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,980
(The aftereffects are worsening.)

40
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:45,970
(My slumber grows longer each time.)

41
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,310
(Next time, I might never wake again.)

42
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,640
Where is Liu He?

43
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,080
How is he?

44
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,350
Is he doing well?

45
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,460
Where is he now?

46
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,560
Lord Xu has taken him back to Changyi.

47
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,990
All is going smoothly now.

48
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,360
In the end,
he still returned to Changyi.

49
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,030
Nothing has changed.

50
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,230
His Majesty has arrived.

51
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,320
The Emperor...

52
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,470
Careful.

53
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:19,930
Greetings, Your Majesty.

54
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:23,740
Heng.

55
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,190
This is my new friend.

56
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,090
Kang Ning.

57
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,310
Heng, Qi.

58
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,320
See you again.

59
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,160
(Bingyi, Kang Ning...)

60
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,300
(Liu Xun, Emperor Xuan of Han)
(Kang Ning is Liu Xun.)

61
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,910
(So, Empress Xu Pingjun)

62
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,400
(has likely been killed by Huo Xian.)

63
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,280
Heng.

64
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,870
You're finally awake. Please rise.

65
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,450
Come on.

66
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:52,490
Thanks, Your Majesty.

67
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:53,930
Heng has just woken up.

68
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,280
Lady De Jiu, please prepare some food.

69
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,390
Yes.

70
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,250
I still prefer you call me Kang Ning.

71
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,750
Things have changed.

72
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,720
Please accept my condolences.

73
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,670
The past always lingers.

74
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,110
The Empress
and you shared deep feelings.

75
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,100
Now that the Empress has
passed away,

76
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,730
may you find solace.

77
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,040
Pingjun wished for you to wake up.

78
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,130
She said you possessed
the talent of statecraft,

79
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,430
fit for great duty.

80
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,560
What a pity

81
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,000
that she never lived to see this.

82
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:55,590
Heng.

83
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,040
You've slept for three years,

84
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,760
yet you know everything.

85
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,560
You truly seem to know
the Mandate of Heaven.

86
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,990
I ask for your aid, Heng.

87
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,750
Back in Wucheng Village,

88
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,680
you saved my life.

89
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,260
I will give my all in return.

90
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,240
I've figured out
that Huo Guang's kin killed Pingjun.

91
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,600
But now in the Imperial Court,

92
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,510
I stand alone with no ally.

93
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,660
My strength falls short.

94
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,610
What path should I take next?

95
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,790
Heng, I need you to guide me.

96
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,870
Does the Mandate of Heaven
hold a way out?

97
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,440
I will aid you.

98
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,220
But may I also ask a favor in return?

99
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,350
What is it?

100
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,960
Please treat Liu He with kindness.

101
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,360
Is it also the Mandate of Heaven?

102
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,590
No.

103
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,560
It is loyalty and honor.

104
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,030
Very well.

105
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,990
I trust you, and I promise you that.

106
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,000
For the coming years,

107
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,270
you need only remember one word:

108
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,340
Endure.

109
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,270
Besides that,

110
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,330
show great favor to the Huo Clan.

111
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,510
Three years from now,

112
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,290
Huo Guang will die of illness.

113
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,960
He shall have a grand burial.

114
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,760
Grant the Huo Clan endless honors,

115
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,870
and they will lower their guard,

116
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:29,930
growing ever more reckless.

117
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,120
Their ambition will rise,

118
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,270
and flaws and weaknesses will follow.

119
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,080
In this way,

120
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,270
you will have the cause to uproot them.

121
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,230
To me alone,

122
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,000
the Huo Clan and I are mortal enemies.

123
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,160
To the realm,

124
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,530
the Huo Clan's merit is beyond measure.

125
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,070
They are loyal subjects of the Han.

126
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,350
You know the answer.

127
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,370
You just want to be sure.

128
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,690
If things go as you say,

129
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,680
I'll let Great General Huo

130
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,970
live his remaining years in peace

131
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,250
and be remembered for generations.

132
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,520
Heng,

133
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,050
the command token under your pillow

134
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,600
was passed to you by Pingjun
on my behalf.

135
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,190
From that very moment,

136
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,610
you became my confidant.

137
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,040
I have endured for 21 years.

138
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,680
What is three more years to me?

139
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,160
However,

140
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,800
I must plan ahead for those three years.

141
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,730
Wang Heng, Imperial Guard Commander,
hear my command.

142
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,180
If the Huo Clan harbors
treacherous intent in the future,

143
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,400
you are to investigate in secret

144
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,330
and proceed with utmost caution

145
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,480
to confirm
whether their disloyalty is real

146
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,010
and be certain beyond doubt.

147
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,260
There must be no negligence.

148
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,710
Your Majesty,

149
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,040
with my health in such a state,

150
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,030
how can I still serve you?

151
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,670
Your Majesty.

152
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,710
Then I must trouble

153
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,970
the Colonel of the Huben Army

154
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:36,100
to help Heng regain his strength.

155
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:40,710
Yes, Your Majesty.

156
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,270
I will not fail your trust.

157
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,270
Colonel?

158
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,480
Your

159
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,750
right-hand.

160
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:54,750
Careful.

161
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,440
Careful.

162
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,640
Ready?

163
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,230
Let go.

164
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:10,370
One...

165
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,240
One step.

166
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,330
Step.

167
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,390
- Two steps.
- Two steps.

168
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,280
One

169
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:24,920
step.

170
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,440
Two

171
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,840
steps.

172
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,510
Three...

173
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,060
Rest every three steps.

174
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,390
Three.

175
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,840
Go slower up the stairs.

176
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:44,470
No rush.

177
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,710
What does this gesture mean?

178
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,600
That's called OK.

179
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,050
It means all right.

180
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,100
It means completed.

181
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,920
♪Night flows♪

182
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,530
♪Over the window frames and treetops♪

183
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,240
To Liu He.

184
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,870
How have you been?

185
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,600
- Now,
- Too slow.

186
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,450
- it's the Benshi Year 3.
- Faster.

187
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,930
I'm recovering.

188
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:29,090
De Jiu is looking after me.

189
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,480
Ouch.

190
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,440

A few days ago,

264
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,920
Huo Guang's son, Huo Yu,
staged a rebellion.

272
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,690

00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:33,800

00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:34,790
We joined forces.

275
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,630

276
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,300

277
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,980
but also every last remnant.

278
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,540
- You have your revenge.
- Stop!

279
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:41,470
Also,

280
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,870
I thought the fall of the Huo Clan

281
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,690
- could lead me to the Qilin.
- Stop them.

282
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:45,400
Don't move.

283
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,680
But there was a slight setback.

284
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,500
The Huo Clan committed treason.

285
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,770
They shall be crushed today.

286
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:52,140

288
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:56,340

292
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,470

293
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,890
execute them on the spot.

294
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,180
I'll talk.

295
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,660
A mysterious force entered the mansion,

296
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,440
led by a woman from the Western Regions.

297
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,500
I heard the patriarch
struck a deal with her.

298
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,590
She claimed she'd use witchcraft
to clear obstacles.

299
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,300
She left with a pair of Bronze Qilin.

300
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,520
What's her name?

301
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:31,220
This is all I know.

302
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,750
This time,

303
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,390
the move against the Huo Clan
was swift and clean.

304
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,910
I am greatly pleased.

305
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:43,590

325
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,590
Perhaps I should simply lie back.

326
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,520
What does that mean?

327
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,600
Lying back means

328
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,200
not striving for more

329
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,130

330
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,240
Well, that's one way to live.

331
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,910
You can afford to lie back,

332
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:46,550
but think of those around you.

333
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,370
