30
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,690
Yes, someone is robbing a tomb.

31
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,530
It's the place I just mentioned.

32
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,670
Officer, please come quickly.

33
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,390
Who are you talking to?

34
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:35,990
The police.

35
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,710
So this is the police?

36
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:41,690
No, it's a mobile phone.

37
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,360
It's the latest model.

38
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,500
My mom bought it for me.

39
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,610
If she hadn't sent it to me,

40
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,720
I'd still have no idea where she is.

41
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,390
Has it been long since you saw her?

42
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,610
Ever since she divorced my father,

43
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,300
I haven't seen her again.

44
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,450
Devour soul?

45
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,770
Such a sinister art truly exists.

46
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,020
When I was very young,

47
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,930
both my parents passed away.

48
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:20,450
So for me,

49
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,020
seeing them is impossible.

50
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,860
Didn't expect you to be so pitiful.

51
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,170
But I have a lot of buddies.

52
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,420
One of them is truly unusual.

53
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:36,820
How unusual?

54
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,540
Is he amazing?

55
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,260
He always comes up with

56
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:45,960
all sorts of strange, wild ideas.

57
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,930
He's helped me solve many problems.

58
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,220
And he's skilled at parkour.

59
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,830
What's parkour?

60
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,610
Sounds cool just from the name.

61
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,760
Jumping up and down all over the place,

62
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,120
like running across rooftops.

63
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,050
Oh, that I know well.

64
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,870
I do it every day in the school.

65
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,440
Isn't it just climbing walls?

66
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,100
That's one way to put it.

67
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,590
Then train hard.

68
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,170
You'll need it someday.

69
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,170
Mm.

70
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,620
Interesting.

71
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,140
My house

72
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,800
is several times taller
than the highest building here.

73
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:28,460
At night, the whole city
glows with lights.

74
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,650
So bright you can't see the stars.

75
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,790
The carriages need no horses.

76
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,440
They move on their own.

77
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,420
My wish

78
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,930
has finally come true.

79
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:44,890
This is for you.

80
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,260
What is it?

81
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,720
Bronze Qilin.

82
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,260
Half for you, half for me.

83
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,580
Consider it a token of our brotherhood.

84
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,500
Who said I'm your buddy?

85
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,200
We've been talking for a while.

86
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,750
There's at least a bit of bond.

87
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,170
I hold my buddies to high standards.

88
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:04,440
It's not a bit of.

89
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:05,700
It's the tiniest bit.

90
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,710
I'm only giving you this as a buddy.

91
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,020
Think of it as a charm for protection.

92
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,920
There's also a spell to keep you safe.

93
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,170
Really?

94
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,090
Mm.

95
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:19,610

Changes are cyclical,

100
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,980

101
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,940
Unveil the mysteries,

102

all at my command.

103
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,050
Got it memorized?

104
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,800
Mm.

105
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:35,810
Really?

106
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,370
Who are you looking down on?

107
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:39,010
I've got a great memory.

108
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,420
It's all because of you.

109
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:45,510
Chatting with you

110
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,570
made me miss my stop.

111
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,050
Sir,

112
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,300
I need to get off.

113
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,810
Remember our promise.

114
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,560
What promise?

115
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:09,630
The authority received a report,

116
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,540
(Nanchang, Jiangxi)
saying someone engaged

117
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,680
(Police)
in grave robbing.

118
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,470
The police acted swiftly,

119
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,050
working with the archaeology team.

120
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,100
They headed to the site for investigation.

121
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,860
After the initial survey,

122
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,520
it was confirmed to be
a grand Han Dynasty tomb.

123
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:23,980
Some experts suggested

124
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:27,130

the first Haihun Marquis.

Here, look at me.
