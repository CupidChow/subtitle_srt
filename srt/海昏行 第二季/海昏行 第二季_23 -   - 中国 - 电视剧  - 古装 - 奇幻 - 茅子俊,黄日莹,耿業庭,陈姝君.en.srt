00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,470

I'm not the Emperor,

38
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,150
but a deposed Emperor.

42
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,120

43
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,960

46

Yet you're still out here serving him.

47
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,440
Is it worth it?

48
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,980
Because I am a subject of the Great Han.

49
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,620

50
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,720
You failed to catch His Majesty.

51
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,640
I doubt you can return and report success.

52
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,590
Why not just

53
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,300
surrender here and now?

54
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,160

55
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,710

59

Do you seek a long life too?

60
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,960
What I want is the fall of the Great Han.

61
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,470
Not talking?

62
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,370

65
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,790

to harm the people,

67
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,590
stirred up trouble,

68
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,850
and plotted against His Majesty.

69
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,560
Today, I will see you
brought to justice.

70
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,560
And one more crime.

71
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,950
You held a vassal hostage.

72
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,540
Can you?

73
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,380

What is the Qilin code?

78
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:10,980
Speak.

79
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,090
- Speak, now!
- Fine, I'll tell you.

82
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,390

your meals as before.

191
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,250
Must you stay?

192
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,510
Yes.

♪Branded in my heart♪

00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:44,490
♪This longing is beyond price♪

195
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,820
♪One more glance♪

196
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,830
Last time, I meant to give you

197
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,080
this arc-shaped jade.

198
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,480
The star and your name share
the same characters.

199
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,960
But for the jade pendant,

200
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,760
it's written in a totally different way.

201
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,580
Written like this.

202
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,750
♪Flawlessness♪

203
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,640

216
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:48,900
(Western Han Dynasty,
Shenjue Year 3, 59 BC)

217
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,360
(Heng, how have you been?)

218
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,340
(My health hasn't been well these years.)

219
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,120
(My legs have grown unsteady.)

220
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,350
(Haihun Marquis's Mansion)
(But I'd still visit Chang'an)

221
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,360
(to pay respects to my grandfather.)

222
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,110
(We've all changed a lot
over the years.)

223
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,940
(Lord Gong isn't here with me.)

224
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,700
(At last, he can show his talent.)

225
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:18,980
(Bandits rose up in Bohai.)

226
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,840
(He went there as the Governor.)

227
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,070
Lay down your weapons.

228
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:24,500
- (They say the bandits feared him.)
- Good.

229
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,370
(I'm truly glad for him.)

230
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:28,000
Lay down your arms and we're good.

231
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:28,910
(To be honest...)

232
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,360
Don't cause trouble again,

233
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,080
(I miss the way he used to fuss at me.)

234
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,260
(Later, De Jiu traveled far to Xiqiang)

235
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,200
(to quell a rebellion.)

236
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,410
(She kept her word,)

237
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,850
(held on until the very last moment.)

238
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,150
(Qingge Tavern)
(Qingge's business is booming.)

239
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,350
- Welcome.
- Alright.

240
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,520
(She returned to Changyi.)

241
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,400
Slow down, sir.

242
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,390
(She reopened the long-abandoned tavern.)

243
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:02,480
(She told me)

244
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,770
- (you suggested some operation models,)
- Enjoy.

245
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,510
(like a chain model)

246
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,510
(and franchise model.)

247
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,440
(She aimed to create a top tavern brand.)

248
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,930
(But my health was fading fast.)

249
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,380
(If only I could hold on and return)

250
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,890
- (to Changyi...)
- Alright.

251
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,870
(share one more pot of her wine,)

252
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,430
(and see my homeland again,)

253
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,310
(then I would have no regrets.)

254
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:28,930
- (Also,)
- Your wine, sir.

255
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,550
(when Kang Ning arrived in Haihun,)

256
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:32,870
(I realized then)

257
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,350
(he was none other than Emperor Liu Xun.)

258
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,720
(He was indeed a fine Emperor.)

259
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,730
(Under his rule, the Great Han)

260
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:40,840
(grew more prosperous.)

261
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,960
(As for me,)

262
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,240
(apart from having much gold,)

263
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,180
(which you already know,)

264
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:49,890
(I wanted to make Horse-hoof
and Qilin-hoof Gold Ingots.)

265
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,480
(as a token of sincerity)

266
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,480
(to convey my wish to worship ancestors
in Chang'an.)

267
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,260
(Hall of Four Seas as One)

268
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,740
Your Majesty, Haihun Marquis offers
Tributary Gold and Wine again

269
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:13,240
with the intent to return
to worship the ancestors.

270
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:19,480
I accept his sincerity.

271
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,000
But he has a leg disease.

272
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,030
Long travel is unwise.

273
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,390
He should focus on recovery.

274
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,390
As for the gold and wine,

275
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,910
let him keep it

276
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,040
and nurse his health.

277
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,310
If we alone refuse his gold,

278
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,350
the other vassals may feel estranged

279
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,830
and think you're showing favor.

280
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,120
That would not be good for peace.

281
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,230
You...

282
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,080
Then put it another way.

283
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,200
Yes.

284
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:50,750
I can keep cordial ties with Qi Chang.

285
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,770
And the nephew can tolerate his uncle.

286
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,120
But this Imperial Court

287
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,760
will never abide a deposed Emperor.

288
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,340
Hush.

289
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,640
What is it?

290
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:15,650
I'll get off.

291
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,670
Marquis, I did not expect
to meet you here.

292
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,660
Lord Jin.

293
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,410
It has been over ten years.
How have you been?

294
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:49,420
I'm grateful you still remember.

295
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,330
All is well.

296
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,500
What brings you here this time?

297
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:11,640
Haihun Marquis Liu He,
receive the edict.

298
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:21,670
The edict reads: Haihun Marquis Liu He,

299
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,750
your virtue remains unrefined.

300
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,090
Only the worthy in merit

301
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,150
and virtue may pay respects

302
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:29,080
to the ancestors in the Ancestral Temple.

303
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,550
With Liu He deposed,

304
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,840
his title no longer exists.

305
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,930
He shall not offer rites to his ancestors.

306
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:36,450
Let him keep to his place.

307
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,080
So he may live out his days in peace.

308
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,000
Proclaim this to all.

309
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,550
So everyone may know.

310
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,160
I receive the decree.

311
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,380
Thank you, Lord Jin.

312
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,710
Take care, Marquis.

313
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,470
Move out.

314
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,880
(I'd meant to finish all
and then find you.)

315
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,060
(But I suddenly realized)

316
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,530
(the things I wish to do
never come to pass.)

317
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:54,040
(Seems immortality
holds no meaning for me.)

318
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,480
(If that is the case...)

319
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:01,770
Bronze Qilin,

320
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,390
guard the universe.

321
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,530
The firmament shines,

322
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,070
granting my wish.

323
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:09,460
Changes are cyclical,

324
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,260
eternal as sun and moon.

325
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,560
Unveil the mysteries,

326
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,760
all at my command.

327
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,140
(Wang Heng)

328
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,810
Guys, stay sharp.

329
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,660
Let me go! Let me go!

330
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:52,300
Let me go! Let me go!

331
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,150
Tomb robber!

332
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,450
- Boss.
- Release me!

333
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,140
- We found a child.
- Let me go!

334
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,030
Throw him into the pit.

335
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,260
- Bury him.
- Let me go!

336
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,790
Who disturbs my rest?

337
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,480
Wang Heng!

338
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,470
Wang Heng, where are you?

339
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,110
Immortal.

340
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,640
Are you here to take me with you?

341
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:25,960
Your name is Wang Heng.

342
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:26,850
That's right.

343
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,240
First, answer me a few questions.

344
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,240
Alright.

345
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,750
I'll tell you everything I know.

346
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:32,860
No.

347
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,040
You need to say,

348
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:36,720
"I'll speak of all I know,

349
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,400
leaving nothing unsaid."

350
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,830
I'll speak of all I know,

351
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,550
leaving nothing unsaid.

352
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,370
Where am I?

353
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,880
In Yongxiu County.

354
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:47,860
What year is it?

355
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,810
The year 2011.

356
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,990
That means it's over 2,000 years later.

357
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,350
Immortal.

358
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,880
I still have matters unfinished.

359
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,680
When I am done,

360
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,310
come and fetch me.

361
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:03,970
Wang Heng!

362
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,790
Where are you, Wang Heng?

363
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,040
Run!

364
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:08,510
Let's go somewhere else.

365
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,430
Running again?
