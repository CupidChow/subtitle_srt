30
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,510
Swan County is just up ahead.

31
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:35,750
Hyah.

32
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:36,910
Okay.

33
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,170
Tread carefully on this journey.

34
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,510
Do not reveal your identity.

35
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,800
Understood.

36
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,140
(Swan County)

37
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:55,420
(Swan County, Yuzhang Commandery)

38
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,430
Whoa.

39
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:00,380
Time for me to keep up with the times

40
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,290
and take on a new name.

41
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,520
New name? What name?

42
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,720
The Qi family name...

43
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,760
I'm still a Qi.

44
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,970
But I don't want to give up Liu either.

45
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,430
I also want to use the name Haihun.

46
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,560
What about Qi Liuhai (bangs)?

47
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,550
How's that?

48
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:21,960
That's a fine name.

49
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,180
Very fine, truly fitting.

50
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,940
Since the Marquis has a new name,

51
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,270
I should follow suit.

52
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,230
Lord Wang.

53
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,360
Help me think of one too.

54
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,710
Preferably,
with "Hai" in it like the Marquis.

55
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,590
How

56
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,040
about Di Zhonghai (bold guy)?

57
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,760
Di Zhonghai.

58
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,660
The sea is vast and boundless,

59
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:53,840
yet I'm the land
encircling the sea instead.

60
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,250
Lord Wang, what an excellent name.

61
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,190
That's a fine name.

62
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,680
Lord Sun, truly fitting.

63
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,000
It suits you.

64
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,400
Heng, you should pick one, too.

65
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,240
Silence.

66
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,680
I'm innocent.

67
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,000
You old woman.

68
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,220
Trying to harass Wu Sheng here.

69
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,690
Such behavior offends public morals.

70
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:12,560
How defiant!

71
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,920
I didn't.

72
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,520
Go, beat her hard!

73
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,750
Beat her hard!

74
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,800
Stop!

75
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,860
How can you treat
the commoners this way?

76
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,520
Do you deserve the uniform you wear?

77
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,790
Insolent rogue!

78
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,620
How dare you meddle in my affairs?

79
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,400
Of course.

80
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,880
- I'm warning you...
- Don't.

81
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,140
Let's find out what's going on

82
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,080
before we do anything.

83
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,360
Who are you?

84
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,830
I'm a traveler passing through.

85
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,030
Your behavior

86
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,360
isn't quite right, is it?

87
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,000
You travelers
should mind your own business.

88
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,150
Oh?

89
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,760
That's a rather unique outfit.

90
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,560
This robe

91
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,430
suits my taste perfectly.

92
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,890
Take it off and hand it over now,

93
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,510
and the matter ends here.

94
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:03,850
Not taking it off, huh?

95
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,230
Then I'll take it off myself.

96
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,990
You made the first move.

97
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,350
Take them down!

98
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,440
You dare defy the local officers?

99
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,410
Just wait and see.

100
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:39,160
Good, good.

101
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,240
Ma'am.

102
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,200
Come on.

103
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,270
Get up.

104
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:45,920
Ma'am.

105
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,360
Ma'am, what happened?

106
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,800
I couldn't afford the breathing tax.

107
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:54,520
I never teased the young men.

108
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,470
Ma'am.

109
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,000
Our country has never imposed

110
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,710
the breathing tax.

111
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,040
It only exists here.

112
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,560
If you can't pay it,

113
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,680
they'll make up some charge against you.

114
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,240
Then you'll face punishment.

115
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,080
What's going on?

116
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,920
Di Zhonghai.

117
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,830
Don't look at me.

118
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,600
I know nothing about this.

119
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,630
Ma'am.

120
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,910
If you can't pay,
what kind of punishment will it be?

121
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,880
If you can't pay,

122
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,000
they'll send you

123
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,720
to the Marquis's mausoleum

124
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,200
to work as laborers.

125
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,650
All the more reason we should help them.

126
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,800
Yeah.

127
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,110
You said it.

128
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,020
Don't draw attention.

129
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,680
Brazen woman!

130
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,820
Do you admit your guilt?

131
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,400
At dusk yesterday,
did you tease Wu Sheng in the fields?

132
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,870
Lord Hu, I'm innocent!

133
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,390
I swear on my life and honor

134
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,500
that I never teased Wu Sheng.

135
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,210
(Hu Kuan, Magistrate of Swan County)
Wu Sheng, speak.

136
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,270
Lord Hu, at dusk yesterday,

137
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:59,970
I was working in the fields,

138
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,800
and this woman suddenly came up

139
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,410
and persistently teased me,

140
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,180
speaking with shameless levity.

141
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,790
That was rather disgraceful.

142
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,600
She even grabbed at my clothes.

143
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,030
Thankfully, I ran off in time.

144
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:16,820
Or I'd have fallen into her clutches.

145
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,800
I was at home at dusk yesterday.

146
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,600
Why would I go to the fields?

147
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,000
Is there anyone who can testify?

148
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,140
- I was home alone.
- Oh.

149
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,190
Then it's impossible to prove.

150
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:28,860
Wu Sheng.

151
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,530
Do you have any proof?

152
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,560
Milord, please look at my back.

153
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,260
(A cute young man in the fields;
a fine match for me.)

154
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,810
I don't think the lady fancies the lad.

155
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,890
More likely,
she didn't pay the breathing tax.

156
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,820
Breathing tax?

157
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,600
That does make sense.

158
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,050
Such a domineering inscription.

159
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,050
The lady barely knows her letters.

160
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,800
With both witness and proof,

161
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,290
what else can you possibly say?

162
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:56,800
I...

163
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,350
Very well.

164
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:59,860
The case is now clear.

165
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:03,450
This old woman tried to seduce
the young man but failed,

166
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,100
which is truly disgraceful.

167
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,750
I'll give you two choices.

168
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,680
First, pay this year's
breathing tax in full

169
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,510
for this lad and yourself.

170
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,160
Second, perform corvée work

171
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,120
so as to warn others.

172
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,280
Corvée work...

173
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,560
At the Marquis's mausoleum?

174
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:17,520
Exactly.

175
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,500
It'll be hard to return.

176
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,390
That's too cruel.

177
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,720
I've heard the Marquis

178
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,910
takes five lives every night.

179
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,080
No one sent there for corvée work

180
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,870
has ever returned alive.

181
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:30,370
What's your plan?

182
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,790
That poor lady can't be
the only one wrongly accused.

183
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,240
I want to get them all out first.

184
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:36,890
- Let me go with you.
- No.

185
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:37,930
Absolutely not.

186
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:39,650
You're the best fighter.

187
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,070
I need you to protect us secretly,

188
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,170
in case something happens.

189
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,030
If danger comes,

190
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,260
act as you see fit.

191
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,200
Alright.

192
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,260
Guards!

193
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,000
Take this woman away.

194
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,520
- Yes.
- Milord!

195
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,230
I've been wronged, milord!

196
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:54,980
- This is outrageous!
- Milord!

197
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,310
With such a verdict...

198
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,150
I am truly wronged!

199
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,920
You're trampling on our laws

200
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,540
and crushing justice!

201
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,120
It wasn't even your turn yet,

202
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,110
and you've already jumped out.

203
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,530
Who are you?

204
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,580
I am

205
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,750
Qi Liuhai.

206
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,410
I am Di Zhonghai.

207
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,210
In broad daylight,

208
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,920
why should we pay tax for breathing?

209
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,830
Ha ha ha.

210
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,680
If I say you pay, you pay.

211
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,870
That's the law.

212
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,970
You corrupt official,
twisting right and wrong.

213
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,240
You're utterly brazen.

214
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,110
Insolent commoner, how dare you?

215
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,330
You're exactly who I'm hitting.

216
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:28,450
Don't move.

217
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,310
You've got nerve, Qi Liuhai.

218
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,270
You...

219
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,620
The Colonel of the Huben Army is here.

220
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,040
(Order)
Don't you dare move.

221
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,470
Oh.

222
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,280
Colonel.

223
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,590
Sorry for the lack of welcome.

224
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,150
Pardon me.

225
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,440
Seize them all.

226
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,160
Take them away.

227
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,620
Insolent commoners!

228
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,830
How dare you beat me?

229
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,000
Who gave you such courage?

230
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,660
To hit you, I need no one's courage.

231
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,480
- Do you know who I answer to?
- Who?

232
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:04,490
I don't care.

233
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:06,710
You...

234
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:10,860
Come on, Colonel.

235
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,090
Look.

236
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,200
They have no respect for you.

237
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,750
They are quite bold, indeed.

238
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,310
Oh, right.

239
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,890
Bold, very bold.

240
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,920
Hey.

241
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:26,080
Send this band of arrogant fools
to Lord Luo tomorrow.

242
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,450
Let's see how he deals with you.

243
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,510
Take them all away.

244
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,480
What does this gesture mean?

245
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,440
That's called OK.

246
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,870
It means all right.

247
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,010
It means completed.

248
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,340
Easy there.

249
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,870
Colonel.

250
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,440
Care to explain the breathing tax?

251
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,550
Colonel.

252
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,080
That was on orders from Lord Luo.

253
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,630
I'm just here carrying them out.

254
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,320
All I can do is follow orders.

255
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,560
Lord Luo?

256
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,590
Oh.

257
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,480
I'll introduce you
to Lord Luo another time.

258
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,510
We serve in the lower ranks.

259
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,580
You serve by His Majesty's side
in Chang'an.

260
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,710
When the time comes,

261
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,550
lend us a hand, will you?

262
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,470
Heh heh heh.

263
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,860
Put in a few good words for us.

264
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:26,840
Hurry up, keep up.

265
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,730
Li San, open the door.

266
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,080
Get inside.

267
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:37,790
Move.

268
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,560
Inside.

269
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:47,810
Don't be afraid.

270
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,720
I'm not here to harm you.

271
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,650
We only want to know the truth.

272
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,250
What on earth happened today?

273
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,120
I wronged that woman.

274
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:01,560
The Magistrate wrote
the ridiculous evidence on my back.

275
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,020
That's just your word.

276
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,970
It won't hold without proof.

277
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,020
We'll need a piece

278
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:11,280
of physical evidence.

279
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,480
Anyone with eyes can see it.

280
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,950
Why did you play along today?

281
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,500
I can't afford
this year's breathing tax.

282
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:26,930
The officers want to drag me
to build the Marquis's mausoleum.

283
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,140
They say that there is
no place for the living.

284
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,440
I'm not fit for heavy labor.

285
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,480
The Magistrate knew
that woman was strong,

286
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,890
so he ordered me to frame her.

287
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:42,000
Who set this breathing tax?

288
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:45,560
Lord Luo of Kangcheng.

289
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,900
Ah, I hate this so much.

290
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,190
Why are you wailing so late?

291
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,690
Heaven and Earth can be my witnesses.

292
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:57,560
Such wicked deeds happened,
and I knew nothing of it.

293
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,880
Knew nothing?

294
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,230
I think...

295
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,200
Don't scare him.

296
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:06,240
We believe you.

297
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,640
Right now, the truth matters most.

298
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,260
By the way,

299
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,680
how is Lady De Jiu now?

300
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,310
The highest art of concealment
is to hide in plain sight.

301
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,290
Since we're in the shadows now,

302
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,180
doesn't that make it double insurance?

303
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:26,070
I see. That's clever.

304
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,630
Up, up, come on!

305
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,530
Hurry, hurry!

306
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:33,370
Get up!

307
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,310
Everyone, on your feet!

308
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,790
Come on, everyone!

309
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,120
Up now, no delays!

310
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,120
Move it, stop dawdling!

311
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,040
It's not even 8 AM yet.

312
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,360
Why get up so soon?

313
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,280
8 AM?

314
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:49,800
His Majesty's routine?

315
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,270
Nothing, just Morning Qi.

316
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,210
Morning Qi?

317
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,990
Morning Qi is just Qigong
in the morning.

318
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,590
Oh.

319
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,240
Go, go, go!

320
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,240
How can you work dressed like that?

321
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:08,620
Hurry and change.

322
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,960
Move!

323
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,730
These unruly folks
need to be taught a lesson.

324
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,720
If we don't, they won't obey.

325
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,290
Such stubborn bones.

326
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,690
Ah, I'm exhausted.

327
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:21,730
Behave yourselves.

328
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,120
You'll suffer less that way.

329
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,240
Especially you troublemakers
in the lead.

330
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,350
Alright, alright.

331
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,930
Colonel.

332
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,990
Give me a hand, will you?

333
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,800
My back itches.

334
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,760
I can't reach it.

335
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:36,800
Itches?

336
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,910
Lashings will stop the itch.

337
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:38,900
I'll do it.

338
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,600
Heh, careful.

339
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,700
Walk faster.

340
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,440
I carry the Governor's badge
given by Lord Sun.

341
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,020
You can use it to mobilize the troops.

342
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,320
Just in case of emergencies.

343
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,550
Ah, right there, that tickles.

344
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:52,760
Oh, so ticklish.

345
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,760
Yes, right there.

346
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,720
There it is.

347
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:57,000
Yes, yes... Ah!

348
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,460
Why hit me?

349
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,850
- It hurts!
- Good, it should.

350
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,040
Then it won't tickle anymore.

351
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,560
Hurry, move out.

352
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,760
What's that saying again?

353
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,050
It's neither affection nor love.

354
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,080
Go.

355
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,430
You unruly folks, stay put inside.

356
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:16,950
Keep watch.

357
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:18,420
Get inside.

358
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,330
Colonel.

359
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,190
Please, this way.

360
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,600
- Move!
- Careful.

361
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,500
Hurry up.

362
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,650
Get in, move.

363
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,720
Behave yourself.

364
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,680
Keep up.

365
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,260
- Crouch down.
- Stay low.

366
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:34,780
Quickly.

367
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:35,690
Yes.

368
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,620
You, too.

369
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,040
Such cruelty.

370
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:40,790
Truly outrageous.

371
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,240
I'm talking to you.

372
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,380
Guess what's inside this chest.

373
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,280
Move faster.

374
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,230
Get in.

375
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,080
In.

376
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:57,880
Move.

377
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,750
Stay crouched.

378
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,550
These commoners have suffered enough.

379
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,320
Have some mercy.

380
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,240
Spare them the lash.

381
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,870
How dare you, a mere commoner,
meddle in my affairs?

382
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,160
Let me tell you all.

383
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:10,380
Your fate will be far worse than theirs.

384
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,590
They aren't even worthy
to be called commoners.

385
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,240
And you are no better.

386
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,550
In my eyes,

387
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,850
you're all just slaves.

388
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,250
Do you understand?

389
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,600
Aren't you just a petty yamen runner

390
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,340
bossed around by your superiors?

391
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,360
Why are you so arrogant?

392
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,200
Humph.

393
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,170
Saying this to me changes nothing.

394
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,420
I can still make you all serve me.

395
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,720
Don't even think of pleading for them.

396
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,870
You can't even save yourselves now.

397
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,560
Yet you meddle in their troubles.

398
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:41,700
Stay calm.

399
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,600
- Endure it.
- I can't take it.

400
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,440
Endure it for now.

401
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:45,930
Find the evidence.

402
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:47,900
How?

403
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:48,750
Shh.

404
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,000
Let me handle it.

405
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,580
Hey, what did you find?

406
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:14,930
All gold.

407
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,320
The gold

408
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,080
likely came from your mausoleum.

409
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,460
Building your mausoleum
was just a cover to mine gold.

410
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,600
The one behind this is quite greedy.

411
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,200
They want both wealth and people.

412
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:29,120
And even me.

413
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,800
Kangcheng has a strong force.

414
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,270
Take Lord Sun's command token

415
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,400
and call for reinforcements.

416
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,800
Up, up, quickly.

417
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:41,810
Colonel.

418
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,610
Move, hurry.

419
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,700
- Colonel.
- Go.

420
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,130
Let's head out.

421
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:48,940
- Lord Luo must be getting impatient.
- Go.

422
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,740
- I've escorted them here.
- Hurry.

423
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,280
- I'll take my leave.
- Go.

424
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,760
Stay for a meal with Lord Luo
before you go.

425
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:59,200
We still have many matters
needing your help.

426
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,690
Which one is more important,

427
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:03,960
dining with Lord Luo
or serving His Majesty?

428
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,610
I wouldn't dare.

429
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:08,650
I will return.

430
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,940
We'll discuss it then.

431
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,310
Milady, come back soon.

432
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:22,020
We still have much to talk about.

433
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,110
Commoners.

434
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:26,950
Get up, all of you.

435
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,350
Take them all away.

436
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,130
Lord Luo's getting impatient.

437
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,250

- Move.
