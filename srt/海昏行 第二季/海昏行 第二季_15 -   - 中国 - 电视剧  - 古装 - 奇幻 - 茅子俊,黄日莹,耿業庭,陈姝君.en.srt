=Episode 15=

30
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:26,720
How dare he do this!

31
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:32,530
Heng.

32
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,590
Heng, wake up.

33
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,830
My family,

34
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,070
Wang Heng destroyed the sacred herb.

35
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,200
He disrespected Mistress.

36
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,400
Mistress will not descend here.

37
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,880
His crime is unforgivable.

38
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,310
What shall we do with him?

39
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,120
Offer him as a sacrifice!

40
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:52,070
- No! No!
- Offer him as a sacrifice!

41
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,390
If you don't reveal the Qilin code,

42
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,960
I will follow the will of the people

43
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,570
and offer Wang Heng
as a sacrifice to the Mistress.

44
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,360
So all this grand display

45
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,260
is also for the Qilin code.

46
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:14,140
Now both Qilins are in my hands.

47
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,740
If you tell us the Qilin code,

48
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,660
I'll let you go without trouble.

49
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,140
But if you keep it from me

50
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,440
or give me a false one,

51
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,190
Wang Heng will be executed on the spot.

52
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:30,010
End him, end him!

53
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,000
As for you,

54
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,130
I have many ways

55
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,370
to make sure your answer is true.

56
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,050
Horse Wang!

57
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,540
You and Wang Heng
knew each other in Changyi.

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,990
By right, you should share his fate.

59
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:50,850
But if you turn back from this path

60
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,490
and sever their evil ties,

61
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,670
you'd ascend to Heaven Rank right away.

62
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,370
End him! End him! End him!

63
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,400
Horse Wang!

64
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,910
You ungrateful wretch.

65
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,540
Remember how Heng treated you?

66
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,280
End him! End him!

67
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,060
End him! End him!

68
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,870
End him! End him! End him!

69
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,710
I'll speak.

70
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,220
End him! End him!

71
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,630
You should've said so earlier.

72
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,680
- Defend!
- Senior.

73
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,680
Careful, Senior.

74
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,920
Hurry, protect the Emissary.

75
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,910
Clear the way for the Emissary.

76
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,180
I've already atoned a great deal for you.

77
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,260
Don't burden yourself with more sins.

78
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,090
Stop clinging to your delusions.

79
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,080
You're holding our savior hostage.

80
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,800
Without him, we wouldn't even be here.

81
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,050
Step back.

82
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,570
The stubborn one here is you.

83
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,340
Without the Mistress,

84
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,460
without the Emissary,

85
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,840
- I'll have no joy in my next life.
- Brother.

86
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,740
This life has been bitter enough for me.

87
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,990
You shall not stand in my way.

88
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,270
My family.

89
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,280
If you give your lives

90
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,630
for Mistress's and my sake,

91
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:19,240
that is the purest love in this world

92
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,830
and the finest moment for your joy.

93
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,800
Why not give it your all?

94
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,120
Strike!

95
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,250
Cut them down!

96
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,430
No!

97
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,350
Please, don't harm my family!

98
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:47,680
Let's go.

99
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,240
Fight them head-on!

100
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,160
Brother.

101
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,240
Stay back!

102
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,040
From this day on,

103
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,310
you are no longer my brother.

104
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,150
Brother.

105
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,380
You took my family from me.

106
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,830
You ruined my happiness
for the next life.

107
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,580
You are a wicked soul laden with sins.

108
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,630
- Brother.
- You are my enemy.

109
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,270
- Stay away.
- Brother.

110
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,110
Don't move.

111
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,760
I should...

112
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,360
I should be with my family.

113
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,320
Brother.

114
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:43,790
Brother!

115
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:49,630
Brother, wake up. Don't leave me.

116
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,800
Brother. Brother.

117
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,720
Brother!

118
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:04,780
(Jingkou Village)

119
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,600
De Jiu. De Jiu!

120
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,110
I'm here. It's alright.

121
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,110
Are you alright?

122
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,630
After that mist last night,

123
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,620
I couldn't find you.

124
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,770
I should teach you the Breath Technique

125
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:19,710
to resist toxic incense.

126
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,620
Everyone, come here!

127
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,680
Glad you're unharmed.

128
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,220
Yesterday, in the forest,

129
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,040
did you encounter anything strange?

130
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,090
It was nothing but fleeting illusions.

131
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,830
When I regained consciousness,

132
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,510
the mist cleared,

133
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,770
and I saw you bound upon the altar.

134
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,200
Lord Wang,

135
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,120
are you unharmed?

136
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,200
I'm fine.

137
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,360
Lord Sun, what took you so long?

138
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,190
Wang,

139
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:45,470
I ran into Lord Sun the moment I awoke.

140
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:51,940
Lord Wang,

141
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,000
what are you looking for?

142
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,760
Nothing.

143
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,040
What's wrong, Wang Heng?

144
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,560
The grove from last night is gone.

145
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:19,390
It was another illusion.

146
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,260
Oh,

147
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,350
what were you looking for?

148
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:25,440
The Qilin.

149
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,970
Must have been taken when I was drugged.

150
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:31,270
However,

151
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,480
I've smelled this scent

152
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,480
of bewitching incense.

153
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,760
What kind of scent?

154
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,970
Oh right.

155
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,330
I just realized they make

156
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:55,390
bewildering incense to sway mortals

157
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,830
and smuggle yellow-heart cypress.

158
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,970
Both Mishenfu

159
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:01,870
and yellow-heart cypress.

160
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,800
Forget it.

161
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,990
Let's leave here first.

162
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,290
Heaven will punish you for this.

163
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:10,750
Return the Mistress to us.

164
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,120
You will face Heaven's wrath.

165
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,960
You're a scourge.

166
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,810
This has gone too far.

167
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,870
Who do you think you are?

168
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,500
Return the Mistress to us.

169
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,340
Scourge.

170
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,310
- What should we do?
- No idea.

171
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,800
You… you ruined the Blessing Ceremony.

172
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,160
Heaven will judge you for this.

173
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,840
- Exactly.
- Return the Mistress.

174
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,700
Return the Mistress.

175
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,870
Return the Mistress.

176
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,200
Our home is already in ruins.

177
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,060
And here we stand…

178
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,550
Even our last bit of joy is gone.

179
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,720
You bring misfortune.

180
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,600
- It's you.
- You bring misfortune.

181
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:39,480
That's right.

182
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,240
I am indeed the ill omen you speak of.

183
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,710
Liu He.

184
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,000
I ruled for twenty-seven days

185
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,390
and was cast aside,

186
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:50,880
becoming the laughingstock of all.

187
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:52,760
To this day,

188
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,520
I have achieved nothing,

189
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,480
unable to keep you safe.

190
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,380
Now you hurl curses at me

191
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,070
and speak ill of me.

192
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,080
I will take it all.

193
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,470
Lord Sun.

194
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:09,570
Yes.

195
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,170
Please grant the people some money.

196
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,900
Yes.

197
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,900
To show my intent.

198
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,970
Give us money?

199
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:17,790
Really?

200
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,670
Everyone, collect your money.

201
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,240
Alright, let's go, everyone.

202
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,790
Go collect money, come on.

203
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,350
I know.

204
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,000
The Qilin is lost.

205
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,750
It's alright.

206
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,320
Only I know the Qilin's spell.

207
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,460
They'll bring the Qilin to find me.

208
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,870
I once gave you my word.

209
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,620
We work together as one

210
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,540
and reclaim the Qilin.

211
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:40,840
Then I'll take you home.

212
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:46,200
Truth is, going back doesn't matter.

213
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,090
What matters is once this is settled,

214
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,840
you must come with me to Chang'an.

215
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,680
You've said that more than once.

216
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,960
Is it because of the Mandate of Heaven?

217
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:00,120
It has shown

218
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,160
you'll have longevity in Chang'an.

219
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:08,670
What good is longevity?

220
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,550
When a mortal passes away,

221
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,670
the spirit won't fade.

222
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,960
Then they'll ascend
to the Immortal's abode.

223
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,960
Wouldn't that be great?

224
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,080
Ah,

225
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,320
the Immortal's abode.

226
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,790
Isn't that where you live?

227
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,550
Then we could visit each other.

228
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,800
Who wants to visit you?

229
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:25,870
Stay alive for my sake.

230
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,940
Alright, I'll stay alive for you.

231
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,500
You really mean to visit?

232
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,640
Visit me in Chang'an.

233
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,490
Besides,

234
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,230
get along well with your father-in-law.

235
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,440
Be a man who marries
into the bride's family.

236
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,790
That way, you'd have a place
to stay in Chang'an.

237
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,270
But can I still go back?

238
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,870
Leave that to me.

239
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,150
I'll speak with His Majesty.

240
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,150
Not the right time yet.

241
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,000
We can return to Chang'an anytime.

242
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,960
It'll make things hard.

243
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,870
It's not hard for me.

244
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:57,750
But it is for me.

245
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,480
After all, my surname is Liu.

246
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,930
Going back to Chang'an
fills me with guilt.

247
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,840
Our ancestors are all watching.

248
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,000
The chaos in Yuzhang all began with me.

249
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,370
I must take care of Yuzhang's people.

250
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,530
It's a debt I owe them.

251
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,690
I've owed far too much in this life.

252
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,630
I can't owe any more.

253
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,480
As your buddy,

254
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,120
I'll help you repay this debt first.

255
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,390
Once it's repaid,
we'll leave right away.

256
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,780
Isn't this the task
His Majesty assigned you?

257
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,390
Can't I bend the rules just a little?

258
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,230
Alright.

259
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,200
Then we'll head for Chang'an again.

260
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,790
Once more.

261
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,510
We'll make a difference.

262
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,510
Wang.

263
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,390
It's been eleven years since we met.

264
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,230
I hear your skills have improved.

265
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,960
And what of it?

266
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,250
I failed to protect who I wished to protect.

267
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,270
You've already done well.

268
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,390
Even the strongest

269
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,720
have moments beyond their reach.

270
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,150
You must live on in his place.

271
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,460
Carry his unspoken wishes and live well.

272
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,190
One day, when you meet again,

273
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,240
you can share every truth

274
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,260
of this life to him.

275
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,870
I believe when that day comes,

276
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
he'll understand it.

277
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,760
That will be the last and the finest

278
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,280
blessing you can give.

279
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,720
Will we meet again?

280
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,640
First, just keep living.

281
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:37,020
(Yuzhang)

282
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,670
Fresh tea and snacks here.

283
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,200
Come take a look, don't miss it.

284
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,320
Lord Sun,

285
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:54,140
find a fine place
for Lan'er and Scalp Wang to stay.

286
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,150
- Make sure they're well fed.
- Tea and snacks.

287
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,600
Rest assured, Marquis.

288
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,630
I'll see to it at once.

289
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,720
Go on then.

290
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:00,580
Alright.

291
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,720
- Senior.
- Come take a look.

292
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,670
- Stay at my mansion for now.
- Tea and snacks.

293
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,900
Wang Heng is there too.

294
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,750
No money? Then be on your way.

295
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,960
Get out of my business.

296
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:24,840
My apologies.

297
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,970
I'm simply starving.

298
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:26,990
Once I meet the Marquis,

299
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:27,870
I'll pay.

300
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,350
Li Qi?

301
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,790
Li Qi has returned.

302
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,970
Of course, I'm glad.

303
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:55,120
But what about his father, Li Zhong?

304
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,680
What else can we do?

305
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,860
We tell him the truth.

306
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,320
Perfect timing.

307
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:00,880
I have questions for him.

308
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,760
No, you mustn't.

309
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,000
He just came back,

310
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,060
still in high spirits.

311
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,630
Wouldn't that turn joy into grief?

312
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,640
Grown-ups must face reality.

313
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,960
You can't hide it forever.

314
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,920
No, that won't do.

315
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:16,010
Wait for the right moment to tell him.

316
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,770
Water, water, water!

317
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:31,960
My thanks, Marquis, Lord Wang.

318
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,430
My pleasure.

319
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,240
We survived against the odds.

320
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,650
Indeed, Wang.

321
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,960
Who would have thought

322
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,610
it was Zhang Sheng who betrayed us.

323
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:44,120
So how did you survive all these years?

324
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,410
I woke up in an old man's home,

325
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,030
my body riddled with wounds,

326
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,240
barely able to move.

327
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:52,060
Once I got better,

328
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,640
I lived by doing labor.

329
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:55,530
I never dared admit I was from Changyi,

330
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,400
fearing it would bring me to my end.

331
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,480
So I could only work in places
with no overseers.

332
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,710
That was no real work.

333
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,890
It was a life worse than beasts.

334
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,240
I couldn't bear it,

335
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,080
so I ran away.

336
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,100
Later, I heard the Marquis had come to

337
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,720
Yuzhang with my father.

338
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,480
I've been living on the road,

339
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,080
hoping to reunite with you all.

340
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,240
Who could have known

341
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,510
upon arriving,

342
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,910
I was taken away for labor

343
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,070
and managed to escape
after much struggle.

344
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:23,540
I narrowly avoided disaster.

345
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,000
Glad you made it back.

346
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:30,570
You can stay here

347
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:31,590
and recover your health.

348
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,200
Marquis,

349
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,030
where is my father?

350
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,110
Oh,

351
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,550
I've been away for long,

352
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,880
so I don't know how he is.

353
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,920
How about this,

354
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,360
I'll give you his location

355
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,240
and you can go see for yourself.

356
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:51,200
Alright.

357
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,040
When Father sees me,

358
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,360
he'll surely be surprised.

359
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:07,540
(Tomb of Li Zhong)

360
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:11,990
Uncle Li,

361
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:13,610
Li Qi has been found.

362
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:15,680
He's doing well.

363
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,920
But I still feel guilty.

364
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,230
I don't know when to speak up.

365
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:23,080
Nor how to begin.

366
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,860
(Tomb of Li Zhong)

367
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:40,870
Uncle Li.

368
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,510
Your cure healed the people of Yuzhang.

369
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,390
Your medicine chest is safe with me.

370
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,270
Once the truth is clear,

371
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,390
we'll find a chance to return it to Li Qi.

372
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,600
My most trusted aides are both back now.

373
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,870
Yet I can't help but feel,

374
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,150
Uncle Li ended his life for Li Qi.

375
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,200
And it seems he knew all along

376
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,480
that Li Qi was never dead.

377
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,480
Otherwise,

378
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,040
he wouldn't have entrusted me

379
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,790
with the medicine chest

380
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,330
and spoken of that one day to come.

381
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:21,550
Do you know where my son Li Qi is now?

382
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,850
If you see him,
give him the medicine chest.

383
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,560
It has been eleven years.

384
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,490
Not every brother from Changyi

385
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,830
have come to harm me, right?

386
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:36,190
I'd rather hope
it's just my overthinking.
