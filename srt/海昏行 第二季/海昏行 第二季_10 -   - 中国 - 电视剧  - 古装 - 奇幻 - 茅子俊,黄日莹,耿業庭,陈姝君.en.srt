=Episode 10=

30
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,420
(Kangcheng construction site,
Yuzhang Commandery)

31
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:32,190
Hurry up.

32
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,400
Move.

33
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:43,510
Keep up.

34
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:45,900
Lord Luo.

35
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,440
Keep up.

36
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,920
- Lord Luo.
- Hurry.

37
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,560
You came in person.

38
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,170
(Luo Xin, Inspector)
It is my greatest honor.

39
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:56,350
I am merely here
for a routine inspection.

40
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,070
Much obliged.

41
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:59,820
Milord.

42
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,040
This is what I wrote
to you about earlier.

43
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,280
These lowly folk dared
to lay hands on me.

44
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,040
One of them is called Qi Liuhai.

45
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,240
His manner was most insolent,

46
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,490
showing no respect for the law

47
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:12,840
and no regard for Haihun at all.

48
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,140
He's utterly unruly and reckless.

49
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,360
Which one of you attacked him?

50
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,260
Lord Sun,
I need you to verify something.

51
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,280
Hey.

52
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,260
Why does Lord Luo
look at Sun Liao like this?

53
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,300
Even if his identity is concealed,

54
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,240
the pull of bloodline still holds sway.

55
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,160
So, you are the famed Qi Liuhai.

56
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,880
I am Di Zhonghai.

57
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,150
I am the real Qi Liuhai.

58
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,780
I don't care who you are.

59
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,190
Take them to mend the road.

60
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,800
If you can't fix the road properly,

61
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,380
I'll make you regret it.

62
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,080
Alright, yes, yes.

63
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,570
- Take them away.
- Move!

64
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,870
Go on, what are you staring at?

65
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:02,950
Hurry up, move along.

66
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,200
Keep up.

67
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,950
That little official's got
quite an attitude.

68
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,530
- Stay calm.
- Get to work.

69
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,630
Lord Sun.

70
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,070
We follow
the Commandery-Vassal Parallel System.

71
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,920
Keep moving.

72
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,460
The Magistrate's backing is Lord Luo,

73
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,150
so his rank isn't far from that of you.

74
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,260
If he's met you,

75
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,550
- he'd know at once.
- Faster!

76
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,510
Then we can't hide it.

77
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,650
But clearly, he's never met you.

78
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,010
- Move.
- Yes, milord.

79
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,400
Since he doesn't know you,

80
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,470
we can quietly investigate.

81
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,680
Still have time to chat, huh?

82
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,280
- Get to work.
- Sure.

83
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,220
Big guy, head over there
and move those stones.

84
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,280
You two, go over there
and carry the mud.

85
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,360
Hurry up.

86
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,530
Li, Li!

87
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,300
You alright?

88
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,940
Quit dawdling and pick up those stones.

89
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:48,950
What are you staring at?

90
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,090
- Move!
- Pick them up!

91
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,020
Sir.

92
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,780
When did you come here?

93
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,530
How much money do you earn?

94
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,540
We're working so hard.

95
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,380
We should get paid.

96
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,230
Given the situation,

97
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,200
I fear there's more to it than it seems.

98
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,300
Exactly.

99
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,350
Hey.

100
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,120
What are you two dragging your feet for?

101
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,310
What are you two digging here?

102
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,160
Go dig over there.

103
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,000
Go.

104
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,030
Heng.

105
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,160
Ha ha ha.

106
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,600
A leopard never changes its spots.

107
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,040
That's going too far.

108
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,400
It's fine.

109
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,290
I don't make a living
by my looks anyway.

110
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,400
You go work over there.

111
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:07,950
You head over there.

112
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,230
Go.

113
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,120
Ha ha ha.

114
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,880
You really can't see, can you?

115
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,120
Truly so.

116
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,600
You brought this on yourself.

117
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,300
What are you staring at?

118
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,670
Get to work now.

119
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,010
Hurry and get to work.

120
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,470
Go work.

121
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,190
Old man, hurry up.

122
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,560
Don't slack off.

123
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,840
Put in more effort.

124
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,320
More strength, come on, move it!

125
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,490
Come on, put your back into it.

126
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,810
Faster!

127
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,310
Come on!

128
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,200
Oh.

129
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,490
Isn't that Di Zhonghai?

130
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,400
Hold it.

131
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:10,620
Don't block the way.

132
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,370
What do you want?

133
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,190
Those able should take on more.

134
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,240
Use this to carry it.

135
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,030
Guards!

136
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,170
Milord.

137
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,880
How have you been managing
the oversight?

138
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,300
Add more for me.

139
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,520
Yes.

140
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,980
So light and easy.

141
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,700
Like ants moving their house.

142
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,640
Give him more.

143
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,360
He's just an old, useless man.

144
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:58,530
He can't move this.

145
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:00,490
Hurry up.

146
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,840
- Faster!
- Be careful.

147
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,560
Thanks.

148
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,290
We help each other.

149
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,800
Once on this site, it's hard to get out.

150
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,680
True.

151
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,120
This road...

152
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,490
I just don't get it.

153
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,070
Why keep tearing it up
and fixing it again?

154
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,830
You don't know.

155
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,890
If they don't keep at it,

156
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,410
how would the lords earn their money?

157
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:23,990
Come on, back to work.

158
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,340
Sir.

159
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,950
Work must be paid.

160
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,680
You toil so hard every day.

161
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,430
Why don't you take your money?

162
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,970
Working for the Marquis,

163
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,940
who'd dare ask for money?

164
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,850
The Marquis is so terrifying

165
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,000
in your eyes?

166
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,150
More than terrifying.

167
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,720
He's just a jinx.

168
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,630
Truly detestable.

169
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,160
Enough talking.

170
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,070
We can't eat
or sleep well here every day,

171
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,280
and we don't get any money.

172
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,360
It's maddening. I'm going to sleep.

173
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,420
He feeds on people's lifeblood.

174
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,140
Not even a scrap of bone remains.

175
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,470
So many people

176
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,040
have lost their lives because of him.

177
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:17,760
Are you alright?

178
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,800
I'm fine.

179
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,040
Truly, I'm fine.

180
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,200
Marquis...

181
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,760
Over there.

182
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,860
I've found something new.

183
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,950
Come here.

184
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,680
I'm fine.

185
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,240
I'm fine.

186
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:07,360
This place is indeed strange.

187
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,200
How so?

188
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,870
It was a proper road.

189
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,180
Yet they dug half of it up to rebuild.

190
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,930
Now, only one carriage
can pass at a time.

191
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,800
Clearly, someone's profiting from this.

192
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,000
And quite a lot, too.

193
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,340
They keep doing it over and over.

194
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,350
Repairing again and again.

195
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,320
Each time asking for more funds.

196
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:26,970
Well.

197
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,110
It's my fault for not checking it.

198
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:31,300
My fault.

199
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,530
What do you mean?

200
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,560
Tell me in detail.

201
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:37,970
Well...

202
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:39,550
This really is...

203
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,320
Hurry up.

204
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:44,470
Hurry.

205
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,430
Move it, no slacking.

206
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,560
Quickly, quickly.

207
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,280
Work harder.

208
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,680
Use more strength.

209
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,810
All of you, get to work.

210
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,750
No food if the work's not done.

211
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,830
You fool.

212
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,140
Utterly foolish.

213
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,280
You can't even handle
something so simple.

214
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,320
Yes.

215
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,330
I am a fool.

216
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:33,670
So what if I'm foolish?

217
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,010
Go on, keep scolding.

218
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,200
Still daring to talk back?

219
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,390
- Go on.
- I'll beat you down.

220
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,320
I...

221
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,670
Milord, rest assured.

222
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:43,810
We'll get the job done.

223
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,630
Good.

224
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,120
Madman! Madman!

225
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,120
Get to work now!

226
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,100
What are you staring at?

227
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,110
Hurry up!

228
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:56,840
He's not wrong.

229
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,240
I can't do anything well.

230
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,320
But there's one thing you can do well.

231
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,340
And only you

232
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,790
can do this.

233
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,840
Quickly!

234
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,600
Work harder!

235
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,000
- Colonel.
- Faster!

236
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,020
Such a weary journey.

237
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,690
- You must be tired.
- No slacking!

238
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,230
I've prepared the finest feast,

239
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:27,200
awaiting you

240
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,700
to grace us with your presence.

241
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,510
This way, please.

242
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,630
This way, right this way.

243
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:35,860
Milady, take your time.

244
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,120
Milady, this way, please.

245
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,460
What are you staring at?

246
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:40,860
Two days later,

247
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,860
Mistress's important cargo
will pass through here.

248
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,080
Pick up the pace.

249
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,440
Get to work.

250
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,010
Colonel.

251
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,090
Colonel.

252
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,420
What do you mean?

253
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,840
A secret.

254
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,920
A secret?

255
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,720
Crouch down.

256
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,040
Let me sum it up.

257
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:02,610
Please, go on.

258
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,840
Lord Luo lied about the road repairs.

259
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,440
Do we have solid proof of this?

260
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,910
We have it all in hand.

261
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,440
He said Mistress
has important goods coming in.

262
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:15,530
Could that mean someone
of a higher rank is coming too?

263
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,010
Maybe that person

264
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,080
is the so-called Mistress.

265
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,410
Are our guards ready?

266
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:24,800
Lady De Jiu has arrived.

267
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,360
That means our people are in position.

268
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,920
Just waiting for the order.

269
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,960
Let's end everything.

270
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,320
What are you lot lazing around here for?

271
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,630
Get up and get to work!

272
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,460
Move!

273
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,420
You, too.

274
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,620
Work faster.

275
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:42,950
Keep watch.

276
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:46,990
Hurry!

277
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:52,890
Keep your eyes on them!

278
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,580
Stop.

279
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,670
Everyone else, leave.

280
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,600
This young lady stays.

281
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,590
Get moving.

282
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,200
Hurry, hurry, move!

283
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,270
This shipment looks pretty important.

284
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,610
I'll distract them in a bit.

285
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,830
You go check what's inside.

286
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,750
Be careful, Lord Wang.

287
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:16,910
Why don't you go instead?

288
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,630
I'm too heavy to run fast.

289
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,600
Alright, enough.

290
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,680
Come here.

291
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,590
Young lady.

292
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,530
Such slender hands you have.

293
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:29,400
They're not meant for heavy work.

294
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,940
If you're willing to follow me,

295
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:36,570
I'll see you well-fed and cared for.

296
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,020
Just tend to me properly.

297
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,080
Alright?

298
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,150
Lord Wang, we're outnumbered.

299
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,210
We must not act rashly.

300
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:46,330
I can't stand this.

301
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,270
I don't take anything by force.

302
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,760
As long as you agree...

303
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,540
How dare you?

304
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,630
Harassing a young lady
in broad daylight.

305
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,520
Lord Luo, such audacity you have.

306
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,170
Guards!

307
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,630
Mishenfu.

308
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,000
I'll kill you!

309
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,190
How dare you ruin my plans!

310
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,030
Take them down!

311
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,690
Drag this woman into my tent.

312
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:27,630
Milord, look behind you!

313
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,030
Insolent commoners.

314
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,500
How dare you touch
Mistress's sacred items!

315
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:33,530
Seize them!

316
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:39,900
Move!

317
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,810
You two again.

318
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,160
You're so domineering.

319
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,390
You ruined the people's peace.

320
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:50,720
Tell us who's behind you.

321
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:54,240
You have no right to question me.

322
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,970
Do I have the right?

323
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,180
I am

324
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,030
Liu He, Haihun Marquis.

325
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,170
You?

326
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,300
The Marquis?

327
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:07,960
Let me tell you this.

328
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,000
Even if Liu He came today,

329
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,400
he could do nothing

330
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,370
to me.

331
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:18,710
Fine.

332
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:22,030
Brothers, this official has no virtue,

333
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,640
borrows power from others' might,

334
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,700
and fills his own pockets.

335
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,660
He's torn countless families apart,

336
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:28,780
forcing all to suffer bitter toil.

337
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,630
He's truly lost all conscience.

338
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:33,440
Let's take down this greedy official

339
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,560
and return home.

340
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,880
Let's act together!

341
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,440
Ask them.

342
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,790
Will they listen to you?

343
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,310
Who among you dares?

344
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,060
What are you looking at? Keep working.

345
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,840
Come on.

346
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,000
Take me down.

347
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,080
Alright?

348
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,480
Where's De Jiu?

349
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,830
Come, milord.

350
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,100
Come on, take me down.

351
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,490
No one would dare to touch me.

352
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,410
No one.

353
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,080
- Listen to me.
- She's here.

354
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,560
Crushing you is easier

355
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,400
than crushing ants.

356
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:08,250
- Got it?
- Stop!

357
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,630
Colonel.

358
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:21,910
What does this mean?

359
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,670
Sorry

360
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,030
for being late.

361
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,790
Lord Luo.

362
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:29,780
Here she comes.

363
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,130
Colonel.

364
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,410
Who are they?

365
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,020
They are Liu He, Haihun Marquis,

366
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,860
Wang Heng, Imperial Guard Commander,

367
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,530
and Sun Liao, Governor of Yuzhang.

368
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,650
Who dares be insolent?

369
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,980
Spare me, milord!

370
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,450
Please, spare me!

371
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,630
Lord Luo.

372
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,540
I can do nothing to you,

373
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,120
huh?

374
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,100
I'm doomed.

375
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,990
I'm doomed this time.

♪Watch the storm;

377
