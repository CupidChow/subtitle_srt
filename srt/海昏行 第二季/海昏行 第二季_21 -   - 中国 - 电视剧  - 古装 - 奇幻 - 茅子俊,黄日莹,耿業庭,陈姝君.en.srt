=Episode 21=

30
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:29,380
(Yuzhang)

31
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,580
I've always been loyal.

32
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,140
The Governor's army is well-drilled.

33
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,380
They would never rebel.

34
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,150
There must be some misunderstanding.

35
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,720
It wasn't your soldiers who rebelled.

36
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,200
Look at their expressions.

37
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,830
They must be under Li Nvxu's Mishenfu.

38
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,660
(Yuzhang)
Li Qi.

39
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,900
You colluded with outside forces

40
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,870
and used innocent civilians as leverage.

41
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,310
Where is your conscience?

42
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,280
Enough talk.

43
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,470
You have no way out.

44
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:12,150
Hand over the Emperor at once.

45
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,610
Then these soldiers and civilians
can be spared.

46
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,920
Otherwise, blades will be drawn,

47
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,000
and blood will surely be spilled.

48
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,270
Li Nvxu.

49
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,820
His Majesty is burdened
with state affairs.

50
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,240
Why would he come to Haihun?

51
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,800
Don't play dumb.

52
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,910
The Emperor has come here in disguise.

53
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,430
Right now, he is inside the city.

54
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:34,800
I saw it with my own eyes

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,250
and heard it with my own ears.

56
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,630
Li Nvxu.

57
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,070
Leading troops to rebel
is punishable by death.

58
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,680
Turn back now while you still can.

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,870
I don't need

60
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,750
to follow your law.

61
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,830
How disgraceful
to use the people as leverage!

62
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,100
Where do you think you're going?

63
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,860
I have the Huben Army's elites with me.

64
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,230
I know the Breath Technique.

65
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,560
I can get close. I can kill her.

66
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,880
How will you make it back alive?

67
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,620
I...

68
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,680
I can't let you go.

69
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,580
I ride fast.

70
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,490
I can meet up with her.

71
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,360
No way.

72
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,750
I can't let you go, either.

73
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,590
Please allow me

74
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,190
to lead troops to eliminate Li Nvxu.

75
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,030
Absolutely not.

76
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,860
The people are being used
as human shields.

77
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:30,980
Once the fighting starts,

78
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,530
they'll be doomed for sure.

79
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,460
Lord Sun,

80
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,640
you want to lead the troops?

81
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,000
Our troops are all below.

82
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,430
Hold on.

83
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,960
Listen carefully.

84
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,750
Hand over Liu Xun at once.

85
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:56,980
Otherwise,

86
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,720
the ground will be littered
with the dead,

87
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,070
and the rivers will run red

88
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,360
outside of the city today.

89
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,570
Haihun

90
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,150
will become a city of death.

91
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,920
Indecision

92
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,390
leads to chaos.

93
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,000
Indecision

94
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,570
leads to chaos.

95
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,750
They seek to destroy
both body and spirit.

96
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,630
Indecision

97
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,070
leads to chaos.

98
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,440
Is His Majesty

99
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:19,830
still safe?

100
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,540
The Huben Army
is already with His Majesty.

101
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,120
Alright.

102
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,560
Li Nvxu.

103
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,360
The commoners are innocent.

104
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,940
What is it you seek?

105
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,390
We can talk this through.

106
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,560
Innocent?

107
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,870
When you harmed the people of Xiqiang,

108
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,120
did you ever think of our commoners?

109
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,310
We'd long lived in harmony.

110
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,410
Xiqiang...

111
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,610
It was that treacherous Emperor
who sowed discord,

112
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,040
pitting our own kin against each other.

113
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,680
Today,

114
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,510
I will capture Liu Xun.

115
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,630
Let the Great Han taste as well

116
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,650
the chaos of a realm in turmoil

117
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,750
and the agony of kin turning on kin.

118
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,350
Wait.

119
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,720
Li Nvxu.

120
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,890
His Majesty

121
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,840
is in the city.

122
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,830
What if I can persuade His Majesty

123
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,560
to call back his troops?

124
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,850
An idea to buy us some time.

125
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,360
We need to save the people.

126
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,370
Brilliant, Marquis.

127
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,920
Killing him will only vent your anger.

128
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,920
If His Majesty decrees eternal peace
for Xiqiang,

129
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,000
you'd be a true hero to your clan.

130
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,720
That would be a great deed.

131
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,200
You think the likes of you
can sway the Emperor?

132
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,050
I am his uncle.

133
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,280
This is his favored courtier.

134
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,390
At a time like this,

135
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,650
spare us the sarcastic tone.

136
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:53,580
To show our sincerity,

137
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,760
you may enter the city

138
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,560
and talk to His Majesty.

139
00:05:58,850 --> 00:05:59,690
Ridiculous.

140
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,120
You want me to walk into a trap?

141
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,560
Enough talking.

142
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,630
Hand over Liu Xun now.

143
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,940
Li Nvxu.

144
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,630
Think about it.

145
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,140
If, for the safety of your clan,

146
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,880
you enter alone

147
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,330
to negotiate,

148
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,340
you'll show your courage

149
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,710
and earn His Majesty's respect.

150
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:22,680
He might agree to withdraw the troops.

151
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,810
Li Nvxu.

152
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,190
His Majesty is benevolent.

153
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,290
As long as no harm comes to the people,

154
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,710
everything can be discussed.

155
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:32,870
Don't act rashly,

156
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,120
or you'll ruin everything.

157
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,520
Mistress.

158
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,510
The Huben Army is fierce and skilled.

159
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:43,950
If they charge out of the city,

160
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,730
we may not be able to hold our ground.

161
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:49,110
Why don't I head into the city first
to negotiate with them?

162
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,840
We can also test their true intentions.

163
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,350
Very well.

164
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,310
I'll send someone inside.

165
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,270
But I have one condition.

166
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,800
Once the talks succeed,

167
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,630
the Emperor must leave the city
to issue the order to retreat.

168
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,920
Have your Emperor prepare
the imperial decree

169
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,070
and bring it out personally.

170
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,890
Then please keep your word.

171
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,870
Harm no more innocents.

172
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:21,800
Open the city gate.

173
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,980
(Yuzhang)

174
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,560
So close.

175
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:53,750
So close to tricking Li Nvxu
into our hands.

176
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,040
Please calm your anger.

177
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,880
We have to keep a cool head now.

178
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,240
She's so cunning.

179
00:07:58,410 --> 00:07:59,700
She won't be fooled so easily.

180
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,560
What matters now is
how to negotiate with Li Qi.

181
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,160
You've thought of a way
to turn this around?

182
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,730
We can only take a gamble.

183
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,920
Wang.

184
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,800
I brought you Uncle Li's medicine chest.

185
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,840
Okay.

186
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,150
Don't worry.

187
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,000
I've searched him.

188
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,670
Where is the Emperor now?

189
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,520
Li Qi.

190
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,820
As a subject of the Great Han,

191
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,700
are you truly willing to serve
that woman from Xiqiang?

192
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:41,020
Where is the Emperor now?

193
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,630
His Majesty

194
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,870
is not in the city.

195
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,080
Fine.

196
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,100
I'll go report to Mistress at once.

197
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,790
From here on,

198
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,580
it's no longer my concern.

199
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,630
Li Qi.

200
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,530
Ever since leaving Changyi,

201
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,450
I've always treated you like a brother.

202
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,840
I don't want you to end up like Bushi

203
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,540
and ruin yourself.

204
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,390
Li Qi.

205
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,600
As long as you haven't left here,

206
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,100
there's still time to turn back.

207
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,480
When the chaos
broke out in Wucheng Village,

208
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,520
where were you, my brother?

209
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:21,120
When a blade was pressed
against my neck,

210
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:23,880
where were you, my brother?

211
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,360
You

212
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,350
have risen to a high rank and honor,

213
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,390
respected wherever you go.

214
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,920
You

215
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,320
still carry noble status

216
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:37,240
even after falling from the throne.

217
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,720
But I

218
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,200
could only grovel
and cling to life in shame.

219
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,630
Now, I finally understand Bushi.

220
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,470
You drove them to their deaths.

221
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:48,550
That's not true.

222
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:51,030
You've simply fallen
under Li Nvxu's spell.

223
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,780
You're just her pawn.

224
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,680
Better that than listening
to your wild tales.

225
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:55,820
Sometimes, lying comes

226
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:00,120
from being too close to speak the truth.

227
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,550
This was entrusted to me
by Uncle Li before he died.

228
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,900
He asked that I pass it to you one day.

229
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,320
That day,

230
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,770
he drove a silver needle
into his forehead

231
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,180
and died right before my eyes.

232
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:14,340
Every word I've spoken is the truth.

233
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:17,860
If you don't believe me,

234
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,100
you can kill me right now.

235
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:28,390
Then all grudges between us
will be settled.

236
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,710
I have only one request.

237
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,440
Tell Li Nvxu

238
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,310
that His Majesty is in the city.

239
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:35,510
Tell her you've made a deal,

240
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,980
and he will go and issue the decree.

241
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:37,820
Why?

242
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,120
This is our only chance to kill Li Nvxu.

243
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:47,090
Aren't you afraid
I might expose your plan?

244
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,620
Right now,

245
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,870
I've got no other choice.

246
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,550
Also,

247
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,360
I've always seen you as one of us.

248
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,550
All the credit always goes to you.

249
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,550
This is

250
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,600
our one and only shot.

251
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,910
Have your Emperor draft a decree

252
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,610
and deliver it personally.

253
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,320
We must act without delay.

254
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,160
Follow my lead.

255
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,230
Milord Sun,

256
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,000
as per the prescription
obtained earlier,

257
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,570
mobilize every pharmacy in the city

258
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,080
to brew the antidote now.

259
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:50,860
- Yes.
- Scalp Wang.

260
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,720
Take the men in the city with you.

261
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,390
Come with me to pose
as His Majesty's men.

262
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,830
We'll ride out to meet Li Nvxu.

263
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,790
Once she nears our carriage,

264
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,660
kill her in one blow.

265
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,200
Yes.

266
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,040
De Jiu.

267
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:03,630
Send a Huben rider out at once

268
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,960
to report to His Majesty

269
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,880
and ask him
to send reinforcements immediately.

270
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:09,760
You and the rest of the Huben Army
stay in the city

271
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,270
to protect the commoners,

272
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,150
as well as the Marquis and Qingge.

273
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,180
If I don't return,

274
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:17,820
seal the gates, stay inside,

275
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,790
and wait for rescue.

276
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,230
I can't obey that order.

277
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,450
I'm your superior.

278
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,630
You have to follow my order.

279
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,790
I'm your buddy,

280
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,920
so you have to listen to me.

281
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,840
Wang Heng.

282
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,130
I can't let you risk yourself.

283
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,210
Yes, Wang.

284
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,070
If you're in danger,
how can we just stand by?

285
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,070
Don't worry.

286
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,070
I can do parkour.

287
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,360
They'll never catch me.

288
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,440
That little skill you have
was taught by me.

289
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,440
Can you handle it?

290
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:38,320
I can ride a horse.

291
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:39,970
If needed, I can do it.

292
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,220
I've been an Emperor before.

293
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,670
Pretending to be the Emperor
is right up my alley.

294
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,510
No way.

295
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,000
The strike is too important.

296
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,510
Your skills aren't up to it.

297
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,550
I'd have to split my focus
to protect you.

298
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,850
Qingge.

299
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,530
This is nothing like the horse race.

300
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,990
Things are far more complicated now.

301
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,910
As your elder brother,

302
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:57,430
I can't let you take such a risk.

303
00:12:58,290 --> 00:12:59,700
I want this plan to be flawless,

304
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,520
with no room for any mistakes.

305
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,450
With me there,

306
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,790
there won't be the slightest slip.

307
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:04,670
Marquis, Qingge,

308
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,610
you should stay in the city
and wait for orders.

309
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,050
You and I will escort the carriage.

310
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,260
Inside, I'll place a Huben soldier.

311
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,990
With the Huben Army by its side,

312
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,980
Li Nvxu will think
His Majesty is within.

313
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,050
Once she draws near,

314
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,020
we will strike together

315
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:18,870
and capture her.

316
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:22,960
This is my OK.

317
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:25,810
Where's yours?

318
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,200
I may not understand every word,

319
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,730
but it does make sense.

320
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,800
You must be careful.

321
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,400
Oh, right.

322
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,190
This is the antidote to Mishenfu

323
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,040
I prepared earlier.

324
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,460
Make sure you take it on time.

325
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,750
Don't act rashly.

326
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,560
Heng.

327
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,020
You must come back safe.

328
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:04,430
Of course.

329
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,030
Don't forget about our gift

330
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:08,750
for two thousand years later.

331
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,780
That's our promise.

332
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:12,980
I've picked the place.

333
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,110
Remember:

334
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,310
In Haihun,

335
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,360
go against the wind

336
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,420
for 50 li.

337
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,530
At the south of the waters,

338
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:19,860
chisel the turtle head place,

339
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:20,990
and the treasure will emerge.

340
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,390
Alright, I'll remember.

341
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,080
At a time like this,

342
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,720
you're still playing guessing games?

343
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,630
This isn't a game.

344
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,800
It's a hope to hold on to.

345
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,320
With hope,

346
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,820
there's a goal to strive for.

347
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,030
I have a hope.

348
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,240
When will you

349
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,320
grant me a post in Haihun?

350
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,760
You won't return to Chang'an?

351
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,150
No.

352
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,570
Even if the Emperor

353
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,510
names you the Great General,

354
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:02,580
you won't go back?

355
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:03,590
I won't.

356
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,100
I'll stay here in Haihun.

357
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,840
When I return,

358
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,060
have this post carved for me.

359
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,920
That's the task I'm giving you.

360
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,440
Why haven't you finished?

361
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,470
Go now.

362
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,500
