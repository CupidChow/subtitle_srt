=Episode 13=

30
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,370
Is it true that

31
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,340
every male of Heaven Rank

32
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,120
is paired with a lady of Earth Rank?

33
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,520
I've said before.

34
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,720
It is the duty of Earth Rank women.

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,080
- Rogue!
- Sorry.

36
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,230
Come on.

37
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,710
Can't you see I'm bestowing blessings?

38
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:06,810
Wang Heng.

39
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,400
It's so late.

40
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,760
What are you doing with that basin?

41
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,190
I went to wash up.

42
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,030
You went alone?

43
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,120
Of course.

44
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,960
Let me tell you this.

45
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,960
A young lady must be careful
when away from home.

46
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,520
There are many with ill intentions.

47
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,500
I'll walk you back to your room.

48
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,640
Shouldn't you be warning
the ill-doers instead?

49
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,830
They should watch out for me.

50
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,290
Not all villains rely on force.

51
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,130
This place is dangerous.

52
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,700
If you breathe in poison
grinding the sacred herb,

53
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,000
you might end up doing
something you'd regret.

54
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,520
What exactly would I do?

55
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,160
In Chang'an, I let you be.

56
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,630
But now, we're working here.

57
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,470
I'm your superior.

58
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,990
You must follow my lead.

59
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,310
Let's go.

60
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,360
Lan'er.

61
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,080
Wang said he doesn't like me,

62
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,850
so he never saw me as family.

63
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,100
That's why he kept his distance.

64
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,030
He should. It's so late.

65
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,550
I never let her get close.

66
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,940
So, this is the regret you spoke of.

67
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,730
I was only trying
to save you from regret.

68
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:08,260
(Jingkou Village)

69
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,320
Wang Heng.

70
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,540
I heard you united
Heaven and Earth last night.

71
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:15,960
Such joyous news!

72
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:18,710
What do you mean?

73
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,620
You're Heaven, and she's Earth.

74
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,920
Last night, she willingly served you.

75
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,030
That's uniting Heaven and Earth.

76
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,630
It brings endless vitality.

77
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,740
What nonsense.

78
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,440
No need to act shy.

79
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,040
It's a blessing for a new family member.

80
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,910
She might even share
in your good fortune

81
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,870
and attend the Blessing Ceremony.

82
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,880
This Earth Rank family member.

83
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,690
I've been watching you for days.

84
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,520
You're as cold as winter frost.

85
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,510
Rarely speaking a word.

86
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,500
If you go on like this,

87
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,380
how will you fit into the family?

88
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,680
Or receive Mistress's blessing?

89
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:50,870
How about this?

90
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,240
Why not accept my blessing?

91
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,870
Didn't you bestow one last night?

92
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,760
Hey.

93
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:01,190
Have you heard that greater power
means greater duty?

94
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,200
Come on, let's go.

95
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,480
Wang.

96
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,650
Lan'er, stop trailing me.

97
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,360
Please, after you.

98
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,280
What's the matter?

99
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,870
Starting today,

100
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,760
your task is to record
the numbers they choose.

101
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,640
Oh, right.

102
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,150
What does the blessing mean?

103
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,920
If you're bestowed,

104
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,100
you'll regret it.

105
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,180
Disgusting.

106
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,230
Yes, truly disgusting.

107
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,220
But don't worry.

108
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:44,920
I'll keep you safe.

109
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,090
No one will dare touch you.

110
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,640
Who'd dare get close to me?

111
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,190
Exactly, no one dares get near you.

112
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:54,120
But if you strike at those villains,

113
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,600
won't our entire cover be blown?

114
00:05:59,020 --> 00:05:59,860
Don't worry.

115
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,050
I know my limits.

116
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,610
Limits should be set by the leader,

117
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,340
which, in this case, is me.

118
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,480
You

119
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,580
just stay within three steps of me.

120
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,320
Wang.

121
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,230
Congratulations to you.

122
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,260
So early.

123
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,120
Of course.

124
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,450
I must work hard

125
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,110
to reach Heaven Rank asap

126
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,000
so as to meet Mistress

127
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,380
and receive her blessing.

128
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,020
Did you note it down for me?

129
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:24,780
I did.

130
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,720
Horse Wang.

131
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,830
Your shoulder is bleeding.

132
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,170
You should rest a while.

133
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,830
I must keep going.

134
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,680
I have to toil.

135
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,360
My sins weigh heavily.

136
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,870
I must earn the blessing quota.

137
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,470
Only then can I meet Mistress soon

138
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,360
and gain her blessing.

139
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,780
Alright, back to work.

140
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,270
All family members, off to work!

141
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,240
Come on, time to work.

142
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,160
Time to work.

143
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,010
Move, move.

144
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,060
Mark more for Horse Wang.

145
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:51,920
Hurry, hurry.

146
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,170
Keep up.

147
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:54,040
Go.

148
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,440
- Why not go with them?
- Keep up.

149
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,190
I'll just watch you from here.

150
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,510
Don't we have someone for Mortal Rank?

151
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,230
Yeah.

152
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,480
Family, gather up.

153
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,600
Mortal Rank family.

154
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,630
It's so good to see you all.

155
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,430
Come on, line up.

156
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,710
Form a line, come on, please.

157
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,750
Here, this is yours.

158
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,720
Thanks to Mistress.

159
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,480
This one's for you.

160
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,550
Thank you.

161
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,060
Thank you.

162
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,670
Hold it tight.

163
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,600
Thanks to Mistress.

164
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:26,910
This is yours.

165
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,800
Thanks to Mistress.

166
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,380
Always at Mistress's service.

167
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,720
It's true; it's real gold biscuits!

168
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,600
Thanks to Mistress.

169
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,400
Always at Mistress's service.

170
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,410
Come on.

171
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:37,320
This is yours.

172
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,140
Dear family.

173
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,000
We will deliver these gold biscuits

174
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,030
into your family's hands.

175
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,470
- We...
- Thanks to Mistress.

176
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:46,960
It's a real gold biscuit.

177
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,090
We'll also tell them
you're doing well here.

178
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,250
Thanks to Mistress.

179
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:54,780
I believe each of us will be bestowed

180
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,360
with Mistress's blessing.

181
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,130
Everyone will receive

182
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,010
Mistress's trust.

183
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,560
Aren't you new here?

184
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,670
You don't have one.

185
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,480
I didn't expect it to be true.

186
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,610
I can finally take a wife.

187
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:27,710
Heng.

188
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,220
Everyone here has gone mad.

189
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:32,440
Completely mad.

190
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,360
Even Lan'er has lost her senses.

191
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,500
She wants to serve me
instead of looking for her parents,

192
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,660
calling it a blessing.

193
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,230
Utterly insane.

194
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,640
Well, you are a Heaven Rank man.

195
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,920
Alright, alright.

196
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,640
The way they're behaving

197
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:49,640
is no different from those workers
building your mausoleum.

198
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,150
You know what?

199
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:53,870
Those workers worked faster and better.

200
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,840
Tell me.

201
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,340
Do they really need to go this far
for some gold?

202
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,110
All mortals suffer, Marquis.

203
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,170
Anyway, the gold is clearly unusual.

204
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:08,720
Except for you,

205
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,050
who could have so much gold?

206
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:13,010
You think this gold came from me?

207
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,160
Yeah.

208
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,750
What's your plan?

209
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,230
Let's wait.

210
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,660
Lan'er's gone mad.

211
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,650
What about Senior?

212
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,710
De Jiu.

213
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,480
Isn't this going too far?

214
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,750
I know you.

215
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,160
I don't want you to make a mistake.

216
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,790
I admit I'm no match for you.

217
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,590
Since I can't receive Wang's blessing,

218
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,610
I'll have another family member
give me one.

219
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,030
That should work, right?

220
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,030
Why are you still stopping me?

221
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,290
Because you'll regret it.

222
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,430
This is something I chose willingly.

223
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,760
Why would I regret it?

224
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,390
What does Mistress possess

225
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,000
to make you so fearless?

226
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,840
How dare you!

227
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:59,550
Mistress's abilities

228
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,290
are not for you to speak lightly of.

229
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:02,730
You are a woman, too.

230
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,430
You should understand
her painstaking efforts best.

231
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:06,830
On her own,

232
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,210
she's brought many people
hope and a better life.

233
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,460
To receive her blessing

234
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,110
is a fortune in life.

235
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:14,720
Don't stand in my way.

236
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:19,790
Fortunes in life

237
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,730
need no dependence.

238
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,640
We women have our own choices, too.

239
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:31,940
This is a waste of breath.

240
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:32,880
This is all I can do.

241
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,960
This time, I can't help you.

242
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:37,620
Impressive skills, Senior.

243
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:38,630
Good night.

244
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,000
I heard everything you said.

245
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,360
You were right.

246
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,700
And you acted even better.

247
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,980
Why not send her back?

248
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,340
Consider it to bestow a blessing.

249
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,460
It will fulfill her goodwill.

250
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,530
I should keep a proper distance.

251
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,480
You do it.

252
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:13,990
Are you tired?

253
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,400
Let me walk you back.

254
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:18,540
Get some rest early.

255
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:20,870
I have nowhere to go.

256
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,430
I'll just find somewhere
to get by for the night.

257
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,580
Why?

258
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,610
An Earth Rank girl
chosen by a Heaven Rank

259
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,140
can no longer return.

260
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,360
Then

261
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,500
where are you staying?

262
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,900
What do you think?

263
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,330
This Heaven Rank family member.

264
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,680
I'll show you the way.

265
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,470
I've made up the bed.

266
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,460
Get some rest early.

267
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,340
Please.

268
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,220
Well...

269
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,560
The bedding's just been changed.

270
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,050
It's spotless.

271
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,350
And the water.

272
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,120
I just boiled the hot water.

273
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,820
I added a bit of cool water to it.

274
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,190
Now, the temperature's just right.

275
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:17,300
You can use it right away.

276
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,580
What about you?

277
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,480
Me?

278
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,200
