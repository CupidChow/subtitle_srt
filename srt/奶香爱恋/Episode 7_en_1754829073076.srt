I need your help.

66
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:09,240
I told the owner of a cafe that
I'd do a promotional shoot for his cafe.

67
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,360
Are you free? Can you come and help me?

Korn is currently busy.

69
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:21,839

would be pre-assembled.

71

72
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,200
Okay, give me one second.

73
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,560
Where's the cafe?
Send me the location.

74
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,200
Thank you so much, Phra Aek.

75
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,960

76
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,360

00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,760
Are these photos okay?

88
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,870
They're perfect, Phra Aek.

89
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,480
I think, there's too much
negative space, though.

90
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,840
Can you add more cups to the set?

91
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,240
- Sure. I'll be right back.
- Mm.

92
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,240
That cup should be at the back.

93
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,520
There we go.

94
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
Yeah, form a line.

95
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,680
Oh.

96
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,800
These are some of the examples.

97
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,280
Whoa, boy.

98
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,400
It looks too commercial.

99
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,840
I don't think it looks enticing enough.

100
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,400
We may have to add some desserts
or pair the drinks with snacks,

101
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,770
which can potentially catch
customers' attention.

102
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,600
Mm. That's a great idea.

103
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,080
Shall we do that?

104
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,920
Mm, sure.

105
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,920
Do you have some to spare, though?

106
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,320
We do have some.

107
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,760
There!

108
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,120
Bam! Look at these.

109
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,560
I have no idea that
you've got this stuff lying around.

110
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,440
I bought it for future use.

111
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,040
I intended to open this cafe
as a pastry shop at first,

112
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,400
but it didn't do well at all,

113
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,120
so these tools ended up here.

114
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,320
By the way, do you know how to use them?

115
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,720
Because I don't.

116
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,880
Me neither.

117
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,400
I do.

118
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,080
Really?

119
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,440
You bet.

120
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,120
Give it a go.

121
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,560
- You separate the yolk and the egg whites.
- Okay.

122
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,360
Whoa!

123
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,560
You're skilled!

124
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,040
You really are.

125
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,200
Nom Jued,

126
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,320
why didn't you bring him to work here too?

127
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,160
Just quit being a film student

128
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,240
at this rate!

129
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,920
Agreed.

130
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,360
I was born yesterday knowing that
Phra Aek can make amazing desserts.

131
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,960
Mm!

132
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,240
Honestly, Bro,

133
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,640
this is nothing.

134
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,600

139

How did you manage to do that?

140
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,280
How about this?

141
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,720

142
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,840
Mm.

143
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,440
Pairing drinks with a dessert
sure looks wonderful.

144
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,480
Mm, it really does.

145
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,880
Try taking some shots yourself.

146
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,960
Come on, try it.

147
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,480
Are you sure?

148
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,760
Mm.

149
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,560
Go ahead.

150
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,040
Get a firm grip, okay?

151
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,700
Go for it.

152
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,160
Thank you for helping me out, Phra Aek.

153
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,080
I can't believe you actually know
how to bake pastries.

154
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,110
Why? Is it that shocking?

155
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,480
Well, you look unhygienic.

156
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,480
Wait...

157
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,400
I mean, you look untidy.

158
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,960
Sure, whatever floats your boat.

159
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,640
When I was saving up to buy my first camera,

160
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,360
I had to work in restaurants just like you.

161
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,880
I was just kidding, okay?

162
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,980
Don't be mad at me.

163
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,880
Whatever.

164
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,680
Oh.

165
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,720
This is your payment,

166
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:47,320
and this is for your reimbursement.

167
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,120
Save it for your own drinks.

168
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,140
No!

169
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,760
I've made a promise that
I won't go to other places

170
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,560
until I'm done reimbursing you.

171
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,600
I'll go only if I'm treated to one.

172
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,360
How's that?
Doesn't that sound cool?

173
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,760
Fine, I'll take it.

174
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,760
I'm so ready to have
desserts right now.

175
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,920
By the way, you're working here?

176
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,260
Mm.

177
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,320
I've been working part-time here
so that I can save up to compensate you.

178
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,920
At first, Pai was here with me too,

179
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:40,080
but he got laid off as
he got into an argument with a customer.

180
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,480
I see.

181
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,880
I ran around like a headless chicken today,

182
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,800
but thank you so much, Phra Aek.

183
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,080
You are

184
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,400
amazing, Shortie,

185
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,600
for being able to try something new.

186
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,680
Likewise.

187
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,320
God, if I were that amazing,

188
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,440
I would already be a DoP by now.

189
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,080
Why?

190
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,800
Don't you wanna be a photographer?

191
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,520
Being a photographer

192
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,000
means that if you're not recognized,
you'll be rotting in the dirt.

193
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,880
That's why I've been making names for myself.

194
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,720
You're talented, so I'm sure you can do it.

195
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,160
Good luck!

196
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,160
Phra Aek.

197
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,640
Did you even shower?

198
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,680
What? Why?

199
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,040
I smell nice, though.

200
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,520
I don't stink that bad, do I?

201
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,760
Do I stink that bad?

202
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,160
Hey, bro!

203
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,320
Yes, what is it?

204
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,120
What the hell is going on?

205
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,240
Huh?

206
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,680
After I posted the photos,

207
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,760
we received a ton of orders.

208
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,080
Brother.

209
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,760
Can you teach me how to make it?

210
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,400
Absolutely.

211
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,130
- Why?
- Did you take a shower?

212
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,000
Why?

213
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,720
Whoa! Easy!

214
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,880
You're amazing.

215
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,120
Thank you!

216
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,360
Great job!

217
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,760
Perfect!

218
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,840
- He's awesome, right?
- He is!

219
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,440
I'm gonna dropping another post now.

220
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,880
- Sure.
- This is marvelous!

221
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,280
Let's go!

222
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,320
What are you doing?

223
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,280
Nothing.

224
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,440
I saw that.

225
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,880
You secretly took a photo of me?

226
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,000
Who?

227
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,120
Let me see the photo.

228
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,760
No! No!

229
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,720
No.

230
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,560
I didn't do anything.

231
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,000
It's pretty.

232
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,600
Just a second.

233
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,080
I got a call.

234
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,560
Let me take this call for a minute.

235
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,430
Mm.

236
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,240
What do you think about these photos?

237
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,680
Let me work on my pose for a bit.

238
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,600
I think these photos
look sexy enough already.

239
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,240
That's perfect.

240
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,240
I want the photos to do their job.

241
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,760
I want the audience to be in the mood.

242
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,360
In the mood for what?

243
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,360
I think, it's more like aroused.

244
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,960
What about you?

245
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,240
Are you aroused?

246
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,440
Come on! Get back to the shoot!

Okay, thank you.

253
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,520
Huh? Is something going on?

254
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,960
A client asked me about the price.

255

What are you doing?

256
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,000
You're looking at the photos?

257
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,000
Mm.

258
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,600
What's wrong?

259
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,200
You can't get used to it?

260
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,000
Mm, I can't.

261
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,320
Sometimes, I don't know how to act.

It's fine. I can wait here.

270

- Thank you.

271

Well.

Hungry.

Why did you take us all the way here?

I wanna take you to try something tasty.

It's been so long.

278
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,160
But it's only been a few days.

Why?

283
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,160
You don't want them to lay eyes on me?

284
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,640
Are you

285

possessive of me?

286

Possessive?!

You're crazy.

You don't feel awkward knowing that?

00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,400
No.

290
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,520
I don't

291
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,160

Who?

00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:15,840

However,

313

I started it when I was in grade 11.

321
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,600
And why are you into photography?

322
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:37,760
I was simply into someone's work.

323
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,640
After that, I became a fan.

324
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,120

That's pretty much it, I guess.

I think it's very expressive, though.

00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,400
I'll give it a shot.

374
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,880
That's why I wanna study here.

375
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,120
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

376
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,680
That's great.

377
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,480
Oh...

378
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,480
Do you actually need this many snacks?

379
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,280
If you wanna win Nom Jued's heart,

380
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,880
you just have to show him you're into him.

381
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,120
Also...

382
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,520
You need to treat his friends, too.

383
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,440
Huh?

384
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,920
Treating Nom Jued's friends?

385
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:55,940
Yeah.

386
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,200
Whoa.

387
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,880
Okay, let's go to the cashier.

388
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,760
Let's go.

389
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,000
Whoa!

390
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,040
[I'm sorry for not being there to help you,
so enjoy these snacks with your friends]

391
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,600
How am I supposed to finish
all of the snacks myself?

392
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,920
How come Kornthep good-looking
and kind at the same time?

393
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,960
Honestly, if you were treated
by this type of person,

394
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,080
I wouldn't have to worry about you.

395
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,080
Who's Korn?

396
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,480
He's that art student.

397
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,440
Fucking hell.

398
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,360
You want Nom Jued to be with those guys?

399
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,280
Listen.

400
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,080
He seems different from the rest,

401
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,560
like a black sheep in a herd.

402
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,320
He seems diligent,

403
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,520
and he's also the President
of the Photography Club.

404
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,750
I bet heâ€™s got feelings for Nom Jued.

405
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,560
That's enough, Pai.

406
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,360
He just felt guilty for not being able to help me
do a shoot at the cafe.

407
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,920
By the way, how did you pull through?

408
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,620
The photos were amazing.

409
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,520
Who?

410
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,280
I really wanna see his face.

411
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,860
Everyone says he's the hot guy.

412
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,960
I wonder how handsome Kornthep is.

413
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,040
Look at this, Pai.

414
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,040
The cafe has gained a lot of attention.

415
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:03,760
Whoa!

416
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,680
Give it back!

417
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,560
Hey!

418
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,360
Give it back!

419
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,520
Hey.

420
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,000
The cafe is probably busy.

421
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,440
I don't think I'll have time for Korn.

422
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,760
It's whatever.

423
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,900
Here's your order, ma'am.

424
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,140
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

425
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,100
Welcome! What would you like to order?

426
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:51,210
We'll have this one and that one.

427
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:52,180
This one.

428
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,220
- This one, too, right?
- Uh, yes.

429
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,940
- And one with the cheese foam, please.
- Sure.

430
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:56,580
- Uh...
- That's all.

431
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,300
Please take a seat and wait.

432
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,180
Your drinks will be served at your table.

433
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,580
This place's busy today, isn't it?

434
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,940
Yes, sir.

435
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,480
Oh, Korn!

436
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,340
I've been busy today,
so I didn't reply to your messages.

437
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,040
I'll get back to that shortly.

438
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,280
Oh, Korn.

439
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,719
I'll help.

440
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,639
Sure.

441
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,800
Can you do the cashier

442
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,960
and serve the drinks?

443
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,760
- Mm.
- Okay, just give me a moment.

444
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,190
Welcome.

445
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,280
- I'll have a cup of Nom Mhee strawberry frappe.
- Sure.

446
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,960
- Your drink will be served at your table, ma'am.
- Thank you.

447
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,560
A cup of Nom Mhee strawberry frappe, please.

448
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,840
Here you go.

449
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,480
Whoa.

450
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,600
This place is gorgeous.

451
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,000
By the way, what is this?

452
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,240
I told you I'd treat you to dinner.

453
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,000
The restaurant is closed,

454
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,440
so I prepared the dishes myself.

455
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,320
It's okay if you wanna treat me later.

456
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,880
I don't wanna postpone it anymore.

457
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,840
Thanks, Korn.

458
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,400
How was the cafe?

459
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:21,480
Recently, it's been very bustling
with customers.

460
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,960
I have no idea where they're coming from.

461
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,320
But we were lucky that
the owner wasn't here today.

462
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:30,440
Or else I'd have to
keep working there until the next day.

463
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,560
You've done a spectacular job, Nom Jued.

464
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,100
Come on. Let's dig in.

465
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,080
[Phra Aek, The Most Handsome Face]

466
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,360
Would you like to answer the phone?

467
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,720
It's okay.

468
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,280
Let's continue.

469
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,960
Can I ask you a question?

470
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:15,880
Mm.

471
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:21,280
Do I still stand a chance to win your heart?

472
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,240
Win my heart?

473
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,400
Mm, yes.

474
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,360
What is this about, Korn?

475
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,960
I've gotta be honest with you.

476
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,520
I don't know what that means.

477
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,640
Well...

478
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,520
It's to become your lover.

479
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,280
And...

480
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,760
How would that be different
from what I am now?

481
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,400
It'll be slightly different.

482
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,880
I'm serious about this, by the way.

483
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,720
You can take your time to think about it.

484
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,480
Ouch!

485
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,550
What happened, Nom Jued?

486
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,880
Something got into my eye.

487
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,040
Ow.

488
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:18,880
Is it love?

489
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,840
Huh? What did you say?

490
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:33,760
Has it gone away?

491
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,240
Uh.

492
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,440
It's gone now.

493
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,160
Give it a try, Nom Jued.

494
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,280
It's really tasty.

495
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,780
I put my heart into it just for you.

496
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,520
Mm.

497
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,300
Shit!

498
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,560
Is Korn for real?

499
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,400
No wonder Nom Jued
didn't pick up the phone.

500
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,400
What should I do?

501
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,520
Oh...

502
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,000
Whoa!

503
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,200
Finally!

504
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,120
Come here!

505
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,760
- This way!
- Hold on!

506
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,360
Quickly!

507
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,720
Why did you ask me to come here?

508
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,600
I...

509
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,440
I wanna look cool.

510
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,200
You, of all people?!

511
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,320
What makes you wanna look cool
all of a sudden?

512
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,400
Well...

513
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,440
People wanna change themselves sometimes.

514
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,320
What do you want me to do then?

515
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,080
God.

516
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,440
You wake up looking handsome every day,

517
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,520
so you've gotta have a way or two to help me.

518
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,280
Huh?

519
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,360
Go easy on me.

520
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,520
What?

521
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,840
Whoa!

522
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,320
Mm!

523
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,830
What's that?

524
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,810
- How long do I have to leave this on?
- This should work.

525
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,760
Come here.

526
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,360
Whoa! Calm down!

527
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:58,960
How is it?

528
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,880
Sheesh!

529
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,120
I do look cool now.

530
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,800
So I can look handsome.

531
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,800
Take care of yourself sometimes.

532
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,720
- Get it?
- Right.

533
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,080
- Do I look good?
- Yeah.

534
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,320
- I do, right?
- Okay.

535
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,120
Does my hair look okay?

536
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,800
Be sure to study quantum mechanics as well.

537
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:43,470
That's it for today.

538
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:44,390
Class dismissed.

539
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,190
Who's "Phra Aek, The Most Handsome Face"?

540
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:55,510
It's the antique shop guy.

541
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:56,670
I'll be right back.

542
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:12,210
"When will you return my key card?"

543
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,070
Hello?

544
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,120
You've been ignoring my calls, haven't you?

545
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,760
You're not paying your debt, are you?

546
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,600
I'm not.

547
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,320
I won't ditch you; I promise.

548
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,640
What about the key card?

549
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,240
When are you gonna give it back?

550
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:35,520
I totally forgot about it, Phra Aek.

551
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,480
I thought you were keeping it to rob my place.

552
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,680
No, I would never do such a thing.

553
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,200
By the way,
I only have morning classes today.

554
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,080
Meet me at the faculty building, okay?

555
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,480
I'm not at the college today.

556
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,560
Oh.

557
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,240
You're skipping your class today?

558
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,010
Why don't you focus on your studies?

559
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,290
You're such a bad boy, Phra Aek.

560
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,680
Fuck off.

561
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,480
You're being rude again.

562
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,720
Whatever. It's none of your business.

563
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,240
Can I return it to you tomorrow then?

564
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,520
I want the key card today, though.

565
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,720
Well...

566
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,360
- I'll come to your place.
- Mm.

567
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:16,760
Come here by a taxi

568
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,200
or else you'll get lost again.

569
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,410
Mm.

570
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Where are you going, Nom?

571
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:34,040
Uh... I'm heading home.

572
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,080
Tell that to a three-year-old.

573
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,360
What's that key card all about?

574
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,680
Oh, I'm returning it to

575
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,520
Phra Aek.

576
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,120
Return what?

577
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,440
Where's the location?

578
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,680
And when are you returning it?

579
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:50,960
Tell us everything.

580
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,240
I'm returning his key card

581
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,120
at Phra Aek's condo

582
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,520
right now.

583
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,320
It's Phra Aek again?

584
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,120
Since when did you take his key card?

585
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:05,960
It was a long time ago.

586
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:10,600
He was sick, and I was at the club room.

587
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,560
So I volunteered, taking him to his place.

588
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,920
You even did that?

589
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,800
Did he try tricking you?

590
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,080
Calm down, guys.

591
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,440
Why didn't you hand it to his friends?

592
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,720
I notice that you're close to them.

593
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,840
I already told Phra Aek
that I'm heading to his place, though.

594
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,520
- That's a no.
- That's a no-go.

595
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,360
Why not?

596
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,080
I won't get lost on my way there.

597
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,360
I'm sure I can make it there.

598
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,880
So you're going there regardless, right?

599
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,880
I have to return what I've borrowed, right?

600
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,480
Right.

601
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,360
Go ahead.

602
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:47,880
But we're coming with you.

603
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,640
Huh?! You guys are coming with me?

604
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,320
Pai, you live here too, right?

605
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,080
Yes, I do live here.

606
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,360
Which floor does he live on, though?

607
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:04,500
Yeah.

608
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,040
Whoa, Phra Aek!

609
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,160
What did you do?

610
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,170
I did nothing.

611
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,080
Why are you better-looking,

612
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,120
as if you've showered hundreds of times?

613
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:34,880
Nom.

614
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,000
Just give him back his key card

615
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,400
so we can leave.

616
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,440
Wait, who are they?

617
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:43,760
Hey, Rong.

618
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,210
Hey, you!

619
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,040
How did you get here?

620
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:53,150
I have no idea that you have
a younger brother, Phra Aek.

621
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,120
What?

622
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:01,280
It's your key card, right?

623
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:03,680
Here.

624
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,080
Now that's done,

625
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,400
we're heading home.

626
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,320
Let's go.

627
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:12,440
Wait.

628
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:17,360
Why does your brother look so familiar?

629
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:20,640
What?

630
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:23,160
You messed with Nom Jued?

631
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,680
What? It did nothing.

632
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,080
Oh...

633
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,440
So you two are related.

634
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,880
No wonder your names sound so weird,

635
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,640
Phra Aek and Phra Rong.

636
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:34,920
- Whoa.
- What?

637
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:38,380
I think one of you looks more like
the main character than the other.

638
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,120
Why are you laughing, non-essential characters?

639
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,600
- Hey!
- Whoa.

640
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,360
And...

641
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,000
Why are you so handsome-looking?

642
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,200
Are you attending an event or something?

643
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:54,840
I just wanna look more handsome.

644
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:56,930
Is it that big of a deal?

645
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:00,820
Let's leave, guys.

646
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,880
I'm done with these posers.

647
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,360
- Wait.
- Whoa...

648
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,840
I'll catch you later.

649
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:06,960
Bye-bye!

650
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,030
Bye.

651
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,360
You know one of Nom Jued's friends?

652
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,170
Yes, I talked to him from time to time.

653
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:25,320
By the way, why did he have your key card?

654
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,080
Uh...

655
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,610
He's a senior,

656
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,360
a club senior.

657
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,600
So you're spending a night here or what?

658
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:36,640
Of course, I am.

659
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,800
But I'll be outside for a minute or two.

660
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,440
Give me your key card.

661
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:42,560
No.

662
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:43,640
Why not?

663
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:46,040
It's for someone else.

664
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,160
What the fuck?

665
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:49,820
How am I supposed to get back here?

666
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:55,320
- Give it to me!
- Whoa!

667
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,640
Mm...

668
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,480
I wanna take nude photos of a man.

669
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,960
I wanna know what physique
I should look for to get results like this.

670
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,280
Beauty.

671
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:30,760
Are you almost done?

672
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,280
Give me a moment.

673
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:35,990
I'm thinking about how to make them look good.

674
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:39,680
Oh.

675
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,760
Do you have to be that close, though?

676
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,010
What?

677
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,160
My eyesight is bad, no?

678
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,760
I've been constantly blinded by camera flashes.

679
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,280
Let's give this a go.

680
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:21,720
Nice, nice.

681
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:27,760
That's the good stuff.

682
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:31,200
Hey.

683
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,240
How's it going, Phra Aek?

684
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:34,480
How's your assignment?

685
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,840
I'm doing some research.

686
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:40,520
More importantly,
however, I need money, too.

687
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,560
Yeah, you're right.

688
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:48,840
Aside from passion,
money is just as important.

689
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:51,720
Hey.

690
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,520
Professor Chat wants me to compete
against Korn again.

691
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,840
You've been each other's rival since last year.

692
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:02,440
At the end of the day,
you're gonna win anyway

693
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,360
because you've got skills.

694
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,640
Kornthep is just a hot kid here at the faculty,

695
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:08,980
so don't be so serious.

696
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,120
It's true.

697
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:11,760
You're right.

698
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,080
Alright.

699
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,320
Let's find something new to do.

700
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:20,720
I think I'm gonna ride out
and find new shooting locations.

701
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,160
Huh?

702
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:25,120
With...

703
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,700
With that motorcycle?

704
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:29,880
It's been with you for ages.

705
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,400
Hasn't it kicked the bucket already?

706
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:33,240
Be careful with your words.

707
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:34,720
Call it the "Little Guy".

708
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:36,400
From now on, it's called Little Guy.

709
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:37,800
Get it?

710
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,360
What Little Guy?

711
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:44,880
Fine.

712
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,520
Little Guy it is.

713
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,520
Why aren't you riding a different motorbike?

714
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:49,920
Well...

715
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,520
Rong's riding it.

716
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,960
I know that your family
owns so many motorbikes.

717
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,560
Then there's your dad's possession
as a cherry on top.

718
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,840
Whose? My dad's?

719
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:06,120
He never lets me borrow his rides.

720
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,280
He manages to sell buffaloes,

721
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:09,920
but not his motorbikes.

722
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,680
That's ridiculous.

723
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:13,160
Right.

724
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:14,960
Just get one.

725
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,240
Get a new one already.

726
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:22,320
Wait...

727
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:26,640
Is this the short film that Beauty starred in?

728
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:27,720
Yeah.

729
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:29,380
You're revisiting the project?

730
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,320
I'm tying up loose ends.

731
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:38,120
Listen. We're already overwhelmed
by the exhibition project.

732
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,840
You're working on another project
on top of that?

733
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:41,400
Mm.

734
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:43,840
That's ridiculous.

735
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,360
Look.

736
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:49,880
It's still raining.

737
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,280
How am I gonna make it home?

738
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:53,840
Yeah.

739
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:55,720
It's raining cats and dogs.

740
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:58,280
When is it gonna stop?

741
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:02,520
Wait.

742
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,360
I'll be right back.

743
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:13,520
Hey!

744
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:22,960
It's always me, isn't it?

745
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:25,000
Fine.

746
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,950
Master Chat has entered the chat.

747
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,600
Just you wait.

748
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,400
The real show is about to begin.

749
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,680
Shortie, are you stupid or insane?

750
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,160
Here. Dry yourself.

751
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,280
Dry your hair, too.

752
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,320
I'm working on it.

753
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:01,590
Here.

754
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:09,800
Ow! Ow! Phra Aek!

755
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:13,770
Keep drying it.

756
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,000
- Ow!
- You're gonna catch a cold.

757
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,800
Be gentle, Phra Aek.

758
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,240
You're making me bald at this rate.

759
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:21,640
Whatever.

760
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,120
Here. Get changed.

761
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:03,800
Whoa! What are you doing, Phra Aek?!

762
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:05,520
Getting changed, of course.

763
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,360
Do you want me to freeze to death?

764
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,680
You're doing it here?

765
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:10,800
Of course.

766
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:12,080
Why?

767
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:28,360
Head home after it stops raining, get it?

768
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:30,770
Mm.

769
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,520
Where are all your friends?

770
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:39,080
Oh.

771
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,960
Phrab and Pai have already left.

772
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:45,840
Those guys...

773
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,560
Take some pills when you get home, okay?

774
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:51,680
Mm.

775
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:53,440
Thank you.

776
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:55,570
Mm.

777
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:21,520
Heading home?

778
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,280
Yes, I'm about to.

779
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,600
You're giving me a ride home?

780
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:27,120
No.

781
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:30,160
See you, then.

782
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,120
Have a safe journey home.

783
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:34,280
Wait! I'm kidding!

784
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,320
I'm giving you a ride.

785
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:37,880
If you want me to do so,

786
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:39,760
you've gotta wear this.

787
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:53,440
I think you need to see a psychiatrist soon.

788
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:55,960
Why? What do you think I have?

789
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,190
Being hypocritical.

790
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:00,720
What? Do you wanna fall off the motorbike?

791
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:03,080
No! No! I wanna head home!

792
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,240
Let's go.

793
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:06,120
Okay, okay.

794
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:07,720
Hold on tight.

795
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:12,000
- I'm going full throttle, okay?
- Mm.

796
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,040
Here.

797
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,400
Thank you, Phra Aek, the Kind.

798
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:35,440
Mm.

799
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,600
You are my real superhero.

800
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,160
What superhero?

801
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:43,040
The green guy.

802
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:46,480
The Hulk?

803
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,000
Nope, it's Shrek.

804
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:50,760
Shrek my ass.

805
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:54,360
Get inside already.

806
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,520
Take care of Little Guy, okay?

807
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:01,160
Nom Jued.

808
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:11,360
What is it, Phra Aek?

809
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:20,760
Would you be my boyfriend?

810
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,120
Is it really that bad being with me?

811
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:43,320
Yeah.

812
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,080
What do you mean, Phra Aek?
