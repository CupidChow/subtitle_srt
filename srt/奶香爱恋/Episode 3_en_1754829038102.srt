123
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,250

124

It's the key chain that I gave you.

129
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,820
What? Don't just randomly say things.

130
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,690
How would my stuff be yours?

131
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,080
It's yours, I guess.

132

133
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,590
Off with that expression.

134
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,370
Dig in.

135
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:23,330
You're not hungry?

136
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,330
I'm not gonna steal your food.

137
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,050
I'll have a meal when I'm home.

138
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,370

139

140
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:34,900

141
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:38,630
Then dig in.

142
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,000
Make sure you finish it, too.

143
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:44,130

145
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,760
I can't even pay you in full at this rate.

146
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,080
Whatever. Finish it then.

150

I told you to finish it.

151
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,400
Or else, you'll have to pay extra.

152
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,040
Are you always this mean
to all of your debtors?

153
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,650
No.

154
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,140
It's just you.

155
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,980
Wash the plate after you're done.

156
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,600

157
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,070

160
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,880
Hey! What the fuck did you just do?

161
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,640
Don't scold me.

162
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,610
What's wrong with you, yelling into my ears?

163
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,170
Well, I...

164
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,500
What's wrong?
Something's stuck in your throat?

165
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,350
I was about to head home,

166
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,190
but I realized that

167
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,370
a key card is required for the door.

168
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,250
After heading up here to ask for it,

169
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,840
a side pillow got dropped.

170
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,890
Then...

171
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,160
- Uh...
- Huh?

172
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,440
Finish what you were saying.

173
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,640
Don't mutter your words.

174
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,850
It was nothing.

175
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,360
You dare lie to me, Jued?

176
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:47,810
Ow!

177
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,440
What?

178
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,670
I did something to you after that?

179
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,840
It hurts.

180
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,370
I can't hug you, can I?

181
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,760
It's just a hug,
why are you screaming over it?

182
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,070
But what you did
was more like sexual assault.

183
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,440
So you hugging me the other day
isn't a sexual assault?

184
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,320
It came from my good intention.

185
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,720
So did what I just did.

186
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,000
Ouch! I'm heading home.

187
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,600
Just go then.

188
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,820
You've been shackled or something?

189
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,360
Can I borrow your key card?

190
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,530
It's on the nightstand.

191
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,920
When do I return it to you?

192
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,090
I probably won't get to come here often.

193
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,120
Just come more often then.

194
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,850
Why do I have to do that?

195
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,330
God!

196
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,870
Just leave.

197
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,180
Quickly now.

198
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,050
Let's just get it over with.

199
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,130
Whoa...

200
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,200
We're not gonna make it.

201
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,710
We have to set things up, too.

202
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,850
Yeah.

203
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,430
I've got my own projects to work on.

204
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,140
I also help with the faculty projects.

205
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,810
I guess I won't have time to do anything else.

206
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,840
Are you guys okay, Beauty and Yingyam?

207
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,910
No, we're not.

208
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,840
At this rate, we won't finish it
by the end of the month.

209
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:26,680
Somchat, what do you think?

210
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,400
The project launches at month-end.

211
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,880
How can we make it work?

212
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,630
I mean, it's possible...

213
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,250
No, we can't make it work.

214
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,440
We were just given the concept yesterday.

215
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,050
The deadline's the end of the month, too.

216
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,440
We also have to set up an exhibition

217
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,030
so that we can get the funding.

218
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,630
This is absurd.

219
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,710
Right?

220
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,360
Just get it done.

221
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,550
At least our faculty
is more visible to the public.

222
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,460
It also allows people
to see more of our work.

223
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,540
Maybe we might get funded.

224
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,990
I guess you're right.

225
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,200
With this amount of people,

226
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,680
it can't be done.

227
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:08,090
Also, we only have
this many club members left.

228
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,320
It's over.

229
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,630
- Mm.
- That's right.

230
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,730
What if we brought
new club members on board?

231
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,640
Yeah! Good idea!

232
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,110
But will they weigh us down?

233
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,520
No idea.

234
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,910
I'm so upset.

235
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,590
What's the criteria
for accepting club members?

236
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,920
- Connections.
- Oh, damn...

237
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,920
Keng's work is so good
that it can be featured at an exhibition.

238
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,430
But he didn't get accepted.

239
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,340
Feel free to sit here.

240
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,440
Thank you.

241
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:58,240
My name is Nom Jued, a science student.

242
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,580
Wait, you're not an art student?

243
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,620
I did a photoshoot, too, right?

244
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,790
Mm, yeah.

245
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,050
My name is Ploy, an economics student.

246
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,060
How many people do you know here?

247
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,700
- You're a newcomer, too?
- Yeah.

248
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,620
Do you mind if I sit here?

249
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,760
I'm Nong Noey, an art freshman.

250
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,260
My name's Ploy, an economics sophomore.

251
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,490
I'm Nom Jued,

252
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,200
a science junior.

253
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,320
You're so cool,
shooting photos with your phone camera.

254
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,360
Thank you.

255
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,800
You're awesome yourself.

256
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,200
You look like you're fairly experienced.

257
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,060
Thank you.

258
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm not that experienced, actually.

259
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,370
I just started.

260
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,290
Mm...

261
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,760
Do you know...

262
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,800
Hello.

263
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,110
I'm Kornthep,

264
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,840
the President of Photography Club.

265
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,000
Alright.

266
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:04,130
This room is for our club members.

267
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,360
If you'd like to work or hang out here,

268
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,360
feel free to do so.

269
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,320
Without further ado,

270
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,080
Let's get to the next activity.

271
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,800
Somchat.

272
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,090
Alright!

273
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,960
Next up, we're gonna find out
who your Club Senior will be.

274
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,210
This position is also known as

275
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,980
Club Assistant.

276
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:33,580
I'd like you to pay attention to
the color of your paper wristband

277
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,280
and see which senior it matches with.

278
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:41,050
The senior that you're matched with
is your Club Senior.

279
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,280
If you're ready,

280
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,960
let's go!

281
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,510
Yay!

282
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,110
Alright! Find your group members.

283
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,760
Green?

284
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,000
- Are yours yellow?
- I'm yellow.

285
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,170
Anyone got a brown wristband? I'm right here.

286
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,770
Phra Aek.

287
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,040
Our color's the same.

288
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,359
What's your name, and what year are you?

289
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,560
I'm Nong Noey,

290
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,660
an art freshman.

291
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,609
We've met each other before.

292
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,190
I'm not sure if you recognize me, though.

293
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,760
Really?

294
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,599
I can't.

295
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,960
Do you know how to do the lighting?

296
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,319
I do.

297
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,790
I guess you can help me with that.

298
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:28,880
Sure.

299
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,080
This is all of us, right?

300
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,120
I think so.

301
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,960
Let's introduce ourselves, shall we?

302
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,480
- I'm Ploy.
- My name is Louis.

303
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,170
- I'm Saifah.
- Okay.

304
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,920
I'm Yingyam.

305
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,050
Feel free to ask me anything.

306
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,010
Mm, Beauty.

307
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,600
I've seen that you enjoy
doing nude self-portraits.

308
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,220
I'm curious to know how you started.

309
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,600
Huh? What was that?

310
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,750
I mean...

311
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,340
How did you start becoming a nude model?

312
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,210
Oh, well...

313
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,680
I just wanted to test
the photographer and the audience.

314
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,710
"Test the photographer?"

315
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,430
If you want someone to care for you,
feel free to test my heart.

316
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,280
What? Don't get too ahead of yourself now.

317
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,900
Oh...

318
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,030
Hello, Kornthep.

319
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,020
I'm Nom Jued.

320
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,590
You can just call me Korn.

321
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,800
We study the same year, no?

322
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,310
If you, Kornthep... Sorry!

323
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,160
I'm fine with whatever you're okay with.

324
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,270
You're part of the club now.

325
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,340
I might be a little bit busy,

326
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,620
but I'll try my best to assist all of you.

327
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,800
Also, feel free to ask me anything.

328
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,920
Feel free to ask me
for a helping hand as well, Korn.

329
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,000
Sure thing.

330
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,080
Pai!

331
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,070
Huh?

332
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,050
Are you alright?

333
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,240
I'm fine.

334
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:30,090
I'm sorry for not helping you out
at the cafe the other day.

335
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,040
How's the cafe doing?

336
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,680
It's doing well.

337
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,560
By the way, how's your savings going
for the reimbursement?

338
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,330
Well...

339
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,330
I've already saved up some money for that.

340
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,640
I'm still trying, though.

341
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,910
Right. Be careful
when you're at the FAA building.

342
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,630
People there are kinda weird.

343
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,450
Those bastards also look mean.

344
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,840
Tell me if they did something bad to you.

345
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,080
Don't worry, Pai.

346
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,400
It's gonna be fine.

347
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,410
Hey.

348
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,700
Why are you wolfing it down?

349
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,620
I've gotta be at the club.

350
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,320
I have work to do there.

351
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,600
But I promise you that
I'll be there to help you at the cafe.

352
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,100
I've been practicing nailing the recipe.

353
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,550
Right. Just...

354
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,560
Do what you can.

355
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,900
I've gotta go now, Pai.

356
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,460
I'll text you later, okay?

357
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,560
Whoa!

358
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,050
Your work looks so neat, Korn.

359
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,540
Oh, you're here?

360
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,860
You arrived so early.

361
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:01,720
Mm.

362
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,850
I always leave for places early.

363
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,360
Is there anything I can help with?

364
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,030
You can...

365
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,780
help me frame this piece.

366
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,170
Let's do it.

367
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,510
Sure.

368
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,380
Why does every element of
your photo look so symmetric?

369
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,990
It's like they're precisely measured.

370
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,360
Really?

371
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,510
How does the photo make you feel?

372
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:31,860
You probably live by certain principles.

373
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,680
I get it, though.

374
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,540
In my class,

375
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,950
my professor always wanted me to prove
countless physics formulas.

376
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,240
How is it, Professor?

377
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,560
Do you like it?

378
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,910
I certainly do, but...

379
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,480
This collection looks lifeless.

380
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,420
Lifeless?

381
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,970
What do you mean, Professor?

382
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,060
It's hard to explain when it comes to art.

383
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,970
I think you...

384
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,370
You utilized too much of the theories.

385
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:19,070
How about presenting
the story and emotions instead?

386
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,720
If I change up my style,

387
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,710
will you submit my work to a global contest

388
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,600
just like Phra Aek's?

389
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,160
You still have time left,

390
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,170
so give it a shot.

391
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,870
Your photo is pretty cool, Korn.

392
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,800
Thank you.

393
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,180
Is there a problem, Phra Aek?

394
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,830
Nothing.

395
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:23,980
Beauty.

396
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,790
Where should I put this photo?

397
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,240
Just put it wherever you want.

398
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,320
I've gotta go.

399
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,660
It's that cheater.

400
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,660
Oh?

401
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,640
How's it going?

402
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,260
How's work?

403
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,130
It's going well.

404
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,680
With the help of the club members,
things are so much easier.

405
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,110
Try to do things yourself sometimes.

406
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,280
How about spending that time on the project
instead of going on a date?

407
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,000
It's called seeking inspiration

408
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,040
from reality.

409
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,990
Right, right, right.

410
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,700
Girl, our project will miss the deadline.

411
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,820
What about your part? Is it done?

412
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,980
I've noticed that

413
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,800
the girl helped you out a lot.

414
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,090
Oh, there are still a lot more things to do.

415
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,440
She's kinda great, though,

416
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,770
despite studying at a different faculty.

417
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,590
Right.

418
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,940
She's more important to you, huh?

419
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,280
What's wrong with you?

420
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:58,900
Nothing.

421
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,430
I'm getting back to work.

422
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Oh, Nom Jued!

423
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,680
Hi, Nong Noey.

424
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,240
You're here by yourself?

425
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,280
That's right.

426
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,680
Where's Phra Aek?

427
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,260
Uh...

428
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,560
He's still not here.

429
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,260
Since he's still not here,

430
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:34,410
I guess,

431
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,880
this cup is for you.

432
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,200
Uh...

433
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,140
What's this drink?

434
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,930
It's black coffee.

435
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,590
Where did you get this?

436
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,470
No, I made it myself.

437
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,690
I'm working part-time at Nom Mhee Cafe,
a cafe by the college.

438
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,560
Feel free to swing by.

439
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,040
Sure thing.

440
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,010
Well then...

441
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,440
I've gotta go now.

442
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,720
Wait, Nom Jued.

443
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,380
I have something to ask you.

444
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:10,890
What is it?

445
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,500
There's not something between you and...

446
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,650
Phra Aek, right?

447
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,720
Nom Jued.

448
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,200
- Oh, Phra Aek.
- You're here to see me?

449
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,290
And what's this?

450
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,470
- Is it black coffee?
- Mm!

451
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,720
Hey!

452
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,840
What? It's not for me?

453
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,160
No.

454
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,100
You're late.

455
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,330
I already gave yours to Nong Noey.

456
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,400
Then whose cup is it?

457
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,900
It's for Korn.

458
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,830
You're giving it to Korn?

459
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,560
Yeah.

460
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,170
I made it myself too.

461
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,760
You made it?

462
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,690
What do you mean?

463
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,960
Nom Jued works part-time at Nom Mhee Cafe

464
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,650
Huh?!

465
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,740
It's just like what he said.

466
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,200
This way, I can reimburse you more quickly.

467
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,360
We need to talk.

468
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:17,870
Huh? What's with you, Phra Aek?

469
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,320
- Come here.
- Where are we going?

470
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,880
The ice is melting.

471
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,770
Come!

472
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,200
Where are we going?

473
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,360
- Just come with me.
- Nom Jued.

474
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,480
Oh, Korn!

475
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:27,960
Phra Aek.

476
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,720
What are you doing to my group member?

477
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,480
It's nothing, Korn.

478
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,840
Are you sure?

479
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,100
Yes.

480
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,630
Nom Jued.

481
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,400
I made you this cup of black coffee.

482
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,760
Thank you.

483
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,050
But...

484
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,960
My hands are full of chemicals, though.

485
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,240
Then...

486
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,760
I'll feed you.

487
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:10,900
It's tasty, actually.

488
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,500
You can have it, by the way.

489
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,950
I haven’t taken a sip.

490
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,170
I don't want it.

491
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,190
I never knew you'd enjoy
these kinds of flavorful dishes.

492
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:55,700
Mm.

493
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,220
I enjoy them, though.

494
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,940
So do I.

495
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,090
Oh...

496
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:05,580
When we met each other at the bar the other day,

497
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,910
you were there with your friend, right?

498
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:10,400
Mm.

499
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,700
It's Yingyam.

500
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,960
Without her,
I would've lost control of myself.

501
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,160
Mm...

502
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,560
You two drink often?

503
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,700
If we're dating,

504
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,970
can I ask you to stop drinking

505
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,450
or drink less?

506
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,520
Sure,

507
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,140
I guess.

508
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,240
Can I say something?

509
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:42,720
It...

510
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,550
It looks like you don't wanna
spend time with me, Beauty.

511
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,430
It's not a one-way street, you know.

512
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,620
You're always like this.

513
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,000
I do wanna spend time with you.

514
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,800
Why would I be here if I don't?

515
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:00,130
It's just that I've been so busy that

516
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,340
I can't focus on anything.

517
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:03,900
I don't know.

518
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:07,540
It seems like
you've got something on your mind.

519
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,630
I'm not just your respite.

520
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,880
I, too, am very busy

521
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,760
just like you.

522
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,970
I have to study my notes
and prepare for the exam.

523
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,140
I've got so much on my hands, too.

524
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,830
I'm sorry.

525
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:27,660
I've been caught up in so many things.

526
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,500
With the projects and everything...

527
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,340
I haven't had much sleep either.

528
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,620
That's why I'm a little bit tired.

529
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,860
However, I'm having an exhibition.

530
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,340
I'd like you to visit it.

531
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,530
Mm.

532
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,810
Just give me the date.

533
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,620
Hey! It's mine!

534
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,530
What?

535
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,440
I thought you were not having it.

536
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,950
I am. See?

537
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,360
Let me eat it in front of you.

538
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,460
- Hey! Hey!
- See?

539
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,760
God, you're such a glutton.

540
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,800
Let me have another piece.

541
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,180
No!

542
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,870
That piece is still in your mouth, though!

543
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,190
I pray to all the light bulbs
in front of me.

544
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,480
May it choke you to death.

545
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,720
It's so good!

546
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,180
Are you serious, Pai?

547
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,790
How can you be so sure

548
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,260
that he's the one giving negative reviews?

549
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:45,290
We messed up so many orders on our first day.

550
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,440
Yeah, you're right.

551
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:56,020
I don't know. I'm going with my gut
and how much I dislike him.

552
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:59,570
You can't do that
with this kind of matter, though.

553
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,380
We need evidence.

554
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:04,820
Just look at what he did.

555
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,870
How irritating!

556
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,440
But...

557
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,080
This person seems familiar.

558
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,720
A regular customer, maybe?

559
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:16,900
You're damn right.

560
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,080
Better prepare yourself.

561
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:19,750
Next time,

562
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,220
he'll have a piece of me.

563
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,420
Calm down, Pai.

564
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,090
There's no need for violence.

565
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:28,790
Let's find a way to restore
the reputation of this cafe.

566
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,360
It can't be done.

567
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:36,000
These days, forgiveness is not the answer.

568
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,920
I'll put him in his place.

569
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,240
We're closed.

570
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,320
Nom Jued.

571
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,400
Oh, Korn!

572
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,670
Mm!

573
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,660
It's as great as ever.

574
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,040
I came all the way here just for your drink.

575
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,900
Thank you, Korn.

576
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,360
Are you done with your work?

577
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:10,080
If there's anything I can help with,
please let me know.

578
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,440
It's all done, actually.

579
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,080
All that is left is to be there on the real day.

580
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,489
And...

581
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,739
Do you want anything for the exhibition day?

582
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:23,510
Maybe flowers?

583
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,320
But...

584
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,150
Please don't ask
for a fancy flower bouquet.

585
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,980
I don't think I can afford one.

586
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,889
It's fine.

587
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:35,860
Just be there.

588
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,520
No need to waste anything.

589
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,449
Nom Jued.

590
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,170
How long is your friend going to

591
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,170
stare at me?

592
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,949
Probably for a long while.

593
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,780
My friend is more protective of me
than my mom!

594
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,700
Oh.

595
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,660
Korn, that's Pai.

596
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,580
He's my friend from the same faculty.

597
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,080
Mm.

598
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,340
Pai,

599
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,770
this is Kornthep.

600
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,160
He's an art student.

601
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:20,970
Huh?!

602
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,440
You're an art student?

603
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,660
You look like an accounting student.

604
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,640
He's the President
of the Photography Club, too.

605
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:33,120
So he's in the same club as that guy?

606
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,610
He's a complete opposite.

607
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,520
It's like two sides of a coin.

608
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,070
Don't say that, Pai!

609
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,730
Nice to meet you.

610
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:45,520
At any rate,

611
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,410
please take care of him, okay?

612
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,770
Sure.

613
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,400
I'm a grown-up now.

614
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,680
I can take care of myself.

615
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,680
No need to say that to him.

616
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,280
Next week, if you're free,

617
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,320
feel free to visit our exhibition,
a photo exhibition.

618
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,400
I'll be there, too!

619
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,670
- You will?
- Of course!

620
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,760
Enjoy, Korn.

621
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,320
This meal is on me.

622
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,120
By the way, do you know that

623
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,920
you're the first one
that Pai has no problem with?

624
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,280
He also lets me be with you one-on-one.

625
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,440
Really?

626
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,640
Yeah.

627
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,890
I don't usually go out.

628
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,440
Also...

629
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,830
I just wanna be honest with everyone.

630
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,200
Mm...

631
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:41,880
I guess we need to be together more often.

632
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,270
Huh?

633
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,930
You want me to change my faculty?

634
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,170
I have enough.

635
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,960
I'm done.

636
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,170
Let's just dig in.

637
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,230
Hello, sis!

638
00:36:57,270 --> 00:37:03,120
Can I have a cup of iced black coffee?

639
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,600
Make it ice cold, please.

640
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:09,820
Whoa!

641
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,420
It's Nom Jued and...

642
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,330
Who's that?

643
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,920
It's Kornthep!

644
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,120
This is a perfect shot.

645
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,270
That's the shot right there.

646
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,600
Alright.

647
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,880
Oh my... Clean his lips more.

648
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,390
More! More!

649
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,730
I have a scoop on my hands now.

650
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,680
"The Battle of the Two Lions."

651
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,600
Just watch me.

652
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,280
I'm the one stirring the pot.

653
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,570
"Hastily make your way here."

654
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,840
"Nom Jued is with Kornthep at the coffee shop."

655
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,720
"They wipe each other's lips, too."

656
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,260
"Check out the photo I sent you."

657
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,360
[Somchat: Ring, ring! I got a scoop! ]

658
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,170
What?!

659
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,460
Damn.

660
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,100
What the hell is this?

661
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,900
Answer the call, damn it.

662
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,900
Answer the call, you mess!

663
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,570
Damn it!

664
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:15,800
Whoa.

665
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,790
So you started photography
when you were in high school?

666
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,240
Mm, yeah.

667
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,760
It's what I love.

668
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,170
It sounded like
you were saying that to me, though.

669
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,440
Now I know what love actually feels like.

670
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,000
Jued!

671
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,430
You turned your phone off
to avoid paying your debt?

672
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,360
Phra Aek.

673
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,780
- What's going on?
- I didn't do anything.

674
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,040
My phone battery must've died.

675
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,520
Come with me now.

676
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:49,420
But I'm heading home with Korn.

677
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,440
No more words.

678
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,040
Don't forget that you're in debt.

679
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,660
Mm...

680
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,800
Fine. I'm coming with you.

681
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,920
Korn, see you later.

682
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,580
Mm.

683
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,040
Bye-bye!

684
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,360
What's with him?

685
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,960
Phra Aek.

686
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,960
I've repaid you some of the money.

687
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,410
Mm.

688
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,250
I'm starving. Let's dig in.

689
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,490
Huh?

690
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,080
Order your food.

691
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,910
You're just gonna stare at me having my food?

692
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:08,550
Yes.

693
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:13,160
I don't think I can pay for this meal.

694
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,000
Come on. It's not that important.

695
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,380
It is, Phra Aek.

696
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,820
Money is a serious topic.

697
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,300
Be honest. Are you being mean to just me?

698
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,060
I'm not being mean or kind to anyone.

699
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,160
But if you can't pay, this meal is on me.

700
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,360
But how are you gonna pay for this?

701
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,440
Okay, fine.

702
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,480
I'll have the food.

703
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,360
Why are you treating me to a meal, though?

704
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,520
Well...

705
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,830
It's because I can take your hands from Korn.

706
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:58,920
Phra Aek.

707
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,560
Kornthep is a very good person.

708
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,200
Next time, don't do it to him like that.

709
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,600
God.

710
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,060
I know that you have to work with him.

711
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,260
But be careful of him brainwashing you.

712
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,260
Learn to spend time with me.

713
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:15,770
Hey.

714
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:20,010
I know that you got jealous at him

715
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,180
because I got to work with him.

716
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,470
How clever.

717
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,160
Can I order a cup of unsweetened milk then?

718
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,050
Hm?

719
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,250
Ew!

720
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,270
Just order it if you want.

721
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,400
Order some desserts for me, too.

722
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,480
Mm.

723
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,080
All done.

724
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,760
Are you done with your booth?

725
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,240
It's done.

726
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,640
By the way...

727
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,330
Give me a flower bouquet
on exhibition day, okay?

728
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,200
Sure. I'll do as I'm told.

729
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,060
Dig in!

730
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,880
Nom Jued.

731
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,040
Here's a flower bouquet for you, Korn.

732
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,040
Thank you.

733
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,120
Oh, Jan?

734
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,370
I'm here to congratulate you.

735
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,420
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

736
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,840
Have you checked out my booth yet?

737
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,930
Mm, you mean the revealing photos?

738
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,490
They're nude portraits.

739
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:55,960
Right.

740
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,280
Do you like them?

741
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,050
It's really hard to get the lighting just right.

742
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,360
Aren't you embarrassed?

743
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Why do I have to be?

744
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,220
I love my body,

745
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,680
so what's wrong with that?

746
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,200
I don't know.

747
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,080
I'd be embarrassed if I were you.

748
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,260
Anyway, what are you doing here?

749
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,900
Don't you have to stay at your own booth?

750
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:22,720
No.

751
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,440
I enjoy this one more.

752
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:27,180
What makes you think it's beautiful?

753
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,240
I can't tell.

754
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:32,560
It's not about the beauty.

755
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,110
It's about how you interpret it

756
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:36,690
and how it makes you feel.

757
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:39,560
Mm.

758
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,180
I have to take my leave now.

759
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,060
Huh? You're leaving already?

760
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,210
Mm, see you.

761
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,900
I still don't know how I should explain it.

762
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:58,700
Mm...

763
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:03,240
Sometimes,
artists don't even know what they feel.

764
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,620
Mm...

765
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,300
I think it's about hope,

desire,

767
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,330
feelings, and longing.

768
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,960
Still, I'm not sure.
I'm just analyzing it from the color scheme.

769
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,080
That's great.

770
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,520
Keep it going.

What's the matter?

773
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,190
I saw you giving a flower bouquet to Korn.

774
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,990
Huh? It's customary to do that.

775
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:45,980

780
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:05,590
Thanks.

00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,670

00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:36,890
Don't cry, okay?

858
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,580
You say hugging

859
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,770
releases hormones or something, right?

860
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,590
Don't be sad, okay?

861
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:46,950
I don't know what else to do.

862
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:48,970
I'm not crying.

863
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:51,300
I'm just heartbroken.

864
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:59,380
Without my glasses, I can't find my way home.

00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:10,010

866
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,160

Huh?!

868
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,600
You got 20/800 vision?!

869
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,240
Mm.

870
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:20,170
I'll take you home.

871
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,080
Really?

872
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:28,350
Yeah.

873
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:30,990
Thanks.

874
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:32,520
Let's go.

875
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:35,640
Let me take you home.

876
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:40,840
Ow! Jued!

877
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,330
Watch your step!

878
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:45,070
Sorry! I can't see that well.

Let's go.

882
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:06,240
Watch your step.

883
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:08,850
Hey. You're gonna trip.

884
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,280
That was close.

885
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:20,160
I'm sorry, Professor.

886
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:22,670
I lost myself while editing my photos

887
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,210
and touching up all the details.

888
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:26,400
It's alright. I understand that.

889
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:33,030
Why did you include my work in this project?

890
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,650
I thought you were gonna submit Phra Aek's work.

891
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:43,660
Actually, I've decided whose work suits the best.

892
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:48,800
You have to understand that
if I've got more budget,

893
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,600
I'd submit everyone's work for the contest.

894
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:52,890
Right.

895
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:54,750
Thank you so much, Professor.

896
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,040
If there's another project coming up,
please let me know.

897
00:51:58,980 --> 00:51:59,980
Right.

898
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:05,240
I think you should see the world more.

899
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,280
It might inspire you.

900
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,350
Right.

901
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,840
You can leave now if there's nothing else left.

902
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,080
I have to get back to my work now.

903
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,490
- Alright, Professor.
- Mm.

904

905
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,420
Thank you, Phra Aek.

906
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:00,680
Just get inside already.

907
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,280
I really appreciate it.

908
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,320
Would you like to have a drink first?

909
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:07,420
No, I'm heading home now.

910
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:10,690
Nom.

911
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,450
- Hi, Mom.
- Yes?

912
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,200
You're here to get rid of my junk?

913
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:18,160
Huh?!

914
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,200
Uh...

915
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:21,350
This is Phra Aek, a friend of mine.

916
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,560
- Yes.
- Oh...

917
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:27,930
- He's your friend?
- Yes, Mom.

918
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,600
I'm so sorry, dear.

919
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:33,080
I thought it was the garbage collector.

921
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,600
so he volunteered to give me a ride home.

922
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,250
Oh.

923
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,380
Thank you so much, dear.

924
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,040
No problem.

925
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,720
"No problem," you say?

926
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,400
Let's get inside.

927
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:50,360
I've got a ton of snacks on me.

928
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,040
- Let me treat you, okay?
- Okay.

929
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:52,870
Right.

930
00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:55,760
Nom, take him inside, okay?

931
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:56,800
Sure, Mom.

932
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:01,310
Phra Aek.

933
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,360
My mom invited you for a snack.

934
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,640
Would you like to come inside?

935
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:13,100
But don’t tell her that I joined the club

936
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:16,570
and that I'm in your debt.

937
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,680
I don't want her to be worried.

938
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:24,570
Right, right. Find yourself
another pair of glasses first.

939
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:35,640
This way, Nom.

940
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,950
- Come and sit with your friend.
- Yes, Mom.

941
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,310
Won't this pair of glasses make you dizzy?

942
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,120
A little bit.

943
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,940
But this is the only pair I've got.

944
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,080
My eyesight has also gotten worse over time.

945
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,430
How about getting a new pair of glasses?

946
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:57,160
It's okay, Mom. I'll wear this one for now.

947
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:00,860
Oh! I forgot to ask what his name is.

948
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:02,240
What's his name, dear?

949
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:03,670
Uh...

950
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:05,810
My name is Phra Aek.

951
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:10,920
Right.

952
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,720
What a strange name, am I right?

953
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:13,530
Right.

954
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:16,920
You're pretty good looking, actually.

955
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:20,960
If you groom yourself,

956
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,910
it'll be better for you.

957
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:29,150
By the way, are you in the same friend group
with Pomphrab and Satrupai?

958
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:30,940
No, Mom.

959
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,410
He's an art sophomore.

960
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,210
Oh?

961
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,760
I thought you were a science senior.

962
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:42,040
You enjoy drawing, don't you?

963
00:55:42,430 --> 00:55:43,480
No, actually.

964
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,840
I study photography.

965
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:52,010
What do you want to do after graduating?

966
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,840
Working as a photographer, of course.

967
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:56,730
Aww...

968
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,460
That's rough, isn't it?

969
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:01,120
Mom.

970
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,840
I think he's got an urgent business to tend to.

971
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:05,730
How about taking some snacks with you?

972
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:07,990
You've gotta go now.

973
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,160
Have a good evening.

974
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,510
Thank you for taking me home.

975
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:20,710
Mm.

976
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:26,240
Honestly, after graduating from my faculty,

977
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:29,040
I still don't know what I wanna do.

978
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,800
I just follow what my mom wants.

979
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,480
No, I'm not bugged by that.

980
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,100
Still, thank you so much

981
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:39,480
for bearing with that.

982
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:42,510
You're amazing.

983
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:43,600
Yay!

984
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,280
No.

985
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,990
Madam Mommy is kind-hearted herself.

986
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:51,010
It's Mom, not Madam Mommy.

987
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,280
Whatever.

988
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,180
I truly respect her.

989
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:57,530
- By the way, you're not gonna tell your mom...
- Hey!

990
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Stop.

991
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:06,870
This isn't the time.

992
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:08,360
Mom's watching us.

993
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:12,740
Right.

994
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,080
Thank you for taking me home.

995
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,650
You truly are my hero.

996
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,340
A hero that protects you?

997
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,290
Just so you know, it's not for free.

998
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:31,050
Whoa.

999
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,220
How am I gonna pay you then?

1000
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,270
Pay me 100M baht.

1001
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:47,950
He's gone like the wind.

1002
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:11,730
Who the hell are you?!

1003
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:20,680
You two know each other?

1004
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,040
- Yes.
- No!
