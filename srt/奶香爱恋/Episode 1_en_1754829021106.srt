so I suggest you use some bleach.

367
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,180
It'll make you look more put together

375
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,180
I'll get back to my project now.

376

Okay.

What's on your mind?

378
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:27,020
Why do you want to join
this Photography Club?

379
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,120
Right.

380
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,980
The FAA students made this, didn't they?

381
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,220
Those people seem crazy

382
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,550
and a bit out of their mind.

383
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,060
Can you handle that?

384
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,220
I just want to try something new.

385
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,860
I'm a junior now.

00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,110
That's why

387
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:45,060
you need to focus on your future.

388
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,380
You're right.

389
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,940
But honestly,

390
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,780
our course schedule is already packed.

391
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,170
Don't ask for more trouble.

392
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:03,700
Oh!

393
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:08,010
After class, you two can head there before me.

394
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,720
I'll buy some milk

395
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,870
and get the copied sheets for you guys.

396
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,960
We can just go together.

397
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:15,980
Yeah.

398
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,290
It's okay.

399
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,740
You got this for me.

400
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,520
I'll get those for you.

401

Let's go together,

402

403
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,390

409

I don't like that.

410

Gosh, that's not pretty.

Look at that.

No, I don't want it.

Why did you do that?

420
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,060
This was expensive.

421
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,260
I just bought it.

422
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,740

So what's the problem with the little guy?

520
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:56,930
Let him diagnose it first.

521
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:58,430
From the looks of it,

522
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:00,230
I think you should sell it.

523
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,320

No, I'm free.

I won't show them to you anymore.

I don't have a professional camera
like you do.

536
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:02,410
Take out your phone.

537
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,540
It can actually take photos this great?

538
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,030
Mm.

539
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:38,400
It all depends on how you feel
about what's in front of you.

You're treating him like he's a kid.

549
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:05,800
Is there something going on?

550

553
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:11,730
he wouldn't have made it this far.

What bang?

557
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:18,660
What makes you think that?

558
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:20,060
- Yeah.
- I'm kidding.

559
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,410
I'll isolate myself to study soon.

560
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:23,370
For how long?

561
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:24,880
For this exam, it's 45 days.

562
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:26,340
Then who's gonna drink with me?

563
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:28,030
With Nom Jued, of course!

564
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,390
Don't mess with my kid.

565
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,490
He doesn't drink.

566
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,350
By the way...

567
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:37,050
I kinda got beaten this semester.

568
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:39,440
Professors never stop giving us quizzes.

569
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:40,750
It's driving me nuts!

570
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,210
Let's stop talking and drink.

571
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,130
- Cheers!
- Drink up!

572
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:43,880
Here.

573
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,870
[Nom Jued: Pai, see you tomorrow at the gallery;
I don't wanna go there alone]

574
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:03,250
- Sheesh!
- Sheesh!!

575
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,050
Is it Nom Jued again?

576
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:06,020
Did he text you?

577
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,580
Don't tease me.

578
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:26,070
Hey.

579
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:28,350
I'm not a pole.

580
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,160
You are

581
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:32,050
a talking pole.

582
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:38,550
Are you the nude model?

583
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:41,220
I guess so.

584
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:44,130
You look much hotter in person.

585
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:45,920
Obviously.

586
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:48,670
Are you busy tonight?

587
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:50,130
What are you doing?

588
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,330
If you wanna do that,
then come at me.

589
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:54,060
Hey, I wasn't doing anything.

590
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:55,760
Bullshit.

591
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,390
Don't mess with my friend.

592
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:58,870
You're not single, remember?

593
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:00,520
Let's go.

594
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:02,640
Watch your step.

595
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:09,890
- Sorry.
- Sorry...

596
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:29,410
What happened?

597
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,850
Aww...

598
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:33,320
I think I've found my love.

599
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:34,290
Love?

600
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,250
What do you mean?

601
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:40,960
Wait...

602
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:42,490
Where's Best?

603
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:43,960
Probably smoking.

604
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,130
It's already been a while now,

605
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:46,070
you should go and look for him.

606
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:50,490
Alright, alright. I'll do it.

607
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:07,270
Excuse me.

608
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,570
Take them to Phutthamonthon.

609
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:12,490
See you, man.

610
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:13,410
See you.

611
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:40,830
Mister?

612
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:42,540
Hey.

613
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,250
Are you good?

614
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:50,130
Please get up.

615
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,080
Come on, Pai.

616
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,560
[Nom Jued: Pai? You're ditching me? No!]

617
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,200
[Nom Jued: I thought we'd be at
the gallery together! I'm heartbroken]

618
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,560
What? You secretly took photos of me again?

619
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,080
I did nothing.

620
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,860
I don't think so.

621
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,550
If I catch you using photos of me
for something again,

622
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,800
I'm calling the police.

623
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,870
Gosh, just stop that.

624
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,000
Why are you still waiting out here?

625
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,450
Phra Aek...

626
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,320
"Closed for maintenance."

627
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,880
[Closed for maintenance]

628
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,720
What?!

629
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,460
Why today?

630
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,640
Man...

631
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,010
Anyway,

632
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,290
do you have other shooting locations in mind?

633
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,070
Um...

634
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,180
There's one.

635
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,960
What are you shooting?

636
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,700
You, obviously.

637
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,860
Let me see.

638
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,060
Here.

639
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,010
It's ugly.

640
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,570
You're texting your partner?

641
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,500
Nope.

642
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,200
It's my new friend at another college.

643
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,890
A new one?

644
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,830
She's a girl?

645
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:36,920
Yup.

646
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,410
I feel more comfortable talking to girls,

647
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,510
unlike boys.

648
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,840
All they want is...

649
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,440
Let's not talk about it.

650
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,380
What do you think of her?

651
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,710
Is she nice?

652
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,660
Kinda.

653
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:56,560
She's got a sweet vibe.

654
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,960
I think I'm gonna ask her out.

655
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,620
No.

656
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,250
I'm not letting you go.

657
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,930
You need to help me with my work first.

658
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,340
Don't be so sneaky.

659
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,640
Fine.

660
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,180
- Hey.
- Hm?

661
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,160
Is it overexposed?

662
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,180
Where?

663
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,640
Come on, this is a product shoot.

664
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,800
Stop with shooting in moody tones.

665
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,800
Shoot it nice and bright.

666
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,090
By the way...

667
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,850
Don't you wanna date someone?

668
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,630
Or...

669
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,850
You're hiding the truth from me?

670
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:45,790
Huh?

671
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,930
How could I

672
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,240
if we're always this close?

673
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,220
If I were taken,
I would've already disappeared by now.

674
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,500
Okay, okay.

675
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,140
Back to work.

676
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,670
Sure thing.

677
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,500
Working...

678
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,159
Seriously?

679
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,130
Isn't black coffee bitter?

680
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:17,920
It's none of your business.

681
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,040
Huh.

682
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,080
I'm just curious.

683
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,929
Let me try yours.

684
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,360
God!

685
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,810
It's so freaking sweet!

686
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,639
How can you still drink that?

687
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,560
Well...

688
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,040
A milk drink is always sweet, no?

689
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:48,949
And...

690
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:51,320
You sure this is the shooting location?

691
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,150
Mm.

692
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,880
This place is my absolute favorite.

693
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,739
Favorite?

694
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,060
What's to like about it?

695
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,440
Well...

696
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,840
There.

697
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,570
It's that teddy bear.

698
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,080
It's so adorable, Phra Aek.

699
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,610
It's enormous.

700
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:21,350
I bet the logo has a bear
because of that huge teddy bear.

701
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,640
Yeah, I quit.

702
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,770
Hey, man!

703
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,360
Dude! Hey!

704
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,280
I'm fucking done.

705
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,290
You can't do this to me!

706
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,570
Hey!

707
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,650
Fine! Just get out of here!

708
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,170
It's over between you and me.

709
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,770
Out!

710
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,640
And he's actually leaving...

711
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,610
It's over!

712
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,360
I'm all alone now!

713
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,520
What should we do?

714
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,480
I think...

715
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:02,650
We should shoot at a different cafe.

716
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,400
I think so.

717
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,730
Let's go.

718
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,610
The outfit!

719
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,000
That belongs to the cafe, dude!

720
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,840
Who else is gonna help me now?

721
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,300
You guys are leaving as well?

722
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,520
All gone...

723
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,340
I'm all alone now.

724
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,590
Whoa! Look!

725
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,150
I'm taller than you!

726
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,810
It's because you're ahead of me.

727
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,260
You're making that
stupid tone of voice again, Nom Nom.

728
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,130
It's Nom Jued.

729
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,510
It's not Nom Nom.

730
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,760
Why?

731
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,040
I hate the name Nom Jued
because it sounds as bland as milk.

732
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,930
I also hate the milk drink you're drinking.

733
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,370
It's absurdly sweet.

734
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,630
It's tasty, though.

735
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,100
You're a freshman studying science, right?

736
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,560
No, I'm in my junior year now.

737
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:14,790
Huh?

738
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,880
You're a junior?

739
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,580
Mm.

740
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,190
I'm a junior.

741
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,640
You're a senior, right?

742
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,840
I already knew that.

743
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,040
A senior?

744
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,240
I'm a sophomore.

745
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,080
Why don't you look like one, though?

746
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,480
The same goes for you.

747
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,400
Huh? Then why don't you use polite language
if you're younger than me?

748
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,680
If it's you, I can't bring myself to do it.

749
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,030
Hey! What did you shoot?

750
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,840
- Let me see them!
- They're not photos of you!

751
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:00,000
Did you shoot my acne
or something with all that burst?

752
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,920
They're unusable either way.

753
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,220
And you told me
you're gonna teach me photography.

754
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,310
Yes, I'm about to.

755
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,120
Just go over there.

756
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,250
Hey, we can try taking some shots here.

757
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,410
Here. See?

758
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:28,760
This value is for the f-stop,
known as the aperture.

759
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,240
Notice that it's got both
positive and negative values here.

760
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,200
Here.

761
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,790
Thanks, Phra Aek.

762
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,210
Although you seemed scary at first,

763
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,320
you're actually such a gentle soul.

764
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,030
Whatever.

765
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,810
Do you know what you wanna shoot now?

766
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I'll shoot it for you.

767
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,780
Mm...

768
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,200
No.

769
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,710
I wanna do it myself.

770
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,280
Please?

771
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,690
Please...

772
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,230
No, you're gonna drop my camera.

773
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,490
Here.

774
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,860
I'm worried I might drop it, too.

775
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,120
I'm kidding.

776
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,640
Just take a shot.

777
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,680
Well then, I'm going all out now.

778
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,680
Yeah, take beautiful photos, okay?

779
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,000
By the way, what is your subject?

780
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,680
Mm...

781
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,110
I guess you can be my subject!

782
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:30,840
Huh?

783
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,890
What? No!

784
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,200
- Why me?
- Phra Aek!

785
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,800
Please let me do what I wanna do.

786
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,080
Just shoot something else.

787
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,500
A good photographer is a good model, too.

788
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:39,400
- No, shoot something else.
- Please, Phra Aek.

789
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,880
- No! Stop!
- You taught me, so I wanna give it a shot.

790
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,920
- Hey!
- Whoa!

791
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,170
Watch it!

792
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,280
Are you hurt?

793
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,120
I'm sorry!

794
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,700
You don't have to say that.

795
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,180
You didn't do anything wrong.

796
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,000
That bastard did.

797
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,070
He's riding that bike without his brain.

798
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:01,680
You're okay, right?

799
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:05,820
I mean...

800
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:09,010
I'm sorry for dropping the camera.

801
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,490
Hey!

802
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
You mess!

803
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,400
I told you to hold it carefully.

804
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,600
I think you better buy a new one.

805
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,280
Please, say something, Phra Aek

806
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,970
Will saying something fix my camera?

807
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,270
Hey!

808
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,580
What the hell are you doing?

809
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,920
You're scaring me.

810
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,760
In science, it says that

811
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,980
physical contact stimulates oxytocin,

812
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,490
which causes the body to produce endorphins.

813
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,700
Should we get a part-time job at a cafe?

814
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:07,820
- What?
- What?

815
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:09,090
You broke the camera?

816
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:12,040
The camera for taking photos?

817
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:15,110
I think we should go to a different one.

818
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,330
This place doesn't look good.

819
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,470
- Shit!
- Oh!

820
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,560
A ghost?

821
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,840
Are you hiring?

822
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,200
Yes, I am.

823
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,760
- I would like to apply!
- So do I!

824
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,700
Don't get my hopes up.

825
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,600
I'm not!

826
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,160
I'll show you.

827
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,410
Your photo...

828
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,200
What kind of camera did you use to take it?

829
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,000
I took it on a phone.

830
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:49,390
Oh, I see.

831
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,040
I thought...

832
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,830
you shot it on an iron!

833
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,440
If you're that good,
then make it yourself.

834
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,200
If you can manage it, enjoy it.

835
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,860
If not, dump it.

836
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,040
I won't pay for this.

837
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,760
The coffee sucks,

838
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,720
and I've told you several times
about your staff.

839
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,560
I'm not paying.

840
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,400
- Pai! Easy.
- You wanna fight?

841
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,270
It's okay. Calm down.

842
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,160
Jued!

843
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,600
If you visit my place,

844
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,440
I will...
