I don't think that matters.

132
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,120
And...

133
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,410
What have you done to your face, Shorty?

134
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,440
I've been using my go-to
Star Lab PRO SKIN facial cream.

135
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,160
It's great. It deeply nourishes the skin.

Had I not stopped you,

143
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,280
you would've already kissed him.

144
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,860
Calm down, Phrab.

145
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,280
Phra Aek probably didn't have that idea.

146
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,770

148
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,000
he still has the same habits as always.

149
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,640

Come and revise
the assignment with me first.

- Mm!

170

- We can do that later.
- Hurry!

171
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,800
- Wait! No!
- Come on!

You, of course.

176

Mm...

After taking your glasses off,
and with your new hairstyle,

179

you look more handsome.

180

Mm.

182

I'm gonna take care of you today,

184
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,000
as there are a bunch of creeps
walking around here.

185
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,480
I need to use the bathroom.

186
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,560
Sure.

187
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:47,910
Meet me here after class, okay?

188
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,810
What's with the hurry, man?

189
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,400
Get inside!

190
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,600
Don't...

191
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,640
Just get inside.

192
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,720
Let me go!

193
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,480
What are you trying to do, Phra Aek?
That really hurt!

194
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,030
- What's going on? I need to go to my class.
- Hey.

195
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,900
Why are you covering my face with a bag?

196
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,450
Just keep it on.

197
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,870
You think this is funny?

198
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,820
I'll cut down on the debt.

199
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,760
No.

200
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,910
If this is what it takes,
I'm not doing it.

201
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:35,180
You're bullying me way too much.

202
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,120
Yeah, right.

203
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,640
You're heading to your faculty, right?

204
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,880
It's about to rain, you know?

205
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,920
You're gonna get soaked.

206
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,740
Huh? It's gonna rain?

207
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,440
Yes, it is.

208
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,760
Right...

209
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,850
Thank you, Phra Aek.

210
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,280
I'm off to my class then.

211
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,390
Right. Watch your step, okay?

212
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,100
- Mm.
- Don't take it off, okay?

213
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,100
This should protect me from the rain, right?

214
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,160
Hi, Pai.

215
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,360
What are you doing?

216
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,970
It's a good thing that it didn't rain.

217
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,640
I hastily made my way to the class, too.

218
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,280
What rain?

219
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,480
Phra Aek told me that it was gonna rain.

220
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,230
That's why he got me this plastic bag.

221
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,050
He was probably worried I'd get soaked.

222
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
What's he trying to do now?

223
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,950
And where are your glasses?

224
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,460
Don't tell me that
Phra Aek took them from you.

225
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,640
I've already told you

226
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,290
that they were broken.

227
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,880
I texted Phrab,

228
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,030
and he said he had no pair to spare for me.

229
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,240
That's why I'm wearing contact lenses.

230
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,300
I can piece it together now.

231
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:11,940
About what?

232
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,180
It's nothing.

233
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:18,080
Just stay away from Phra Aek.

234
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,680
[Let's meet at the same bar tonight
to celebrate the new club members]

235
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,720
"Promise me that you will not drink, smoke,

236
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,670
and be with bad guys."

237
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,710
Okay, students.

238
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,450
Welcome to the Photography class.

239
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:50,200
In today's class, we'll be learning
about color schemes and composition.

240
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,320
[Oh, wow! So cute!]

241
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,520
Damn it!

242
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,790
Hey.

243
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,110
What the hell is wrong with you?

244
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,400
God...

245
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,000
What faculty is that guy studying at?

246
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,830
Huh?

247
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:10,550
If you're curious,
just visit his profile page.

248
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:14,440
I think he's an IT student.

249
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,540
You think?

250
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,250
Why do you wanna know?

251
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,420
He commented on a post about Nom Jued,

252
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,120
saying "So cute,"

253
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,650
"I love you. Can I date you?"

254
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,130
"Are you single?"

255
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,140
Look at him.

256
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,040
Oh, really?

257
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,140
Are you that possessive of him?

258
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,870
You're his father or something?

259
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,320
I'm not his father.

260
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,240
I'm his...

261
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,120
His boyfriend?

262
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:48,230
Ow!

263
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,280
Shush!

264
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,270
Oh, my...

265
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,640
Love really changes people, doesn't it?

266
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,080
You skip classes

267
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,070
just so you can see that lovely face of his.

268
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,030
God, what a mess.

269
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,120
I'm such a good example.

270
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,360
Pai, Pai.

271
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,520
Look.

272
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,440
A photo of me
is on the faculty's Facebook page.

273
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,050
Let me see.

274
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,770
What?

275
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,880
Who posted it?

276
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,460
Yeah.

277
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,480
Who took the photo?

278
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,220
It's of high quality, too.

279
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,440
I'm so confused.

280
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,880
What does the caption say?

281
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,950
"Spotted a cutie

282
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,910
with a cool fashion sense."

283
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,040
Whoa!

284
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,810
It's got so many likes and comments, too.

285
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,440
Let me see.

286
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,160
What do people think about it?

287
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,600
For the most part, they're compliments, actually.

288
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:51,050
However, there are some creepy ones.

289
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,370
Pai.

290
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,120
I'm scared.

291
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,920
Will they do something to me?

292
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,700
What's to be scared of?

293
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,310
Keep your chest up!

294
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,079
Chest up!

295
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,599
- Yeah.
- Keep my chest up?

296
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,640
We're the handsome boys.

297
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,339
Here.

298
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,160
Why are people still staring at me, Pai?

299
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,060
Just ignore them.

300
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,480
I'm happy that I've got a handsome friend.

301
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,000
Huh? Who?

302
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,960
Whatever.

303
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,930
Dig in.

304
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,110
Mm.

305
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,480
The food here is great.

306
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,040
Hmm...

307
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,830
- Am I the handsome one?
- God, this is driving me insane.

308
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,640
Move.

309
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,420
- You're late.
- Oh, Phrab.

310
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,180
My professor called it a day so late.

311
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,620
I shouldn't have enrolled in weird subjects.

312
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,120
I should've stuck with you guys.

313
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,510
See? I told you.

314
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,200
You didn't believe me.

315
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:29,670
Hey.

316
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,460
Hi, Phra Aek.

317
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,970
Why did you take the bag off?

318
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,520
Well, it's not raining.

319
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,360
It is.

320
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,430
The forecast said it's gonna rain.

321
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,920
Hey, bastard.

322
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,760
My name is Phra Aek.

323
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,680
Hey, Phra Ass.

324
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,990
What part of your brain makes you think that

325
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,350
you can screw around with my friend?

326
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:48,880
Huh?

327
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,700
What's with the bag nonsense?

328
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,730
Nobody would do such a thing.

329
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,390
It's a common thing in my neighborhood.

330
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,510
Piss off.

331
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,500
Just look at him.

332
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,080
What?

333
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,700
I don't know how Madam Mommy
let him go out and about by himself.

334
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,880
Hey, hey!

335
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,140
What do you have to do with him?

336
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,240
I'm the one convincing his mom
to let him the contact lenses.

337
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,700
Why are you being so nosy, huh?

338
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,650
You didn't take care of your friends at all.

339
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,040
We didn't, huh?

340
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,160
Uh... How about we all just calm down?

341
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,760
Please calm down, Brothers.

342
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,830
We always take care of him, Buddy.

343
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,450
You said we didn't, huh?

344
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,330
We never let pesky bastards lay eyes on him,

345
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,840
and you're the first to leave.

346
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,360
- Me?
- Yeah.

347
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,250
Me?

348
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,430
Then, look at this.

349
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:43,600
Look at what this comment says.

350
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,720
Look at it!

351
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,520
Okay, now I've seen it.

352
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,960
This is pissing me off.

353
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,370
Should we get him?

354
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,260
Yeah, let's do it.

355
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,630
You've got the stuff, right?

356
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,440
Yes.

357
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,850
Grab whatever you can.

358
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,050
Brothers,

359
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,800
let's calm down.

360
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,880
Let's make him pay.

361
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,040
Uh...

362
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,490
You have to thank me

363
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,410
for taking care of him this well, though.

364
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,800
Thank my ass.

365
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,760
Ouch!

366
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,640
You're getting carried away, aren't you?

367
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,320
And you said you were gonna join me.

368
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,590
Who said we'd do that?

369
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,190
Come on.

370
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,720
How upsetting.

371
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,040
Hey.

372
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:32,880
Hm?

373
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,330
Why does it have to be like this?

374
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,560
Everything's been fine,

375
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,680
except for one thing.

376
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,760
She's a nude model

377
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,200
Why?

378
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,230
You're not okay with that?

379
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,000
Would you be fine with

380
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,300
seeing people staring at nude photos
of your lover in public?

381
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,160
I just can't.

382
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,670
You're still not her lover, though.

383
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,680
Aww, I know.

384
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,120
She's my future lover.

385
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,840
You're going off the rails,

386
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,760
making no sense.

387
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,240
Think about it.

388
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,960
Be honest.

389
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,870
Are you happy being with her?

390
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,480
Mm...

391
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,450
Yeah.

392
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:39,450
Well...

393
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,470
It'd really make me happy

394
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,530
if you were to enjoy this cup.

395
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,420
I didn't order this.

396
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,880
I told you to enjoy it.

397
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,630
Leave a review, too.

398
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:13,770
This course of action violates Section 309.

399
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,360
Extortion against someone

400
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,890
to compel them to do their bidding

401
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,360
or obligate them

402
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,570
to act under hostility,

403
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,490
jeopardizing their livelihood,

404
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,900
will, freedom,

405
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,440
fame, or assets

406
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,970
shall be punished with at least
three years of imprisonment

407
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,170
and a fine of up to 60,000 baht,

408
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,780
or both imprisonment and a fine.

409
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,720
What about the comment
about the taste of the drink?

410
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,460
Do you think that's fair?

411
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,370
- Huh?
- What comment?

412
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,760
Here.

413
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:23,850
Don't customers have the right
to voice their opinions?

414
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,440
It's fine if it's just that.

415
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,280
But you had over a thousand people
review-bombing this place

416
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,400
What's the deal with that?

417
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:33,860
Huh?

418
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,680
I don't know what your thoughts are on this,

419
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,490
but as a regular customer,

420
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,520
I still enjoy this place.

421
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,860
However, I'm now beginning to be unsure

422
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,950
if that is still the case.

423
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,780
I'm also not sure
if I'd like to study my notes here.

424
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,040
Who cares if you don't come here?

425
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,800
We don't want a bad customer
like you here anyway.

426
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,960
Let's leave, Jan.

427
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,000
Yeah, get out!

428
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,670
Don't you ever come back here.

429
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,170
Do whatever you want

430
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,830
and don't delete
whatever you've posted, too.

431
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,290
Just make this place crash and burn.

432
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,200
Oh, hi, Nom Jued.

433
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,470
You're here as well?

434
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,240
Mm.

435
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:10,280
But I'm debating
whether or not I should go in.

436
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,170
Let's go inside and have fun!

437
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,820
I've never had a drink,

438
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,780
and I'm hesitant to do so.

439
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,140
Hey.

440
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,880
I've never had a drink either.

441
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,540
I wanna try, though.

442
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,740
Nobody would force us to drink,

443
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,640
right?

444
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,560
Mm. Maybe.

445
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,230
Let's get inside.

446
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,200
Let's go.

447
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,040
Hey! I said no!

448
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,080
Don't be shy.

449
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,360
- Come here!
- Hey!

450
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,310
Chat! Hey!

451
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,730
Hello, everyone.

452
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:52,190
Let's make some noise for Phra Aek!

453
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,920
Why are you putting me on the spot like this?

454
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,050
Come on!
Everyone is eager to make noises for you!

455
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,040
Listen.

456
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,720
They wanna see what the top dog
of the sophomores is like.

457
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,230
Isn't that right, guys?!

458
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,370
See?

459
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,680
Who would like to hear Phra Aek sing?

460
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,900
Yeah!

461
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:12,920
See? They're all excited.

462
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,930
Come on.

463
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:44,280
â™«Feeling starstruck, my eyes wide openâ™«

464
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:49,900
â™«You look better than before, babyâ™«

465
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:56,550
â™«From ordinary,
it all becomes so extraordinary,â™«

466
00:26:56,590 --> 00:27:01,230
â™«As you and I are making historyâ™«

467
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:06,820
â™«What if things have completely changed,â™«

468
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:10,000
â™«And what if it's beyond what we've expected?â™«

469
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,440
[Phra Rong Review: What happened to Nom Mhee Cafe?
The drinks taste worse, and the service is poor]

470
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,070
â™«I don't care what's going to happen nextâ™«

471
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:23,950
â™«I've got to tell you what I want to expressâ™«

472
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:29,360
â™«I want you to listen to
what my heart wants to sayâ™«

473
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:33,980
â™«And what it can give you, babyâ™«

474
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,850
â™«With you and I, we'll become whole,â™«

475
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:39,540
â™«Keeping my heart from the coldâ™«

476
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:42,850
â™«That's all I'd like to ask youâ™«

477
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:47,210
â™«You're the best thing I've ever wished forâ™«

478
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,110
Youâ€™re already this drunk?

479
00:27:59,080 --> 00:27:59,950
Yeah.

480
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,550
Nobody likes a drunk person.

481
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,760
I do, though.

482
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,240
You're ridiculous.

483
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,290
You're drunk as a skunk, you know?

484
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Are you good?

485
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,640
Thank you

486
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,550
for staying by my side.

487
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,370
Mm.

488
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,850
I'm also happy that you're with me.

489
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,490
Let's head home.

490
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,960
We've gotta go now.

491
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,270
Text me how much we've gotta pay, okay?

492
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,440
Let's go, Beauty.

493
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,080
You good?

494
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,080
Are you messing with me?

495
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,170
I'm sorry, Pued.

496
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,120
If I've done anything that upsets you,

497
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,390
just say it to my face.

498
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,090
I don't wanna keep it in my chest anymore.

499
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,670
You're a cheater,

500
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,930
and there's nothing I can do about it.

501
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,290
What cheater?

502
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,300
Just look at you.

503
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,040
You wanna take photos,

504
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,680
but you've got no skills.

505
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,380
Yet, you got to work with Korn,
the President of the Club.

506
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,000
You were close to Phra Aek
way before you joined the club, right?

507
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:02,160
Just admit that you asked him to
take photos for you.

508
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,410
Thereâ€™s no way
you actually know photography.

509
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,880
I don't even know if I do it myself.

510
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:11,950
However...

511
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,400
I took all of the photos myself.

512
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,720
Liar.

513
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,080
It's unfair regardless.

514
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,000
You're not passionate about anything,

515
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,720
but you got accepted anyway.

516
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,730
Meanwhile, my friend,
who is both talented and passionate,

517
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,120
got rejected.

518
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,310
It's because of cheaters like you!

519
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,880
It's so unfair!

520
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,500
I have no clue about what you said.

521
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,770
If I made you upset in any way,

522
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,630
I'm truly sorry.

523
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,760
But I do really put a lot of work into them.

524
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,020
You do?

525
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,720
Jued!

526
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,720
- Hey!
- Pued.

527
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,350
Korn.

528
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,160
I'll take care of him from here.

529
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,080
Let's go, Nom Jued.

530
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,410
Here.

531
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:44,920
Have a drink first.

532
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,580
Are you good?

533
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,400
Kinda.

534
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:08,910
Phra Aek.

535
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,860
My phone battery's dying.

536
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,280
Oh.

537
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:17,950
Here.

538
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:24,810
There.

539
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,120
It's yours.

540
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,310
Why did you give it to me?

541
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:32,880
Well...

542
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:38,120
What would I do if you pretended
that your phone died and ditched me?

543
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:42,880
Phra Aek!

544
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,960
I fucking swear that I won't ditch you!

545
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,870
Why are you this bossy, huh?!

546
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,710
Is there something blocking your ears?

547
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:49,990
Hey...

548
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,990
You're being harsh on me now?

549
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:58,600
I'm sorry.

550
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,280
I often hear you use this tone of voice.

551
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,930
I just wanna try and see what it's like.

552
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,670
Oh, you!

553
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:07,920
Here.

554
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,000
Put your stuff here.

555
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,400
Before hitting the road,

556
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,530
safety first, okay?

557
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,580
Huh?

558
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,840
Ready?

559
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,640
All good.

560
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,480
Alright. Let's head home.

561
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,889
Hey.

562
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,480
Get inside the house already.

563
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:28,239
My face is still very warm.

564
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:33,040
Can I have a rest for a minute first?

565
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,250
My mom would spank me
if she saw me like this.

566
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,139
Sure, have a seat.

567
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,900
Let me see.

568
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,080
Touch it.

569
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,930
Why does Pued hate me so much?

570
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,740
I'm not like what he said at all.

571
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:37,050
Maybe I shouldn't have joined
the club in the first place.

572
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:40,070
I should've joined the science club
like what my mom wanted

573
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,100
and followed my dad's career path.

574
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:47,960
Calm down, Nom.

575
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,900
You didn't do anything to him first, right?

576
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,380
Well, I think I didn't.

577
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,080
Oh!

578
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,180
Maybe it was when I bumped into him,
dropping his work?

579
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,720
It was when I went to the library.

580
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,120
What work?

581
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:17,270
It was something attached to a laptop.

582
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,330
I think it's called an eternal drive
or something.

583
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,960
God...

584
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,690
That's why he's mad at you.

585
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,360
Really?

586
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,520
I even apologized to him, though.

587
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,900
I didn't mean to do any of that.

588
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,040
Maybe he didn't like you in the first place.

589
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,940
I'll...

590
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,920
I'll deal with him.

591
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:58,080
Why do people like to judge others

592
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,200
and label them,

593
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,500
despite not knowing anything about them?

594
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,020
That's what they think.

595
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,280
We can't stop it.

596
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,160
You're right.

597
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:30,560
If people don't know something inside out,

598
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,880
they won't be able to see
other aspects of it clearly.

599
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,130
What the hell are you saying?

600
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,730
That's what my professor taught me.

601
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,740
However, you're different, Phra Aek,

602
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,480
and that makes me happy.

603
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,120
Wait, are you...

604
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,060
Are you actually that type of person, too?

605
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,040
I don't know.

606
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:02,790
I can't answer that.

607
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:10,960
I do believe that you're different, though.

608
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,440
It's just that you bark a lot.

609
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,480
Hey!

610
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,410
Who taught you to say things like that?

611
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,600
It's Satrupai.

612
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,010
Don't be mad at me, okay?

613
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:41,240
If it wasn't you who saved me,

614
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,700
it could've been much worse for me.

615
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,690
Thank you very much,

616
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,790
Phra Aek, the kind.

617
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:54,190
Right.

618
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,950
Just tell me when you need help.

619
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
And...

620
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,270
I'll reimburse you as soon as I can, okay?

621
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,110
Even if you manage that,

622
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:15,750
I'll still help you anyway.

623
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,570
Thanks for letting me hug you.

624
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:35,370
Just tell me if you need it.

625
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,700
I'm always up for a hug.

626
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,440
Oh!

627
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,700
My face is no longer too warm.

628
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,320
I'll...

629
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,240
I'll head inside now, okay?

630
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,200
Right. Just hurry up already.

631
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,520
Have a safe ride home, okay?

632
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,360
Mm! Get inside.

633
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,440
Bye-bye.

634
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,200
Why is my face suddenly so warm?

635
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,520
What's wrong with me?

636
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,000
Hey! Phra Aek!

637
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:41,720
I'm sorry! I didn't mean it!

638
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,240
Don't be so pretentious.

639
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,080
You broke Nom Jued's glasses, right?

640
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:47,210
Pued! You!

641
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,720
Ah!

642
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:57,760
Another interaction caused by
the magnetic movement of the two particles

643
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,040
is similar to that of
two magnets facing each other.

644
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,800
Hey, Nom.

645
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,530
It's Pai, isn't it?

646
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:07,800
Huh?

647
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,310
What's going on?

648
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,700
Look at him.

649
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,520
He's in hot water again.

650
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,360
Whoa...

651
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:21,820
The background music for the video
also really emphasizes the message.

652
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,620
He can't keep going around messing
with people like this.

653
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,460
They might think he's a thug,

654
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:31,440
not a student.

655
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,610
What makes you think that he always does it?

656
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,820
It's possible that he did

657
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,270
because he wanna prove that

658
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,150
the drink that he made tasted good.

659
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,560
God...

660
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,380
You're so optimistic.

661
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,110
Of all the people?

662
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,680
Still...

663
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,990
He's not someone
who'd mess with others first.

664
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,710
But just look at the video.

665
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:09,760
People would still think that he started it.

666
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,140
Took you long enough.

667
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,170
I got up late.

668
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,680
Nom.

669
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,470
What is it, Pai?

670
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:02,480
Just take it.

671
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:05,270
This is as much as I can do.

672
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,790
What happened?

673
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,120
Let's put this behind us.

674
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:32,900
I think you should find a job
that suits you better.

675
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,490
- But...
- Hey!

676
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,380
No more words.

677
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,680
I don't wanna hear anything from you.

678
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,320
Whose wallet is this?

679
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,720
Right...

680
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,960
So you're a law student.

681
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,470
You're gonna have a piece of me.

682
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,280
Yeah.

683
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,950
If I see his face,

684
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,570
I'm gonna teach him a lesson.

685
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,010
I've got nothing to lose anyway.

686
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:33,480
Since electrons and protons
are particles in which...

687
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:36,330
- What's with him?
- Who the hell is he?

688
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:39,840
Brother.

689
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,230
I'm sorry for upsetting you.

690
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,340
I...

691
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:45,900
I spiked your drink.

692
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,760
I've learned my lesson!

693
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:48,900
It's okay, Pued.

694
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,700
What happened to you, though?

695
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:54,600
I beg you.

696
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,070
I no longer have anything
against you, actually.

697
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,480
Really?

698
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:00,890
Thank you very much.

699
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,150
And...

700
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,760
Who did this to you?

701
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:14,100
- Was it Phra Aek?
- Ah!

702
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,100
Phra Aek?!

703
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:18,460
Phra Aek!

704
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,480
Seriously?

705
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,560
Is there really a sane art student?

706
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,560
There's one.

707
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,720
- Who?
- His name is Korn.

708
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:35,760
I've heard that there's something going on
between you and him,

709
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:36,680
Nom Jued.

710
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:39,960
Is there?

711
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,240
- Sheesh!
- Oh, he's flustered as well.

712
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,560
No!

713
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,540
There's nothing going on.

714
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:50,520
Really?

715
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:51,720
Let's leave.

716
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,250
Who just texted me?

717
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,360
[Kornthep: For the Photography Club's
new project,]

718
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,600
[Kornthep: please drop by the club
today or tomorrow

719
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:04,840
to pick up your assignment]

720
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,210
"Please," he says?

721
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:13,560
Take that.

722
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,870
Wait, you're not done?

723
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,110
Almost.

724
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:28,140
Don't tell me that
you're throwing all of these away.

725
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:29,980
We can at least sell them, no?

726
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,360
Who's gonna buy them?

727
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:37,380
If that's the case, can I have one for myself?

728
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:42,060
Go ahead.

729
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,960
By the way,

730
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:50,810
you haven't told me what each photo means.

731
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,630
Mm...

732
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,460
I don't know it either.

733
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,800
You have to interpret them yourself.

734
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:02,560
I just used my feelings.

735
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:03,880
You knew that, didn't you?

736
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,620
Even the professor didn't understand.

737
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,130
Really?

738
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:10,430
I did, actually.

739
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,920
It's like each photo can actually draw me into it.

740
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,360
You're kidding me.

741
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,240
It's true. I'm not joking.

742
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:23,380
Into the pile.

743
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,210
Go back to your class!

744
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:27,870
Honestly,

745
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,280
they look way better than my nude photos.

746
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,230
So you're gonna pivot to my style?

747
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:34,770
Nope.

748
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,510
I'm fine with doing nude photos.

749
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,460
But I'll take a step further.

750
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:43,540
All into the pile.

751
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:51,640
Well...

752
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,880
Let me keep one.

753
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:55,760
Mm.

754
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,410
Take as many as you'd like.

755
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,270
The pile is mine, then.

756
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:02,850
I'm gonna sell them.

757
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,200
Share the profit with me, too.
I'm the photographer here.

758
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:07,820
No promises.

759
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,280
I've gotta go now.

760
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,400
See you.

761
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,270
- Wanna drink?
- Yeah, let's go.

762
00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:33,000
It's been so long. I'm thirsty.

763
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:33,760
Let's go.

764
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,530
Hey. Is that Pai?

765
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:36,840
Yeah, it's him.

766
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Hey, Pai!

767
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:41,480
Oh, hi. What's up, Nine and Ten?

768
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,320
What are you doing at my college?

769
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,290
- Yeah.
- You're looking for a girl or something?

770
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:46,820
Look at you.

771
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,560
You've been drinking hard or what?

772
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,560
What drinking?

773
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,510
I both work and study.

774
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:54,720
It's so hard.

775
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,480
What do you do, though?

776
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,200
It's best you don't know it.

777
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:01,280
I quit the job.

778
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,270
Anyway, we just finished our exam.

779
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:05,100
Are you free to drink tonight?

780
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:06,880
Let's go!

781
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,680
It's been so long.

782
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:10,840
I'm so thirsty.

783
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:13,640
By the way, where are you guys going?

784
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:14,640
To a mall.

785
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:15,480
Wanna join us?

786
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,290
Sure!

787
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,120
Look at you.

788
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,670
You're way too agreeable;
I bet you're heartbroken!

789
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:24,520
Heartbroken my ass.

790
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,100
- I bet he is.
- You're heartbroken.

791
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:27,830
- It's because you are!
- I bet!

792
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:34,660
Hey, I'm so sorry.

793
00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:38,280
Took you forever.

794
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:39,730
We're supposed to meet here at 9 P.M.,

795
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:41,120
but you got here at 10.30 P.M.?

796
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:44,100
The traffic at the college was insane.

797
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:46,440
Serve yourself a drink.

798
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,280
Right.

799
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,280
Where's Nine?

800
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,720
He's waiting for
his Greek life member outside.

801
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,720
He wants to bring them here.

802
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,790
His Greek life member is coming as well?

803
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:16,990
Yeah.

804
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,030
Is she pretty?

805
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:21,760
It's a guy.

806
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:24,900
Damn it.

807
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,470
You guys don't have a sorority member at all?

808
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,080
No, it's a curse among our friend group.

809
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:36,000
Sorry, Iâ€™m here now.

810
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,240
Speaking of the devil...

811
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,520
You're clinking your glasses without me?

812
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,370
- Here!
- Cheers!

813
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:45,220
Oh.

814
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,200
Where is your Greek life member?

815
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:48,240
He's on his way.

816
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:49,960
Here he is.

817
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:52,780
Hello.

818
00:51:00,270 --> 00:51:01,270
Right, right.

819
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,560
This is Ten.

820
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:03,800
But I think you already knew that.

821
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,150
That's Pai.

822
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,580
He's from a different college.

823
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,770
This is one of my Greek life members.
His name is Phra Rong.

824
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,640
So we meet again.

825
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,480
You two know each other?

826
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:19,660
- Yes.
- No!

827
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:28,400
We've seen each other at cafes.

828
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:29,760
We've only seen each other.

829
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,400
So do you know him?

830
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:33,720
I don't.

831
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:38,160
No worries.

832
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,330
Even though, right now, he doesn't,

833
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:45,600
I'm sure we'll know each other more soon.

834
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:51,730
How long are you staying here?

835
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:59,040
I'll be right back.

836
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,080
Hey! Chill out!

837
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:08,880
You're breezing through the liquor.

838
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:09,990
Whatever.

839
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,650
Your lunch got stolen or something?

840
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,180
Hey, can I have a cigarette?

841
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:41,980
I'm out.

842
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:44,120
Are you messing with me?

843
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:47,270
Yes?

844
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:51,090
Do you think acting so damn polite

845
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:53,240
makes you a good person?

846
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:57,000
It never gets rid of the fact that
you ruined the reputation of the cafe.

847
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:58,560
What did I do?

848
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:00,630
As for the comments,

849
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:02,720
I've already deleted all of them.

850
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,530
Your friends still posted the video.

851
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:07,640
The video?

852
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,200
What video?

853
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,410
You're messing with me or something?

854
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:15,880
Yes.

855
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,120
Thank you.

856
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,140
Fucking...

857
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:26,680
He barks like a dog.

858
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,800
Hey, stop shooting!

859
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:41,810
You're doing this again.

860
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:44,780
Is it a big deal

861
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:48,120
if I donâ€™t wear my glasses?

862
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:50,520
I'd rather no one else lay their eyes on you
