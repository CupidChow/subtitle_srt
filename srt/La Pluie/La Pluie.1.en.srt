1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,870
I don't know what the world is like where you are,

3
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:14,270
but in the world where I live, there is a rare disease that is quite supernatural.

4
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:19,110
We call it "Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss”

5
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,510
Although the name may sound ordinary,

6
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,430
its symptoms are quite strange.

7
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,900
Some people say it's a miracle,

8
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,420
while others say it's a curse

9
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,550
because those who have this disease…

10
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,150
become deaf and can't hear anything every time it rains,

11
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:40,030
but everyone else can hear them normally.

12
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:09,830
This means that people with this disease are like they’re cut off from everything in the world,

13
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:12,110
and only silence is what they can hear.

14
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,950
Now, do you understand why it's called a curse?

15
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,350
In the medical field, this condition has been defined as

16
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:25,470
"Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss During Raining"

17
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,550
Forget it. It's quite complicated.

18
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,070
Certainly, many things in my world

19
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:39,470
were created to accommodate people with hearing loss.

20
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,230
But, it's not given much importance

21
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:48,190
because the number of people with hearing loss is only a small fraction of the population,

22
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:19,350
and people with this condition exist in all professions, and age groups.

23
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,470
So, they have to find ways to live and adapt

24
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,590
so as not to become a burden to society

25
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,310
and try to live as normally as possible.

26
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:35,550
The main problem that people with hearing loss face

27
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:38,400
[Honey,what would you like to eat?]

28
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:39,070
is their inability to communicate with those around them when it rains

29
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,920
[Anything. Up to you.]

30
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,190
or simply put,

31
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,310
to live with it as it is.

32
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:47,510
Excuse me,

33
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:50,190
could I order some food, please?

34
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:51,790
What would you like?

35
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,230
How about spaghetti alla carbonara?

36
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,270
And also seafood fried rice,

37
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,270
but without shrimp, please. My boyfriend is allergic to shrimp.

38
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:00,750
Okay.

39
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:04,070
Sorry about earlier. My boyfriend has hearing loss.

40
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,590
Oh, okay, please wait a moment then.

41
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:12,510
That table over there, you know, he has hearing loss.

42
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:16,230
Really? I want to have it too.

43
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,950
But it seems like his boyfriend doesn't have it.

44
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,500
If that's the case, she's not his soul...

45
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:23,750
Yes!

46
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,190
What would you like today?

47
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,790
[Rice with Pork and Garlic and Chicken Salad]

48
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:47,550
Oh, and this is me. I forgot to introduce myself.

49
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:51,470
My name is "Saengtai," and I am a columnist for a general-interest magazine.

50
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,790
I am trying to live a very ordinary and simple life,

51
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,909
to be happy and content on this planet.

52
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,590
Hello, Captain Phasma.

53
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:10,110
So, the first thing I came up with for communicating when it's raining

54
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:14,230
and suitable for my profession is Post-it.

55
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,910
Yes, that's right, Post-it.

56
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,150
It's easy and not complicated.

57
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:36,309
Actually, there is another important weird symptom of deafness

58
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:41,260
that some people have when they turn 20,

59
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:44,870
they will hear sounds and be able to communicate with their soulmate

60
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,990
or their true partner,

61
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:50,510
if there’s mutual rain where each of them is.

62
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:54,190
It’s what everybody might know as “rainverse.”

63
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:58,030
But I don't believe in the concept of so-called soulmate or true partner.

64
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,750
Why is that?

65
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:05,510
[2 years ago]

66
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,070
How was your day at school?

67
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,310
Hey Dad, I had fun.

68
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:11,100
-Let’s eat.
-Good afternoon.

69
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,270
Good afternoon, Mom.

70
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,270
Good afternoon.

71
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,590
Thank you.

72
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,550
Thank you.

73
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:52,070
Hmm, which kind of surprise is up today? Everyone is ready and waiting.

74
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:55,070
Normally we don't have a birthday party like this, right?

75
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,390
Today is our child's birthday.

76
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:08,590
-Okay
-I made it myself.

77
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,350
-I did an amazing job cooking.
-Thank you.

78
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,950
Come on, let's eat.

79
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,550
Thank you.

80
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,390
The birthday boy must eat more!

81
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:36,470
Is there something going on? Why does everyone look strange?

82
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:44,910
Um... Listen, Saengtai.

83
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:52,110
What I am about to say might be a bit difficult to hear.

84
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:01,150
You see, your mom and I have had some problems for a while now,

85
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:05,950
but we're both trying to find a way out and solve it.

86
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,790
But it's still...

87
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:13,710
Today, I asked you to come back, we’re here together.

88
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:16,710
And, I have something to tell you.

89
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:29,830
So, we decided to divorce.

90
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:37,910
This is the common wish of your mom and I.

91
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:44,900
You think this is funny? It is not funny at all.

92
00:11:55,270 --> 00:12:00,110
Don’t tell me you guys know this, so you just sit here in silence?

93
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:13,030
Mom, did you pressure dad again? Right!?

94
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:24,990
Hey, kid, listen to me. Nobody is right or wrong in this.

95
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:36,910
Someday when you grow up, you will learn that some things are beyond control.

96
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,990
Do you understand?

97
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:45,990
But your mom and I want you to know that we love you very much.

98
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:48,390
We love all of you so much.

99
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:55,190
Even though your mom and I won't be together or are apart from each other,

100
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:06,350
our love for you won't diminish. It remains the same.

101
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,910
We love you the same.

102
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,670
Saengtai

103
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:42,630
Tai

104
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:45,390
Tai

105
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,030
Are you okay?

106
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,470
Are you okay, Tai?

107
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:12,510
Tai, I am here.

108
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:02,630
[Tai, I'll be right outside with you.]

109
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:22,150
Hey, sorry. Are you hearing me?

110
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:30,830
Are you crying? Are you alright?

111
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:36,430
Yes. I have hearing loss either.

112
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:40,270
And then the day I heard my soulmate's voice for the first time in my life .

113
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:43,550
It was the same day my parents separated.

114
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:48,550
At that moment, I immediately decided that

115
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:51,950
I definitely would not pursue a relationship with my soulmate,

116
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:56,630
because even my parents, who were soulmates, could end their relationship.

117
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:01,190
There was no need to believe in the idea of true love for a soulmate anymore.

118
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:04,310
I wanted to defy my own destiny.

119
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:10,070
And, I will never answer my soul mate, ever.

120
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,900
Are you okay?

121
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,950
Why can't I hear your voice anymore?

122
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,830
Hello?

123
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,790
Nope. I’m definitely not going to answer.

124
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,270
Don't forget to take care of yourself.

125
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:15,950
Hello.

126
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:24,990
Ton, how is this customer's project going?

127
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,510
It should be confirmed by noon.

128
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,710
Ok. Please make it noon then.

129
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:28,990
Ok.

130
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,510
Saengtai!

131
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,790
Hello, Bow.

132
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,270
Come here.

133
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:41,710
Any idea for next month’s content?

134
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,990
Tai. Let’s come into the office often, shall we?

135
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:50,510
or can we think about the content together?

136
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:54,150
Maybe we can help increase the number of readers.

137
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:59,710
Hmm, that’s a good idea. The boss would like it.

138
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:02,830
For the idea,

139
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:06,030
I think it would be good to write something about health care.

140
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:10,470
Great, loving it already.

141
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,830
Health care?

142
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,990
People who loves to take care of their health.

143
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:25,470
Let's make it "Love Sick" or something like that.

144
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,990
Maybe "Six Pack."

145
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:32,230
I’m ready to search for the supporting images.

146
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,070
Okay, then let's talk about it later.

147
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,950
Today, I will go store some things in and then will go  to the coffee shop.

148
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:45,030
Tai, are you going to work outside again?

149
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:53,350
Tai, no one will not know Saengtai anymore, unless it’s me.

150
00:18:55,190 --> 00:19:00,630
Like, that one. Do you know her name?

151
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:12,070
I understand. But, I rather do things in my own way.

152
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:18,630
Tai, I got it.

153
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:22,150
But we can’t live alone in this world.

154
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:24,910
You can’t know just Bow.

155
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:28,870
I want you to smile to others.

156
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:32,550
And, I like when you talk to others.

157
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:39,550
Ok. I give up. Can’t force anyone anyway.

158
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:44,070
So, if it’s not too much here, I’ll follow you to the coffee shop.

159
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,510
Ok.

160
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:46,670
More smile, please.

161
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,990
Scary.

162
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:54,070
Follow it up. Must be done by noon, okay?

163
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:56,990
-Toon, who are you chatting with?
-Following it up for you now.

164
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:59,990
What's up with that group? No chitchatting, please?

165
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,350
Noon, don't forget. Must be finished by noon!

166
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,030
Order, please.

167
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:20,760
Can I get a cup of hot latte, please?

168
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,060
Okay,one moment,please.

169
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:53,910
Dressing appropriately for your profession nowadays.

170
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,870
Each person's daily life is different from one another.

171
00:20:56,870 --> 00:21:00,550
We should wear items that match our profession, such as headphones and headbands.

172
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:03,630
As for work attire, a watch should be added.

173
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:06,070
But if we're going to read at a cafe,

174
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,870
this is a fashion battlefield.

175
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:15,590
Glasses are a must, a jacket for the cold, and the bag must be chic!

176
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:20,380
Hey! You're crazy!

177
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:34,670
Don't make me try to keep up.

178
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,710
Riding a bicycle on the sidewalk like that?

179
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:41,350
What will you do if you hit someone and they die? Who will take responsibility?

180
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:46,470
If I catch you, I'll beat you up!

181
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:53,550
Should be a blessing they didn’t hit your head with a stick.

182
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,830
What's with the anger?

183
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:03,350
Tien, I know you don't like this kind of thing, but you need to stay calm sometimes.

184
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,910
Do you understand?

185
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,750
Yes, sir.

186
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,470
Don’t you have to study?

187
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,110
Got an afternoon class.

188
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:19,790
You? Why don’t you work at the office?

189
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:24,670
Oh, can you stop talking like Baw?

190
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:28,990
How do you know I’m here? Why didn’t you text me?

191
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:34,590
Who am I? Your beloved little bro.

192
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:38,510
Even you disappear, I will always find you.

193
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:39,790
My beloved little bro?

194
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:40,750
Course.

195
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:41,900
Come here.

196
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,070
Ouch!

197
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,510
I missed.

198
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:50,790
Always.

199
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:58,070
Anyway, I’m here to tell you,

200
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,710
don’t forget the appointment with mom.

201
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:02,350
Sunday, at home.

202
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,110
Got it.

203
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:13,350
You think there will be only us?

204
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:16,630
No idea.

205
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:25,350
This is the first time since they separated.

206
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,030
Mom just invited us for a meal.

207
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:31,350
Plus, she said she wanted to talk.

208
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:33,870
About what?

209
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:39,630
You think I should call and ask Saengjan and Saengnuea?

210
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:40,990
In case they know.

211
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:44,830
Hello?

212
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:47,150
Yo, bro?

213
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:50,870
Just don’t freeze like that?

214
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:55,950
Don’t call. Just go and we’ll know.

215
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:57,630
But I want to know.

216
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:58,990
Impatient, you are.

217
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,110
What?

218
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:12,190
Almost done? I want to go to a bookshop. Wanna come with?

219
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,470
A bookshop?

220
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:19,470
-Yes.
-Ok. Let’s go! But let me finish it here a little. Almost done.

221
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:24,230
You just be quiet, ok? Do not disturb.

222
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,470
Okay.

223
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:31,350
Hi! May I get a cup of latte?

224
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:35,510
Didn’t I say “do not disturb”?

225
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:37,790
Americano’s nice too!

226
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:38,670
Hey!

227
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,470
I’m ordering a coffee here??

228
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:41,230
Zip it!

229
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:42,190
Ok.

230
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:11,390
Oh, it’s so cool in here.

231
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,470
Do you want something?

232
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:15,470
Let me walk around first.

233
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,750
What happened?

234
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:21,910
Nope. Definitely not gonna answer.

235
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:25,390
Yesterday, I answered the soulmate.

236
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:29,070
Wow! Really? What’d he say?

237
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:35,710
He talked back, but I didn’t continue the conversation.

238
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:39,710
Tai, just answer to him for once.

239
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:44,270
He’s been talking alone for 2 years. Where’s you empathy?

240
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:55,590
You know, this world has 99.999999% of people

241
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:59,510
who envy a person like you. That includes me.

242
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:05,430
No need to envy me. Need I remind this is a disease?

243
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:11,430
Tai, I know you’re lonely.

244
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:17,630
Open your heart. Lose the stupid terms you set.

245
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:22,100
Wait, was that an insult to me? Really?

246
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:36,380
Tien. A man like you? In a bookshop?

247
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:39,390
What about you?

248
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:45,230
Look. "Put The Love in Her, Fakie Lil Sister" is having a new volume, guys!

249
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:47,830
Been waiting for it!

250
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:50,460
When will you guys quit reading a sexual novel?

251
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:54,590
Watch your mouth, bro!

252
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:56,030
Calm down, bro.

253
00:26:56,030 --> 00:27:00,390
We call it a light novel. A good stuff, it is.

254
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:02,150
Light novel huh…
-Yes.

255
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,910
Whatever you like.

256
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:08,190
Are you Saengtai?

257
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:10,990
Yes.

258
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:13,950
This is my big brother.

259
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:17,670
Good afternoon!!

260
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:26,510
Tien always talked about you. Haven’t met you until now.

261
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:30,910
What did you say about me?

262
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:33,550
Oh, just complaints about you.

263
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,710
Guys, please don’t.

264
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:40,510
Or you’re in a bookshop because of your big bro?

265
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:43,030
No, I was the one who got him here actually.

266
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,310
For real?

267
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,150
Yeah.

268
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,230
I want to buy a movie magazine.

269
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,590
Huh?

270
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:56,020
Got a problem?

271
00:27:56,230 --> 00:28:00,790
Known you for years, didn’t know you read movie magazines.

272
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:03,580
I read them when I’m not with you guys.

273
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:07,150
It might not sound right, but I love what I study.

274
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:12,110
Ok. I got you now. The passion’s there, man.

275
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,350
Of course.

276
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:16,430
We’re gonna go eat. Do you wanna come along? We’ll wait outside.

277
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:19,070
I’m fine. Let me buy some books here.

278
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,430
Alright then.

279
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,830
Good bye!!

280
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:25,710
Ok. Bye.

281
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,310
You guys seem close.

282
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:37,510
Film students are like this. Got the whole gang there.

283
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,510
Tai!!!

284
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:53,470
Tai! I’ve been looking for this one. This one!!

285
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:02,750
Ok? Congrats.

286
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,510
I’ll be back.

287
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:28,670
Where are you going?

288
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,990
Lomfon

289
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:47,630
What?

290
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:50,870
That one is mine.

291
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:53,910
Did you buy it?

292
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:59,630
No, but I took it down from the shelf. I reserved it.

293
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:02,830
I just wanted to see other books , so I put it down here first.

294
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:05,510
Meaning you didn't buy it, right?

295
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:07,950
But, I reserved it.

296
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:13,470
But, you didn’t buy it. How can you say it’s yours?

297
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:17,630
Give me that.

298
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,310
What?

299
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:23,790
You can’t take what I reserved!

300
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:27,230
If you didn’t buy it, it’s not yours?

301
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,150
Are you trying to get me mad?

302
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:30,390
No.

303
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:35,390
No wonder why you don’t have friends.

304
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,510
Friends like you. No thanks.

305
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:40,190
What’d you say? Do you want a fight? Huh?

306
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:42,710
Hey! Tien! What do you think you’re doing?

307
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:47,430
He took what’s mine. So annoying. So rude!He didn't.

308
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:50,710
Watch your mouth. We’re in public.

309
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,910
Tell me. What happened?

310
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:56,500
You saw me. I took this book out.

311
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:00,830
From here. Then, I put it down here.

312
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:03,350
Because I wanted to look for other books first.

313
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:06,150
Then, when I was back, this freak was trying to check out this book.

314
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:07,670
Look at him.

315
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:09,630
Do you get it?

316
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,910
I apologize for my brother.

317
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:17,150
Hey, Tai!

318
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,910
-What?
-Aren’t you listening to me?

319
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,030
I am.

320
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:24,470
You took that book out, right?
-Yes.

321
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:27,230
Then, you put it down here and walked away.

322
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:29,950
-I walked just there.
-You didn’t pay for it.

323
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:33,110
So, others can take it away. They have every right to.

324
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:34,740
What?

325
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:37,030
Are you Saentien’s brother?

326
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:39,670
Yes. Saengtai here.

327
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,870
I’m Lomfon.

328
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:44,550
I think your brother doesn’t make any sense.

329
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:46,790
You are not making any sense.
-Tien,Don't do this.

330
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:49,350
Anyway, thank you.

331
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:50,830
Ok.

332
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:51,950
I’m gonna go.

333
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,390
Tai!

334
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,470
Give me my book!

335
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,790
Calm down.

336
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:04,030
There’s none of it anymore.

337
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:07,350
Is it necessary to get that angry to him?

338
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,780
Yes, it is necessary. That was the last one.

339
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:11,790
Please calm down? You are a grown man.

340
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:15,110
Plus, they are gonna put more of it on the shelf. You can buy it then.

341
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:17,670
If they had had it, I wouldn’t have waited for it. There’s no more.

342
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:21,070
How do you know? Go ask them. Now.

343
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:26,230
You’re too loud. This is public. How many times do I have to remind you?

344
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:27,550
So talkative! Boasting all the time!

345
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:37,510
Hey you! You’re not small anymore!

346
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:40,190
You three are hugging. I wanna be part of it too.

347
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:42,390
Ok, little son.

348
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:10,110
I'm waiting for the person who is meant to be with me.

349
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:14,270
The one whose heart matches mine.

350
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:19,510
Is that person you?

351
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:22,350
The guitar sound fades…

352
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,150
The rain…

353
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:31,860
I'm sorry, I just realized.

354
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:35,469
Am I bothering you?

355
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:41,630
Tai, I know you're feeling lonely.

356
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:45,150
Just open your heart to him a little.

357
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,670
Stop setting silly rules for yourself.

358
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:00,910
If that's the case, I'll stay quiet for you.

359
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:03,990
Um... I can sing some more if you want.

360
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:10,630
I'm actually working on a new song.

361
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,350
So, I want to practice singing it better.

362
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:16,510
In that case... I consider it a favor if you listen to me, okay?

363
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:20,950
Even if you can't hear the guitar sound.

364
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:29,470
Just try to use your heart listening to mine.

365
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:37,590
Just allow me to use my heart and tell you

366
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:41,030
That there's only you, and I keep saying I love you.

367
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:43,630
And, it belongs to you alone.

368
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:49,270
I'm still waiting for you to listen to my heart.

369
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:54,630
Cause you’re my destiny

370
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:00,470
Well, how was that?

371
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:05,550
If you don't answer, I'll be embarrassed.

372
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:10,150
I guess it's better if I don't bother you anymore.

373
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:15,590
Then, I'll stay quiet until the rain stops, okay?

374
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:26,070
[The thing you told me this afternoon is actually going great.]

375
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:28,430
[What thing?]

376
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:48,750
Having fun?

377
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:53,790
Chatting with me?

378
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:57,270
To a dog, maybe?

379
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:05,310
Well, it’s good. There’s an analysis of Japanese and Korean movies of this month.

380
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:10,910
Oh, so you’re not smart enough to analyze on your own.

381
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:15,150
So you have to read other people's thoughts from books.

382
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:22,510
I just found out that the top student like you…

383
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:25,830
is not so good at analyzing movies himself.

384
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:29,870
I just want multiple perspectives from various analysts.

385
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:36,230
So, that’s why you got a high score by taking all the ideas from there, right?

386
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:40,150
No wonder, you wanted the book so badly that you have to steal from me.

387
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:43,110
And then you forgot about manners.

388
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:45,390
Why are you so good at arguing?

389
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:48,590
Don't you want this book too?

390
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:51,030
And you still dare to ask me?

391
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:55,710
Yes, but I just want to read the director's interviews,

392
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:59,430
not just copy the analysis in a very stupid way like you do.

393
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:19,750
It's true. Stupid people like you can't even think like the analysts.

394
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:20,510
Hey!

395
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:27,470
Hey! Why are we arguing here? You’re making too much noise.

396
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:30,830
Pingpong, Lomfon annoys me.

397
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:33,990
I was sitting here reading my books, and you just came in bothering me.

398
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:34,830
Not me. It’s you.

399
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:38,910
Stop right there, I heard you guys arguing.

400
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:41,310
Is it about the book?

401
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:44,350
Breastfeeding’s needed still?

402
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:49,990
You're already in your second year of college, and freaking chose the same film major.

403
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:54,630
Both of you will need to work together.

404
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:57,310
-What's the point of arguing?
-You ask the guy yourself.

405
00:39:57,310 --> 00:40:01,270
But okay, if you want to argue, let's do it. Go ahead.

406
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:03,030
But do it quietly.

407
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:05,150
Don't disturb others around you.

408
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:07,750
They paid tuition just like you guys did.

409
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:11,630
Or maybe there, better for you guys. Have you seen that fence over there?

410
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:14,630
Do you want to fight outside?

411
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:20,030
I'm leaving. Professor Golf will be here soon.

412
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:24,390
But if you're going to fight, tell me who wins and who loses.

413
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,310
I want to know.

414
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:29,150
You guys are so childish.

415
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:34,390
So loud, you two!

416
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:43,630
What are you looking at?

417
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:57,390
Tai! Wait for me!

418
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:58,630
Bye.

419
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,470
Let me go with you.

420
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:01,670
-Go with me?
-Yes.

421
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:04,870
I’m taking a bus. You don’t like taking a bus.

422
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:07,990
Change of attitude now.

423
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:10,790
Besides, I want to chat with you.

424
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:16,790
Hey, we don’t talk anymore, do we?

425
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:21,190
By the way, why do you like to take a bus so much? Aren't you tired?

426
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:24,710
I am not really in a rush.

427
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:28,750
Taking a bus gives me a chance to think about things.

428
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,750
It’s fun.

429
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:32,830
It’s fun, huh?

430
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:35,020
It’s quite annoying, is it?

431
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:38,030
Tai! Wait!

432
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:45,790
Tai, please wait.

433
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:48,950
You know, Tai, let us…

434
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:56,310
Oh… that look. Don’t you think of it.

435
00:41:58,190 --> 00:41:59,380
I think it bites me.

436
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:08,190
Tai! We don’t even know if it got vaccinated. Let’s leave it alone.

437
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:10,430
It’s not worth it if it bites you.

438
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:14,030
Hey, don’t be scared. I’m here to help.

439
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:17,150
You sure are such a good listener.

440
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:21,630
Maybe, the name’s Duer.

441
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:24,270
Now, naming it. Great.

442
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,110
Are you scared?

443
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,580
I'm scared to death

444
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:34,150
Oh wait. Don’t take it home, please.

445
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:40,150
I already feel we click.

446
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:43,830
You don’t listen to me.

447
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:47,790
Tai! Tai! Where are you taking it?

448
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:50,790
Where are you going?

449
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:51,390
Tai!

450
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:54,110
Whose cat is it? We have no clue. And has it got vaccinated?

451
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:55,870
Tai, listen to me please.

452
00:42:56,190 --> 00:43:00,470
Tai, why don’t you just listen to me?

453
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:06,230
Hello? Tai, if you want to have a cat,

454
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:10,870
you can buy one from a farm. Good breed, good price.

455
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:16,150
I can recommend my friend to you. She’s crazy about cats.

456
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:17,910
Bow.

457
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:21,990
Look at its face.

458
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:25,630
So cute.

459
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:31,750
Alright… I give up.

460
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:36,270
But you need to know that cats always bring their own problems.

461
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:40,030
If you want to have them, you need to study the problems.

462
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:44,070
Like, cat litter, we must choose the odorless one,

463
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:47,070
because cats …

464
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,460
So cute.

465
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:58,190
Um. I meant that person over there.

466
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:28,950
We’re here.

467
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:33,310
How is your new home? Warm?

468
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:37,910
Hmm?

469
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:41,710
Go.

470
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:46,750
Hope you like it here.

471
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:49,110
Hey, what are you doing?

472
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:55,790
I guess it’s better than straying outside.

473
00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:57,710
I got that right?

474
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:00,070
Let's dry you up.

475
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:03,020
So dirty, you.

476
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:14,350
So cute. I meant the person over there.

477
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:32,550
Why do I want to talk to him now though I haven’t answered him for 2 years?

478
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:35,110
Was it the right decision?

479
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:37,150
It’s right, right?

480
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:39,150
Right?

481
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:18,830
Hey you… It rains again.

482
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:21,590
It rains there too?

483
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:27,790
About last afternoon, I’m sorry.

484
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:31,390
I was with my friends and wouldn’t stop talking.

485
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:36,470
Actually, I have something to tell you.

486
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:41,390
I have decided that…

487
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:44,030
What?

488
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:49,310
Did it have to stop now?

489
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:15,230
Last night, what was he going to say?

490
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:19,230
The rain shouldn’t stop.

491
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:33,590
Excuse me.

492
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:40,990
What’s happening here today?

493
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:42,350
We apologize.

494
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:47,190
Today, we have an activity to exchange coupons with free drinks first day.

495
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:50,430
So, there are lots of them here.

496
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:52,990
Sorry for the inconvenience.

497
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:55,510
Oh. No problem.

498
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:58,790
Ok. Are you interested in any more drinks?

499
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:02,950
This one is good. It is our signature.

500
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:07,670
Well, I think I’ll order later. I’ll call you.

501
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:10,670
Alright. Thank you.

502
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:16,740
Can I talk to the manager?

503
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:08,790
I’m sorry. Can I sit with you?

504
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:15,910
Oh. Yes, you can.

505
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:17,590
Thank you.

506
00:50:17,310 --> 00:50:18,550
Are you alright?

507
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:25,870
It’s ok.

508
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:29,830
Did I grab you too hard?

509
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:32,190
No.

510
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:34,510
Thanks for the help.

511
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:41,870
Are you a writer?

512
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:44,590
Yes.

513
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:47,990
What do you write?

514
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:53,390
Um… Just general content.

515
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:56,390
Fashion and everything else.

516
00:50:58,390 --> 00:51:00,990
Oh. You sound cool.

517
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:07,310
Where do you write for? Maybe I know it.

518
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:10,500
La Boy Magazine.

519
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:13,270
I think I used to read that one.

520
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:14,430
Really?

521
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:19,150
Yeah. It just got through my eyes some other times, you know.

522
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:26,990
What about your name? In case I can follow you.

523
00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:33,510
Pen name, you mean?

524
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:36,910
Do we call it that? Pen name?

525
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:39,270
Yes. It’s Saengtai.

526
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:44,830
Saengtai… Sounds very cool.

527
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:47,670
Sounds like there's something good going on.

528
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:51,470
A lot of people have said that.

529
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:53,870
Saengtai.

530
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:03,390
Hello? What’s up?

531
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:09,950
Emergency case? Ok. See you at the hospital.

532
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:21,710
I gotta run.
