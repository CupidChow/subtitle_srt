1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,790
I think I might have found "the one".

3
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:24,590
He's a vet?

4
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:25,910
Yes.

5
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:27,500
"Duer".

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,310
Normally, how many vets do we have here?

7
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,950
I'm sorry. That won't happen again.

8
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:37,310
It's fascinating to discover someone who shares my passions - just like you, don't you think?

9
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:19,870
I am starving!

10
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,910
When's he gonna come?

11
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:26,590
I think, just a moment more. Another easy case of his.

12
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:28,950
Here.

13
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,190
Like I told you,

14
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,870
please keep the wound dry.

15
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,910
We'll have a check-up in the next three days.

16
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,740
If nothing goes wrong, next week we can remove the suture.

17
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,829
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

18
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:41,870
-Thanks.
-Bye bye.

19
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,710
Have a safe trip home.

20
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,350
Are you a doctor or a windbag?

21
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,110
Ten years had passed before you came out.

22
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:57,030
What? A pet owner always needs good explanations.

23
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,070
Like we don't know your habits?

24
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,430
You always beat a dead horse.

25
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:06,430
If you are really passionate about animals, you must own an animal hospital.

26
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,070
I do now.

27
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,310
Come on!

28
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,030
I'm hungry. You guys talk a lot of words.

29
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:14,430
I am so hungry.

30
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,340
Enough.

31
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,390
OK, we're leaving.

32
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:20,180
Let's go, but where?

33
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:20,829
Same place?

34
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:21,910
Great.

35
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,350
Okay.

36
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,230
How do we go?

37
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,870
I'll have to come back for Fluke and Ruj.

38
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,070
Besides, looks like it's gonna rain.

39
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,100
So, I can drive.

40
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,110
Good choice.

41
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,430
Can you just remove the duck?

42
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,270
-Go!
-Let's eat vege today!

43
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,430
My beloved bro, Saengtai.

44
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:46,310
You didn't listen to me?

45
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,829
Hello?

46
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:54,470
Tai, if you want to have a cat, you can buy one from a farm.

47
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,790
Good breed, good price.

48
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,470
I can recommend my friend to you.

49
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,030
She's crazy about cats.

50
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:08,310
Let me say thank you.

51
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,790
Come on, Fin!

52
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:13,430
You love singing so much, why not quit your job as a vet?

53
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:16,029
Should I? Fluke and Ruj are gonna be okay?

54
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:21,070
-And can the clinic survive without me?
-Fin, wait! It's a joke. Didn't you know that?

55
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,510
Yeah, I was joking.

56
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,510
Really?

57
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,310
Man, I expect something.

58
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,590
Expect what?

59
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,790
Bow, look.

60
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,510
Isn't it adorable?

61
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:37,550
OK. I give up.

62
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:41,190
I'll just explain about cat issues.

63
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:45,630
Like, cat litter, we must choose the odorless one,

64
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,390
so cats will not...

65
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:52,909
It's raining now.

66
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:54,190
Right.

67
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,670
Traffic jam, for sure.

68
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,670
So cute.

69
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:06,150
Guys, who is Patts complementing?

70
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:09,350
Maybe me. I am cute to Patts!

71
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,710
No way.

72
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,660
Who is cute?

73
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,270
Does he mean the woman who's talking to herself?

74
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,900
Maybe not.

75
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,710
The woman might not be his type.

76
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,260
I don't think so, too.

77
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,910
It's the boy petting the cat.

78
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:34,150
-Where? I don't see him.
-Next to the woman.

79
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:37,140
Oh, he is really cute.

80
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,230
Yes, I can see.

81
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,990
You have weak eyes.

82
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,430
What are you typing to him?

83
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,909
[I just tease him that complimenting someone when it rains...]

84
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:53,310
[won't make his soul mate feel down?]

85
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,430
You, take a peek!

86
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,070
No can do.

87
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,190
I got a privacy screen protector.

88
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,790
Just because I got friends like you guys!

89
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,670
What?

90
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,670
Just read. What's he saying?

91
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:14,550
He says, "He's not gonna be down. He doesn't care about me on rainy basis. And, the cat is really cute."

92
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,750
Hello?

93
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,710
Where did you zone out to?

94
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,310
Hello?

95
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:26,110
Ah, I guess he really doesn't care about him.

96
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:29,510
Patts has been talking to him for 2 years, but he never answered.

97
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:33,350
No, but there were 2 times he answered.

98
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,870
It's just not quite a willing answer.

99
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,990
Answer for an answer's sake, you know?

100
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:40,470
Our friend is so unlucky.

101
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,750
I understand Patts.

102
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:50,590
Hearing loss makes everything harder for him.

103
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:53,110
I know, totally.

104
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:56,310
Look, it's already hard for us to communicate with him.

105
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,630
Yeah.

106
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:04,350
Then, when he falls for, likes or loves someone,

107
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,830
it's his right.

108
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,510
-Cool words, you just said.
-So touching.

109
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,140
I know, right?

110
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,190
You got the right words today.

111
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,430
I always got the right words.

112
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,590
-Then, take us to a buffet!
-What the?

113
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,030
The car behind just honks!

114
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,030
Why do they hunk at me?

115
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,550
They hunk… they "honk"!

116
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:21,430
-Yes, they honk!
-Just go, go, go.

117
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:24,430
Hello? Are you zoning out?

118
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:28,990
Saengtai!

119
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,750
It's raining.

120
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,990
Tai's got hearing loss for sure.

121
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:41,350
So, you didn't hear what I just said, did you?

122
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:44,950
Geez!

123
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,390
OK, let me recap this.

124
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,110
One cup of iced americano.

125
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,670
Two cups of iced latte.

126
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,790
Not sweet for one.

127
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,270
Half sweet for the other.

128
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,950
One grapefruit coffee.

129
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:59,230
One cup of iced green tea. Correct?

130
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,590
That is correct.

131
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:05,550
Alright. I have to go. Gonna get in line.

132
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:06,110
Please get in the line first.

133
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,830
We've got a lot of customers today.

134
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:15,150
Can I talk to the manager?

135
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,510
Excuse me.

136
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,910
Are you the manager?

137
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,190
Yes.

138
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:36,270
I have an idea how to fix the situation.

139
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:39,430
I used to go to a coffee shop in Japan. They separated the line into two.

140
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:41,630
One is for the customers with coupons.

141
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:45,390
The other is for the customers who want a normal payment.

142
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,150
Then, you let each person in each line take turns to pay.

143
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:51,230
This ensures the faster and more organized process.

144
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,030
Try it.

145
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,070
Thank you so much.

146
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,350
You're welcome.

147
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,510
Excuse me. Excuse me.

148
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,750
We are sorry for the inconvenience.

149
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,550
For all customers to get our good coffee,

150
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:05,180
could you please form 2 lines?

151
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,790
The line for those who want to use your coupons is this way.

152
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,950
This way.

153
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,710
The line for those who will pay cash

154
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:13,910
is on the left.

155
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:17,350
If my turn is up, please get me one americano first.

156
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,070
Okay.

157
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,390
Thank you.

158
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,030
Anything else?

159
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,390
No, thank you.

160
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:36,900
Hello, sir. We've got your coffee.

161
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:42,870
This coffee is specially made for you, sir.

162
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:43,790
Thank you so much.

163
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,110
Pleasure.

164
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,550
Excuse me.

165
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:24,150
May I sit here?

166
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,190
Sure.

167
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,190
Thank you.

168
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:45,990
Are you okay?

169
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:57,750
I'm fine.

170
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:04,780
I'm sorry. Did I grab you too hard?

171
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:09,590
No, no. Thanks for the help, actually.

172
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:17,110
Are you some sort of a writer, by the way?

173
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,350
Yes, I am.

174
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,630
What do you write about?

175
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:26,110
Well, it's...

176
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,950
If you are not comfortable, you don't have to tell me.

177
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:38,030
No, no. I just write about stuff.

178
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:40,790
Fashion and everything else.

179
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:45,350
Fashion? So cool.

180
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:56,270
Do you write in any company or press?

181
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,270
Maybe I'd know it.

182
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,030
La Boy Magazine.

183
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:04,020
La Boy?

184
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,470
I think I used to read it.

185
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,740
-Really?
-Yeah.

186
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:16,510
I used to have a quick read or see it online.

187
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,750
And, what's your name?

188
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,910
So, I can follow you.

189
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,390
A pen name, you mean?

190
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:28,870
Maybe that. They call a pen name?

191
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:34,150
Yes. Saengtai, it is.

192
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,430
Saengtai, right?

193
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,350
Sounds cool.

194
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:43,300
Sounds profound.

195
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,590
A lot of people say that.

196
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:57,950
Hey, what's up?

197
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:00,470
Patts, we need you to come back.

198
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,750
Emergency case?

199
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:04,350
Yes. A lot.

200
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,790
Okay, I'll be right back.

201
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,870
See you at the hospital.

202
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:14,630
Hey, I have to go.

203
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,750
See you around.

204
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:38,710
Hey, what is your name?

205
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,550
Huh?

206
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:47,670
Patts. My name is Patts.

207
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:56,550
Wait a moment, you.

208
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,310
[Patts…]

209
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:22,660
You?

210
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,590
Are you there?

211
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,860
[Yes.]

212
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:34,790
Last night rain stopped before I finished, right?

213
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,780
[And, for the evening, I'm sorry.]

214
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:44,790
[I was with friends and talked a lot in your ears.]

215
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:47,830
[I had something to tell you.]

216
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:51,270
[I now decide that…]

217
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:56,790
What? Did it have to stop now??

218
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,750
Yeah.

219
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:19,790
Well, I think I will defy my destiny.

220
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,349
How so?

221
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:31,790
I think I might have found "the one".

222
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:41,150
I know it's none of your business.

223
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:44,510
Having been talking in your ears for 2 years might be annoying enough.

224
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:54,710
But... thanks a lot for listening.

225
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:57,430
OK.

226
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,590
Duer?

227
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,070
Duer?

228
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,030
Duer?

229
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,510
Oh, Patts?

230
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,390
You said you were…

231
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:12,990
Hey, Patts. Duer ran away when I was giving it a vaccine.

232
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,390
It must be afraid.

233
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,590
Do you need my help?

234
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,950
I think we're OK. I think…

235
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,270
That's lovely! Patts!

236
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:26,590
Because it's obedient to you more than anyone else.

237
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:28,310
Can you help me?

238
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:39,190
Alright. I'll have to kindly ask you to be outside for now.

239
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,590
The cat was panicking.

240
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,110
Might be because there were several people around.

241
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,470
Okay.

242
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,950
Hello.

243
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,950
Hi, Saengtai?

244
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:01,990
Yes? What happened again?

245
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,990
Can you bring Duer here?

246
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,310
Here we go.

247
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:15,150
Sorry, bud. Okay.

248
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,150
Hmm.

249
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:21,550
You don't have to be scared anymore.

250
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:25,030
It's not as bad as you think, right?

251
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,990
You know,

252
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:36,270
cats are easier to be stressed than most people think.

253
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:40,990
They quickly perceive emotions and tone of voice.

254
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:44,510
And, we can barely satisfy them.

255
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,350
Thus, when we talk to them,

256
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:52,150
We need to use soft...

257
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,950
and sincere voice.

258
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:56,950
So, they feel safe and relax.

259
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,100
You think so?

260
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:09,550
Gently touching and massaging it in a quiet room like this,

261
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:13,790
is one of the ways to get them relaxed.

262
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:19,990
In fact, we should do it to them often.

263
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:24,470
So, they feel secure and relaxed.

264
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:31,190
Alright. I'll let you hold Duer.

265
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,830
I'm getting a vaccine for it.

266
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,070
Yes. Okay.

267
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,550
Gently hold its body.

268
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,110
Remember not too tightly.

269
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,470
Just enough to hold it when it thinks of running away.

270
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,060
Alright.

271
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,590
May I?

272
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,430
Like this.

273
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,670
Like this.

274
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,260
OK.

275
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,830
Just a sec.

276
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:17,670
Hang on, Duer.

277
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,190
You got it?

278
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:22,710
I'll treat you with good snacks when we're back home.

279
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,350
Good good.

280
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,590
I'm going to inject, okay?

281
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:35,150
Wow.

282
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:37,620
Duer is now calm and stopped meowing.

283
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:43,990
It's because you have made it feel relaxed.

284
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,750
Correct?

285
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:51,070
You did great, Duer.

286
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:53,590
Next jab, you better be good like this.

287
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:57,510
And relaxed like this, right?

288
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:02,950
[So cute.]

289
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:06,190
[I mean that guy over there.]

290
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,110
What happened?

291
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,110
No, nothing.

292
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,710
Are we done?

293
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,190
Yes.

294
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:55,550
Hey, what are you doing?

295
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:57,150
Are you insane?

296
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:59,190
I brought you here to work.

297
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:01,110
The deadline is tomorrow.

298
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:03,350
And you're watching videos now?

299
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,110
How do you know I ain't doing anything?

300
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,630
I am watching you.

301
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:08,030
I am resting.

302
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,350
All right? Where? Where is your idea?

303
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:13,350
You talk a lot like this, let me see yours.

304
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,950
So many words from that mouth.

305
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,030
This is all I have found.

306
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,150
I put it on the slides for a start.

307
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,950
So when we present, it's easier.

308
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,510
Poor.

309
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,870
Flawed.

310
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,110
Looking cheap.

311
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,630
Unsatisfactory.

312
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,430
Poor.

313
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,910
Poor!

314
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:43,790
If you don't like it then where is your idea?

315
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:48,470
All right, just wait a moment.

316
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,710
Like I said,

317
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:05,110
these two vaccines are the two basic vaccines that it needs to get.

318
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:09,500
The alternative vaccine like the one for leukemia,

319
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,270
you need to get it in for a blood check first.

320
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:15,270
If you want, I can explain more?

321
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:18,150
Never mind.

322
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,670
I'll make my own decision.

323
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:24,590
Okay.

324
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:28,190
Do you have something going on in your mind?

325
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,190
Nothing.

326
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,390
Are we quite finished here?

327
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:35,630
Yes.

328
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:44,390
Come, Duer.

329
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,470
If you'll excuse us, I have to go.

330
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:54,430
He's coming.

331
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:19,150
Why are you here? Isn't today your day off?

332
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:22,070
Got an emergency case.

333
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,750
I didn't think I'd see him.

334
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:27,550
Can we call it a lucky day then?

335
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,230
Yeah, it's a lucky day.

336
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,990
How was it? Did he seem to like you?

337
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:34,630
Flirting with a person.

338
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,550
It's not as easy as fishing, you know.

339
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:38,150
Well, fishing is hard.

340
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:39,910
Oh, shut up!

341
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:53,270
Actually, I didn't flirt with him there.

342
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,830
I was working.

343
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:59,190
Then, if you're out of work, you'll flirt?

344
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,750
I think so, yes.

345
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:06,230
But I'm asking about when you're at work, how was it?

346
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:14,070
I have no idea.

347
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,950
It felt like I couldn't read his mind.

348
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:21,910
I don't know what he's thinking or what he's feeling.

349
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:24,830
He barely answered me when I asked him something.

350
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:27,030
Sounds a lot like your soul mate.

351
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:32,110
If you think this is rough, my soul mate is worse.

352
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:37,670
Forget it. Since you're here, let's go eat.

353
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:40,150
-But you pay, all right?
-Yeah.

354
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:43,110
Sure.

355
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:46,670
But perhaps later. Already had a plan.

356
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:50,230
Like a superstar's schedule.

357
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:52,430
Maybe you should get a manager.

358
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:54,310
The one who manages your time.

359
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,950
Why don't you come and be my manager?

360
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:57,510
I'll brush you before you go to sleep.

361
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,510
Are you implying that I'm a dog?

362
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,550
Bark for me?

363
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,350
Woof woof.

364
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,670
You're playing along with him now?

365
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:03,910
He told me to bark.

366
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:06,070
Just same as dogs. Got to go!

367
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:22,630
I'll treat you with snacks when we get back home, all right?

368
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,070
Meow meow.

369
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:53,110
Hey you, where are you going?

370
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:57,270
Home.

371
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:58,710
Are you taking the bus?

372
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:00,550
Do you want me to drive you?

373
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:01,830
What?

374
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:04,950
I mean, do you want me to give you a ride home?

375
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:07,350
Looks like it's gonna rain now.

376
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:09,390
Never mind. I can take the bus.

377
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:11,990
No hard feelings.

378
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:16,310
We don't know each other at all.

379
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,950
You are Saengtai, right?

380
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,110
I'm Patts.

381
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:25,710
See, we know each other now.

382
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:28,910
Um, I think you better go first.

383
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:31,070
I prefer to take the bus.

384
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,670
What's wrong with him?

385
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:51,190
What does he want from me?

386
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:55,230
[I think I will defy my destiny.]

387
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,350
How so?

388
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,510
[I think I might have found "the one".]

389
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:07,870
[Sorry, let's talk later.]

390
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,630
Playboy.

391
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,150
What are you doing here?

392
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:28,750
You insisted on taking the bus.

393
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:31,310
I thought I would wait with you.

394
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:10,630
Here. This is my idea.

395
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:19,030
This is your brother's article.

396
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:25,350
Wait, how do you know it's my brother's article?

397
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:30,470
Well, I like to read articles from the internet.

398
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:33,780
And this article has your brother's picture on it.

399
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,990
I remember him.

400
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:40,070
So what's wrong with the article my brother wrote?

401
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:43,550
Your brother's article is good.

402
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:46,150
But how do you turn that into a documentary?

403
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:49,150
It's your job. I've found this for you.

404
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:53,030
No, you just showed me the article written by your brother.

405
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:55,670
But how do you turn this article into a film?

406
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:59,790
We need to think about equipment budget, and all kinds of risks on set.

407
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:03,150
Let alone the paperwork. Use your head!

408
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:06,270
If you're really that good, you should just do it yourself.

409
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:11,430
I wanted to, but the professor paired us up together.

410
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:13,270
Do you think I want to work with you?

411
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:15,580
Well, you talked shit to the professor.

412
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:19,270
Listen, everyone in the room at that time,

413
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:21,550
they all thought the same as me.

414
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:22,550
And so did you.

415
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:25,710
Nobody dared to say it, but I did.

416
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:28,470
Then, why didn't you just tell him that you didn't want to be with me?

417
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:30,390
Didn't you hear what the professor said?

418
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:31,430
Why didn't you speak up?

419
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:32,950
Why didn't you argue with him?

420
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,390
So, what do we do now?

421
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:45,830
If we can't do it together then we do it separately.

422
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:48,390
Don't you understand what the professor was trying to say?

423
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:51,790
We're just working together to make a documentary.

424
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:53,790
We can do some work separately.

425
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:56,390
Like, we can brainstorm ideas separately

426
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:58,630
and let the professor choose which one he prefers.

427
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:02,670
We divide the tasks and each do our own part.

428
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:04,510
Doing it separately will make us all happy.

429
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,070
Fine. I'm done here.

430
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:07,990
OK.

431
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:09,270
I'm gonna go.

432
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:10,670
Get lost. Go!

433
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:12,590
So annoying.

434
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,870
Hello, Bow.

435
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:23,830
I'm here.

436
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:27,989
Tai, I'm still stuck in traffic, but I'm almost there.

437
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:30,110
Are Noon and Ton there?

438
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,110
I don't see them.

439
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,909
Can you please go in and reserve a table?

440
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:38,590
-Find a table that close to the live band.
-Okay.

441
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:43,510
-And, this time I will not let you get home before it's over.
-Alright.

442
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:12,070
Did you make a reservation?

443
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:13,390
Not yet.

444
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:16,830
Then, feel free to take any seat you like.

445
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:20,310
Can I sit there?

446
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:23,230
Of course. Please sit down.

447
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:31,710
Here's the menu.

448
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,830
Maybe I'll order later.

449
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:35,390
OK.

450
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:36,670
Thank you.

451
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:23,190
Hey bro!

452
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,070
Hey!

453
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:25,790
Hey, Dr. Patts!

454
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:27,310
-How are you?
-Oh, wow.

455
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:29,260
-How are you doing?
-I'm good.

456
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,510
You're trying to make me lose in a dressing-up competition?

457
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:33,150
Well, I just followed your theme.

458
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:35,140
Oh wow, doc.

459
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,150
Happy birthday, Mew.

460
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,870
Thanks.

461
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:39,140
You don't need to buy me a present.

462
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,030
Your arrival makes my day already.

463
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,030
OK. Then I'll just throw it away...

464
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:45,110
Hey, now you bought it, I take it, all right?

465
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:46,750
What's up with you lately?

466
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:48,350
All is good.

467
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:56,350
Just a moment, I think I saw someone I know.

468
00:36:56,350 --> 00:37:00,350
OK, but you surely know a strange one.

469
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:10,470
Are you here alone?

470
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:17,190
If you're not answering, I'll take that as a yes.

471
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:19,590
I'm with friends from work.

472
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:25,270
What are you doing now?

473
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:27,590
Looking at the menu.

474
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,750
Can you read like that?

475
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:35,710
You might've... flipped it.

476
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:55,180
Why did you call me a playboy this afternoon?

477
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,430
You heard that?

478
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:02,910
Hey you! Where are you going?

479
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,420
Do you want me to drive you?

480
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,150
Um, I think you better go first.

481
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,030
I prefer to take the bus.

482
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:18,030
Playboy.

483
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:33,990
Yeah, how come that word occurred?

484
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:43,630
Well, normally you're friendly to everybody. Isn't it the fact?

485
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:46,590
No.

486
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:47,710
Why?

487
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:51,510
You're always friendly to everyone.

488
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:52,790
Always?

489
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:54,550
Me?

490
00:38:57,070 --> 00:39:00,070
Yes. So, I think you are a playboy.

491
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:03,110
I think you might've misunderstood.

492
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:07,470
I am confident that I do not misunderstand a thing.

493
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:20,190
Excuse us, I'm gonna get him back to our table.

494
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:22,110
If you don't mind?

495
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:31,390
Actually, fried chicken joints are very good here.

496
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:32,590
Let's go!

497
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:41,950
Guys, follow me!

498
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:44,310
Whoa!!

499
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,630
You haven't even drunk anything yet, but you're drunk now?

500
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,550
There are a lot of men outside.

501
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:50,630
Been a while.

502
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:51,830
Saengtai!

503
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:54,830
That's awesome! You got a table right by the stage, like super close!

504
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:58,550
Didn't anybody tell you we have a dress code tonight?

505
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:00,150
You don't read in the group chat.

506
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:02,110
Never mind.

507
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,470
Can I sit here?

508
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:07,910
How long have you been waiting here?

509
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:11,550
When you're talking to him, look at his face, not others'.

510
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:14,030
I just arrived.

511
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:15,310
All right.

512
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:17,990
It's been a while since you went out with us.

513
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:21,430
What do you want to eat? Tell us. I'll pay for you.

514
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:25,030
-Oh, so generous!
-Maybe you return my money first?

515
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:27,030
You! Will pay for him only?

516
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:28,750
-What about us?
-Right!

517
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:32,590
OK, I got the whole table, all right?

518
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:34,710
Oh, wow. My Maharani!

519
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,070
-I'll transfer it to you.
-OK.

520
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:38,110
Did you order anything?

521
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:41,470
I thought to wait for you guys first, then I'll order.

522
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:43,270
Let's order some drinks.

523
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:44,630
Let's do it

524
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:45,350
Call them.

525
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:48,150
Hey! Hello!

526
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:48,990
What's wrong with your voice?

527
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:50,190
Do you want some medicine?

528
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:52,870
-Listen to my voice, I have sore throat. 
-Interesting.

529
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,430
Wow, guys.

530
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:55,670
Could you come get our orders please?

531
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:56,070
Yes.

532
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:57,710
Let's order everything!

533
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:00,030
-Maybe the expensive one.
-OK.

534
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,500
No limit now, right?

535
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,670
Saengtai, what do you want?

536
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,030
Whiskey or beer?

537
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:07,310
-Um, I um…
-Come on!

538
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:10,270
Normally, he doesn't drink.

539
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:13,270
But, I brought him today to open his world.

540
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,950
Right.

541
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:18,270
Once in a while, it's no crime.

542
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:20,470
Maybe a little tonight?

543
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:26,990
Just once.

544
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:30,550
Only once.

545
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:31,830
I'll just have a glass of water.

546
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:34,030
Alrighty, water it is!

547
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,350
What about you?

548
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:38,390
What do you want? Go ahead. I want some cocktail.

549
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,590
Cheers!

550
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:50,550
It's great that we don't have to work tomorrow.

551
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:52,070
That's rad.

552
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:53,470
Or we have work tomorrow?

553
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:53,990
Really?

554
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:55,910
Just go to work!

555
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:56,910
Hey, give me some respect.

556
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:58,030
Vacation.

557
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:00,590
I hate that you were like "my job".

558
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:02,590
You pay, right?

559
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:09,190
Woohoo!

560
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,750
Oh wow!

561
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:14,670
Excuse me, everyone.

562
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:17,430
Since today is my birthday,

563
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:22,190
it's my pleasure to welcome all of you to enjoy yourselves here tonight.

564
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:25,110
However, now I would like to invite one of my friends on the stage.

565
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:27,790
He is going to be singing for you guys.

566
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:33,110
Without any further ado, please give him a round of applause.

567
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:35,270
Doctor Patts!!

568
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:45,310
Oh wow, he's handsome.

569
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:47,670
Be cool, Bow!

570
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:49,150
-Me?
-Yes.

571
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:51,580
OK.

572
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:54,710
So cute.

573
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:56,110
Oh!

574
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:58,670
Actually, I'm not a singer.

575
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:01,750
But my friend suddenly called me up.

576
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:04,510
I apologize in advance for any mistakes I'm gonna make.

577
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:05,950
Don't apologize!

578
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:11,310
-Why is he so cute?
-And, he plays the guitar.

579
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:14,030
I think I fell in love!

580
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:31,030
[I am writing a new song and practicing singing it.]

581
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:35,550
Would you mind listening to me?

582
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:46,350
How long have I lived with loneliness?

583
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:49,550
The only thing I hugged was emptiness.

584
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:54,270
I'm always alone every night.

585
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:59,870
Rain is cruel. Rain is pouring.

586
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:03,350
Like it's trying to kill me.

587
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:07,030
Gradually dying off.

588
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:13,790
But I met you at first sight.

589
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:20,830
I suddenly knew, you were the one.

590
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:27,310
The one I've been waiting, the one to be with.

591
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:30,670
The one whose heart matches mine.

592
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:35,070
You're the one. Am I right?

593
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:44,870
If only you use your heart listening to mine,

594
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:52,830
If only you would let me use my heart telling you,

595
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:58,110
That I have only you, that I love you, and that I am yours.

596
00:44:58,110 --> 00:45:04,630
Still waiting for you to listen to my heart.

597
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:09,550
'Cause you are my destiny.

598
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:30,070
That's 100 out of 10.

599
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:33,950
Saengtai, he's so cute, right?

600
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:39,110
Wait! Saengtai! What are you doing?

601
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:40,630
That's my glass!

602
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:42,590
Saengtai!

603
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:48,150
I thought I'd give it a try.

604
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:51,150
-What?
-Saengtai is drunk!

605
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:55,030
All right, he raises up the bar. We need to catch up!

606
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:57,670
Cheers!

607
00:45:57,670 --> 00:45:59,030
Calm down.

608
00:45:59,350 --> 00:46:02,350
Hello, can I get more glasses?

609
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:04,990
So good!

610
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:06,510
Cute!

611
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:13,390
Woah woah!

612
00:46:16,830 --> 00:46:17,510
Heyyy!

613
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:20,380
-Wait girl! Wait!
-It's really fun.

614
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:23,390
Let's go to... No, no, no.

615
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:27,790
-Saengtai?
-Yes, yes, yes?

616
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:29,150
Aren't you coming to the next bar with us?

617
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:31,430
No, I'm not.

618
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:33,070
Such a shame.

619
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:34,270
Can you stay still?

620
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:35,500
Do you need a lift home?

621
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:38,030
No worries, Bow. I got it.

622
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:40,390
I got it, Bow. Please go ahead. Go home.

623
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:40,950
Tai,

624
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:42,990
how do you go back home?

625
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:45,350
There's a taxi!

626
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:47,350
I'm gonna get a taxi!

627
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:48,590
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

628
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:50,630
OK, then straighten up yourself first?

629
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:51,350
Are you gonna be OK?

630
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,030
Text me when you're home.

631
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:54,110
OK?

632
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:55,590
OK. OK.

633
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:56,990
Bow...

634
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:03,190
-Thank you so much!!
-Jesus!!!

635
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:05,990
I'm up here not down there.

636
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:09,470
OK? OK, don't forget to text me when you're home.

637
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:11,950
-Let's go, girls.
-Go!!

638
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:14,670
-I'm gone. Bye!
-Bye bye!

639
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:16,550
Can you stop dancing?

640
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:18,030
God!!

641
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:18,950
Stop it!!

642
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:59,870
How are you getting home? Need a ride?

643
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:05,510
No! I can get home by myself!

644
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:09,350
You always say that.

645
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:13,070
You know what kind of answer it's gonna be.

646
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:34,030
I'm actually worried about you. You're so drunk now.

647
00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:44,550
Here he is, the playboy.

648
00:48:44,870 --> 00:48:46,110
What?

649
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:50,110
Patts, the playboy!!

650
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:53,830
What are you saying? I don't understand.

651
00:48:57,470 --> 00:48:58,950
Woah.

652
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:07,110
If you're seeing someone else, why are you talking to me?

653
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:10,150
What do you mean by "someone else"?

654
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:11,510
I do not even...

655
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:13,110
Ouch!! It hurts!

656
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:58,070
Shit!

657
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:10,870
Wait!

658
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:17,670
Shit!!

659
00:51:04,870 --> 00:51:06,310
What the...!!

660
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:14,110
Patts, I have so many things to tell you.

661
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:16,310
I know what you're about to say.

662
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:18,590
But let's not say it, okay?

663
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:20,980
The assignment that you two submitted...

664
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:22,430
cannot pass.

665
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:24,150
Professor!
