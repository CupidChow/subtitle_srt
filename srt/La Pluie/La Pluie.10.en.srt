[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,270
Saengnuea.

3
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,350
Come on in.

4
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,070
This is Patts. I told you about him.

5
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:26,870
Hello.

6
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:30,230
Did you used to live here?

7
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,110
Yeah, since I was born.

8
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,630
The house next to your house was my grandma's.

9
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:39,870
You are the Kind One.

10
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:31,350
I can't believe that! We used to live so close to each other.

11
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,150
I can't believe that, either.

12
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,630
But I'm glad that you're the Kind One.

13
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,430
Do you mind being my Kind One forever?

14
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,990
I will be anyone you want me to be.

15
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:52,750
Patts.

16
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,590
Yes?

17
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:58,750
Can I sleep over in your room tonight?

18
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,190
Seriously?

19
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:06,990
I just want to stay with you.

20
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,630
OK. Here we go.

21
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,310
It's crazy.

22
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,350
Patts.

23
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:59,070
Can we stay together tonight?

24
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:09,190
Since you're here tonight, I won't hang back.

25
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,390
I am ready.

26
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,910
May I?

27
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:37,150
This is my first time. Don't get me hurt.

28
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,909
Are you sleepy?

29
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:39,510
You can go to bed now. It's gonna be a long night.

30
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,230
Lomfon!

31
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:02,630
Hey, you got a fever.

32
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,350
Never mind.

33
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,990
Just a little rest will fix it.

34
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,870
Are you serious? Look at you.

35
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,350
You should take some pills.

36
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:24,830
Alright?

37
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,430
Here.

38
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:58,790
Come.

39
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,230
Come here.

40
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,510
You must take care of your health.

41
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,790
You were like this when we were in the camp.

42
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:47,950
OK.

43
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,950
I'll go find something to eat.

44
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:08,350
Can you stay here with me?

45
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,710
Sure.

46
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,510
Tien.

47
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:33,550
Can I ask you something?

48
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:42,670
If you had to choose between the one you like and your soul mate,

49
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,310
who would you choose?

50
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,470
Why do you ask that?

51
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,270
I thought you didn't believe in soul mates.

52
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,870
Just tell me your choice.

53
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,870
I don't know why you ask.

54
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:04,590
But if I were to answer honestly,

55
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,910
I would choose my soul mate.

56
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:11,750
Because I've already believed in soul mates.

57
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:24,150
But if I really have hearing loss and I have to choose between the one I like

58
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,350
and my soul mate...

59
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,390
It's hard.

60
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:39,870
Maybe I'll see when it really comes to that.

61
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,590
Don't overthink this.

62
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,710
Sleep and get some rest.

63
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,710
OK.

64
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,670
[Lomfon]

65
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,030
Hi, Lomfon?

66
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:59,350
Do you remember what you promised me?

67
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,430
You said you would treat me to a meal.

68
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,590
Thank you for taking care of Tien.

69
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:11,830
If you need me to do something in the future, just let me know.

70
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,750
Take me for a meal, then?

71
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,830
Yes, I remember.

72
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:28,630
Will you be free this Sunday?

73
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,790
I'd like to have a dinner with you.

74
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,470
Maybe if you got the whole day available?

75
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,750
Yes, I can. I will be free.

76
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:48,390
OK. See you on Sunday.

77
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,230
See you.

78
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:07,070
It's fascinating to discover someone who shares my passions. Just like you, don't you think?

79
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,430
Seriously.

80
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,870
With his gaze and words,

81
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,430
Lomfon definitely likes you!

82
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:30,870
Thank you.

83
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:37,550
Tai, are you sure that you won't sleep over at my place?

84
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,270
Come on.

85
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,750
I'm afraid we won't be able to sleep if I go.

86
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,710
And, I got work to do.

87
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,910
Do you feel better?

88
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:05,390
One more kiss. I'm not satisfied yet.

89
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:15,950
Well, fine.

90
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,589
OK.

91
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,869
Such a baby.

92
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:27,869
I'll be available this Sunday by the way. Wanna hang out?

93
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,340
I'm afraid that I can't.

94
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:35,030
I need to draft a new article for the coming week.

95
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,350
So, I can't.

96
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:47,510
OK. But your next Sunday is mine.

97
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,070
I promise.

98
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:58,430
Don't work too hard. Keep yourself rested.

99
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:59,910
I'll wait for you...

100
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,670
in my dream.

101
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,470
What's wrong with you?

102
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,830
I want to see you every night.

103
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,150
I got to go!

104
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:13,750
Text me when you arrive.

105
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:14,910
OK.

106
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:16,430
Bye bye.

107
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,510
Haven't you ever been to this restaurant?

108
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,830
No. I always stay at home.

109
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:51,070
But I walk past it every day. Can you believe it?

110
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,630
But I never went there.

111
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:55,110
I should go there more often.

112
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:56,750
Tai.

113
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:02,190
I have something to talk to you today actually.

114
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:06,430
But maybe not now.

115
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:10,430
I want to prove something first.

116
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,830
Nice view over there.

117
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:22,430
Do you want to take a photo? I'll take it for you.

118
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,550
Sure.

119
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,190
Where? Here?

120
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:30,150
Yes.

121
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,470
Can I see that?

122
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:02,870
Wow. You took a good shot.

123
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:05,030
Because the model is handsome.

124
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:07,550
Aren't you sweet?

125
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:16,500
You want to take one shot too? I can take a photo like that.

126
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,110
Not really. I just like taking photos for others.

127
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:23,710
OK, then. I'll go for more.

128
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:26,350
One more photo.

129
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,830
This is delicious.

130
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:35,790
Hey, look.

131
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,030
What?

132
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:40,550
Is that Saengtai and Lomfon?

133
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,590
I think so.

134
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,630
Why are they doing here, together?

135
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,190
Click!

136
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,870
What are you doing, Fin?

137
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,790
Making sure about something.

138
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,110
Hello.

139
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:23,190
What do you mean about that photo?

140
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,550
Din and I were walking to work.

141
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,870
Then, I spotted "your cat" with Lomfon.

142
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:31,950
Are you two still good?

143
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,190
Patts.

144
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,870
I want to talk to you.

145
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:47,670
When you went to find Saengtai on the hill,

146
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,790
it also rained where I was.

147
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:55,550
Then, suddenly I got a headache.

148
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:58,670
And I got a hearing-loss.

149
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,470
Before I fainted.

150
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:07,110
I heard Saengtai's voice in the silence of the rain.

151
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,910
What do you mean?

152
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,670
It may sound unbelievable.

153
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,300
But I think...

154
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:22,870
I'm Saengtai's soul mate, too.

155
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:29,790
Well, does Tai know this?

156
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:38,070
Lomfon, let me get this straight.

157
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:43,030
I don't know why it happened.

158
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:47,710
But it's not possible for one person having two soul mates.

159
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:51,270
And now, Saengtai is my boyfriend.

160
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:57,990
Do not get yourself involved with him.

161
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:16,390
I'll be available this Sunday by the way. Wanna hang out?

162
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:19,390
I'm afraid that I can't.

163
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:23,750
I need to draft a new article for the coming week.

164
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:24,470
So, I can't.

165
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:48,110
Lomfon, if you'll excuse me for a sec?

166
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,790
Yes, Patts?

167
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,910
Are you working?

168
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,790
Yes, I am.

169
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,060
[What's up?]

170
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:13,990
Nothing. I just miss you.

171
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,590
I want to hear your voice.

172
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:17,460
I miss you, too.

173
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:21,270
[I'll get back to my work, OK?]

174
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,990
[OK. Have fun.]

175
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:52,270
Tai, are you working?

176
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:57,310
Saengtai, are you in there?

177
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,110
Tai.

178
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:04,790
Can I help you, Patts?

179
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,870
Is Saengtai not here?

180
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:16,630
No. But normally, he is.

181
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,870
He's gone out since this morning.

182
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:20,790
I've been waiting for him too.

183
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:27,430
What's going on?

184
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:32,390
He should have gone to the park with your friend.

185
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,470
My friend?

186
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,230
Lomfon.

187
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:39,630
Huh? Tai and Lomfon?

188
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:44,310
My friends spotted them in the park.

189
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:47,790
I called him. But he said he was working.

190
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:53,270
I wanted to prove. I wanted to believe what Tai said.

191
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:55,550
So, I came here for him.

192
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,190
Patts!

193
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:17,150
Tai, can I get you some drink?

194
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:20,630
That would be nice.

195
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:22,870
I'll go and get some.

196
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,910
You sit here and wait me for a while.

197
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:26,470
OK.

198
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:36,940
A cup of soda, please.

199
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,150
Here.

200
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:50,550
Thank you.

201
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:00,830
Lomfon.

202
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:02,710
Yeah?

203
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:10,150
You said that you want to talk, and you want to prove something. What is that?

204
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:16,510
I don't know. I don't know whether I should tell you.

205
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:23,630
I don't know if I'd get an answer for what I want to prove.

206
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:28,510
Sorry.

207
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,110
It's okay.

208
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:36,590
I don't know what you're thinking about.

209
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,990
But if you can't find an answer yet, don't push yourself.

210
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:44,710
Okay.

211
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:59,110
It's going to rain.

212
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:00,910
Shall we go home?

213
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:04,950
Yes. I can give you a ride.

214
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:10,630
When it rains, I have the hearing loss. I don't want to make you trouble.

215
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:12,350
No problem.

216
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,830
Where did you get that keychain?

217
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:38,670
Have you seen it before?

218
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:43,990
Can I have a look?

219
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:04,470
I'm not sure now. I used to have that kind of keychain with my key to my house.

220
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:06,230
Then, I can't find it.

221
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:16,110
Did you save a kid who almost got hit by a car two years ago?

222
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,070
[Dad!]

223
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,470
[Dad! Wait!]

224
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,470
[Wait for me!]

225
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,190
Hey, you!

226
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:06,950
[Careful!]

227
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:09,990
[It's dangerous!]

228
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:18,430
Wait!

229
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:39,190
I haven't said thank you.

230
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:03,550
[It's raining now. I got to go.]

231
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,110
[Tai!]

232
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:36,870
Did you call me?

233
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,270
Yes.

234
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:43,350
I am your soul mate, too.

235
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,910
What are you saying?

236
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,830
And, you are also my first love.

237
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:36,750
Tai, I'm sorry.

238
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:42,230
I told you to stay away from my boyfriend!

239
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:44,190
Patts!

240
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:47,190
Saengtai's my boyfriend!

241
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,990
Patts! Enough! Enough now!

242
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:51,230
Stop!

243
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:56,870
Why on earth did you kiss my boyfriend!

244
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:57,830
Huh?

245
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:01,870
You know I'm his soul mate. Don't you?

246
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:04,430
-You shut up! -Stop!

247
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:05,750
Patts! Stop!

248
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,590
-I'm Seangtai's soul mate! -Stop!

249
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:10,870
That's me!

250
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:12,430
You remember that!

251
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:13,470
Enough!

252
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,660
Stop now!

253
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:20,150
This fucking destiny, I don't want it anymore!

254
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:53,990
Tai!

255
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,070
Tai!

256
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:58,990
Tai!

257
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:00,750
Tai!

258
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:02,150
Please talk to me.

259
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:04,590
Tai!

260
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:06,430
I tell you to talk to me.

261
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:07,510
It hurts.

262
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:09,989
I'm sorry.

263
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:14,429
I don't know what the hell is happening with our soulmate thing.

264
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:17,230
And, I don't really care.

265
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:20,429
I just want to hear it from you.

266
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:25,190
Lomfon kissed you first, right?

267
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:29,179
Answer me. Me and him,

268
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:30,830
who do you choose?

269
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:36,190
Patts, I can't understand what are you asking.

270
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:37,270
No, you can.

271
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:41,230
This question is in my head.

272
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,830
Always in my head!

273
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:45,070
Do I have to choose?

274
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:47,710
You have already know that I love you so much.

275
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,310
Then, why did you lie to me today? Huh?

276
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,989
Why did you lie to me today?

277
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:53,989
I'm sorry!

278
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:55,860
OK?

279
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,670
I don't want you to think too much.

280
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:01,510
See? What you did,

281
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:03,470
what you said... Look at you!

282
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:05,870
Do you believe in our relationship?

283
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:09,940
I do. I always do.

284
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,710
But now, it's you who are imagining things.

285
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:16,660
Look at me! Who do you choose?

286
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:21,270
I think you should go home.

287
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:25,670
This is not Patts whom I want to talk to.

288
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:29,190
It's not that hard, Tai.

289
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:33,630
It’s not that hard to answer me that you choose me.

290
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:36,430
Or you choose him?

291
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:44,550
Now that it comes down to this, are you going to say nothing?

292
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:49,830
Whatever I'm going to say, you won't understand.

293
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:53,550
But how can I try to understand you if you don't say anything?

294
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,350
Patts.

295
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:57,470
I beg you.

296
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,390
Go home now.

297
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:05,830
I'm afraid if I say something now,

298
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:08,510
it will make it worse.

299
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:10,950
Say it! Say that you choose me!

300
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:13,550
I'm sorry, Patts.

301
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:19,950
Fuck!

302
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:24,950
Is it that hard choosing me?

303
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:47,350
What did you mean?

304
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:50,550
What did you mean just now?

305
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:53,710
Just like I said.

306
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:57,670
I can hear Tai's voice when it rains.

307
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:00,910
It started to happen when we were in the camp.

308
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:02,470
You liar.

309
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:05,990
I'm speaking now and you can hear me.

310
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:08,150
Why did I lie to you?

311
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,830
I just happen to hear now.

312
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:15,270
So do Patts and Seangtai.

313
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:17,430
Is that even possible?

314
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:21,630
You're saying that my brother has two soul mates?

315
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,150
Are you insane?

316
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,190
I don't know!

317
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,390
You don't know!

318
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,830
You say it now. You don't know!

319
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:31,030
Screw you.

320
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,150
I'm sorry.

321
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:37,670
I had told you leave my brother alone.

322
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,830
I just wanted to prove something.

323
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:42,750
Prove what?

324
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:44,670
Huh?

325
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:49,430
Proving that Patts and my brother don't deserve to be together?

326
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,110
Shame of you!

327
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:56,390
You're a jerk!

328
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:00,470
Do you know how hurt I am now

329
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:04,070
and you still say that to me?

330
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:07,630
I want to know my heart.

331
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:10,110
I want to know who I like.

332
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:13,750
What does it have to do with you?

333
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:17,510
Because I like you.

334
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:23,190
Because I like you, asshole.

335
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:27,750
I thought that you have the same feeling.

336
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:39,430
But, it is not.

337
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,190
Duer, that's strange.

338
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:22,630
I wanted to heal my hearing loss.

339
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:40,590
Now here I am, but I don't feel better.

340
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:45,270
Do I have to choose someone?

341
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:47,860
You already know that I love you so much!

342
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:16,470
When can I get through this?

343
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:18,470
Patts, stop drinking. That's too much.

344
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:40,350
Because I like you.

345
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:44,190
Because I like you, asshole.

346
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,790
I thought that you have the same feeling.

347
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:20,150
You're a jerk.

348
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:23,510
Do you know how hurt I am now

349
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:26,870
and you still say that to me?

350
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:30,870
I just want to know my heart.

351
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:32,470
I want to know who I like.

352
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:56,070
Tai, are you in there?

353
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:57,830
Open the door.

354
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:00,270
Tai. Open the door.

355
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:06,150
Are you drunk?

356
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:10,550
I drank a bit.

357
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:12,470
But, I'm not drunk.

358
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:17,870
I want to talk.

359
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:22,150
Are you sure that you can talk now?

360
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:25,870
I'm more calm now.

361
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:27,710
But, I'm not feeling well

362
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:32,150
that our thing is not finished.

363
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:34,590
Understood.

364
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:40,150
If you insist, go ahead.

365
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:50,590
I'm sorry.

366
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:57,550
I'm sorry if what I said made you look down on our relationship.

367
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:00,630
I'm just confused.

368
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:02,510
I just can't understand.

369
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:06,870
Why is our hearing loss gone all of the sudden?

370
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:12,190
It's like the soul-mate stuff is gone, too.

371
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:20,830
I don't know if it's science,

372
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:24,750
or that fucking destiny, or whatever it is.

373
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:29,190
But everything happened after you shouted.

374
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:31,750
You still love me, do you?

375
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:41,430
This is exactly why I don't want to talk to you.

376
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:43,870
Then, when will we talk if not now?

377
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:51,350
It's torturing me not knowing what you're thinking.

378
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:53,230
What do you want me to say?

379
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:56,550
I just want your attitude.

380
00:44:56,910 --> 00:44:58,790
Whether you choose me or not,

381
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:00,270
I can accept it.

382
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:05,390
But the only thing I can't bear with is your silence.

383
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:10,110
If you don't understand my silence,

384
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:13,870
you won't understand any of my words.

385
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:17,510
Fuck this!

386
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:22,990
Are you serious? Just tell me.

387
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:24,830
Is it that difficult?

388
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:26,310
We should break up

389
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,190
if you are like this.

390
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:32,910
Like what?

391
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:36,030
I have to be like what to make you love me?

392
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:38,510
I don't fucking know what to do now!

393
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:40,230
Do I have to be like Lomfon?

394
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:41,310
Don't you say that to me.

395
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:43,950
Say what? I can't even say that to you?

396
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:46,350
I feel that we can't figure it out now.

397
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:52,870
Alright. You said it.

398
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:57,150
Let's break up.

399
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:05,230
Tai.

400
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:07,390
Thank you, Patts.

401
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:08,470
It's...

402
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:14,670
I have been happy during this period.

403
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:17,150
You should go.

404
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:17,790
Tai.

405
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:19,950
Tai. Tai.

406
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:21,310
Tai. I'm sorry.

407
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:21,990
Tai.

408
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:24,390
Tai. Tai. Tai.

409
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:25,590
I'm so sorry.

410
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:26,910
Tai.

411
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:30,190
Tai. I'm sorry. I'm drunk.

412
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:33,470
Tai.

413
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:38,550
Tai.

414
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:44,710
Tai. Open the door, please.

415
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:06,470
Tai.

416
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:14,390
Tai.

417
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:20,190
Tai. Open the door, please.

418
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:47,270
♫ Just try to use your heart listening to mine.♫

419
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:55,220
♫ Just allow me to use my heart and tell you♫

420
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:58,710
♫ That there's only you, and I keep saying I love you.♫

421
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:01,350
♫ And my heart only belongs to you.♫

422
00:48:01,350 --> 00:48:06,990
♫ I'm still waiting for you to listen to my heart.♫

423
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:10,390
♫ Cause you're my destiny.♫

424
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:13,790
Let me emphasize again.

425
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:17,630
The keyword is "The Message from Heart".

426
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:19,710
Can I join you?

427
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:22,030
I don't want to be in a group with that freak.

428
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:25,030
Don't you feel anything?

429
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:29,510
Dad celebrates mom, as if mom is newlywed.

430
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:32,870
How are you, my boys?

431
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:34,670
You're more handsome than that man.

432
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:37,350
Oh, no. Today is your mother's big day.
