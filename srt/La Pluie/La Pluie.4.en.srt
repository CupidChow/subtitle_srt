1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,830
Wait a moment, I think I know that guy.

3
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:22,710
Are you here alone?

4
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,710
How do you know it's my brother's work?

5
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:25,620
Well...

6
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,790
Wait! Saengtai! That's my glass!

7
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:30,790
You already have someone else. Why do you come and talk to me?

8
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:31,790
I do not even...

9
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,710
Ouch! It hurts!

10
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,150
Holy crap!

11
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,870
Is this really Patts' home?

12
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:52,190
[I'll catch you up on everything you suspect.]

13
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:56,870
[Last night, I didn't know where you live.]

14
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,870
[I tried to ask you, but you were really drunk.]

15
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,790
[So, I brought you to my place.]

16
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,870
(mumbling) My place...

17
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:10,390
[You got changed by yourself.]

18
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,430
[I just gave the clothes to you.]

19
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,310
[Then, you slept on the bed,

20
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,150
and I slept on the sofa.]

21
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,950
[We had no physical contact.]

22
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:30,070
[Except... I helped you when you were drunk.]

23
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:31,750
[And....

24
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:35,630
when you bit me. I swear.]

25
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:41,950
Hold on, why did he cross "I swear"?

26
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,110
[And, you kept saying,

27
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,590
"Don't go! Don't go! Don't go!"]

28
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,030
(mumbling) Don't go?

29
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,510
Patts, you playboy!

30
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:02,150
What are you talking about?

31
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,830
Ouch! It hurts!

32
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,070
Easy there.

33
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,870
Hey, you.

34
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,070
Saengtai.

35
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,670
Are you alright?

36
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:33,870
Let me go.

37
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:37,510
Why are you like this, Patts?

38
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,750
Why are you so cute like this when you are drunk?

39
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,230
Huh?

40
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,190
Wait for me here.

41
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,950
I'll grab my car.

42
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,310
Okay?

43
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,230
No. Don't go!

44
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,030
Patts, stay.

45
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:22,590
If you go, I will never forgive you.

46
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,110
Okay.

47
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,950
Then, let's go together.

48
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:40,390
Oh… oh man!

49
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,230
[Last night, you puked yourself.]

50
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:50,870
[I got your clothes washed and hung them on the balcony.]

51
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:56,100
[If you wake up and they are still wet, you can wear mine and leave.]

52
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,870
[Sorry, I have to go this morning.]

53
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:04,590
[I got an early case. I'm so sorry

54
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,550
leaving you alone.]

55
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:10,380
[But, I wrote this note, hoping to calm you down when you wake up.]

56
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,900
[I don't know if you remember about last night.]

57
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:23,550
[PS Last night I told you something

58
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,110
but I'm afraid you don't remember.]

59
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,350
[I'm not two-timing someone.]

60
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,390
[I'm not seeing a lot of people.]

61
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,310
[You might not believe me now.]

62
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:36,750
[But, I promise I didn't lie to you.]

63
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:41,190
[Could you give me a chance to know you more?]

64
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,990
Um...

65
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,670
What the hell!

66
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:49,710
Jeez!

67
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,430
You need to finish your homework as soon as possible and hand it to me.

68
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,070
Class dismissed.

69
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,430
(together) Thank you.

70
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,030
Let's go to play games today.

71
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:21,990
Cool.

72
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:22,830
Let's go.

73
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,910
See you.

74
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,390
Hey, Saengtien, Lomfon,

75
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,630
can I talk to you for a while?

76
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:32,950
Okay.

77
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:39,150
Your project didn't pass.

78
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,630
But for what, professor?

79
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,030
You didn't work it together.

80
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,230
Huh?

81
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,550
You two are working on your own project separately, aren't you?

82
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,270
Yes.

83
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,550
What's wrong with that?

84
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,950
I thought you got what I said in the first class.

85
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,550
I wanted you to work together.

86
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,830
I'm sorry, why don't you comment on our projects

87
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:04,230
instead of criticizing us for not cooperating?

88
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,230
Tien,

89
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:12,870
that's because you haven't learned how to work according the process like making a movie.

90
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:17,310
If I owned a big studio and wanted to invest in your movie,

91
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,350
but you two presented such divergent ideas,

92
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:25,030
do you still think you can get my money?

93
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:29,230
But I'm not working with a studio.

94
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:32,429
Not even my partner was my choice.

95
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:36,429
What do you think you can achieve if you continue like this?

96
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:40,110
Your project cannot pass. Go back and redo it.

97
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,590
Professor!

98
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:44,190
Please! I don't want to redo it.

99
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,710
Professor!

100
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,310
May.

101
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,310
Has the last patient arrived?

102
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,510
Not yet, but almost here.

103
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,230
Patts..

104
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:47,750
Nara...

105
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:55,230
What a coincidence. I can't believe I'd see you here.

106
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:00,830
I thought Fluke and Ruj work here,

107
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,510
So I brought Baby.

108
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:09,070
Yeah. Dream, Din and Fin also work here.

109
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:12,070
Really? Great.

110
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,750
Come here. You are not feeling well?

111
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:16,310
It got ticks.

112
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:23,030
I haven't seen you for a while. You got chubbier, huh?

113
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,030
How long has it had ticks?

114
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,510
Two to three days.

115
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,630
I walked it in a park.

116
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,470
It might get ticks from there.

117
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:40,790
May, could your please prepare the examination room?

118
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:41,910
Sure.

119
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,430
Patts...

120
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,070
I know what you're going to say.

121
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,790
But we'd better not talk about that.

122
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,150
I just want to say.

123
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:15,510
That night made me more determined about my feelings,

124
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,310
but I wasn't so sure earlier.

125
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,670
After we broke up,

126
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,950
I got the time to calm down and re-examine our relationship.

127
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:38,340
I have a lot to say to you.

128
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,670
I want to say I'm sorry.

129
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:48,870
But, I don't know how to start.

130
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,990
I want to say that...

131
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,070
Patts,

132
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,670
the examination room's ready.

133
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,550
Thank you. I'll be right there.

134
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,510
Patts.

135
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,550
I wish we can get back together.

136
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:35,990
Nara.

137
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,910
I think we should break up, Patts.

138
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,270
No need to resist it.

139
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,710
Let me go.

140
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:57,470
Can you calm down first?

141
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:01,030
You know I was born with this disease.

142
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:05,470
Can you stop using this as an excuse?

143
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:11,550
You said so every time I felt less important to you.

144
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,870
I know you have hearing loss.

145
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:26,870
And, I know you always wait to hear from your soul mate.

146
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:32,150
But let me ask you. Did he ever answered?

147
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,510
But you also know

148
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:41,390
that I don't have any feelings toward my soul mate.

149
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:47,110
I want to talk to him because he's like me.

150
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,830
He's the only one that can talk with me when it rains.

151
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,870
He's the only one who hears me.

152
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:01,470
You always say that you're lonely on rainy days.

153
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:09,550
But you see, I'm always here for you.

154
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,390
I tried to change myself to cater you.

155
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,150
I tried to help you.

156
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:22,590
Did that have to make me this undeserving?

157
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:30,390
Every time it rains, I feel the rain dissolves our relationship.

158
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:33,110
I didn't think things would turn out like this.

159
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,910
But, that's exactly what I feel.

160
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:38,870
If there were a cure for this damned disease, I'd already managed to get it.

161
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:43,670
I swear, you are always important to me.

162
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:47,430
What do you want me to do?

163
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:50,670
I want you to think about my feelings.

164
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,430
Can you do that?

165
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,430
I'm sorry.

166
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,110
I'll try my best.

167
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:02,310
I'll try harder.

168
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:05,310
Please tell me what to do.

169
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:06,790
I can do anything.

170
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,950
Can you not leave me?

171
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,670
Just tell me what can I do.

172
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,830
When it rained,

173
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:23,140
can you promise me you won't talk to your soul mate.

174
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,750
I think we're done.

175
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,150
I'm exhausted.

176
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,910
So exhausted.

177
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,270
I'm sorry, Patts.

178
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:10,070
I don't want to get hurt anymore.

179
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:17,070
I'll let you go on your way.

180
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:24,070
I think I can live without you.

181
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,590
It's going to rain, Patts.

182
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,390
Nara.

183
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,150
Well, let me take it in there.

184
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,270
Woohoo! One more time!

185
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,310
Wit, Jessada.

186
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,340
Has your documentary project get passed?

187
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,550
Of course.

188
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,270
We do that together.

189
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:48,590
My presenting skill can get 99 points.

190
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:52,030
And Jackass's boasting skill can get 100.

191
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:54,070
Shouldn't we pass?

192
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,630
The professor asked me to rework.

193
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,270
He said my project's too simple.

194
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,110
Come here.

195
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:03,110
You know he likes something…

196
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:05,230
like deep, deeper, deepest.

197
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,700
So, you should find something deep!

198
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:11,830
Then, brag about it until you make it.

199
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,150
Okay.

200
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,470
Tien, what about you?

201
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,550
He must get passed.

202
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,070
He's got Lomfon.

203
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,030
I don't think so.

204
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,510
How about this? Let's make a bet.

205
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,550
Say 10 baht.

206
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:38,030
Come on.

207
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,990
Look at his face. He already knew.

208
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,630
Tien.

209
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:49,630
Guys, I want to hold your hands.

210
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,070
Are you nuts?

211
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,550
What's wrong with you?

212
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,470
Tong, come here.

213
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,670
Oh wow.

214
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,270
What's happening?

215
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,710
Nope.

216
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:06,510
Wit.

217
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:08,310
Are you trying to curse me?

218
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,230
Woah!

219
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,590
Nope.

220
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,270
Do you want to hold mine?

221
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,630
Nam.

222
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:25,990
Come here.

223
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:30,790
Give me your hands.

224
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,510
What?

225
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:32,910
Come on now.

226
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,710
Where's the beating?

227
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,630
Can I get my hands back?

228
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,390
What's wrong with him?

229
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:28,030
Nara was here?

230
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,140
How did you know?

231
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,150
Your assistant.

232
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:38,070
She told me your ex took a dog here.

233
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,870
News travels fast.

234
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,630
What did you talk about?

235
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:53,070
She said she wanted me to be back together with her.

236
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,670
What did you say?

237
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,030
Nothing.

238
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,190
I didn't know what to say.

239
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:13,470
I know myself. I know exactly what I want.

240
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,950
It's good you're clear with yourself.

241
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,630
Besides,

242
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:31,990
suppose that I don't like Saengtai now,

243
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:36,350
I came back to Nara, it would end up just as the same.

244
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,710
She cannot endure my disease.

245
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:47,620
I don't want to go back and let us hurt each other.

246
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:55,510
I understand.

247
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:00,390
I also understand her.

248
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:06,030
The reason she said that might be because of that night...

249
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:12,870
Ah, certainly...

250
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,350
Does it end now then?

251
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:21,910
I don't know.

252
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:26,110
It ends for me.

253
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:30,630
For her, I don't know.

254
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:42,190
Not answering her today,

255
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,070
might be the best answer for her.

256
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:51,310
Hope she's on the same page with you.

257
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,710
If not, it will be bad.

258
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,550
Hope it doesn't get there.

259
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,270
Let's go to have dinner.

260
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,750
Yeah.

261
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,630
Tom Yum noodles?

262
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,310
Made of the auntie over there?

263
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:22,150
Reach there last, pay first!

264
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:28,750
If I opened the door first...

265
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,470
-Enough of you. -Here, you lose.

266
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:34,030
-Enough. I'm tired. -Just kidding.

267
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:37,990
How can I not invite my friend to dinner?

268
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:50,590
Oh! I forgot I needed to eat with my mom.

269
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:54,070
I'm off to my mom then.

270
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,270
Next time, maybe?

271
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,820
-Sure. -Okay.

272
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,710
Okay.

273
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,430
Safe trip home.

274
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:01,070
Bye bye.

275
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,270
Are you here for me?

276
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,950
Yes.

277
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,030
Why didn't you call?

278
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,790
What if I'm gone?

279
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:29,870
I'll call you then.

280
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:36,590
You are totally different from last night now, aren't you?

281
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:40,100
Can we just leave it alone?

282
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:43,310
Alright. I'll stop.

283
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:48,030
What can I do for you?

284
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:57,150
Here, this is your shirt.

285
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,670
I washed it.

286
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:06,630
Thanks for taking care of me last night.

287
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,630
And sorry for disturbing you.

288
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:13,790
No, it's my pleasure.

289
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:20,430
You read my note, didn't you?

290
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,550
So can you tell me your answer?

291
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,510
[I'm not two-timing someone.]

292
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,670
[I'm not seeing a lot of people.]

293
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:35,830
[You might not believe me now.]

294
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:38,830
[But, I promise I didn't lie to you.]

295
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:43,070
[Could you give me a chance to know you more?]

296
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:58,510
I just don't know why you want to know me more.

297
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:04,590
If you know me, you might be bored with me.

298
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:11,550
But if you don't mind, I...

299
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:14,590
I...

300
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:26,110
Let's go to have dinner.

301
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:33,630
Okay.

302
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:36,110
I know many good restaurants.

303
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,590
Yes.

304
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,790
Take my car?

305
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,950
Lead the way.

306
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:59,470
Okay.

307
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,710
Welcome, Mr. Patts.

308
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:56,540
Alin has informed that you and your special guest will come.

309
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:01,470
Here is the menu for today.

310
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:04,070
I'll come back to take your orders.

311
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:05,550
Thank you.

312
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,710
What would you like to have?

313
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:31,390
Um...

314
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:41,030
I can eat anything. Your order would be fine.

315
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,470
I'm okay.

316
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:46,070
There's no "anything".

317
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:56,230
Well, I order and you eat it like you said, okay?

318
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,750
Please give us the Chef's Recommendation.

319
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:12,870
The food will be out in a moment.

320
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:15,550
You know what, now you're like a shaved cat.

321
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:18,470
Yes?

322
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:21,390
A shaved cat?

323
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:22,870
What do you mean?

324
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:28,590
A shaved cat will become disoriented.

325
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,790
So it will bump into everything around.

326
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,670
Just like you now.

327
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:37,590
Really? I didn't know that.

328
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:41,190
Most people don't.

329
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:46,350
They believe shaving a cat can make it stay at home.

330
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,230
Actually, it's partly correct.

331
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:52,230
But in fact, the cat stays at home,

332
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:55,230
because it feels insecure.

333
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:04,580
Well, I think I'm a shaved cat.

334
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:12,070
Actually, I don't go out

335
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,820
if it is not necessary.

336
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:21,350
But I can be your whisker.

337
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:24,350
Excuse me?

338
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:28,110
I can be the missing part of yours.

339
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:33,470
Sorry. Have some water.

340
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,430
I'll stop that.

341
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:44,270
Are you always like this?

342
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,270
Yes.

343
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:51,310
But not to everyone.

344
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,510
Patts.

345
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:09,550
Do you usually eat this fancy food?

346
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:14,670
Actually, you didn't have to take me here like this.

347
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:21,390
Honestly, these cost me half a month's salary.

348
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:24,990
Really?

349
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:29,350
I'm joking.

350
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:31,310
Not that much.

351
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:34,910
See? You said no joking anymore!

352
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:46,630
I wanted to know what do you like.

353
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:49,670
So, we can find our common interests.

354
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:56,310
And, it's not up to where we eat,

355
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:58,630
or what we eat.

356
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:02,590
It's up to whom I eat with.

357
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:09,230
Go ahead. Eat up.

358
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:31,150
Okay.

359
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,830
Thank you, Patts.

360
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,390
My pleasure.

361
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:53,790
I think it's going to rain.

362
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:55,630
Go back home, okay?

363
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:56,950
Otherwise, you'll be wet.

364
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,270
Okay.

365
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:02,230
I got to go.

366
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:06,070
Saengtai.

367
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:12,710
Oh.

368
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:28,230
Be more carefully next time.

369
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:38,110
If you'll excuse me.

370
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:58,670
Let's go to have dinner.

371
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:06,060
But I can be your whisker.

372
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:11,270
I can be the missing part of yours.

373
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:13,870
I'm sorry.

374
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,790
Be more careful next time.

375
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:06,390
[I'm traditional, I like flowers and dates.]

376
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:12,110
Did you get into your room?

377
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:20,670
Patts

378
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:25,950
You...

379
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,750
You know that I...

380
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,950
I know that you are my soul mate.

381
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,630
How?

382
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,270
You don't remember?

383
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:52,870
Remember what? I have no idea.

384
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:00,230
Shall I tell you?

385
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:04,510
But can I not tell you everything?

386
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:11,510
Tell me all about it.

387
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:20,190
I knew this because of last night.

388
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,150
Okay wait.

389
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,150
Saengtai.

390
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:47,790
I'll get you on the sofa, okay?

391
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:48,670
OK.

392
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:18,830
You are not going to sleep?

393
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,660
We haven't made it clear yet.

394
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:23,630
About what?

395
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:25,590
About how you're seeing others.

396
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:29,070
So, where did you here that?

397
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:30,430
I hate it!

398
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:32,790
I hate playboys!

399
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:36,550
I hate you because you're a playboy!

400
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:39,190
Hate you! Hate you! Hate you!

401
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:43,300
I think you should go to sleep.

402
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:06,310
You are so good at waiting.

403
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:12,550
You are so patient.

404
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,790
You have talked to me for 2 years,

405
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:30,870
but I haven't replied even once.

406
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:49,790
Saengtai?

407
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:54,430
Are you listening?

408
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:56,830
Yes.

409
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:02,470
Actually, I have something to tell you.

410
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:06,630
Is there something you want to tell me?

411
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:15,950
Do you remember I said that I wanted to defy my destiny?

412
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:20,310
The person who made me want to do that...

413
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:23,190
is you.

414
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:32,550
You know what I mean, right?

415
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:41,350
From now on, no matter what will happen,

416
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:45,030
I promise

417
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:49,550
I won't let you go.

418
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:01,350
It's nice to meet you as well,

419
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:02,670
Patts.

420
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:18,630
Is it all you want to tell me?

421
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:22,270
Yeah. That's pretty much it.

422
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:25,790
You were so drunk then,

423
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:29,670
so I gave you my clothes.

424
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:31,110
After you changed,

425
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:34,630
you went out of the bathroom and straight to bed.

426
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:42,190
Well, where are you now?

427
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:44,110
I'm still around here.

428
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:47,630
But I'll be off soon.

429
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:51,070
It looks like the rain is about to stop.

430
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:57,670
Have a safe drive home.

431
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:02,550
Yes,

432
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:06,670
soul mate.

433
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:13,110
Okay.

434
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:12,790
You are so good at waiting.

435
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:15,230
You are so patient.

436
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:22,550
You have talked to me for 2 years,

437
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:32,870
but I haven't replied even once.

438
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:41,870
Thank you for always being patient with me.

439
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:53,820
You are really the one that I thought.

440
00:44:55,830 --> 00:45:01,630
♫But I met you at first sight.♫

441
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:08,740
I suddenly knew, you were the one.

442
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:15,150
The one I've been waiting, the one to be with.

443
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:18,550
The one whose hart matches mine.

444
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:22,910
Is the one you, please?

445
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:31,030
If only you use your heart listening to mine,

446
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:38,870
♫If only you would let me use my heart telling you,♫

447
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:48,070
Saengtai...

448
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:36,630
I went to see my soul mate.

449
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:37,390
Oh my god!

450
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:38,870
Saengtai's soul mate

451
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:40,340
is so handsome.

452
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:41,870
This is Lomfon, Saengtien's friend.

453
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:43,150
I think, Lomfon...

454
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:45,870
definitely has some feelings toward you!

455
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:47,390
Bow!
