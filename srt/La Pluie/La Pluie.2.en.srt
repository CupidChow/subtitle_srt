2
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,030
Yesterday, I just responded to the soul mate.

3
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:22,790
What??

4
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,110
Friends like you. No thanks.

5
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,510
What’d you say? Do you want a fight? Huh?

6
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:28,910
Maybe, the name’s Duer.

7
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:30,750
Oh wait. Don’t take it home, please.

8
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:36,030
Why do I want to talk to him now though I haven’t answered him for 2 years?

00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,910
[Phat Wetchutianan]

10
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,150
Hey, you!

11
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,780
What’s your name?

12
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,350
What?

13
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:46,510
Phat. My name is Phat.

14
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,070
Um. Just a moment.

15
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,470
Phat...

16
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,990
Are you still there?

17
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:17,829
Yes.

18
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:21,990
Last night, the rain stopped before I finished?

19
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,470
Yes.

20
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:29,990
Well, I think I'll defy my destiny.

21
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:32,350
Come again?

22
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:36,820
I think I might have found "the one".

23
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,430
I know it's none of your business.

24
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:45,190
Having been talking with you for 2 years might have annoyed you enough.

25
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:51,350
But... thanks a lot for listening.

26
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:55,790
OK.

27
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,190
Hungry now, Duer?

28
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:28,790
Hey, I got you some snacks.

29
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,750
Want some?

30
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:42,710
I think I might have found "the one".

31
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:51,030
So, this is what it's called heart-broken.

32
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,430
Dad.

33
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,310
Dad.

34
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,230
Dad! Dad!

35
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,550
Can you not go?

36
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,630
How are we going to live without you?

37
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,270
No. Please don't go.

38
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:00,150
When you miss me, you just come visit me.

39
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,830
Then, we can go out together.

40
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,590
But I want to stay with you every day.

41
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,270
Chan.

42
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,510
Chan, Chan.

43
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,470
No! Don't go.

44
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,630
Don't do that.

45
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,510
You're making it hard for Dad.

46
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:23,230
Now that it comes down to this, you're really not going to say a thing?

47
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:31,070
Say something now? You won't even understand.

48
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:34,580
As if not saying something now's going to help?

49
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,550
Good!

50
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:45,270
It's best... that you know nothing.

51
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,070
Dad! Dad!!

52
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,270
Chan, Chan. Don't.

53
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,430
Dad!

54
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:59,909
-Dad!
-Tai!

55
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,550
You called me. What's up?

56
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,950
I'm worried about you.

57
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,590
I found my soul mate!

58
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,909
He said he'd defy his destiny.

59
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:59,909
He said he found "the one".

60
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:08,350
I saw him right here. I remembered his voice.

61
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,470
And, I took a peek at his name.

62
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:18,110
Then, it rained. So, I talked to him.

63
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:21,740
I asked him, then that's when I knew he's my soul mate.

64
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:31,150
I don't think he knows I'm his soul mate.

65
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:34,150
It's the one and only time we met.

66
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:42,669
He's super adorable!

67
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:47,190
Hey!!!

68
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:55,230
You... dragged me out in the middle of the night.

69
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,230
On the rainy day.

70
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:00,270
You know, before I arrived here...

71
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,750
I took a bus, I took a train.

72
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,310
I took a motorbike, in the rain.

73
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:09,150
I am wet and exhausted.

74
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:13,590
In order to learn that you found your soul mate.

75
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,670
And, he's got "the one". Am I right?

76
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:22,150
Now, you say he's cute.

77
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,510
Right?

78
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,150
Just like that?

79
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,990
What have you been doing in the last 2 years? Tai!

80
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,390
Hey, dude, calm down.

81
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:42,070
When he said he's got the one of his own...

82
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,350
I was like...

83
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,710
I'm like...

84
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,510
Saengtai!!!

85
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:52,300
What are you looking at? I'm freaking tired, man!

86
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,790
Listen to me.

87
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:59,750
You already fucked with love, un-! fuck! it!

88
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,670
[Unfuck it]

89
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,710
Don't you forget.

90
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,070
Hey!

91
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:29,670
Tien! Hey! I didn't finish!

92
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,070
Are you okay?

93
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:50,070
Can I help you?

94
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:56,590
"Unfuck it"?

95
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,310
Tien, you little...

96
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:06,310
Um. It is um... the new topic that...

97
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:08,310
I'm about to write.

98
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,790
That sounds weird.

99
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:16,510
Got to go to work very early tomorrow. Please excuse me.

100
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,550
Achoo!!

101
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,630
That little prick!

102
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,220
Yes, Pingpong?

103
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,430
Heyyy, my little bro!

104
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,070
Where are you?

105
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,390
In the university. What's up?

106
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:00,870
Look, I really need your help.

107
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,950
I'm sending you the location. Come, please.

108
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,790
-What's this about?
-Just come!

109
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,910
Don't ask. I'm in trouble. Just come here.

110
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:19,790
My life needs sighing this much!?

111
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,750
You've got to be joking?

112
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,470
I'm serious.

113
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,950
This look suits you.

114
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:48,830
So cool.

115
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:49,750
This look?

116
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:50,670
Yes!

117
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,270
Seriously, what is this about?

118
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,510
Here, read this.

119
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,190
A short film?

120
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,030
Yeah.

121
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,030
Listen to me carefully.

122
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:05,310
The actor that I assigned arrived the set this morning.

123
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:08,310
And, he got a COVID test. He found the 2 lines...

124
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,030
Meaning he got COVID?

125
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:09,710
Meaning, he's pregnant.

126
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,390
Just kidding. He got COVID, yeah.

127
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:16,470
Now, when he got COVID, I was like, hey, I already paid for this set!

128
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,910
I paid for the lights, the cameras.

129
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,670
Do you think I would waste all of it?

130
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:22,470
Do you think I would not give my bro a call?

131
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,070
There's always "my bro" with you.

132
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,270
Just help me out, my bro.

133
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:30,230
Listen, the role you got here is named "Tongfah" (Sky).

134
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:33,590
Tongfah is 17. He quit studying.

135
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:37,590
He started to sing for a living, in various events.

136
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:39,110
In various places.

137
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,590
-He helped his family.
-Uh-huh?

138
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,110
He's quite poor though.

139
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:45,270
And, one day, all these elite kids...

140
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,150
threw a party.

141
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:50,070
They were looking for a dorky country-music singer.

142
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:52,510
"Feels-like-a-bullying" thing, you know?

143
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:54,430
Like, they hired the singer just to bully him.

144
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:55,070
OK...

145
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:59,150
But when Tongfah went there, he saw his friend.

146
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:02,150
A childhood friend named "Gonmek" (Cloud).

147
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,430
So, they like each other?

148
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:09,030
Finally, you met him when you're surrounded by the bullying elite kids. Something like that.

149
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,110
Got it?

150
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,870
Damn... deep script.

151
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,940
Yeah, you can do it.

152
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,310
And, who plays Gonmek?

153
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:18,990
Gonmek...

154
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,030
Hey!

155
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:36,030
I think you know him very well.

156
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,630
So, this is Gonmek?

157
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,390
"Gone-with-acting", maybe?

158
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,670
See? This is just the beginning.

159
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:50,430
I knew it. You guys' chemistry is lit.

160
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:50,990
I love it.

161
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:53,310
I just fought with him, you know.

162
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:57,070
That's the thing. That's why I called you.

163
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,990
Pingpong, I have friends who are very good at acting.

164
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,270
Maybe we should replace this guy?

165
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,030
Replace you, indeed?

166
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:10,790
Guys, don't. You two are actors.

167
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,950
And, "I" am the director.

168
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,270
Where's "the-show-must-go-on" spirit?

169
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,870
Trust me, guys.

170
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:22,030
Just listen closely when I explain the blocking. I've already wated so much time.

171
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,350
Job!

172
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,030
Job!

173
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,750
What's wrong?

174
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:48,020
Um... I don't think I sang that well.

175
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,270
A lot of people laughed at me.

176
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:57,030
Just ignore them.

177
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:00,590
I don't really care about them that much.

178
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,390
Cut!!!

179
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,070
What do you think you are doing??

180
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:08,990
Shit... I've had more than 10 takes with you guys.

181
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:13,110
Difficult dialogue? No! You studied acting.

182
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,790
What the hell is wrong with you guys?

183
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:19,390
-Pingpong, maybe we just change this..
-No! Zip it! I don't want to listen to any excuses.

184
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,910
Just go! Go take a rest. Go!

185
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,030
You come here.

186
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:32,070
Job, come here.

187
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,670
How late are we?

188
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:37,270
-We're 2 hours late.
-2 hours?

189
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,710
You had to know that I wasn't going to make it?

190
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:42,630
Come here, you. Come. Come here.

191
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,870
Why didn't you tell me we're behind!?

192
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:45,950
Huh!?

193
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:49,580
-Come here. You come here.
-Calm down, Pingpong.

194
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:55,110
You and I need to make a deal.

195
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:01,590
Let's do a cease-fire for now. Finish the job and talk.

196
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:06,030
A cease-fire? I don't see you as an enemy.

197
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,510
What are you saying?

198
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:14,190
I mean, you and I get the job done and just escape each other.

199
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:21,030
Yes. But, it's not like we can do it in one take?

200
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,150
You rehearse with me.

201
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:26,470
How?

202
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,830
The workshop.

203
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,910
That the professor taught.

204
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,510
Remember?

205
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:36,230
Yes. I remember. But which one?

206
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:51,780
Close your eyes.

207
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:32,230
Scene 3, cut 10, take 45. Action!

208
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:39,990
What's wrong, Tongfah?

209
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,710
I think I didn't do it well.

210
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,980
They all laughed.

211
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,470
Just ignore them.

212
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:07,510
Yeah, I don't really care about them.

213
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:23,510
Why do they turn so good now?

214
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:28,070
May it pay off for the shit I've had all day.

215
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,990
What happened Tongfah?

216
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:38,630
We haven't seen each other for a big while.

217
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,910
Ever since you left the school.

218
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,950
I had my own reasons.

219
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,910
Family issues?

220
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,830
Family issues.

221
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:08,310
What? The script doesn't have holding hands?

222
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:11,390
Shush! Let them be!

223
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,870
You know "magic moment"?

224
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:19,310
Do you want to talk to me about it?

225
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,950
Perhaps later.

226
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,910
I'm worried about you.

227
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:34,190
If you ever want to talk, I'm here.

228
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,470
Thanks.

229
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:51,670
Um, isn't it too romantic?

230
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:55,670
It's good the way it is.

231
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:59,670
Love does bloom anytime.

232
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:33,510
Tai, what are you thinking?

233
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,750
The food isn't good?

234
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:44,580
Are you in love? Have you fallen in love with someone?

235
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:49,790
What!! I took the right guess?

236
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:52,350
Woah! Easy, easy.

237
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:55,790
Answer me.

238
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,510
I met my soul mate.

239
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:00,990
What!! Are you for real?

240
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,390
Sorry.

241
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,350
When? How?

242
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,990
How did you know he was your soul mate?

243
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:11,150
Is he handsome? Hmm?

244
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:14,030
I found him at a coffee shop.

245
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:16,710
I remembered his voice.

246
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:20,510
When it rained, I asked his name.

247
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:22,270
So, I knew he's the same person.

248
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:25,430
So, you did answer to him.

249
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:29,590
How did you know his name?

250
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:32,350
I saw it on his gown.

251
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:34,790
He's a veterinarian at Sirivech Hospital.

252
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:36,230
Woahhh!

253
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:42,310
You haven't talked to him for 2 years, but he's been this close to you.

254
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,750
Does he know you're his soul mate?

255
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:50,140
I don't think so.

256
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:54,430
Because I haven't answered him.

257
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,630
He couldn't have remembered my voice.

258
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,390
Let me guess...

259
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:02,870
You met him for the first time and already started to like him?

260
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:03,670
Hmm?

261
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,390
Whattt! So cute!

262
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:15,470
Then what? How far are you two now? Hmm?

263
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:18,470
That's when it gets complicated.

264
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,110
I don't have the guts to talk to him.

265
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:22,590
What...

266
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:26,190
I just didn't know how to start, which topic to start, or what am I supposed to...

267
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,430
Saengtai, Saengtai.

268
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:29,870
If you like him, you talk to him first.

269
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:32,550
He is your soul mate.

270
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:35,270
When it rains, you talk to him.

271
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:42,230
I think he must be glad because he's been trying to reach you in these 2 years.

272
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:44,270
It's just... It's just that...

273
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:47,150
You like it so much?

274
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:50,470
To complicate things?

275
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:56,870
You like him, you make a move.

276
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:58,190
How?

277
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:02,030
Begin with things he likes or you like.

278
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,670
He's a vet?

279
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:05,990
Yes.

280
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,310
Duer.

281
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:12,750
Huh?

282
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,310
Duer?

283
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,550
Meow!

284
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,550
We're here.

285
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,190
We're here.

286
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,960
Are you afraid?

287
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,070
Sorry, bud.

288
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:13,790
Let's follow Bow's advice.

289
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:17,350
Hello! Is this the first time here?

290
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,430
Yes.

291
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:20,950
How can we be of the cat's service today?

292
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,110
It wants vaccines.

293
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:24,670
OK. Please fill in the profile form at the counter.

294
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:25,430
OK.

295
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:50,310
Just a moment please. The vet will come in.

296
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,150
Yes.

297
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:06,990
Hello! First time here?

298
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:09,430
Cat!

299
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:15,030
What an adorable cat!

300
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:17,590
The name's Duer.

301
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,110
Alright. Duer.

302
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:21,510
Mr. Saengtai...

303
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:27,790
Can I call you Saengtai, so we can be close?

304
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,500
I don't mind.

305
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:32,430
Let's bring the cat on here.

306
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:34,710
Come here.

307
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:36,510
First time?

308
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:38,510
On the back first.

309
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,470
It never got vaccines, right?

310
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,830
No, nothing.

311
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:48,510
I found Duer on the street.

312
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,550
Ah...

313
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,830
Is there something wrong?

314
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:03,430
Heart and lung seems normal.

315
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:05,110
Okay.

316
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:08,270
Let me see your front, buddy.

317
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:13,670
But we need to clean the ears, okay?

318
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:16,790
What about your teeth here?

319
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,470
Also normal, overall.

320
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:24,390
Today, I'll get the first vaccine for it.

321
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:26,110
-Please help hold it.
-Yes.

322
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:29,030
Hang on. Just a little jab.

323
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:31,150
-A little jab.
-Just a little of this.

324
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:36,070
Good job.

325
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:37,990
And, we're done.

326
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:40,470
You may take it home now.

327
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:42,150
Good job, good job.

328
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:53,870
Normally, how many vets do we have here?

329
00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:00,230
Normally, we have six veterinarians.

330
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:04,030
Four general vets, two specialist vets.

331
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:06,590
OK.

332
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,270
Is there something wrong?

333
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,950
No, nothing. It's just that...

334
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:16,830
I see this place is huge, so I just want to know how many.

335
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:23,110
Normally, if the attending is unavailable,

336
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:26,710
there will be a substituting attending.

337
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,790
Yeah?

338
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,190
Yes.

339
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:33,510
OK.

340
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,670
We're good for today.

341
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:40,990
Please bring it here again for the second vaccine in the next two weeks.

342
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:42,110
Don't forget.

343
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,710
I won't.

344
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:54,630
In the next 7 days, don't get it bathed.

345
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:57,630
And, please observe any irregular conditions.

346
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:01,790
If those conditions occur, you can always bring it here.

347
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:02,460
Sounds good.

348
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:06,270
And, the second vaccine, a kind reminder once again.

349
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,230
OK.

350
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,870
What happened?

351
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,910
No, I'm fine.

352
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,990
I meant...

353
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:44,110
Oh! I just got it a vaccine.

354
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:47,950
First vaccine?

355
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:52,430
First vaccine.

356
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:56,190
Duer, is it?

357
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:58,710
Got a jab, right?

358
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:01,270
Yes. It stayed the whole way through.

359
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:03,190
Good job.

360
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:09,590
How are you doing on "Unfuck It"?

361
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:15,110
Um, I wanted to revise it, so I wanted to see you.

362
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:23,990
Right.

363
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:26,190
Yeah?

364
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,230
Right.

365
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:35,540
Please excuse me. I have to go.

366
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:45,710
Who's in love around here?

367
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,630
Is the singing necessary?

368
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,470
It's just the right vibe.

369
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,110
Right?

370
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:52,510
What?

371
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:59,500
Pass it to Wit, pass it.

372
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:00,950
Who?

373
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,470
Let me do a roll call.

374
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:04,230
Here.

375
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,830
Wittaya?

376
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,350
Here.

377
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,070
Jessada?

378
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:09,910
Here.

379
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:11,550
Ratchanon?

380
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:12,510
Here.

381
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:15,270
Lomfon?

382
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,190
Here.

383
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:19,430
Saengtien?

384
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:23,470
If not here, then I may mark "absent".

385
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:27,110
-Here!
-Hoorayyy!

386
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:31,030
Just in time.

387
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:35,470
First class and you impress the professor just like that?

388
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,030
The prof will target you.

389
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:41,550
Everyone's targeting me. Yet, here I stand.

390
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:48,910
The new prof looks sloppy. Right?

391
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:51,950
Sloppy? This is an assistant professor.

392
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:53,350
Oh, okay.

393
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:57,070
Hello, all students.

394
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,830
Hello.

395
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:01,190
Before we get started,

396
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:03,870
I'm assigning you some mid-term work.

397
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:07,350
So, you guys got the objectives to study.

398
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:15,670
I'd like pairs of students to make a documentary.

399
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:18,430
Telling a story with visuals and silence.

400
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:23,270
Professor, but we haven't studied anything yet.

401
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:25,790
But you study film, am I right?

402
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:30,060
If you don't make films, how do you know you can make films?

403
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:31,470
Yes.

404
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:37,230
In terms of pairing, I'll randomize the names.

405
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:41,550
You are Saengtien?

406
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,150
Yes.

407
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,510
Please pair with Lomfon.

408
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:48,590
What!?

409
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:52,630
What?

410
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:54,910
Are you not close?

411
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:59,150
When you are on set, you work with only close friends?

412
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:04,230
Being on a set is being with humans.

413
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:07,460
If you can't collaborate with others,

414
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:11,430
I may have to consider hard about letting you pass this class.

415
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:40,950
Duer.

416
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:42,110
Come here.

417
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,270
I'm sorry.

418
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:50,110
Are you mad at me?

419
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,910
What have I done today?

420
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:03,430
How are you doing on "Unfuck It"?

421
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:08,750
Um, I wanted to revise it, so I wanted to see you.

422
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:14,110
In the next two weeks until seeing you, right?

423
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:22,790
You're hiding from me now?

424
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:29,510
Look, you needed to get the vaccine.

425
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:32,340
You can't blame me.

426
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:36,750
What now?

427
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,830
Mom asked,

428
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:44,230
Got any food request?

429
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:46,150
She'll prepare it.

430
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,469
No.

431
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:48,989
Sure?

432
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:50,620
Yeah.

433
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:00,430
Duer.

434
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:01,510
Hey!

435
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:05,910
I'll leave you alone.

436
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:24,510
Forty baht, please.

437
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,190
OK.

438
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:27,630
-Just enough. Here.
-OK.

439
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:28,710
Thank you.

440
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:32,350
Tien?

441
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:33,590
Just arrived?

442
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,910
A while ago.

443
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,430
Why not go in?

444
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:41,870
Should I though? I go in alone, I got complained alone.

445
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:45,150
You didn't do anything wrong. Why are you talking about complaints?

446
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:49,310
Oh my, I exist therefore I got complaints.

447
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:51,870
You don't know or just pretend to be dumb?

448
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:54,350
Just get inside. I want out already.

449
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:57,310
Did you really want to come?

450
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:59,470
Really wanted to come.

451
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:00,790
Reeeaaally!

452
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:08,310
Okay. I'll be in a hurry to check the timeline of the UAT and check with the developer again.

453
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:11,190
You think it’s too slow, right?

454
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:15,350
And, our database is ready.

455
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:21,910
I'll update the post-launch strategy asap.

456
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:23,990
Okay.

457
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:26,190
Mom.

458
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:30,030
To the table please. I'll catch you.

459
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:33,670
Hey, isn't it Sunday?

460
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:37,110
Have you ever seen her free from work?

461
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:43,790
Already managed. No worries.

462
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,230
What's with the fancy dress?

463
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:12,310
Ah. I'm meeting with a foreign client about a contract.

464
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,830
They happen to be available today.

465
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:16,110
I prepared all the food you like.

466
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:17,950
If want something more, tell me.

467
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:20,550
I wouldn't finish all this.

468
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:23,750
Alright. Eat then.

469
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,070
Tien.

470
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:35,070
The grades are not so good, you know?

471
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,030
Yes.

472
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:41,430
Skipped a lot of classes?

473
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,950
Why would I do that?

474
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:45,270
Why would I know that?

475
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:48,510
It's been a force of habit since your high school.

476
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:50,950
Maybe, things have changed?

477
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:56,670
If you don't want me to think like that, make good grades then.

478
00:37:57,070 --> 00:38:00,070
You got to study what you like, didn't you?

479
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:01,590
Yes.

480
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:06,350
And you, Tai? How's your work going?

481
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:07,990
So so, I guess?

482
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:11,790
"So so" doesn't really mean "good". Am I right?

483
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:15,060
I just talked to my friend in the UK.

484
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:19,070
If you want to go for a master's there, they will take care of you.

485
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:22,510
All the costs, I'll manage.

486
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,830
I don't remember telling you I want a master's?

487
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:28,470
I'm not forcing you.

488
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:31,310
It's not a crime just looking into it.

489
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:36,790
If you want to go study somewhere, we can always talk, right?

490
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:40,070
-I just don't want to see you waste your time with...
-Mom...

491
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:45,710
Why did you call Tien and me here? Is there anything important?

492
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,590
Remember Uncle Nu?

493
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:57,190
Uncle Nu, your boyfriend?

494
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:04,510
Uncle Nu and I may have decided that...

495
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:06,830
we're getting married.

496
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:12,990
Saengnuea and Saengchan already know this.

497
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:16,870
That's the reason I summoned you two here today.

498
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:19,710
Does Dad know?

499
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:23,830
-Yes, he does. And, he doesn't seem to...
-Mom!

500
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:26,110
Isn't it too fast?

501
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:34,030
How about Dad? How can he live?

502
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:42,670
I didn't expect this much of your selfishness.

503
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:43,510
Hey.

504
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:46,790
Tai.

505
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:53,670
I'll go talk to him.

506
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,070
Tai!

507
00:39:57,310 --> 00:40:02,630
Tai. Can you just calm down?

508
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,550
You can't do this.

509
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,150
Let me ask you this.

510
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,990
What is it that's "can" or "can't" for you, huh?

511
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,350
"Can" she remarry just like that?

512
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:15,550
You got me wrong.

513
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:18,350
You can't just walk away like this.

514
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:21,070
You didn't even try to talk to her.

515
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:25,390
Talking to her now won't make me understand.

516
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:31,150
You know...

517
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:36,230
Every time I see Dad, I can always feel it.

518
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:39,950
I feel that Dad still loves her.

519
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:45,590
To tell you the truth, I'm confident...

520
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:49,230
that I shouldn't talk to my soul mate.

521
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:41,110
Rain.

522
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:45,350
Sorry. Let's chat later.

523
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:49,750
You heard that, didn't you?

524
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:55,430
I'm sorry. That won't happen again.

525
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:05,630
Saengtai

526
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:20,670
Isn't it Lomfon?

527
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:24,630
Wasn't sure you'd remember.

528
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:28,830
Wasn't sure about your name. But, I remember you.

529
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:31,110
Are you working?

530
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:33,180
Yes.

531
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:37,470
I always come here to work when I'm free.

532
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:42,230
Don't you have to go to class?

533
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:44,310
It's canceled today.

534
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:47,030
Tien didn't tell you?

535
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:50,190
We don't live together.

536
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:52,790
We'd fight to death, otherwise.

537
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:54,790
Agreed.

538
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:57,510
You and that brat are very different.

539
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:09,110
Oh!

540
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:12,510
I like that book so much!

541
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:16,230
Me too. It's my second time reading it.

542
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:17,150
Really?

543
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:19,150
I've read 2 times too.

544
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:22,630
Did you read the other books by this author?

545
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:25,590
No. Will you suggest some?

546
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:29,670
Yes. Here. All good stuff. Hang on.

547
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:39,830
Seriously?

548
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:41,030
I love that too!

549
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:46,300
The first-published version was so rare!

550
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:48,750
You know what, I got that version.

551
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:49,630
Really?

552
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:59,510
No way! How!

553
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:03,630
This one is so hard to find.

554
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:06,470
I really want it.

555
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:16,750
Can I get your address?

556
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:19,550
Huh?

557
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:22,430
I'll ship it to you.

558
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:29,390
It's OK, Lomfon. I know it's hard to find and it's expensive.

559
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:30,950
You keep it.

560
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:33,780
I just see your wish.

561
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:39,710
And, I think these books belong to the one who really loves them.

562
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:41,550
Better that way.

563
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:46,590
Also, you are the bigger fan of this author than I am. So...

564
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:53,070
Um...

565
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:58,950
Alright. I'll pay you.

566
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:01,310
Just give me your bank account.

567
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:02,780
No need.

568
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:04,910
Buy me a coffee. That should do.

569
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:07,030
Really?

570
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:16,630
One more Americano, please.

571
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:17,250
Okay.

572
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:19,270
Do you want anything?

573
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,630
Never mind.

574
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:22,710
Okay.

575
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:29,910
Thank you.

576
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:48,030
Frankly, you're the first one I feel fun to talk to about books.

577
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:52,470
Right.

578
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:59,190
I think, it feels nice when two people talk about their mutual interests.

579
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:07,510
It's fascinating to discover someone who shares my passions - just like you, don't you think?

580
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:19,350
Um, nice convo always carries away, right? Maybe I should continue working.

581
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:21,630
I may work now.

582
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:22,670
OK.

583
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:47,550
Same vet, please. Same vet, please.

584
00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:52,350
The owner of Duer may come in now.

585
00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:53,300
Yes.

586
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:07,510
Hello, there.

587
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:09,750
Here we go again.

588
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:13,190
The second jab now, right Duer?

589
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:15,870
Be good.

590
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:18,300
Hurt a bit, okay?

591
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:20,110
Stay still. Stay.

592
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:22,070
Not gonna hurt, okay Duer?

593
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:23,430
-Woah, woah!
-Woah, woah!

594
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:24,150
Duer!

595
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:25,830
Duer! Duer!

596
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:28,030
Guys, it's running away!

597
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:28,870
What happened?

598
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:30,030
Cat's running away. I was giving it a vaccine.

599
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:32,190
-Where?
-You move first!

600
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:34,750
Stop! Naughty cat!

601
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:36,670
Oh!!

602
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:38,630
Duer!

603
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:45,350
Here you are, you naughty cat!

604
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:50,830
-Wait!
-Woah!

605
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:52,710
-Duer!
-Duer!

606
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:54,190
Duer!

607
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:00,590
Duer!

608
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:08,030
Duer!

609
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:27,430
Your name is Saengtai, right?

610
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:28,590
I'm Phat.

611
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:30,790
See? We know each other now.

612
00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:32,630
Didn't you hear what the professor said?

613
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:33,590
Why didn't you say something?

614
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:36,310
How about you? Why didn't you say you didn't want to pair up with me?

615
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:37,270
That's my glass!!

616
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:40,270
You got someone else. You shouldn't talk to me!
