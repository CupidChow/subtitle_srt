00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,230
Tai, as your father, I didn't think that I'd get to meet your soul mate.

3
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,030
Father!?

4
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:28,910
Yeah.

5
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:29,950
Let's hide from the rain.

6
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,750
Maybe my place? It's not far from here.

7
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,390
So I can get into your home?

8
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,670
Tai, do you have a bath towel...

9
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,110
Tai, I'm out of the shower.

10
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,870
You can go now.

11
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,550
What's wrong? Are you shy?

12
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:28,990
No. I'm not.

13
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,150
Then, go and take a bath or you'll feel uncomfortable.

14
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,110
Patts...

15
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,870
I didn't see anything.

16
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,590
You liar!

17
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:58,310
Okay. I only saw a little.

18
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,580
Then, I went to take the shower.

19
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,510
Not buying it!

20
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,750
Did you see my scar?

21
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,270
Do you have a scar?

22
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,339
I didn't see it.

23
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:22,510
See? Liar. That was a test for you.

24
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:26,150
How can you be so sure I don't have a scar?

25
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,710
You said you didn't see.

26
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,630
Liar.

27
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:38,230
Alright. What can I do now,

28
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:42,150
to make you happy, not embarrassed, and...

29
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,750
take a bath?

30
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,470
How about this?

31
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:59,870
I'll just take this bath towel off.

32
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,300
You'll see me naked.

33
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,190
Then we'll call it even. Alright?

34
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,430
I'm taking it off now.

35
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,990
Patts! Stop!

36
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:34,429
If you were someone else, I would not think too much and just stop here.

37
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,510
But now, I want to wait for you to be ready.

38
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,590
I hope this is not a momentary impulse.

39
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,550
I want you to know

40
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:57,550
that you're important to me.

41
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,230
Go to take your shower.

42
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:07,510
The woman in the picture is your mother, right?

43
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,470
Yes.

44
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,470
What's the place in this picture?

45
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,830
It's Doi Mae Pliang, in Chiangmai.

46
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:23,710
Oh. Is the mountain raining all year long?

47
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,470
Yes.

48
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:54,150
It is said that if someone can climb to the top of the mountain

49
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:58,470
when it rains,

50
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,830
any wish he makes can come true.

51
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:07,590
My parents reached the top on a rainy day.

52
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:15,670
And then, my father proposed.

53
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,310
That's romantic.

54
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:41,350
But, they are divorced.

55
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:47,430
When we reach some point,

56
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:50,430
the point where we've grown,

57
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:56,110
you'll realize that only love is not enough to stay together with your loved-ones.

58
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:59,990
But, I trust in the bond between you two.

59
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:02,630
You guys will make it.

60
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,670
OK.

61
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:21,190
In fact, I think you should go there.

62
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:29,350
I don't know if you can understand what I'm going to say.

63
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:33,470
But I think this wish thing

64
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,870
is like our thoughts.

65
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,470
Our thoughts?

66
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:41,830
What do you mean?

67
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:47,470
If you go there, you might get to know something,

68
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:50,870
and you can understand your parents better.

69
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:07,750
Let's go there when we have time.

70
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:18,430
It's up to you. When will you be available?

71
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,630
We'll see.

72
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:51,790
As for our hospital's corporate social responsibility,

73
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:59,310
in the past two years, we helped the society by funding financial support to various charity projects.

74
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:02,550
We are pretty busy in hospital everyday.

75
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:09,070
Now, Fluke and Ruj, our respected seniors,

76
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:12,110
also the founders of this hospital,

77
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:16,390
think we need to carry on what they did,

78
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:20,350
which is exactly the two projects I have mentioned.

79
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:24,700
But, our respected seniors are unwilling to do by themselves.

80
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,310
And, they might have expected that we can take this.

81
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:28,590
Am I correct?

82
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:31,830
Patts, you can't say that.

83
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,910
It's our second time to do this project.

84
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:37,870
And, I don't see any other project is the better

85
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:41,500
for us to help out the society.

86
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:44,070
See? Did I make myself clear?

87
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:49,350
OK. Actually, I did some research.

88
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,550
And, I have an idea.

89
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,590
Doi Mae Pliang village?

90
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,460
We didn't do our project there.

91
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:05,550
Pang Pliang village, Doi Mae Pliang.

92
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,510
In Chiangmai?

93
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,110
Yes.

94
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,350
Why do you choose this village, Patts?

95
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:14,750
The previous one you got wasn't bad.

96
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,590
And, it's much more closer to here.

97
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,420
That's the point.

98
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:26,230
Pang Pliang village is quite far from the city.

99
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:29,110
From the map, we can get to know that

100
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:33,990
villagers need to walk one to two hours to get to the hospital in the city.

101
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:37,470
With that distance,

102
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,510
villagers find it inconvenient to get animals being treated.

103
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:43,950
I have already called the relevant organization for consultation.

104
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:50,110
And I learned that the village is divided into five sub-villages

105
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:53,590
with a total of 158 households.

106
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:58,110
Many families have pet cats and dogs,

107
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:01,230
which takes account of 70%.

108
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:06,310
So does that mean that it's inconvenient for villagers to get their pets being treated in hospitals.

109
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:10,510
and there is no organization has reached out to them?

110
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:14,430
Because the village is relatively poor and remote.

111
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:19,430
So the problem is that the number of animals has increased a lot.

112
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:20,870
as they are not properly sterilized.

113
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:25,310
Besides, most of the animals do not get the vaccines that they need.

114
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:29,070
So I think that compared to the previous choice,

115
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:32,390
this choice is better.

116
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,710
I agree.

117
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:38,630
Hey! Way to go! Patts!

118
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:43,430
But going to Chiangmai is a huge deal.

119
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:48,990
If you choose this one, you need to get more people.

120
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:52,910
Only a few of us are too busy to handle it.

121
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,590
Don't you worry about that.

122
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:01,670
Fluke, Ruj, our university will arrange a volunteering camp.

123
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:04,190
We can get in contact with faculty of Veterinary Science,

124
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:08,140
to see who would like to volunteer with us as a vet.

125
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:11,589
They will definitely approve a good project like this.

126
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,589
Good job!

127
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:16,190
Let's do this!

128
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:20,910
I'll do the paperwork and talk to the university.

129
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:23,670
I'll keep you informed of something new.

130
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:26,150
OK. Let's call it a day.

131
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,190
Patts!

132
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,190
Yes.

133
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,950
Great job.

134
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,070
-Very good!
-Thank you.

135
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,660
-I think so, too.
 -Really?

136
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:01,030
What are you standing there for?

137
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:05,070
Saengtien!

138
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,430
Yes?

139
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:08,790
Lomfon!

140
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,990
What a coincidence, my dear friend!

141
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,710
Come here.

142
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,750
How can I help you, Pingpong?

143
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,550
Today...

144
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:25,630
Please don't tell us your reshooting stuff.

145
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:26,910
I'm going to hit your mouth!

146
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,670
Hit it hard! You'll see!

147
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:33,270
That work is done and I got four credits.

148
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,510
However, today...

149
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,990
I'll invite you to my wrap party!

150
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,990
Woohoo!

151
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,630
Can I not go, Pingpong?

152
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:55,670
I really don't want to go.

153
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:56,750
Hey!

154
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,830
What did you just say?

155
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,910
-Okay, I'll go.
 -He's missing a big one.

156
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,900
Awesome!

157
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,830
Look at Saengtien. He never rejects me.

158
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:07,750
Of course not!

159
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,350
So, let's go now.

160
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,110
Hey, Pingpong.

161
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,790
Can we come with you?

162
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,830
Did you play a role in the video?

163
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,550
No.

164
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,870
Are you in this project?

165
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:18,670
No.

166
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:19,830
Did you do something?

167
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:20,670
Not really.

168
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:22,710
Then, you can't come.

169
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,430
I'll be waiting at home. See you!

170
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,870
Okay.

171
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:31,790
Pingpong.

172
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:32,510
Yeah?

173
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,110
We go with this outfit?

174
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:37,670
Hey. It's a party in my house.

175
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:40,660
Chill. You can dress anything you want.

176
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:42,910
Got it?

177
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:44,150
Okay. Got it.

178
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,790
Besides, most of my friends are going to graduate.

179
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:51,830
You will definitely be able to expand your network this time.

180
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:52,790
See you then.

181
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,550
I'll wait for you!

182
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,990
Okay!

183
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,030
Let's get some drinks, then.

184
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,270
Thank you.

185
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,670
What's up, Patts?

186
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:45,110
Do you remember what we talked about last night?

187
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:48,390
Where is the place in the picture?

188
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,230
Doi Mae Pliang, in Chiangmai.

189
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:54,750
Oh. Is the mountain raining all year long?

190
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:59,350
My parents reached the top on a rainy day.

191
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:03,510
And then, my father proposed.

192
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:06,670
Yeah.

193
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,710
I want you to go there.

194
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,110
Today, we talked about CSR in hospital.

195
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:20,470
We finally decided to go there for a project.

196
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:24,190
And, we collaborate with a university.

197
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:27,510
Those who are interested can also go together.

198
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:32,750
Would you like to come with me?

199
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:38,910
But what can I do there?

200
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:45,710
I'd feel useless, if I went.

201
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:50,590
There are actually many things to do.

202
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:54,550
Maybe you choose something that you can do.

203
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,990
I'm afraid I don't want to go.

204
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:21,510
Because of the camp or Doi Mae Pliang the place?

205
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,750
Okay.

206
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:41,710
I understand.

207
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:45,830
But may I speak from my perspective?

208
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:51,670
Nothing is more important than you.

209
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,780
And I do think that

210
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:58,590
we might find more about our state of being soul mates,

211
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:02,790
if we go there together.

212
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:14,790
Okay. Let's have our meal.

213
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,670
Okay.

214
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:38,110
Cheers!

215
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:41,390
Woohoo!

216
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:47,630
To tell you the truth, I want to thank all of you.

217
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:50,910
You have worked so hard until the last minute.

218
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:53,310
I scolded all of you, but you weren't angry with me.

219
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:56,070
Cheers!

220
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:58,310
Yay!

221
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:00,670
Woah.

222
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:02,510
Woah.

223
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,510
Saengtien is the real deal!

224
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,670
Wow.

225
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:08,550
Woohoo!

226
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,750
That's how we do it!

227
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:12,190
Everyone, this is Saengtien.

228
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,390
I'm thirsty all of the sudden.

229
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:20,870
Let your Pingpong man fill your cup.

230
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:23,510
-Hey!
-Nice!

231
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,310
Awesome sauce.

232
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,870
Awesome sauce!

233
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:31,870
Cheers!

234
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:36,390
Aren't you really good at this?

235
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:39,390
Trying to play the cool?

236
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:42,910
Mr. Lomfon, please drink it.

237
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:45,350
Bottoms up. Bottoms up. Bottoms up.

238
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:48,950
More. More. More and more.

239
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:52,510
A round of applause!!

240
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,950
Attaboy!

241
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,830
Where's Job?

242
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:02,510
Job!

243
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,230
Job!

244
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:05,510
Job!

245
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,750
Job!

246
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:07,870
Job!

247
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:10,270
Maybe he is drunk and went back?

248
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:12,350
I saw he puked at the front gate.

249
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,390
Really?

250
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,270
Yes!

251
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,510
What!

252
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:18,470
-Job! 
 -Hold on.

253
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,350
You come here.

254
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,550
You are my assistant here, not a dog.

255
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,030
Who's get to buy some ice for me?

256
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,510
We are running out of it.

257
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:29,030
-Job! We need you to go buy it! 
-I can!

258
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,390
I can go to buy the ice.

259
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:32,110
Oh, please behave yourself.

260
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,150
You're too dumb for this!

261
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:34,350
I let you buy ice, but you get me coke.

262
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:36,150
I tell coke, and you buy Sprite.

263
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:38,510
I'll just buy it in person.

264
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:40,190
You guys come with me. Help me out there

265
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,510
I'll pay.

266
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,550
Okay?

267
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,510
(Together) Yay!

268
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:47,110
-Let's go! 
 -I pay it all for you all!

269
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,590
It's just for you all.

270
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,590
I'll pay for it.

271
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,310
Buy as much as you want. Can you grab…

272
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,230
Where are you going?

273
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,070
To buy the ice?

274
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:56,230
Um, sir, please shut up and have a seat.

275
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,750
Just stay in the house.

276
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,990
I'll go and buy it.

277
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,590
My house is in your hands.

278
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:02,270
I got it, bro!

279
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,860
See you, bro.

280
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:09,510
Are you okay?

281
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:10,830
Yes.

282
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:15,270
I don't think so.

283
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,510
You're now as soft as water.

284
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:31,630
Oh, your shoulder is soft.

285
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,470
Can I stay here for a minute?

286
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:16,150
Why are you staring at me?

287
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:19,110
Nothing.

288
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:29,470
Can I sleep here?

289
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,590
Okay.

290
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,190
Good.

291
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:28,110
Cheers!

292
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:40,110
You're not that bad when you are drunk.

293
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:03,710
Shit.

294
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,110
What the hell is the water?

295
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:11,910
Come here.

296
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:14,270
Brother. My brother!

297
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,190
Get in!

298
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,270
Watch your head. Your head!

299
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,830
Oh, oh!

300
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:20,830
Move! Move!

301
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:28,060
He's quite heavy.

302
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:32,260
Luckily, he can call you to pick him up.

303
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:34,550
Here.

304
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:35,910
Thank you.

305
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,630
He always doing this.

306
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:42,630
When he's do drunk, he always makes some trouble for me.

307
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:45,270
How do you go home?

308
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,670
Or you'll stay?

309
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:50,030
I told them I wanted to call it a night.

310
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:52,510
If I stay, it'll be called morning.

311
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:54,710
And, I got a cab, too.

312
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,510
It'll be here soon.

313
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,910
Okay. I should go then,

314
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:01,910
before he pukes in there.

315
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:03,190
Okay.

316
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:10,500
Hey, thank you for taking care of him.

317
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,470
If there's anything I can help you, please let me know.

318
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:14,350
Just be my guest.

319
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:19,110
Well, can I have a dinner with you?

320
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:23,150
OK.

321
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:27,940
I got to go.

322
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:32,510
Saengtai. Can I get your number?

323
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:37,110
I wonder if you can tell me when Saengtien arrives his place.

324
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,070
Sure.

325
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:52,470
-Thank you.
 -See you.

326
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,710
Tien. Move!

327
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:58,910
You're such a big baby.

328
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:01,190
(Singing) I'm a big baby.

329
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,470
Let's go.

330
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:06,380
(Singing) Who's the big baby?

331
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:41,070
Ugh! I hate headache!

332
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,510
Well...

333
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:45,710
Well, what?

334
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:48,030
Don't you throw up here.

335
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:53,270
Drink that much and wake up this early? I'm kind of respect you.

336
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:58,870
Woah!

337
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:00,950
Saengtien is the real deal!

338
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:05,590
I have to take the class.

339
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,230
How was last night?

340
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:10,990
They might stay to the morning.

341
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:13,150
I went home after sending you off.

342
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:22,550
Did you do anything weird to me?

343
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,390
What are you saying?

344
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:42,830
Only you got drunk and threw a drunken fit last night.

345
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,390
Really?

346
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,430
I'm normally cute when I'm drunk.

347
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:51,190
But my ribs hurt when I'm awake.

348
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:53,150
And also my back.

349
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:55,910
Did you kick me?

350
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:00,910
Or the taxi driver kicked me.

351
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:05,310
Why didn't you look after me?

352
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:10,710
You were just drunk and being a big burden. That was all.

353
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:12,750
Especially troubled your brother.

354
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:13,630
Tai, you mean?

355
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:18,190
Bro, my bro!

356
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:19,230
Get in!

357
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,150
Watch your head. Your head!

358
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:21,630
Oh, oh!

359
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:25,150
Move! Move!

360
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:31,390
He's quite heavy.

361
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:36,590
Jesus. Are you for real?

362
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:40,030
He'll definitely tell my parents.

363
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:42,030
I'm dead.

364
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:43,910
What should I do?

365
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:45,990
Holy shit!

366
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:49,430
-You... 
-Excuse me.

367
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:04,110
Veterinary Volunteering Camp...

368
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:07,270
by the Faculty of Veterinary Science,

369
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:10,670
collaborating with a vet hospital in Mae Pliang District,

370
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:14,310
Chiang Mai province.

371
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:16,710
Hey..

372
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,350
You know what I'm thinking, right?

373
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:26,310
I'm thinking what you're thinking.

374
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:29,110
Listen to me.

375
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:32,550
The camp's got vets,

376
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:35,389
animals, and villagers.

377
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:37,469
And villages on the mountain.

378
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:42,139
We just roll the camera from the start,

379
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:45,469
until the moment they treat the animals.

380
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,670
I figured the concept out!

381
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:50,909
We figured the concept out.

382
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:53,190
We figure the concept out!

383
00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:01,430
You do the PPT work. We must hurry to hand it to our professor.

384
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:03,430
Good job, Lomfon.

385
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:06,430
What will you do then?

386
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:08,510
Presenting.

387
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,630
Do you not help me with the PPT?

388
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:13,790
I present. You do the PPT.

389
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:17,550
We do our own job. Yeah!

390
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:20,030
We both need to present.

391
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:22,550
I can present by myself.

392
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,790
OK. Double check the stuff.

393
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:45,590
Do you know what's wrong with him?

394
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,590
He looks so gloomy.

395
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,590
Are you OK with this?

396
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:58,510
I'm here!

397
00:35:58,990 --> 00:35:59,870
Hurry up, will you?

398
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:01,110
You are so slow.

399
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:05,990
What's wrong with Patts?

400
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:08,700
The one he invited doesn't come.

401
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:11,590
I heard he has been pursuing that person for a long time.

402
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:12,590
Yeah.

403
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:16,470
Until now, they are not officially dating yet.

404
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:18,750
Just in the stage of learning each other.

405
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:21,710
But you guys are wrong.

406
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:34,950
Ahem.

407
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,590
Saengtai.

408
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,230
What's up?

409
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:48,990
What are you doing here?

410
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:51,910
Because you wanted me to come.

411
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:56,510
Yes, but I'm not expecting that.

412
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:03,950
I said I don't want to come, didn't mean that wouldn't.

413
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:09,510
Do you feel being enforced?

414
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:10,870
No.

415
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:14,470
I gave it a thought about what you said.

416
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:20,470
Going to Doi Mae Pliang might get me something.

417
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:27,150
Did you ask for a leave from work?

418
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:29,030
Well, about that.

419
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:32,790
Here's how it went.

420
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:39,190
I made a proposal to the company that I could write a column about the vets taking care of the animals in the community.

421
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:42,030
Bow supports this idea.

422
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:45,030
They liked the proposal. So we're here.

423
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,470
That's nice.

424
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:57,070
Ahem. Ahem.

425
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,870
You guys are so cute. I want to barf.

426
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:02,270
How long are you two going to talk?

427
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:03,550
Yeah?

428
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:09,470
OK. Why not both of you join my team now?

429
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:10,870
You team?

430
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,830
I'll introduce Bow to everyone.

431
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:16,430
I'd love to! I love to meet new people!

432
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:17,230
Hello!

433
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:22,070
Especially meeting a hot, kind, sporty, and pet-loving guy!

434
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:26,270
Great! Can you help carry these?

435
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:27,950
Here.

436
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:29,030
All of these?

437
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,590
Yes.

438
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,230
And this one?

439
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,550
All of these.

440
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:36,070
Thank you very much.

441
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:37,310
Let me help you.

442
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:38,950
Thanks for the help.

443
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:41,150
You can put it in my car.

444
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,310
Not too heavy, right?

445
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:43,870
No, not at all.

446
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:45,470
-Please hurry. 
-You guys have to carry all of these?

447
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:46,950
I'll be back for that bag.

448
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:49,790
Okay.

449
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:13,990
Pull over!

450
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:15,230
What?

451
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:21,110
Do you want me to drive?

452
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:24,110
No need. You actually slept all the way through.

453
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:29,830
Dude. We're here.

454
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:33,350
So beautiful.

455
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:58,630
Tien, we have to go.

456
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,230
Or we'll be late.

457
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:03,780
Okay.

458
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:08,430
Don't be so slow.

459
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:11,070
You peed so frequent.

460
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:25,350
It's normal, right?

461
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:27,550
We'll be here for several days.

462
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:41,950
Wow! Saengtai!

463
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:44,270
Here is beautiful.

464
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:49,030
Come here, Saengtai!

465
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:53,310
Chiangmai's so beautiful!

466
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:56,030
Come on. Come here!

467
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:02,030
Look at the umbrellas. So cute!

468
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:04,910
Wow.

469
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:19,550
They really prepared something.

470
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:22,430
That gal is quite over the top.

471
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:39,870
Hello.

472
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:43,310
Hello, everyone.

473
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:46,300
You all are looking good.

474
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:49,950
Let me introduce myself.

475
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:52,310
My name is Kung.

476
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:58,990
I'll be taking care of you guys in this camp.

477
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:06,350
Who's got some concerns or doubts, please text me.

478
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:10,830
I have my social media. You can add me as a friend.

479
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:14,910
That woman is definitely something.

480
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:21,110
Now, let me start with the first thing.

481
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:29,950
Firstly, I'd like you to pair up as roommates.

482
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:43,550
Who's got their roommate, please take your keys and refreshing water right here.

483
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:50,990
You look sharp.

484
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:53,270
Bow.

485
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:56,260
Stop. I know what you're about to say.

486
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:03,230
This is exactly why you two don't get any closer.

487
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:04,190
Come on.

488
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:07,630
I'm really worried about you.

489
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:11,030
You're not going to be my roommate?

490
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,190
No.

491
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:17,060
Who's going to be your roommate then, if it's not me?

492
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:19,390
I'll just find someone.

493
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:22,310
So, I get to make new friends.

494
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:23,630
Tai.

495
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:26,430
Tai.

496
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:33,350
I got the key. Shall we go to our room?

497
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:38,190
What are you doing?

498
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:39,870
Dr Patts is waiting.

499
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:47,630
Everything OK?

500
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:48,750
Yes.

501
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:51,590
Everything is OK.

502
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:52,910
Everything.

503
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:55,470
Let's go then.

504
00:43:58,470 --> 00:43:59,500
I get to go, Bow.

505
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:02,750
Yeah, you go.

506
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:03,910
See you, Bow.

507
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:05,950
Bye bye. Take good care of him!

508
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:07,190
Sure.

509
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:16,270
Oh. I think I left something in the car.

510
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:17,830
Please wait here.

511
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:19,190
I'll be right back.

512
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,230
OK.

513
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:29,430
It's definitely OK.

514
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:37,310
You are so beautiful.

515
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:42,140
You, too.

516
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:45,630
Yeah.

517
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:47,230
Are those flowers for me?

518
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:47,990
Yeah.

519
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:49,310
Who's my roommate?

520
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:51,430
It's me, Kung, yeah.

521
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:56,110
Yeah, take your flowers.

522
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,350
What's the drink?

523
00:44:57,350 --> 00:44:59,070
Cantella asiatica juice, yeah.

524
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:04,270
It's fresh, I prepared it just for you.

525
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:05,270
To clear inner hear, huh?

526
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:06,070
Yeah.

527
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:39,070
OK.

528
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:47,270
We're finally here.

529
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:51,260
Where should we go first?

530
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:55,190
How would I know? I came with you.

531
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:02,870
Tai!

532
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:16,230
Why are you here?

533
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:17,710
I want to ask you that.

534
00:46:17,790 --> 00:46:21,470
Lomfon and I are on a school project.

535
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:23,630
So why are you here?

536
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:26,980
I'm doing a research for my column here.

537
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:28,790
In this VVC?

538
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:35,590
Yeah. The vet hospital of my soul mate organizes this camp.

539
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:37,990
Soul mate!

540
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:42,940
This is going to be the first time I meet your soul mate, bro!

541
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:45,510
Yeah.

542
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:52,310
What?

543
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:55,390
Lomfon. My brother's soul mate!

544
00:46:57,670 --> 00:47:00,030
So your soul mate is here?

545
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:03,630
You'll see him soon.

546
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:09,030
Ouch.

547
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:12,110
Soul mate?

548
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:14,030
What can I do for you?

549
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:32,670
Where did you get this key chain?

550
00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:34,550
Hey.

551
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:37,430
You guys are my brother-in-law's friends.

552
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:40,150
So you will take good care of me, right?

553
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:42,590
He's not your brother-in-law.

554
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:45,670
I warn you.

555
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:48,150
