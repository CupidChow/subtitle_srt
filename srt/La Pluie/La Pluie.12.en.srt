1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,950
Do you really want to quit?

3
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:27,950
If Saengtai and I are not soul mates,

4
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,230
we are incompatible.

5
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:32,990
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,790
Let's start a new beginning.

7
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:43,150
Tai. I know that you broke up with Patts.

8
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,670
Hey, bro?

9
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:37,950
What's up?

10
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:42,829
This is my final script. Can you give me some advice?

11
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,700
What's the topic?

12
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,070
"The message from your heart".

13
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,430
What kind of story do you want to tell?

14
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,910
I want to tell a story about relationship,

15
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,030
just like...

16
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,950
Based on a true story?

17
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,150
Is it relevant?

18
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,510
It's a story between you and Saengtien.

19
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,150
Well, listen to me.

20
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:19,630
I'm close to both of you.

21
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,190
How could I not think of that?

22
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:32,030
Do you want to talk here or in a bar?

23
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:34,670
Here would be fine.

24
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,230
Okay. Tell me everything.

25
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,590
I'm available until eight at night.

26
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:46,510
Well... I like Saengtien.

27
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,950
Cool. Good for you.

28
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,630
Then?

29
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,790
In fact, Saengtien likes me too.

30
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:01,270
None of us realized and showed it.

31
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,270
Yeah.

32
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:07,270
But, I messed up.

33
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:13,550
I messed up so much that if I were him, I would never forgive myself.

34
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,790
What do you want to do now?

35
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:19,430
I want him to forgive me.

36
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,269
Yes.

37
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:21,430
I want to talk to him clearly.

38
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,550
Yup. What's next? What's your plan?

39
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:28,310
I must let him forgive me.

40
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,030
Yes.

41
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,710
And, I tell him my feeling towards him.

42
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:35,270
There you go! The story comes from your real life.

43
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,230
This is your topic.

44
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,790
This is the story that you are going to tell.

45
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,110
Then, you only need to polish your script based on that.

46
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:46,790
You do that in your own way. That's it.

47
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:50,430
You need to be true to your heart.

48
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:01,110
If you're not true to yourself,

49
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,150
you can't tell the story well.

50
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:07,710
Besides, if your film is based on your real story

51
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,750
with your real feelings,

52
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:17,310
I do believe that Tien can get you.

53
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,790
I'm sure about that.

54
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:27,310
And now, the film of your true story is right behind you.

55
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,870
Make it good!

56
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,710
Hey, what's up?

57
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,430
Make it good!

58
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:49,190
What did you say to Pingpong?

59
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,630
Why did you say my name?

60
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:55,990
I was... like...

61
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:03,390
Tien, wait! Tien!

62
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,710
What are you doing?

63
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:14,070
You know that I like you, then you can mess around?

64
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,190
That's not funny.

65
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,310
It's not like that.

66
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,990
Then, like what?

67
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,590
Like what? Say it.

68
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,110
Say it!

69
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,070
Tien!

70
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,590
I'll show you with practical actions.

71
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,390
Was the traffic bad?

72
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,470
A little bit.

73
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:28,590
I ordered mocha smoothie for you.

74
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:35,909
Do you want a cake? I'll order that.

75
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:38,510
That's OK. Thank you. This is enough.

76
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:44,470
We haven't seen for a long time. You still remember that I like mocha smoothie.

77
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:50,950
Each time I see that, I'll think of you.

78
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:04,510
Nara, did Patts contact you?

79
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:09,430
Don't tell me that he hasn't contacted you.

80
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:15,830
It's been two weeks. We still can't reach him.

81
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,950
I know that he wants to be alone.

82
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:22,710
But I did remind him to contact us occasionally.

83
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,670
And what about Saengtai?

84
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,630
Does he have any updates?

85
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:34,070
Seriously, I don't think Saengtai and Lomfon are dating.

86
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:42,830
Yeah. We can just send Saengtai and Patts our best wishes. That's it.

87
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:48,630
But, I still believe that they do love each other.

88
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,390
You did see them, right?

89
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,670
Nara.

90
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,710
Hmm?

91
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:10,110
I know that you loved Patts.

92
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,910
But I want to ask you something.

93
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:24,030
Have you been opened to a new relationship?

94
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,510
Can I ask you a question?

95
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,350
Why do you want to know that?

96
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,710
Which kind of coffee do you like?

97
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,790
Espresso.

98
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:07,790
Okay. Next time I see espresso, I'll think of you.

99
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:19,630
As for you, love is not that difficult, right?

100
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:28,870
If you want to get me, then you go ahead. I'm a grown woman.

101
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,670
It's a lovely day today.

102
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,990
Umm.

103
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,190
So lovely.

104
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:12,350
Okay. Next one will be Lomfon.

105
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,830
Please get prepared.

106
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,750
The message from my heart.

107
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:34,190
It may be a story or some remembered images

108
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,110
that lingers in one's heart.

109
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:40,260
For someone, it might be a mistake

110
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:43,270
that makes them feel pain.

111
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:49,710
For me, I want it to make me move forward,

112
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,190
and make me happy with it.

113
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,990
It's because the message from my heart

114
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,950
is the thing I want the most in my life.

115
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:51,710
Tien, how come you are the thing from Lomfon's heart?

116
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:58,190
Don't you tell us that you and Lomfon...

117
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:01,230
Excuse me, professor. I need to use the bathroom.

118
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:02,950
What's happening?

119
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:07,030
Lomfon! Lomfon!

120
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:12,110
-What on earth is happening?
Did he use the wrong files?

121
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,510
Please be quiet.

122
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,070
Tien!

123
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,150
Tien!

124
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,270
Don't go!

125
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,550
Why did you do that?

126
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,870
That's the topic.

127
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,190
"The message from my heart".

128
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,710
Then why did I in your video?

129
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,750
What are you going to say?

130
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,710
I have already told you.

131
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:51,230
I would show you with my actions.

132
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:56,630
I did this because I like you!

133
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:06,750
I know. I used to like your brother.

134
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:15,270
But when I got to know you, and know you more,

135
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,790
my feelings changed.

136
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:23,390
All of the things that I have done

137
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:25,790
was because I was confused.

138
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,790
Now, I get to know my heart.

139
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:35,390
I know that I like you.

140
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,510
I like you very much.

141
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:47,230
I like you so much that I don't know what to do.

142
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:56,990
I like you so much that I think if I don't tell my feelings to you,

143
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:02,030
I will be regret it for the rest of my life.

144
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:14,790
You told me that you always follow your heart.

145
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:22,270
And now, don't you feel something?

146
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,190
Why do you smile?

147
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,830
I am so happy.

148
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:48,030
I don't like that smile.

149
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:53,190
But, you'll see that every day from now on.

150
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:54,430
Every day?

151
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:03,470
Do you want to continue watching my film?

152
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:05,430
I will be embarrassed.

153
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,750
I will be embarrassed.

154
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:11,030
I edited it to confess my love for you.

155
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,109
You're over the top.

156
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:16,190
Then shall we wait for another five minutes?

157
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:22,030
Stop staring at me!

158
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,030
And then?

159
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:31,470
I know but what did you say to him?

160
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:36,510
I accepted his confession.

161
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:39,270
How did you do that? Give me more details.

162
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:41,110
That's enough for you.

163
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,630
You don't have to know that much.

164
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,780
I'll ask Lomfon later.

165
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,110
Don't! You'd better get rid of that idea now.

166
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:49,990
Tien.

167
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:50,630
Yes?

168
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,110
I'm really happy for you.

169
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:58,510
I wish you to be happy about your own love, too.

170
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,950
Patts still haven't contacted you?

171
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,950
[No,] he hasn't.

172
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:11,110
He must really want to break up with me.

173
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:16,510
I don't think that your relationship just ended like that.

174
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,790
[For the past two years, you haven't talked to him,]

175
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:22,310
[he had tried to reach you so many times.]

176
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:25,790
It's not easy for you guys

177
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,310
falling in love.

178
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:34,070
I don't know what to do next.

179
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,430
But I know one thing.

180
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,150
I'm afraid of getting hurt.

181
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,230
[I'm afraid of being disappointed.]

182
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:47,110
I'm afraid that I can't accept his answer.

183
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:53,950
Tai. I don't want to you to be ruthless like before.

184
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:57,310
[The only thing to be ruthless is the noise in your head.]

185
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:01,150
[Feel whatever you want to feel.]

186
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:04,150
It's better than you just leave it like this.

187
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,230
[You still love him, right?]

188
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:11,110
[If you love him, you should tell him.]

189
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:13,110
Make it clear to him,

190
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:16,110
and you know how to do next.

191
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,430
Come on.

192
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:23,150
Now, my little brother is teaching me?

193
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:28,590
Yeah. Being born earlier doesn't mean knowing everything.

194
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:43,390
Tai. I have to go.

195
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:51,790
Go to get Patts, face-to-face.

196
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:56,870
Tien.

197
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:57,910
Yeah?

198
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,590
Study hard.

199
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,830
Don't treat me like a kid!

200
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,430
You are a kid.

201
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:06,470
Stop that. I have to go.

202
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,750
Bye!

203
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:15,910
I told Tai about us.

204
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,620
I want to kiss you again.

205
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:26,710
Are you crazy?

206
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:30,070
I knew that you like me.

207
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:33,070
But, you can't kiss me anywhere.

208
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,950
Let's go back to class.

209
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:46,990
I'm serious about that.

210
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:53,710
But, the more important thing is that

211
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:58,190
I can hold your hand like this.

212
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:04,190
And, I'll never let it go.

213
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:10,030
Stay with me forever, okay?

214
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,270
Go back to class.

215
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:46,590
[Now that it comes down to this, you're really not going to say a thing?]

216
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:50,150
[Even I do say something now, you won't even understand.]

217
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:53,750
[I can't understand just as you saying nothing.]

218
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:58,750
[As it comes down to this, you don't want to say something?]

219
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:03,870
[No matter what I'll say, You will not understand.]

220
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:07,790
[But I can't understand if you don't say anything.]

221
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:15,350
[It would best that you know nothing.]

222
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:31,270
[I didn't expect that you are so selfish.]

223
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:37,150
[That day you went to park with Lomfon,

224
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:39,310
Patts already knew.]

225
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:43,110
[But, he chose to believe you first, so he came here.]

226
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:47,470
[But I have something to tell you.]

227
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:51,230
[When you find the good love,

228
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:54,990
you know how to take care of it, right?]

229
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:12,750
What? Patts went to open a clinic in Chiang Mai?

230
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,870
Patts didn't tell you, right?

231
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,390
When did he go?

232
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,710
When will he be back?

233
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,950
It's been two weeks.

234
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:27,430
I'm not sure when he will be back.

235
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:31,590
And, I tried to ask where is his clinic.

236
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,830
He was not willing to tell me.

237
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,670
He's off social media.

238
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:37,670
He doesn't even reply messages.

239
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:42,350
Why did he go there all of the sudden?

240
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:55,470
He once went to the coffee shop to get you back.

241
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:59,790
But he saw you with Lomfon.

242
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:02,790
He thought you guys were dating.

243
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:11,830
But you were not, right?

244
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:18,110
No. That is a big misunderstanding.

245
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:21,790
I didn't even know that he was there.

246
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:27,710
Lomfon was just apologizing to me about all what had happened.

247
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:30,910
That's what I said.

248
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:34,710
Patts was misunderstanding.

249
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:37,950
I even told him to talk to you first.

250
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,430
I can understand you.

251
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:51,750
It's been a lot between you two.

252
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:56,270
You met at first,

253
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,390
then you were soul mates.

254
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,950
You fell in love with each other.

255
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:04,390
Then there came the third wheel.

256
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:06,670
Then out of a sudden,

257
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:10,710
your hearing-loss were gone.

258
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:18,110
You know, he liked you even before realizing you were his soul mate.

259
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:22,910
He told me he wanted to defy his destiny.

260
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:28,750
I'm wrong, too.

261
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:38,630
If I'd understood him and talked to him earlier,

262
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:42,430
it wouldn't have turned out like this.

263
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:47,310
As for destiny and soul-mate-stuff,

264
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:53,190
they like a trap in our relationship.

265
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:57,870
I think that are nothing.

266
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:06,830
But before he left, he left one message.

267
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:20,510
Patts, anytime when you'll be OK,

268
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:23,270
or get a new lover,

269
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,910
you got to tell us, alright?

270
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,550
That can't happen.

271
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:36,390
If it's not Saengtai, I won't love anyone.

272
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:43,190
I believe in soul mates.

273
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:47,470
Saengtai is my soul mate.

274
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,310
I got to go.

275
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:56,670
Okay.

276
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:59,110
Good luck.

277
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:13,070
Where are you going?

278
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,990
I'm going to get Patts.

279
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,990
We don't know where the clinic is.

280
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:25,310
And Chiang Mai is not a small place.

281
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,310
I know, Dream.

282
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:32,070
No matter what will happen, I must find him.

283
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:39,430
Dream. Thank you. Thank you so much.

284
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:43,630
Thank you for everything.

285
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:54,830
Patts, Tai's coming to you.

286
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,590
Sir, would you like anything else?

287
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:16,190
No. Thank you very much.

288
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:17,910
Yes, sir.

289
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:31,510
[How did you find me?]

290
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,910
[I can always find you.]

291
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:37,470
[Remember. We're soul mates.]

292
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:42,710
No matter what will happen, I got to find you.

293
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:30,910
Hello, Bow.

294
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,230
Tai!

295
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,030
Where are you?

296
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,230
I arrived here.

297
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,750
In a hotel.

298
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,750
Okay. Good. That's a relief.

299
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:44,950
I signed for your days off. Don't you worry about work.

300
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,830
Thank you very much.

301
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:51,550
Where are you going to find Dr. Patts?

302
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:57,430
I'll do some research and list all the clinics and vet hospitals nearby.

303
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:02,310
That's quite a work. When can you find him?

304
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:04,150
You don't even have a clue.

305
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:12,430
I must find him even if it means tons of work.

306
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:16,070
Okay. I'll leave you to it.

307
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:20,230
If there is anything that I can help, please tell me!

308
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,350
Alright?

309
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,710
Thank you, Bow.

310
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:12,750
[We don't know where the clinic is.]

311
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:16,070
[Chiang Mai is not a small place.]

312
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:19,550
[That's quite a work. When can you find him?]

313
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,270
[You don't even have a clue.]

314
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:25,710
[I must find him even if it means tons of work.]

315
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:37,390
Hey!

316
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:38,990
Whoops!

317
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,030
Hey!

318
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:45,470
Hey? What's wrong with you, little motor?

319
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:51,710
Why now!

320
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:54,790
Are you okay?

321
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:59,950
I don't know what's wrong with my motor. I can't get it going.

322
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:05,270
Oh, it runs out of gas.

323
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:08,350
Right, it runs out of gas...

324
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,270
Let me take a look at it.

325
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:14,710
Push it inside.

326
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:17,550
Cars are passing by here. It's dangerous.

327
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:20,390
Take your motorbike inside.

328
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:22,550
OK. Thank you so much.

329
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:36,950
Thank you.

330
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:40,030
Art, what's going on?

331
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:45,830
This guy ran out of gas.

332
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,710
I just took him here.

333
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:50,230
Really? Is he okay?

334
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:52,910
I'm totally okay. He helped me out.

335
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:54,790
This is my girlfriend, Pheung.

336
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:55,990
I'm Art.

337
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,470
Nice to meet you.

338
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:58,630
I'm Saengtai.

339
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:02,070
Where do you live, Saengtai?

340
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:06,390
It's quite far from here.

341
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:12,070
Oh, it's quite hard finding some gas station here.

342
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:14,030
And it's getting dark.

343
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:18,470
You can sleep-over here. Please feel free.

344
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:21,830
Yeah, stay here tonight, Saengtai.

345
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:23,710
We have a lot of room here.

346
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:27,630
Are you traveling alone?

347
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:32,390
Actually, I'm looking for a guy.

348
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:37,590
We misunderstood each other. I need to talk to him.

349
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:41,070
Is that your lover?

350
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:44,870
Yes.

351
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:47,150
Don't tell me...

352
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:50,150
You've been looking for him around the province?

353
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:51,630
Yes.

354
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,110
That's okay.

355
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:56,270
Let's have a dinner together.

356
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:58,070
Are you sure?

357
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:01,590
You seem hungry. Stay and eat something.

358
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:04,670
My girlfriend is a good cook.

359
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:09,230
OK. Thank you.

360
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,790
Is it good, Saengtai?

361
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,190
Very good, Phueng.

362
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:28,190
I think I'm good at this, but Art is better than me.

363
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:33,990
Complimeting me in front of other people like this makes me blush.

364
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:38,150
How long have you guys been together?

365
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:43,270
Almost ten years, since we were in school.

366
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:44,430
Wow.

367
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:51,830
[Isn't that Phueng?]

368
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:55,070
[The star in your school?]

369
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:58,030
[Why did she come to this?]

370
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:00,350
[She got into an accident.]

371
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:05,950
[She was in a surgery and the complication made her blind.]

372
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:09,430
[She was attractive to so many guys.]

373
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:10,700
[Really?]

374
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,870
[Yes.]

375
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:16,070
[Now, she only has Art.]

376
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,390
[Don't know if he's just nice or

377
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:19,910
he's close to her since they were children.]

378
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,750
[Don't listen to them, Phueng.]

379
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:46,430
[To be honest, I think just like what they said.]

380
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:49,990
[I'm happy that you concern me.]

381
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:55,830
[But each time I realize you do this because you're just acting nice,]

382
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:59,150
I feel so bad.]

383
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:04,470
[You don't have to take care of me.]

384
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:10,750
[Can I ask you to be my girlfriend?]

385
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:25,990
You guys are an adorable couple.

386
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:31,270
Oh, Saengtai, we also fight a lot.

387
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,990
Really? It doesn't seem like it.

388
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:40,990
When you get into a fight, what do you guys do?

389
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:45,630
Do you want to know how I make it up to her?

390
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:49,390
And you want to use the same method to your lover right?

391
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:55,540
You know, love can be hard.

392
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:57,830
Love can also be easy.

393
00:41:57,830 --> 00:42:00,830
There are so many details.

394
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:05,390
For me and Art, we listen to and understand each other.

395
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:08,140
It may be because I'm blind.

396
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:09,670
So, we listen.

397
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:12,430
We listen more, and speak less.

398
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:16,270
For some cases, if we speak more but listen less,

399
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:18,470
we don't hear the voice of each other.

400
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:21,470
Then, we don't understand each other.

401
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:26,030
We just listen each time when the problem comes.

402
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:31,750
Thank you, Phueng. Thank you very much.

403
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:35,830
Yeah. Let's dig in.

404
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:43,910
Is your lover good-looking?

405
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:53,030
Yes, he is.

406
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:27,550
I miss you, Patts.

407
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:52,750
Thank you guys. Thanks a lot for having me.

408
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:55,390
And I like this T-shirt.

409
00:43:56,190 --> 00:44:00,110
Have you traveled just for fun since you came here?

410
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:04,670
There's a market in the village.

411
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:06,990
Maybe you can go there and have fun.

412
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:09,830
Oh. That's interesting.

413
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:11,910
It's close to my hotel.

414
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:16,590
I'll go to get changed and go there.

415
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:20,030
I got to go now.

416
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:22,190
Come and visit us again.

417
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:23,190
Of course.

418
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:28,070
Bye bye.

419
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:28,990
Saengtai.

420
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,030
You can do this.

421
00:44:35,350 --> 00:44:36,470
See you.

422
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:28,030
Thank you!

423
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:46,990
Sir, can I get Nim back?

424
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:16,110
Patts.

425
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:00,390
You know what.

426
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:11,550
For these past days, I have been looking for you.

427
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:22,750
I'm so terrified that I can't see you again.

428
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:25,990
I'm terrified that you don't want to meet me anymore.

429
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:35,030
You don't have to say anything.

430
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:41,150
This time, please let me say it.

431
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:44,750
I am sorry.

432
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:47,270
I am sorry that I acted stupid.

433
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:48,710
I was selfish.

434
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:51,270
I was too emotional.

435
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:55,590
I didn't talk to you well. I let it slide until it's bad like now.

436
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,220
You know.

437
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:10,110
I had no idea that the sound of rain

438
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:14,470
could be so hurtful and lonely.

439
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:19,390
As for all of the soul mate things I was curious about,

440
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:21,230
I know that through myself,

441
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:22,750
Lomfon,

442
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:24,430
and my parents.

443
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:28,710
I know that now.

444
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:36,470
Love is about two people.

445
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:44,270
It doesn't need destiny to pave.

446
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:48,110
I don't care whether you are my soul mate or not.

447
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:54,110
The most important thing is our feelings.

448
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:07,110
Do you remember? There was a time when you asked me whether saying "I love you" is hard?

449
00:49:11,790 --> 00:49:13,750
No, Patts, it's not hard.

450
00:49:14,830 --> 00:49:17,590
So, I kept asking myself

451
00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:20,710
about how I fell about you.

452
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:28,590
My feelings have not changed at all.

453
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:39,990
I love you, Patts.

454
00:49:43,070 --> 00:49:45,750
I don't care if it rains or not.

455
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:48,670
I do love you no matter what happens.

456
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:06,110
Just try to use your heart listening to mine.

457
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:10,190
Just allow me to use my heart and tell you

458
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:12,270
I love you too.

459
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:17,630
♫That there's only you, and I keep saying I love you.♫

460
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:20,310
♫And, it belongs to you alone.♫

461
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:26,230
♫I'm still waiting for you to listen to my heart.♫

462
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:40,630
I promise. I will not let you go again.

463
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:02,190
♫That there's only you.♫

464
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:04,740
♫And, it belongs to you alone.♫

465
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:10,350
♫I'm still waiting for you to listen to my heart.♫

466
00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:15,630
♫Cause you’re my destiny.♫

467
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:28,190
In the end, the hearing-loss and soul-mate-stuff

468
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:31,830
are still questions that no one finds an answer.

469
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:39,470
Or in fact, no one chooses to find an answer anymore.

470
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:43,070
Because whether or not we know,

471
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:47,430
it doesn't have anything to do to the path that each person chooses.

472
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:56,470
And, we will never know whether the paths we choose are the best ones.

473
00:51:56,470 --> 00:51:59,230
At least, we get to choose our own paths,

474
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:01,590
instead of destiny determines for us.

475
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:08,230
There may be sadness, happiness, struggles,

476
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:09,990
or convenience.

477
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:12,950
But all in all,

478
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:15,590
it's the meaning of life.

479
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:21,190
I wish you all...

480
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:24,580
a happy journey of life.

481
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:35,990
Tai.

482
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:40,550
I warm up this for you.

483
00:53:00,030 --> 00:53:03,660
♫The only thing I do is thinking of you.♫

484
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:07,270
♫All night, insomnia.♫

485
00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:09,430
♫Being like this,♫

486
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:11,350
♫feeling like this,♫

487
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:15,220
♫Is it what's called love? ♫

488
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:19,150
♫Is it only me having insomnia? ♫

489
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:22,630
♫Thinking of us all night.♫

490
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:25,950
♫Would you miss me just a little? ♫

491
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:31,190
♫I struggle to sleep, just to miss you so much.♫

492
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:39,030
♫Is this the real love? Is this the real love?♫

493
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:46,940
♫Is this the real love? Is this the real love?♫

494
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:56,820
I'm hungry. Shall we go to eat?

495
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:58,070
What do you want to eat?

496
00:53:58,070 --> 00:53:59,270
Jay Ngor?

497
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:02,230
I want some rice noodles.

498
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:04,750
I want Jay Ngor.

499
00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:10,150
-Can we go to Jay Ngor?
-Okay. Okay.

500
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:15,310
It's going to rain.

501
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:19,110
I forgot my umbrella in the classroom. I'll get it.

502
00:54:19,110 --> 00:54:20,140
You wait here.

503
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:23,150
Hurry. I'm starving!

504
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:48,350
I'm sorry. Can you hear me?

505
00:54:49,990 --> 00:54:51,150
Soul mate.

506
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:53,230
Seriously?
