1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:21,670
Where's the place in the photo?

3
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:23,430
Doi Mae Pliang, in Chiang Mai.

4
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,710
Is it the mountain that rains all year round?

5
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,030
I would love for you to go to Doi Mae Pliang.

6
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,310
The VVC camp.

7
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,550
The camp got vets.

8
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,310
And the villagers.

9
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,710
My name is Kung.

10
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,350
That lady is something.

11
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:46,070
I got the key. Shall we go to our room?

12
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,510
Tai, why are you here?

13
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,950
I want to ask you first.

14
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:31,350
I come with Lomfon for a school project.

15
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,030
So what about you?

16
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,470
Bow and I are doing a research for an article.

17
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,150
In the VVC?

18
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,110
Yes.

19
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:43,150
The pet hospital of my soul mate

20
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,790
arranges this camp.

21
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,590
Didn't you say you didn't know anyone?

22
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,750
Lomfon, his soul mate is here!

23
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,430
So, your soul mate is here?

24
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,990
Yes. You'll see him later.

25
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,310
Soul mate...

26
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,030
Can I do something for you?

27
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:28,550
Tai, that's him, right?

28
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,990
Yes. He is my soul mate.

29
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,550
His name is Patts.

30
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,750
Patts.

31
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:38,590
This is my brother, Saengtien.

32
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,790
And, that's my brother's friend, Lomfon.

33
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:50,710
Patts.

34
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,590
Yes.

35
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,390
Could you allow me to confirm something?

36
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:57,390
You are really Tai's soul mate, right?

37
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,430
Yeah.

38
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:04,150
You know what? I really want to see you!

39
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,950
Hey! Where are you going?

40
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:17,910
You and I need to check in. Don't waste the time.

41
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,230
Excuse me.

42
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,430
Why is he in such a hurry?

43
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,790
I'll catch you later. See you.

44
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:27,820
See you.

45
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:28,990
Lomfon!

46
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,110
Lomfon!

47
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,790
Let's go to our room.

48
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:36,470
OK.

49
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,390
Let me hold that for you.

50
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,230
Thank you.

51
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,950
Which side would you like?

52
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:29,110
This side, thanks.

53
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,230
Umm...

54
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,830
What's up?

55
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:50,630
We haven't been together for a month.

56
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:58,830
The last time we were together,

57
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,230
we were…

58
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:30,630
I'll go to check the kitchen.

59
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,990
I heard they are short of hands.

60
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,630
See you.

61
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,550
This side's mine!

62
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,430
Okay.

63
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,750
Tien, give me the camera.

64
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,870
Hang on.

65
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,790
Be careful.

66
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,950
Where did you get this keychain?

67
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:33,870
Hey!

68
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,909
What's wrong with you?

69
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:38,190
This chain is important to me.

70
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,950
You're so heavy-handed.

71
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:00,990
It looks familiar to me.

72
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,950
It hangs the key to my dorm.

73
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,350
How could you haven't seen it?

74
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,870
Not like that.

75
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:10,070
I think I've seen someone else used this kind of keychain.

76
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,220
So who's that?

77
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,190
Like I said,

78
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:35,870
we are reciprocal to each other here.

79
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:38,220
We help each other out.

80
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:43,309
So how about we go to work now.

81
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:46,190
Let's go.

82
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:59,990
So, did you get your roommate?

83
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:04,870
Yes, but I got the bad ass of this camp.

84
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,710
The bad ass?

85
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:13,470
Hello, Bow!

86
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:17,870
Okay, guys. Let’s get started on our favorite kitchen work.

87
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:20,750
Bow, and...

88
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,190
Saengtai.

89
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,990
Saengtai? What a great name?

90
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,270
It's unique.

91
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:34,940
I want to have the same name with you. So I'd go with Saengkung.

92
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:38,630
Alright, Saengkung!

93
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:43,510
Yes, Bow!

94
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,990
If you get some problems, please let me know.

95
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:52,670
Bow, Saengtai, I'm looking forward to tasting your cooking.

96
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,470
So, who's your roommate?

97
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:03,470
Don't you know yet?

98
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,910
Saengkung!

99
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,710
Look at her.

100
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,230
Are you okay, Kung?

101
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,710
I'm going to faint.

102
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:18,950
She is definitely a bad ass.

103
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,430
But you two might hit it off.

104
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,590
Why do you still look unhappy?

105
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:24,030
Stop that, Saengtai!

106
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:26,950
Listen! At first, I also thought it would be OK.

107
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:30,870
But, when I got into the room and spotted a hot guy,

108
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,470
a very hot guy,

109
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,910
I thought I'd take the chance and talk to him.

110
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:39,190
And then the Saengkung...

111
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:43,550
got in front of me and pounced to him a female tiger!

112
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:46,950
I was the one who supposed to talk to that guy!

113
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:49,950
But she always get in my way.

114
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:54,190
I swear to God

115
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:57,190
that I must win this time.

116
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,910
Yeah, you guys are a perfect match.

117
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:15,510
Let's change the topic before I mess up this dish.

118
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,470
Okay.

119
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,990
Oh god, my head.

120
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,710
I really have a headache.

121
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,150
Ugh!

122
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,310
Let's continue our cooking.

123
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:31,740
Why are these beans broken?

124
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,670
Oh, now you are asking.

125
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,830
-What? 
-Look.

126
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,590
Come on!

127
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:44,470
I think I've seen someone else used this kind of keychain.

128
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,350
So who's that?

129
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,350
I can't remember.

130
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:12,350
Why are you so curious about this?

131
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,270
That's none of your business.

132
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:18,870
The owner of this keychain saved my life.

133
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:21,430
I didn't see his face clearly.

134
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,460
But I treated him as my first love.

135
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,190
First love?

136
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:30,590
You're weird person. You even don't know whom you fall in love with.

137
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,790
It's important to see the person's face, you know?

138
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:36,470
But what about the people who have hearing loss?

139
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,710
The camera's set. Let's go!

140
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:46,750
Talking to you is such a waste of time.

141
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,750
Talking to you is such a waste of good mood.

142
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:03,990
Kung! You bitch!

143
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:14,550
Here, put it right here.

144
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:17,820
You shoot from this angle.

145
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,030
Try to shoot the details of their actions.

146
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:23,030
I will edit the video footage into the part where they are cooking.

147
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:01,270
Make me look good in the photo, okay?

148
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,750
Okay.

149
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,070
I'll give you the first taste.

150
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:15,790
(Singing) ♫The flowers are on the hill.♫

151
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,750
Hey you, look.

152
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,390
Zoom it.

153
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,710
That's adorable, right?

154
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,870
Leave me alone.

155
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:51,710
Oh.

156
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,550
Let's go. We'll be late.

157
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,150
Go. Push it.

158
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,070
You're helping me, right?

159
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:03,430
I am helping you.

160
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,670
Food is here!

161
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,150
Thanks for your hard work.

162
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,470
Here's some fruit.

163
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,030
Hey, Patts.

164
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:28,030
I just realize your boyfriend has a brother.

165
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,590
He's not his boyfriend yet.

166
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,310
You should get it right.

167
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:36,350
They are soul mates in a romantic relationship.

168
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:43,550
You are Lomfon, right?

169
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:44,660
Yes.

170
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:47,830
If you want some further information,

171
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:48,990
interview villagers,

172
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,310
or take photos of somewhere,

173
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:53,310
please tell me. I'll help you out.

174
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,910
Thank you.

175
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:04,310
Patts, eat your food.

176
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:06,590
Stop staring at your boy.

177
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,190
I'm waiting for him.

178
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:11,990
You're working here, not taking care of your boyfriend.

179
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,670
(Singing)♫ He is not his boyfriend yet.♫

180
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,910
Here we go again...

181
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,550
Patts, you should eat now.

182
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:26,350
We'll have a meeting with volunteers, and then with villagers at nine.

183
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,870
It's almost time.

184
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,950
Huh? From 9 am to 6 pm?

185
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:33,950
Yes. We also need to be there earlier.

186
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:37,230
I feel that Fluke and Ruj make jokes on us.

187
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,990
Will this be our daily routine?

188
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:42,230
This is even not a big deal.

189
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:44,910
Tomorrow, we will go to the village on the hill tomorrow.

190
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:45,580
What?

191
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:48,590
On the hill? That's so hard.

192
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:54,630
I'm starving.

193
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,910
Can I join you?

194
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,590
Sure!

195
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,830
Are you done with all?

196
00:16:58,830 --> 00:16:59,750
Yes.

197
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:07,470
They all look delicious.

198
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,829
This one looks good.

199
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,510
My brother!

200
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:23,030
Your little brother is right here. Don't you want to say hi?

201
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,630
Are you even close to them now?

202
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:25,630
Don't you dare speak that loud.

203
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:30,710
They are like my brother-in-law's friends.

204
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:33,830
Anyway, you will take care of me, right?

205
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:38,590
He's not your brother-in-law. You are not making any sense.

206
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:46,350
Please excuse me. I'm full.

207
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:52,750
Lomfon!

208
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,670
Alright. We need to hurry up too.

209
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,590
The meeting, remember?

210
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:07,830
Seriously? I didn't eat my fruit yet.

211
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:10,070
Shut up. We are the seniors in the camp.

212
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:12,030
It looks juicy!

213
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,150
Why don't you eat, Patts?

214
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:18,350
I was waiting for you.

215
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,710
But you'll have a meeting.

216
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:24,030
I told him. He doesn't listen to me.

217
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:28,790
Never mind. I want to have my meal with you.

218
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,430
I just want you to be here with me.

219
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,670
Eat! Now!

220
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,070
Okay.

221
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,030
Quickly.

222
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,990
Lomfon!

223
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,070
Lomfon!

224
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,030
What do you want?

225
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:07,070
You said something bad and walked away just like that?

226
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:09,630
It was you talking nonsense about your brother and Patts.

227
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,780
Have you ever asked them how they feel?

228
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:15,790
Though they are seeing each other, they might not like somebody to mention it.

229
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:18,550
That's not what you are thinking about.

230
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,470
I warn you now.

231
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,830
Think twice before you do something.

232
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,030
My brother and Patts are soul mates.

233
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:32,470
I won't let you get into their relationship.

234
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:36,550
You got me wrong.

235
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,870
Hey, you, aren't you feeling well?

236
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,670
-Where did you not feel well?
-Right here.

237
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,950
Please take notes and follow me.

238
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,790
Its name is Plaboo?

239
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,710
Yes.

240
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:12,550
It got a wound on the leg, right?

241
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,750
Did it get bandaged it well?

242
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,550
Okay.

243
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:22,910
Gently, gently, please.

244
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,150
Please cherish this plate.

245
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:29,590
-Be gentle to it.
 -Exactly.

246
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,910
Please let me help you.

247
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:36,860
Like this way.

248
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,870
Gently wash it.

249
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,910
I took its temperature.

250
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:50,030
It got a fever. Look. It's shivering.

251
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:53,910
But, this one is healthy. I'll give it another check.

252
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,070
Good cat.

253
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:07,510
We're done. Good kitty.

254
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,310
Okay.

255
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:17,110
I treated its wound. There are some medicine in the bag.

256
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,270
-Please remember to get it the medicine.
-OK.

257
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,830
Thank you.

258
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,350
Goodbye.

259
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:27,030
Let me get you a check-up.

260
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:35,430
This one is strong.

261
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:45,790
Patts.

262
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:46,670
Yes?

263
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,870
Can I interview you?

264
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:49,910
Sure.

265
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:53,350
Do we have to prepare that much?

266
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,310
The medical supplies?

267
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,350
Yes.

268
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,710
Of course.

269
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:01,590
When we arrange an activity, we can't really assume the concrete number of animals.

270
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:04,030
Let alone the quantity of the sick pets.

271
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,550
We do have to prepare this much.

272
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,550
At least, it's better to...

273
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:09,310
Better to have more than less.

274
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:14,310
Patts, please continue writing.

275
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,070
Oh.

276
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,510
You look sharp this way.

277
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,710
OK. OK.

278
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:26,350
Please cherish these plates. They're expensive.

279
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,230
Wash it gently, please.

280
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:31,910
Step back! It's better to wash them like this way.

281
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,340
Bow.

282
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:36,910
I think...

283
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:41,430
Bow, you must wash it gently.

284
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:44,950
You get to wash it slightly.

285
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:47,630
I think...

286
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:51,300
You can't wash them clean that way.

287
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,750
Please wash them like this, Bow.

288
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,190
We're running out of time!

289
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:57,110
I think you cannot, please! Bow!

290
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:59,190
No! Saengkung!

291
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:01,710
-We should washing them fast! 
-Bow!

292
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:02,470
No, please.

293
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,990
It's just dish-washing!

294
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,390
Bow!

295
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,830
Bow!

296
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:11,430
Everywhere is wet, Bow.

297
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,030
You got that!

298
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,990
Ugh!

299
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:25,470
(Together) Thank you.

300
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:29,110
-Safe back home. 
-Bye bye.

301
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:38,390
See you.

302
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:45,230
-See you. 
-Bye bye.

303
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:49,950
Bye bye.

304
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:21,630
Please put it here.

305
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,790
Thank you.

306
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,110
Wow.

307
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:31,030
Bow.

308
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:33,550
Saengtai.

309
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:35,830
Can't I have that one?

310
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:36,950
Just drink yours.

311
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:40,030
Okay. Thank you.

312
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:48,270
This work is quite tiring. Don't you think?

313
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:51,390
But, I think it's fun.

314
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:52,270
Yeah.

315
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:56,150
After I graduated, I have never experienced something fun like this.

316
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:58,470
You know that I hate crowds.

317
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:03,910
But I see you smiling all the time.

318
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:07,190
-(Laughing) La la la
 -Stop that!

319
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,710
Alright.

320
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:16,670
Tai.

321
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:21,190
Let me ask you something.

322
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:26,710
When will you set your relationship with Dr. Patts?

323
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:33,510
I have no idea about that.

324
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:36,950
It's not entirely up to me.

325
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:40,150
Why do you ask that?

326
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:45,270
Well, I got something in my mind.

327
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:48,180
How should I put this?

328
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:54,470
I feel like you guys are a perfect match.

329
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:58,630
I want you to be happy with him.

330
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:06,190
I know that the current status doesn't matter.

331
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:10,510
But what makes it different is that, it makes clear

332
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,430
that you guys are a couple

333
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:15,030
to others.

334
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,510
To others?

335
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,110
Yeah.

336
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,950
Seriously.

337
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:22,420
I can see from his gaze and words.

338
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:25,150
Lomfon likes you!

339
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,710
Bow, don't you say that again.

340
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:34,070
I can feel that Dr. Patts has the same idea.

341
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,790
I'm a 100% sure.

342
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,990
Because I am an observant person.

343
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,510
Uh?

344
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:48,190
Tai, I know I should not say this.

345
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:50,780
But you are my close friend.

346
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:58,750
I don't want someone else interfere with you two.

347
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:06,470
I really support you guys, you know.

348
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:11,750
Really.

349
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:13,990
I'm rooting for you. OK?

350
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:59,030
How long do you want to shoot?

351
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:05,510
Half an hour. I set the timer to shoot.

352
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,220
What's wrong?

353
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,950
Nothing.

354
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,870
You're acting weird.

355
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:38,110
Why do you have to be so possessive of your brother?

356
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,510
I'm not.

357
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,830
If not, why are you mad at me?

358
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:48,750
If you don't think the way exactly as what you said,

359
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,150
then we'll be cool.

360
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:52,830
So, you are really mad at me?

361
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:53,910
Yes.

362
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:58,670
OK. I'm sorry.

363
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:19,390
Listen. I just don't believe in soul mates.

364
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:26,860
Don't you think it's strange that the universe could control our destiny since we were born?

365
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,630
It's hard to say.

366
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:39,750
The one who has hearing loss can hear only one voice when it rains.

367
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:45,990
If that's not a destiny, then what is?

368
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:48,270
Coincidence?

369
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:50,070
Huh?

370
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:53,070
A situation that just randomly happens.

371
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:56,390
That's not destiny.

372
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:59,390
No one can ever get your love life fixed into a certain way, right?

373
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:02,190
Only you can control it..

374
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,510
You can't compare them in that way.

375
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:19,110
If someone can hear your voice when it rains,

376
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:24,070
and you get exactly that one's voice,

377
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:27,950
and if the hearing loss guy lacks a soul mate,

378
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:33,230
his world will be filled with emptiness.

379
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:36,470
You are thinking with your emotions.

380
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:42,510
There are things that don't have to make so much sense.

381
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:45,030
We're talking about love.

382
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:50,510
You're talking like you've ever been in love.

383
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,630
Stop laughing.

384
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,630
Sorry.

385
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,550
What are you doing?

386
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:31,430
You look so cool just now.

387
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:34,510
Why didn't you ask first?

388
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:37,940
I got my own handsome angle, you know?

389
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:40,110
The pose was the best.

390
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:42,710
You'll act weird if you know that I'm shooting you.

391
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:46,230
OK. Then you are the only not-weird-guy.

392
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:50,030
Mocking me now, huh?

393
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:10,350
How long has it shot?

394
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:13,430
Not ten minutes yet.

395
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,910
I'll take a nap then.

396
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:19,710
Go ahead. I'll wake you up when time's up.

397
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,630
Lomfon.

398
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:01,030
Lomfon!

399
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:01,630
What's wrong?

400
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:02,910
Look.

401
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:14,070
So beautiful.

402
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:17,510
It is beautiful.

403
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:20,870
I'm sorry.

404
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:23,949
Did I wake you?

405
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,150
No.

406
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:31,389
I couldn't sleep.

407
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:36,790
My muscles are sore.

408
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:40,190
Too much work, I guess.

409
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:47,310
How about I give you a massage?

410
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,190
You can do that?

411
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:54,030
Yeah. I used to do it for my father.

412
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:58,150
Then, please be my masseur.

413
00:34:59,030 --> 00:34:59,990
OK.

414
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:08,220
May I?

415
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:16,270
Here we go.

416
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:17,460
Okay.

417
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:23,590
That's so good.

418
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,030
Why are you staring at me?

419
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:49,030
I don't know if you know this.

420
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:52,030
Now, you're so cute.

421
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:30,870
You teased me first.

422
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,510
I'm not ready.

423
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,470
Give me more time, OK?

424
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:47,670
Can I help you, then?

425
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:49,230
Tai.

426
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:05,460
Are you sure about doing this?

427
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:50,230
[I go to work.]

428
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:54,030
[I see you sleep tight so I don't want to wake you up.]

429
00:41:54,510 --> 00:42:00,470
[P.S. I don't have to work at the last day in the camp.]

430
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:03,470
[Let's go up on Doi Mae Pliang together that day.]

431
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:09,470
Saengtai.

432
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:15,470
What are you looking at?

433
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:17,460
Who's that girl?

434
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:19,430
She's very cute.

435
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:21,510
I didn't see her yesterday.

436
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:24,430
Her name is Nara, I think.

437
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:26,990
She just arrived here this morning.

438
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:40,990
Bow. Saengtai.

439
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:43,830
Come here and give me a hand.

440
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:45,990
I get some work for you.

441
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:51,470
Nara. I get this guy to help you.

442
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:53,910
I told that to him.

443
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:55,470
OK. Go ahead.

444
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:56,510
We are so busy today.

445
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:57,230
-Bow.
 -Yes.

446
00:43:57,230 --> 00:43:58,070
Yes?

447
00:43:58,070 --> 00:43:59,670
Could you help me pick the vegetables?

448
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:00,910
No problem.

449
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:02,350
Here you go.

450
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:03,070
OK.

451
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:07,460
I am Nara.

452
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:08,870
What's your name?

453
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:10,430
Saengtai.

454
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:12,350
Saengtai!

455
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:14,790
What a nice name.

456
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:17,540
It reminds me of aurora.

457
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:28,310
Yours are cute, too.

458
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:30,030
Me?

459
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:32,390
I mean your name.

460
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:33,670
Oh.

461
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:49,150
I prepared all of these but I'm not sure whether that's enough.

462
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:52,790
Can you help me check it out?

463
00:44:56,230 --> 00:45:00,030
I think these are enough.

464
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:03,630
Well, shall we start then?

465
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:04,870
Alright.

466
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:08,790
They're cute, aren't they, Bow?

467
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:10,750
They're getting along so quickly.

468
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:14,150
Bangkok people are so cute, right?

469
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:22,230
That's weird. Tai usually get along with others very slowly.

470
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:29,550
Bow, I'll  get the car. I'll leave you to this, OK?

471
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:30,550
Of course.

472
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:32,110
Take care of Bow, you all.

473
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:34,070
Yes.

474
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:39,230
What's that?

475
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:40,710
An umbrella.

476
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:42,030
Why you do this?

477
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,990
To make sure you look great.

478
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:04,990
The bento looks cute.

479
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:10,980
Really? I made it for my ex boyfriend.

480
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:14,340
Your ex boyfriend?

481
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:20,550
Yeah. He's also a vet and he's in this camp.

482
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:26,100
Once I heard that, I came here to make up with him.

483
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:32,030
But, I've been breaking up with him for a long time.

484
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:37,550
It's weird I can still remember every detail about him,

485
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:39,950
about what he likes and dislikes.

486
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:43,230
The omelette must not be cooked with so much oil.

487
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:46,510
He also likes flower-shaped carrots like this.

488
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:58,430
I'm sure you'll make up with him.

489
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:03,950
I'm relieved as you say so.

490
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:05,350
Thank you.

491
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:06,220
Not at all.

492
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:14,190
Nara.

493
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:18,950
What's the name of your ex?

494
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:21,140
Maybe I know him.

495
00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:23,270
Everybody!

496
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:24,950
The car is here!

497
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:25,550
Let's go!

498
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:26,670
OK.

499
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:29,390
Let's go. Help each other with the stuff.

500
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:31,190
We need to go now.

501
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:32,550
All good?

502
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:33,630
All good.

503
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:42,750
Food is here.

504
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:47,590
Food is here. Come and eat, everyone!

505
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:49,070
Please come here.

506
00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:50,150
Bow.

507
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:51,310
Yes.

508
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:53,270
Food is here.

509
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:55,710
Please come and eat.

510
00:47:56,070 --> 00:47:57,790
Take your food.

511
00:47:57,790 --> 00:47:58,910
It's so hot today,

512
00:47:58,910 --> 00:47:59,710
right?

513
00:48:05,910 --> 00:48:09,230
Wow. Is this the bento with fried eggs?

514
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:10,790
Yes.

515
00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:12,430
Wow.

516
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:21,550
Tien!

517
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:26,430
Hey, my brother.

518
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:28,780
Stop! It's not yours.

519
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:31,550
I'm your little brother!

520
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:34,430
I already knew that.

521
00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:35,950
Have you seen Patts?

522
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:38,310
He's not done yet, I guess.

523
00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:41,310
I heard he went to the village for some cases.

524
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:43,630
OK.

525
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:46,030
OK. OK. OK.

526
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:48,350
Your food is there.

527
00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:49,910
The brown box.

528
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:52,870
It's not a special one.

529
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:55,190
Because I don't care.

530
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:11,510
Just leave them alone.

531
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:12,510
Yeah.

532
00:49:13,830 --> 00:49:15,470
Saengtai.

533
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:17,630
Hey, did you have your meal?

534
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:18,630
Not yet.

535
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:20,550
Let's go eat with us.

536
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:22,510
Yeah? Let's go.

537
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:24,070
Let's go and eat.

538
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:24,950
Yeah.

539
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:26,670
Patts is still working.

540
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:27,990
It'll take for a while.

541
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:30,070
I'm not hungry.

542
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:30,670
Alright.

543
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:31,630
Let's go.

544
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:34,310
Just eat a bit first. Then you can get to Patts later.

545
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:36,150
Go, go.

546
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:41,310
I'm starving. Let's have some food.

547
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:46,190
Saengtai, Patts is...

548
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:51,990
Over there?

549
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:53,830
Thank you.

550
00:49:58,710 --> 00:50:01,710
(Singing) I'm starving.

551
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:14,470
Anyway, they will find it out.

552
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:14,390
Tai's gone.

553
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:15,030
What?

554
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:16,550
Let's go and check the back of the camp.

555
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:18,910
I'll check the room.

556
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:22,070
Tai went to Doi Mae Pliang.

557
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:24,110
Why didn't I think of that!

558
00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:24,990
