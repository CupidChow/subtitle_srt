1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,390
Where did you get that keychain?

3
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:27,190
Did you save a kid who almost got hit by a car two years ago?

4
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,270
I am your soul mate, too.

5
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,590
This fucking destiny, I don't want it anymore!

6
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,710
[Tai.]

7
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:21,710
[Tai.]

8
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,870
[Please talk to me.]

9
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:27,070
[I don't know what the fuck is happening with our soul mate thing.]

10
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,110
[And, I don't really care.]

11
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,070
[Me and him,]

12
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,190
[who do you choose?]

13
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,190
[Patts, I can't understand what are you asking.]

14
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:36,350
[This question is always in my head.]

15
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,310
You have already know that I love you so much.

16
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,660
Why did you lie to me today?

17
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,630
I'm sorry!

18
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,829
Do you believe in our relationship?

19
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,510
Say it! Say that you choose me!

20
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:45,950
What do you want me to do so you can love me?

21
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,220
I don't know what to do now!

22
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,190
Screw you!

23
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,510
Let's break up.

24
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,230
Fuck!

25
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,870
Fuck!

26
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,710
Damn!

27
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,310
Damn!

28
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,630
For this semester,

29
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,670
I will give you another assignment.

30
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,070
Since last time you all did a very good job,

31
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,750
this time, I'll let you team up freely.

32
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,870
You can also do it independently if you wish.

33
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,829
I don't mind.

34
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:50,829
But the topic is,

35
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,230
"The message from your heart".

36
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,710
You are all film majors,

37
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,790
and finding yourselves may be challenging for you.

38
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:03,630
There are so many films telling love stories.

39
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:09,110
But you know what, why can't we get enough of it?

40
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:13,750
That's because, every film that we've watched

41
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,269
tells a different love story.

42
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:19,589
Love can be easily conveyed to the audience,

43
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:22,230
because everyone knows what love is.

44
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:26,790
I want you all to get your own story.

45
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,910
Breaking through the stunning visual effects

46
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,550
created by macro and grand narratives.

47
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,470
And come back to your true feelings.

48
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,590
Tell your story what you really want to tell.

49
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:43,510
So next, everyone forms your team and thinks about your topic.

50
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,830
Remember to hand over your topics to my office.

51
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,510
See you next class.

52
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,700
Thank you.

53
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:55,830
Look at that. I'm pumped!

54
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,870
Yeah.

55
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,470
Wit, wanna team up with me again?

56
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,470
Of course.

57
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,350
That's my buddy!

58
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,350
You leave me alone again?

59
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:09,710
How come? You can team up with Tien.

60
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,910
Anyway, Jessada and I do work so well.

61
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:13,590
Do we, bro?

62
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,750
Right, bro.

63
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,670
How can I pair up with Tien?

64
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,110
He must be with Lomfon.

65
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,190
Look at their last work.

66
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,190
That was so great.

67
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,790
Did you cheat?

68
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,190
I'll be your partner, Ton.

69
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,190
I don't want to work with him anymore.

70
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,510
I don't want to talk to him.

71
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,580
Tien!

72
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:10,550
That's weird. Hearing loss can be just gone like that?

73
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:17,030
What a shame. I just got the bright Saengtai back.

74
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:19,270
Now you become the sad Saengtai again.

75
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,390
Tai.

76
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,430
Do you want to talk to Dr. Patts again?

77
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,870
No need really.

78
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:52,550
He hasn't contacted with me the whole week.

79
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,110
Things are already clear.

80
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:04,150
And... I don't want to get hurt by love again.

81
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:09,390
But Patts is your soul mate...

82
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,310
Bow.

83
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:15,070
Soul mate is not real.

84
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:22,910
I should believe that  since my parents divorced.

85
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:44,030
Does the sound of rain make us feel so lonely?

86
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,950
What's wrong with him now?

87
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,950
He saw Saengtai at the bus stop.

88
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,510
But, he didn't get off and chat with him.

89
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,030
He drove passed just like that.

90
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:58,270
But I think that's normal. He even doesn't have the guts to text Saengtai.

91
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:08,540
Patts. Why don't you talk to Tai?

92
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:20,990
I don't know. He may not want to talk to me.

93
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:23,990
You broke up with him like that, so...

94
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:35,830
So do you still love him? For real.

95
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:44,310
Then, you should talk to him.

96
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:48,910
I do want to, but last time...

97
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,310
I understand Saengtai.

98
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:58,630
He might have a lot on his mind at that time.

99
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:01,900
And each time, you were pretty rough for him.

100
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,310
You were so mad at the first time.

101
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,670
And so drunk the second time.

102
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,430
Try to have a good talk with him again.

103
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:17,430
I agree with Dream. I believe that Tai still loves you, too.

104
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:23,470
(Singing) Love, love you...

105
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,060
-Shut up.
 -To lighten the mood.

106
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:32,750
Patts, it's not easy for you to be together from the beginning.

107
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,710
You've been through a lot together.

108
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,110
And this time,

109
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,630
you got to get through, too.

110
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,910
Thank you.

111
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,430
Go and get him back.

112
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,350
Are you okay?

113
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,230
Tien!

114
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,510
Tien!

115
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,950
Are you OK?

116
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,310
I'm not OK.

117
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,910
I like Lomfon.

118
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:55,230
I never thought of that.

119
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:59,510
I didn't expect that to be true.

120
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,150
I'm Sorry.

121
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,630
For what?

122
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,470
You haven't done anything.

123
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:19,190
But Lomfon likes you,

124
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,270
not me.

125
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,910
I still want to say sorry.

126
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:35,470
I sort of made you feel bad.

127
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:41,070
I take the apology and this cup.

128
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:01,990
How have you been after that day?

129
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,150
I don't know.

130
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,950
That's complicated.

131
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:19,870
Anyway, Patts and I broke up.

132
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,790
Wow. What a bad news.

133
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,230
Did you fight?

134
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,550
Almost.

135
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,870
That's a week ago.

136
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,750
You didn't tell me about that.

137
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:54,270
Guess what? Since then, Patts and I haven't talked.

138
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:06,790
Guess what? Patts already knew

139
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,150
that you went to park with Lom.

140
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:16,670
But, he chose to believe you first, and he came here to get you.

141
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,710
Then, he got me.

142
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:23,390
As he didn't get you here,

143
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:27,310
he decided to go to that park.

144
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,350
He drove freaking fast.

145
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,950
Thank you for telling me.

146
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,750
No problem. I just thought that you should know.

147
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,790
But that can't help anything.

148
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:56,510
I just have to take that.

149
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,790
I just need to live in reality.

150
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:12,710
Yeah, maybe it's the best that we can do now.

151
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:18,630
Thank you for always been on my left.

152
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:24,070
Thank you for always been on my right.

153
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,750
We're blood.

154
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,150
Tai...

155
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:51,270
You and I haven't been through like this for so long.

156
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,390
Come on, Tien.

157
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,510
It's a good thing.

158
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,550
You do cry it out, my big brother?

159
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,830
I want to cry with you.

160
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:28,390
Hey, Lomfon.

161
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,430
Hello, Saengtai.

162
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,470
What's up?

163
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:43,670
Well... I own you an apology.

164
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:51,710
Because of me, you and Patts got a fight.

165
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,070
Never mind.

166
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:59,670
I'm not angry with you.

167
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:05,869
I heard what you said that day.

168
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:15,829
I want to say sorry, too.

169
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,109
But why, Tai?

170
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:21,869
You didn't do something wrong.

171
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:26,670
I'm sorry that I cannot accept your feeling towards me.

172
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:36,870
But, please still be my good friend.

173
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:47,990
Actually, I just understand myself, too.

174
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:57,110
After... I kissed you,

175
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:04,310
I realized that

176
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:10,030
my feelings for you is not love.

177
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:15,710
That's only about your impression on me.

178
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:21,870
That's about your personality. And you saved my life.

179
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:34,670
All that let me know who I really love.

180
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:41,430
You don't have to tell me that. Tell your love to that one.

181
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:47,230
I'm so glad that you got your true love.

182
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:53,190
It's like that you have grown up to next level.

183
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:59,230
Someone takes a long time, like me.

184
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:05,430
But eventually, everyone learns and grows in love.

185
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,030
What are you laughing at?

186
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,430
Myself.

187
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,270
I talked good to others.

188
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,990
But, I'm still struggling myself.

189
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:32,390
If there's nothing else, I got to go.

190
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,950
OK.

191
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,070
Tai.

192
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,110
Yes?

193
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:49,270
In any case, thank you very much.

194
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:55,150
Not at all. I got your back.

195
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:40,870
If you encounter any difficulty, you can come to me.

196
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,550
I know all of his things.

197
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,990
OK.

198
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,780
Thank you.

199
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:52,470
See you.

200
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:53,950
Bye.

201
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:41,790
Are you sure about resigning?

202
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,190
Yeah.

203
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:57,830
You know what? If you go there, you'll start all over again.

204
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:03,910
That's exactly what I want.

205
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,910
To be all alone?

206
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:14,950
Patts, we don't want to stop you.

207
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:21,470
We just want to make sure that your decision is not impulsive.

208
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,030
We understand the relationship

209
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,430
between you and Saengtai.

210
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,550
But, if you are acting on your emotion this time,

211
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,350
we will disagree.

212
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:46,790
I know that I'm sort of acting on my emotions.

213
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:54,150
But, I've thought about resigning for a long time.

214
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,510
Sometimes, I think...

215
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:05,070
If Saengtai and I are not soul mates,

216
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:09,510
we'll never be together.

217
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,390
Don't say that.

218
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:27,870
Don't cry.

219
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,430
-We'll never be together.
 -Don't say that.

220
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:43,630
I understand. Sometimes, it will take time.

221
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,670
I love you guys so much.

222
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,510
I really love you guys.

223
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:53,790
I know.

224
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,420
Is it good?

225
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,590
OK. You are so handsome.

226
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:39,590
Welcome.

227
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,670
It's serious.

228
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:43,670
Huh?

229
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,030
Really?

230
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,150
Tai!

231
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,860
Sweetie, let's take a photo.

232
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:09,870
Thank you. See you at the banquet.

233
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:11,310
Please enjoy yourselves.

234
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:17,990
How are you, handsome bros?

235
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,310
Not bad, bro.

236
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,510
I talked to them.

237
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:24,750
-I started dressing up at 5. 
-Just kidding.

238
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,190
Have you eaten?

239
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:30,150
Go to get your food over there.

240
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:33,390
What do you want? Let Jan get you some.

241
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,270
What?

242
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,790
That's why do we have siblings, little brother.

243
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,990
-You still tease your little bro, huh? 
-Nuea.

244
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,710
-Just get him some food. It's fine. 
 -You are a good brother, aren't you?

245
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:44,910
That's fine.. I'm not hungry.

246
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:46,830
How long have you been here?

247
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:49,030
Not long for me.

248
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:51,910
But those two already came in the morning to help mom.

249
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:52,580
Good boys.

250
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,510
Good.

251
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:56,710
Why didn't you come to help mom?

252
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:03,230
Well, I got up at 5 to dress up.

253
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:09,510
Hey, Tai. Tien told us about that.

254
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,550
About what?

255
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:16,390
Did you really break up with Patts?

256
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:21,710
Really? I didn't get a chance to see him.

257
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,870
What did you fight over?

258
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:28,990
Was it so bad that let you guys break up?

259
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:35,550
I didn't tell the details. You should tell them yourself.

260
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,830
Um.

261
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:40,870
Well, nothing special. That's it.

262
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:43,630
You got a soul mate as your boyfriend. This is precious.

263
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:44,750
Right?

264
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,070
Yeah.

265
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:52,950
As it comes down to this, do you still want me to believe in soul mate?

266
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,310
Right.

267
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:01,670
Dad's here.

268
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,230
There he comes.

269
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:11,030
An example of breaking up with his soul mate nicely.

270
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,910
How are you?

271
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:13,710
I'm very well.

272
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:15,310
Thank you for coming.

273
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:17,150
-Are you good?
 -Yes.

274
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:18,190
You both look gorgeous.

275
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,790
(Together) Thank you.

276
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,310
You look good, too.
 That's so nice.

277
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:24,590
Wow, what a compliment!

278
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,860
Got a lot of guests?

279
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,510
Yes. All known people.

280
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:36,590
Let me ask you something. As you guys see this...

281
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,820
don't you feel something?

282
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:46,310
Dad is congratulating mom about her new wedding.

283
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:49,510
I can cook here, as a showcase.

284
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,430
Dad.

285
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:06,670
Hello!

286
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:07,870
Dad!

287
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:11,070
-How are you, my son? -You're so handsome today.

288
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:14,070
Of course. Today is your mother's big day.

289
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,790
How are you guys?

290
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,110
We're good.

291
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:18,790
And you?

292
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:21,510
I'm absolutely great and happy.

293
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,790
Seeing you all here,

294
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,430
I am very happy.

295
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:26,270
Do we have some food?

296
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:28,350
Are you hungry? Chan can get you some food.

297
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,270
Is that nice?

298
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:29,830
Yes.

299
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:30,590
No!

300
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:31,710
Yes.

301
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:34,470
Yes, it's nice. Please get some food for me, Jan.

302
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:37,630
You are complaining, just like before.

303
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,030
Just like before.

304
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:57,630
When love arrives at the destination,

305
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,870
it's a new beginning.

306
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,630
In this wedding ceremony,

307
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:04,630
You will witness their love.

308
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:07,230
Well, without further ado,

309
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:11,270
Please give a round of applause to the bride and groom.

310
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:16,470
Thank you all.

311
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:19,630
We don't have a video presentation today.

312
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:22,790
So, let's hear from this couple about their love story.

313
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,510
Would you like to start, Nu?

314
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:30,070
Our story is not complicated.

315
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:35,550
We are the middle-age lovers. We started simply.

316
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:40,070
We worked together at first.

317
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:46,870
Then we learned about each other's minds and work ethics.

318
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:51,270
And we started talking about more than just our work.

319
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:53,950
We talked about our personal stuff.

320
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:59,860
After that, we went somewhere together. We got our common hobbies.

321
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:03,710
Our relationship began to develop fast.

322
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:08,550
Finally, we became lovers.

323
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:18,670
Then, we discussed that we wanted to make the rest of our lives count.

324
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:21,190
Make our lives happier.

325
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:24,430
So, we decided to get married.

326
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:28,220
We want to live together forever.

327
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:37,190
Moreover, since today is my most important day,

328
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:41,070
I want to give my gratitude to a lady

329
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:44,030
who is very important to my life.

330
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,500
She's Yadfah.

331
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:50,870
She walked into my life.

332
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:55,270
She made me feel the happiness in love.

333
00:30:55,950 --> 00:31:02,110
She made me feel important and I want to live on.

334
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:12,790
Today, I swear to Yad,

335
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,950
in front of all of our guests,

336
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:21,670
that I will do my best to take care of Yad,

337
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:26,270
and love Yad forever.

338
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:36,830
As you all know,

339
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:43,830
I had my first marriage and my first family.

340
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:47,150
I have my children.

341
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:59,510
Today, my kids and ex-husband all come here to congratulate me and Nu.

342
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:10,190
Though today's a new beginning for me,

343
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:23,830
they are still my beloved ones. I love them, forever.

344
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:33,350
Thank you all. Next...

345
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:37,830
Jan, I feel a bit dizzy. Can I get a rest in your room?

346
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,630
Sure. The door's unlocked.

347
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:06,030
Yad...

348
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:13,550
I think that you and Warun should talk to Saengtai.

349
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:14,390
But...

350
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:15,550
Don't you worry.

351
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:18,270
I got it here.

352
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:25,590
The most important thing now is to talk with Saengtai.

353
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:28,030
Let him understand us.

354
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,750
We can't leave him like that.

355
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:35,150
It will keep to trouble him.

356
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:40,790
If Saengtai's happy, we'll be happy.

357
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:47,110
And now, Saengtai is my son, too.

358
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:11,030
[Why does everybody have to act as if nothing had happened?]

359
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:14,699
[I know you still love mom.]

360
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:16,949
[Stop lying to yourself.]

361
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:25,830
Tai, can I come in?

362
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,429
Yes.

363
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:39,630
How are you feeling? Getting better?

364
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:43,870
You know that I lied. I don't have a headache.

365
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:55,630
Okay. Then, do you want to say something to us?

366
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:58,550
No.

367
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:12,950
Tai.

368
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:17,750
We are sorry.

369
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:28,860
I discussed with mom. We agreed not to bring our own problems to you.

370
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:40,230
That was a careless thought. We thought that it would be better for you to know nothing.

371
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:49,430
We wanted you to grow up happily, without the problems between us.

372
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:56,990
Especially you, who has hearing-loss like us.

373
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:09,030
Tai, do you remember? I had told you that I loved your mom so much.

374
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:14,150
I have never lied to myself, and to you.

375
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,550
Never.

376
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:20,710
And, I believe that... with all my heart that...

377
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:26,390
mom still loves me too, right?

378
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:34,550
Then, why did you still get a divorce?

379
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:44,710
Tai, marriage is not only about love.

380
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:49,230
There are so many things in it.

381
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:06,670
Hey, dear, you don't forget that we'll have a family trip tomorrow?

382
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:14,230
Hey, I'm so sorry. I'll have important work tomorrow with my clients tomorrow.

383
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:16,070
I can't go.

384
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:21,230
Once again, right?

385
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:25,550
But I can promise. I'll take care of everything in April.

386
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:29,870
And then, we can have a trip together.

387
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:34,030
You promised like that last time.

388
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:36,550
Then I told the kids that you can come

389
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:41,790
and they were so excited about traveling together.

390
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:44,510
But this job is very important to me.

391
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:46,510
I can't leave it.

392
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:47,630
Well,

393
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:50,230
You go ahead with them this time.

394
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:51,190
Listen.

395
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:58,910
Have you ever asked yourself when was the last time you spend time with your family?

396
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:05,830
Aren't you making trouble now?

397
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:07,390
I'm not.

398
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:09,670
I just asked you a question.

399
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:13,470
You're workaholic.

400
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:16,070
You put your family aside.

401
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:19,070
You forget all of us.

402
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,870
Don't you say that!

403
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:26,670
All I do is for our family. Don't you know that?

404
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:32,110
If you do it for your family, you should stay with them.

405
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:35,390
What do you want?

406
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:37,910
I don't want anything.

407
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:41,990
I just want everyone to be happy.

408
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:46,270
So the happiness doesn't need money?

409
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:50,070
Does what we have now is not sufficient?

410
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,270
No!

411
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:54,830
Can you start being more considerate?

412
00:38:54,830 --> 00:39:01,150
All what I have done is to build a good foundation for our kids' lives.

413
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:03,310
They are growing up.

414
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:04,590
They need to study.

415
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:06,550
They need money.

416
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:09,550
They need a better life. Have you ever thought about that?

417
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:12,550
Or traveling is the only thing you have thought about?

418
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:17,110
Then, when will our family going to be really happy?

419
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,830
Hm? When?

420
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:24,190
I don't know.

421
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:30,030
Stop pressuring me with that kind of question!

422
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:32,470
Now, I am pressuring you?

423
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:35,950
Yes, you do. I'm exhausted.

424
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:38,630
I'm tired of managing my time

425
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:41,830
to spend on something unnecessary!

426
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:47,350
Unnecessary? That's selfish.

427
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:51,270
Selfish? You are the one who want to get everything from me!

428
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:55,830
I don't see our kids asking for the things that you're asking for.

429
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,830
I don't think so.

430
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:01,710
You are never available. You never care anything.

431
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:05,670
You just have dinner with kids, and that's it.

432
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:09,590
You never ask how they are and how they feel.

433
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:13,870
You only ask what they want to study.

434
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,430
Just that.

435
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:22,110
Warun.

436
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:27,110
Maybe we should separate.

437
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:34,230
I know what you want.

438
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:38,350
Today, we fight. Then we make up.

439
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:43,990
But tomorrow, we will repeat this about the same thing.

440
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:53,430
And, I know that I can't give you what you want now.

441
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:02,630
Got that.

442
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:16,630
Tai, listen.

443
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:23,470
We weren't really separated that time.

444
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:27,310
For one year since that day,

445
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:36,630
we tried to talk, to adjust and move forward.

446
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:42,470
But eventually, it did not work.

447
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:44,990
It did not work.

448
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:52,030
Today, we're on different paths.

449
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:55,350
But, we still share the same goal.

450
00:41:56,590 --> 00:42:00,830
It's to make you guys happy.

451
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:10,270
We also had a discussion about that.

452
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:17,190
If we stayed, it can't be good.

453
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:23,270
We came back to each other and talked a lot.

454
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:31,190
Then, I told your mom that we should get a divorce.

455
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:01,590
I'm sorry, dear.

456
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:06,310
I hurt you, but I didn't realize that.

457
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:14,390
But I want you to know that

458
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:19,590
although we're separated,

459
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:27,070
we still love you, and concern you all.

460
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:34,910
Our love just changed to a different form.

461
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:44,550
Although we are separated, we are still soul mates.

462
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:49,470
We are soul mates forever.

463
00:43:53,390 --> 00:44:01,670
Do you know that? When it rains,

464
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:06,710
we talk to each other.

465
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:10,030
We ask about how's each other doing.

466
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:14,100
We talk about all of you.

467
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:33,910
Do you think that we've made the right decision?

468
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:44,790
I do believe that it's better than before.

469
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:51,350
How are the kids?

470
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:55,990
I'm concerned about Saengtai the most.

471
00:44:56,870 --> 00:45:01,270
He cried and never got out of his room. He didn't go to anywhere.

472
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:06,030
Do you think I should talk to him?

473
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:11,430
Maybe not now.

474
00:45:11,830 --> 00:45:14,350
He can't understand now.

475
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:17,540
It would be better to continue what we discussed before.

476
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:21,030
Try our best to raise our children.

477
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:24,270
Cheer up, Yad.

478
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:27,470
You, too.

479
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:42,630
Tai and Tien are with you?

480
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:44,070
Yeah.

481
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:46,110
They are all grown up, right?

482
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:48,550
But why are they still act like kids.

483
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:54,430
Tai has not come home for so long. How is he?

484
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:57,510
He seems happy.

485
00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:00,990
Don't worry about him.

486
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:07,510
I also want to get an apartment for Saengtien, so he'll be close to college.

487
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:11,270
And also to be close to Tai.

488
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:13,950
So, they can often see each other.

489
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:16,350
And, we can take care of them.

490
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:18,830
Good. That would be nice.

491
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:21,270
Take care of yourself.

492
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:23,270
You, too.

493
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:45,270
I want to tell you that love is the business of two people,

494
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:49,590
but not destiny.

495
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:59,790
We used to be a couple,

496
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:07,990
that's the most amazing thing in my life.

497
00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:16,150
It's also magical, and great,

498
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:24,390
for having all of you.

499
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:37,390
Kids. Listen up.

500
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:40,550
From how mom and I spent our life together,

501
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:48,950
I know that this is the perfect time for us all about mom's marriage.

502
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:54,270
I'm so glad for your mom that

503
00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:59,150
Nu can come into her life.

504
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:04,150
Mom's got another man to take care of her.

505
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:11,630
And, if time can go back, I would still want this.

506
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:13,910
I can't change myself.

507
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:19,790
I want mom to be happy.

508
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:26,750
This is my love for mom.

509
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:35,030
Being soul mates is not more important than doing what we believe in,

510
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:37,870
or what do we think about.

511
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:49,830
Dad. Mom. I'm sorry.

512
00:48:56,990 --> 00:49:01,070
We have never been angry with you.

513
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:07,950
Actually, we should talk with you all.

514
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:10,950
It would have been better.

515
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:18,940
Shall we all get a new beginning?

516
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:28,510
Can I ask for something?

517
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:30,500
Absolutely.

518
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:40,350
No matter what will happen, please don't leave each other alone.

519
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:42,990
No, we won't.

520
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:46,390
We love you guys.

521
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:49,150
And we love each other.

522
00:49:58,310 --> 00:50:00,910
Uncle Nu, do you want to join?

523
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:31,230
Tai. I know that you break up with Patts.

524
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:43,990
But I want to tell you one thing.

525
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:48,230
When you find the good love,

526
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:52,310
you know how to take care of it, right?

527
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:53,790
Hm?

528
00:50:58,470 --> 00:51:00,910
I want you to know

529
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:05,390
that you are the person I love the most.

530
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:12,710
I'm glad that you're here with me now.

531
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:17,390
I think that is enough.

532
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:37,030
Thank you, Dad.

533
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:40,190
Come here.

534
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:56,390
This is the final draft. I want to ask you for advice.

535
00:51:56,390 --> 00:51:57,350
What story do you want to tell?

536
00:51:57,350 --> 00:51:58,750
The message from my heart.

537
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:00,830
Patts resigned two weeks ago.

538
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:02,510
Where are you going?

539
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:03,860
I'm going to find Patts.

540
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:05,990
But we don't know where the clinic is.

541
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:08,990
But no matter what, I will find him.
