1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:24,910
At the last day of the camp, shall we go to Doi Mae Pliang together?

3
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,430
Who's that girl?

4
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:29,070
She is cute.

5
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,070
I made it for my ex boyfriend.

6
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,540
He's also a vet and he's in this camp.

7
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:42,150
Once I heard that, I came here to make up with him.

8
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,550
Food is here.

9
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,590
Please come and eat.

10
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,150
Come here, you guys.

11
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,270
Take your food.

12
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,590
Come here.

13
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,030
Hey, Bow!

14
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,070
Yes?

15
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,590
Food is here.

16
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,750
Come here and get your food.

17
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,390
Come and eat, guys.

18
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,590
Today's so hot.

19
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,590
Right?

20
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:48,790
This is the bento with omelet?

21
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,470
Yes.

22
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,470
Wow!

23
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,550
Tien!

24
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,950
Hey, my brother!

25
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,230
Stop.

26
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,510
It's not yours.

27
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:11,110
I'm your little brother.

28
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,630
I already knew that.

29
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,710
Have you seen Patts?

30
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,990
He's not done yet, I guess.

31
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:21,390
I heard he went to the village for some cases.

32
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,230
OK.

33
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,710
OK. OK. OK.

34
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,030
Your food is there.

35
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,910
The brown box.

36
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:34,110
It's not a special one. Because I don't care.

37
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,110
Patts.

38
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:31,590
Fluke and Ruj told me you're here.

39
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,190
So I come here and get you.

40
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,670
I made you the bento.

41
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,670
It's all your favorite food.

42
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,150
There are flower-shaped carrots.

43
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:53,350
It's weird that I still remember every detail about him,

44
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,310
about what he likes or dislikes.

45
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,190
The omelet must not be cooked with so much oil.

46
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,630
He also likes flower-shaped carrots like this.

47
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,710
Isn't it cute?

48
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:24,230
Is there something you want to talk about?

49
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:31,190
Last time, I said I want us to get back.

50
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,180
I'm serious.

51
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,510
Can you give me a chance?

52
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,659
I'm sorry, Nara.

53
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:56,470
I'm sorry that I didn't say anything last time.

54
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,750
But, I think...

55
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:08,260
we really can't do that.

56
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:28,670
If you don't have any feelings on me,

57
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,470
why you kissed me two months ago?

58
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:54,110
Why do you still give me hope?

59
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:34,350
Your feelings for me are really gone?

60
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,030
I'm sorry.

61
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,430
I was really drunk that day.

62
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:57,470
I couldn't control myself.

63
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:04,630
I'm sorry, for everything that come to this.

64
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,430
Never mind.

65
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,750
I'm wrong, too.

66
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:29,710
I'm too full of myself.

67
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,270
Sorry.

68
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,950
Can I ask you something?

69
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:48,350
You are seeing someone else, right?

70
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,430
Yes.

71
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:59,310
I found my soul mate.

72
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,830
OK.

73
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,350
So that's it.

74
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,390
I understand.

75
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,660
I got to go.

76
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,230
Thank you.

77
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:02,750
Do you believe in the soul-mate-stuff?

78
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,230
Tai.

79
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:13,230
Can I ask you something?

80
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:18,790
Does the relationship between your parents

81
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:21,790
make you don't believe in soul mates?

82
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:27,750
I think the most important thing is yourself, Tai.

83
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,470
I do think so.

84
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:34,670
Both of us may understand more about soul mates

85
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:38,830
if we can go to Doi Mae Pliang together.

86
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,710
Doi Mae Pliang.

87
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:24,710
How about this?

88
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,990
You can be more dramatic.

89
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,830
(Screaming)

90
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:29,910
Why are you screaming?

91
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,630
Because of you.

92
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,830
Anybody see Saengtai?

93
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:39,190
What?

94
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,710
Have you seen Saengtai?

95
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,950
No.

96
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,190
Wait. Hold on,

97
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,270
Dr. Patts.

98
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:51,990
Didn't Saengtai get to you?

99
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:53,830
No, he didn't.

100
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,790
I called him,

101
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:58,070
but it seemed the connection's bad.

102
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,310
What...

103
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,550
Patts, what's going on?

104
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,590
About what?

105
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:15,670
Saengtai walked towards you...

106
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,710
and Nara.

107
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,630
Saengtai.

108
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,220
Um, did you have your meal?

109
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,230
Not yet.

110
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:26,230
Do you want to join us?

111
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,910
Let's go to the rendezvous.

112
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,790
Let's go.

113
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:32,230
I tried to stop him.

114
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:38,270
I thought you, Saengtai, and Nara can make things clear.

115
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,950
Is there something wrong, Patts?

116
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:58,030
Tien, Tai's gone.

117
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,630
What?

118
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,660
He's gone?

119
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:09,150
Fin, you are such an idiot.

120
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,750
Dream, what's going on?

121
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:33,150
Saengtai disappeared.

122
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:36,270
We're going to look for him.

123
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,750
Saengtai?

124
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:49,710
Seangtai is Patts's soul mate.

125
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:01,190
Patts.

126
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:06,030
You must find Saengtai.

127
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,430
Can you two come with me over there?

128
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:17,270
Yes.

129
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,310
Dr. Patts.

130
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,710
Did you see him?

131
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,750
Didn't see him?

132
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,109
No, we didn't.

133
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:08,710
I nearly asked all of the villagers.

134
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:11,510
Maybe he just want to rest in the room?

135
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,630
Anybody checked the room?

136
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:14,670
Kung.

137
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:16,190
I'll go and check our room.

138
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,710
-Yes. 
-Can I borrow your car?

139
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:19,990
Sure. But it's the car carrying food. Is that OK?

140
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:22,589
-Of course. 
-Patts. I'll go with you.

141
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:23,470
Me too.

142
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,270
Go to get the car.

143
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,470
This way.

144
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:29,230
-What should we do? 
-Are we going to find him?

145
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,750
What can we do?

146
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,990
Thank you.

147
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,430
You two check the back of the camp.

148
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,260
I'll check the room.

149
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,030
Can you look down over there?

150
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:50,030
-If you find him, let me know immediately. 
-Tai!

151
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:51,870
Tai!

152
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:55,820
Tai!

153
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,750
Tai! Are you there?

154
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:17,950
[I'll be free at the last day of the camp. Let's go to Doi Mae Plaing together.]

155
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,820
Doi Mae Pliang.

156
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,750
Tien! Doi Mae Pliang.

157
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:37,550
Tai went to Doi Mae Pliang.

158
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,750
Doi Mae Pliang...

159
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,950
Doi Mae Pliang. Soul mate.

160
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,870
Shit! Why didn't I think of that?

161
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:48,630
What about Doi Mae Pliang?

162
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,510
Tien! Wait!

163
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,270
Tien!

164
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:56,830
Stop!

165
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,750
I don't want to blame you.

166
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,990
That's Dr. Patts.

167
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,390
Pick it up.

168
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,670
Yes, Dr. Patts?

169
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,630
What? Doi Mae Pliang?

170
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,030
Doi Mae Pliang...

171
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:18,950
Yes.

172
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,230
OK.

173
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,990
Dr. Patts said Tai went to Doi Mae Pliang.

174
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:27,070
But it's very dangerous going there alone.

175
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,100
The flood will be released recently.

176
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,870
It rains a lot in this season.

177
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:34,350
No one is allowed to get into the mountain.

178
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:37,270
When will the rain stop?

179
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:40,270
I have no idea. Please calm down.

180
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:42,350
I'm so worried about him.

181
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:44,670
Calm down, Bow.

182
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,710
Tien, stop!

183
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,830
I'm coming to find my brother.

184
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,630
Tien!

185
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:52,870
Screw you!

186
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,030
You'd better calm down now.

187
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,670
You know nothing!

188
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,230
Yes, I know nothing.

189
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:01,870
But everybody is worried about your brother!

190
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:04,870
Do you really want them to worry about you too?

191
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,670
Listen to me.

192
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,830
If you and I go find Tai now,

193
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:17,420
we will make everything more difficult.

194
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,310
So calm down.

195
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:24,230
There might be some solutions. We just don't get it now.

196
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,870
Let's think about it together, OK?

197
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:41,870
I know why he wants to go up on Doi Mae Pliang.

198
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:48,590
It's not only my brother who gets hearing loss,

199
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,950
so does my parents.

200
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,910
They went there once.

201
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:58,910
They proposed up there.

202
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,990
But finally they broke up.

203
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:08,430
Since then, Tai don't believe soul mates.

204
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:12,270
You know...

205
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:16,430
Ever since he found his soul mate,

206
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:18,710
he changed his mind.

207
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:24,670
If he has some problems with Patts now,

208
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:29,470
he would go there to prove something.

209
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,910
Like what my parents did.

210
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:43,190
I know this story like the back of my hand. Why didn't I realize this?

211
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:47,790
Why didn't I remember? I'm an asshole!

212
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,350
Listen.

213
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:04,190
I'm here for you.

214
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:09,870
I believe that your brother will be fine.

215
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,910
It's pouring so hard.

216
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:32,270
Let's wait until the rain is lighter.

217
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:42,830
Patts!

218
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:44,750
Tai!

219
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:48,310
Where are you?

220
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,590
Lomfon!

221
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:12,270
Lomfon!

222
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,870
Wake up!

223
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,100
Lomfon!

224
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,750
Help us! Is anybody here?

225
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:21,230
Lomfon! Can you hear me?

226
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:22,910
Help!

227
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,230
Help us, please!

228
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:28,790
Is there anybody? Help!

229
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:30,790
Lomfon!

230
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:35,270
Lomfon!

231
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:43,460
Saengtai!

232
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:44,990
Patts!

233
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:48,910
I'm hurt.

234
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:54,150
Tai, where are you?

235
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:56,310
Tai, tell me.

236
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,510
Tell me!

237
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:03,070
Doi Mae Pliang.

238
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:05,750
Water...

239
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,430
Doi Mae Pliang.

240
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:13,510
Water.

241
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:18,190
You stay there and wait for me.

242
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:21,030
I'll get you.

243
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,750
I must find you.

244
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:28,950
Tai.

245
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:30,750
Tai.

246
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:34,550
Saengtai.

247
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,270
Patts...

248
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:53,990
I was so worried about you. You know that?

249
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:58,830
How did you find me?

250
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:03,590
I can always find you.

251
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,710
We are soul mates.

252
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,270
Can you stand?

253
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,270
Ouch!

254
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,710
Are you hurt?

255
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:35,830
I think my ankle's hurt.

256
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:49,070
-What about now?
-Good.

257
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:10,830
-Patts.
 -Yes?

258
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:13,750
I want to have a rest.

259
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,230
OK.

260
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,110
Ouch.

261
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:29,110
I'm going to give you a check-up.

262
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,270
Ouch.

263
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:44,750
Is it hurt?

264
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,350
A little bit.

265
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,580
How about here?

266
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:04,790
You hurt your ankle.

267
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:08,030
Let's take a rest.

268
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:10,270
Let me take that off.

269
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:37,190
Hello, Kung.

270
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,870
I found Saengtai.

271
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:45,060
He's fine.

272
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:48,230
We're at the foothill.

273
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:53,310
Can someone drive and pick us up here?

274
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:56,230
Thank you.

275
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,550
I'm sorry.

276
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:10,870
For what?

277
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:15,990
For I made a mess.

278
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:28,630
You know what,

279
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:32,510
I'm not angry with you or Nara.

280
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:36,230
I'm not angry about what happened today or two months ago.

281
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:41,110
But the fact that you two are inseparable...

282
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,870
is making me confused,

283
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:46,790
and I doubt our relationship.

284
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:59,220
Are we a perfect match? Or that's just imagined that out?:

285
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:06,870
I feel Nara seemed right for you.

286
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:10,870
I made it for my ex boyfriend.

287
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:13,590
Your ex boyfriend?

288
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:16,430
Yeah.

289
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:20,590
He's also a vet and he's in this camp.

290
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:25,710
Once I heard that, I came here to make up with him.

291
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,180
And, all of these...

292
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:45,860
made me want to go to the hill alone.

293
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:52,350
I do remember what you said.

294
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:56,670
You said that I can figure something out

295
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:59,070
if I reached the top.

296
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:04,950
So, I wanted to reach there as fast as possible.

297
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:08,030
I wanted to know myself.

298
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:10,390
I wanted to understand myself.

299
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:16,510
But you know what?

300
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:25,590
It fucking hurts.

301
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:29,230
I can't figure out anything.

302
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:34,180
But I can feel them so real.

303
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,990
I'm not mad at you.

304
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:55,830
I just want you to know

305
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:59,710
that you're the one I love most.

306
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:08,190
Even if the world doesn't have this soul-mate-thing,

307
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:10,190
or hearing loss,

308
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:14,510
or what we believe now,

309
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:21,230
I'll still choose to love you.

310
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:51,390
Do you still want to go to the top of  Doi Mae Pliang?

311
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:03,910
For understanding something?

312
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:07,510
That's not necessary now.

313
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,469
Why?

314
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:16,510
I think...

315
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:21,909
Reaching the top...

316
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:25,870
is not the most important thing.

317
00:34:29,949 --> 00:34:35,389
It's just a place. And that's it.

318
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:41,270
The most important thing is

319
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:47,350
that we really love each other.

320
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:50,590
And that love brings them to the top.

321
00:34:57,310 --> 00:35:01,830
I guess, even if I reach there,

322
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:09,150
I still can't understand my mother's remarriage.

323
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:16,830
But at least I know,

324
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:23,950
my parents got some trouble in their relationship.

325
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,950
Just like me.

326
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:37,670
But now, you are here with me.

327
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:50,070
That's the most important thing.

328
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:05,590
I'm really happy that you're here.

329
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:10,670
That's enough for me.

330
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:40,110
Let's sleep for a while now.

331
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:50,230
Here?

332
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:52,550
It's cold.

333
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:08,310
What now!

334
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:32,110
Good night.

335
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:34,990
Good night.

336
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:24,110
Good morning, Saengtai.

337
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:32,310
Good morning, Patts.

338
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,110
Did you sleep well last night?

339
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:45,830
It's weird, but it's good.

340
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,230
How come?

341
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:57,230
Well, the weather is not good,

342
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:00,590
but I feel so good.

343
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,950
Tai.

344
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:43,630
Will you be my boyfriend?

345
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:07,470
[Unfuck it.]

346
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:24,510
I'll take that as a yes.

347
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:28,870
OK.

348
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:37,790
Saengtai!

349
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:39,870
Saengtai, is that you?

350
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:42,510
Saengtai!

351
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,350
Here I am.

352
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:46,470
Patts! Saengtai!

353
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:52,950
Saengtai!

354
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:34,990
(Screaming)

355
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:37,910
Saengtai!

356
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:40,230
Saengtai!

357
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:42,710
How do you feel?

358
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:47,030
Are you hurt? Does it hurt? You're not hurt, right?

359
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:47,790
Saengtai.

360
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:48,950
Bow.

361
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:50,030
Please.

362
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:51,430
You hurt your leg!

363
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:54,420
Oops! Sorry! Sorry!

364
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:58,710
Never mind.

365
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:07,350
Umm, you guys, I'm sorry for everything.

366
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:09,340
I made such a mess.

367
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:12,070
Are you okay, Patts?

368
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:13,870
Yes.

369
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:19,270
I tell you what, Fin and I prayed all night.

370
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:21,630
Fin preyed in with his country melodies.

371
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:22,950
How about that?

372
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:27,390
(Singing) I told you, it does work.

373
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:32,870
I did my dancing pray all night. Ask Bow.

374
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:34,790
She did dance.

375
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:38,910
I saw that at two in the morning. I thought it was a ghost.

376
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:41,830
I was worried about him.

377
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:43,230
Thank you.

378
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:46,870
Are you hot?

379
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:47,790
Tai!

380
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:52,670
Tien.

381
00:44:57,350 --> 00:44:59,750
I'm so worried about you.

382
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:03,230
I'll sever our brotherhood relationship with you if you do that again.

383
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:05,190
I'm sorry.

384
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:10,070
Ouch!

385
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:14,590
I know you're worried.

386
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:17,070
I'm sorry.

387
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:22,910
Don't be a baby.

388
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:53,510
Lomfon! What's wrong? Help!

389
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:56,990
Patts. I'm hurt.

390
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:02,390
Where are you?

391
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:04,750
Tell me.

392
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:08,190
Tell me!

393
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:10,070
Doi Mae Pliang.

394
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:20,630
Lomfon.

395
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:23,990
Do you have a crush on someone?

396
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:25,030
Yes, I do.

397
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:30,350
Patts, I need to talk to you.

398
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:33,950
Saengnuea!

399
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:36,270
Hey! Come in!

400
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:39,150
If you hurt my brother's feelings, you're dead meat.
