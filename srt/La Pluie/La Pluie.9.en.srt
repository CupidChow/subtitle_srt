1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,590
Saengtai.

3
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,230
How did you find me?

4
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,070
I can always find you.

5
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,510
We are soul mates.

6
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,470
Will you be my boyfriend?

7
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,590
Lomfon!

8
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:20,310
Lomfon!

9
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,030
Lomfon!

10
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,350
What's wrong?

11
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,070
Help us!

12
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,270
Is anybody here? Help!

13
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:32,390
[Patts! I'm hurt.]

14
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,230
[Tai, do you believe in soul mates?]

15
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:40,990
[I believe hearing loss is just...]

16
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:44,900
[...an illness, technically.]

17
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:50,030
Don't you think it's strange that the universe could determine our destiny?

18
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,670
What do you mean?

19
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,790
That's just a coincidence?

20
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,790
This is just a coincidence that happened at the same time.

21
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,030
Not even a destiny.

22
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,510
No one can control your love, right?

23
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,910
[Tai, where are you?]

24
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,430
[Tai, tell me.]

25
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,350
[Doi Mae Pliang.]

26
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,790
[I just don't believe in soul mates.]

27
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,670
Lomfon.

28
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:36,670
Are you alright?

29
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,430
Easy.

30
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,470
Easy.

31
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,310
Thanks.

32
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:58,310
You really freaked me out.

33
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,990
You suddenly fainted like that.

34
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:04,350
I'm so worried about you!

35
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,310
Did I make you work too hard?

36
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,390
Or you didn't sleep well?

37
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,670
Honestly, I'm sorry.

38
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,070
I will not make you work hard anymore.

39
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:18,070
Do you faint like that a lot?

40
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,310
No. I never do that before.

41
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:27,670
Did you guys find Saengtai?

42
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:32,190
The officers are on the way to get him back.

43
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:39,430
Mr. Saengtien, Mr. Saengtai is here.

44
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,670
OK. I'll be right there.

45
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:42,510
Thank you so much.

46
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,750
No problem.

47
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:51,630
Are you OK? Let's go to see Tai and Patts.

48
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,990
Tai!

49
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,350
Tien.

50
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,790
I was so worried about you.

51
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:28,630
I'll sever our brotherhood relationship with you if you do that again.

52
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,390
Sorry.

53
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,830
Ouch!

54
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,270
Do you intend to hurt my other leg?

55
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,110
Shut up!

56
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,750
I'd like to say sorry again.

57
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,750
This will never happen.

58
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:57,470
If it does happen, I'll go to there and drag you back.

59
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,030
Don't cry.

60
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,150
Lomfon.

61
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,110
Yes?

62
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,550
Is there something wrong?

63
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,630
Nothing.

64
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:24,630
I'm just relieved to see you back safe and sound.

65
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,950
Stop joking around.

66
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,750
Coming.

67
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,670
It's you, Nara.

68
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,550
Can I have a talk to you?

69
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:55,070
So, I asked Saengtai to be my boyfriend.

70
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,350
Wow!

71
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,350
Are you guys actually a couple now?

72
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:04,030
Are you hearing this, Kung?

73
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:08,950
Finally, my dear friend has a boyfriend!

74
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:13,830
I'm so glad that you're OK.

75
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:16,420
Hey, bro, you're awesome!

76
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,550
I give you a thumbs up.

77
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,430
Me, too.

78
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,230
Fin and I can't tease you about it anymore, huh?

79
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,950
There will be something to tease about later on. Trust me.

80
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,550
Enough you guys!

81
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,590
Anyway, I'm so glad for you.

82
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:38,710
Where is my dear friend now?

83
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,150
He must have fallen asleep with the medicine.

84
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,630
He was so exhausted since yesterday.

85
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,550
OK.

86
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,590
Guys!

87
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:52,070
Isn't it a good time to party? Right, guys?

88
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,350
Great, bro!

89
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,110
I've been waiting for you to say that.

90
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,110
We're down for this!

91
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,510
There you go.

92
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,540
We should do that.

93
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:05,830
Bow, there is a place to have a bonfire. I'll arrange that!

94
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:11,510
Kung said there is a place to have a bonfire. She'll arrange that for us!

95
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,710
Cool!

96
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:15,630
Fin. Since this is the last night we are here,

97
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:18,350
why don't you sing for us?

98
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,190
Here.

99
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,350
(Singing)

100
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,910
-There, there, why did I listen to this?
-Are you OK?

101
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,510
-I'm bored.
-Not getting better?

102
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:43,390
Alright. See you at the bonfire!

103
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,030
Yay! There must be so much fun.

104
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:50,430
Saengtien, please take care of Lomfon.

105
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:53,430
Lomfon, you must join us if you can.

106
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,750
No problem.

107
00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:05,710
(Singing)

108
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,790
I'm sorry, Saengtai.

109
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,790
If I knew you guys are soul mates,

110
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:22,110
I would not do that.

111
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:27,270
Actually, Patts and I are done.

112
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:33,190
I apologize for your misunderstand.

113
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:40,540
Please don't say that.

114
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:45,350
I'm the one who have to say sorry to you and everyone.

115
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:48,350
I made the trouble.

116
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,630
But I promise that what I've done

117
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:54,150
is my own decision.

118
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:57,630
And until now, I've learned a lot.

119
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:00,870
I have also figured out a lot of things.

120
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:13,030
From my perspective, you and Patts are a perfect match.

121
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:20,030
I can feel the feelings between you guys.

122
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,710
Nara!

123
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:43,230
I'll let you rest.

124
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,150
See you.

125
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,630
OK.

126
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:17,270
Thank you for your listening.

127
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,470
Let's move on to the next song.

128
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:22,390
Hold on. You'll sing the whole night?

129
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,190
You'd better eat something.

130
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:26,590
Alright. So cheers!

131
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:30,270
(Together) cheers!

132
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:41,550
Where's Dream by the way?

133
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,470
She texted me that She's blow-drying her hair now.

134
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,510
She'll be here soon.

135
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:48,950
Tien, haven't you finished yet?

136
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,110
I'm waiting for you to sing with me.

137
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:55,630
Bro, calm down. I'm catching up.

138
00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:01,630
If I finish mine, does Tai also have to do that?

139
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,390
And also Patts!

140
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,630
Bottoms up!

141
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,630
OK.

142
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,910
Bottoms up!

143
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:09,390
Awesome!

144
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,430
Saengtai, you have to finish yours.

145
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,990
Hey. You'd better take it easy.

146
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,870
Or you will get so drunk.

147
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:17,670
So what?

148
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:19,580
You're here.

149
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,630
Tai's here.

150
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,710
What do I have to be afraid of?

151
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,990
You take it easy.

152
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:34,150
Wow, they’re having so much fun now.

153
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,510
I like it so much.

154
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:39,870
Oh right. Kung, come here please.

155
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:43,430
You can't get others drunk while you're not.

156
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:44,670
-OK.
-Where's your glass?

157
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,100
Over there, Bow.

158
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,030
Here, let's have our next song.

159
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:54,270
(Together) Wow!

160
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,430
Guys.

161
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:14,190
May Nara join us?

162
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,110
Tai?

163
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,910
I talked to her.

164
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:30,470
So join us, Nara!

165
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,550
Come here.

166
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,430
Come. Come.

167
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:39,390
It reminds me of those good old days. Right, Nara?

168
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,470
I miss those days, too.

169
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:43,190
Got a glass?

170
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:45,590
-Not yet.
-I also want more.

171
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:48,550
Here you are, my bro!

172
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,910
Tien! My leg!

173
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,750
What's wrong with you?

174
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,990
What's wrong with you standing here?

175
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,590
You bumped into me.

176
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,350
Oh, really?

177
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:02,230
I'm not even aware of that.

178
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,430
Thank you, Lomfon.

179
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,550
Let's go on, Patts.

180
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:12,990
-What are we waiting for?
-Go on.

181
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,230
Let's enjoy!

182
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:25,310
♫ Tonight, I can't sleep. ♫

183
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:28,870
♫ I have never been like this before. ♫

184
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:33,030
♫ Looking at the sky or counting stars doesn't really help. ♫

185
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:36,870
♫ Forcing to close my eyes but I can't fall asleep. ♫

186
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:40,390
♫ The only thing I do is thinking of you. ♫

187
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:43,950
♫ I can't sleep all night long. ♫

188
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,550
♫ Being like this. ♫

189
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,270
♫ And feeling like this. ♫

190
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:52,190
♫ Is it love? ♫

191
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:55,990
♫ Is it only me who can't fall asleep? ♫

192
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,550
♫ I'm thinking of us all night. ♫

193
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:02,820
♫ Will you also miss me? ♫

194
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:07,430
♫ I miss you so much and I can't fall asleep. ♫

195
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,390
You, Tien.

196
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,550
Hey, you.

197
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,510
Me?

198
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,030
Truth or dare?

199
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:33,150
A person like me got nothing to hide.

200
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,540
I pick truth!

201
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,390
What should we ask him?

202
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,910
Have you ever had your first love?

203
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,630
Nope.

204
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,630
What?

205
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:54,950
You really don't?

206
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,590
Exactly.

207
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,270
Oh, come on bro.

208
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,790
-Seriously?
-Why?

209
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,060
For real?

210
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,390
Yes.

211
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,990
OK.

212
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,390
Let's continue.

213
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:11,829
One, two, three!

214
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:18,950
Truth or dare?

215
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:20,869
Dare.

216
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,670
I will give you a hard one.

217
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,710
Then truth would be fine.

218
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,430
Who wants to ask him?

219
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:34,990
Me! I want to do that.

220
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:35,870
Who?

221
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,270
Here.

222
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,990
I want to ask.

223
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,430
Lomfon.

224
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:48,030
Are you having a crush on someone now?

225
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,190
Hold on for a sec.

226
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,590
You must tell the truth. No lying is allowed.

227
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:59,670
She means that you can't tell us lies. Tell us the truth.

228
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:02,110
You don't need to translate.
 -Alright.

229
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,190
Yes, I am.

230
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:08,660
Wow!

231
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,670
So who's the person?

232
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,030
More than one question now.

233
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:16,220
(Together) Oh.

234
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,110
Continue this then.

235
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,030
Spin it!

236
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,710
Patts

237
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,350
Truth or dare?

238
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:42,910
Dare.

239
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,270
Woah!

240
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,950
Drink two bottles of wine.

241
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,510
Is that too much?

242
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,350
Accepted.

243
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:01,030
Hey, awesome!

244
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,830
That's amazing.

245
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:04,750
Patts.

246
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,990
I don't think he can do that.

247
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:14,230
-Wow.
-Patts.

248
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:15,150
Easy.

249
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,150
Patts.

250
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,830
Patts, take it slow. Patts.

251
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:21,830
-Do you feel good?
-He's great.

252
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:28,550
OK, number one!

253
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:54,950
Patts, please talk to Nara.

254
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,910
Truth or dare?

255
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,430
Dare.

256
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:29,070
Then talk with me privately.

257
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,750
You got something to say?

258
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,950
I want to say that I'm sorry.

259
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:02,310
Sorry? For what?

260
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:07,070
For I hurt you yesterday.

261
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:15,950
I found my soul mate.

262
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:29,150
That's OK, Patts. I understand.

263
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,070
I totally understand.

264
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:41,590
You found your soul mate.

265
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:50,510
And it seems that you love him so much.

266
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:57,990
I promise, I won't interfere you guys anymore.

267
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:01,110
That's not what I mean.

268
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:10,950
Listen. It's true that I don't have the romantic feelings toward you.

269
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:13,550
But, I want to make it clear.

270
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:17,070
It's not your fault.

271
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:22,030
We just can't be together as lovers.

272
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,750
It's just that.

273
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:32,190
I want to thank you.

274
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:41,350
You accompanied with me all the way, in every happiness and sadness.

275
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,950
You've been putting up with my temper.

276
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:52,870
The love between us is not gone.

277
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:58,390
I'll keep it as my precious memory.

278
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:07,070
It exists in another transform, OK?

279
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:14,870
You are still my dear friend.

280
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:30,590
Please take good care of Saengtai.

281
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:37,510
If you hurt him, I'll be very angry.

282
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:46,060
Thank you.

283
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:51,550
For all the time we've spent together,

284
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:57,150
I've been happy.

285
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:19,390
Thank you too.

286
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:30,910
Crying like a baby as usual?

287
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:33,030
You too.

288
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,150
What's up?

289
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,110
I saw you staring at me for a long time.

290
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,590
You noticed that?

291
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,500
It's nothing, seriously.

292
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,750
You look much better than you did earlier.

293
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:55,110
You don't look like someone who just went through a breakup.

294
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:03,430
I feel relieved.

295
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:07,190
It's hard to say.

296
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:11,590
After I talked to Patts and Saengtai,

297
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:16,910
everything seems to be clear.

298
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:22,580
Even the things I didn't understand before are clear now.

299
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,350
So now, I literally understand everything.

300
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:34,030
I am always here for you, you know.

301
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:36,590
Although you’re no longer Patts’s girlfriend,

302
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:39,070
I really want to see you around.

303
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:42,870
I really enjoy our talking.

304
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:49,310
Sure. We'll keep in touch.

305
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:50,790
Then we have a deal!

306
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,030
Yes.

307
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,990
Love is really hard, huh?

308
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:26,870
Hello, Tien. I'm in your university.

309
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:28,630
Where are you?

310
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,510
Quickly.

311
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:33,070
Your university is a maze.

312
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,670
OK. Bye.

313
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:41,950
Are you going back home right now?

314
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:44,270
Or you want to go somewhere else?

315
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,750
I just realize that I need to pick Duer.

316
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,830
I left it with Saengnuea.

317
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,390
OK.

318
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:55,350
It means that I got to meet your big brother now?

319
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:57,670
Yes.

320
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,500
How are you going home, Bow?

321
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,030
Do you need a ride?

322
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:09,630
Yes... but I'd better go on my own.

323
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,750
The taxi I called is over there.

324
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,950
That car right, Bow?

325
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:13,870
Yes!

326
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:19,230
OK. I'll wait for Saengtien for a while.

327
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:19,950
Yes.

328
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:23,030
I'm here. I'm here.

329
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,870
Where's the stuff?

330
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,910
It's in the trunk. I haven't brought them here yet.

331
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:31,990
Then let's pick them up.

332
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,710
I need your help.

333
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,430
I'd love to help you. Let's go.

334
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:36,910
Go.

335
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,950
OK. I got to go home. Bye, Dr. Patts.

336
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:40,430
Good bye.

337
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:42,470
Good bye, Lomfon.

338
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:51,230
Patts, I need to talk to you.

339
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,270
OK.

340
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,550
Stop complaining. I bought it for you.

341
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:14,630
When did I complain? I did not.

342
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:16,270
Is it all good?

343
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:18,430
All good now.

344
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:24,710
Where are you two going?

345
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:27,310
We'll go to select the footage for editing.

346
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:31,070
We'd better run now.

347
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:33,190
OK, Tien.

348
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:35,830
Let's go.

349
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:38,310
I'm off, lovebird.

350
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,670
You can't get me. Ha ha!

351
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,070
I'm your little brother!

352
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:50,910
Go!

353
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,350
Lomfon, let's go.

354
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:00,910
Patts, is everything OK?

355
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,350
Sure.

356
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,110
Shall we go now?

357
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:06,990
Yes.

358
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,630
-Let me take that.
 -OK.

359
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:12,230
It will be a little bit far.

360
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,630
Are you good?

361
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,550
We're here.

362
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:00,190
Saengneua.

363
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:02,710
Come on in!

364
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,510
Why are you here early?

365
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:14,750
You didn't give me a call.

366
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:21,550
I knew you'd be up.

367
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,270
Good for you.

368
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:32,030
This is Patts. I told you about him.

369
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,950
Hello.

370
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,060
Please don't bow.

371
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,430
We are all very close to Tai.

372
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:39,590
Not quite, you're two years older than me.

373
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:42,070
Oh, alright.

374
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:45,950
You looks so different from Tai and Tien.

375
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:52,030
Each of us has a different personality.

376
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:57,470
I'm Patts. Nice to meet you.

377
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:00,470
Maybe we can shake hands instead of bowing?

378
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,550
Nice to meet you, too.

379
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:10,510
Where's Duer, Nuea?

380
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:12,190
It's in the house.

381
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:14,140
It doesn't allow me to touch it.

382
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,820
You'd better go and get it.

383
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,150
How do you live with Duer?

384
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:19,550
Well you know, I'm a kind person.

385
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,430
It gets everything from me,

386
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:23,350
but I get nothing from it.

387
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:25,030
You see? I'm warm-hearted.

388
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,390
There you go.

389
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,750
I got to get Duer.

390
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:31,030
OK.

391
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:37,110
Duer!

392
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:40,630
Meow. Meow.

393
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,430
Hey! You're here.

394
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:02,150
What's going on, my boy?

395
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:05,150
You're a grown-up. You're still act spoiled with your grandmother.

396
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:09,949
If I don't do this to you, whom should I do to, grandma?

397
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:12,150
I knew you would say that.

398
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:16,150
Here, let me help you.

399
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,989
Still the same.

400
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,790
Patts.

401
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,150
Yes.

402
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,590
Let's go.

403
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:46,270
Sure.

404
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:48,949
We got to go.

405
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:49,909
OK.

406
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:53,550
Don't forget to get some sleep.

407
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:56,830
Do I look like I don't get enough sleep?

408
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:58,870
Yeah.

409
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,550
OK. Got it. Don't you have to repeat.

410
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:03,350
Safe drive home.

411
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:05,230
See you, Saengnuea.

412
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,710
Patts.

413
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:13,430
Let me tell you something.

414
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:17,630
If you hurt my brother, you're dead meat.

415
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:31,270
Saengnuea is a lot more like a grown-up than I thought.

416
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:36,990
Well after all, he's my big brother.

417
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:46,660
By the way, are you OK?

418
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:50,270
I found you're acting a little weird.

419
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:56,070
Did you used to live here?

420
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:00,270
Yeah, since I was born.

421
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:03,630
But when my parents got divorced, I moved out.

422
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:09,710
What about that?

423
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:15,750
That house was owned by the person I loved most in my life.

424
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:24,790
The house next to your house was my grandma's.

425
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,670
Don't worry, grandma.

426
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:31,590
It's just an eye inflammation.

427
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,470
Nothing to worry about that.

428
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:37,190
Use this eye dropper three to four drops a day.

429
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:38,910
It'll be fine.

430
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:41,070
Thank you.

431
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:45,550
You should go now, or the traffic will be bad.

432
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:48,150
You'll be tired before you reach home.

433
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,070
No.

434
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:54,670
I'll stay with you.

435
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:55,830
Can I?

436
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:57,950
What are you talking about?

437
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,470
Playing with me again? Big boy?

438
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:05,710
I got only you to play with.

439
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:07,190
Yeah?

440
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:11,990
Don't you stay with Nara today?

441
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:18,430
Nara stays at her house today.

442
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:20,830
I know that!

443
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:26,510
Grandma, I have something to tell you.

444
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:31,500
I heard my soul mate yesterday.

445
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:33,390
Really?

446
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,350
Yes.

447
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:36,270
What did you two talk about?

448
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,030
Does your soul mate a nice person?

449
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:42,350
He didn't reply.

450
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:45,070
Anyway,

451
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:48,590
I'll tell you all about that at dinner.

452
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:50,350
I'm starving.

453
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:51,390
I'll get something to eat.

454
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:53,190
You promise you'll tell me everything.

455
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,750
Everything, grandson!

456
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:56,790
Oops, off to kitchen first!

457
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:58,670
Please cook Massaman Curried chicken for me.

458
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:00,030
Hurry up, please.

459
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:26,350
Come on in.

460
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:36,670
I get you a new blanket.

461
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:38,990
I'll wash the old one.

462
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:40,870
Thank you.

463
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,750
What a poor boy.

464
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:49,070
What happened?

465
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:53,350
The boy's parents divorced yesterday.

466
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:57,790
He has to face all of these. It must be hard.

467
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:05,030
I'm going to bed.

468
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,670
OK. Come here.

469
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,630
Good night, grandma.

470
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:11,670
Good night.

471
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:12,550
Yes.

472
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:52,260
Grandma, do we have some desserts left?

473
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,670
Here it is.

474
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,910
Does that Desserts enough for you, my boy?

475
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:07,270
Do you want some porridge?

476
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:13,790
It's OK, grandma. Can you help me give the dessert to the boy next door?

477
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:16,270
He cried all night.

478
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:20,030
Some desserts and this supporting note might help him.

479
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:25,190
Wouldn't this make the boy confused?

480
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:30,990
Please just tell him that your grandson wants him to have these.

481
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:33,950
I already explain in the note.

482
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:35,950
I need to go, grandma.

483
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:38,950
See you next time.

484
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:44,390
I got to be in a meeting about opening a new clinic with my upperclassmen today.

485
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:47,300
Don't forget to give Ki the eye drops.

486
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,590
I'm off! Bye bye.

487
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,030
See you later, grandma.

488
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:51,630
Safe drive.

489
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:52,670
OK.

490
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:03,900
Hey, kid. Come here.

491
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,270
Yes?

492
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:11,710
My grandson wants to give you this.

493
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:13,590
Grandson?

494
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:15,310
Oh, OK.

495
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:20,550
Look inside the bag.

496
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:35,270
[I saw you were crying all night.]

497
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:38,070
[So I want to support you.]

498
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:40,350
[All of the difficulties will pass some day.]

499
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:42,830
[Hope you can get your smile back soon.]

500
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:46,540
[Happiness is a source of smile.]

501
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:52,030
[But a smile, can also be a source of happiness.]

502
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:13,070
Execuse me.

503
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:15,070
Yes, boy?

504
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:18,950
Here.

505
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:20,950
OK.

506
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:38,070
[Thank you. You are a nice person.]

507
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:40,830
[I'll try to get over this and smile again.]

508
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:55,990
Hey, boy!

509
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:59,430
Yes?

510
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:07,070
Another note.

511
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:14,990
[We might encounter many challenges in our lives.]

512
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:18,550
[This one, is one of the tests you need to go through.]

513
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:21,030
[Don't forget to smile.]

514
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:24,470
[P.S. from the Kind One.]

515
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:45,230
Dad!

516
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:49,070
Dad! Wait!

517
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:50,430
Dad!

518
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:53,470
Dad!

519
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:42,470
[You cried again?]

520
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:47,030
[Don't you forget how important your smile is?]

521
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:48,470
[Be strong.]

522
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:51,870
[P.S. from the Kind One.]

523
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:03,030
What took you so long?

524
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:04,950
What happened?

525
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:07,630
That granny passed away.

526
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:10,230
Her family come to take her stuff.

527
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:12,430
It seems that they sold the house to others.

528
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:14,430
For real?

529
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:17,980
Why would I lie about something like this?

530
00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:27,630
Hey, where are you going?

531
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:25,190
[I just heard about your grandmother. I am so sorry. I'll be right here with you.]

532
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:55,630
You're the Kind One.

533
00:48:12,110 --> 00:48:15,270
Stay away from my boyfriend. I've told you about that.

534
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:18,590
Are you telling me my brother has two soul mates?

535
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:19,750
Screw you!

536
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:22,510
I only want to know my real thought.

537
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:25,500
I want to know who I like.
