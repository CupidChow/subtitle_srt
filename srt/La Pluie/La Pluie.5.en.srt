1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:22,510
I want us to be together again.

3
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,750
You have talked to me for two years,

4
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,430
though I haven't replied even once.

5
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,020
From now on, no matter what will happen,

6
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:36,550
I won't let you go.

7
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,110
Give me your hand.

8
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:40,590
Why doesn't it beat?

9
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,710
Open the door, Tai!

10
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,590
Tai, open the door!

11
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,270
What?

12
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,630
Tien, how did you get in here?

13
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,870
This is your house. I am your brother. I duplicated the key.

14
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,470
Huh?

15
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,950
I have something to ask you.

16
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,630
And, I'm going to sleep over here.

17
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,030
Get me the bedding.

18
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,150
(Meow)

19
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,990
Shit!

20
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,550
What?

21
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,150
A cat?

22
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,110
Duer. It's ok.

23
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,630
Come here.

24
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,230
Yeah, it's my cat.

25
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,790
I adopted it.

26
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,470
Seriously?

27
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,070
Yes.

28
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,470
Look at its face.

29
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,990
Isn't it a burden?

30
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,790
It's my cat. I can take care of it.

31
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,670
What are you here for? Just say it.

32
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,230
Well, let me see.

33
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:44,150
Well, now I just can't understand myself.

34
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,910
I held one's hand.

35
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,829
And, the world seemed stopped.

36
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:50,790
Do you know what I mean?

37
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,870
Yes.

38
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,100
My heart beat so fast. I can't understand that.

39
00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:01,070
Then, I couldn't think of anything else except that.

40
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,430
You're in love!

41
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,030
What?

42
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,700
So, you happened to hold one's hand, right?

43
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,700
It made your heart beat so fast that you didn't know what to do.

44
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:19,390
Until now, you haven't been able to get it off your mind.

45
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,190
Am I right?

46
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,670
Just as perfect as my bro should be.

47
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,950
It's not just that.

48
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:31,430
You may unknowingly fall in love with that person.

49
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:34,430
Then, when you were holding hands,

50
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:38,030
your subconsciousness...

51
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:41,030
cannot control your feelings.

52
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,430
What the hell are you saying?

53
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,750
You even haven't been in love.

54
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,430
Well! Though I have not,

55
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:23,670
I have written some articles about that.

56
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,430
I am good at writing these things.

57
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,750
Brother...

58
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,870
Tell me!

59
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:44,990
If you don't tell me, I swear I'll curse you

60
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:49,710
that you will be sleepless tonight.

61
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,550
Got it, bro?

62
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,500
Are you here to make trouble with me?

63
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,870
It's all because of you.

64
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,350
Come on! Just tell me!

65
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:12,870
I met my soul mate.

66
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,270
God!

67
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,350
We both know we are each other's soul mates.

68
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,510
So, you know I am...

69
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,550
You are my soul mate.

70
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:29,350
You have talked to me for two years,

71
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:34,230
though I haven't replied even once.

72
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,870
That's awesome!

73
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,150
Tai!

74
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:46,510
Listen to me. I'm so proud of you.

75
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:49,500
Finally, you talked to him.

76
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,350
I know. You hurt me.

77
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,110
Anyway, thanks.

78
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,750
How far do you guys go?

79
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,070
Like this...

80
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,950
Or... this.

81
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,670
Or...

82
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,590
Stop that!

83
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,590
I just had a dinner with him.

84
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:15,590
And he drove me home.

85
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,390
Oh!

86
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:22,270
This is a great little step to my mind.

87
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:26,590
Finally, you stopped letting your parents' affairs dominate your life.

88
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:28,950
Who are you talking to?

89
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,630
I'm talking to my delight.

90
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,950
Okay. I'll give you two some privacy.

91
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:37,620
I'm off to bed.

92
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,630
Wow!

93
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,870
You sleep so early.

94
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:44,630
You'll know when you start working.

95
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,750
Don't you go to school tomorrow?

96
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,670
The class is in the afternoon, so...

97
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:51,060
Back to you, are you changing the topic now?

98
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,790
Good night!

99
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,220
I'm so sleepy.

100
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:55,790
Hey!

101
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,590
Have a sweet dream, bro.

102
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,510
(Mumbling) Awesome!

103
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,350
You're in love!

104
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,790
(Mumbling) Holy shit.

105
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:36,230
Tien, don't forget to

106
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:39,030
lock the door and windows.

107
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:43,190
Most importantly, don't ever let Duer out.

108
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,510
Patts?

109
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,310
Hi.

110
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,750
Are you here for me?

111
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,870
Yes.

112
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:21,030
Can I drive you to work?

113
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,390
Yes?

114
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:26,830
Your workplace and mine are close.

115
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:30,750
So, I thought we could go together.

116
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:35,470
Patts, what if I leave first today or don't have to go to work,

117
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,830
what would you do?

118
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:41,990
Well, I don't know.

119
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,750
I don't have your number.

120
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,070
And, it doesn't rain today.

121
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:50,590
I don't know how to contact you.

122
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,590
Shall we get in the car?

123
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:54,990
We're going to be late.

124
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,910
Okay.

125
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:01,950
There you go.

126
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:02,790
Thank you.

127
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,870
Careful.

128
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,150
Patts.

129
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,030
Yes?

130
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,070
Give me your phone.

131
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,790
Here.

132
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,550
Can I give you my number?

133
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,350
Sure.

134
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,190
Done.

135
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:50,390
Can you put it over there?

136
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:51,950
Ok.

137
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,310
Patts.

138
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:00,870
Yeah?

139
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:04,790
From now on, if you want to do something with me,

140
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,870
you can ask me first.

141
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,030
Why?

142
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:12,830
You don't like surprises?

143
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,630
Not that.

144
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:20,550
I don't want to enforce you

145
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,630
to do anything for me.

146
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,540
I want you to be yourself.

147
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,550
You don't have to change anything about yourself.

148
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,630
Because I'll do the same.

149
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,270
Shall we get to know each other little by little?

150
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,190
Sure. I agree.

151
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,950
Okay.

152
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,980
And, from now on...

153
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:48,470
I'll make it all up to you for the two years you've lost.

154
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:54,910
Can I hold your hand?

155
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:58,230
That's a start for your compensate.

156
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,830
-Saengtai. -Yes?

157
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:29,030
Can I ask you to do something?

158
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:34,350
I want to call you Tai.

159
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:36,470
So, I can feel closer to you.

160
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:39,630
Of course you can.

161
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,670
You can call me whatever you want.

162
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,870
All at your own convenience.

163
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,110
Thank you so much.

164
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:51,190
And, one more thing.

165
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:55,870
Why hadn't you talked to me before?

166
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,550
You don't have to tell me, if you don't want to do so.

167
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,590
No, it's okay.

168
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,070
To tell you the truth,

169
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,740
my mom and dad are soul mates.

170
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,710
But, they divorced.

171
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,910
[Although I was confident that]

172
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:28,270
[mom and dad were the luckiest couple in the world.]

173
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:34,070
What I'm about to tell you is going to be hard for you.

174
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:38,670
Your Mom and I decided to get a divorce.

175
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:40,830
[At the day they left each other,]

176
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:45,950
[they acted as if nothing had mattered.]

177
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,590
Now that it comes down to this,

178
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,630
you're really not going to say something?

179
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:58,980
Even if I say something now, you won't understand.

180
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:03,110
How can I understand as you didn't do it at all?

181
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,700
Good!

182
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:13,110
It's best... that you know nothing!

183
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,870
Mom...

184
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,870
Dad. Dad!

185
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,310
Saengchan, don't.

186
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:20,620
-Chan. -Dad!

187
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,510
-Dad! Wait! -Tai!

188
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:29,910
Why?

189
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,750
-Dad! Dad! -Tai!

190
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,750
Dad! Dad!

191
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,310
Dad! Wait!

192
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:45,550
Calm down!

193
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,030
Let me go!

194
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:48,390
Dad!

195
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,030
God!

196
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,550
Dad!

197
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,670
Dad! Wait!

198
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:02,220
[So, it changed my mind.]

199
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:06,950
[It made me believe that soul mates were not real.]

200
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,230
Dad!

201
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:15,670
You thought that being someone's soul mate can be hurt.

202
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:22,070
You really had a hard time.

203
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,830
I did have a hard time.

204
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:31,510
How did you get through it?

205
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:41,190
Well, I got this person, who is very kind,

206
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,710
helped me all the way through,

207
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,110
at every time I felt down.

208
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,500
A kind person...

209
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,910
Who's that? A he or she?

210
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,670
I'm not telling you.

211
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,870
What?

212
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,310
Just kidding.

213
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,390
I don't know who's that.

214
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,070
I don't know what the person looks like.

215
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:10,070
I knew that person from an acquaintance.

216
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,270
Please turn left over there.

217
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,510
Okay.

218
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,660
Here we are.

219
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,070
Thank you for driving me here.

220
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,350
Have a good day.

221
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,390
You, too.

222
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,150
Wow! Someone drove Saengtai to work.

223
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,630
A handsome man.

224
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:11,630
-For a reserved guy, he's got a hot one.
-I know.

225
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:14,180
Hello.

226
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,230
I got to go.

227
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,710
Okay.

228
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:38,230
Hey!

229
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:40,550
What's going on?

230
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:43,230
Got something to tell me?

231
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:50,190
If you don't tell me, I'll tell the boss you're going beyond your duty.

232
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,590
What are you talking about, Bow?

233
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,910
Don't you play dumb.

234
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:03,030
Why the hot guy that day

235
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,590
drive you here today? Huh?

236
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:07,030
-Shush! -What?

237
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,950
I have to work.

238
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:11,510
Really?

239
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,830
I'll take the stairs

240
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:13,630
to do some exercise.

241
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:14,350
Wait!

242
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,230
Don't do that!

243
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,590
How was it? What's up with him?

244
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,750
He didn't tell me.

245
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:24,510
Now, you go do your assignment that I gave you.

246
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:27,510
If I get anything, I'll update to you guys.

247
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,230
I must find it out.

248
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:32,230
Because there's always one truth!

249
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,830
Saengtai!

250
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,790
Soul mate?

251
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,590
Hold on.

252
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,590
The guy's name is Patts.

253
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,470
Your soul mate is a vet.

254
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:06,590
Wow! It all comes together now!

255
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:11,150
And you said you were going to ignore your soul mate?

256
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:15,550
I met him coincidentally .

257
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:20,430
When it rained, I did ignore him.

258
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:24,190
But when I met him,

259
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,430
and talked to him,

260
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,830
it turned out he's a really nice guy.

261
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,710
So, I'll give it a try.

262
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:36,230
Just a try?

263
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,950
He's your soul mate!

264
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:40,790
That's not just a try!

265
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,070
I support you!

266
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:45,950
Really.

267
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,950
It's so difficult to meet him.

268
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,870
May I get an iced americano?

269
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,150
Who's that?

270
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:07,790
Seangtien's friend.

271
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:12,470
Wow. He's not bad.

272
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,790
He's just a kid.

273
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:19,110
I know. A kid is not my type.

274
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,230
But he's really pretty.

275
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:33,910
Oops!

276
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,030
Oh!

277
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:13,830
Um, this is Bow, a friend from work.

278
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,950
And, this is Lomfon,

279
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,110
Saengtien's friend.

280
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,430
Lomfon,

281
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,630
nice to meet you!

282
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:27,550
And, who's that girl? It's Bow.

283
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:30,870
Hello.

284
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:36,950
So lucky I didn't touch his hand.

285
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:43,910
Are you doing a reserch for work?

286
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:45,860
Yeah.

287
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,630
I've written lots of articles these days.

288
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:51,070
My boss said the recent topic is very interesting.

289
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,950
I may got more readers for that.

290
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,510
Not surprised, I'd say.

291
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:57,310
Your articles are really fun.

292
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,470
You use an easy-to-read language.

293
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,070
I like it very much.

294
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,510
Oops!

295
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,590
Oh!

296
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:13,950
It's...

297
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,430
I need to use the restroom.

298
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,510
Didn't you just go there?

299
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:20,390
That mango and the dip sauce!

300
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:21,870
-Bow...
 -Watch my stuff!

301
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,590
I'll be right back.

302
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:24,750
Oh!

303
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,510
Woah!

304
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,070
She has diarrhea.

305
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:39,390
So, what are you writing now?

306
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,190
I'm not sure yet.

307
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:50,110
Maybe you can continue to write about food?

308
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,590
The articles you used to write.

309
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:57,230
I think it will get new readers to go back and read your past works.

310
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,990
That's a good idea.

311
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,550
When I become a writer,

312
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:07,470
I often lose a reader's perspective.

313
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,390
I know.

314
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:11,430
When I do the film works of my professor,

315
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:13,670
I lose an audience's perspective.

316
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:20,030
Then I'll back to my work?

317
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,830
Sure.

318
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:23,430
Okay.

319
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:43,030
[Is it raining there?]

320
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,710
It is, Patts.

321
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,750
[What are you doing now?]

322
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:58,510
I'm working in a coffee shop.

323
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:06,310
[I won't disturb you now then.]

324
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:08,100
[Otherwise it'll seem like you play with your phone at work.]

325
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,150
Okay.

326
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:15,310
[Look, I was wondering if you're available this evening.]

327
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:17,350
[Let's have a dinner together.]

328
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:20,830
Okay. See you then.

329
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:45,230
[I have the hearing loss.]

330
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:48,230
[Sorry. I was talking to my soul mate.]

331
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:18,430
[Tai, can I ask you something?]

332
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:21,430
[You can type back.]

333
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:35,070
[Do you really believe in the soul mate stuff?]

334
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:52,590
[I believe that people who have a hearing loss]

335
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:55,630
[are just fall ill, technically.]

336
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:58,510
[It's linked to the climate when it's raining.]

337
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:01,070
[So, theoretically,]

338
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,670
[it's most likely that]

339
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:06,030
[the fact that two people hear each other when it rains,]

340
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:07,750
[or, the soul mates, like everyone calls.]

341
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:12,110
[is a phenomenon of the matching wavelengths of the two people.]

342
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:16,750
[So, I want to ask your opinion about it.]

343
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:22,710
(Voiceless) You don't have to answer if you don't want to.

344
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:27,110
(Voiceless) So sorry, I asked you some personal stuff.

345
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:44,270
It's nothing. I was listening to you.

346
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,830
But, I don't know how to answer.

347
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,110
(Voiceless) Alright.

348
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:54,940
(Voiceless) I got to go to class.

349
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:59,870
(Voiceless) Bye bye.

350
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,670
Saengtai,

351
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:53,510
where's Lomfon?

352
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:57,230
He went to have a class. He's gone for a while.

353
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,990
I finished my work.

354
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:00,790
I sent you an email.

355
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:04,060
Yay! We finished the work of this month.

356
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:06,750
Saengtai.

357
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:11,830
I think Lomfon...

358
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:17,430
You said a kid is not your type.

359
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:20,430
You said you didn't want to pamper a kid.

360
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:24,190
I didn't mean it like that.

361
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:27,630
I meant you.

362
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,540
What are you talking about?

363
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:53,070
From what I saw,

364
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:56,790
before I went to the restroom,

365
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:00,670
Lomfon definitely has something feelings to you!

366
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:01,830
Bow!

367
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,270
That's nonsense.

368
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:06,910
No, it's not nonsense.

369
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:10,150
I get that from everything.

370
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:13,110
His eyes and his language

371
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:15,670
can not lie.

372
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:16,830
You know what?

373
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:20,230
Stop being so obsessed with that lovey-dovey show.

374
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,390
You know what?

375
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:23,910
Stop saying that I'm lying.

376
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:25,830
Saengtai! Listen to me!

377
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:31,350
I'm going. I don't want to talk to a binge watcher!

378
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,510
Patts...

379
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:53,150
Pa... Patts, why are you here?

380
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:56,310
Do you forget?

381
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:58,110
We would have a dinner together.

382
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:11,030
I'm not eavesdropping but...

383
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:13,150
May you introduce him to me?

384
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:21,060
Um, this is Patts.

385
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:24,150
This is Bow.

386
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,590
Patts...

387
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:34,110
It's Bow.

388
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:36,950
Who's that girl? It's Bow!

389
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:44,190
I've been his close friend since we were in college.

390
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:49,710
Hello, I'm Patts.

391
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,110
Saengtai's soul mate.

392
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,150
Wow.

393
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,990
That's great.

394
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:02,990
Nice to meet you, finally.

395
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:28,750
Oh!

396
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:32,190
Oh, I've got some stuff.

397
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,950
Please excuse me.

398
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:44,630
That's awesome.

399
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,950
Let's go, too.

400
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:09,950
Did you reserve a table somewhere?

401
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,350
Not yet.

402
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:15,030
What do you want to eat?

403
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:20,910
Then, can you come with me to do something first?

404
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:23,710
Sure.

405
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,110
Patts.

406
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,670
What's up?

407
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:16,830
Nothing.

408
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:23,110
I wonder why are there no other customers here?

409
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:26,670
Don't tell me you booked the whole restaurant?

410
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:27,670
Well...

411
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:32,790
How do I tell you?

412
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:36,070
Not like that, really.

413
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:42,350
Please enjoy.

414
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:54,470
Um, just want to let you know, we didn't order more food.

415
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:55,270
Yes.

416
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,190
Got it.

417
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:57,950
This is enough for you.

418
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:02,710
Please enjoy, yeah?

419
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:05,990
They all look delicious.

420
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:08,190
Thank you so much.

421
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:10,389
Please enjoy eating.

422
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:12,590
Go ahead. Help yourself.

423
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:15,590
It will not disappoint you. I promise.

424
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:17,070
Let's eat then.

425
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:25,550
Okay. Thank you.

426
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:34,429
This dish is so good.

427
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:35,630
Yeah.

428
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:37,670
Please eat them all.

429
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:49,110
Tai, your father I didn't think that I'd meet your soul mate one day.

430
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,870
Father?

431
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:05,750
I didn't think you'd reply him for once, in your lifetime.

432
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:13,150
Good afternoon, sir.

433
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:15,910
I'm Patts. That's my real name.

434
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:17,590
I'm 27 years old.

435
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:20,670
Okay. Alright!

436
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:25,750
Take it easy, kid. Sit down.

437
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:26,710
Sit down.

438
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,030
Relax.

439
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:33,270
Enjoy the food, okay?

440
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:35,470
Don't be nervous around me.

441
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:37,030
Don't think too much, OK?

442
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,310
Yes, sir.

443
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,790
Nice too meet you, too.

444
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:44,790
My Dad is a chef.

445
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:47,790
This is his restaurant.

446
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,710
Why didn't you tell me that before?

447
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:55,190
I didn't prepare anything.

448
00:35:55,790 --> 00:36:01,230
Dad asked me not to tell you. He wanted to make a joke.

449
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:02,070
Right?

450
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:02,750
Yes!

451
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:12,310
So, I heard that you are a vet?

452
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,190
Yes, I'm a vet.

453
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:21,990
My workplace is close to Saengtai's.

454
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:23,550
So, that's why we met each other.

455
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,190
Okay.

456
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:28,310
I'm glad you guys did.

457
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:29,310
Very good.

458
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:33,950
So, how far down the road are you?

459
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:36,990
Dad!

460
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:38,630
Why? Can't I ask?

461
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,710
We just started our relationship.

462
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,420
Who asks something like that?

463
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,230
Alright, alright.

464
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:50,230
Take care of him, yeah. He seems like an understanding person.

465
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:52,270
But it's hard to please him.

466
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:54,590
He's different from the other three Saengs.

467
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:58,070
Three Saengs? What does that mean?

468
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:00,790
Saengtai has three siblings.

469
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:04,550
Saengneua, Saengtien and Saengchan.

470
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:07,870
Really?

471
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:12,750
Saengnuea is my big brother.

472
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:15,230
Saengtien and Saengchan are my little brothers.

473
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:18,310
(Mumbling) Wow, four Saengs...

474
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,190
Four Saengs.

475
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:25,350
Actually, I wanted everyone to be here.

476
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:28,350
But, no one is available but Saengtai.

477
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:31,590
I understand them.

478
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:35,430
But for Saengtien, I just don't. He said he had to go play soccer.

479
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:37,470
Doesn't he miss me?

480
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:40,470
-How dare he said this to me.
 -Dad, don't trust him.

481
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:42,790
This morning, he was still in my room.

482
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:44,390
See? This is your son.

483
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:46,190
Like father, like son.

484
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:48,950
Playing soccer? I mean, what about me?

485
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:50,430
Dig in.

486
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:51,470
Okay.

487
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:52,470
Help yourself.

488
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:55,540
This is my signature dish.

489
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:59,510
I cooked it first time for the ambassador in France.

490
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:03,590
You know, he didn't eat anything else.

491
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:04,790
He only ate this spaghetti?

492
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:06,550
He only drank water.

493
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:10,830
-You're humorous, sir.
 -This is your favorite, try it.

494
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:11,910
Okay.

495
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:15,590
Why do you eat that less?

496
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:17,150
Eat them all.

497
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,830
OK.

498
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:24,190
Hey, you can come here at any time you want.

499
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:26,590
Next month, I'll be out of town.

500
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:29,030
For how long?

501
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:31,550
A month, not that long.

502
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:38,590
My dad took a job arranging catering for the ambassador.

503
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:41,550
That's very cool.

504
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:45,190
I can't stay still.

505
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:47,590
I'll feel bored then.

506
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,230
I need a travel.

507
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:50,830
Okay.

508
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:52,510
We got to go, dad.

509
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:54,150
Okay. Bye then.

510
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,710
It's going to rain. Go.

511
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:58,750
May I go to the restroom first?

512
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:01,150
Sure. That way.

513
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,990
Have you met your mom recently?

514
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,510
Yeah.

515
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,630
Good.

516
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:25,230
Do you know about her re-marriage?

517
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:27,230
I do.

518
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:31,470
It's good for her.

519
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:34,430
Nu is a good man.

520
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:37,310
Do you really think so?

521
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:39,910
Yes.

522
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:42,150
Here we go again.

523
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:46,510
Why does everyone always think that nothing had happened?

524
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:52,230
I know you still love mom.

525
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:54,260
Why do you lie to yourself?

526
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:59,430
I do still love your mom.

527
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:02,390
I don't lie to myself for that.

528
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:06,350
And, I'm glad for her.

529
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:11,030
I don't lie to myself for that, either.

530
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:15,230
I still don't get it.

531
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:18,070
You still love mom, but why...

532
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:19,070
I'm done.

533
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:27,830
Yes, you guys go. It's about to rain.

534
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:28,790
Alright. We're off.

535
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:29,230
Okay.

536
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,270
Good bye.

537
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:31,660
Bye.

538
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:34,270
Patts.

539
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:38,070
Yes?

540
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:40,900
I need to tell you something.

541
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,070
Yes?

542
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:51,350
When we reach the point in our life,

543
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:54,190
maybe the point where we've grown up,

544
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:59,510
you'll realize love is not enough to be together with your loved one.

545
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:03,950
But, I trust that you two are meant to be together.

546
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:06,790
You guys will make it.

547
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:09,750
Yes.

548
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:12,030
Okay. Go home.

549
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:13,790
Take care of Tai, please.

550
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:16,550
Take care of yourself, okay?

551
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:18,390
Thank you, sir.

552
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:19,430
Bye, bye.

553
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:32,230
Are you okay, Patts?

554
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:34,390
Yeah.

555
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:36,230
The dinner was superb.

556
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,790
You didn't even tell me

557
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:41,270
that your father is a chef, a good chef.

558
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:46,710
I'll just go to your dad's very often.

559
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:03,990
Patts, you heard the conversation between me and my dad, right?

560
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:09,470
Yeah, I did.

561
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:16,270
I'm sorry. I ruined the vibe.

562
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:19,950
No. Not at all, Tai.

563
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:28,630
About your siblings though,

564
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:32,750
I can't believe that you have three brothers.

565
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:36,430
What are they like?

566
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:43,950
Neua, he is my big brother.

567
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:46,070
He's kind when he's kind.

568
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:50,670
When he's angry, you can guess...

569
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:54,590
Tien's just like that.

570
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:55,870
He's always crazy.

571
00:42:58,030 --> 00:42:59,670
But, he is the closest to me.

572
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:02,310
Maybe because we always hang out together.

573
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:04,390
And Chan is my little brother.

574
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:06,630
He lives with mom, so I don't see him a lot.

575
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:14,830
After my parents separated, Nuea and Tien lived with dad.

576
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:16,670
Chan and I lived with mom.

577
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:21,510
But, we're still in contact with each other.

578
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:32,270
Tai.

579
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:41,950
Let me ask you this question.

580
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:48,230
Does the relationship between your mom and dad...

581
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:50,950
still affect your thought of the soul mates?

582
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:57,070
-Dad!
 -Well...

583
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:58,550
Dad! Wait!

584
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:03,590
What happened between mom and dad still lingers around.

585
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:05,990
It never goes away.

586
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:11,350
Dad!

587
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:20,110
I tried to cure my hearing loss.

588
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:23,230
I wanted to be a normal man.

589
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:31,230
But, I don't want to be that normal anymore.

590
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:06,910
Thank you, Patts.

591
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:10,510
Thank you, too.

592
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:34,150
Let's get in the car?

593
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:39,150
Maybe my place? We are almost there.

594
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:41,430
Your car is quite far from us.

595
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:44,590
So I can get into your place?

596
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:47,750
Um, yeah.

597
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:50,670
Let's go.

598
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:56,030
Tai, here. We won't get wet then.

599
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:39,780
You change your shoes first.

600
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:40,910
Okay.

601
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:53,070
My room is a bit messy. I'm sorry.

602
00:46:57,510 --> 00:46:59,150
No, it doesn't.

603
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:02,750
Not as neat as your place.

604
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:09,150
(Meow)

605
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:13,950
Duer...

606
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:27,710
I've been a vet for so long,

607
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:30,030
but I have never envied a cat as much as I do now.

608
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:44,550
You want to get changed?

609
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:46,180
I'll go get you the dry clothes.

610
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:47,270
Okay.

611
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:12,390
These are my biggest clothes.

612
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:23,190
Thank you.

613
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:28,790
Where's the bathroom?

614
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:32,550
The left side.

615
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:51,710
Tai, do you have a bath towel...

616
00:48:55,470 --> 00:48:56,870
I'm sorry!

617
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:10,670
Tai, do you have a bath towel?

618
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:27,230
Here you are.

619
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:30,990
Thank you.

620
00:49:51,350 --> 00:49:53,830
I wanted you to go to Doi Mae Pliang.

621
00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:56,630
A Veterinary Volunteering Camp.

622
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:58,190
Are you thinking what I'm thinking now?

623
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:01,630
Your shoulders are so soft.

624
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:04,670
Patts, stop!
