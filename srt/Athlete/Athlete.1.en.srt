(Fighting Fish)
Kingdom: Animalia - Phylum: Chordata
Class: Actinopterygii - Order: Anabantiformes
Family: Osphronemidae - Genus: Betta.

2
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:48,422
Joe Nakamura.

3
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:58,390
Kondo Yohdi.

4
00:01:26,502 --> 00:01:36,762
Males in particular are prone to high levels
of aggression and will attack each other
if housed in the same tank.

5
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,944
Good, everyone. Take five.

6
00:02:45,706 --> 00:02:48,125
Kaido, do you have a sec?

7
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,257
What now?

8
00:02:56,425 --> 00:02:59,177
Com'on. They're just kids.

9
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:03,723
But, we have some
future Olympic-caliber swimmers here...

10
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,308
Open your eyes.

11
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:14,568
Your injury killed a chance to win a medal,
but that's all history.

12
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,989
Don't place your dream onto them.

13
00:03:23,619 --> 00:03:27,038
This is the last warning. Got it?

14
00:03:54,088 --> 00:04:01,679
ATHLETE

15
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,181
I'm home.

16
00:04:26,515 --> 00:04:27,682
Welcome back.

17
00:04:29,268 --> 00:04:30,518
What happened?

18
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:37,776
As I have more students now, I've decided
to move my classroom into a new place.

19
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:39,945
You're doing well.

20
00:04:48,996 --> 00:04:50,372
I want a divorce.

21
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,083
Why so suddenly?

22
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,126
Not suddenly.

23
00:04:55,836 --> 00:04:56,670
A man?

24
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:02,259
He's a part of it, but that's not all.

25
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,136
Yukiko.

26
00:05:07,723 --> 00:05:08,807
I'm home.

27
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,816
You've made up your mind, finally.

28
00:05:18,734 --> 00:05:20,986
Mizuna, you knew it?

29
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:24,281
What?

30
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,117
I'm not that dumb.

31
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,708
I have an appointment, bye.

32
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:03,611
Damn it.

33
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,092
Are you alright?

34
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,245
Welcome.

35
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,540
Morning. Talk to you later.

36
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:40,291
Morning.

37
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:43,837
What's this place?

38
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:47,257
Paradise. The nearest place to heaven.

39
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:55,098
- Gay's...?
- Hey. Call LGBTQ, at least.

40
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,267
Please sit.

41
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:04,607
Male or female, lesbian, gay,
bisexual, transgender, or questioning.

42
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:09,571
Labeling means nothing. This is where
you can be you.

43
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:19,330
Please keep me company for a while.

44
00:08:20,624 --> 00:08:22,167
I'm dumped again.

45
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,419
Hey. Don't scare him off.

46
00:08:24,503 --> 00:08:27,714
Don't worry. I won't bite him.

47
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,176
I'm Mimosa. Good to meet you.

48
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:35,597
Awful. What a boring guy.

49
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:39,767
This is the lady of the house, Priscilla.

50
00:08:40,227 --> 00:08:42,020
Would you care for a drink?

51
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,147
Some liquor, please.

52
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:51,029
What's Yuta to you?
Just a friend, aren't you?

53
00:08:54,366 --> 00:08:57,202
Com'on. Lighten up.

54
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,622
Here you are.

55
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,251
Zubrowka & tonic. Liquor of First Love.

56
00:09:05,794 --> 00:09:08,546
Zubrowka & cranberry juice to me.

57
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:11,466
This is liquor of Lost Love.

58
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,802
You tow look good together.

59
00:09:15,095 --> 00:09:16,179
I know, right?

60
00:09:17,161 --> 00:09:18,246
I'm not...

61
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,893
Anyhow, here's to our meeting.

62
00:09:33,822 --> 00:09:38,076
Oh my... You're cool.

63
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,663
You drink like a man. Cool.

64
00:09:43,832 --> 00:09:45,500
Don't drink too much.

65
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:52,966
Oh my goodness.

66
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,427
Are you alright?

67
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:22,996
Morning.

68
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,541
Scrambled or fried eggs?

69
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:31,421
Don't remember?

70
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:33,756
Where am I?

71
00:10:34,864 --> 00:10:35,698
My room.

72
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,303
I'm Yutaka. Call me Yuta.

73
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:42,181
This... is my roommate, Rusty.

74
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,198
Raping isn't my taste.

75
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:02,785
Sorry.

76
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,040
And?

77
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:12,629
Sunny-side up.

78
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,182
Shower is over there.

79
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:43,761
Can I have one?

80
00:13:17,568 --> 00:13:19,464
Well, I'm off to work.

81
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:25,595
Here's a key. If nowhere else to go.

82
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:31,809
Thank you.

83
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:33,770
See ya.

84
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,150
I knew it.

85
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:10,116
My gratitude. I have a strong sense of duty.

86
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,038
I read your mind.

87
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:17,707
Great.

88
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:21,586
- Let's eat.
- I'll help you.

89
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,756
Looks delicious.

90
00:15:36,893 --> 00:15:42,898
That woman... she waited
until our daughter is about to graduate.

91
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,900
Didn't you expect it?

92
00:15:45,902 --> 00:15:49,488
It's over. I kind of
got married on a whim anyway.

93
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,324
So, why did you?

94
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:02,293
I was lonely.

95
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:09,216
My parents died early and I had only my brother.

96
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,927
I devoted myself to swim,

97
00:16:13,972 --> 00:16:15,765
but I was all alone.

98
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:23,314
So I longed for...

99
00:16:25,233 --> 00:16:27,234
a marriage and a family.

100
00:16:29,404 --> 00:16:33,366
But, you only wanted
to ease the pain of loneliness.

101
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:36,661
Our daughter was the only bond.

102
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:39,955
I hid...

103
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:45,086
my feeling very hard...

104
00:16:48,256 --> 00:16:50,383
to save my family,

105
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:57,098
but it fell apart.

106
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,397
Everything is gone.

107
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,186
I'm Yutaka.
I'm studying to be an animator.

108
00:17:44,771 --> 00:17:51,736
I want to study in France one day,
and Annecy Film Festival is my dream.

109
00:17:54,614 --> 00:17:57,033
What's wrong?
What bothers you?

110
00:17:59,327 --> 00:18:01,996
I've dated two women,

111
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,500
but I might like men more.

112
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,211
I see.

113
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:15,176
I can't choose which, yet.

114
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,431
I guess you don't have to.

115
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,729
Can you put it on hold?
Won't be long.

116
00:18:26,877 --> 00:18:27,878
OK.

117
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,754
Sorry.

118
00:18:34,821 --> 00:18:35,780
Your friend?

119
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,824
A part-time job, "Chat Boy",

120
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,118
until my regular job.

121
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:44,371
Never heard of it.

122
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:49,502
Everybody is lonely and
wants to connect with someone.

123
00:18:51,254 --> 00:18:52,046
You going?

124
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:53,380
Yes.

125
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,966
My turn to make dinner?

126
00:18:56,384 --> 00:18:58,260
I can come home early.

127
00:18:58,512 --> 00:18:59,386
See ya.

128
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:38,134
Dad,

129
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,387
what are you gonna do?

130
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,391
I don't know, yet.

131
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,145
I just want more time to think.

132
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,109
Be a man, dad.

133
00:19:58,029 --> 00:19:58,863
Sorry.

134
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:13,752
Excuse me, where is Yasunori Imaizumi's room?

135
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:16,881
Could you wait a second?

136
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,251
I'm back.

137
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:38,212
Completely drunk?

138
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,760
Hey, what's your name, fish?

139
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,971
Swimmy. I named it.

140
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,347
Swimmy?

141
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:52,810
Leo Lioni's masterpiece!
I really like the book.

142
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:54,979
I will make one like it.

143
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,940
I read it when I was a child.

144
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,113
Are you alright?

145
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:11,954
Swimmy was the only tiny fish
born with a black body.

146
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:16,250
Later, he led a school of fish
using his black body.

147
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:24,550
In the book, Leoni put his message, "everyone has
its character and role in this world."

148
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,387
He put it in there...

149
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:40,691
My father is in a coma.

150
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,656
You should go now.

151
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:48,949
I did.

152
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:51,660
But I couldn't see him.

153
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:55,998
I left home to be an animator 10 years ago.

154
00:22:56,875 --> 00:23:00,044
I just couldn't tell him that... I'm gay.

155
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:07,676
I wanted to say it face to face when I become a pro.

156
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:10,679
But...

157
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,604
You've been working very hard.

158
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:25,903
I haven't reached the start line, yet.
I have nothing to show.

159
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,364
Still...

160
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:30,074
I'm scared...

161
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:39,375
of seeing his face when I tell him I'm gay.

162
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:46,173
What would I do if he says that I'm creepy?

163
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,514
I think about those things.

164
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:56,934
It scares me.

165
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,021
I just can't...

166
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:07,022
I go to Annecy.

167
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:12,236
A lagoon city and holy ground of animation.

168
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:19,076
Shall we?

169
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:28,919
Promise.

170
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:12,296
Are you OK?

171
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:28,270
Drinking?

172
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:31,273
Yes. Quite a lot.

173
00:27:31,607 --> 00:27:33,817
- Quite a lot?
- I still have memory.

174
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,694
You always lose it.

175
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:37,279
Here you are.

176
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:47,622
You're settled in, aren't you?

177
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:49,458
What?

178
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:52,419
I mean you seem to find yourself.

179
00:27:54,130 --> 00:28:00,010
I guess I've only seen
the half of this world in my life.

180
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:01,887
You got that right.

181
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:06,141
Nothing like "this should be this"
or "that has to be that."

182
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:07,726
I think so too...

183
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:12,647
because I feel livelier than before.

184
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:16,193
That's natural.
Being natural is good.

185
00:28:18,654 --> 00:28:19,863
You suck.

186
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:31,208
Hey.

187
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:35,045
- Hey. Wanna leave?
- No, I'll drink with you.

188
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:37,339
Another one, please.

189
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:43,178
Hey, why don't you join us?

190
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:48,809
Well, OK.

191
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:55,941
- What are you drinking?
- Same as usual.

192
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:57,818
The same one, please.

193
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:16,253
About the rent, let me pay my half.

194
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:19,423
Are you sure?

195
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:23,802
I've decided to live with you.

196
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:44,739
Take a break.

197
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:09,556
Well, it was pretty delicious,
but that's all.

198
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,476
You seemed to enjoy it.

199
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:15,437
The rating was 3.8 of 5 on the Net.

200
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:21,735
We're home.

201
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:27,032
This is too big, isn't it?

202
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:38,502
Some flour on your face.

203
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,795
- Here.
- Really?

204
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:45,509
Why on your face?

205
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,144
No, stop.

206
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:12,494
I heard this fish is too territorial
to live in the same tank.

207
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:15,163
If in the same tank?

208
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:20,377
They fight until one of them is
completely wasted.

209
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,465
This is beautiful?

210
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:30,053
Yes. It's wearing a burning red dress.

211
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:31,972
I see.

212
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:33,807
Red.

213
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:46,403
I'm partial color blind.
It's difficult for me to detect red.

214
00:31:46,862 --> 00:31:47,529
Red?

215
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:52,492
What color do you see is sunset?
How about blood?

216
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:57,664
If you ask me, I'll say, red.

217
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:04,129
But is it different from what I see?

218
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:07,591
Maybe, it is.

219
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:13,722
I wonder what the world you see is like.

220
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:37,412
What's wrong?
You don't wanna do now?

221
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,579
What are you doing?

222
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,638
What's going on? Tarot?

223
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,973
I am wondering...

224
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:40,475
About Yutaka?

225
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:47,482
He sometimes seems lonely
even if we are together.

226
00:33:47,983 --> 00:33:50,402
We all are alone, aren't we?

227
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:52,946
But...

228
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,950
I saw that guy.

229
00:33:57,618 --> 00:34:00,787
The boy who was a male prostitute.

230
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:04,499
Yuta... Yutaka.

231
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:07,794
He had nice ass.

232
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:11,548
He was very sensitive.

233
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:18,805
What?

234
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:26,229
His boyfriend? Is that it?

235
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:29,816
That means we are all brothers, right?

236
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:31,985
What do you want?

237
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:35,280
Shut your mouth, bustard.

238
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:39,242
You are too coward to do anything on your own.

239
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:41,161
What? You whore.

240
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:43,830
Be quiet.

241
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,583
I'm hungover.

242
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,002
Get out,

243
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:52,589
or call the police.

244
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:58,136
Don't beg us to come back.

245
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:04,142
Well done.

246
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,686
No match for Priscilla.

247
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:11,900
Yuta.

248
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,715
You thought...

249
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:40,220
that I'm filthy?

250
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,347
Of course not.

251
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:46,476
By the way, the other day...

252
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:51,523
A liar.

253
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:53,775
No, I'm not.

254
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:56,069
Whatever...

255
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:25,807
Are you going out?

256
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,768
Yes, sorry.

257
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:32,063
We're supposed to go fishing.

258
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:36,526
Sorry, l promise to see my daughter.

259
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,822
I get it. OK.

260
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:42,532
Enjoy.

261
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:47,662
Very sorry. I'll make it up to you.

262
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:09,726
Long time no see.

263
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,854
Atsushi, where've you been?

264
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:16,524
What? You sound depressed.

265
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:19,152
Yeah, a little.

266
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:28,453
I see. It sounds really rough
to be rejected so clearly.

267
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:35,835
Well, I kind of knew
that he and I live in different worlds.

268
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:39,297
Kohei has a family.

269
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:42,467
You have a family too, don't you?

270
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:47,597
Yes, but we live apart.
Also, they don't know who I really am.

271
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:53,353
It could be true that there is a wall between us.

272
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,940
Because he's straight?

273
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:07,367
Com'on. "Sex doesn't matter. We are all
human beings." That is your theory, isn't it?

274
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:14,082
What do you say to catch up tonight?

275
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:19,796
How about the usual place?

276
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:33,476
Take care.

277
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:13,224
That movie was really good, wasn't it.

278
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:16,686
How's it going?

279
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:20,565
Is that him?

280
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:22,942
Let me introduce you.

281
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:28,740
I'm Atsushi.

282
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:35,246
I heard a lot about you.

283
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,874
He runs a film company.

284
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:40,877
It a small one for indie films.

285
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:44,297
Good to meet you.

286
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,133
Want to join us?

287
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:49,010
No, not today.

288
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:52,597
You must excuse me.

289
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:54,015
What? Now?

290
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:57,018
See you soon.

291
00:39:58,604 --> 00:39:59,312
See ya.

292
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:01,189
Enjoy.

293
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:19,916
Croatia? No, I haven't seen it.

294
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:26,047
I really like that kind of movie. I wanna see it.

295
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:34,889
You have tickets for previewing?
Thanks, Atsushi. When do I think is the best?

296
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:46,776
Mmm... let me see...

297
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:51,656
- Did you see the TV program?
- Yes, it was interesting.

298
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,368
Good afternoon.

299
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:01,499
- I heard that he is gay.
- Creepy.

300
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:03,334
Go to hell.

301
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,936
You drink too much.

302
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:25,773
I just make the most of my life.

303
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:27,942
Whatever you say.

304
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:33,656
Animals instinctively try
to exclude different ones.

305
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:38,244
Discrimination and prejudice
will never go away.

306
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:42,415
But you're gonna lose if you get desperate.

307
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:49,255
You're right. You're the only one
who understands me, Atsushi.

308
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:07,542
An all-nighter?

309
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,794
Sorry, did I wake you up?

310
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:22,765
With who?

311
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,524
Can't you say who?

312
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:35,528
None of your business.

313
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:38,281
You were with him?

314
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:42,952
Yes.

315
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:44,829
Did you sleep with him?

316
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:49,083
- I did.
- How come?

317
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:51,669
An interrogation?

318
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:57,925
Because I love him.

319
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:03,806
Not only with him but...

320
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:04,682
Stop.

321
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,105
What's so funny?

322
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:15,026
Atsushi was great.

323
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:20,531
He knows everything of me.
He knows how to make me come.

324
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:25,411
That's what it is.

325
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,164
What?

326
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:32,877
You toyed a straight man like me, huh?

327
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,047
You must've had fun.

328
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:38,883
You whore.

329
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:46,015
Is that your answer?

330
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:51,479
You suck.

331
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,608
You don't understand me at all.

332
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:34,939
Hello?

333
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:38,526
How are you?
This is Atsushi, Yutaka's...

334
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:40,111
Ah, yes.

335
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:43,406
Is he at home?
I can't reach him.

336
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:46,325
Why do I know where he is?

337
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:47,493
What?

338
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:50,621
Weren't you with him?

339
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:54,375
No, I took the last flight to Hong Kong.

340
00:45:55,127 --> 00:46:00,840
Could you let him know
that a director is interested in his works?

341
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:04,218
Are you there?

342
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:06,721
Yes. I will.

343
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:12,393
I'll give you some advice.
You'd better leave him.

344
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:16,564
You two will never understand each other.

345
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:40,439
That's all for today.

346
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:42,191
Thank you.

347
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:44,777
See you.

348
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:10,928
Makoto?

349
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:15,516
What's wrong?

350
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:17,977
Coach,

351
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:22,523
why are people born?

352
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:25,818
It's a tough question.

353
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:30,364
Because people love each other.

354
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:32,533
So, what's love?

355
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:38,414
To like someone a lot.

356
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:45,963
So, what do you mean "to like"? Who's someone?
Why are babies born from love?

357
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:07,860
I love a very positive movie like this.

358
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:14,283
The main guy falls in love with a poor actress.
Then he sings a love song in the rain.

359
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:16,285
He glorifies love.

360
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:20,289
What is love, anyway?

361
00:49:21,374 --> 00:49:25,544
I wouldn't cry every night if I knew it.

362
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:32,009
I took a marriage with a love one for granted.

363
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:36,889
But I couldn't love
someone I had a daughter with.

364
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:44,355
I love my daughter for sure,
but Yuta is...

365
00:49:45,607 --> 00:49:47,608
I don't know about that.

366
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:49,485
Listen, Priscilla.

367
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:53,322
I have finally found the last love.

368
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:55,908
Congrats. I'm happy for you.

369
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:57,326
Stop it.

370
00:49:57,911 --> 00:50:01,747
This is Cherry.
We'll get married.

371
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:04,041
It's true this time.

372
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:05,584
OK, OK.

373
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:07,670
Hey, hey, hey.

374
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:12,049
Great, it's the taste of love.

375
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:14,969
Congratulations. I envy you.

376
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:16,220
Hey, you.

377
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,390
I heard Yuta's gone.

378
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:21,100
Yes.

379
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:24,895
If you don't catch him now,
you won't forever.

380
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:30,776
You must live more positively.

381
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:38,701
Priscilla!?

382
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:41,328
Oh my god.

383
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:46,625
I'm fine. I just need to take medicine.

384
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:52,423
Don't worry about me.
I just need to take care of your stuff.

385
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:53,799
I'm fine.

386
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:38,469
Dad?

387
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:43,724
Can I live with you?

388
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:46,727
What?

389
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:53,442
Mom has a new boyfriend,
and they move in together.

390
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:57,613
I feel there's no room for me.

391
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:02,576
I'll help you with some housework.

392
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:04,328
No need.

393
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,750
Do you also live with a Woman?

394
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:14,046
No, it's not that...

395
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:32,064
Your friend?

396
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:33,732
Yes...

397
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:49,540
Long time no see.

398
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,500
Long time no see.

399
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:54,336
Yesterday, I went back home...

400
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:57,840
Your daughter?

401
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,759
Yes, this is Mizuna.

402
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:04,680
It's very nice to meet you.

403
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:08,142
Well, this is...

404
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:13,105
I'm Yutaka. Yutaka Imaizumi.

405
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:17,401
He's been helping me a lot.

406
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:18,527
I see.

407
00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:23,782
So, I get going.

408
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:31,373
Mizuna, can you wait here for me?

409
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:38,130
Yuta.

410
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:40,257
Hey.

411
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:42,676
Wait.

412
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:45,971
Listen to me.

413
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:50,976
- Am I embarrassing you?
- No. But...

414
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:54,146
Are you ashamed of our relationship?

415
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:57,858
No, but I don't know how to tell her.

416
00:53:58,151 --> 00:53:59,193
So what?

417
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:03,113
You can't change who I am.

418
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:10,120
People label others.
People ignore different values.

419
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:15,209
Otherwise, they can't survive.
Because they feel unsettled.

420
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:20,631
I thought you would be different.

421
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:39,019
Kaido.

422
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:41,980
Hey.

423
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:04,920
You can't live in the same tank, huh?

424
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:20,764
Hey, did you see them?

425
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:23,350
I did. Yuck.

426
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:25,852
They make me puke.

427
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:28,605
Hey,

428
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:31,775
What's so funny?

429
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:33,944
Really creepy, aren't they?

430
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:37,530
Lefties are creepy, too?
Any difference?

431
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:38,907
Huh?

432
00:59:39,867 --> 00:59:42,786
We work our guts out and pay taxes.

433
00:59:43,037 --> 00:59:45,163
We don't commit any crimes.

434
00:59:45,623 --> 00:59:48,625
Nothing assholes like you can insult us.

435
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:51,544
Are you a fag, too?

436
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:53,880
What's wrong with it?

437
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:55,674
Apologize.

438
00:59:57,969 --> 00:59:58,969
Say sorry.

439
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:00,345
To whom?

440
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:01,263
Stop.

441
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:02,973
Stop.

442
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:07,686
What a hell?

443
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:27,831
What's wrong? You look pitiful.

444
01:00:28,666 --> 01:00:30,542
Priscilla, you're rude.

445
01:00:32,837 --> 01:00:35,088
Is she coming lately?

446
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:39,009
Rinka? I haven't seen her recently.

447
01:00:39,927 --> 01:00:45,932
I think I'm going to ask her out.
I don't think she will. She's straight.

448
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:48,518
Maybe, you're right.

449
01:00:49,562 --> 01:00:54,316
It may sound exaggerated,
but I want to do anything for her.

450
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:57,861
I think I should tell her my feeling.

451
01:00:59,113 --> 01:01:01,406
I hope she will show up soon.

452
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:05,118
Speak of the devil.

453
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:09,289
Priscilla, this is a souvenir for you.

454
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:11,124
Thank you, Rinka.

455
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:12,709
From Kagoshima.

456
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:16,004
- Soup stock?
- Very delicious.

457
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:17,422
I'll make soup.

458
01:01:17,882 --> 01:01:18,715
Thank you.

459
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:20,425
Let's go over there.

460
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,427
OK. Let's drink.

461
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:25,305
I can't wait to eat her soup.

462
01:01:29,602 --> 01:01:33,021
Well, now it's your turn.

463
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:38,360
Young people are really honest and fearless.

464
01:01:41,322 --> 01:01:43,865
You think my life is a mistake?

465
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:49,037
I got married to ease the pain of loneliness.

466
01:01:50,623 --> 01:01:53,625
That was just my self-satisfaction.

467
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:58,797
That means your wife is too poor.
There was surely love.

468
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:03,593
Otherwise, you wouldn't have a daughter.

469
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:07,806
But eventually it was twisted and gone.

470
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:19,359
Your daughter?

471
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:26,116
My adopted daughter, but I haven't
seen her for about three years.

472
01:02:27,701 --> 01:02:31,037
We shouldn't regret our lives, should we?

473
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:36,501
I think that we all are athletes.

474
01:02:37,378 --> 01:02:43,716
We're worried, get hurt and sometimes laugh.
And we work very hard to survive.

475
01:02:45,386 --> 01:02:49,347
I think that is what matters most.

476
01:02:50,141 --> 01:02:52,684
I'm gonna try again, too.

477
01:02:53,811 --> 01:02:54,727
Wish me luck.

478
01:03:02,653 --> 01:03:06,739
Makoto, why do you always
sneak around to change?

479
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:12,996
What? Do you wanna fight? Com'on!

480
01:03:12,997 --> 01:03:14,956
Don't you have a dick?

481
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:22,130
Makoto is gay. Makoto is gay.

482
01:03:23,841 --> 01:03:24,757
Stop it.

483
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:38,104
Why don't you fight back?

484
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:40,732
It means I lose.

485
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:48,323
I wanna be strong.

486
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:54,579
Really, really...

487
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:57,499
strong.

488
01:04:32,076 --> 01:04:33,952
Sorry for asking you out.

489
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:38,498
I'll forgive you if you go shopping with me.

490
01:04:44,922 --> 01:04:47,674
What? What's wrong, dad?

491
01:04:51,929 --> 01:04:56,224
There's someone I love.

492
01:05:00,187 --> 01:05:02,355
A little hard to tell you...

493
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:06,651
I love a man.

494
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:10,572
Seriously?

495
01:05:14,368 --> 01:05:17,829
Is it the man I met the other day?

496
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:28,256
Are you... un... gay, too?

497
01:05:29,675 --> 01:05:30,967
I don't know.

498
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:33,136
But...

499
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:37,265
I've just realized I love him.

500
01:05:45,691 --> 01:05:47,233
Can't you bear?

501
01:05:50,529 --> 01:05:51,571
I'm not sure.

502
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:01,873
But I think...

503
01:06:03,834 --> 01:06:06,461
he is better than mom's boyfriend.

504
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:08,463
Good.

505
01:06:40,913 --> 01:06:43,623
Yutaka? I don't know.

506
01:06:44,041 --> 01:06:48,920
I only chatted him a couple of
times with this app.

507
01:06:49,213 --> 01:06:54,509
No, I haven't seen him.
I was wondering about him lately.

508
01:06:54,885 --> 01:06:55,802
I'm sorry.

509
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:59,639
But I'll ask around.

510
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:04,394
Thank you. My contact number is...

511
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:23,371
Yutaka?

512
01:07:28,252 --> 01:07:32,338
The doctor says dad will
only live for a few days.

513
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:38,428
Since mom died, he used to
talk a lot about you.

514
01:07:42,266 --> 01:07:44,267
So, just come back home.

515
01:07:58,991 --> 01:08:02,118
"Atsushi".

516
01:08:08,292 --> 01:08:09,667
Oh, it's you.

517
01:08:10,127 --> 01:08:13,463
I've found someone who knows about Yutaka.

518
01:08:15,048 --> 01:08:16,591
Where is the guy?

519
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:26,893
I saw Yuta once three days ago.
He looked wasted.

520
01:08:28,312 --> 01:08:29,187
And?

521
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:33,149
He said he was going to face his father.

522
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:36,861
Where is his hometown?

523
01:08:37,029 --> 01:08:40,323
Maybe seaside. In Chiba...

524
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:42,158
Yes, Katsuura.

525
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:52,710
Please.

526
01:08:54,087 --> 01:08:55,880
Bring him back to me.

527
01:08:58,467 --> 01:09:00,468
I'll take him to France.

528
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:24,742
Yutaka, I'm going to a shop.

529
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:47,348
Dad, can you hear me?

530
01:09:56,108 --> 01:09:56,941
I am...

531
01:10:00,404 --> 01:10:02,238
I'm a little different.

532
01:10:08,787 --> 01:10:12,957
I couldn't say it
when I was in junior high school.

533
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:20,840
I was scared...

534
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:25,261
of being denied.

535
01:10:28,265 --> 01:10:31,559
That's why I ran away.

536
01:10:39,693 --> 01:10:40,526
I...

537
01:10:53,624 --> 01:10:55,291
I like men.

538
01:11:05,302 --> 01:11:07,887
Sorry for not telling you this.

539
01:11:20,567 --> 01:11:24,612
I said sorry, so say something.

540
01:11:31,328 --> 01:11:32,954
You heard me, right?

541
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:39,502
Say something.

542
01:11:42,047 --> 01:11:43,047
Please.

543
01:11:55,686 --> 01:11:57,770
Sorry for being such a son.

544
01:12:02,776 --> 01:12:03,776
I'm sorry.

545
01:12:21,295 --> 01:12:22,295
Sorry...

546
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:43,941
I've been searching for you.

547
01:12:51,658 --> 01:12:53,951
I came here to pick you up.

548
01:12:56,413 --> 01:12:57,330
Go home.

549
01:13:00,167 --> 01:13:02,710
You should be with your daughter.

550
01:13:04,421 --> 01:13:06,672
We live in different worlds.

551
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:18,434
A while ago, you asked me
about the world I see.

552
01:13:24,024 --> 01:13:26,442
That's something no one knows.

553
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:32,865
We don't understand others completely.

554
01:13:33,742 --> 01:13:34,617
But,

555
01:13:36,036 --> 01:13:42,708
I believe we can overcome a wall
of individual difference with wisdom.

556
01:13:45,295 --> 01:13:46,212
So,

557
01:13:47,923 --> 01:13:50,591
bet on that possibility for now.

558
01:17:44,242 --> 01:17:48,579
One year later.

559
01:17:55,253 --> 01:17:57,588
This is Kaido. How are you?

560
01:17:58,590 --> 01:18:00,007
What did they say?

561
01:18:01,843 --> 01:18:03,427
Really? Great.

562
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:06,889
Could you prepare for a dinner?

563
01:18:08,433 --> 01:18:11,060
Thank you. Talk to you later.

564
01:18:14,481 --> 01:18:17,775
"Mimosa".

565
01:18:21,488 --> 01:18:22,446
Hello?

566
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:30,871
Where's your tie?

567
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:33,332
I got ahead of myself.

568
01:18:37,087 --> 01:18:39,922
Wow! You really got married.

569
01:18:43,051 --> 01:18:48,222
In Hawaii. We tied the knot in Hawaii.

570
01:18:49,891 --> 01:18:51,600
How about you two?

571
01:18:53,687 --> 01:18:56,647
The best friends.
It is fine, too I guess.

572
01:18:56,815 --> 01:18:57,940
Yeah, exactly.

573
01:18:58,233 --> 01:18:59,191
I see.

574
01:18:59,776 --> 01:19:01,777
You look good together, right.

575
01:19:01,945 --> 01:19:02,945
Really?

576
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:03,779
Yes.

577
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:08,325
Long time no see.

578
01:19:08,493 --> 01:19:11,370
Hi Kaido, good to see you again.

579
01:19:21,047 --> 01:19:22,214
Her daughter?

580
01:19:22,799 --> 01:19:26,218
Thank you for being friends of my mother.

581
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:29,972
Priscilla's daughter?

582
01:19:30,348 --> 01:19:30,973
Yes.

583
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:32,975
Did you guys know her?

584
01:19:33,226 --> 01:19:34,143
No.

585
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:36,979
Such a pretty girl...

586
01:19:40,859 --> 01:19:42,526
Yutaka is in Paris.

587
01:19:43,653 --> 01:19:47,364
He said he doesn't need
my help and left alone.

588
01:19:48,241 --> 01:19:49,241
I see.

589
01:20:00,545 --> 01:20:03,005
She was the worst mother.

590
01:20:04,007 --> 01:20:05,716
As she earned little,

591
01:20:06,259 --> 01:20:11,388
she worked day and night
not to allow me to live uncomfortably.

592
01:20:12,307 --> 01:20:14,475
For the adopted daughter.

593
01:20:18,271 --> 01:20:24,610
When I had a boyfriend, she said he was
bad for me and objected to our dating.

594
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:28,113
So. I ran away with him.

595
01:20:29,449 --> 01:20:31,575
Soon after,

596
01:20:33,870 --> 01:20:35,746
he ran away.

597
01:20:36,289 --> 01:20:38,207
She was right about him.

598
01:20:38,875 --> 01:20:40,501
How annoying.

599
01:20:42,337 --> 01:20:44,171
She scolded me once.

600
01:20:45,006 --> 01:20:51,303
I asked her advice on piercing.
She said don't hurt the body my parents gave.

601
01:20:51,763 --> 01:20:54,765
She supported to take it off, though.

602
01:20:56,059 --> 01:20:59,603
I always thought of her
as a mother in Tokyo,

603
01:21:00,146 --> 01:21:03,440
but one day she said she was from Hyogo.

604
01:21:06,069 --> 01:21:07,778
What a woman.

605
01:21:08,613 --> 01:21:11,365
She understood us completely,

606
01:21:12,158 --> 01:21:16,370
but we don't understand her at all.

607
01:21:29,259 --> 01:21:32,344
This is the song Priscilla loved.

608
01:21:42,939 --> 01:21:44,064
I remember it.

609
01:21:44,232 --> 01:21:45,107
I do, too.

610
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:47,276
I listened to it a lot.

611
01:23:55,488 --> 01:23:57,239
I knew you would come.

612
01:24:00,243 --> 01:24:01,243
For now.

613
01:24:14,215 --> 01:24:18,802
Kohei Kaido: Joe Nakamura

614
01:24:19,554 --> 01:24:24,141
Yutaka Imaizumi: Kondo Yohdi.

615
01:25:18,738 --> 01:25:31,166
Priscilla: Yoshiaki Umegaki.

616
01:27:36,876 --> 01:27:50,889
Ending theme song by GOW.

01:28:05,238 --> 01:28:17,791
