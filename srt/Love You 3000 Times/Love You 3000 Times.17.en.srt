[Episode 17]

3
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,500
About that car accident,

4
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,970
it's very likely

5
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:38,539
Jiang Muyi will have new memories resurfacing.

6
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:40,740
She might remember everything one day.

7
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,880
Why don't you go tell her?

8
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,550
You're the one who did it all.

9
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:48,970
You think you can escape?

10
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,240
We've long been in the same boat.

11
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,940
How dare you threaten me?

12
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:02,930
Mr. Jiang,

13
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:03,530
Mr. Jiang,

14
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:04,270
I was wrong.

15
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:04,790
I was wrong.

16
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,010
I misspoke just now.

17
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:06,610
I made a mistake.

18
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:07,560
Please give me another chance.

19
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,190
Just one more chance.

20
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:08,770
Just one.

21
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:09,300
That's all I ask.

22
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,130
I'm really at the end of my rope.

23
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:10,620
Mr. Jiang,

24
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,060
just…

25
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,880
just one more chance,

26
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,670
okay?

27
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,720
Will you ever stop?

28
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,180
In here

29
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,579
is the recording

30
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,280
of me working for you three years ago.

31
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,650
How did you have this?

32
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,790
Zhan Jinjie, you're playing dirty.

33
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,470
Well, you know,

34
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,770
in this line of work,

35
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,079
one always needs an exit strategy.

36
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,030
Just in case something goes wrong someday,

37
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,000
one needs to

38
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,130
have some kind of protection, right?

39
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,170
If you want it,

40
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,480
I still have backups.

41
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,480
After all these years,

42
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,110
even if I don't have any merits,

43
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,030
I should at least get some credit for my hard work,

44
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,000
don't you think?

45
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:07,510
How about this?

46
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,610
You give me some money

47
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,550
to help me get through this difficult time.

48
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,470
In the future,

49
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,910
I'll still loyally work for you.

50
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,980
You don't need to be too nervous.

51
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,150
As for the recording,

52
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,790
I'll keep it safe for now.

53
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:31,800
It's just that,

54
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,730
if your sister happens to hear the recording one day,

55
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,010
do you think

56
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:36,930
you

57
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,600
would still be okay?

58
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,050
What is this?

59
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,500
This is a recording

60
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,130
about three years ago, kept by Zhan Jinjie.

61
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,120
I'll give you three million.

62
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,500
Make Jiang Muyi disappear completely.

63
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,940
Keep it clean.

64
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,290
Don't leave any traces.

65
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,840
What do you plan to do?

66
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,030
I want to pay him off

67
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,269
to keep him quiet.

68
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,890
Will that solve the problem?

69
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,540
I-I've checked.

70
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,600
If this gets exposed,

71
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,440
neither of us can get away with it.

72
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,240
Besides, if my sister finds out,

73
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,720
I'll be doomed.

74
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,330
I'll take away the stuff.

75
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,420
As for the rest,

76
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,480
I'll handle it.

77
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,500
Mr. He,

78
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,920
why did you come here alone…

79
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,940
Why did you tamper with Jiang Muyi's hypnosis?

80
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:04,790
Mr. He,

81
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,470
is there some misunderstanding between us?

82
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,470
Misunderstanding?

83
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:10,100
Why does Jiang Muyi keep having memories of killing someone?

84
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,850
You know better than anyone.

85
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,990
She's someone who doesn't even drink.

86
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,270
Why does she have a lasting memory of drunk driving?

87
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,470
You'd better explain this clearly,

88
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:18,200
Zhan Jinjie.

89
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:20,480
I...

90
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,420
I was treating her,

91
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,870
making her remember

92
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,400
things she had seen before,

93
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,030
to help her relax.

94
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,990
That was my treatment plan.

95
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,920
What a ridiculous treatment plan!

96
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,880
Then tell me,

97
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,620
why did you meet Jiang Sensen secretly at night?

98
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,600
He is...

99
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,630
He is Jiang Muyi's younger brother.

100
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,909
I was telling him about his sister.

101
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:42,770
There's nothing wrong with that.

102
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,050
Still playing tough, huh?

103
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:48,070
Are you going to talk or not?

104
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,270
Are you going to talk?

105
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,010
Speak up!

106
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,780
I'll talk.

107
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,720
Talk!

108
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:58,650
Jiang Sensen...

109
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,470
he...

110
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,300
gave me three million.

111
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,160
He wanted me

112
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,270
to tamper with

113
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,290
Jiang Muyi's car.

114
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,320
Three years ago,

115
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,590
I was instructed by Jiang Sensen and Jin Minmin

116
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,200
to harm Jiang Muyi.

117
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,610
According to the plan,

118
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,090
I tampered with the brakes

119
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,220
of Jiang Muyi's car.

120
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,070
I don't know why

121
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,400
they wanted to hurt her.

122
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,540
I was just doing what I was paid to do.

123
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,530
That day,

124
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,830
I was following Jiang Muyi

125
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,620
and discovered she was being proposed to.

126
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,320
At that moment, I felt a bit of pity for her.

127
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,470
But unexpectedly,

128
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,810
after the accident,

129
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,080
it was Shen Xingchen, her fiancé at the time,

130
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,070
who died.

131
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,690
I had to go along with the situation

132
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,480
by fabricating a drunk driving accident

133
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,590
and quickly hypnotizing her

134
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,060
to make her believe

135
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,510
that she killed Shen Xingchen

136
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,710
because she drove under the influence.

137
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,870
She was imprisoned as a result.

138
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,940
My task was already completed,

139
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:34,590
but I didn't expect her to meet you.

140
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:36,470
You and Shen Xingchen

141
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,030
look exactly the same.

142
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,630
I was worried she'd remember the truth,

143
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,150
so I had no choice but to approach her again

144
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,610
and reinforce her memory.

145
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,750
I know she's pitiful,

146
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,470
but I have no way out anymore.

147
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,840
What about the evidence?

148
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:54,990
Do you have any evidence?

149
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:55,630
No.

150
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,850
Evidence!

151
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:13,440
About that car accident,

152
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,070
it's very likely

153
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,270
Jiang Muyi will have new memories resurfacing.

154
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,470
She might remember everything one day.

155
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:20,930
Why don't you go tell her?

156
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,530
You're the one who did it all.

157
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,800
You think you can escape?

158
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,460
We've long been in the same boat.

159
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,520
How dare you threaten me?

160
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,460
This punch is for Muyi.

161
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,710
She trusted you so.
