00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,590
I'm ready.

4
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:13,840
Open your mouth.

5
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,390
Crooked teeth

6
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,329
with cavities.

7
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,250
Disqualified.

8
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,150
You're staying by my side on purpose, aren't you?

9
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,210
What exactly is your relationship with Shen Xingchen?

10
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,800
If you haven't recognized me,

11
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,760
why would you keep me by your side so easily?

12
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,750
Raise your arms.

13
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,030
98 cm chest.

14
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,130
47 cm shoulder width.

15
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:01,570
Hold it.

16
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,720
Why is your physique so similar to his?

17
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,930
As if Shen Xingchen had come back.

18
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,930
100 cm hips.

19
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,630
You have a thin build

20
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:30,640
as a security guard.

21
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,940
You're even not as well-trained as I am.

22
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,340
You'd better try harder.

23
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,740
There's still room.

24
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,079
What do you mean?

25
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,030
Ms. Jiang means

26
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,890
you need to continue exercising.

27
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,200
So, am I qualified,

28
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,150
Ms. Jiang?

29
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,870
I will definitely find out

30
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,970
who you are.

31
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,500
Barely qualified.

32
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:13,800
Get ready.

33
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:14,910
Come out with me.

34
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:20,360
Jiang Muyi,

35
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:22,950
what exactly are you trying to do?

36
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:27,680
Ms. Jiang, who are you going to meet

37
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,870
since you brought me here?

38
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:29,860
A friend of mine.

39
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:30,950
I'm going to use the restroom.

40
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,210
Wait for me for a while.

43
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,830
one cup of coffee, please.

44
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:43,380
Got it.

45
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,020
Excuse me,

46
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,110
this seat is taken.

47
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:48,840
Hey, handsome,

48
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,050
are you here alone?

49
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,630
I haven't seen you around before.

50
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,280
Isn't this Gao Shenglin?

51
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,520
Why hasn't she recognized me either?

52
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,320
You look so young.

53
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,140
Did you just hook up with a rich lady to come here and live it up?

54
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:03,890
I'm sorry.

55
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:04,850
I don't know you.

56
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,100
Please leave.

57
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,130
Gao Shenglin.

58
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:11,570
Stop messing around.

59
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,130
Gao Shenglin

60
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,150
is my best friend.

61
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,050
She's the owner of the largest recreation club in Langbei City.

62
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,810
She likes to joke around.

63
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,240
Don't take it seriously.

64
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,180
Why are you acting?

65
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,890
Let me introduce you

66
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,560
to my new fiancé,

67
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,630
He Yuchuan.

68
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,120
Ms. Jiang,

69
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,650
at the last gathering,

70
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,870
it wasn't this gentleman, was it?

71
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,100
What a pity.

72
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,650
He's just a bit shy.

73
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,250
He can get some training at my place.

74
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,400
Stop it.

75
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,380
I was just joking earlier.

76
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,460
I apologize

77
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,070
if I offended you.

78
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,460
By the way, I have a high-end private club.

79
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,520
Feel free to come and visit sometime.

80
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,950
It's impossible for the people around her

81
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,540
to fail to recognize me.

82
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,490
Has she been testing me all along?

83
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:18,780
Security Guard.

84
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,230
I heard you were drinking here.

85
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,680
I didn't believe it at first.

86
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,910
Doing pretty well for yourself, huh?

87
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:26,670
You're now wearing a suit,

88
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:28,270
looking all high and mighty.

89
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,300
I have to thank you for that, Mr. Fang.

90
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:33,930
What's the matter, Mr. Fang?

91
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,430
Did you come here especially to see me?

92
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,830
Stop being so shameless.

93
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,380
Come with me for a chat?

94
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,180
Do you dare?

95
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,550
With you?

96
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,310
What's there to be afraid of?

97
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,220
You also think he looks very similar, don't you?

98
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:55,670
Yes, indeed.

99
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,010
It just gave me a fright.

100
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,440
They're practically identical.

101
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,870
But if he were him,

102
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,630
he would have gotten angry just now, wouldn't he?

103
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:06,830
I'll keep testing him.

104
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,330
He Yuchuan,

105
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,330
because of you,

106
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,280
I've lost my status as a fiancé.

107
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:24,900
Listen,

108
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,520
I won't let you off the hook!

109
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,950
Security Guard,

110
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,530
if it weren't for me,

111
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,380
you wouldn't have had the chance to climb the social ladder and be here.

112
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,970
Given your meager abilities,

113
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,170
you don't deserve it!

114
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,620
Getting agitated, huh?

115
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,840
Aren't you just a poor wretch

116
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,620
who's been kicked out by Ms. Jiang?

117
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,020
Who are you referring to?

118
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,910
I dare you to say that again!

119
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,520
Who are you to say that?

120
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,460
What do you want to do?

121
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,710
Ms. Jiang,

122
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:04,990
it's all taken care of.

123
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:06,580
I knew

124
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,050
you'd come to save me.
