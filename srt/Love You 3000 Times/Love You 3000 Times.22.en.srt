00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,890
[Episode 22]

3
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,160
Jiang...

4
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:56,460
Jiang Muyi!

5
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,890
Sensen.

6
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,510
What are you doing?

7
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,850
How much did you get involved in the car accident?

8
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,780
Why did you help outsiders harm me?

9
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,050
I...

10
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:13,820
I don't want to kill you.

11
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,550
But given what happened,

12
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,050
you deserve it!

13
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:20,020
I deserve it?

14
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:23,040
What did I do to make you think of me like this?

15
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,010
You're so amazing.

16
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,590
You've never cared about anyone else.

17
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,650
We're all just your supporting cast.

18
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:30,720
But don't we

19
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,180
deserve to be noticed too?

20
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,990
Dad only likes you.

21
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:35,030
He kept you by his side

22
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,560
but sent me abroad instead.

23
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,230
But I'm also part of the Jiang Family.

24
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,620
Jiang Family is where I belong too!

25
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:43,780
Jiang Sensen.

26
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,250
How could you think like this?

27
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:47,860
You're my own brother.

28
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,350
Jiang Family is where you belong, of course.

29
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,010
Jiang Muyi, can you not make me sick?

30
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,740
Have you ever treated me as your own brother?

31
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,740
Have you?

32
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,640
Sensen.

33
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,720
Don't be too emotional.

34
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,230
Since childhood,

35
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,870
I've never meant to hurt anyone.

36
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,430
But I, as your sister, have neglected your feelings.

37
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,580
It's my fault.

38
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,550
Can you forgive me?

39
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,300
Even if I can forgive you,

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,240
what about Minmin?

41
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:20,970
What did she do wrong?

42
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,190
Why should she live in your shadow?

43
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,520
What do you mean by that?

44
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,710
I don't understand.

45
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,280
What do I mean?

46
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,270
She's always felt that she's not as good as you in anything,

47
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,070
and she's not comparable to you.

48
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:36,390
Maybe it's because you don't understand her.

49
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,740
But I do!

50
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,030
In my heart,

51
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,210
Minmin is the best woman in the world!

52
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,670
You know nothing,

53
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,260
because you have no idea

54
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,560
how dark

55
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,940
the darkness we've experienced is!

56
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,620
Because you're in the sunshine!

57
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,020
You're in the sunshine,

58
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,079
and you have no idea

59
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:53,070
what we are!

60
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,960
What...

61
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,160
I know.

62
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,930
You all look down on me.

63
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,649
I shouldn't have been born into this world.

64
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:22,180
I shouldn't have been born.

65
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:23,840
In your view,

66
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,560
there's always been someone who is a drag on the Jiang Family.

67
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,680
That person is me.

68
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,650
Is it only after I die

69
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,320
that you'll feel

70
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,790
your life is perfect?

71
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,310
Sensen.

72
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,270
You're my own brother.

73
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,909
I admit that all these years,

74
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,090
I haven't cared for you enough.

75
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:46,950
But in my heart,

76
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,610
I've never looked down on you.

77
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,570
Why do you have to compare yourself to me?

78
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,300
You don't need to envy me at all.

79
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,850
You can have your own life.

80
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,950
While there's still time,

81
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,830
let's have a good talk,

82
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,140
okay?

83
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,140
Sister, do you remember?

84
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,600
Back in college,

85
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,520
I failed in my startup.

86
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,230
Everyone in the family looked down on me.

87
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,890
They all thought I was a loser.

88
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,010
I even felt like dying at that time.

89
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:25,560
It was also then

90
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,550
that I met Minmin.

91
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,150
How could you think that way?

92
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,280
No one in the family looked down on you.

93
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,980
It doesn't matter, does it?

94
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,400
You know what?

95
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,070
I've always felt

96
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,570
that I don't deserve to be loved

97
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,430
and I'm not worthy of being liked.

98
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,500
But I really wanted,

99
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,470
really wanted

100
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,820
to experience the feeling of being loved.

101
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,050
Until I met Minmin.

102
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:53,710
At that time,

103
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:54,760
for the first time in my life,

104
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,620
I felt what it was like to be loved.

105
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,090
I know

106
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,030
she had other motives for approaching me initially.

107
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:03,960
But I discovered

108
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,440
that we are both very fragile.

109
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,620
It was like finding a soulmate.

110
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,430
It's very precious

111
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,170
to me.

112
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,450
At that time,

113
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,740
she took me to intern at the Jin Group.

114
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,380
I had just failed in my startup

115
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,910
and had no fighting spirit.

116
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,620
She chatted with me about life and dreams

117
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,950
and encouraged me.

118
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,850
She stayed with me through my darkest times.

119
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,490
At that moment,

120
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,470
I, Jiang Sensen,

121
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,190
swore

122
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:40,740
that

123
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:41,670
I would protect this woman

124
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:42,950
for the rest of my life!

125
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,530
I still remember

126
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,960
how she guided me with her own experiences of failure.

127
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,909
The way she cried

128
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,780
was truly heartbreaking.

129
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,010
Actually, we're quite similar.

130
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,560
Both of us are incredibly fragile,

131
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,460
yet we pretend to be so strong.

132
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,280
I know

133
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,920
you think she's a bad person.

134
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,290
She's just trying to hide her true nature.

135
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,030
I want to protect her.

136
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,700
Because, to me,

137
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,950
she is the most important person.

138
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,820
So you like her, right?

139
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,340
I understand your feelings for her now.

140
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,480
If there's an opportunity now

141
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,560
for you

142
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,190
to know her feelings for you,

143
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:48,250
would you like to try?

144
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,750
They must have gone to the beach.

145
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,520
I will bear all the consequences.

146
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,800
[Jiang Sensen]

147
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,170
Minmin,

148
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,240
I'm ready to make my move.

149
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,110
I know

150
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,230
I am a coward.

151
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,180
[Jiang Sensen has recalled a message]

152
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,570
But because of you,

153
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:13,700
I've become strong.

154
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,690
Don't worry.

155
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,690
I'll take responsibility for everything.

156
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,490
I'll leave with all the secrets

157
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,440
and your pain.

158
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,230
Take care.

159
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,310
Sensen.

160
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,170
Over there!

161
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,020
Jiang Sensen!

162
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,390
Don't come any closer!

163
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,330
If you come any closer, I'll die with her!
