00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,850
[Episode 7]

3
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,600
Where exactly are we going?

4
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,810
You'll know when we arrive there.

5
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,550
I thought that everyone would be quite proactive.

6
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,210
I didn't expect that someone would be late.

7
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,160
I've participated in "Good Husband" so many times.

8
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,560
But this is the first time that I've seen someone arrive late.

9
00:01:57,289 --> 00:01:58,350
Mr. He.

10
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,500
We've

11
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,530
met again.

12
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,700
However, I have a high-end private club.

13
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,600
You can come and have fun there when you have time.

14
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,570
Jiang Muyi.

15
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,280
How's it going?

16
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,510
Have you found out about anything else?

17
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:33,630
I mean,

18
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,100
if it's not okay, you can ask him to participate in "Go for It, Good Husband".

19
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,300
I'll test him for you.

20
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:43,340
Okay.

21
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,030
Please test him thoroughly for me.

22
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,430
Gentlemen, thanks for

23
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,490
signing up for "Go for It, Good Husband".

24
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,570
Next,

25
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,900
you'll be competing for the title of Best Husband.

26
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,670
You will be competing in

27
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:01,270
styling,

28
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:01,830
housekeeping,

29
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:02,750
business negotiations

30
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,750
and other fields.

31
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,540
If there are no questions,

32
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:08,030
please get your uniforms respectively.

33
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:13,680
Take it.

34
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:14,420
Here you are.

35
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,010
Take it.

36
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,030
Thank you.

37
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:18,610
Alright.

38
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,270
Let me introduce myself to you all.

39
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,230
My name is Yuan Bin.

40
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:21,990
I've already participated in

41
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,990
the Good Husband competition three times.

42
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,130
I assume this is your first time participating in it.

43
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:26,910
Don't be nervous.

44
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:27,440
Ms. Tian.

45
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,020
You always want to be the top one in everything.

46
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,480
But your husband isn't competitive enough.

47
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:36,540
This is already his fourth time participating in the competition.

48
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,829
Three times?

49
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:40,840
Then why are you still participating in it?

50
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,930
I told you the reason, didn't I?

51
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,300
I'm here to learn something.

52
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,520
Because the competition system here

53
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,780
is very professional.

54
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,810
What's more, I've heard that

55
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,380
if you can win a medal,

56
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,280
you'll receive a sum of prize money.

57
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,010
Prize money?

58
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:51,670
Yes, yes, yes.

59
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:52,670
What prize money?

60
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,370
It's different each time.

61
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:55,980
But as far as I know,

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,640
as long as you rank first in the final

63
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,650
overall ranking list,

64
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,260
you can win this sum of prize money.

65
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,130
If you want to get this prize money,

66
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,090
you have to work hard.

67
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,580
Don't slack off.

68
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:07,980
It's not easy indeed.

69
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:08,870
Otherwise,

70
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,630
you wouldn't have joined the competition four times.

71
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,550
Right?

72
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:15,890
He Yuchuan!

73
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,110
Come out for a moment.

74
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:35,630
You look

75
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,030
quite well.

76
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,900
I'm sorry that you had to suffer all the way.

77
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,320
Good luck to you.

78
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,740
Please continue.

79
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,340
[Go for It, Good Husband]

80
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,460
I killed Shen Xingchen!

81
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,050
[Go for It, Good Husband]

82
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,550
Is it fun for you to send me here?

83
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,470
I think it's good.

84
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,350
In your eyes,

85
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,080
I'm on call at all times, right?

86
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,150
That's also your

87
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,370
honor.

88
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:36,520
Don't think that you can do whatever you want.

89
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,920
I know everything you've done.

90
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,510
Murderer.

91
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,270
Who on earth are you?

92
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,590
Why did you deliberately get close to me

93
00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:59,870
and stay by my side?

94
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,580
Ms. Jiang.

95
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,310
Who do you think I am?

96
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,750
Since you want to play the game,

97
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,280
I'll definitely play it with you till the end.

98
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,470
You're very brave.

99
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,570
Let's just wait and see.

100
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,940
Wow!

101
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,909
This time, the training camp

102
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:35,570
is really so unique, isn't it?

103
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,280
Do your best.

104
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,390
Maybe your wife is

105
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,350
watching you

106
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,090
somewhere.

107
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,920
Everyone, welcome

108
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,300
to our annual

109
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,780
"Go for It, Good Husband".

110
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,410
Just like previous ones, this year's competition

111
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:02,470
will provide a platform

112
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,510
to show different forms of love.

113
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,870
The gentlemen will go through multiple rounds of challenges.

114
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,060
The one with the highest score

115
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,000
will get the title of Best Husband in this competition

116
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,060
and receive a huge sum of prize money.

117
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,420
At the first round,

118
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,920
the gentlemen will select an outfit from

119
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,300
those clothes on the stage

120
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,030
and then display their styles.

121
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,320
This round

122
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,720
is to test the gentlemen's aesthetic senses

123
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,850
and their ability to present clothes.

124
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,880
The competition

125
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,600
begins now!

126
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,560
This is interesting.

127
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,560
This one is nice.

128
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:40,690
I saw it first.

129
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:41,550
You can take it.

130
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,330
Ms. Jiang,

131
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,620
your boyfriend isn't quite proactive.

132
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,160
If it were you,

133
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,410
you'd definitely remember this outfit, wouldn't you?
