[Episode 18]

3
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,670
-She's coming.
-She's coming.

4
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,310
Ms. Jin.

5
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:46,950
I've heard that the Executive Assistant of the Jiang Group

6
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,539
is going to take over part of the Jin Group's business.

7
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:50,940
Could you please tell us whether it's true?

8
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:52,440
Since everyone is here,

9
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,590
with the presence of the media, I'd like to

10
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,050
announce something, too.

11
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,630
From today onwards,

12
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,340
Bai Long will officially join

13
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,220
the Jin Group.

14
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:00,870
I believe that

15
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,310
after Bai Long joins us,

16
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,390
it will bring more opportunities

17
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,670
and challenges

18
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:05,470
for the Jin Group.

19
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:06,380
Can we take a photo of you

20
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,340
and your sister?

21
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,370
Of course.

22
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:09,520
Come on.

23
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,720
Come on. Look here.

24
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,040
Come on. Look here.

25
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,400
Here. Thanks.

26
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,790
Look over here.

27
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,740
Look here.

28
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,050
Here.

29
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:32,690
Bai Long.

30
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,840
In the future,

31
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,850
I will do everything in my power

32
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:37,840
to make up for the family and love

33
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,040
that you've lacked for all these years.

34
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,430
Thank you for your great kindness, Ms. Jin.

35
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,230
As your younger sister,

36
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,870
I will never forget that.

37
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,940
I'm sorry, everyone.

38
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,510
I have an important phone call.

39
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,390
So everyone,

40
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,190
please chat with Bai Long first.

41
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,140
Excuse me.

42
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,000
Alright, Ms. Jin. Please get back to work first.

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,550
Miss Bai.

44
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,250
Bai Long.

45
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,360
You've found your long-lost elder sister.

46
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,670
Could you please tell us how you're feeling now?

47
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,510
-Yes.
-Yes.

48
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:10,990
I...

49
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,590
I have nothing to say.

50
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,390
The interview today

51
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,510
is over now.

52
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,280
Excuse me.

53
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:17,870
Excuse me.

54
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,350
Miss Bai!

55
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:18,800
Excuse me.

56
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,250
Miss Bai! Miss Bai!

57
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,440
Who allowed you to come here and see me without permission?

58
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,490
Zhan Jinjie has escaped.

59
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,500
He has escaped?

60
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,829
When did this happen?

61
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:34,670
Well...

62
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,210
It happened this morning.

63
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:37,900
I don't know how it happened, either.

64
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,040
I asked you to keep an eye on someone,

65
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,550
but you couldn't even do that.

66
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,020
What else can you do?

67
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,829
A loser like you

68
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:43,790
even wants to replace Jiang Muyi

69
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,910
and become the heir of the Jiang Family?

70
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,370
Don't even dream about it.

71
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:48,670
Yes.

72
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,920
Am I talking to a piece of wood right now?

73
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,200
How's that matter going?

74
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,040
Just hurry up.

75
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:04,930
Minmin.

76
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:05,480
Don't...

77
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,890
Don't worry.

78
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,000
I've got everything ready.

79
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,770
Minmin.

80
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,960
[Ms. Jiang, big news! Zhan Jinjie is missing. The relationship between Jin Minmin and Jiang Sensen is very strange.]

81
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:32,159
[What's more, it seems that they're discussing a plot against you. You have to be careful.]

82
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,860
Zhan Jinjie is missing.

83
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,450
Read the text message Bai Long has sent me.

84
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,350
How come you have no reaction?

85
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,520
Come with me to search for him.

86
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,340
Calm down.

87
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:02,990
Listen to me first.

88
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:03,550
What do you want to say?

89
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,540
He's already missing.

90
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,200
I have news about Zhan Jinjie.

91
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,370
About that car accident,

92
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,150
it's very likely

93
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,430
Jiang Muyi will have new memories resurging.

94
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,630
She might remember everything one day.

95
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,030
Why don't you go tell her?

96
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,630
You're the one who did it all.

97
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,290
Do you think you can get away with it?

98
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,470
-We've long been in the same boat.
-Jiang Sensen.

99
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,290
That's impossible.

100
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,130
How dare you threaten me?

101
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,730
He's not that kind of person.

102
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,490
If you don't believe in this recording,

103
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,420
then how do you explain the text message

104
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,620
Bai Long has sent you?

105
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,030
[Ms. Jiang, big news! Zhan Jinjie is missing. The relationship between Jin Minmin and Jiang Sensen is very strange.]

106
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,310
[What's more, it seems that they're discussing a plot against you. You have to be careful.]

107
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,290
So what should we do now?

108
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:03,060
Zhan Jinjie is just a pawn.

109
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,320
As long as we can get something on him,

110
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,380
then we can manipulate him as we like.

111
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,750
But your brother is different.

112
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,040
He has the Jiang Family behind him.

113
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,040
If anything wrong happens to him...

114
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,040
you'll definitely be implicated.

115
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,010
Then what should I do?

116
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:26,610
As for this matter,

117
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,270
if we're not absolutely sure,

118
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,730
we can't have a showdown with them.

119
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,430
However, there is one person

120
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,360
whom we can try approaching first.

121
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,670
Long time no see.

122
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:49,820
Long time no see.

123
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,400
Forgive me if I didn't take good care of you.

124
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,800
Forgive me if I didn't take good care of you.

125
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:55,750
Minmin.

126
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,810
Congratulations.

127
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,010
How are things going between you and your sister lately?

128
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,090
To be honest,

129
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,070
my sister

130
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,830
is on such good terms with me now.

131
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,280
She's very clingy to me.

132
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:09,980
That's really great.

133
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,020
Ms. Jiang.

134
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:14,430
Excuse me.

135
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,070
I need to step away for a moment.

136
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:15,730
Just go.

137
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,380
Ms. Jiang,

138
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,550
you're late.

139
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,210
You'll have to be punished later

140
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,340
by drinking a few more glasses of wine.

141
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,320
Where's my Bai Long?

142
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,590
You mean

143
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:30,690
Jin Long?

144
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,280
What's wrong?

145
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,700
Since you were her former good friend,

146
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,630
hasn't anyone told you about this?

147
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,770
I suppose not.

148
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,920
That's because I quite care about

149
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,520
my younger sister, isn't it?

150
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,680
I've

151
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,640
given my long-lost sister

152
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:45,510
a top-tier

153
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,500
hillside villa.

154
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:48,680
At this time,

155
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,270
I think she's probably

156
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:51,690
having a party with her friends

157
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:52,560
in the villa.

158
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,100
It's quite normal that she doesn't have time to

159
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,230
socialize with you.

160
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,470
Ms. Jin, thank you so much

161
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:59,790
for being so generous.

162
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:00,990
Then I don't need to worry about

163
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,850
Bai Long's new life here anymore.

164
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,780
You're worried?

165
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,790
What is there to worry about?

166
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,340
I understand.

167
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,180
Our Jin Family is rich and prominent

168
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,180
and has many friends.

169
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,750
Compared with the Jiang Family,

170
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,410
it is indeed more difficult to maintain the relationship with us.

171
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,380
Yes.

172
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,720
The Jin Family is rich and prominent.

173
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,490
Most of your friends are just for dining and having fun together.

174
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:28,950
You need to go out and socialize every day

175
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,880
to maintain these relationships.

176
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,919
When Bai Long is with me,

177
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,490
she only needs to be herself.

178
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:35,539
As for other matters,

179
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:37,260
I will arrange them in advance.

180
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,100
I will never let her

181
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,230
suffer even the slightest grievance.

182
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,400
When Jin Long is with me,

183
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:43,659
she has sufficient food and clothes,

184
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:44,780
and there are companions whom she can have fun with.

185
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,840
Compared with being your assistant,

186
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,860
I think it's just much happier.

187
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,270
When will Bai Long come back?

188
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:04,330
Kids love to play.

189
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:07,670
If you really want to see her,

190
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,590
then just wait here.

191
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,160
Anyway,

192
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,830
our Jin Family can easily accommodate two more people like you.

193
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:17,230
We have plenty of rooms.

194
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,110
Alright.

195
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:24,930
Ms. Jiang.

196
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,040
Let's have a drink together.

197
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,590
They must be here to find Bai Long.

198
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,210
We need to keep an eye on them.

199
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,370
Get ready.

200
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,320
I'm ready.
