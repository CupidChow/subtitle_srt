00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,550
Now,

4
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,940
as I touch your shoulder,

5
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:54,759
you will

6
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,860
forget your name.

7
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:00,590
Okay.

8
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,240
Tell me,

9
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,070
what's your name?

10
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:10,750
Good.

11
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,630
In your subconscious mind,

12
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,950

13
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,840
open your eyes.

14
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,680
Now, you're sitting in

15
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,870
the driver's seat of a black car.

16
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,850
Do you see it?

17
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,990
Tell me,

18
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,370

19
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,579
Blood.

20
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,310
A lot of blood.

female,

47
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,050
having caused death due to drunk driving,

00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,250
was sentenced to three years in prison.

49
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,680
Due to good behavior during imprisonment,

50
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,090
the sentence was reduced by one year.

51
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,570
