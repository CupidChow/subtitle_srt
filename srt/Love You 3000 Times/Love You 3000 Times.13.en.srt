[Episode 13]

3
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:41,759
Bai Long,

4
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:43,950
I remember you once

5
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:45,150
brought me a

6
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,880
fragrance from your hometown.

7
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,630
These days, I've smelled the same scent

8
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:49,990
on Ms. Jin.

9
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,860
What a coincidence.

10
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,350
Is she beautiful?

11
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,360
Take a look.

12
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,320
What's wrong, Bai Long?

13
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,750
Is it the woman with the mole

14
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,920
on her neck?

15
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,880
Yes.

16
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,780
Could she be your sister?

17
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,820
Alright,

18
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,630
I got it.

19
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,030
Don't get excited.

20
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,470
A single photo can't prove that

21
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,790
she's your sister.

22
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,810
If it's true,

23
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,020
let's investigate.

24
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,550
Investigate.

25
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,079
We must investigate.

26
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,470
If it's her,

27
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,630
I'll go find her.

28
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:39,510
Sit down.

29
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,270
Let's have a drink

30
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,810
to celebrate that we got the first place.

31
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,630
Cheers!

32
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:20,829
Shen Xingchen,

33
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,750
it's you, right?

34
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:30,490
♫You used to say 'I love you' several times a day♫

35
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:34,140
♫You used to hold my hand so tightly♫

36
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:38,130
♫You wanted to live with me under the same roof♫

37
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,190
♫Just so you could see me the moment you woke up♫

38
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,470
What are you talking about?

39
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:46,140
♫Remember when love was as intense as fireworks♫

40
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,930
I don't understand.

41
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:50,410
♫Remember when your smile seemed to promise forever♫

42
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:53,270
♫We spoke of forever so many times♫

43
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,480
Pour me another drink.

44
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:59,880
♫Why have they all become yesterday's memories?♫

45
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:04,160
♫Whose stubbornness is hidden as we turn away?♫

46
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:08,310
♫Face to face, why do we hesitate with our words?♫

47
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,990
♫Your tears are thorns in a fairy tale world♫

48
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:16,310
♫Silently shattering my fortress♫

49
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:19,860
♫I still wish to hold your hand and go to the beach, even just once♫

50
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:18,769
Shen Xingchen.

51
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,550
Only you have this habit.

52
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,860
♫In the photo, you're still wearing that ring♫

53
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,160
Stop pretending!

54
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,210
♫Let the silence and lies gradually fade away♫

55
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,350
This habit is something I learned

56
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,590
from a teacher of mine a long time ago.

57
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:35,220
♫Only the wind of memories remains; love is not limited to this♫

58
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,750
As for Shen Xingchen you mentioned,

59
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,510
I don't know him at all.

60
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,040
Didn't everyone say

61
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,300
he's no longer around?

62
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,120
Why do you keep insisting that I'm him?

63
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,490
Could it be that you chose me back then

64
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,050
♫Remember when love was as intense as fireworks♫

65
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,330
because you couldn't forget him?

66
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,320
♫Remember when your smile seemed to promise forever♫

67
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:56,180
♫We spoke of forever so many times♫

68
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:02,790
♫Why have they all become yesterday's memories?♫

69
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,070
♫Whose stubbornness is hidden as we turn away?♫

70
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:11,220
♫Face to face, why do we hesitate with our words?♫?

71
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,210
I admit I've been keeping something from you,

72
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,270
but I never intended to

73
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:11,910
hurt you.

74
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:15,900
♫Your tears are thorns in a fairy tale world♫

75
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,030
So keeping things from me doesn't count as hurting me,

76
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:13,590
right?

77
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,220
♫Silently shattering my fortress♫

78
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,770
♫I still wish to hold your hand and go to the beach, even just once♫

79
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:26,770
♫In the photo, you're still wearing that ring♫

80
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:31,120
♫Let the silence and lies gradually fade away♫

81
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:38,130
♫Only the wind of memories remains; love is not limited to this♫

82
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:36,430
Fine.

83
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,640
You love drinking, don't you?

84
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:41,750
Since you love drinking so much,

85
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,820
go ahead and drink all you want.

86
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,950
Finish this entire bottle,

87
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,880
and I won't ask who you are anymore.

88
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,290
♫Remember when love was as intense as fireworks♫

89
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:51,790
Didn't your sister's boyfriend

90
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:52,990
already die?

91
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,550
♫Remember when your smile seemed to promise forever♫

92
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,610
How can I see him here?

93
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,350
I...

94
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,420
♫We spoke of forever so many times♫

95
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,280
Give me some time,

96
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:06,020
♫Why have they all become yesterday's memories?♫

97
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,040
and I'll tell you everything.

98
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,390
Enough.

99
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:10,310
♫Whose stubbornness is hidden as we turn away?♫

100
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,310
I said enough!

101
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:14,450
♫Face to face, why do we hesitate with our words?♫

102
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:19,140
♫Your tears are thorns in a fairy tale world♫

103
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,400
Go.

104
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,450
♫Silently shattering my fortress♫

105
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,530
I won't ask who you are anymore.

106
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,280
Our contract is terminated.

107
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:26,000
♫I still wish to hold your hand and go to the beach, even just once♫

108
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,840
I don't want to dwell on this anymore.

109
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:30,000

112
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,070
Shen Xingchen.

113
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,000
Is that you?

114
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,950
What are you keeping from me?

115
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,880
Why is fate treating me like this?

116
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,630
You clearly came back.

117
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,430
You came back to my side,

118
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,210
but why do I feel like

119
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,870
you're so far away from me?
