[Episode 11]

3
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,070
Ms. Jiang.

4
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:36,870
Ms. Jiang.

5
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,390
Who exactly are you?

6
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,950
No matter how many times you ask, I'm He Yuchuan.

7
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:47,789
I've already known the truth.

8
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:48,990
Just be honest.

9
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,720
Do you think I'm a child?

10
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,390
How do you know about my affairs?

11
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:53,620
Because I have your confession

12
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,030
of the murder.

13
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,750
What does this have to do with you?

14
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,590
You are my fiancée.

15
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:05,630
I want to help you.

16
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,360
I advise you to stay out of this.

17
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:08,960
I know you're innocent

18
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,030
in this matter.

19
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,510
Why should I trust you?

20
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,370
Because you don't have any other choice.

21
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,150
When tasting wine,

22
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,630
you need to engage

23
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:40,870
your senses of touch,

24
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,110
hearing,

25
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:43,350
sight,

26
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,200
and taste.

27
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:48,650
First,

28
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,220
pour the wine

29
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,490
into a goblet,

30
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,810
holding the stem

31
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,380
or supporting the base.

32
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,040
Leaning it against a piece of paper,

33
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,620
tilt it at a 45-degree angle

34
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,470
and observe the wine's color carefully

35
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,150
in natural light.

36
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:03,910
Honey, look at

37
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,860
the color of this wine;

38
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,760
it's clear

39
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:07,690
and radiant.

40
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:09,700
The lighter

41
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,750
the color,

42
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,570
the more vintage the wine;

43
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,370
the deeper the color,

44
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,620
the fresher it is.

45
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,640
Congratulations, He Yuchuan!

46
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,510
You've completed this round with full marks

47
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,510
and are currently in first place.

48
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,180
What?

49
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,600
I can't believe I'm not in first place.

50
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,750
Well, honey.

51
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,950
I...

52
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,190
I was careless just now.

53
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:30,870
Don't worry.

54
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,600
I can make it.

55
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,110
It's okay.

56
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,829
No need to rush.

57
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:55,110
Drink slowly.

58
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,240
I can make it.

59
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,450
Honey, are you alright?

60
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,830
What should I do?

61
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,300
What should I do?

62
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,460
I need to test Jin Minmin.

63
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:53,950
What are you up to?

64
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,390
I want to help you.

65
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,909
You've already got first place.

66
00:04:58,909 --> 00:05:00,280
Stop pretending here.

67
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,110
Do you really think I'm a fool?

68
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,030
Besides,

69
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,990
how do I know if you're trying to help me

70
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,080
or harm me?

71
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,530
I don't even want to be in first place,

72
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,070
but I know

73
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:11,760
you do.

74
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,280
If you can perform well

75
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,550
in this round,

76
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,340
maybe first place

77
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:18,630
will be yours.

78
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,120
Well, tell me,

79
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,450
how can you help me?

80
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,250
Take me to see Ms. Jin later.

81
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,250
You can just say I'm your friend to offer a toast.

82
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:34,990
Then I'll help you

83
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,250
position the glasses.

84
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,400
At that time,

85
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,770
if you perform well,

86
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,250
she'll definitely

87
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,130
be impressed with you.

88
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,920
Minmin.

89
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:57,200
Yuchuan

90
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,310
is a new friend

91
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,630
I met at the training camp.

92
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,470
I brought him along to have a drink.

93
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,430
Hello, Ms. Jin.

94
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,510
I heard on the broadcast that

95
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,830
you're currently in first place.

96
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,670
Very good.

97
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,040
You seem to have

98
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,090
quite a bit of knowledge about wine tasting.

99
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,470
Thanks for the ego boost.

100
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,270
It's just a little hobby of mine.

101
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,100
Here,

102
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,530
let me toast to you.

103
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:22,680
Ms. Jin,

104
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,860
haven't we

105
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,240
met somewhere before?

106
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,180
How could that be?

107
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:42,770
This is...

108
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:45,390
This is a Romanée-Conti

109
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,470
from the Burgundy region

110
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:47,570
of France.

111
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:48,720
It has flavors of

112
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,470
cinnamon,

113
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,280
licorice,

114
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,210
blackberry,

115
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,600
and redberry.

116
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,110
Come on.

117
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,340
Taste this one.

118
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,470
Since you know so much about red wine,

119
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,000
why don't you sit down and have a drink with me?

120
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:01,390
Here.

121
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:01,970
Sit down.

122
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,200
Go get some more wine.

123
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,240
I want to have a good chat

124
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,480
with your friend here.

125
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,040
Go.

126
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,730
Here.

127
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:23,910
Ms. Jin,

128
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,470
let me propose a toast to you.

129
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,710
He Yuchuan, you liar!

130
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:34,520
You said you'd help me win first place in this round,

131
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,520
but in the end, you're the one stealing the spotlight.

132
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,350
Let me see how you'll show off next.

133
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,010
Ms. Jiang,

134
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,290
He Yuchuan...

135
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,409
Tell me.

136
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,810
How about you come with me and check it out?

137
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,850
How long have you known Ms. Jiang?

138
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,140
And now you're already getting married?

139
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,070
Ms. Jiang,

140
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,110
your fiancé is

141
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,510
really well-traveled and knowledgeable.

142
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,220
With herr cold personality,

143
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,380
you must have

144
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,070
suffered quite a bit with her.

145
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,510
You should be more attentive to him.

146
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,270
Ms. Jin,

147
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,740
whether my man is good or not,

148
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,600
I know very well myself.

149
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:33,919
I advise you

150
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,650
to keep an eye on your man first.

151
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:46,930
Excuse us, Ms. Jin.

152
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,820
How can they be so alike?

153
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,910
Jin Minmin,

154
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,130
you should care more about me.

155
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,510
I can't even get the prize money anymore.

156
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,130
Anyone who wants to compete

157
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,140
can compete.

158
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,990
I don't want to compete anymore.

159
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:06,950
Whatever.

160
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:15,840
Honey, are you alright?

161
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,270
Come on.

162
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:16,780
Excuse me, please.

163
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,490
Thank you.

164
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,730
What kind of lousy competition is this?

165
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,510
We're never participating in this again.

166
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,440
Let's withdraw!

167
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,390
Let's withdraw!
