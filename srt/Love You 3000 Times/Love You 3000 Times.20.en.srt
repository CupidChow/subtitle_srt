[Episode 20]

3
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,759
Minmin.

4
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,420
He Yuchuan, let go!

5
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,630
Mr. Jiang.

6
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,140
Do you need something?

7
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:47,060
Ms. Jin, I'll leave you to it then.

8
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,060
I'll be going now.

9
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,960
Minmin…

10
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,920
How many times has this happened recently?

11
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,150
You didn't give me a heads up beforehand

12
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,230
and just came to see me directly.

13
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,070
Did you take

14
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,530
what I said to heart or not?

15
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,840
Minmin.

16
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:08,210
Don't be mad.

17
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:11,330
Getting angry is not good

18
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,690
for your skin, is it?

19
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,200
Right?

20
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,520
Don't give me that.

21
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,690
You must have done it on purpose.

22
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,230
That's not true.

23
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:19,900
I…

24
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,150
How's the situation with Bai Long?

25
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:24,500
Still locked up.

26
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,930
The female lead's assistant is so stupid.

27
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,280
There's no hillside villa at all.

28
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,110
It's all made up by Ms. Jin.

29
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,870
I'll say!

30
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,360
Ms. Jin

31
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,860
is really clever.

32
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,150
Who could have thought

33
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,040
that Bai Long is locked up

34
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,820
in the basement of our Jin family's house?

35
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,470
Even if Jiang Muyi

36
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,750
searches high and low,

37
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,550
she won't be able to find her.

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,310
Hey, beautiful.

39
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:09,510
Can I

40
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,630
get to know you?

41
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,250
You keep testing Jin Minmin.

42
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,850
I'll have Jiang Sensen take me to find Bai Long.

43
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,600
We'll split up in a moment.

44
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,630
In my trunk,

45
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,470
there's a bag Bai Long uses for self-defense.

46
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,730
Take it with you later.

47
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:27,940
Is that really necessary?

48
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,510
Just take it when I tell you to.

49
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,840
Better safe than sorry.

50
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,040
Getting angry is not good

51
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,560
for your skin, is it?

52
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,430
Right?

53
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,310
Don't give me that.

54
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,520
You must have done it on purpose.

55
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,270
That's not true.

56
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:44,740
I…

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,930
How's the situation with Bai Long?

58
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,220
Still locked up.

59
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,740
This isn't right, what we're doing.

60
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,269
Jiang Sensen.

61
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,670
I'm warning you.

62
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,770
You already let Zhan Jinjie escape last time.

63
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,450
If anyone escapes again this time,

64
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:25,910
you can get the out of here!

65
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,200
Um...

66
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,010
My friend is coming to pick up the car soon.

67
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:00,670
I...

68
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,560
I can't give you a ride.

69
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:04,800
That's perfect.

70
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,840
Drive my car.

71
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,470
I need to deliver something to Bai Long anyway.

72
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,110
Is it really this hot in the car?

73
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,260
What's wrong?

74
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,170
Nothing.

75
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:05,790
It's probably because I didn't sleep well last night.

76
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,490
Sensen,

77
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,820
what are you afraid of?

78
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:12,780
I...

79
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,400
Have you forgotten all the grievances

80
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,380
you've endured over the years?

81
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,600
Those two have come looking for us.

82
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,530
They clearly have ill intentions.

83
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,020
We have no choice but to strike first.

84
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,620
We can't afford to be soft-hearted.

85
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,200
Do I really

86
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,920
have to harm my sister?

87
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:13,640
He Yuchuan.

88
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,950
There's no one at home now.

89
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,850
Shall we

90
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,550
speed things up?

91
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,420
Ms. Jin,

92
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:27,870
let's not rush.

93
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,120
What do you mean?

94
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,630
Are you playing

95
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,360
hard to get with me here?

96
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:41,750
Ms. Jin,

97
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,659
why don't we

98
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,740
have some tea

99
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,820
and chat first?

100
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,960
Could it be that…

101
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,540
you have some problems?

102
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,880
Of course I don't have any problems.

103
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,420
I'm a very healthy

104
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:07,780
adult male.

105
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,830
Then...

106
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,350
Ms. Jin,

107
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:15,330
I actually think we have quite a connection.

108
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,080
If it weren't for Jiang Muyi,

109
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,950
I wouldn't have had the chance to meet

110
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:18,990
someone like you,

111
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,320
a remarkable woman.

112
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:29,490
I've known Jiang Muyi for a long time,

113
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,480
it's just that

114
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:34,500
she didn't know me.
