The scars on my back

were caused by her.

14
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,390
She has been bullying me

ever since I was little.

16

took away our parents' love from her,

18
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,190

I couldn't stand the way she looked at me anymore,

28
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,110

not to go back to that home

30
