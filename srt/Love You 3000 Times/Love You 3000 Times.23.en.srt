[Episode 23]

3
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,570
Jiang Sensen!

4
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,680
Stay back!

5
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,160
If you come any closer, I'll die together with her.

6
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,039
Calm down.

7
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,280
We won't come closer.

8
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:42,190
Sensen.

9
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:43,110
Come here.

10
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,770
It's dangerous over there.

11
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,280
Minmin.

12
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:47,660
I have no other choice.

13
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,840
I have to die with her;

14
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,160
it's the only way to spare you from pain.

15
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,820
Jiang Sensen.

16
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:53,750
I'm warning you;

17
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:54,640
don't do anything rash.

18
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,080
No.

19
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:57,520
Minmin.

20
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,430
I actually haven't been honest with you all along.

21
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,040
Yes,

22
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,240
I do hate my sister,

23
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,260
but

24
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,990
I never had the courage to kill her.

25
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:08,970
But

26
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:09,930
for you,

27
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,590
I do!

28
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:12,820
Jiang Sensen.

29
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,180
I never truly

30
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,730
wanted her to die.

31
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,450
Sensen,

32
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:23,510
if you have something to say,

33
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,150
can we come closer and talk?

34
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,030
Come here.

35
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,110
Yes,

36
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,740
I admit I have many flaws.

37
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,390
I've never been able to do the things

38
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,750
you arranged for me properly.

39
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,680
I'm stupid!

40
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,300
But even so,

41
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,600
I want to try my best

42
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,260
to give you a bright future.

43
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,500
Because, Jin Minmin,

44
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,750
I love you.

45
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,600
I love you!

46
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,470
I've been lying to myself.

47
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,110
I'm the coward

48
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,190
who's afraid to face reality.

49
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,700
Jiang Sensen, you're right.

50
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,790
I want happiness,

51
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,470
but that doesn't mean I need her to disappear

52
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,160
for me to find it!

53
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:18,670
All these years,

54
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,470
no matter what I did,

55
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,130
you've always been by my side.

56
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,430
Jiang Sensen,

57
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,010
if you jump from here now,

58
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,930
there will never be anyone left in this world

59
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,180
to stay by my side,

60
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,110
no one who will

61
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,220
unconditionally trust me,

62
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,970
no one who will love me.

63
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,370
I've made up my mind.

64
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,780
Let's turn ourselves in.

65
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,710
We

66
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,980
will surely have a future.

67
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,420
Come here,

68
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,070
okay?

69
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:09,480
Minmin.

70
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:12,810
Minmin!

71
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,110
Xingchen!

72
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,590
Xingchen!

73
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,710
Dr. Zhan,

74
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,450
it's been three years since the car accident,

75
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,050
and he's still in this state.

76
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,520
Is there no other way?

77
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,070
His body has gradually recovered,

78
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,550
but he hasn't woken up yet.

79
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,320
He seems to be suffering from

80
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,230
PTSD.

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,750
Over the past six months,

82
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,550
we've been using hypnotherapy,

83
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,550
trying to

84
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,810
implant new memories

85
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,430
to break through his psychological defenses

86
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,000
and stimulate him to wake up.

87
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,960
Muyi,

88
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,000
you know him best.

89
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,810
I need your help.

90
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,600
On the day of the accident,

91
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,820
he proposed to me,

92
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,770
but I didn't accept.

93
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,840
Because I am Jiang Muyi of the Jiang Group,

94
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:00,150
I don't even belong to myself.

95
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:02,170
My work,

96
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,040
my parents,

97
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,820
and my younger brother, who just returned from abroad,

98
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,950
all rely on me to take responsibility.

99
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,500
There are so many shackles holding me back.

100
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:15,370
After I refused him,

101
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,320
he searched for me all over the city,

102
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:21,230
and that's when the accident happened.

103
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,270
He yearned for freedom.

104
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,190
The time I spent with him

105
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,320
was the happiest few years

106
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,510
of my life.

107
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,909
Being with me

108
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:36,310
clearly put such great pressure on him too,

109
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,000
yet he still chose me.

110
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,670
But at that time,

111
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,070
I didn't want him

112
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,320
to live a life bound like mine.

113
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,010
I lacked confidence in our relationship,

114
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,480
which hurt him

115
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,280
and ultimately led to the accident.

116
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,900
You know,

117
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,440
I've never regretted

118
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,840
any decisions I've made,

119
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,890
but this time I was wrong.

120
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,980
I thought rejecting him was for his own good,

121
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,240
but I actually hurt him.

122
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,580
If I had another chance,

123
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,630
I would definitely say yes to him.

124
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:27,890
Muyi,

125
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,490
we've known each other for a long time too.

126
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,000
You've always been

127
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,630
a role model in others' eyes.

128
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,310
Haven't you ever thought about

129
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,950
being yourself for once?

130
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,060
Dr. Zhan,

131
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,010
I'm willing to do whatever you ask,

132
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,250
as long as you can make him wake up.

133
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,070
Even if he hates you,

134
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,010
are you still willing?

135
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,770
As long as he can wake up,

136
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,730
even if he hates me

137
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,190
or forgets me,

138
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,320
I'm willing to accept it.

139
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,820
Since last month,

140
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,350
I have been using the entire memory

141
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,680
to maximize the stimulation of his brain.

142
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,810
According to the report,

143
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,830
Shen Xingchen's brain waves

144
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,230
have shown a response

145
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,260
since last month,

146
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:16,230
indicating that our consciousness implantation has been successful.

147
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,070
He sees you

148
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,840
as the murderer who killed him.
