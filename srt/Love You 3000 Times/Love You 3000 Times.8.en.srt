[Episode 8]

3
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,780
If it were you,

4
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:49,130
you'd definitely remember this outfit, wouldn't you?

5
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,440
He looks so depressed.

6
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,110
Ms. Jiang,

7
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,790
your fiancé seems to have something on his mind.

8
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,300
Ms. Jiang is so outstanding,

9
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,030
but her fiancé

10
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,630
is quite ordinary.

11
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,350
Ms. Jiang doesn't like jokes.

12
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,350
The next person coming on stage is

13
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,250
the husband of our No. 1 guest, Tian Zhennan,

14
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,950
Yuan Bin!

15
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,070
Hello, everyone.

16
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,300
I'm Yuan Bin, who has been married for two and a half years.

17
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,200
The pink suit I'm wearing today

18
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,780
is meant to convey the theme that

19
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,550
even a tough man

20
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,590
has a soft side.

21
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,490
Regarding men choosing to be househusbands,

22
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,130
many people

23
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,870
-have different opinions.
- Ms. Tian.

24
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,910
He's doing this again.

25
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,290
This doesn't conform to traditional views,

26
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,150
and there is a lack of masculinity.

27
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,750
You don't understand.

28
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,510
Young people

29
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,180
just like to stick to the end.

30
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,030
And I think that

31
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,560
there must be a family-oriented man

32
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,920
behind every excellent woman.

33
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,390
It's just that the outfit he chose this time isn't quite good.

34
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,570
Its color is the same as mine.

35
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:03,950
No way.

36
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,130
He and I are in matching outfits.

37
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,810
Please support me, everyone.

38
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,040
Thank you.

I

53
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,550
am your youth.

54

Many people's first love

55
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,030
tends to happen on campus.

56
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:41,850
First love on campus

57
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,790
is youthful and beautiful.

58
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,040
Although we

59
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,640
didn't meet on campus,

60
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,480
I hope to

61
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,320
use my handsome looks

62
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,730
and youthful energy

63
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,670

Zhang Xueyang!

65
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,560
Although I'm not your first love,

66
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,590
I'm willing

67
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,430
to make you

68
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,040
have the feeling of first love forever!

69
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,690
Is she okay?

70
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,980
She's love-stricken.

71
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,200
You're just envious of me

72
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,930
as I have a husband who is both handsome and manly.

73
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,500
Your husband, Zheng Hongyan, is coming.

74
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,250
Hello, everyone.

Ms. Jin.

79

Your boyfriend

80
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,270
is both greasy and handsome.

81
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,900
Your taste is quite unique.

82
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,680
Ms. Jin.

83
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,060
What kind of dance is that?

84
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,360
This is called jazz.

85
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,800
Don't you know that?

86
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:14,300
Alright.

87
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:19,040
He's still a bit nervous today.

88
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,910
When he practices it usually,

89
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,190
he dances much better than this.

90
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,870
It looks like he hasn't shown his true potential yet.

91
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,030
So what do you think?

92
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,840

purely by accident.

96
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,320
I know where you are.

97

Why are you leaving?

111
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,900
Watch it for a while longer.

112
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,780
Ms. Jiang is feeling shy.

I'm warning you.

116

Just behave yourself.

117
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,490
What do you mean by that, Ms. Jiang?

118
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,200
Was the fashion show still

119
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,960
not satisfactory to you?

120
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,230
Your every word and action

121
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,070
represent my image.

122
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:27,060
Do you think I've embarrassed you, Ms. Jiang?

[Man Training Camp]

124
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:32,000
You don't want me to display my image on stage.

125
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,000
Do you want me

126
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,350
to show it to you again privately?

127
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,670
Don't push your luck.

128
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:51,620
Ms. Jiang,

129
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,600
you started this game first.

130
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,909
So I should have a say in the rules too, shouldn't I?

131
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,260
If even this makes you feel embarrassed,

132
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,700
don't forget that

133
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,030
I have many more ways

Be careful, or you might not be able to bear the consequences.
