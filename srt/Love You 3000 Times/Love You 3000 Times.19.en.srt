before we kiss.

5
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,690
There are cameras outside.

6
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,090
And audio monitors, too.

7
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,320
Have you been able to contact Bai Long?

8
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,440
If she knew I was here,

9
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,790
she'd definitely come to see me.

10
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:21,890
If that's the case,

11
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,500
there's only one possibility.

12
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,590
It's that after Bai Long

13
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,920
sent you that message last time,

14
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,160
she was discovered.

15
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,400
What exactly does Jin Minmin want to do?

16
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,270
We can't reach Bai Long now.

17
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:39,260
We can only rely on ourselves for everything.

What are you doing?

20
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:39,650
Someone is watching us.

21
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,680
We have to…

22
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,940
do something

23
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,800
to avoid suspicion.

24
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,310
Then what

25
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,470
do you want to do?

26
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,470
Let's just…

27
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,860
put on a show.

28

Shut up.

32
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,120
Keep your eyes peeled.

33
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,450
It might be a diversion.

What's wrong?

35
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,580
What's wrong?

36
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,590
Didn't I tell you to keep an eye on the surveillance?

37
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,920
How did you fall asleep?

38
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,250
Minmin,

39
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,430
I didn't mean to.

40
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,150
I don't know how I dozed off.

41
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,570
Oh my gosh!

42
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,220
Is the surveillance camera broken?

43
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,140
Could they have found out?

Did Bai Long

00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,600
not come back all night?

50
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,200
I think so.

51
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,440
Otherwise, last night

52
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,040
she would've come to find us.

53
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,260

you're usually so busy.
