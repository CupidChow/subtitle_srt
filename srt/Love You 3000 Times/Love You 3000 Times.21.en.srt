00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,870
[Episode 21]

3
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:34,479
Ms. Jin,

4
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:35,630
I actually think we

5
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,030
have quite a connection.

6
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:39,080
If it weren't for Jiang Muyi,

7
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,050
I wouldn't have had the chance to meet

8
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,280
such an outstanding woman

9
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,410
like you.

10
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,710
I've known Jiang Muyi for a long time,

11
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,479
it's just that

12
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:56,229
she doesn't remember me.

13
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,520
We attended the same

14
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,590
elite school since childhood.

15
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,270
She was always the top student.

16
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,789
So talented from such a young age.

17
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,770
My father was always very strict with me,

18
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,900
so he constantly compared me to Jiang Muyi.

19
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,420
As long as she was around,

20
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,730
I could only be her shadow.

21
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,110
Everyone I liked preferred her.

22
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,290
For her,

23
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:35,270
repeatedly stealing my love interests

24
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,510
was so easy

25
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,780
and meaningless.

26
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,680
Ms. Jin, please don't overthink it.

27
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:42,670
Muyi

28
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,410
is just trying to live her own life.

29
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:49,040
All these years,

30
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,870
I've always seen her as my rival.

31
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,270
I swore

32
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,860
I would surpass her.

33
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,740
But she doesn't even remember me.

34
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:04,990
Why?

35
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,070
Why is she better than me in every way?

36
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,420
Even her fiancé is better than mine.

37
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,690
Ms. Jin,

38
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,240
please calm down.

39
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,230
I need to use the restroom.

40
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,740
He Yuchuan.

41
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,910
What are you doing?

42
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,240
Ms. Jin,

43
00:03:58,910 --> 00:03:59,850
how about

44
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:00,860
I

45
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,750
show you some swordsmanship

46
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,860
to liven things up?

47
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,310
Jiang Sensen.

48
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,840
Is this the way to the villa?

49
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,870
I'm talking to you.

50
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,730
I...

51
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,220
I'm feeling a bit carsick.

52
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,010
You'll go with Jiang Sensen yourself.

53
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,110
Are you sure it's okay?

54
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,110
I understand him.

55
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:03,980
I need to figure out

56
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,440
why Jiang Sensen did this.

57
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,370
Ms. Jiang, you need to be careful.

58
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:09,720
Jiang Sensen and Jin Minmin

59
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,320
are conspiring against you.

60
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,240
Bai Long?

61
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,070
Help! Someone come here!

62
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,190
Today, you've fallen into my hands.

63
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,870
You deserve this.

64
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:26,520
I originally thought

65
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,710
you had a change of heart,

66
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:28,990
but I never expected you'd use

67
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,210
the same old tricks from our childhood even now.

68
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,830
Bullying me when we were kids was one thing,

69
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,450
but you're still using me even as adults.

70
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:34,710
You must be crazy.

71
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,480
Now

72
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,340
you're even trying to harm Muyi.

73
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,740
Have some humanity!

74
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,400
What's the use of saying

75
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,500
all this now?

76
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,890
Soon,

77
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,520
you'll have to collect her body.

78
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,320
I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed.

79
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:56,500
What do you mean?

80
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,630
Dear Ms. Jin,

81
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,010
surprised?

82
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,060
I'm still alive.

83
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,940
Zhan Jinjie?

84
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,250
Zhan Jinjie?

85
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,860
Zhan Jinjie, what's wrong?

86
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,990
What happened?

87
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,460
It was done by Jin Minmin

88
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,460
and Jiang Sensen, that pair of scoundrels.

89
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,480
I gave it my all,

90
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,970
worked my ass off for them,

91
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,990
and they tried to kill me.

92
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,630
Since they're so heartless,

93
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,710
they shouldn't blame me for being disloyal.

94
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,370
I'll be honest with you.

95
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,880
The plan against Jiang Muyi

96
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,670
is about to be set in motion again.

97
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,160
If not a car accident,

98
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,280
then it'll be a jump into the sea.

99
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,530
How do you know this?

100
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:33,059
Because I was involved too.

101
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,000
No,

102
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,159
Muyi,

103
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:38,039
let me explain.

104
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:38,940
I'm sorry.

105
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:39,750
I had no choice.

106
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,020
I...

107
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:40,760
Enough.

108
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,520
After this, we're even.

109
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,780
I hope you'll walk the right path from now on.

110
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,910
Go turn yourself in.

111
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,110
In the end, it still failed.

112
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,980
Everything I've done was in vain.
