00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,910
[Episode 16]

3
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:37,140
You're Shen Xingchen, right?

4
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,870
He Yuchuan's identity is fake.

5
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,110
Why do you always compare a dead person

6
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,090
to me?

7
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,410
You'll be compared anyway.

8
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,789
Who knew whether my sister liked you

9
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:52,990
because you look like

10
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:54,310
her ex-boyfriend?

11
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:56,890
Jiang Sensen,

12
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,820
the ring at today's auction

13
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,590
was replaced by you, right?

14
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,310
Now you're here showcasing

15
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,770
your so-called evidence.

16
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,290
Your actions make me

17
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,870
even more suspicious of your motives.

18
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:09,630
You...

19
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,280
What are you saying?

20
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,520
I don't understand.

21
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,280
But I will find out who you are

22
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,340
sooner or later.

23
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,740
Jiang Muyi.

24
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:34,930
Jiang Muyi.

25
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,350
Can we talk?

26
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,650
What's there to talk about?

27
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,030
Since you don't want to say anything,

28
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,990
I won't ask.

29
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,990
I have something to show you.

30
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,000
Where did you get these things?

31
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,670
Your brother just gave them to me.

32
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,470
Jiang Sensen?

33
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:14,900
Right.

34
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,440
Have you thought about

35
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,370
why these photos

36
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,680
ended up in his hands?

37
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,120
What exactly are you trying to say?

38
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,030
Don't you think

39
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,670
these photos

40
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,590
are too clear?

41
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,140
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,930
I'm sorry, Shen Xingchen.

43
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:47,790
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,040
I'm sorry, Shen Xingchen.

45
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,890
I'm sorry, Shen Xingchen.

46
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:51,930
-I got you killed.
-No. No.

47
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:52,870
It's my fault. I got you killed.

48
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,790
No, no.

49
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,950
It's not your fault.

50
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,220
Muyi,

51
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,410
I believe you.

52
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,060
I believe you.

53
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,060
It definitely wasn't you who did it.

54
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,750
I can't even believe myself.

55
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:08,990
Muyi,

56
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,270
think carefully.

57
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:14,950
The day...

58
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,750
The day when the car accident happened,

59
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:20,550
you didn't drink at all.

60
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,480
Right?

61
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,340
Don't come any closer.

62
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:43,590
Muyi.

63
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,750
Don't come closer!

64
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:45,150
Muyi.

65
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,390
-Don't come over!
-Muyi.

66
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:46,990
Don't come over!

67
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,150
-Muyi.
-Don't come over!

68
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:48,510
Muyi!

69
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,690
Dr. Zhan has confirmed with me many times.

70
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:51,510
These images have been stuck

71
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,870
in my mind for years.

72
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,390
You don't need to make excuses for me.

73
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,750
I hurt Shen Xingchen.

74
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,909
I hit him.

75
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,430
It was me who hit him.

76
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,750
-No, Muyi, that's not true.
-Even if he didn't die...

77
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,350
-It's not like that.
-I also killed him.

78
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,660
You didn't kill him.

79
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,130
I'm not dead, Muyi.

80
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:12,830
I'm not dead.

81
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,480
You mustn't blame yourself, okay?

82
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,190
I'm fine.

83
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:21,910
Muyi,

84
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,910
I hope you can calm down

85
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,900
and listen to me.

86
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,240
What...

87
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,500
What I'm about to say is likely something

88
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,470
you won't believe.

89
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:40,500
I...

90
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,980
I feel like I'm in someone else's body.

91
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,780
To be precise,

92
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:48,670
this body

93
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,430
is my twin brother's.

94
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,470
But my memories are still here.

95
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,560
I remember everything

96
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,700
about you.

97
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,870
Do you remember

98
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,120
the first time I cooked noodles for you,

99
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,240
I put a lot of salt in it?

100
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,000
Because I was afraid you would forget me.

101
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,290
But you said you would never forget me.

102
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,690
Shen Xingchen,

103
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,190
is it you?

104
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,750
Is it you?

105
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,750
You've come back.

106
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:30,730
I've come back.

107
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,920
You've come back.

108
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:32,880
I've come back.

109
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:33,790
You've come back.

110
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:34,650
I've come back.

111
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,310
Why did you come back so late?

112
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,860
It was my fault.

113
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,090
I've come back.

114
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,670
I've come back.

115
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,970
Muyi,

116
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,720
I've come back.

117
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,190
Stop crying.

118
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,000
Muyi,

119
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,810
I want to ask you,

120
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,380
you just said you were able to

121
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,540
recall memories

122
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,680
through Dr. Zhan's...

123
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,300
You recalled your memories

124
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,659
through Dr. Zhan's

125
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,390
hypnosis, right?

126
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,640
Now you're sitting

127
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,010
in the driver's seat of a black car.

128
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,490
Do you see it?

129
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:01,470
Good.

130
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,520
Now tell me,

131
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,200
what do you see?

132
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:07,740
Blood.

133
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,680
Shen Xingchen.

134
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,860
A lot of blood.

135
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,220
Excellent, excellent.

136
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,450
Shen Xingchen is right in front of you.

137
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,100
Tell me,

138
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:21,110
what did you do to him?

139
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:22,790
I…

140
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,430
I hit...

141
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,150
Very good.

142
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:24,790
I hit him.

143
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:25,490
Very good.

144
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,810
Remember this detail.

145
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,520
You rushed to find me,

146
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,049
what's the matter?

147
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,150
I have cash flow issues.

148
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,970
Give me three million yuan.

149
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,110
How much?

150
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:48,910
Three million yuan?

151
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,310
Are you crazy?

152
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,560
Three million yuan

153
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,490
for a piece of information.

154
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,740
Zhan Jinjie.

155
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,240
Don't go too far.

156
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,410
Jiang Muyi

157
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,700
might recall something new

158
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,880
about the car accident.
