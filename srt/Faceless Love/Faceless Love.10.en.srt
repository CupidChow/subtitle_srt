00:00:00,452 --> 00:00:02,824
You're the only woman in the whole world

2
00:00:02,841 --> 00:00:05,381
who could make me feel so stupid!

3
00:00:06,067 --> 00:00:07,092
Get out!

4
00:00:07,856 --> 00:00:09,696
Someone is here to see you.

5
00:00:11,783 --> 00:00:13,104
Are you here to see your mother?

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,310
Who is she?

7
00:00:16,981 --> 00:00:19,501
Neeraaumpan has Alzheimer's.

8
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:26,407
Is there any way that might help bring her memory back faster?

9
00:00:26,823 --> 00:00:29,658
You can try telling her about the past.

10
00:00:30,907 --> 00:00:35,807
Music, films, and food could be helpful.

11
00:00:36,195 --> 00:00:38,409
I need you to teach me how to make hot chocolate.

12
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:40,180
Right now.

13
00:00:42,044 --> 00:00:43,070
Of course.

THE FAMILIAR EMBRACE

21
00:02:31,826 --> 00:02:34,504
You can put your stuff here.

22
00:02:40,295 --> 00:02:43,700
The ingredients that we need are

23
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,709
vanilla ice cream,

24
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,461
chocolate bar,

25
00:02:50,746 --> 00:02:51,349
milk,

26
00:02:51,356 --> 00:02:53,458
and marshmallow.

27
00:02:57,086 --> 00:02:58,704
Salt, we don't need it.

28
00:03:01,115 --> 00:03:02,306
Baking powder.

29
00:03:02,367 --> 00:03:03,581
We don't need it.

30
00:03:04,847 --> 00:03:05,980
Lime?

31
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,903
We also don't need it.

32
00:03:11,503 --> 00:03:12,509
MSG?

33
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,012
Are you sure that we are making hot chocolate?

34
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:20,704
I just bought things that I thought would be useful.

35
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,663
MSG can make anything taste better, right?

36
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:27,826
Okay.

37
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:32,410
Milk.

38
00:03:32,904 --> 00:03:34,260
You didn't buy milk, did you?

39
00:03:36,647 --> 00:03:37,616
It's okay.

40
00:03:37,852 --> 00:03:39,063
I have milk in my fridge.

41
00:03:47,604 --> 00:03:48,664
So...

42
00:03:48,678 --> 00:03:50,907
let's turn on the stove.

43
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:55,304
Put six pips of chocolate bar in.

44
00:04:02,787 --> 00:04:04,736
Keep stirring until the chocolate is melted.

45
00:04:12,326 --> 00:04:13,327
After the chocolate has melted,

46
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:16,740
add two tablespoons of ice cream.

47
00:04:20,258 --> 00:04:21,112
Here.

48
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,509
Two tablespoons.

49
00:04:24,978 --> 00:04:26,503
Which one is a tablespoon?

50
00:04:27,256 --> 00:04:29,341
Does every tablespoon have the same size?

51
00:04:30,969 --> 00:04:33,550
Yes, they all have the same size.

52
00:04:34,581 --> 00:04:37,204
Don't the spoons in your house look like this?

53
00:04:38,116 --> 00:04:39,204
No.

54
00:04:39,593 --> 00:04:42,540
I have different spoons for dinner, soup, and tea.

55
00:04:44,904 --> 00:04:46,450
Tablespoons are dinner spoons.

56
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,349
Dinner spoon.

57
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:55,100
This is what I call a dinner spoon.

58
00:04:56,852 --> 00:04:58,218
The amount is fine.

59
00:05:48,878 --> 00:05:52,818
Do you think what will happen between those two?

60
00:05:54,149 --> 00:05:56,978
Whatever it is, I just hope it ends well.

61
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,238
She lied to him. How can it end well?

62
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,618
Many stories begin with a mishap but have a happy ending.

63
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:07,507
She lied to him because she wanted to get the job.

64
00:06:07,664 --> 00:06:09,801
It's not because she wanted to scam him for money.

65
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,898
We have been helping his mom.

66
00:06:12,286 --> 00:06:15,706
If he only sees the bad things that she did,

67
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,404
it will be better for them to end their relationship.

68
00:06:23,781 --> 00:06:24,910
Mr. Vee.

69
00:06:25,498 --> 00:06:26,506
What?

70
00:06:27,764 --> 00:06:30,410
I'm sorry that I didn't tell you the truth about your mom.

71
00:06:32,096 --> 00:06:33,706
To be honest, I'm very upset.

72
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:37,230
I also feel very hurt.

73
00:06:41,972 --> 00:06:43,036
I understand that you...

74
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,804
We are not going to talk about this yet.

75
00:06:45,486 --> 00:06:47,740
I want to focus solely on my mom.

76
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,341
Alright.

77
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:57,823
Should we recap the steps on how to make the hot chocolate?

78
00:06:58,983 --> 00:07:00,221
Sure.

79
00:07:20,738 --> 00:07:21,516
Non.

80
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:23,943
Kem told me that Neeraaumpan disappeared.

81
00:07:24,649 --> 00:07:25,907
From the church?

82
00:07:26,101 --> 00:07:27,004
Yes.

83
00:07:28,283 --> 00:07:30,912
We need to find out why she disappeared.

84
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,907
Was it because she knew that we were looking for her or something else?

85
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:35,863
Now, Veekit is not around.

86
00:07:36,124 --> 00:07:39,609
Your grandpa is busy looking for his beloved grandson.

87
00:07:39,853 --> 00:07:44,380
I think this is your only chance for you to take over Next Innovation.

88
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,016
You need to do it now.

89
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,612
Before they find out the truth.

90
00:07:51,186 --> 00:07:53,816
We need to do it before Veekit comes back.

91
00:07:54,693 --> 00:07:58,510
Every time Veekit disappears,

92
00:07:58,795 --> 00:08:01,263
he always comes back stronger.

93
00:08:01,904 --> 00:08:05,060
I think if he comes back this time, he will become more mature.

94
00:08:05,412 --> 00:08:07,460
I will not only step up to be the new CEO,

95
00:08:07,883 --> 00:08:10,806
but I also need to block every way for Veekit to come back.

96
00:08:13,876 --> 00:08:18,116
I'm glad that you finally do something for yourself.

97
00:08:19,183 --> 00:08:23,136
When I am fully in charge of the company,

98
00:08:23,752 --> 00:08:27,941
everyone will accept that I am more talented than Veekit.

99
00:08:43,152 --> 00:08:44,046
You already got the recipe.

100
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,710
I think you should call it a day.

101
00:08:54,503 --> 00:08:55,413
Mr. Vee.

102
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,770
(Hot Chocolate Recipe)

103
00:09:30,872 --> 00:09:33,058
(We became a couple on 5 July.)

104
00:09:34,787 --> 00:09:37,120
Will you be my girlfriend, Mirin?

105
00:09:46,763 --> 00:09:48,301
(Mirin likes ice cream.)

106
00:09:51,801 --> 00:09:54,900
(Today, my girlfriend smells like sweets.)

107
00:09:54,915 --> 00:09:56,312
(She smells very yummy.)

108
00:09:57,266 --> 00:09:58,589
(I don't like when she talks back at me.)

109
00:09:58,595 --> 00:10:00,587
If I have an internal injury, I'll sue you.

110
00:10:00,598 --> 00:10:02,304
(I am the CEO of the company.)

111
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,600
(She likes to go to the green overpass with)

112
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,124
(Japanese vibes when she feels stressed.)

113
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:17,357
(I can't believe that)

114
00:10:17,382 --> 00:10:20,331
(I'm falling for a woman though I've never seen her face.)

115
00:10:26,724 --> 00:10:28,490
(How can you make it happen?)

116
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:48,130
(To Veekit)

117
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,541
I hope you get to read it soon.

118
00:11:52,923 --> 00:11:54,292
You were sleeping soundly.

119
00:11:54,309 --> 00:11:55,503
You must be tired.

120
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,106
I'm sorry for bothering you.

121
00:11:58,329 --> 00:11:59,218
I think I should leave.

122
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,216
Why don't you have breakfast with us?

123
00:12:01,838 --> 00:12:03,327
Do you know how to peel apples?

124
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,650
Can you do it for me?

125
00:12:04,663 --> 00:12:06,509
The food is all ready.

126
00:12:28,046 --> 00:12:29,609
How is your mom doing?

127
00:12:32,803 --> 00:12:34,536
Her memory still hasn't come back.

128
00:12:35,566 --> 00:12:39,343
The doctor told me to stimulate her memory in any way I could.

129
00:12:42,743 --> 00:12:45,316
While we had been taking care of Neeraaumpan,

130
00:12:45,618 --> 00:12:49,507
we always discussed whether we should tell you the truth.

131
00:12:50,072 --> 00:12:53,701
But your mom strongly insisted

132
00:12:54,683 --> 00:12:56,578
that she didn't want you to worry about her.

133
00:12:57,667 --> 00:13:00,180
There are no children who do not worry about their mother.

134
00:13:03,524 --> 00:13:05,403
Children worry about their mother.

135
00:13:05,724 --> 00:13:07,803
Mothers worry about their children.

136
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,464
They are different.

137
00:13:10,543 --> 00:13:16,010
She told me she knew how hard it is to run Next Innovation.

138
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:19,001
She doesn't want to be your burden.

139
00:13:21,283 --> 00:13:22,858
She has watched you from afar.

140
00:13:23,644 --> 00:13:25,380
She knows everything about you.

141
00:13:25,841 --> 00:13:27,783
When there are articles about you published,

142
00:13:27,792 --> 00:13:28,983
she will find and read them.

143
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,983
She also collects them.

144
00:13:32,326 --> 00:13:36,378
At least, she can have updates about me from the articles.

145
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,300
On the other hand,

146
00:13:39,781 --> 00:13:41,700
I asked myself every day,

147
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:43,906
why did she leave me?

148
00:13:44,796 --> 00:13:47,701
I didn't know that she left me because she loved me.

149
00:13:48,624 --> 00:13:50,930
No children would ever think that could be the reason.

150
00:13:55,481 --> 00:13:57,400
Thank you for taking care of my mom.

151
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:00,576
Thank you for helping her

152
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,776
though we are not related.

153
00:14:06,121 --> 00:14:07,907
Excuse me. I'm leaving.

154
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,907
I'm not hungry.

155
00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:15,701
Mirin went to invite Big Noi to join us.

156
00:14:17,801 --> 00:14:20,104
She insists that she wants to talk to you

157
00:14:21,475 --> 00:14:23,807
whether you two will continue to be business partners.

158
00:14:25,452 --> 00:14:28,018
She agreed to invest in your company because of you.

159
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:30,700
What do you want to do next?

160
00:14:31,049 --> 00:14:32,700
You need to talk to her about it.

161
00:14:35,776 --> 00:14:37,181
I thought you wouldn't come.

162
00:14:37,193 --> 00:14:38,998
I jokingly told my daughter to invite you.

163
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,121
But you came to join us for real.

164
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:43,236
Are you implicitly telling me to go home?

165
00:14:43,244 --> 00:14:46,240
No, it's just that you are always busy when we invite you.

166
00:14:46,255 --> 00:14:48,698
I am supposed to be busy.

167
00:14:49,069 --> 00:14:51,701
But I got kicked to the curb.

168
00:14:52,207 --> 00:14:54,140
I thought I would be busy.

169
00:14:54,292 --> 00:14:55,903
But suddenly I became unemployed.

170
00:14:57,987 --> 00:14:59,920
Big Noi, I...

171
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:00,993
Nee.

172
00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:02,993
You are this old.

173
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,180
Are you still able to bite off these hard pork rinds?

174
00:15:06,732 --> 00:15:08,076
I don't want to brag.

175
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,975
I can bite off human meat as well.

176
00:15:09,981 --> 00:15:12,386
She's biting off me every day.

177
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,229
You have been bitten off every day?

178
00:15:15,721 --> 00:15:16,510
But your size says differently.

179
00:15:17,976 --> 00:15:21,466
From your words, do you want me to bite your head off?

180
00:15:21,486 --> 00:15:22,632
I've been craving biting words for several days.

181
00:15:22,643 --> 00:15:24,172
It will be great to hear it.

182
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,343
We need to talk, young man.

183
00:15:35,986 --> 00:15:38,400
I want to talk to him privately.

184
00:15:40,284 --> 00:15:41,223
Follow me.

185
00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:49,301
Let them talk privately.

186
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:52,004
It's their company and money.

187
00:15:52,289 --> 00:15:53,338
It's not your business.

188
00:15:55,109 --> 00:15:56,006
Yes, Mom.

189
00:15:58,566 --> 00:16:02,181
What are you going to do with me and my investment?

190
00:16:04,335 --> 00:16:06,061
I still have no idea.

191
00:16:07,993 --> 00:16:09,303
I'm sorry.

192
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,686
I need to put things on hold for the meantime because...

193
00:16:12,693 --> 00:16:15,421
Because a lot of things are going on with you?

194
00:16:18,452 --> 00:16:19,309
Yes.

195
00:16:19,776 --> 00:16:21,620
It's very hard for me.

196
00:16:21,949 --> 00:16:22,918
I don't know what to do...

197
00:16:22,927 --> 00:16:25,061
Divide them into two categories.

198
00:16:25,481 --> 00:16:29,103
Things that you can change and things that you cannot change.

199
00:16:31,373 --> 00:16:32,298
What?

200
00:16:32,646 --> 00:16:35,609
You found your mother who had been missing for decades.

201
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:38,178
You are providing her medical treatment.

202
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:42,280
This is what you can do and wait to see the result.

203
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,498
Mirin lied to you.

204
00:16:44,773 --> 00:16:48,201
That blockhead is feeling very guilty.

205
00:16:48,495 --> 00:16:50,338
She is waiting for you to forgive her.

206
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:52,101
So you can continue your relationship.

207
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,901
About this,

208
00:16:55,309 --> 00:16:57,903
can you do it or not?

209
00:17:04,764 --> 00:17:06,906
Do you still love her?

210
00:17:13,835 --> 00:17:17,290
If there's a problem, then fix it.

211
00:17:17,635 --> 00:17:21,378
There are other serious issues waiting for you.

212
00:17:21,744 --> 00:17:24,976
I don't know what your plan is.

213
00:17:25,861 --> 00:17:31,543
But if you are removed from the position of the CEO of Next Innovation,

214
00:17:31,909 --> 00:17:33,943
you will be in deep trouble.

215
00:17:34,216 --> 00:17:36,578
You won't be able to protect anyone.

216
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,424
You need to go back to the company as soon as possible.

217
00:17:39,436 --> 00:17:41,458
I'd been through this path before.

218
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,201
Yes.

219
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,863
From all the things that happen in your life,

220
00:17:48,263 --> 00:17:53,004
I think there is only one thing that you cannot change.

221
00:17:55,338 --> 00:17:58,100
Now, Chanon has turned against you.

222
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,500
When you can accept the truth,

223
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:02,778
you need to find a way to handle it.

224
00:18:02,795 --> 00:18:05,743
If there's anything I can help, you can always tell me.

225
00:18:09,072 --> 00:18:11,741
This is because you're my niece's boyfriend.

226
00:18:16,633 --> 00:18:18,300
Mirin.

227
00:18:19,032 --> 00:18:20,201
Come out.

228
00:18:20,215 --> 00:18:22,201
Stop eavesdropping on our conversation.

229
00:18:23,607 --> 00:18:26,995
I...I just...

230
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:32,098
From now on, I hire you to work for me.

231
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:33,809
What?

232
00:18:34,635 --> 00:18:37,620
Mirin is my staff that I send to work with you.

233
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,901
Hurry and go fix your problems.

234
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,180
I want to invest with you.

235
00:18:45,107 --> 00:18:45,909
Got it?

236
00:18:51,261 --> 00:18:52,061
Aunt Noi.

237
00:18:52,672 --> 00:18:54,113
I'll walk you out.

238
00:18:56,095 --> 00:18:58,060
Take good care of him.

239
00:18:58,263 --> 00:18:59,806
He has been through a lot.

240
00:18:59,992 --> 00:19:01,821
His business may collapse with him.

241
00:19:03,236 --> 00:19:07,460
Mirin, you need to stop being amateurish and clumsy.

242
00:19:07,658 --> 00:19:10,504
For a big company like this, there's a lot of politics in the workplace.

243
00:19:10,723 --> 00:19:13,573
If you choose to be by his side,

244
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,504
You need to be competent.

245
00:19:16,052 --> 00:19:17,975
If you still don't understand the situation,

246
00:19:17,984 --> 00:19:22,298
You should go watch a Korean series about succession battles.

247
00:19:24,607 --> 00:19:26,340
Yes, dowager queen.

248
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,355
Both business and relationship are chaotic.

249
00:19:32,366 --> 00:19:34,230
That's why I stay single.

250
00:19:34,246 --> 00:19:35,616
The end of the problems.

251
00:19:58,215 --> 00:19:59,906
What are you going to do next?

252
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,180
What are you talking about?

253
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,576
I...

254
00:20:06,316 --> 00:20:07,696
I'm talking about everything.

255
00:20:08,176 --> 00:20:11,804
Mainly about your mom

256
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,261
and the company.

257
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,176
What about us?

258
00:20:20,593 --> 00:20:22,604
I don't dare to think about it.

259
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:27,700
I did wrong to you in a way that you should not forgive me.

260
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,015
I lied to you.

261
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,781
I hid the truth from you.

262
00:20:33,463 --> 00:20:34,907
I deceived you.

263
00:20:37,284 --> 00:20:41,621
It's so wrong that I don't dare to ask you about our future.

264
00:20:46,392 --> 00:20:47,943
But I still want to help you

265
00:20:48,966 --> 00:20:49,943
on everything.

266
00:20:50,692 --> 00:20:55,307
If there's anything you think I can help,

267
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,703
please let me know.

268
00:20:57,975 --> 00:20:59,418
I'm happy to do it.

269
00:21:08,086 --> 00:21:09,706
You are the only one

270
00:21:10,741 --> 00:21:12,376
who knows me better than anyone.

271
00:21:13,627 --> 00:21:15,978
You also know my mom best.

272
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,744
I still want you to walk together with me.

273
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:20,904
I want you to be by my side

274
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,816
when my mom remembers me.

275
00:21:27,336 --> 00:21:28,501
I'm happy to do that.

276
00:21:30,515 --> 00:21:31,304
Good.

277
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,304
Let's go.

278
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:47,980
Aren't you still mad at me?

279
00:21:48,886 --> 00:21:49,806
Yes.

280
00:21:52,623 --> 00:21:54,678
But I still want to hold your hand and walk together.

281
00:21:55,258 --> 00:21:56,378
I don't know why.

282
00:22:12,072 --> 00:22:14,380
Why did you call me to dine out with you?

283
00:22:15,429 --> 00:22:16,506
Is it because you feel lonely?

284
00:22:18,058 --> 00:22:19,615
I'm way past that.

285
00:22:21,283 --> 00:22:22,421
That's probably true.

286
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:26,407
I have a question to ask you.

287
00:22:26,896 --> 00:22:27,621
What?

288
00:22:30,566 --> 00:22:32,300
What is your goal?

289
00:22:33,983 --> 00:22:34,698
Huh?

290
00:22:35,118 --> 00:22:37,261
You had always been the top in everything you did since you were young.

291
00:22:38,075 --> 00:22:39,661
You grew up well.

292
00:22:40,104 --> 00:22:42,178
You became the woman your family wanted you to be.

293
00:22:42,689 --> 00:22:44,306
Your profile is great.

294
00:22:45,501 --> 00:22:47,312
You are no longer interested in Veekit.

295
00:22:47,724 --> 00:22:49,815
You are increasing your investment in the stock market.

296
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,023
I want to know

297
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:53,424
what your next goal is.

298
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,258
What is the goal of your life?

299
00:22:58,949 --> 00:23:02,812
Chanon, stop acting like my dad.

300
00:23:04,435 --> 00:23:05,703
I'm just asking.

301
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,806
Anyway.

302
00:23:09,369 --> 00:23:11,200
If you are interested,

303
00:23:11,921 --> 00:23:14,103
I want to ask you to do business with me.

304
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:17,100
I want you to be a major partner,

305
00:23:17,744 --> 00:23:19,404
a principal shareholder,

306
00:23:19,784 --> 00:23:23,741
and the deputy CEO of Next Innovation.

307
00:23:26,761 --> 00:23:30,209
But I don't want to interrupt your joyful life.

308
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:31,346
I only ask...

309
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:32,906
I'm interested in your offer.

310
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:35,378
But first of all,

311
00:23:35,895 --> 00:23:38,606
you need to become the CEO.

312
00:23:40,249 --> 00:23:41,909
What about your grandfather?

313
00:23:42,869 --> 00:23:44,306
What are you going to do with him?

314
00:23:47,421 --> 00:23:48,803
Just as you know,

315
00:23:48,816 --> 00:23:52,183
this is the first time that my grandpa took a long leave from work

316
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:53,624
to look for Veekit.

317
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,826
It means that the big boss is not around.

318
00:23:56,838 --> 00:24:01,206
The major shareholder, Big Noi, refuses to invest with me.

319
00:24:01,629 --> 00:24:03,200
In simple words,

320
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:05,404
if I announce to sell my shares

321
00:24:05,843 --> 00:24:07,103
and you buy them,

322
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:11,821
you will become the majority shareholder in the company.

323
00:24:12,178 --> 00:24:16,580
Then my mom will call a meeting to change the CEO.

324
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:21,707
If I become the majority shareholder

325
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,116
and I vote for you,

326
00:24:25,078 --> 00:24:27,373
there will be a new CEO.

327
00:24:28,866 --> 00:24:33,012
I will announce the appointment of a new deputy CEO.

328
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:43,909
So the new CEO of Next Innovation will be Chanon Kanchanarak.

329
00:24:48,109 --> 00:24:48,898
Deal.

330
00:24:48,915 --> 00:24:50,107
I'm in.

331
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:56,540
Deal, Miss Tanya.

332
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,215
About what Big Noi said,

333
00:25:07,709 --> 00:25:09,798
that Chanon turned against me.

334
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:12,818
What do you think about that?

335
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:18,206
All this time,

336
00:25:18,221 --> 00:25:20,143
you did what you needed to do

337
00:25:20,592 --> 00:25:22,541
under the conditions that you have.

338
00:25:22,976 --> 00:25:24,416
So did Chanon.

339
00:25:25,233 --> 00:25:28,375
You two didn't do it to hurt each other.

340
00:25:29,009 --> 00:25:31,981
Because of the people around you and your work,

341
00:25:32,469 --> 00:25:33,981
things turned out this way.

342
00:25:35,361 --> 00:25:37,178
What do you think Non wants?

343
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:39,578
Acceptance from your grandfather.

344
00:25:44,781 --> 00:25:46,006
To tell you the truth,

345
00:25:46,621 --> 00:25:48,660
I never thought of competing with Non.

346
00:25:49,444 --> 00:25:51,501
My face blindness

347
00:25:52,526 --> 00:25:54,660
and the extra attention my granddad has given me,

348
00:25:56,367 --> 00:25:58,806
I chose neither of them.

349
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:04,206
Non is my brother.

350
00:26:06,764 --> 00:26:08,341
He's not my enemy.

351
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:09,820
Just thinking that

352
00:26:09,845 --> 00:26:12,082
I have to carry these feelings with me and compete with him,

353
00:26:12,633 --> 00:26:14,461
it's so tiring.

354
00:26:18,275 --> 00:26:19,512
To be honest,

355
00:26:20,629 --> 00:26:22,710
If he wants something from me,

356
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,201
I can give him everything.

357
00:26:27,129 --> 00:26:28,310
Except...

358
00:26:39,489 --> 00:26:42,464
I think you should focus on one thing at a time.

359
00:26:43,529 --> 00:26:45,729
All these things are important to you.

360
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:47,729
But right now,

361
00:26:47,769 --> 00:26:51,104
the most important thing to you is your mom.

362
00:27:27,975 --> 00:27:29,406
I made it for you.

363
00:27:36,641 --> 00:27:39,009
You are so kind.

364
00:28:27,458 --> 00:28:28,904
Thank you very much.

365
00:28:29,433 --> 00:28:33,261
The hot chocolate you made is very delicious.

366
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:38,409
Can you tell me the recipe later?

367
00:29:03,732 --> 00:29:05,580
Do you miss your son today?

368
00:29:06,313 --> 00:29:07,203
Son?

369
00:29:08,741 --> 00:29:09,706
What son?

370
00:29:10,709 --> 00:29:11,938
Whose son?

371
00:29:37,355 --> 00:29:38,612
Mr. Vee.

372
00:29:45,543 --> 00:29:47,504
What if I came too late?

373
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:51,498
What if everything is too late?

374
00:29:55,083 --> 00:29:56,810
Calm down, Mr. Vee.

375
00:29:57,335 --> 00:29:59,003
Everything takes time.

376
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,900
Why am I losing everyone?

377
00:30:06,769 --> 00:30:07,804
My mom.

378
00:30:08,906 --> 00:30:10,003
Non.

379
00:30:11,715 --> 00:30:13,103
But you still have me.

380
00:30:15,387 --> 00:30:18,403
Even though you are mad or hate me,

381
00:30:19,841 --> 00:30:21,307
I'm still by your side.

382
00:31:03,915 --> 00:31:06,500
Let's work together to help your mom remember you.

383
00:31:07,872 --> 00:31:09,255
Let's do it together.

384
00:31:22,087 --> 00:31:25,126
(In the latest report, Next Innovation shares)

385
00:31:25,151 --> 00:31:27,441
(are available for sale again.)

386
00:31:27,455 --> 00:31:31,661
(This is the order of the acting CEO, Chanon Kanchanarak.)

387
00:31:31,913 --> 00:31:37,107
(It's unknown where Mr. Prapob and Mr. Veekit Kraipiwat are.)

388
00:31:37,121 --> 00:31:40,147
(It's rumored that they have stepped down.)

389
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:42,758
(Both Thai and international investors)

390
00:31:42,783 --> 00:31:45,933
(show great interest in the company.)

391
00:31:45,952 --> 00:31:49,960
(They strongly believe that Chanon)

392
00:31:49,985 --> 00:31:52,435
(will bring new changes to the company.)

393
00:31:52,449 --> 00:31:56,393
(So they are willing to invest and support this share selling.)

394
00:32:00,803 --> 00:32:02,203
Mr. Vee.

395
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:04,016
Mrs. Neeraaumpan has disappeared.

396
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,016
Mom.

397
00:32:12,553 --> 00:32:13,307
Mom.

398
00:32:20,458 --> 00:32:21,403
Mom.

399
00:32:22,669 --> 00:32:23,507
Mom.

400
00:32:24,341 --> 00:32:25,340
Mom.

401
00:32:25,435 --> 00:32:26,312
Mom.

402
00:32:32,395 --> 00:32:33,412
Good boy.

403
00:32:36,009 --> 00:32:39,580
My son used to be at your age.

404
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,304
Back then, we got separated like you.

405
00:32:43,961 --> 00:32:47,315
But he's all grown up now.

406
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,704
He is tall and handsome.

407
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,621
Mom.

408
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,023
Good, come here.

409
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:58,572
Thank you.

410
00:32:58,587 --> 00:33:00,150
- Say thank you to the aunt. - Thank you.

411
00:33:01,443 --> 00:33:04,006
Where have you been? I told you to wait for me here.

412
00:33:18,058 --> 00:33:19,100
Is that you, Vee?

413
00:33:24,563 --> 00:33:25,912
Is that you, Vee?

414
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,709
Mom.

415
00:33:41,863 --> 00:33:42,438
Vee.

416
00:33:42,853 --> 00:33:43,944
Vee.

417
00:33:44,553 --> 00:33:45,504
Vee.

418
00:33:46,795 --> 00:33:47,701
I...

419
00:33:47,846 --> 00:33:48,801
I...

420
00:33:49,076 --> 00:33:50,503
I'm sorry.

421
00:33:57,295 --> 00:33:58,210
Vee.

422
00:33:59,646 --> 00:34:01,578
I'm really sorry.

423
00:34:02,104 --> 00:34:03,698
Please don't be mad at me.

424
00:34:04,255 --> 00:34:06,704
I'm not mad at you.

425
00:34:08,152 --> 00:34:10,015
How could I be mad at you?

426
00:34:11,724 --> 00:34:14,018
I should be the one apologizing.

427
00:34:15,043 --> 00:34:18,423
I took too long to find you.

428
00:34:18,944 --> 00:34:20,306
Honey.

429
00:34:21,423 --> 00:34:22,700
Vee.

430
00:34:29,636 --> 00:34:31,183
It's really you.

431
00:34:33,749 --> 00:34:36,113
You look even better than in the photos.

432
00:34:41,841 --> 00:34:43,858
You have not changed at all.

433
00:34:58,746 --> 00:35:01,700
Vee, do you see my face?

434
00:35:03,867 --> 00:35:06,172
Mirin said you have face blindness.

435
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,507
I see it.

436
00:35:09,247 --> 00:35:10,461
I can see it now, Mom.

437
00:35:10,993 --> 00:35:12,213
I can see it.

438
00:35:13,715 --> 00:35:15,595
I can see everything.

439
00:35:16,624 --> 00:35:18,370
I see that you are looking at me.

440
00:35:18,878 --> 00:35:20,706
I see how you feel.

441
00:35:20,806 --> 00:35:22,616
I see that you are worried about me.

442
00:35:23,818 --> 00:35:24,716
I can see it now.

443
00:35:25,023 --> 00:35:26,915
I can see it. I see everything.

444
00:35:27,483 --> 00:35:28,803
Vee, my boy.

445
00:35:34,398 --> 00:35:35,858
Vee, my boy.

446
00:35:36,858 --> 00:35:38,701
Please don't be mad at me.

447
00:35:39,818 --> 00:35:41,401
I'm not mad at you.

448
00:36:08,815 --> 00:36:10,060
Is that you, Mirin?

449
00:36:10,246 --> 00:36:15,461
(I can look but I just can't see)

450
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:17,766
(Your true feelings for me)

451
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:20,863
(Hidden like a mystery)

452
00:36:22,447 --> 00:36:24,461
You look so cute.

453
00:36:24,604 --> 00:36:29,064
(Please help me truly see)

454
00:36:29,269 --> 00:36:32,538
(You're my true love for eternity)

455
00:36:42,689 --> 00:36:44,104
Mrs. Neeraaumpan.

456
00:36:50,689 --> 00:36:52,407
Is your memory back?

457
00:36:54,987 --> 00:36:57,209
How long have I been gone this time?

458
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:00,461
Yes, you've been gone for a long time.

459
00:37:01,718 --> 00:37:03,506
We should hurry and go talk.

460
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:06,103
There are a lot of things we need to discuss.

461
00:37:16,612 --> 00:37:18,633
This is a document appointing Mr. Veekit as your guardian.

462
00:37:18,646 --> 00:37:20,104
You should sign it now.

463
00:37:22,075 --> 00:37:23,609
Mom, don't worry.

464
00:37:24,186 --> 00:37:25,901
No one knows about this.

465
00:37:26,483 --> 00:37:28,204
I'll take you home.

466
00:37:28,783 --> 00:37:30,140
I'll get you medical treatment.

467
00:37:30,641 --> 00:37:33,104
You will be safe at home with me.

468
00:37:33,996 --> 00:37:35,896
No one will bother you again.

469
00:37:37,387 --> 00:37:40,104
You can live without worries.

470
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:44,604
Are you sure?

471
00:37:46,101 --> 00:37:48,536
I can live here...

472
00:37:48,544 --> 00:37:50,704
I don't want to separate from you again.

473
00:37:51,935 --> 00:37:56,703
It doesn't matter if you remember or forget me.

474
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,300
I'll take care of you.

475
00:38:01,403 --> 00:38:03,606
Mirin will also be by my side.

476
00:38:04,036 --> 00:38:06,026
We will take care of you.

477
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:15,424
Please take care of Vee and me.

478
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:17,620
Sure.

479
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:23,606
Let the doctor examine you while your memory is back.

480
00:38:23,621 --> 00:38:25,124
So he can ask you about your conditions.

481
00:38:25,138 --> 00:38:26,703
I'll get the doctor.

482
00:38:35,907 --> 00:38:37,806
Can I take a photo with you?

483
00:38:38,618 --> 00:38:40,701
When you forget who I am,

484
00:38:41,869 --> 00:38:43,578
I'll show you the photo.

485
00:38:56,435 --> 00:38:57,947
Mirin, come here.

486
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,609
Come and take photos with us.

487
00:39:23,975 --> 00:39:24,824
Hey.

488
00:39:26,498 --> 00:39:28,418
You can't suddenly turn around.

489
00:39:29,187 --> 00:39:30,509
I'm still not used to it.

490
00:39:30,678 --> 00:39:33,221
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

491
00:39:37,466 --> 00:39:38,178
Hey.

492
00:39:38,453 --> 00:39:40,200
Do I look that terrible?

493
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:44,493
No.

494
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,016
You look okay.

495
00:39:46,046 --> 00:39:47,107
You look okay.

496
00:39:48,763 --> 00:39:50,913
You look cute.

497
00:39:51,423 --> 00:39:53,603
You are surprisingly cute.

498
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:59,981
What do you mean by "surprisingly cute"?

499
00:40:04,781 --> 00:40:06,607
You make my heart race.

500
00:40:10,155 --> 00:40:11,512
Then you need to learn to get used to it.

501
00:40:31,289 --> 00:40:35,180
Your facial features are small like toppings on pizza bianca.

502
00:40:48,953 --> 00:40:49,915
Wait.

503
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:52,620
If you are this cute,

504
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,793
how cute I will be.

505
00:40:58,406 --> 00:40:59,307
Wait a second.

506
00:40:59,316 --> 00:41:01,743
I need to go look in a mirror again and get a good look at myself.

507
00:41:11,484 --> 00:41:12,609
It's done.

508
00:41:14,813 --> 00:41:15,907
Everyone.

509
00:41:16,612 --> 00:41:20,904
This is our new majority shareholder, Miss Tanya.

510
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:34,418
Thank you.

511
00:41:34,744 --> 00:41:36,501
I'll do my best.

512
00:41:36,669 --> 00:41:39,852
I'll do everything that I can.

513
00:41:40,503 --> 00:41:45,509
I'm here to fully support Next Innovation led by Chanon.

514
00:41:46,953 --> 00:41:48,218
Please give me your advice.

515
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:03,298
Thank you and welcome to Next Innovation, Tanya.

516
00:42:03,658 --> 00:42:05,703
I'll take good care of you.

517
00:42:06,078 --> 00:42:07,558
Thank you too.

518
00:42:07,569 --> 00:42:09,295
I'll do my best as well.

519
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:11,381
Let's crush them.

520
00:42:12,752 --> 00:42:13,778
Aew-aes.

521
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:16,904
Can you schedule a meeting with Manit's team tomorrow?

522
00:42:17,006 --> 00:42:18,537
I want to launch the new application

523
00:42:18,562 --> 00:42:20,431
under Tanya's supervision as soon as possible.

524
00:42:20,456 --> 00:42:22,103
So our status becomes more secure.

525
00:42:23,427 --> 00:42:24,496
Sure, Mr. Non.

526
00:42:25,601 --> 00:42:27,656
A reporter contacted me asking for an interview with you.

527
00:42:27,673 --> 00:42:29,055
Are you interested in doing it?

528
00:42:30,363 --> 00:42:31,627
Congrats.

529
00:42:32,541 --> 00:42:33,506
Sure.

530
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,578
Tell him to meet me tomorrow.

531
00:42:35,975 --> 00:42:36,778
This is good.

532
00:42:37,067 --> 00:42:38,872
We can inform him of the good news.

533
00:42:39,761 --> 00:42:40,506
Alright.

534
00:42:40,527 --> 00:42:42,532
I'll schedule the interview in the afternoon.

535
00:42:42,547 --> 00:42:45,103
I'll set up your meeting with Manit in the morning.

536
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,584
Thank you.

537
00:42:46,596 --> 00:42:47,300
Sure.

538
00:42:47,861 --> 00:42:52,752
I'll wait a few days before I nominate you to be the new CEO.

539
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,703
Thank you, Mrs. Sroyphet.

540
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:57,966
Congratulations, my son.

541
00:43:00,258 --> 00:43:01,936
Sister, are you sure you don't want to come with us?

542
00:43:02,326 --> 00:43:03,978
I can give you a ride.

543
00:43:04,972 --> 00:43:06,100
It's okay.

544
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,298
The church has sent a car to pick me up.

545
00:43:09,326 --> 00:43:10,607
Please keep me in touch.

546
00:43:14,132 --> 00:43:16,318
Thank you so much for everything.

547
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,738
Thank you very much.

548
00:43:21,347 --> 00:43:23,532
You have been taking good care of me for all these years.

549
00:43:23,541 --> 00:43:24,712
Thank you so much.

550
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,938
Please thank Father for me.

551
00:43:28,184 --> 00:43:31,004
If I have a chance, I will go visit you as soon as possible.

552
00:43:31,821 --> 00:43:32,484
Sure.

553
00:43:32,495 --> 00:43:33,946
You don't need to hurry.

554
00:43:34,003 --> 00:43:36,021
Wait until your condition gets better.

555
00:43:38,561 --> 00:43:39,621
Mirin.

556
00:43:39,815 --> 00:43:41,700
You have to come to visit us.

557
00:43:42,136 --> 00:43:46,404
Otherwise, everyone at the church will miss your tasty desserts.

558
00:43:46,696 --> 00:43:47,803
Don't worry.

559
00:43:47,816 --> 00:43:50,501
I'll go visit you often and make lots of desserts for you.

560
00:43:52,813 --> 00:43:53,613
Let's go, Mom.

561
00:43:53,687 --> 00:43:54,618
Excuse us.

562
00:44:10,984 --> 00:44:13,053
I have surveillanced the church for days.

563
00:44:13,069 --> 00:44:15,110
I saw no signs of Neeraaumpan.

564
00:44:16,049 --> 00:44:17,706
Mirin didn't go to the church at all.

565
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,509
Veekit is nowhere to be seen.

566
00:44:21,587 --> 00:44:22,803
What did people at the church tell you?

567
00:44:23,441 --> 00:44:26,110
They said Neeraaumpan left the church.

568
00:44:26,901 --> 00:44:28,695
No one knew where she went.

569
00:44:29,243 --> 00:44:31,703
I asked them about her but no one knew.

570
00:44:32,261 --> 00:44:34,536
I was searching for her from her old information.

571
00:44:35,023 --> 00:44:37,620
She has no other family members.

572
00:44:37,898 --> 00:44:39,307
She doesn't have another house.

573
00:44:39,867 --> 00:44:43,463
Besides the church, she has nowhere else to go.

574
00:44:44,029 --> 00:44:47,436
I think she must have been so scared that she disappeared

575
00:44:47,449 --> 00:44:48,796
and won't go back to the church.

576
00:44:48,809 --> 00:44:50,183
That is her business.

577
00:44:50,195 --> 00:44:52,938
I want to know where she is.

578
00:44:53,113 --> 00:44:54,503
I don't care whether she is dead or alive.

579
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:57,544
I just want to know for sure where she is.

580
00:44:57,826 --> 00:45:00,421
What do you want me to do?

581
00:45:01,487 --> 00:45:02,373
Keep following them.

582
00:45:02,389 --> 00:45:04,024
Follow Veekit, Mirin, and everyone.

583
00:45:04,436 --> 00:45:06,803
Make sure that they can't backstab us.

584
00:45:09,546 --> 00:45:10,403
You can go now.

585
00:45:18,961 --> 00:45:19,776
Mom.

586
00:45:20,136 --> 00:45:21,616
This is Dr. Seen.

587
00:45:21,632 --> 00:45:22,375
Hello.

588
00:45:22,604 --> 00:45:23,901
He's my childhood friend.

589
00:45:24,104 --> 00:45:25,606
I'm not sure if you can remember him.

590
00:45:25,858 --> 00:45:27,903
Seen, this is Mirin.

591
00:45:28,704 --> 00:45:29,541
Hello.

592
00:45:30,636 --> 00:45:33,387
Seen will come to take care of you here.

593
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,912
I'll have a nurse taking care of you as well.

594
00:45:36,361 --> 00:45:37,600
Seen.

595
00:45:38,109 --> 00:45:39,143
Do you have any advice for us?

596
00:45:39,147 --> 00:45:42,460
How we should take care of her?

597
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:44,763
Tell you the truth.

598
00:45:44,776 --> 00:45:49,207
Alzheimer's disease is incurable.

599
00:45:49,783 --> 00:45:52,264
All we can do is provide palliative care to you

600
00:45:52,275 --> 00:45:55,661
and slow down your memory loss as much as possible.

601
00:45:57,309 --> 00:46:01,852
I want you to do the memory exercises often.

602
00:46:01,863 --> 00:46:03,304
It will be a great help for you.

603
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:07,116
I'll try.

604
00:46:07,546 --> 00:46:08,309
Alright.

605
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:14,340
I arranged the medicine that you need.

606
00:46:14,773 --> 00:46:17,421
You need to adhere to your medication schedule

607
00:46:17,446 --> 00:46:19,164
and complete the full course.

608
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:22,303
Thanks a lot.

609
00:46:22,727 --> 00:46:23,940
You look cool.

610
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:27,738
What?

611
00:46:29,552 --> 00:46:31,538
Mirin, are you his secretary?

612
00:46:31,833 --> 00:46:32,604
Yes.

613
00:46:33,469 --> 00:46:37,043
Can I have your contact info?

614
00:46:37,056 --> 00:46:41,306
If I have something to tell you, we can contact each other.

615
00:46:41,315 --> 00:46:41,832
Sure.

616
00:46:41,843 --> 00:46:43,507
You don't need to do that.

617
00:46:43,767 --> 00:46:44,512
Why?

618
00:46:44,621 --> 00:46:46,775
You can contact me directly if you have something to tell us.

619
00:46:46,915 --> 00:46:48,418
Contact me only. Okay?

620
00:46:48,969 --> 00:46:50,304
That's it. Period.

621
00:46:54,166 --> 00:46:55,106
Okay.

622
00:46:56,378 --> 00:46:59,029
I'll come to visit you next week.

623
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,218
If something unusual or odd happens,

624
00:47:01,229 --> 00:47:02,735
you can call me anytime.

625
00:47:04,138 --> 00:47:05,198
Thanks a lot, man.

626
00:47:05,615 --> 00:47:09,806
Don't forget to remind the nurse to keep this a secret.

627
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:10,527
Okay.

628
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:11,664
Sure. I'll take care of it.

629
00:47:12,884 --> 00:47:13,430
See you.

630
00:47:13,446 --> 00:47:14,409
- See you. - Goodbye.

631
00:47:22,429 --> 00:47:23,301
Mom.

632
00:47:25,881 --> 00:47:26,703
Okay.

633
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:34,210
Hey, you.

634
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:36,918
Why don't we print out the childhood

635
00:47:36,943 --> 00:47:39,626
and current photos of you and your mom

636
00:47:39,646 --> 00:47:41,104
and place them all over the house?

637
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:43,044
That's a good idea.

638
00:47:43,055 --> 00:47:43,969
Great.

639
00:47:43,976 --> 00:47:47,210
You are talented, beautiful, and smart.

640
00:47:50,876 --> 00:47:51,807
I saw that.

641
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:56,501
Right.

642
00:48:13,153 --> 00:48:15,904
I may have to ask you to take care of my mom sometimes.

643
00:48:17,293 --> 00:48:18,107
Sure.

644
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,006
If there's anything I can help, please let me know.

645
00:48:23,138 --> 00:48:25,138
Can you be my girlfriend again?

646
00:48:28,715 --> 00:48:29,603
What?

647
00:48:32,753 --> 00:48:34,618
Can you be my girlfriend again?

648
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:37,023
What?

649
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:39,701
What? I can't hear you.

650
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:12,250
Directed by Ekkasit Trakulkasemsuk and Pantip Vibultham

651
00:49:20,512 --> 00:49:22,207
What are you doing?

652
00:49:24,575 --> 00:49:26,036
I am getting updates on the company's work

653
00:49:26,061 --> 00:49:27,939
as much as my access level is allowed.

654
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:31,204
Does this mean you are going back to work?

655
00:49:32,432 --> 00:49:33,261
Yes.

656
00:49:34,324 --> 00:49:35,906
I'm going back to compete with Chanon.

657
00:49:44,998 --> 00:49:47,616
Call a meeting with everyone today at 11 am.

658
00:49:47,841 --> 00:49:49,698
Thank you for attending this meeting.

659
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:51,632
I would like to propose to the board

660
00:49:51,657 --> 00:49:53,534
to remove Veekit from the CEO of Next Innovation.

661
00:49:53,723 --> 00:49:56,704
I'm confident if they win,

662
00:49:56,838 --> 00:49:59,006
I will be a loser who has nothing left.

663
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:02,423
Actually, you don't need to go this far.

664
00:50:02,809 --> 00:50:06,023
I'm begging you to leave my people alone.

665
00:50:06,324 --> 00:50:10,609
Don't use your pain to cause trouble to other people.
