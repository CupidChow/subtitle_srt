1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,179
If it's you who takes care of Next.

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,599
But I won't, if Tanya is in the picture.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,919
Please don't work yourself up, Granddad.

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,619
We'll make sure to make things right.

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,139
Vee, we need to talk about Next tonight.

6
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:13,760
That's good, actually.

7
00:00:13,761 --> 00:00:15,860
We need to come up with a way to turn the table on her.

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,399
You look like a brother superhero duo who's about to kick some bad guys' butts.

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,559
I'll be here rooting for you,

10
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,699
and I'll help you both in any way I can,

11
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:31,379
I'm afraid she won't hesitate to thoroughly squash us,

12
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,580
and take Next as her own, like Granddad said.

13
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,899
Wake up, boss.

14
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,139
Let's start working.

15
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,040
What?

16
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:11,879
Wait.

17
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,059
Why are you two...

18
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,339
Mirin called me last night.

19
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,819
She asked me to help liberate Next.

20
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:22,019
Hot coffee and sweets from my family to give you good energy.

21
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,199
Let's get going, Mirin.

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,200
Let's go, boss.

23
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,200
My girlfriend is so sweet.

24
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,420
I wish I had one too.

25
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,739

THE HAPPIEST MERRY-GO-ROUND

32
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,279
Girlfriend.

33
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,619
There are no customers in this age group in here.

34
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,480
What if we add this in?

35
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,579
Girlfriend, didn't you say you have a headache?

36
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,160
Everyone, let's go back to work.

37
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,559
Let's follow this plan.

38
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,299
I think we call it a day.

39
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,759
So we can visit Granddad at the hospital.

40
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,639
Good.

41
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,339
Thank you two for coming to help us here.

42
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,899
My pleasure.

43
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:39,840
That's right.

44
00:03:39,841 --> 00:03:42,139
If there's anything else you want me to do, let me know.

45
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,699
I'll take care of it.

46
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,619
I think our plan is pretty good.

47
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,960
Now, we wait and see if Tanya will make a move like we've predicted.

48
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,359
Girlfriend.

49
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,239
Thank you so much.

50
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,859
If I didn't have you,

51
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,160
things would have been much harder.

52
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,759
You're welcome.

53
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,879
You are my boyfriend.

54
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,339
If there's anything I can help, I will do it.

55
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,320
I will help you all the way.

56
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,419
Thank you so much.

57
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,900
Thank you too.

58
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,439
Mr. Chanon, don't worry.

59
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,159
I'll help you all the way

60
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,239
as your secretary.

61
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,399
Thank you so much.

62
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,859
Thank you.

63
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,879
Are you mocking me?

64
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,880
Thank you.

65
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,659
Thank you.

66
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,120
I'll let you borrow my hand.

67
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,660
Thank you.

68
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,579
Dad.

69
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,020
How long have you been awake?

70
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,179
Do you need anything?

71
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,399
I'll call the nurse.

72
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,439
No, it's okay.

73
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,699
I want some water.

74
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,580
Sure.

75
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,080
Where are my grandsons?

76
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,280
They are resolving the company's problems.

77
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,399
Since they are working together,

78
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,400
there's nothing we need to worry about.

79
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,780
What's wrong, honey?

80
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,939
Dad.

81
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,619
I'm sorry.

82
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,319
It's my fault.

83
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,719
If I didn't get so competitive,

84
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,239
If I didn't instill my resentment in Chanon,

85
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,679
things wouldn't have turned out this way.

86
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,999
We both wronged each other.

87
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,839
I wronged you.

88
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,659
But I still need you.

89
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,380
You also still need you.

90
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,659
This is how family is.

91
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:17,980
Let bygones be bygones.

92
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,039
Granddad, how are you feeling?

93
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,719
I'm much better now.

94
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,479
Next time, if you feel unwell, you need to tell us.

95
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,259
Whether it's serious or not, you need to tell us.

96
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,659
I saw that you were working on your problems,

97
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,820
how could I tell you about my problem?

98
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,679
We found a plan to fix the problems.

99
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,799
Our company will be fine.

100
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,320
The most important thing is that you two are doing alright.

101
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:13,679
Do you know why I am so worried about the company?

102
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,999
I'm doing all this for my family.

103
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,819
I hope that my daughter and grandsons can continue to live good and comfortable lives like this.

104
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:29,519
The company is the only thing I can leave for you.

105
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,840
It's what I can build when I'm still alive.

106
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,479
Then you can't leave us yet.

107
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,099
When Non and I,

108
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,499
When we take Next back,

109
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,500
Granddad

110
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,840
Grandpa

111
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:55,620
you will get to see the company grow bigger.

112
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,679
Tomorrow,

113
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,780
we will make you proud.

114
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:16,159
A group of application users who are affected by the data breach and have not been compensated is gathering at Next Innovation.

115
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:24,160
There are no updates from the company's CEO, Mr. Chanon, and the majority shareholder, Miss Tanya.

116
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,340
(Protestors demands for compensation from Next Innovation.)

117
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,300
Did you see the news?

118
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,699
I think Tanya has made her move.

119
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,850
Let's fight back.

120
00:08:59,974 --> 00:09:01,460
What should we do, Miss Tanya?

121
00:09:01,585 --> 00:09:03,600
Mr. Chanon is not here yet.

122
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:07,238
We should hold a press conference regarding the compensation right away.

123
00:09:07,251 --> 00:09:08,802
It's not going to cause any deficit to us anyway.

124
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,515
If you do nothing, our company may be sued for bankruptcy.

125
00:09:12,613 --> 00:09:14,100
Shh!

126
00:09:15,835 --> 00:09:17,607
Why do you look so anxious?

127
00:09:18,084 --> 00:09:20,005
You are just employees.

128
00:09:21,315 --> 00:09:22,567
Are you worried that you may lose your job?

129
00:09:27,521 --> 00:09:29,500
About the protestors,

130
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:32,536
I cannot take any action on behalf of Chanon.

131
00:09:33,057 --> 00:09:34,702
Because I'm not the company's CEO.

132
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:38,542
But you can vote for me to replace him as the new CEO.

133
00:09:40,856 --> 00:09:42,902
Then I can fix the problem for you.

134
00:09:43,277 --> 00:09:46,613
It won't take long before you can sip your coffee

135
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,134
and get back to your work.

136
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:51,524
Come out now.

137
00:09:53,063 --> 00:09:54,537
Come out.

138
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:56,137
Come out now.

139
00:09:56,148 --> 00:09:57,198
Come out!

140
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:02,004
Does anyone want to go out to meet them?

141
00:10:03,653 --> 00:10:07,600
If you keep hesitating and the company is sued and has to close down,

142
00:10:07,936 --> 00:10:09,600
you will be in trouble.

143
00:10:11,185 --> 00:10:14,200
This is not a problem that anyone can fix.

144
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:19,739
I vote for Tanya to be the new CEO.

145
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,705
For the future of Next.

146
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,900
I vote for you too.

147
00:10:23,034 --> 00:10:24,034
Me too.

148
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,020
Me too.

149
00:10:26,245 --> 00:10:27,245
Me too.

150
00:10:27,303 --> 00:10:28,044
Me too.

151
00:10:28,057 --> 00:10:28,979
Me too.

152
00:10:29,007 --> 00:10:30,007
Me too.

153
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,057
Hold on, everyone.

154
00:10:35,721 --> 00:10:36,721
What?

155
00:10:45,905 --> 00:10:48,091
Mr. Chanon and Mr. Veekit have arrived at the company.

156
00:10:48,103 --> 00:10:49,509
They are holding a press conference.

157
00:10:53,564 --> 00:10:55,805
Hello, I'm Chanon.

158
00:10:56,321 --> 00:10:57,321
I'm Veekit.

159
00:10:58,234 --> 00:11:03,342
Firstly, we would like to apologize

160
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:08,502
for the delayed compensation process.

161
00:11:09,343 --> 00:11:10,509
We are very sorry.

162
00:11:15,005 --> 00:11:18,903
We are contacting the users via a messaging service

163
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,339
right now.

164
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:25,779
The process is taking so long

165
00:11:26,011 --> 00:11:28,780
because we think this is a big problem.

166
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:37,050
We wanted to investigate what the cause of the problem was

167
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:39,188
and how it happened.

168
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,605
So we will not repeat the same mistake

169
00:11:40,874 --> 00:11:45,813
and offer suitable compensation to the users.

170
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:49,902
From our investigation,

171
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:55,137
we found that the data was not leaked due to the system error.

172
00:11:58,863 --> 00:12:02,937
It was actually a plan to sabotage me.

173
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,902
The person behind it was

174
00:12:10,368 --> 00:12:11,822
Miss Tanya Kanokkul.

175
00:12:12,192 --> 00:12:13,820
Miss Tanya?

176
00:12:14,011 --> 00:12:15,589
Miss Tanya, your new partner?

177
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:17,905
Was this a power struggle in the company?

178
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:21,776
The incident occurred when the company was under my management.

179
00:12:22,167 --> 00:12:23,705
Tanya is my friend.

180
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:26,413
She's an investor that I secured.

181
00:12:26,503 --> 00:12:29,594
Chanon, what are you doing?

182
00:12:29,607 --> 00:12:36,339
Miss Tanya did that so I could become the new CEO.

183
00:12:36,371 --> 00:12:39,407
Are you accusing Miss Tanya of the incident?

184
00:12:39,573 --> 00:12:40,779
Mr. Chanon, do you have evidence to prove it?

185
00:12:40,795 --> 00:12:43,422
Please reveal your evidence.

186
00:12:43,837 --> 00:12:47,205
The evidence has been sent to the police.

187
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:52,497
It's being sent to the company's executives as well via email.

188
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:56,906
It's revealed along with two witnesses.

189
00:12:57,825 --> 00:13:00,700
They are our programmers.

190
00:13:01,088 --> 00:13:03,708
They can provide evidence of a financial transaction

191
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:08,020
that they were hired by Tanya to leak the user data.

192
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,909
They have witnesses.

193
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:16,019
I insist that this problem was caused by the conflict in our company.

194
00:13:16,297 --> 00:13:24,007
Chanon and I will discuss with the executive board what we are going to do next.

195
00:13:24,029 --> 00:13:26,684
What if Miss Tanya denies your allegation?

196
00:13:26,777 --> 00:13:28,939
If that's what she chooses to do,

197
00:13:30,762 --> 00:13:33,017
she needs to deny it to the police.

198
00:13:33,917 --> 00:13:35,780
What will happen to Next?

199
00:13:35,788 --> 00:13:37,610
Is what they said true, Miss Tanya?

200
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:42,140
I would like to return the CEO position to Veekit.

201
00:13:45,285 --> 00:13:48,380
Because Next Innovation would have not existed

202
00:13:49,884 --> 00:13:51,016
without him.

203
00:13:58,570 --> 00:13:59,570
Wow.

204
00:13:59,841 --> 00:14:00,841
This is great.

205
00:14:01,986 --> 00:14:05,002
The two brothers have reconciled.

206
00:14:07,475 --> 00:14:08,475
Woo-hoo.

207
00:14:08,885 --> 00:14:09,885
Woo.

208
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:20,512
We will discuss this with the executive board again.

209
00:14:20,921 --> 00:14:26,499
The final decision will rest with the company's founder, Mr. Prapob.

210
00:14:27,162 --> 00:14:28,162
Thank you.

211
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:31,703
See.

212
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,309
I know my grandsons can do it.

213
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:39,299
From now on, we just watch them taking the company higher.

214
00:14:39,457 --> 00:14:42,407
Way to go, guys.

215
00:14:42,592 --> 00:14:44,702
You look so cool.

216
00:14:45,122 --> 00:14:46,700
I love it.

217
00:14:46,915 --> 00:14:47,607
Hello.

218
00:14:47,768 --> 00:14:49,370
Dad, you need to help me.

219
00:14:49,401 --> 00:14:50,401
(Quiet.)

220
00:14:50,831 --> 00:14:52,109
(Get out of there quietly.)

221
00:14:52,515 --> 00:14:54,917
(Don't let the reporters see you and answer their questions.)

222
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:56,808
Dad.

223
00:14:57,257 --> 00:14:59,334
Dad, please help me.

224
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:00,534
Dad.

225
00:15:00,565 --> 00:15:03,302
(Veekit and Chanon have offered you a way out.)

226
00:15:03,835 --> 00:15:05,302
(You need to listen to them.)

227
00:15:05,311 --> 00:15:07,737
(If the allegation is proven to be true, )

228
00:15:07,752 --> 00:15:09,737
(no one will want to do business with you.)

229
00:15:10,293 --> 00:15:13,013
(Admit your fault and back down.)

230
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:52,339
(The well-known app developer, Next Innovation, successfully overcame the crisis.)

231
00:15:52,405 --> 00:15:56,139
(It restored the existing users' confidence)

232
00:15:56,157 --> 00:15:59,964
(and also attracts new users.)

233
00:16:00,197 --> 00:16:03,737
(Both local and international investors keep tabs on the company.)

234
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,671
(They are looking for a chance to buy the company's shares.)

235
00:16:06,816 --> 00:16:10,722
(The company currently ranks first in terms of revenue.)

236
00:16:11,074 --> 00:16:12,776
Are you ready for the general meeting today?

237
00:16:13,694 --> 00:16:14,694
Of course.

238
00:16:14,854 --> 00:16:16,899
Today is Granddad's first day back to work.

239
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:18,407
We should celebrate.

240
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,736
He is too eager to come back to work after he has recovered.

241
00:16:22,204 --> 00:16:24,001
I don't get why he needs to hurry back to work.

242
00:16:25,714 --> 00:16:26,808
That's how a teenager is.

243
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:28,210
Teenager?

244
00:16:29,032 --> 00:16:30,032
Let's go.

245
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:40,850
Mr. Vee.

246
00:16:41,124 --> 00:16:43,217
Didn't you tell me that you would call me when you arrived?

247
00:16:43,488 --> 00:16:44,241
Right.

248
00:16:44,259 --> 00:16:46,219
You agreed to tell Mirin before you came up here, didn't you?

249
00:16:46,579 --> 00:16:48,105
I forgot.

250
00:16:48,278 --> 00:16:49,278
Sorry.

251
00:16:50,684 --> 00:16:51,825
What is behind you?

252
00:16:52,168 --> 00:16:53,168
What's it?

253
00:16:54,478 --> 00:16:55,644
It's not ready yet.

254
00:16:58,869 --> 00:17:00,142
What are they doing?

255
00:17:00,503 --> 00:17:01,903
Why are being so secretive?

256
00:17:02,386 --> 00:17:03,386
It's done.

257
00:17:03,853 --> 00:17:04,853
Okay.

258
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,891
Tada!

259
00:17:08,605 --> 00:17:09,496
Wow.

260
00:17:09,546 --> 00:17:10,657
Oh my god.

261
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:13,860
Did you make it, Girlfriend?

262
00:17:14,444 --> 00:17:15,232
Yes.

263
00:17:15,248 --> 00:17:18,108
Aew-aes came up with the idea and helped me arrange the cake.

264
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:21,373
This is to celebrate the one-month anniversary of you getting back to work together.

265
00:17:21,453 --> 00:17:23,105
Everything is going great.

266
00:17:23,315 --> 00:17:27,911
So we want to do a little thing for our bosses.

267
00:17:28,939 --> 00:17:30,000
Thank you.

268
00:17:30,871 --> 00:17:32,700
From its look, it must taste good.

269
00:17:33,447 --> 00:17:34,700
I'll cut a piece for you.

270
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,620
You should cut a piece for me first.

271
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:39,330
Okay.

272
00:17:40,589 --> 00:17:41,605
What is that?

273
00:17:44,376 --> 00:17:45,376
A cake.

274
00:17:46,417 --> 00:17:47,703
I can tell it's a cake.

275
00:17:48,022 --> 00:17:49,703
It surely doesn't look like a pie.

276
00:17:51,728 --> 00:17:53,702
It's orange and chocolate cake.

277
00:17:53,711 --> 00:17:54,942
It's my new recipe.

278
00:17:55,139 --> 00:17:57,240
It's sour and a bit bitter.

279
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,502
I guarantee that it tastes good.

280
00:17:59,205 --> 00:18:00,422
Where is my cake?

281
00:18:02,143 --> 00:18:04,100
You can take mine.

282
00:18:15,168 --> 00:18:16,937
It's quite good.

283
00:18:17,303 --> 00:18:20,026
But it will be better if it's less sweet.

284
00:18:20,693 --> 00:18:24,697
I think we should order a cake for the next meeting.

285
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:29,202
Serving sweets in the meeting will help reduce everyone's stress.

286
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:33,605
For Mr. Prapob, I want clean-eating desserts.

287
00:18:33,828 --> 00:18:34,828
Do you get it?

288
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:37,259
I'll prepare it with my heart.

289
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,214
I have the chocolate cake. It's my favorite.

290
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:51,422
Everything seems to going well.

291
00:18:52,296 --> 00:18:54,779
Thank you, my grandsons.

292
00:18:56,965 --> 00:18:57,979
If you don't mind,

293
00:18:58,591 --> 00:19:03,060
I would like to nominate the person I currently think is most suitable to be CEO.

294
00:19:03,764 --> 00:19:05,308
Before I make the nomination,

295
00:19:06,943 --> 00:19:08,099
I have a question to ask you.

296
00:19:09,456 --> 00:19:14,982
My grandsons, who do you think is suitable for the position?

297
00:19:19,488 --> 00:19:20,207
Good.

298
00:19:20,432 --> 00:19:21,659
It's good that it turns out this way.

299
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,211
I would like to announce

300
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,906
the person who is suitable to be the CEO

301
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:30,900
and knows Next well.

302
00:19:31,032 --> 00:19:34,297
I believe that this person can lead the company to a better future.

303
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:35,641
That person is...

304
00:19:37,413 --> 00:19:39,260
Sroyphet, my daughter.

305
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,582
Dad.

306
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:55,497
Please advise me, Aunt.

307
00:19:57,297 --> 00:19:59,659
I'm ready to follow your lead in everything.

308
00:20:02,085 --> 00:20:04,007
You are the most suitable person for the position.

309
00:20:04,631 --> 00:20:08,416
I'm sorry that I've overlooked you for a long time.

310
00:20:09,155 --> 00:20:14,405
I'll leave the company and my grandsons under your care.

311
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:57,960
Get used to the room.

312
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,453
This room is now yours.

313
00:21:01,965 --> 00:21:03,057
Thank you.

314
00:21:03,816 --> 00:21:06,201
When I suddenly fell ill and was hospitalized,

315
00:21:06,968 --> 00:21:10,600
I realized that I had many things that I wanted to do

316
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:15,105
and there were many people I needed to apologize.

317
00:21:19,035 --> 00:21:20,105
Neeraaumpan.

318
00:21:21,277 --> 00:21:23,509
I know this may upset you.

319
00:21:24,365 --> 00:21:25,502
But for me,

320
00:21:26,293 --> 00:21:27,900
she is a part of our family.

321
00:21:28,465 --> 00:21:30,600
She was the woman that your brother loved.

322
00:21:30,933 --> 00:21:32,208
She is Veekit's mother.

323
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,100
I want her to be a part of our family again.

324
00:21:43,275 --> 00:21:44,702
Of course.

325
00:21:45,854 --> 00:21:51,096
I also want to amend my wrongdoings.

326
00:21:52,491 --> 00:21:54,299
I need to apologize to her as well.

327
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,617
I'll talk to Veekit.

328
00:22:04,502 --> 00:22:06,303
Here, my boss.

329
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,097
Thank you, my secretary.

330
00:22:37,229 --> 00:22:38,405
What's wrong?

331
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:40,405
Stay still.

332
00:22:55,034 --> 00:22:57,604
I told you to stay still.

333
00:23:17,234 --> 00:23:20,109
I keep trying to read

334
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:27,259
What's in your heart but I must concede

335
00:23:49,339 --> 00:23:51,382
I have something to talk to Veekit.

336
00:23:52,413 --> 00:23:53,779
You can stay.

337
00:23:53,831 --> 00:23:54,979
It's not a big deal.

338
00:23:55,084 --> 00:23:56,605
It's okay.

339
00:23:56,837 --> 00:23:59,207
I'm about to go out to get a document.

340
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,505
Please have a seat.

341
00:24:17,819 --> 00:24:20,305
What do you want to talk to me about, Aunt Sroy?

342
00:24:22,088 --> 00:24:23,100
I...

343
00:24:24,007 --> 00:24:28,459
I want to apologize for everything I have done to you.

344
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:33,980
I'm not apologizing to you because you supported me in the board's meeting.

345
00:24:34,411 --> 00:24:35,703
The reason is

346
00:24:36,788 --> 00:24:39,202
when your grandfather felt ill, I was shocked.

347
00:24:39,401 --> 00:24:42,782
I realized that things would be better

348
00:24:43,751 --> 00:24:45,703
if I was a bigger person.

349
00:24:51,703 --> 00:24:53,179
Your grandfather hopes

350
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,302
Neeraaumpan will be a part of our family again.

351
00:25:00,943 --> 00:25:02,102
It's my wish as well.

352
00:25:03,626 --> 00:25:06,179
I'm not sure

353
00:25:08,118 --> 00:25:10,204
if you will give me a second chance.

354
00:25:14,699 --> 00:25:16,518
Right now,

355
00:25:18,035 --> 00:25:22,804
my mom lost most of her memory.

356
00:25:24,248 --> 00:25:26,179
I think it will be good for all of us

357
00:25:28,327 --> 00:25:30,407
to a fresh start.

358
00:25:34,589 --> 00:25:36,607
I'll take my mom to see you.

359
00:25:37,668 --> 00:25:38,668
Aunt.

360
00:25:41,934 --> 00:25:43,062
Thank you, Vee.

361
00:25:44,897 --> 00:25:47,100
Your grandfather will be happy to hear it.

362
00:25:50,275 --> 00:25:51,619
Thank you.

363
00:25:55,231 --> 00:25:57,106
It's lucky that things ended well.

364
00:25:57,189 --> 00:26:00,016
I was so worried when things were messy.

365
00:26:00,807 --> 00:26:05,340
Su, does this mean we can visit Veekit's mother?

366
00:26:05,487 --> 00:26:08,140
How is his mother doing?

367
00:26:09,755 --> 00:26:11,737
From what I heard from Mirin,

368
00:26:11,934 --> 00:26:14,320
she is physically healthy.

369
00:26:14,502 --> 00:26:16,757
But her disease is incurable.

370
00:26:16,917 --> 00:26:18,502
All we can do is provide palliative care.

371
00:26:18,794 --> 00:26:20,257
When we visit her,

372
00:26:20,265 --> 00:26:22,906
she probably won't remember us.

373
00:26:23,739 --> 00:26:26,423
We all forget things sometimes.

374
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,899
I don't mind if she doesn't remember me.

375
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,059
You are all here.

376
00:26:43,302 --> 00:26:43,970
Hello.

377
00:26:43,988 --> 00:26:45,136
Hello.

378
00:26:45,152 --> 00:26:46,545
Have you eaten anything?

379
00:26:46,565 --> 00:26:48,705
If not, you should stay and have dinner with us.

380
00:26:48,837 --> 00:26:50,856
You gave Mirin a ride home.

381
00:26:50,958 --> 00:26:51,958
Come here.

382
00:26:52,462 --> 00:26:53,035
Yes?

383
00:26:53,041 --> 00:26:54,105
Come here.

384
00:26:57,035 --> 00:26:58,035
What do you want to say?

385
00:26:58,847 --> 00:27:01,801
About the new application that we are working on together,

386
00:27:01,822 --> 00:27:03,031
give me some updates.

387
00:27:03,048 --> 00:27:05,062
I think it will turn out great.

388
00:27:05,348 --> 00:27:06,906
I'm testing the new system.

389
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:09,054
I'll prepare a presentation for you.

390
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,591
I'm excited.

391
00:27:11,764 --> 00:27:13,005
Swing your arms.

392
00:27:13,186 --> 00:27:13,680
Like this.

393
00:27:13,694 --> 00:27:14,711
Keep it going.

394
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,120
Your arms are so long.

395
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,105
Try this. It's delicious.

396
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,514
Try this. It's tastier.

397
00:27:29,525 --> 00:27:31,305
I did my best to cook it.

398
00:27:32,174 --> 00:27:33,208
Try this, too.

399
00:27:34,428 --> 00:27:35,428
Thank you.

400
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:40,582
I'm not going to spoon out the food for you.

401
00:27:41,274 --> 00:27:42,274
I know that.

402
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,040
When are you two going to get married?

403
00:27:55,054 --> 00:27:56,262
Noi.

404
00:27:56,528 --> 00:27:57,528
Aunt Noi.

405
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:01,709
I'm just asking.

406
00:28:01,868 --> 00:28:05,302
I saw that his new application has been completed.

407
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:08,908
So it may be time for them to get married.

408
00:28:09,013 --> 00:28:10,708
That's enough, Aunt Noi.

409
00:28:10,718 --> 00:28:12,136
We want to focus on our work first.

410
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:14,660
There's one more thing.

411
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:21,875
Please tell Chanon that I still want to invest with him if he wants it.

412
00:28:23,315 --> 00:28:25,254
He will be glad to hear it.

413
00:28:25,345 --> 00:28:26,462
That's enough.

414
00:28:26,783 --> 00:28:27,862
Now, it's dinner time.

415
00:28:27,874 --> 00:28:29,802
You should put your work aside.

416
00:28:30,262 --> 00:28:31,262
Veekit.

417
00:28:31,902 --> 00:28:33,291
Next time when you come here,

418
00:28:33,309 --> 00:28:34,494
take your mom with you.

419
00:28:35,874 --> 00:28:36,874
Sure.

420
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,808
What are you thinking?

421
00:28:54,971 --> 00:28:56,850
I'm thinking about what Big Noi said earlier.

422
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,457
About the investment with Mr. Chanon, right?

423
00:28:59,468 --> 00:29:00,134
I think...

424
00:29:00,142 --> 00:29:01,542
No, not about that.

425
00:29:02,097 --> 00:29:03,579
You really don't know my mind.

426
00:29:05,813 --> 00:29:07,511
I'm thinking about our wedding.

427
00:29:09,016 --> 00:29:11,260
Mr. Vee, you don't need to think about it.

428
00:29:11,336 --> 00:29:13,463
Now, you should focus on the company.

429
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:16,863
I think this way we will have time to save up money.

430
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,906
Because I am very pricey.

431
00:29:19,431 --> 00:29:20,912
Is that so? Okay.

432
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:22,148
Miss Jewel in the Crown.

433
00:29:22,171 --> 00:29:23,605
Miss Gold Bullion.

434
00:29:27,041 --> 00:29:28,608
But I can't put it off for long.

435
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:31,195
I want to marry you.

436
00:29:35,244 --> 00:29:36,499
Look at me.

437
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,829
Mr. Vee, get in the car.

438
00:29:40,834 --> 00:29:42,105
Hurry.

439
00:29:42,118 --> 00:29:43,337
Get in the car.

440
00:29:43,585 --> 00:29:44,405
Go.

441
00:29:44,542 --> 00:29:45,484
You don't need to be shy.

442
00:29:45,493 --> 00:29:46,438
I'm not.

443
00:29:46,448 --> 00:29:47,223
Go.

444
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:48,802
Get in the car and drive safe.

445
00:29:53,248 --> 00:29:54,305
Bye.

446
00:29:54,548 --> 00:29:55,548
Bye.

447
00:30:12,103 --> 00:30:13,136
What?

448
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:17,614
I'm happy that my granddaughter is getting married.

449
00:30:18,111 --> 00:30:19,678
What marry?

450
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:20,899
I need to make a lot of money first.

451
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:22,937
When I am rich, I'll take you on vacations.

452
00:30:23,657 --> 00:30:25,100
You don't need to do that.

453
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:30,200
For us, seeing you happy is good enough.

454
00:30:30,718 --> 00:30:31,948
You've done well.

455
00:30:31,958 --> 00:30:35,057
For everything that you've been through, you did well.

456
00:30:35,077 --> 00:30:37,008
I remember something.

457
00:30:37,256 --> 00:30:40,454
It must be the dress that I bought her.

458
00:30:41,211 --> 00:30:44,411
I told you that I would bring you good luck.

459
00:30:44,958 --> 00:30:47,586
You got a good job and a great man.

460
00:30:47,668 --> 00:30:50,108
Mom, how can you say that?

461
00:30:50,717 --> 00:30:51,717
But she is right.

462
00:30:51,758 --> 00:30:52,823
Mom!

463
00:30:54,331 --> 00:30:55,801
Let's hug.

464
00:31:08,448 --> 00:31:09,448
Mom.

465
00:31:14,438 --> 00:31:16,422
Vee, you are home.

466
00:31:19,918 --> 00:31:20,918
I'm home.

467
00:31:22,677 --> 00:31:25,198
You remember me today.

468
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:26,909
That's great.

469
00:31:28,438 --> 00:31:30,306
How is your day?

470
00:31:31,026 --> 00:31:32,026
I...

471
00:31:33,202 --> 00:31:34,779
I ate a lot today.

472
00:31:37,682 --> 00:31:38,682
That's great.

473
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,940
Mom.

474
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:50,407
Can you go with me tomorrow?

475
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:53,016
Someone wants to see you.

476
00:31:54,931 --> 00:31:58,832
You will be safe because I'm going with you.

477
00:32:12,637 --> 00:32:14,099
Mom, do you remember this place?

478
00:32:25,226 --> 00:32:26,306
You are here.

479
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,540
Hello, Aunt Sroy.

480
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,103
Come on. Let's go in.

481
00:32:42,237 --> 00:32:43,297
Dad is waiting for you.

482
00:32:45,936 --> 00:32:46,936
Mom, let's go.

483
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,414
I'm going with you.

484
00:33:04,428 --> 00:33:06,300
Mom, sit here.

485
00:33:13,237 --> 00:33:14,660
Dad will be here soon.

486
00:33:14,794 --> 00:33:15,862
Wait here.

487
00:33:16,023 --> 00:33:17,302
I'll go get you a drink.

488
00:33:18,795 --> 00:33:19,801
Thank you.

489
00:33:25,217 --> 00:33:27,620
Mom, I'll go see Non.

490
00:33:27,868 --> 00:33:30,982
Can you wait here?

491
00:33:43,967 --> 00:33:44,967
Miss.

492
00:33:45,598 --> 00:33:47,207
Miss, are you okay?

493
00:33:47,216 --> 00:33:48,216
I'm okay.

494
00:33:48,416 --> 00:33:49,065
I'm okay.

495
00:33:49,071 --> 00:33:49,826
Can you get up?

496
00:33:49,832 --> 00:33:51,020
I'll help you pick them up.

497
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:52,220
I can do it.

498
00:33:54,189 --> 00:33:55,210
Are you okay?

499
00:34:10,042 --> 00:34:12,037
Let me help you.

500
00:34:15,102 --> 00:34:16,508
You are all wet.

501
00:34:17,161 --> 00:34:18,401
Thank you.

502
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,210
I'm sorry, Neeraaumpan.

503
00:34:28,422 --> 00:34:29,805
You just spilled my water.

504
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:32,508
You don't need to apologize to me.

505
00:34:41,149 --> 00:34:43,017
It's not about the water.

506
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:44,714
I...

507
00:34:48,817 --> 00:34:49,976
I'm sorry

508
00:34:51,114 --> 00:34:55,976
for everything that I've done to you.

509
00:34:57,075 --> 00:35:01,905
I hope that you will forgive me one day.

510
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:10,315
I don't remember any of them.

511
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:16,260
But I forgive you.

512
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:23,380
You seem to be very caring and welcoming to me.

513
00:35:28,917 --> 00:35:30,460
Let's end our feud here.

514
00:35:41,103 --> 00:35:42,980
Your necklace is beautiful.

515
00:35:45,848 --> 00:35:48,915
Can I call you Sroy?

516
00:35:52,185 --> 00:35:53,903
You are here.

517
00:35:58,614 --> 00:35:59,614
Dad.

518
00:36:03,585 --> 00:36:05,300
Hello, Neeraaumpan.

519
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:08,414
I'm Prapob, your husband's father.

520
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:10,460
He's Veekit's grandfather.

521
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:12,001
Let's have a meal together.

522
00:36:12,016 --> 00:36:13,016
Are you hungry?

523
00:36:16,161 --> 00:36:17,777
Let's go. I'll help you carry it.

524
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,619
Be careful.

525
00:36:35,096 --> 00:36:36,434
You don't need to greet me anymore.

526
00:36:36,459 --> 00:36:38,807
You've done that three times already.

527
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:43,869
Vee.

528
00:36:45,762 --> 00:36:50,308
Your grandma gave this pin to your father.

529
00:36:50,884 --> 00:36:53,697
It's a set with the ring that your mom is wearing.

530
00:36:54,909 --> 00:36:57,160
Your mom always wore it.

531
00:36:58,282 --> 00:37:01,017
Until the day she had a fight with me.

532
00:37:02,131 --> 00:37:06,908
I'll take this chance to return the pin to your mom.

533
00:37:20,709 --> 00:37:22,174
It's pretty, Sroy.

534
00:37:24,804 --> 00:37:26,460
Thank you so much, Aunt Sroy.

535
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:31,514
Mom.

536
00:37:32,979 --> 00:37:36,017
I have a favor to ask you.

537
00:37:46,758 --> 00:37:50,377
Why did you take me here?

538
00:37:55,958 --> 00:37:56,958
This place.

539
00:37:58,321 --> 00:38:01,010
I have a lot of memories here.

540
00:38:03,105 --> 00:38:04,705
The day my mom went missing.

541
00:38:06,434 --> 00:38:07,976
The day that I met you.

542
00:38:11,459 --> 00:38:15,605
It's the place where I became blind

543
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:23,897
and also the place where I can see the best thing in my life, that is you.

544
00:38:28,702 --> 00:38:30,340
Mirin, thank you so much

545
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:34,413
for making me see things again

546
00:38:35,616 --> 00:38:37,099
with my eyes

547
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:39,939
and my heart.

548
00:38:43,506 --> 00:38:44,740
Why are you saying these things?

549
00:38:45,368 --> 00:38:46,802
I'm shy.

550
00:38:48,244 --> 00:38:52,619
I hope that I won't get hurt again at this place.

551
00:38:54,678 --> 00:38:56,220
Don't say that.

552
00:38:57,207 --> 00:38:58,939
What else can hurt you now?

553
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:01,337
You have everything.

554
00:39:03,739 --> 00:39:04,739
No.

555
00:39:05,456 --> 00:39:06,456
Not everything.

556
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,080
Come here.

557
00:39:14,822 --> 00:39:16,317
Which carousel horse do you want to ride on?

558
00:39:16,911 --> 00:39:19,299
But it's closed.

559
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:32,216
Do you really need to do this?

560
00:39:32,331 --> 00:39:33,331
Come on.

561
00:39:33,478 --> 00:39:34,619
Let's ride the merry-go-round.

562
00:39:36,718 --> 00:39:37,008
Hurry.

563
00:39:37,016 --> 00:39:38,742
Okay, Mr. Vee.

564
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,808
Which one do you want to ride on?

565
00:39:44,918 --> 00:39:46,109
Hurry, pick one.

566
00:39:53,894 --> 00:39:55,100
It doesn't look nice.

567
00:39:55,478 --> 00:39:56,478
What?

568
00:40:12,586 --> 00:40:14,502
If you accept this ring,

569
00:40:16,364 --> 00:40:20,808
even though the carousel horse that you pick is ugly

570
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:24,617
I will ride it with you.

571
00:40:26,278 --> 00:40:27,805
Whatever you want to do,

572
00:40:28,294 --> 00:40:30,308
I'll do it with you.

573
00:40:33,811 --> 00:40:35,657
Wherever you go,

574
00:40:38,349 --> 00:40:40,459
I'll go with you.

575
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,202
In simple words, I'll do everything you tell me to do.

576
00:40:46,992 --> 00:40:48,308
What if I don't accept the ring?

577
00:40:52,922 --> 00:40:54,011
What if you don't accept the ring?

578
00:40:58,177 --> 00:40:59,817
Then you have to do everything that I tell you to do.

579
00:41:02,108 --> 00:41:05,102
Does this mean whether I accept the ring or not

580
00:41:06,182 --> 00:41:08,222
I will still have you in my life?

581
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:13,830
Yes.

582
00:41:17,115 --> 00:41:18,500
Is this...

583
00:41:20,057 --> 00:41:21,980
an engagement ring?

584
00:41:24,228 --> 00:41:26,016
Yes.

585
00:41:27,223 --> 00:41:29,302
Do I need to say it out loud?

586
00:41:32,085 --> 00:41:33,085
Yes.

587
00:41:37,955 --> 00:41:39,459
You need to say it out loud.

588
00:41:40,031 --> 00:41:41,208
It's important to me.

589
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:45,911
Okay.

590
00:41:46,013 --> 00:41:47,013
Okay.

591
00:42:00,567 --> 00:42:01,998
Marry me.

592
00:42:04,192 --> 00:42:05,404
Wait.

593
00:42:05,478 --> 00:42:06,478
Wait a second.

594
00:42:12,475 --> 00:42:13,939
Would you marry me?

595
00:42:20,222 --> 00:42:21,222
That's all.

596
00:42:21,728 --> 00:42:27,102
Sometimes it seems we're in sync

597
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:32,005
Your heart to mine, there's a link

598
00:42:32,177 --> 00:42:32,354
If you cut to the chase, it would have been done a long time ago.

599
00:42:32,355 --> 00:42:34,376
But other times it seems you're so distant
If you cut to the chase, it would have been done a long time ago.

600
00:42:34,377 --> 00:42:36,382
But other times it seems you're so distant

601
00:42:36,383 --> 00:42:37,407
So what is your answer?
But other times it seems you're so distant

602
00:42:37,408 --> 00:42:37,423
So what is your answer?

603
00:42:37,424 --> 00:42:38,047
We are so different
So what is your answer?

604
00:42:38,047 --> 00:42:38,057
We are so different

605
00:42:38,058 --> 00:42:40,739
I've already said it, Miss Ceremonialist.
We are so different

606
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:41,740
We are so different

607
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,002
The notebook that you carry around with you.

608
00:42:46,081 --> 00:42:47,939
The one that you jotted down the hot chocolate recipe.

609
00:42:48,377 --> 00:42:50,662
You never looked at other pages, did you?

610
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:53,970
Notebook?

611
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:08,708
It leaves me in a daze

612
00:43:08,952 --> 00:43:09,597
To Mr. Veekit.

613
00:43:09,597 --> 00:43:10,142
Can't tell if it's you through the haze
To Mr. Veekit.

614
00:43:10,143 --> 00:43:13,437
Can't tell if it's you through the haze

615
00:43:13,438 --> 00:43:13,442
Whenever you want me to be by your side,
Can't tell if it's you through the haze

616
00:43:13,443 --> 00:43:13,989
Whenever you want me to be by your side,

617
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:16,212
Is it you who will come around
Whenever you want me to be by your side,

618
00:43:16,213 --> 00:43:16,226
Whenever you want me to be by your side,

619
00:43:16,227 --> 00:43:16,410
And turn my whole world upside down
Whenever you want me to be by your side,

620
00:43:16,411 --> 00:43:17,926
And turn my whole world upside down

621
00:43:17,927 --> 00:43:19,622
I'll be there for you.
And turn my whole world upside down

622
00:43:19,623 --> 00:43:22,019
And turn my whole world upside down

623
00:43:23,278 --> 00:43:27,407
My love will shine onto you

624
00:43:27,582 --> 00:43:29,903
no matter how far away you are from me.

625
00:43:32,829 --> 00:43:35,410
I know that nothing can come between us

626
00:43:36,826 --> 00:43:38,905
as long as you don't stop loving me.

627
00:43:40,404 --> 00:43:41,908
My heart

628
00:43:42,804 --> 00:43:44,737
will always be yours.

629
00:43:46,822 --> 00:43:49,980
Rich man, poor woman.

630
00:43:53,921 --> 00:43:54,921
Yes, I do.

631
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:01,860
Okay.

632
00:44:18,312 --> 00:44:19,903
This is the ring

633
00:44:20,674 --> 00:44:22,305
that my dad gave to my mom.

634
00:44:23,391 --> 00:44:25,020
I'm asking her to give it to me.

635
00:44:26,191 --> 00:44:27,191
How is it?

636
00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:28,850
Do you like it?

637
00:44:31,045 --> 00:44:32,045
Yes.

638
00:44:34,333 --> 00:44:39,020
Can we hold the wedding at the merry-go-round?

639
00:44:46,682 --> 00:44:47,682
Sure.

640
00:44:55,625 --> 00:45:00,737
I can look but I just can't see

641
00:45:01,045 --> 00:45:03,299
Your true feelings for me

642
00:45:03,306 --> 00:45:05,890
Hidden like a mystery

643
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:06,397
From now on,

644
00:45:06,397 --> 00:45:07,032
Won't you please just tell me?
From now on,

645
00:45:07,032 --> 00:45:07,039
Won't you please just tell me?

646
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,653
Every night when I go to sleep,
Won't you please just tell me?

647
00:45:08,654 --> 00:45:08,660
Won't you please just tell me?

648
00:45:08,661 --> 00:45:11,336
You will be the last person I see.
Won't you please just tell me?

649
00:45:11,337 --> 00:45:11,340
Won't you please just tell me?

650
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:11,949
The first person I see the next morning
Won't you please just tell me?

651
00:45:11,949 --> 00:45:12,497
The first person I see the next morning

652
00:45:12,498 --> 00:45:14,433
What could our relationship be?
The first person I see the next morning

653
00:45:14,434 --> 00:45:14,442
What could our relationship be?

654
00:45:14,443 --> 00:45:15,610
Will also be you.
What could our relationship be?

655
00:45:15,611 --> 00:45:16,980
What could our relationship be?

656
00:45:16,998 --> 00:45:17,558
Roger that, Mr. Veekit.

657
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:18,738
Please help me truly see
Roger that, Mr. Veekit.

658
00:45:18,739 --> 00:45:22,333
Please help me truly see

659
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:25,685
You're my true love for eternity

Directed by Ekkasit Trakulkasemsuk and Pantip Vibultham

661
00:45:31,885 --> 00:45:34,339
Do what my mom orders.

662
00:45:34,928 --> 00:45:36,312
Sure, I'll take care of it.

663
00:45:39,066 --> 00:45:42,739
If you have nothing else, why don't we go have dinner with Big Noi today?

664
00:45:43,216 --> 00:45:45,248
I can't.

665
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:47,602
I have an interview to find my new secretary.

666
00:45:47,882 --> 00:45:49,579
Aew-aes got a promotion.

667
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,616
You still can't find a secretary that you like.

668
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:54,708
I think you have interviewed every job seeker in the country.

669
00:46:00,453 --> 00:46:01,045
I'm sorry.

670
00:46:01,056 --> 00:46:03,219
Miss Aew-aes told me to come in.

671
00:46:03,957 --> 00:46:05,302
Yes, come in.

672
00:46:10,706 --> 00:46:11,906
Please introduce yourself.

673
00:46:12,325 --> 00:46:13,325
Sroyphet.

674
00:46:13,699 --> 00:46:15,004
My name is Sroyphet.

675
00:46:19,188 --> 00:46:20,402
Did you recruit her?

676
00:46:21,453 --> 00:46:22,808
No.

677
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,669
I didn't recruit her.

678
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:25,700
I swear.

679
00:46:26,143 --> 00:46:27,143
Wait.

680
00:46:27,499 --> 00:46:29,706
Is that creally your name?

681
00:46:31,771 --> 00:46:32,771
Yes.

682
00:46:32,857 --> 00:46:34,202
My mom's name is Sroy.

683
00:46:34,328 --> 00:46:35,051
My dad's name is Phet.

684
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:36,946
So they named me Sroyphet.

685
00:46:45,982 --> 00:46:48,512
I think you are likely to get the job.
