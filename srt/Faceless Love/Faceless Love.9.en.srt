1
00:00:00,336 --> 00:00:02,084
Whatever the truth is,

2
00:00:02,749 --> 00:00:04,084
I don't want to hear it.

3
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:05,983
I don't want to lose you again.

4
00:00:06,553 --> 00:00:10,783
This woman is Neeraaumpan.

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,330
Veekit's mother who has been missing.

6
00:00:13,904 --> 00:00:15,141
Hello, Tanya.

7
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:18,060
I know when we are going to use those photos.

8
00:00:18,336 --> 00:00:21,661
Next, please welcome Mr. Veekit Kraipiwat.

9
00:00:21,838 --> 00:00:23,580
I'm Chanon Kanchanarak.

10
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm here on behalf of Mr. Veekit who has an emergency errand.

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,460
Tell me the truth.

12
00:00:33,156 --> 00:00:36,061
The woman sitting next to you was my mom, wasn't she?

13
00:00:57,258 --> 00:00:58,664
Hello, all.

14
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:01,966
Please welcome Mr. Veekit Kraipiwat.

15
00:01:44,253 --> 00:01:45,309
Hello.

16
00:01:46,027 --> 00:01:47,813
I'm Chanon Kanchanarak.

17
00:01:48,586 --> 00:01:50,107
I'm here on behalf of Mr. Veekit

18
00:01:50,112 --> 00:01:52,903
who is currently sorting out an important matter.

19
00:01:53,045 --> 00:01:57,047
I will gladly walk you through

20
00:01:57,072 --> 00:02:00,307
all the interesting applications we're developing here at Next Innovation.

21
00:02:31,821 --> 00:02:33,010
Mr. Vee...

22
00:02:47,764 --> 00:02:48,860
Who is that with you?

23
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:54,312
I can't see the faces,

24
00:02:54,972 --> 00:02:58,313
but I do remember that that's your shirt.

25
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,003
That's your handbag.

26
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,456
That's your hair!

27
00:03:03,478 --> 00:03:06,181
That's my mother sitting with you, isn't it?

28
00:03:10,893 --> 00:03:12,176
Answer me!

29
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:18,701
Yes.

30
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:36,700
15-20% of Thai people

31
00:03:37,413 --> 00:03:42,335
know friends, acquaintances, or family members

32
00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:44,000
who suffer from depression.

33
00:03:48,121 --> 00:03:54,340
(This is a sad fact, but also a great opportunity, for Next Innovation.)

34
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:58,603
Mr. Vee.

35
00:03:59,229 --> 00:04:01,218
Please, let me explain.

36
00:04:01,238 --> 00:04:05,104
You changed your name to Neeraaumpan

37
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,403
just to get me to hire you.

38
00:04:23,312 --> 00:04:25,698
You're the only woman in the whole world

39
00:04:26,436 --> 00:04:29,006
who could make me feel so stupid!

40
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:33,201
Get out!

41
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,707
Mr. Vee.

42
00:04:42,052 --> 00:04:43,133
Go, Mirin.

43
00:04:43,152 --> 00:04:47,900
Don't use poverty as an excuse for doing such a horrible thing.

44
00:04:48,632 --> 00:04:52,500
That was all the innovations that Next Innovation has to offer.

45
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,364
How are things with Veekit?

46
00:05:34,983 --> 00:05:36,178
Everything's taken care of.

47
00:05:36,789 --> 00:05:38,580
Mr. Chanon, that was splendid.

48
00:05:38,832 --> 00:05:39,612
Thank you.

49
00:05:39,627 --> 00:05:40,704
This is my card.

50
00:05:43,683 --> 00:05:45,503
I'd love to work with you.

Aew-eas.

59
00:07:24,624 --> 00:07:25,809
Yes, Mr. Prapob?

60
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,740
Where are Veekit and Mirin?

61
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,538
Uhh... I don't know.

62
00:07:34,953 --> 00:07:37,898
I saw them around the stage minutes ago.

63
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:41,155
Maybe they had some quarrel—

64
00:07:41,163 --> 00:07:42,307
What do you mean, quarrel?

65
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:43,844
Uhh...

66
00:07:43,858 --> 00:07:48,001
It seems Veekit is dating his secretary, Dad.

67
00:07:51,093 --> 00:07:55,003
They hold hands all merrily even right before my eyes

68
00:07:55,343 --> 00:07:57,607
with no regards to propriety, no less.

69
00:07:59,053 --> 00:08:02,216
Your golden boy sure is open, I'll give him that.

70
00:08:04,292 --> 00:08:05,803
I have no qualms about who he's dating.

71
00:08:06,758 --> 00:08:08,863
But I can't accept that he's letting it affect work.

72
00:08:12,206 --> 00:08:14,860
I guess you will have to talk to him, Dad.

73
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:18,461
You know he's never listened to me since way back.

74
00:08:22,561 --> 00:08:23,703
Excuse me.

75
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:36,810
Do not let my father find out about Neeraaumpan.

76
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:37,903
Yes.

77
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,104
Mirin.

78
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:56,572
Mirin?

79
00:08:56,581 --> 00:08:57,803
What's wrong, baby?

80
00:08:58,641 --> 00:08:59,590
What happened?

81
00:08:59,603 --> 00:09:00,284
Rin.

82
00:09:00,672 --> 00:09:01,460
Mom...

83
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,703
- What's the matter? - Rin.

84
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,261
Did–Did he find out?

85
00:09:10,513 --> 00:09:11,604
Yes.

86
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:16,023
I was going to tell him on Sunday, but...

87
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,309
What are you talking about?

88
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,510
That woman we helped long ago.

89
00:09:22,966 --> 00:09:24,330
She's Veekit's mother.

90
00:09:25,984 --> 00:09:27,616
You mean the lady at the church?

91
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:34,612
Rin borrowed her name to get the job.

92
00:09:39,449 --> 00:09:41,703
I just wanted a job, Grandma.

93
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,512
I didn't want to disappoint you two.

94
00:09:49,244 --> 00:09:51,261
The fault was in your intention, baby.

95
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:56,658
You used his mother's name to get his attention just to get hired.

96
00:09:57,156 --> 00:09:59,712
But it's not like she's robbing him or anything.

97
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:03,613
He gets a great employee in return, doesn't he?

98
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:07,206
If she's just an employee, then by all means, it should be fine.

99
00:10:07,993 --> 00:10:09,100
But...

100
00:10:10,178 --> 00:10:12,004
They fell in love.

101
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,203
What?

102
00:10:15,053 --> 00:10:17,661
He must despise me so much right now

103
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,313
that I never brought up his mother,

104
00:10:21,652 --> 00:10:24,420
especially when I know he's been looking for her.

105
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,223
What could you have done, dear?

106
00:10:27,235 --> 00:10:30,143
It was his mother who made you promise to keep this a secret.

107
00:10:30,384 --> 00:10:31,336
That's true.

108
00:10:31,555 --> 00:10:34,196
Not to mention that she's been a burden to us for years.

109
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:36,020
She's not even family.

110
00:10:36,423 --> 00:10:38,303
How much will you coddle your granddaughter?

111
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:40,423
Think about what that boy's going through.

112
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:42,204
He was completely fooled.

113
00:10:42,327 --> 00:10:44,904
It doesn't matter what the reason is, it won't make him feel any better.

114
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:54,713
I'm busy.

115
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,613
Tanya, I am not in the mood to—

116
00:11:11,623 --> 00:11:12,900
Don't bother.

117
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,616
I just want to talk.

118
00:11:36,324 --> 00:11:37,307
Where's Mirin?

119
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,000
Please, come in.

120
00:12:10,732 --> 00:12:11,603
Grandpa.

121
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:13,273
Don't worry.

122
00:12:14,273 --> 00:12:15,707
I'm just here to talk to you.

123
00:12:17,367 --> 00:12:18,206
Let me.

124
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:30,940
Good job today.

125
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,204
You showed me Next Innovation from a new angle.

126
00:12:50,156 --> 00:12:51,107
Where are you going?

127
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,581
What's your problem with me?

128
00:12:55,912 --> 00:12:58,570
She's been fooling you about your mother all this time,

129
00:12:59,566 --> 00:13:01,109
and you even fell for her.

130
00:13:01,675 --> 00:13:05,401
But you can't even stand being in the same room with me for a minute?

131
00:13:07,924 --> 00:13:11,409
How did you know about Mirin and my mother?

132
00:13:20,643 --> 00:13:23,381
Well, the photos are all over the floor, aren't they?

133
00:13:23,795 --> 00:13:25,781
I've seen a photo of your mother before.

134
00:13:26,287 --> 00:13:27,604
I recognize her.

135
00:13:30,092 --> 00:13:32,607
And it's not like it's hard to connect the dots, Veekit.

136
00:13:33,249 --> 00:13:35,207
Your mother has been missing for years,

137
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:39,538
and suddenly someone showed up for a job with your mother's name.

138
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:43,136
Anyone would be able to tell she planned to use you.

139
00:13:45,984 --> 00:13:47,001
Amazing.

140
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,136
Aren't you a genius, Tanya?

141
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:50,609
Congratulations.

142
00:13:50,804 --> 00:13:51,909
Now...

143
00:13:52,584 --> 00:13:53,940
Can you leave me alone?

144
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:55,615
Again?

145
00:13:55,947 --> 00:13:57,541
You're pushing me off again?

146
00:13:57,629 --> 00:13:58,735
You know what?

147
00:13:59,753 --> 00:14:01,504
Your reputation is ruined.

148
00:14:02,315 --> 00:14:04,107
You're thoroughly finished,

149
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,936
while Chanon just scored points with everyone.

150
00:14:07,707 --> 00:14:08,610
And?

151
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:17,736
If you'd been nice to me just a little, I might help you.

152
00:14:27,841 --> 00:14:29,301
I don't care

153
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:33,910
what became of my reputation or who did better than me today.

154
00:14:36,564 --> 00:14:38,535
I'll have you know one thing,

155
00:14:38,564 --> 00:14:42,518
even now that Mirin's become someone who's lied to me

156
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,007
or destroyed me,

157
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,338
I will never love you, Tanya.

158
00:14:58,876 --> 00:15:00,030
That is why...

159
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,906
I don't need your help.

160
00:15:04,526 --> 00:15:06,941
I don't need your sympathy or anything.

161
00:15:09,881 --> 00:15:12,944
Because if you even care about my feelings right now,

162
00:15:13,692 --> 00:15:18,512
you'll know that this is not the right time to talk to me.

163
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,707
Please.

164
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:23,860
Get out.

165
00:15:45,275 --> 00:15:48,407
You showed me the part of Next Innovation...

166
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,400
that I might have overlooked.

167
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,738
But whatever it is,

168
00:15:55,983 --> 00:16:00,106
Next Innovation can't go on without Veekit.

169
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:08,407
It's not because I love one grandchild more than the other.

170
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:11,918
It's not because you're not good enough.

171
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:18,740
But Next Innovation needs both

172
00:16:19,704 --> 00:16:24,707
Chanon Kanchanarak and Veekit Kraipiwat.

173
00:16:28,798 --> 00:16:32,112
Why didn't you look after Veekit today?

174
00:16:35,335 --> 00:16:39,701
Why did you let him miss the presentation?

175
00:16:43,106 --> 00:16:44,012
Grandpa.

176
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:45,696
I've been telling you all this time.

177
00:16:48,326 --> 00:16:49,710
You're the big brother here, Non.

178
00:16:50,247 --> 00:16:53,806
You have to take care of your cousin and the company.

179
00:16:59,987 --> 00:17:02,704
Veekit is no longer a 10-year-old kid.

180
00:17:06,003 --> 00:17:09,701
And I am an adult who wants to spread his own wings.

181
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:13,101
Everyone has to take care of themselves.

182
00:17:14,126 --> 00:17:15,500
That includes Veekit.

183
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,710
He's the CEO.

184
00:17:20,053 --> 00:17:23,715
If he keeps failing to distinguish when not to do something,

185
00:17:24,212 --> 00:17:26,303
will Next be alright under his control?

186
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,501
Chanon.

187
00:17:27,535 --> 00:17:29,021
Did I say something wrong?

188
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:32,101
Just because I'm not suffering from a face-blinding condition,

189
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,720
does it mean I have no right to even think for myself?

190
00:17:45,618 --> 00:17:48,003
You should go get a checkup, too, Grandpa.

191
00:17:48,626 --> 00:17:50,650
Maybe you also have some kind of blindness.

192
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,006
Maybe that's why you haven't been able to see me for years.

193
00:17:54,961 --> 00:17:57,340
Veekit was born later than I was,

194
00:17:59,949 --> 00:18:03,706
but you've only been his "Granddad" instead of my "Grandpa" ever since.

195
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:10,013
Do you even realize that you've been doing that all this time?

196
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:39,807
Rin.

197
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:41,980
Let me ask you something.

198
00:18:42,773 --> 00:18:44,616
Where did all those photos come from?

199
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,304
I don't know.

200
00:18:48,918 --> 00:18:51,661
I don't know how those people found out where Aunt Nee is.

201
00:18:53,178 --> 00:18:54,503
Those people?

202
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:59,458
I think they're Mrs. Sroyphet's men.

203
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:07,007
Rin, then we need to tell Nee that she's been found.

204
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:09,929
You're right.

205
00:19:34,116 --> 00:19:37,103
Should I congratulate you on your upcoming promotion right here and now?

206
00:19:40,443 --> 00:19:45,407
Not when Prapob came into my office reminding me

207
00:19:47,121 --> 00:19:53,303
how Next Innovation needs both Chanon and Veekit.

208
00:19:56,776 --> 00:19:58,507
Well, mine went something like,

209
00:19:58,935 --> 00:20:03,703
"Even when Mirin's lied to or destroyed me,

210
00:20:05,758 --> 00:20:07,507
I will never love you."

211
00:20:11,876 --> 00:20:12,609
Cheers.

212
00:20:20,758 --> 00:20:22,100
What a nuisance.

213
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:23,606
True.

214
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,696
What a damn nuisance.

215
00:20:26,207 --> 00:20:29,460
Doesn't Veekit realize what Mirin did was wrong?

216
00:20:30,401 --> 00:20:34,740
It's so wrong that he shouldn't even want to look at her face again.

217
00:20:35,215 --> 00:20:37,503
I didn't think Mirin actually knew Aunt Nee.

218
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,707
That complicated everything.

219
00:20:45,741 --> 00:20:47,406
What should we do now?

220
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,303
About what?

221
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:51,610
Everything.

222
00:20:52,116 --> 00:20:55,903
I want to know what you think, both about work and Mirin.

223
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,004
And there's also Neeraaumpan.

224
00:21:03,793 --> 00:21:06,920
If Grandpa finds out Aunt Nee is alive,

225
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,509
the table could turn again.

226
00:21:10,032 --> 00:21:12,301
And it surely won't be in our favor.

227
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,818
Then what should we do now?

228
00:21:22,373 --> 00:21:24,981
I feel like there's a way to tie all these problems together

229
00:21:26,155 --> 00:21:28,106
that we can throw out in one swoop.

230
00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:34,580
Does this include Mirin?

231
00:21:36,669 --> 00:21:37,713
Maybe.

232
00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:42,620
I'm sick of being overlooked.

233
00:21:44,863 --> 00:21:46,583
I think I've had enough.

234
00:22:06,467 --> 00:22:08,504
(You changed your name to Neeraaumpan)

235
00:22:10,421 --> 00:22:12,101
just to get me to hire you.

236
00:22:15,613 --> 00:22:17,860
You're the only woman in the whole world

237
00:22:18,615 --> 00:22:21,024
who could make me feel so stupid!

238
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,260
Go, Mirin.

239
00:22:34,947 --> 00:22:36,260
Get out!

240
00:22:41,724 --> 00:22:42,404
Mr. Vee.

241
00:22:44,878 --> 00:22:45,906
Go, Mirin.

242
00:22:47,221 --> 00:22:52,306
Don't use poverty as an excuse for doing such a horrible thing.

243
00:23:05,778 --> 00:23:06,904
(Mr. Vee,)

244
00:23:07,872 --> 00:23:10,146
(please give me a chance to explain.)

245
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:15,615
(I know I was wrong for lying to you.)

246
00:23:16,183 --> 00:23:17,949
(But please give me a chance.)

247
00:23:19,323 --> 00:23:22,707
(Will you please let me take you to your mother?)

248
00:23:23,356 --> 00:23:24,812
(After that,)

249
00:23:26,023 --> 00:23:28,040
(you can hate me all you want.)

250
00:23:28,065 --> 00:23:29,796
(Read)

251
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:38,704
(Just tell me where my mother is.)

252
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,090
(Yes. Please go to this address.)

253
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,890
(Mirin)

254
00:24:49,149 --> 00:24:52,906
Kem, I need you to get Neeraaumpan out of that church tomorrow.

255
00:24:53,635 --> 00:24:56,207
Don't let anyone there know who you are.

256
00:24:57,744 --> 00:24:58,513
(Yes, ma'am.)

257
00:24:58,753 --> 00:25:00,261
(Where should I take her?)

258
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,504
I'll send you the location.

259
00:25:03,932 --> 00:25:05,603
Call me when you have her.

260
00:25:07,224 --> 00:25:09,203
I want to talk to her

261
00:25:09,836 --> 00:25:11,709
about what she's been up to all these years

262
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:14,456
and why she sent Mirin here.

263
00:26:15,176 --> 00:26:16,101
Hello.

264
00:26:16,556 --> 00:26:18,909
I'm afraid the church is closed to the public today.

265
00:26:20,498 --> 00:26:21,533
Uh...

266
00:26:23,021 --> 00:26:24,741
I'm looking for someone.

267
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,138
Who is it?

268
00:26:29,669 --> 00:26:30,818
Hello, Mrs. Sroyphet?

269
00:26:32,109 --> 00:26:33,707
Neeraaumpan no longer lives here.

270
00:26:35,643 --> 00:26:38,261
The priest said she left several days ago.

271
00:26:38,509 --> 00:26:39,464
Left?

272
00:26:41,444 --> 00:26:43,915
Find out where she went to.

273
00:26:44,023 --> 00:26:45,706
(But nobody knows where she's gone.)

274
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,009
(Are you sure he wasn't lying?)

275
00:26:48,052 --> 00:26:49,983
He's a priest, ma'am.

276
00:26:50,204 --> 00:26:51,007
Ugh!

277
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:53,007
Just find out where she lives now.

278
00:26:58,012 --> 00:26:59,310
Neeraaumpan.

279
00:27:00,336 --> 00:27:02,218
Someone is here to see you.

280
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,307
Is my mother... smiling?

281
00:27:41,849 --> 00:27:43,301
Are you here to see your mother?

282
00:27:48,826 --> 00:27:49,920
Who is she?

283
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:53,504
Me?

284
00:27:55,949 --> 00:28:00,298
Uhh, I'm afraid my son isn't as tall as you are, mister.

285
00:28:01,749 --> 00:28:03,900
My baby is only 10 years old.

286
00:28:18,243 --> 00:28:22,696
Father told us to hide Neeraaumpan here as soon as Mirin called.

287
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,098
Mirin?

288
00:28:26,173 --> 00:28:32,009
Rin's family has been taking care of Neeraaumpan over the years.

289
00:28:33,204 --> 00:28:37,907
Mirin has consulted her many times whether she should let you know.

290
00:28:38,712 --> 00:28:41,823
But every time her mind is clear,

291
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:44,824
Neeraaumpan insists we shouldn't tell anyone she's here.

292
00:28:45,669 --> 00:28:47,220
Especially you.

293
00:28:48,289 --> 00:28:51,906
She doesn't want you to be disappointed that she has Alzheimer's.

294
00:28:54,221 --> 00:28:56,620
What will you do from now on?

295
00:29:02,109 --> 00:29:03,816
I'll take care of my mother.

296
00:29:05,456 --> 00:29:08,909
From now on, I'll take care of her.

297
00:29:15,858 --> 00:29:16,913
Oh, hello.

298
00:29:17,221 --> 00:29:19,424
How are you doing, Miss Number One Secretary?

299
00:29:20,336 --> 00:29:21,820
What are you even saying?

300
00:29:22,627 --> 00:29:25,509
You're doing all this by yourself?

301
00:29:25,749 --> 00:29:27,784
You know you can have someone do it for you, right?

302
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,375
It's easy enough, so I can do it.

303
00:29:31,661 --> 00:29:32,904
And you know...

304
00:29:33,381 --> 00:29:34,980
If I can't do everything myself,

305
00:29:35,318 --> 00:29:36,938
how could I deserve the Number One Secretary title?

306
00:29:42,493 --> 00:29:43,315
There.

307
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,683
Thank you.

308
00:30:06,686 --> 00:30:07,912
Good morning. Mr. Chanon.

309
00:30:08,121 --> 00:30:10,216
Good morning, Miss Greatest Secretary.

310
00:30:10,536 --> 00:30:12,404
We've got a whole day of meetings, starting early.

311
00:30:12,427 --> 00:30:14,143
The last one is at 4PM.

312
00:30:14,161 --> 00:30:17,773
Most are with the investors who got interested after your presentation.

313
00:30:18,458 --> 00:30:20,463
They're all here with an intention to invest.

314
00:30:20,633 --> 00:30:22,863
Except for Miss Big Noi, though.

315
00:30:26,544 --> 00:30:27,803
Did you contact her?

316
00:30:28,266 --> 00:30:29,466
I did.

317
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,501
She refused to talk to anyone but Mr. Veekit and Mirin.

318
00:30:34,338 --> 00:30:35,704
We'll sort that out later.

319
00:30:36,541 --> 00:30:39,300
Focus on taking care of everyone who's here for now.

320
00:30:40,024 --> 00:30:41,180
Anytime, Boss.

321
00:30:42,078 --> 00:30:43,509
Hold on, Boss.

322
00:30:43,836 --> 00:30:44,695
Here.

323
00:30:45,246 --> 00:30:47,600
Something to keep your morale up for the day.

324
00:30:50,256 --> 00:30:52,880
You're the best, my Number One Secretary.

325
00:31:33,815 --> 00:31:35,409
Nothing from Big Noi yet?

326
00:31:36,483 --> 00:31:37,409
No.

327
00:31:37,752 --> 00:31:39,803
I'll get right on it.

328
00:31:40,526 --> 00:31:43,220
I'll leave things in your hands in the meantime.

329
00:31:43,763 --> 00:31:45,509
I won't be here for a while.

330
00:31:47,861 --> 00:31:48,703
Yes.

331
00:31:49,386 --> 00:31:50,807
Are you going abroad, Grandpa?

332
00:31:50,816 --> 00:31:51,615
No.

333
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,609
I'll be looking for Veekit.

334
00:31:55,735 --> 00:31:57,509
With you, I'm not worried about anything over here.

335
00:31:58,575 --> 00:32:00,401
Just try to get Big Noi back.

336
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:06,184
We need her investment for this.

337
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:34,781
Tell the housekeeper this is the last time she needs to clean this room.

338
00:32:35,016 --> 00:32:36,700
There's no need to do this again tomorrow.

339
00:32:38,775 --> 00:32:39,578
Pardon?

340
00:32:41,212 --> 00:32:41,978
Yes?

341
00:32:42,403 --> 00:32:43,604
Did you not hear me?

342
00:32:45,193 --> 00:32:46,780
Oh, no.

343
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:47,980
I heard you.

344
00:33:23,295 --> 00:33:24,286
Mirin.

345
00:33:28,476 --> 00:33:29,901
Hello, Aunt Noi.

346
00:33:31,152 --> 00:33:33,100
How long do you plan to keep running away from me?

347
00:33:33,524 --> 00:33:35,806
What will you do about the money I invested?

348
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,780
I won't work with Chanon.

349
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,709
I chose Veekit.

350
00:33:40,764 --> 00:33:43,304
I will only work with him.

351
00:33:44,516 --> 00:33:46,860
Mr. Vee hasn't gone back to work?

352
00:33:47,092 --> 00:33:48,409
He certainly has not.

353
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:50,253
You don't know anything?

354
00:33:50,269 --> 00:33:51,021
Huh?

355
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:56,104
I thought you're avoiding me because you know your boss' been slacking off.

356
00:33:57,973 --> 00:33:59,935
Aunt Noi, I quit.

357
00:34:00,106 --> 00:34:01,144
You quit?

358
00:34:01,656 --> 00:34:02,801
Ugh!

359
00:34:04,243 --> 00:34:06,050
What a headache.

360
00:34:06,066 --> 00:34:08,503
Both Veekit and you are.

361
00:34:08,738 --> 00:34:13,900
I don't care how, but you need to contact him.

362
00:34:14,286 --> 00:34:16,300
If he doesn't come back soon,

363
00:34:17,244 --> 00:34:20,781
I will certainly withdraw my investment.

364
00:34:36,483 --> 00:34:37,378
Please come in.

365
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:42,606
Mirin.

366
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,618
Are you here for a job interview?

367
00:34:47,778 --> 00:34:49,643
Mr. Veekit hasn't come back to work?

368
00:34:58,036 --> 00:35:00,600
Every day someone asks after Veekit.

369
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,621
Every day.

370
00:35:03,353 --> 00:35:04,704
Multiple times.

371
00:35:08,083 --> 00:35:10,406
No, he hasn't come back.

372
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,380
As you can see, all the work has inevitably fallen to my pile.

373
00:35:17,366 --> 00:35:20,263
Is anyone looking for him?

374
00:35:22,784 --> 00:35:24,064
We sent out a team.

375
00:35:25,783 --> 00:35:28,209
Grandpa also went after him.

376
00:35:31,909 --> 00:35:34,309
But you are more than welcomed to work with me in the meantime.

377
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:36,621
You don't need to wait for your boss to come back.

378
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:44,412
You gave Mr. Veekit those photos, didn't you, Mr. Chanon?

379
00:35:53,163 --> 00:35:54,509
I know I was wrong.

380
00:35:55,296 --> 00:35:57,298
I know what I did.

381
00:35:58,244 --> 00:36:00,898
But the timing and the way you did it

382
00:36:01,658 --> 00:36:03,931
could easily be mistaken for a ruse

383
00:36:03,956 --> 00:36:07,834
to take Mr. Vee down with his personal problem.

384
00:36:08,636 --> 00:36:11,093
I'm sick of explaining myself.

385
00:36:12,153 --> 00:36:15,203
So I refuse to talk any further about this matter.

386
00:36:15,836 --> 00:36:19,060
I don't care what you or anyone says or thinks.

387
00:36:19,798 --> 00:36:21,507
I'm so damn happy right now.

388
00:36:22,056 --> 00:36:23,507
That's all I want.

389
00:36:37,121 --> 00:36:39,304
Our company is willing to welcome you back.

390
00:36:40,801 --> 00:36:43,336
But if you want to get stuck on your old boss,

391
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:45,406
then, that's all up to you.

392
00:37:01,715 --> 00:37:02,941
You can't find her?

393
00:37:02,953 --> 00:37:04,780
What do you mean she just disappeared?

394
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,913
Did the money I spent on you mean nothing?

395
00:37:08,043 --> 00:37:10,021
How could you have failed so badly?

396
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:11,726
I'm sorry, Mrs. Sroyphet.

397
00:37:11,735 --> 00:37:13,423
Your apology is useless!

398
00:37:14,221 --> 00:37:17,980
Do whatever it takes to find out where Neeraaumpan is,

399
00:37:17,996 --> 00:37:19,586
and bring her to me.

400
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,206
Yes.

401
00:37:22,453 --> 00:37:23,181
Go!

402
00:37:59,275 --> 00:38:01,207
Are you here to see your mother again?

403
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:02,804
Yes.

404
00:38:04,106 --> 00:38:06,860
The doctor doesn't want her to go home yet

405
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:09,258
because they fear it might cause her more harm than good.

406
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:12,006
While her memories are fading,

407
00:38:12,253 --> 00:38:14,706
she will be in a state of cognitive impairment.

408
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:19,320
All we can do now is wait for her memory

409
00:38:19,345 --> 00:38:20,967
to return before we tell her about you.

410
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,338
If she agrees, you can take her home.

411
00:38:25,146 --> 00:38:27,143
Does it usually last this long?

412
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,140
I've seen longer.

413
00:38:35,061 --> 00:38:37,940
This symptom will keep occurring until...

414
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:43,938
Until Neeraaumpan doesn't remember anything at all.

415
00:38:53,649 --> 00:38:59,015
It doesn't matter, I'll take good care of her.

416
00:39:01,373 --> 00:39:06,703
I'll try my best to make her memories stay with me as long as they can.

417
00:39:09,329 --> 00:39:11,313
I believe you can do it, Mr. Veekit.

418
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,509
God bless you.

419
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:26,860
(Is there any way that might help bring her memory back faster?)

420
00:39:27,632 --> 00:39:30,460
(You can try telling her about the past.)

421
00:39:31,153 --> 00:39:33,709
(Create a familiar scenario for her.)

422
00:39:35,218 --> 00:39:39,806
(Music, films, and food could be helpful.)

423
00:39:40,458 --> 00:39:42,860
(They might incite something in her mind.)

424
00:39:51,213 --> 00:39:52,101
Mr. Vee.

425
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,206
I need you to teach me how to make hot chocolate.

426
00:40:27,955 --> 00:40:29,200
Right now.

427
00:40:36,086 --> 00:40:37,023
Of course.

Directed by Ekkasit Trakulkasemsuk and Pantip Vibultham

429
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,104
I made you something.

430
00:41:23,449 --> 00:41:24,516
Thank you.

431
00:41:27,415 --> 00:41:29,803
You're very kind, mister.

432
00:41:50,836 --> 00:41:53,509
Chanon has openly set himself up as your rival.

433
00:41:53,569 --> 00:41:55,061
What do you think he needs?

434
00:41:55,313 --> 00:41:57,310
Your grandfather's acceptance.

435
00:41:57,433 --> 00:42:03,380
With Veekit gone, I think this is the only time you can take over Next.

436
00:42:03,593 --> 00:42:05,604
I want you to do business with me.

437
00:42:05,752 --> 00:42:09,987
Next Innovation, under Chanon, has started selling its stocks.

438
00:42:10,003 --> 00:42:12,855
Domestic and foreign investors both agree that

439
00:42:12,869 --> 00:42:17,166
this move will take the company in an interesting direction.

440
00:42:17,195 --> 00:42:20,421
What matters most right now is your mother.

441
00:42:20,529 --> 00:42:22,069
Neeraaumpan is missing.

442
00:42:22,356 --> 00:42:23,407
Mom.

443
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,230
Mom!
