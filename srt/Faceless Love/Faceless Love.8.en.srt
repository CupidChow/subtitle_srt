1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,413
I’m not being a spoiled brat.

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:06,610
Neeraaumpan handed in her resignation letter two days ago.

3
00:00:06,682 --> 00:00:07,909
I’m going to go look for her.

4
00:00:08,102 --> 00:00:08,791
I’m coming with you.

5
00:00:08,825 --> 00:00:11,976
Are you sure you’re not the reason she disappeared?

6
00:00:13,254 --> 00:00:15,114
Do you have a place you go to to take a breather?

7
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:16,330
Actually, I do.

8
00:00:16,585 --> 00:00:17,308
Mirin!

9
00:00:17,842 --> 00:00:20,136
Do you have any idea how long I’ve been looking for you?

10
00:00:20,167 --> 00:00:22,354
Because there is something I really did you wrong.

11
00:00:22,364 --> 00:00:23,214
What did you do?

12
00:00:23,305 --> 00:00:24,309
Just tell me.

13
00:00:24,477 --> 00:00:28,008
This woman is Neeraaumpan.

14
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,530
Mr. Vee.

15
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:41,202
Actually, I…

16
00:00:43,811 --> 00:00:45,542
What face are you making?

17
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:52,739
I feel heavy-hearted.

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,408
I feel guilty that…

19
00:00:57,035 --> 00:00:58,506
that you disappeared?

20
00:01:01,305 --> 00:01:02,404
You should be.

21
00:01:04,792 --> 00:01:07,537
Do you know when you disappeared,

22
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,208
everyone was worried about you?

23
00:01:11,194 --> 00:01:17,607
I really hate it when someone disappears from my life.

24
00:01:19,442 --> 00:01:20,459
Mr. Vee.

25
00:01:20,474 --> 00:01:21,945
I’m begging you.

26
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,539
Don’t disappear again.

27
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,151
I felt like…

28
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:37,939
my heart went missing

29
00:01:40,592 --> 00:01:43,217
after my mom disappeared.

30
00:01:59,334 --> 00:02:00,505
I…

31
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,311
I mean…

32
00:02:04,321 --> 00:02:05,398
Mr. Vee.

33
00:02:05,414 --> 00:02:06,337
Please stop.

34
00:02:07,971 --> 00:02:09,814
If you keep talking,

35
00:02:13,054 --> 00:02:15,208
I won’t be able to tell you that I…

36
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:50,170
Jirawat Sutivanichsak

37
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,490
Supassara Thanachart

38
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,410
Ishikawa Plowden

39
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,010
Phatchatorn Thanawat / Wanwimol Jaenasavamethee

40
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:11,490
Phanuroj Chalermkijporntavee / Chayakorn Jutamas

41
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,210
Directed by Ekkasit Trakulkasemsuk and Pantip Vibultham

42
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:47,210
WHO IS THAT WOMAN?

43
00:04:08,795 --> 00:04:10,257
I know everything.

44
00:04:12,108 --> 00:04:13,114
Huh?

45
00:04:15,179 --> 00:04:16,608
You have feelings for me.

46
00:04:18,226 --> 00:04:19,800
You think it’s wrong.

47
00:04:20,545 --> 00:04:22,374
Because I am the CEO of the company.

48
00:04:24,728 --> 00:04:26,306
I’ll tell you something.

49
00:04:27,737 --> 00:04:28,804
It’s okay.

50
00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:31,103
I’m the CEO of the company.

51
00:04:31,527 --> 00:04:33,105
I can amend the company’s regulations.

52
00:04:33,789 --> 00:04:35,333
You can come back to work.

53
00:04:35,345 --> 00:04:36,511
Don’t worry.

54
00:04:37,376 --> 00:04:39,202
Mr. Vee, it’s not what you think.

55
00:04:39,841 --> 00:04:40,976
Or…

56
00:04:41,685 --> 00:04:43,376
are you saying that…

57
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,327
you not only have feelings for me

58
00:04:46,931 --> 00:04:48,405
but you actually fall in love with me?

59
00:04:50,628 --> 00:04:53,108
Mr. Vee, listen to me.

60
00:04:55,274 --> 00:04:58,619
There’s something that I did you wrong.

61
00:04:59,524 --> 00:05:00,860
It’s very wrong.

62
00:05:01,173 --> 00:05:06,862
It’s the kind of wrong that you will never forgive me if you find…

63
00:05:16,398 --> 00:05:17,817
I don’t want to hear it.

64
00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:22,620
If it is something so big that you decided to disappear from my life,

65
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,503
I don’t want to hear it.

66
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,502
Mr. Vee.

67
00:05:30,343 --> 00:05:32,100
Whatever the truth is,

68
00:05:33,688 --> 00:05:35,202
I don’t want to hear it.

69
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,339
I don’t want to lose you again.

70
00:05:47,385 --> 00:05:49,807
This is from the heart of the man you called the Sun,

71
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,404
the Nemesis,

72
00:05:53,635 --> 00:05:55,497
the center of the universe,

73
00:05:55,773 --> 00:05:57,411
the three-legged scorpion,

74
00:05:57,635 --> 00:05:59,105
the blood-sucking spider,

75
00:05:59,611 --> 00:06:00,922
the utility pole,

76
00:06:00,933 --> 00:06:03,002
every nickname you ever called me.

77
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,008
I love you, Mirin.

78
00:06:29,201 --> 00:06:30,217
Wait a sec.

79
00:06:36,862 --> 00:06:37,914
Hello.

80
00:06:39,491 --> 00:06:40,306
Yes.

81
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,805
I found her.

82
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:45,300
She’s with me.

83
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:48,502
Sure.

84
00:06:48,733 --> 00:06:49,260
Yes.

85
00:06:49,272 --> 00:06:50,308
Bye.

86
00:06:54,376 --> 00:06:58,602
Big Noi said she wanted 15 boxes of brownies tomorrow.

87
00:06:59,136 --> 00:07:00,602
It’s compensation for making her worried about you.

88
00:07:01,468 --> 00:07:03,392
Did Aunt Noi know about this?

89
00:07:03,706 --> 00:07:04,857
Of course.

90
00:07:06,502 --> 00:07:09,305
She will be lecturing me until my ears bleed.

91
00:07:09,605 --> 00:07:11,102
That’s what you deserve.

92
00:07:12,782 --> 00:07:15,659
You are lucky that all you will get is being lectured.

93
00:07:19,962 --> 00:07:22,502
The thing that you are going to tell me,

94
00:07:23,739 --> 00:07:24,705
what is it?

95
00:07:25,927 --> 00:07:27,213
You can tell me.

96
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:32,005
So we can work things out like other couples.

97
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:36,204
Other couples?

98
00:07:36,514 --> 00:07:37,841
Hurry and tell me.

99
00:07:41,991 --> 00:07:44,377
Are you free this Sunday?

100
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,418
Are you asking me out on a date?

101
00:07:49,264 --> 00:07:51,603
Why are you asking me that question?

102
00:07:52,287 --> 00:07:53,907
You are my secretary.

103
00:07:54,703 --> 00:07:56,938
I will not approve your resignation.

104
00:07:58,986 --> 00:08:00,003
Then

105
00:08:00,946 --> 00:08:02,940
I’ll tell you everything this Sunday.

106
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:08,303
Do I need to wait for a week?

107
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,540
Alright.

108
00:08:13,156 --> 00:08:14,306
I can wait.

109
00:08:15,866 --> 00:08:16,907
Girlfriend.

110
00:08:22,581 --> 00:08:23,901
Remember this.

111
00:08:24,526 --> 00:08:25,901
From now on,

112
00:08:26,689 --> 00:08:29,898
your only nickname is Girlfriend.

113
00:08:30,987 --> 00:08:32,298
If I call you that,

114
00:08:33,687 --> 00:08:35,609
you need to answer me, okay?

115
00:08:39,395 --> 00:08:43,098
What should I do with you?

116
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,098
Give me a lot of love.

117
00:08:47,733 --> 00:08:49,404
Don’t ever leave me.

118
00:08:54,698 --> 00:08:56,100
Can I hold your hand?

119
00:09:21,501 --> 00:09:23,907
If you agree to use those photos like I told you,

120
00:09:24,086 --> 00:09:26,006
you will get everything you want.

121
00:09:27,383 --> 00:09:30,106
With one stone, you can kill all the birds.

122
00:09:33,655 --> 00:09:36,098
Non, you will get everything that you want,

123
00:09:36,407 --> 00:09:37,506
the company,

124
00:09:38,206 --> 00:09:39,506
your grandfather,

125
00:09:42,009 --> 00:09:43,207
and Mirin.

126
00:09:45,661 --> 00:09:47,083
If you want to be on top,

127
00:09:47,096 --> 00:09:48,981
sometimes, you need to step on others,

128
00:09:49,441 --> 00:09:51,206
even if that person is your family.

129
00:09:51,972 --> 00:09:53,301
That’s enough, Tanya.

130
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,300
This is important.

131
00:09:55,549 --> 00:09:57,009
Give me some time to think.

132
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:59,021
What else do you need to think?

133
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:00,663
Tanya.

134
00:10:00,929 --> 00:10:03,061
I have been working hard for more than ten years.

135
00:10:03,876 --> 00:10:06,009
You can’t suddenly tell me to use this ploy.

136
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,703
Please respect my effort.

137
00:10:09,512 --> 00:10:12,306
I always respect and admire you.

138
00:10:13,886 --> 00:10:15,309
What about your grandfather,

139
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,803
your company,

140
00:10:18,724 --> 00:10:20,303
your cousin?

141
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,406
Have they ever shown you any respect?

142
00:10:25,496 --> 00:10:27,310
If this was concerned only you,

143
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,707
you could take as much time as you wanted.

144
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,809
I wouldn’t care.

145
00:10:32,178 --> 00:10:33,807
But this is also about me.

146
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,709
I can’t give you much time.

147
00:10:54,593 --> 00:10:55,261
Rin.

148
00:10:55,961 --> 00:10:57,000
Where have you been?

149
00:10:59,816 --> 00:11:01,256
I’m sorry, Mom.

150
00:11:02,146 --> 00:11:03,641
You should have told me where you went.

151
00:11:03,652 --> 00:11:05,304
You shouldn’t disappear without saying anything.

152
00:11:06,084 --> 00:11:07,804
Is this because I told you to resign from the company?

153
00:11:12,267 --> 00:11:13,803
Did it go well?

154
00:11:14,244 --> 00:11:15,661
Did you submit your resignation?

155
00:11:16,073 --> 00:11:17,709
Did you tell him the truth?

156
00:11:21,756 --> 00:11:23,303
I submit my resignation.

157
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:28,856
I tried to tell him the truth but…

158
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,603
But what?

159
00:11:35,156 --> 00:11:37,221
He said he loves me.

160
00:11:45,516 --> 00:11:47,103
What did you tell him?

161
00:11:53,326 --> 00:11:55,100
I love him too, Mom.

162
00:11:59,115 --> 00:12:01,204
My poor baby.

163
00:12:10,589 --> 00:12:11,544
Mom.

164
00:12:12,003 --> 00:12:14,312
I will try to tell him the truth.

165
00:12:15,198 --> 00:12:16,806
Please give me some time.

166
00:12:22,536 --> 00:12:23,507
Rin.

167
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:28,607
Love can’t be denied.

168
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:33,401
There should not be any secrets between lovers as well.

169
00:12:36,867 --> 00:12:38,200
Remember my words.

170
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,976
You start this relationship with lies.

171
00:12:42,415 --> 00:12:44,578
You will have to continue to lie to him.

172
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:55,376
I’ll tell him soon.

173
00:12:55,884 --> 00:12:57,106
I promise.

174
00:12:57,664 --> 00:13:00,509
I’ll tell him everything and face the music.

175
00:13:00,983 --> 00:13:03,781
He can be mad or hate me if he wants.

176
00:13:05,653 --> 00:13:06,601
Good.

177
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:21,460
This woman is Neeraaumpan.

178
00:13:21,847 --> 00:13:24,649
Veekit’s mother who has been missing.

179
00:13:27,229 --> 00:13:29,980
I always respect and admire you.

180
00:13:30,275 --> 00:13:31,706
What about your grandfather,

181
00:13:32,798 --> 00:13:34,112
your company,

182
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,304
(your cousin?)

183
00:13:36,575 --> 00:13:38,018
(Have they ever shown you any respect?)

184
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,583
Mr. Vee, what are you doing here?

185
00:14:06,841 --> 00:14:08,981
I’m here to pick you up.

186
00:14:09,044 --> 00:14:10,021
Girlfriend.

187
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,423
Mr. Vee.

188
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:15,660
Let’s go if we don’t want to be late.

189
00:14:17,086 --> 00:14:18,504
Wait.

190
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:21,303
Should I go in and greet your mom and grandma first?

191
00:14:21,638 --> 00:14:23,303
We will become family soon.

192
00:14:23,381 --> 00:14:24,256
Stop.

193
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,544
Stop right there.

194
00:14:28,938 --> 00:14:29,807
Okay.

195
00:14:29,944 --> 00:14:31,144
Get in the car.

196
00:14:38,575 --> 00:14:39,541
Get in the car.

197
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,689
Do I need to open the door for you?

198
00:14:41,849 --> 00:14:43,104
It’s okay.

199
00:15:07,938 --> 00:15:09,107
Hey, Girlfriend.

200
00:15:10,203 --> 00:15:12,707
When we are outside, you are my girlfriend.

201
00:15:12,983 --> 00:15:14,426
But when we are at the company,

202
00:15:14,449 --> 00:15:16,426
it won’t look good if we act all lovey-dovey.

203
00:15:17,036 --> 00:15:18,600
I hope you will understand me.

204
00:15:18,921 --> 00:15:21,060
You can’t pick up a fight with me over this later.

205
00:15:22,126 --> 00:15:23,301
Yes?

206
00:15:24,306 --> 00:15:26,009
It’s great that you understand.

207
00:15:46,141 --> 00:15:47,138
Mr. Vee.

208
00:15:47,715 --> 00:15:51,906
I think I should go back to my desk.

209
00:15:52,158 --> 00:15:53,906
If we are doing this, people may find out.

210
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,940
Sit here and do your job.

211
00:15:57,106 --> 00:15:58,140
Don’t worry.

212
00:15:58,275 --> 00:15:59,418
I’ll take care of everything.

213
00:16:00,912 --> 00:16:04,460
Mr. Vee, I haven’t agreed to be your girlfriend.

214
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,204
Oh.

215
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,703
What you said hurts me.

216
00:16:08,869 --> 00:16:10,409
I’m very hurt.

217
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:12,509
Fine.

218
00:16:13,235 --> 00:16:15,235
If you want to make it official,

219
00:16:16,135 --> 00:16:18,090
Go get the document from the printer.

220
00:16:20,152 --> 00:16:21,204
What?

221
00:16:21,795 --> 00:16:22,900
Now.

222
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,056
[Will you be my girlfriend?]

223
00:16:45,056 --> 00:16:46,210
Will you be my girlfriend, Mirin? [Will you be my girlfriend?]

224
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,376
Will you be my girlfriend, Mirin?

225
00:16:55,438 --> 00:16:57,344
I will give the universe

226
00:16:58,103 --> 00:16:59,980
that revolves around me

227
00:17:02,595 --> 00:17:03,900
to you.

228
00:17:07,621 --> 00:17:08,701
Mr. Vee.

229
00:17:11,496 --> 00:17:12,407
So?

230
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:14,869
Are you saying yes?

231
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,009
Yes?

232
00:17:17,258 --> 00:17:18,598
Yes, yes.

233
00:17:18,767 --> 00:17:20,203
Say it.

234
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,632
Will you be my girlfriend?

235
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:22,701
Mr. Vee.

236
00:17:26,401 --> 00:17:27,309
Okay.

237
00:17:27,423 --> 00:17:29,461
I’ll take that as a yes.

238
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,658
Okay.

239
00:18:10,366 --> 00:18:11,909
Just do your best today.

240
00:18:13,052 --> 00:18:14,976
It will be over by the end of the week.

241
00:18:17,233 --> 00:18:19,530
What will be over this week?

242
00:18:21,664 --> 00:18:22,804
What?

243
00:18:24,735 --> 00:18:26,247
What will you do this week?

244
00:18:28,672 --> 00:18:29,903
Are you going to the church?

245
00:18:35,484 --> 00:18:37,903
Yesterday, everyone was worried about you.

246
00:18:38,741 --> 00:18:41,141
If you are going to take a breather, you should tell me.

247
00:18:42,144 --> 00:18:43,301
I’m sorry.

248
00:18:44,481 --> 00:18:45,706
You don’t need to apologize.

249
00:18:46,552 --> 00:18:50,703
But you can’t secretly submit your resignation again.

250
00:18:58,549 --> 00:19:01,098
Heart-shaped marshmallows?

251
00:19:02,301 --> 00:19:03,461
I want them too.

252
00:19:04,533 --> 00:19:05,860
Can you make another cup for me?

253
00:19:07,436 --> 00:19:09,036
You can secretly make it behind Veekit’s back.

254
00:19:10,324 --> 00:19:12,978
He is so possessive about his hot chocolate,

255
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:14,607
his secretary,

256
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,006
and everything.

257
00:19:16,409 --> 00:19:17,778
I can’t understand him.

258
00:19:22,247 --> 00:19:24,509
I can make a hot chocolate for you.

259
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:28,410
But I ran out of heart-shaped marshmallows.

260
00:19:32,873 --> 00:19:35,004
Why am I so unlucky?

261
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:37,986
It’s okay.

262
00:19:37,998 --> 00:19:40,698
I still have normal marshmallows.

263
00:19:40,992 --> 00:19:42,306
I’ll make the drink for you.

264
00:20:03,229 --> 00:20:04,409
Hello, Tanya.

265
00:20:07,263 --> 00:20:09,007
About what you told me to do,

266
00:20:10,513 --> 00:20:12,178
I’ve slept on it.

267
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,106
I think it’s a good idea.

268
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:16,612
(Great.)

269
00:20:16,776 --> 00:20:20,061
(You finally do something for yourself.)

270
00:20:20,363 --> 00:20:22,460
It’s probably too late.

271
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,607
Since it’s probably too late,

272
00:20:27,696 --> 00:20:30,856
I will wait for the best timing.

273
00:20:30,973 --> 00:20:34,707
(You want to make the call when to do it, don’t you?)

274
00:20:39,469 --> 00:20:40,309
Yes.

275
00:20:43,026 --> 00:20:45,896
I made hot chocolate for Chanon this afternoon.

276
00:20:48,823 --> 00:20:50,027
I don’t like it.

277
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,707
But I’ll let it slide.

278
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:58,258
All Non does is work.

279
00:20:58,886 --> 00:21:00,660
He is serious about everything.

280
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:04,701
I think the hot chocolate could help him relax.

281
00:21:07,755 --> 00:21:10,110
Non told me that he has a place for taking a breather.

282
00:21:10,564 --> 00:21:12,403
Sometimes, he felt exhausted.

283
00:21:13,963 --> 00:21:15,180
Look at his mom.

284
00:21:15,696 --> 00:21:18,220
His mom sets high expectations for him.

285
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,306
It must be tired to be him.

286
00:21:22,989 --> 00:21:27,300
I’ll permit you to make hot chocolate for him from time to time.

287
00:21:31,884 --> 00:21:32,816
Mr. Vee.

288
00:21:33,983 --> 00:21:34,807
What?

289
00:21:36,076 --> 00:21:37,210
Thank you

290
00:21:37,909 --> 00:21:39,013
for everything.

291
00:21:41,513 --> 00:21:44,109
Thank you too, Girlfriend.

292
00:21:45,803 --> 00:21:47,607
You’re welcome, Boyfriend.

293
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,904
Are you smiling, Boyfriend?

294
00:21:56,244 --> 00:21:57,743
No, I’m not.

295
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,933
- Are you smiling, Boyfriend? - No, I’m not.

296
00:21:59,949 --> 00:22:03,109
- Are you smiling? - Keep your voice down. I’m not smiling.

297
00:23:04,235 --> 00:23:07,347
The application that we are working on with Big Noi,

298
00:23:07,363 --> 00:23:09,800
It’s undergoing a legal assessment.

299
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:14,980
The other applications that we have launched have superb performance.

300
00:23:15,536 --> 00:23:18,203
The number of users in every app is on the rise.

301
00:23:18,233 --> 00:23:20,701
It has been increasing to date.

302
00:23:21,795 --> 00:23:23,100
What about the feedback from the shareholders?

303
00:23:23,295 --> 00:23:25,100
The shareholders?

304
00:23:25,898 --> 00:23:27,341
They are very happy with the performance.

305
00:23:27,555 --> 00:23:28,526
Good job, Veekit.

306
00:23:41,927 --> 00:23:44,007
Everyone looks happy, BF.

307
00:23:45,836 --> 00:23:47,709
Thank you, GF.

308
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:50,780
Okay, this is our last agenda.

309
00:23:51,464 --> 00:23:56,806
I’m holding a party to welcome our investors from overseas this Friday.

310
00:23:57,483 --> 00:24:01,506
Please get all of our business plans ready to present to them.

311
00:24:02,218 --> 00:24:03,304
Yes, Grandpa.

312
00:24:03,498 --> 00:24:05,304
I’ll do my best.

313
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,501
Yes, Granddad.

314
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,201
This party is very important.

315
00:24:09,536 --> 00:24:12,101
Though it may look like a casual party,

316
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,820
it can affect our reputation.

317
00:24:15,207 --> 00:24:17,909
I need to ask you to supervise the party planning.

318
00:24:18,769 --> 00:24:20,203
I’m happy to do it, Dad.

319
00:24:20,529 --> 00:24:22,820
Then the meeting is adjourned.

320
00:24:28,855 --> 00:24:34,660
Aew-aes, can I have the latest update on all the applications?

321
00:24:34,672 --> 00:24:37,860
I also have to ask you to stay late at work today.

322
00:24:38,856 --> 00:24:40,000
Anytime.

323
00:24:40,072 --> 00:24:42,000
If you give your all in, so do I.

324
00:24:42,695 --> 00:24:44,416
If there’s anything I can help,

325
00:24:44,893 --> 00:24:46,261
you can always tell me.

326
00:24:47,035 --> 00:24:49,001
So you can compete with Veekit.

327
00:24:50,349 --> 00:24:51,741
I know Non will do well.

328
00:24:52,101 --> 00:24:52,941
I’m sure of it.

329
00:24:54,227 --> 00:24:55,110
Yes.

330
00:24:55,295 --> 00:24:56,613
I’m sure of it too.

331
00:24:57,866 --> 00:24:59,200
You can do it.

332
00:24:59,646 --> 00:25:03,540
Because I gave Mirin permission to make hot chocolate for you.

333
00:25:04,972 --> 00:25:07,463
You are saying as if he is owning something to you.

334
00:25:07,473 --> 00:25:09,401
She just makes hot chocolate for him.

335
00:25:09,503 --> 00:25:12,096
Isn’t that a part of the secretary’s job?

336
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,304
She is not just a secretary.

337
00:25:36,721 --> 00:25:37,607
Wait.

338
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,658
Are they dating?

339
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:48,060
Veekit, keep falling as far as you can.

340
00:25:48,316 --> 00:25:49,780
I’m rooting for you.

341
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,178
He is not falling, Mom.

342
00:25:53,612 --> 00:25:55,001
Don’t you see?

343
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,501
He’s doing better every day because he has Mirin.

344
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:15,609
Then I need to kick her out as soon as possible.

345
00:26:45,861 --> 00:26:47,198
Hello, Tanya.

346
00:26:48,335 --> 00:26:51,100
I know when we are going to use those photos.

347
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,004
Great, Non.

348
00:26:53,063 --> 00:26:54,578
This is what a friend is for.

349
00:26:55,223 --> 00:26:57,807
Tell me your plan when you are ready.

350
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:01,780
I also need to have my own plan to deal with Veekit.

351
00:27:10,167 --> 00:27:12,103
Let’s call it a day.

352
00:27:12,946 --> 00:27:15,409
We can continue to work on it later.

353
00:27:15,933 --> 00:27:18,015
We need to wait for confirmation from other departments anyway.

354
00:27:20,698 --> 00:27:21,606
Alright.

355
00:27:32,967 --> 00:27:33,809
What?

356
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,306
Are you tired?

357
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:41,900
I’m okay.

358
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:45,100
But I’m not okay.

359
00:27:47,101 --> 00:27:48,700
Come on, let me charge my battery.

360
00:27:52,476 --> 00:27:54,609
I am scowling at you.

361
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,204
I don’t care if you are scowling or not.

362
00:27:57,381 --> 00:27:58,903
Because I can’t see it anyway.

363
00:27:59,515 --> 00:28:00,503
Come on.

364
00:28:14,069 --> 00:28:16,140
My girlfriend is so petite.

365
00:28:16,835 --> 00:28:18,206
I’ll protect you.

366
00:28:18,955 --> 00:28:20,940
I won’t let anyone hurt you.

367
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:28,609
I won’t let anyone hurt my boyfriend as well.

368
00:28:41,652 --> 00:28:42,815
Charging battery.

369
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,661
I’m feeling sleepy.

370
00:29:07,016 --> 00:29:08,058
Is this okay?

371
00:29:12,909 --> 00:29:14,104
It looks okay.

372
00:29:22,101 --> 00:29:23,612
Is this okay, Boss?

373
00:29:55,749 --> 00:29:58,332
I want the food to have a mild taste and a vast variety.

374
00:29:58,372 --> 00:30:00,503
Don’t forget to send the guest list to me to check.

375
00:30:01,307 --> 00:30:05,307
Make sure that Tanya sits next to Veekit.

376
00:30:05,564 --> 00:30:06,810
Yes, Mrs. Sroyphet.

377
00:30:13,036 --> 00:30:14,735
Why didn’t Manit come to meet me?

378
00:30:15,169 --> 00:30:17,216
I have many details I want to ask him.

379
00:30:17,558 --> 00:30:19,903
Manit is having a meeting with Mr. Chanon.

380
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:21,409
So he can’t come to meet you.

381
00:30:23,413 --> 00:30:25,607
I’ve been trying to make an appointment with him all week.

382
00:30:25,955 --> 00:30:27,820
How can a programmer be busier than the CEO?

383
00:30:29,415 --> 00:30:31,612
Do you have anything I can help you in the meantime?

384
00:30:34,944 --> 00:30:36,578
No. You can go back to work.

385
00:30:36,933 --> 00:30:38,978
Yes sir, CEO.

386
00:30:47,581 --> 00:30:50,534
The models for the other two applications

387
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:51,668
will be completed this evening.

388
00:30:51,693 --> 00:30:52,998
You don’t have to worry about them, Chanon.

389
00:30:53,972 --> 00:30:54,904
Thank you.

390
00:30:57,358 --> 00:30:59,609
I haven’t started work on Veekit’s project.

391
00:31:00,163 --> 00:31:01,801
I chose to work on your project first.

392
00:31:04,747 --> 00:31:06,606
Be careful. Veekit may be pressuring you.

393
00:31:07,904 --> 00:31:09,803
I don’t think he will stay here long

394
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:11,807
I think I should work on your project first.

395
00:31:12,584 --> 00:31:14,507
Thank you so much, Manit.

396
00:31:14,524 --> 00:31:16,500
Please take care of the rest.

397
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,701
Sure.

398
00:31:17,929 --> 00:31:19,661
I’ll keep you posted.

399
00:31:20,156 --> 00:31:21,895
Excuse me.

400
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:23,409
Thank you.

401
00:31:26,081 --> 00:31:28,409
The employees started to choose sides.

402
00:31:31,483 --> 00:31:32,378
It’s only Manit.

403
00:31:32,964 --> 00:31:34,601
He doesn’t like Veekit.

404
00:31:35,173 --> 00:31:38,090
Not only Manit, but I’m also on your side.

405
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:48,938
Veekit is dating Mirin.

406
00:31:49,123 --> 00:31:49,896
Huh?

407
00:31:51,506 --> 00:31:52,540
Since when?

408
00:31:53,467 --> 00:31:55,301
I just found out the other day.

409
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:57,535
They held hands and walked out of the meeting room

410
00:31:57,555 --> 00:31:59,504
in front of me and Chanon.

411
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:06,938
This is why Non agrees to do it.

412
00:32:08,475 --> 00:32:09,340
Do what?

413
00:32:09,795 --> 00:32:12,404
The plan to destroy Veekit.

414
00:32:14,529 --> 00:32:18,406
I can’t believe that he is really dating his secretary.

415
00:32:20,201 --> 00:32:21,341
A secretary?!

416
00:32:22,053 --> 00:32:24,603
Although she seems to be naïve,

417
00:32:25,233 --> 00:32:28,515
I think she does everything to seduce Veekit until he falls for her.

418
00:32:28,964 --> 00:32:32,012
I’m sure you can bring him back.

419
00:32:32,524 --> 00:32:34,615
You are a catch no matter what.

420
00:32:36,716 --> 00:32:38,909
It doesn’t matter if he will come back to me or not.

421
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,909
Right now, all I want is to get rid of his secretary.

422
00:32:43,826 --> 00:32:45,406
I’ll deal with other things later.

423
00:32:57,572 --> 00:32:58,615
Why are you acting surprised?

424
00:32:59,586 --> 00:33:01,003
You stole my man.

425
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,509
You shouldn’t be surprised by this.

426
00:33:04,012 --> 00:33:05,603
Stop pretending to be the damsel in distress.

427
00:33:09,207 --> 00:33:10,607
Well done.

428
00:33:10,786 --> 00:33:12,113
You are so good at it.

429
00:33:12,369 --> 00:33:13,710
I give you credit for it.

430
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,507
Teach me.

431
00:33:16,826 --> 00:33:20,403
How should I flirt or seduce him so that he will fall for me?

432
00:33:20,664 --> 00:33:25,420
Being a wealthy and high-profile woman must be a wrong move for me.

433
00:33:26,395 --> 00:33:28,301
I should have pretended to be poor,

434
00:33:29,196 --> 00:33:30,221
have low education,

435
00:33:31,318 --> 00:33:33,409
not know much about social etiquette,

436
00:33:33,883 --> 00:33:38,169
and act like a helpless woman like you.

437
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,100
Miss Tanya.

438
00:33:40,363 --> 00:33:41,213
What?

439
00:33:42,573 --> 00:33:43,781
What, Mirin?

440
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:45,709
Are you upset?

441
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:49,206
Why don’t you run and tell Veekit about this?

442
00:33:49,998 --> 00:33:50,535
Do it.

443
00:33:50,552 --> 00:33:51,515
Please stop it.

444
00:33:52,396 --> 00:33:55,206
I’m sorry that you feel hurt.

445
00:33:56,241 --> 00:33:58,507
But I am sure that I didn’t do anything wrong.

446
00:33:58,981 --> 00:34:01,404
You have never been my choice.

447
00:34:06,449 --> 00:34:08,978
Are you sure about what you said?

448
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:12,583
I have never been more sure in my life.

449
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:17,380
I’m sorry but can I be honest with you?

450
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,524
I never liked your perfume.

451
00:34:20,947 --> 00:34:22,801
I never liked your voice.

452
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,781
Okay, you dress well.

453
00:34:26,301 --> 00:34:27,804
You have a good taste.

454
00:34:28,463 --> 00:34:30,287
But I never find you pretty.

455
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,107
Veekit.

456
00:34:32,029 --> 00:34:34,709
If you continue to talk badly to Mirin,

457
00:34:35,684 --> 00:34:37,107
I will not let it slide.

458
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,100
Is there anything else you want to say?

459
00:34:43,663 --> 00:34:45,609
If you have, then say it to me.

460
00:34:46,796 --> 00:34:48,109
If not,

461
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,910
please excuse us.

462
00:35:09,776 --> 00:35:10,704
Mirin.

463
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,907
You are so dead.

464
00:35:16,464 --> 00:35:17,913
Are you okay?

465
00:35:18,204 --> 00:35:19,933
Did Tanya do anything to you? Are you alright?

466
00:35:19,946 --> 00:35:21,543
Why did you put up with her?

467
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,015
Why didn’t you walk away?

468
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,110
If everyone finds out that I am dating you,

469
00:35:29,443 --> 00:35:31,507
this is what I will be constantly facing.

470
00:35:33,183 --> 00:35:35,106
I don’t know how bad it will be.

471
00:35:37,373 --> 00:35:38,303
No.

472
00:35:38,801 --> 00:35:40,806
Don’t let anyone talk to you like that.

473
00:35:42,036 --> 00:35:44,309
This is the reality, Mr. Vee.

474
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,578
No one will think that I deserve you.

475
00:35:49,292 --> 00:35:51,178
What do you mean that you don’t deserve me?

476
00:35:52,293 --> 00:35:54,781
Is it because I'm rich and you’re poor?

477
00:35:56,873 --> 00:35:58,107
I don’t care.

478
00:35:58,703 --> 00:36:00,300
We didn’t do anything wrong.

479
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,901
All I know is…

480
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:06,503
I love you.

481
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,709
What about you?

482
00:36:11,144 --> 00:36:12,410
Do you love me?

483
00:36:22,361 --> 00:36:23,803
Say it, Mirin.

484
00:36:32,604 --> 00:36:34,512
We will find a way out together.

485
00:36:35,618 --> 00:36:37,424
I’ll be by your side.

486
00:36:38,335 --> 00:36:39,806
I’ll protect you.

487
00:36:42,164 --> 00:36:46,260
I’ll give you what my mom never got.

488
00:36:49,735 --> 00:36:51,406
What do you mean?

489
00:37:05,969 --> 00:37:07,301
My mom,

490
00:37:08,715 --> 00:37:10,223
she felt very pressured

491
00:37:11,712 --> 00:37:13,509
while she was married to my dad.

492
00:37:15,172 --> 00:37:19,301
She had been nagged or criticized all the time.

493
00:37:19,692 --> 00:37:21,904
My dad barely stood up for her.

494
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,706
Because he didn’t want to offend anyone.

495
00:37:32,469 --> 00:37:33,707
I promise.

496
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:37,820
I will never let that happen to you.

497
00:37:42,903 --> 00:37:43,818
Thank you.

498
00:37:46,438 --> 00:37:48,620
Thank you for treating me well.

499
00:37:51,296 --> 00:37:52,807
Today is Thursday.

500
00:37:53,978 --> 00:37:55,600
Wait until Sunday.

501
00:37:57,086 --> 00:37:59,656
Then say these things to me again.

502
00:38:01,252 --> 00:38:03,803
Excuse me, I need to get back to work.

503
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,307
Good job, Aew-aes.

504
00:38:18,516 --> 00:38:20,898
Can I have the second batch of documents?

505
00:38:23,987 --> 00:38:24,812
Tanya.

506
00:38:28,713 --> 00:38:29,376
What’s going on?

507
00:38:29,386 --> 00:38:30,315
What happened?

508
00:38:34,007 --> 00:38:37,206
You knew about Veekit and Mirin, didn’t you?

509
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:40,404
Why didn’t you tell me?

510
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:44,715
You are useless.

511
00:38:45,672 --> 00:38:47,863
I thought you would take Mirin away from Veekit.

512
00:38:47,964 --> 00:38:49,806
Because you also like her.

513
00:38:51,381 --> 00:38:53,201
Why didn’t you fight for her?

514
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:56,260
Why didn’t you tell her that you like her?

515
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,600
You are as wealthy as Veekit.

516
00:39:00,941 --> 00:39:02,260
A woman like her,

517
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,838
she is willing to date any rich man, don’t you know?

518
00:39:04,864 --> 00:39:07,063
Tanya, it’s not about my wealth.

519
00:39:07,103 --> 00:39:08,504
Then what is it about?

520
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,404
What else can it be?

521
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,986
You are good-looking and rich.

522
00:39:16,009 --> 00:39:18,021
You have everything that Veekit has.

523
00:39:18,327 --> 00:39:19,818
Why wouldn’t she choose you?

524
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,406
It would be nice if I knew the answer.

525
00:39:27,426 --> 00:39:31,109
We love them before they love each other.

526
00:39:33,909 --> 00:39:35,418
I can’t accept it

527
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:38,806
if things are not going my way.

528
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:46,540
I love him.

529
00:39:47,247 --> 00:39:48,938
I will have him.

530
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,738
I’m willing to do terrible things to have him.

531
00:39:55,053 --> 00:39:56,500
I have to have him.

532
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:03,660
Has your cousin ever shown you any respect?

533
00:40:03,813 --> 00:40:07,004
Why are you here with my secretary?

534
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,307
I want to drink hot chocolate. Let’s go.

535
00:40:38,284 --> 00:40:40,100
Let’s do terrible things together.

536
00:40:42,318 --> 00:40:44,203
Let’s be partners in crime.

537
00:41:10,889 --> 00:41:14,178
Aew-aes, is Veekit standing by at the back?

538
00:41:15,286 --> 00:41:16,118
Yes.

539
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,606
Mr. Non said he was going to brief Veekit on something.

540
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:21,204
I think your beloved boss should be ready by now.

541
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:25,718
Hello, everyone.

542
00:41:25,743 --> 00:41:29,200
Next, please welcome Mr. Veekit Kraipiwat.

543
00:41:29,213 --> 00:41:33,607
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Veekit from Next Innovation.

544
00:41:51,735 --> 00:41:52,907
Hello.

545
00:41:53,635 --> 00:41:55,407
I’m Chanon Kanchanarak.

546
00:41:56,166 --> 00:41:59,201
I’m here on behalf of Mr. Veekit who has an emergency errand.

547
00:41:59,909 --> 00:42:02,081
I would like to introduce

548
00:42:02,106 --> 00:42:06,444
all the interesting applications of Next Innovation.

549
00:42:21,535 --> 00:42:22,500
Mr. Vee.

550
00:42:29,536 --> 00:42:30,807
Who sat next to you?

551
00:42:35,453 --> 00:42:36,901
Who was that woman in the photos?

552
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,980
Who sat next to you? Tell me.

553
00:42:43,841 --> 00:42:45,561
Mr. Vee, please hear me out.

554
00:42:45,576 --> 00:42:47,109
I can’t see faces.

555
00:42:48,623 --> 00:42:52,713
But I remember that these are your clothes,

556
00:42:53,175 --> 00:42:54,686
your bag,

557
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:56,104
and your hairstyle.

558
00:42:57,183 --> 00:42:59,100
Tell me the truth.

559
00:42:59,761 --> 00:43:02,701
The woman sitting next to you was my mom, wasn’t she?

560
00:43:12,146 --> 00:43:13,338
Answer me!

562
00:43:19,067 --> 00:43:20,015
Where?

563
00:43:20,326 --> 00:43:21,700
Is this the one?

564
00:43:22,727 --> 00:43:24,258
Look if it’s in the box.

565
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:28,606
Where is it?

566
00:43:29,215 --> 00:43:30,136
Is this the one?

567
00:43:31,226 --> 00:43:32,206
Where is it?

568
00:43:33,841 --> 00:43:34,498
Mom.

569
00:43:36,532 --> 00:43:38,538
I saw Aunt Sroy wearing a different ring every day.

570
00:43:39,046 --> 00:43:41,506
But why do you have only one ring?

571
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,601
I have many rings.

572
00:43:48,393 --> 00:43:49,600
But this ring,

573
00:43:50,912 --> 00:43:52,704
it’s the one I love the most.

574
00:43:53,646 --> 00:43:56,538
Because your dad gave it to me.

575
00:43:58,941 --> 00:44:02,003
Will you wear it for the rest of your life?

576
00:44:02,736 --> 00:44:04,930
Yes, for the rest of my life.

577
00:44:05,458 --> 00:44:06,901
I will never take it off.

578
00:44:09,807 --> 00:44:11,609
Remember my words, honey.

579
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:15,407
This ring

580
00:44:16,623 --> 00:44:18,140
is a symbol of your dad.

581
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,813
It means that he is always with me.

582
00:44:26,893 --> 00:44:29,329
You are the only woman in the world

583
00:44:29,341 --> 00:44:31,861
who can make me the biggest fool.

584
00:44:32,555 --> 00:44:33,606
Get out!

585
00:44:33,987 --> 00:44:34,909
Where is Mirin?

586
00:44:34,987 --> 00:44:36,300
How did you know that?

587
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:39,743
A woman who has the same name as your mother applied for a job here.

588
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:42,812
Anyone could tell that she was going to use you.

589
00:44:43,583 --> 00:44:46,709
(Please let me take you to see your mom.)

590
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:49,700
(Tell me where my mom is.)

591
00:44:50,572 --> 00:44:52,807
Go pick up Neeraaumpan from the church tomorrow.

592
00:44:53,432 --> 00:44:55,003
Call me when you get her.

593
00:44:56,704 --> 00:44:58,610
I want to talk to her.

594
00:44:59,312 --> 00:45:01,700
I want to know where she has been hiding all these years.
