1
00:00:00,222 --> 00:00:01,905
I still want you to walk together with me.

2
00:00:02,028 --> 00:00:03,672
I want you to be by my side

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,099
when my mom remembers me.

4
00:00:05,266 --> 00:00:06,401
Is that you, Vee?

5
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:11,662
I can see it now, Mom.

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,183
I can see it.

7
00:00:13,474 --> 00:00:15,142
You look so cute.

8
00:00:15,337 --> 00:00:19,900
I think there is only one thing that you cannot change.

9
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:22,810
Now, Chanon has turned against you.

10
00:00:23,075 --> 00:00:26,605
This is our new majority shareholder, Miss Tanya.

11
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:28,709
I'm going back to compete with Chanon.

12
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,930
Jirawat Sutivanichsak

13
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,250
Supassara Thanachart

14
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:56,170
Ishikawa Plowden

15
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,770
Phatchatorn Thanawat / Wanwimol Jaenasavamethee

16
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:07,250
Phanuroj Chalermkijporntavee / Chayakorn Jutamas

17
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,970
Directed by Ekkasit Trakulkasemsuk and Pantip Vibultham

18
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,970
THE INEVITABLE ENEMY

19
00:01:48,133 --> 00:01:49,380
Hello, Aunt Noi?

20
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,900
(Yes?)

21
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:51,780
(How was it?)

22
00:01:51,853 --> 00:01:53,857
I was waiting for you to ask me that.

23
00:01:54,108 --> 00:01:55,210
Here's the thing, Aunt Noi,

24
00:01:55,493 --> 00:01:57,210
Mr. Vee is ready to get back in the field.

25
00:01:57,733 --> 00:01:59,605
(Finally.)

26
00:02:00,072 --> 00:02:03,299
(And here I thought my money would have gone to waste.)

27
00:02:03,568 --> 00:02:05,997
(Tell him to do his best, Mirin.)

28
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,927
(And tell him to let me know if he needs any help,)

29
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:13,217
(both about business and his mother.)

30
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:14,208
Yes.

31
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:16,208
Thank you, Aunt Noi.

32
00:02:20,952 --> 00:02:21,840
Here.

33
00:02:21,857 --> 00:02:23,862
This is from the latest collection.

34
00:02:23,874 --> 00:02:26,099
I picked it out especially just for you, Sui.

35
00:02:26,635 --> 00:02:28,099
Thank you.

36
00:02:29,337 --> 00:02:31,628
Please look out for him.

37
00:02:31,642 --> 00:02:34,500
Chanon really is a hard working man.

38
00:02:35,256 --> 00:02:39,610
You always have something for us every time we meet, Sroyphet.

39
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:42,103
We're starting to feel like we're imposing.

40
00:02:42,205 --> 00:02:44,602
But we always take care of each other, don't we?

41
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:47,408
I'll support you in the meeting.

42
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:51,497
I've always preferred Chanon's management.

43
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:53,059
Thank you.

44
00:02:53,062 --> 00:02:53,914
Of course.

45
00:02:58,388 --> 00:03:00,108
Excuse me, but I am returning this.

46
00:03:02,656 --> 00:03:06,740
And excuse me for choosing to support whatever is best for the company,

47
00:03:07,514 --> 00:03:11,737
whether that person is Chanon or Veekit.

48
00:03:17,811 --> 00:03:19,600
You have two children, don't you?

49
00:03:21,054 --> 00:03:22,542
How is your financial situation?

50
00:03:23,325 --> 00:03:25,700
If you happened to lose your job today,

51
00:03:25,903 --> 00:03:26,794
would you say you have enough money

52
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:29,000
to pay for your children's education up to, say...

53
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:30,903
University?

54
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:36,062
I don't just invite anybody to tea.

55
00:03:36,077 --> 00:03:37,605
Don't turn me down.

56
00:03:38,128 --> 00:03:40,794
Please take the gift.

57
00:03:41,128 --> 00:03:42,862
In case you really do lose your job,

58
00:03:43,213 --> 00:03:45,257
you can still sell it to support your children.

59
00:03:48,481 --> 00:03:49,970
Then I'll take it.

60
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:55,703
And I'll do my best to support Chanon.

61
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,179
A smart decision.

62
00:04:01,503 --> 00:04:04,502
Feel free to let the staff know if you need anything else.

63
00:04:06,195 --> 00:04:07,408
Like I said,

64
00:04:07,934 --> 00:04:10,007
with your help,

65
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:14,017
I believe Next Innovation still has a long way to go.

66
00:04:15,328 --> 00:04:16,109
Thank you.

67
00:04:16,595 --> 00:04:17,850
My pleasure.

68
00:04:17,869 --> 00:04:19,014
Excuse me.

69
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,595
This way, please.

70
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:24,616
Please.

71
00:04:25,948 --> 00:04:27,333
- Please. - Thank you.

72
00:04:31,315 --> 00:04:33,703
Let's get down to business, shall we?

73
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,404
You said you were almost here, Mirin.

74
00:04:45,774 --> 00:04:48,005
Your "just a moment" and mine are definitely different, huh?

75
00:04:57,385 --> 00:04:58,402
You know what?

76
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,939
If you don't come here by the time I finish this,

77
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,579
I'm getting mad at you for real.

78
00:05:33,044 --> 00:05:33,911
Hey.

79
00:05:34,017 --> 00:05:35,654
I don't forgive easily, I'll have you know.

80
00:05:36,505 --> 00:05:37,800
Come back already.

81
00:05:50,533 --> 00:05:52,179
You're late, my heart.

82
00:05:55,007 --> 00:05:57,262
Mr. Vee, I can't breathe when you're squeezing my heart.

83
00:06:00,638 --> 00:06:04,205
How about I drop you off and pick you up from now on?

84
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,657
Save you the trouble, you know?

85
00:06:06,848 --> 00:06:08,474
Oh, please, you don't have to.

86
00:06:08,488 --> 00:06:11,143
I'm late because I talked to Big Noi.

87
00:06:11,155 --> 00:06:13,583
I told her you're ready to get back to work.

88
00:06:13,604 --> 00:06:16,577
Oh... What did Big Noi say?

89
00:06:17,767 --> 00:06:20,610
The first thing she said was...

90
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,365
"Finally!"

91
00:06:24,136 --> 00:06:27,314
And then she said you should tell her if you need help with anything,

92
00:06:27,325 --> 00:06:29,600
both about work and about Aunt Nee.

93
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,402
Well...

94
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,205
Can I get another hug?

95
00:06:41,103 --> 00:06:43,628
Quickly! We need to get back to work. Only one hug.

96
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,903
Okay.

97
00:06:47,896 --> 00:06:48,714
Wait.

98
00:06:49,444 --> 00:06:51,457
Let me stare at your face for a bit longer.

99
00:06:54,853 --> 00:06:58,700
I can finally see again so I gotta appreciate my girl's face.

100
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,988
Mr. Vee.

101
00:07:00,995 --> 00:07:01,903
What?

102
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:02,937
- Let's go. - Just a minute.

103
00:07:02,942 --> 00:07:04,174
Enough already.

104
00:07:04,183 --> 00:07:05,207
Come on.

105
00:07:16,198 --> 00:07:17,906
You want anything, baby?

106
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,176
Should we change the font here?

107
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:26,828
Here.

108
00:07:36,183 --> 00:07:37,583
Alright, Mr. Vee.

109
00:07:37,592 --> 00:07:39,204
That's enough now. Thank you.

110
00:07:51,564 --> 00:07:52,808
Mr. Vee.

111
00:07:53,293 --> 00:07:55,004
Can I ask you something?

112
00:07:57,404 --> 00:07:58,413
Sure.

113
00:08:01,365 --> 00:08:03,509
If you really have to go up against Mr. Chanon,

114
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:06,410
how will this end?

115
00:08:08,293 --> 00:08:10,617
Based solely on what you want, I mean.

116
00:08:11,287 --> 00:08:14,000
Don't think about any other possibilities for now.

117
00:08:14,964 --> 00:08:15,998
Well...

118
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,056
I'm asking because

119
00:08:20,275 --> 00:08:25,102
we don't know what kind of actions Mr. Chanon has already taken at Next.

120
00:08:26,761 --> 00:08:31,908
Most of the employees, even before this, have always rooted for him...

121
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,820
More than they do for you.

122
00:08:42,638 --> 00:08:45,601
I like having you by my side.

123
00:08:47,337 --> 00:08:49,820
Please, this is hardly the time for that.

124
00:08:52,577 --> 00:08:54,617
I like that you mean what you say

125
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,506
and that you say it with good intentions.

126
00:08:57,802 --> 00:08:59,628
I also happen to be very cool

127
00:09:00,687 --> 00:09:04,808
so I always take your cautious suggestions in stride.

128
00:09:06,322 --> 00:09:08,506
Mr. Vee, be serious.

129
00:09:08,722 --> 00:09:12,619
I'm asking because I'm really worried about you.

130
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,506
What will it be like if you must go up against your own cousin,

131
00:09:18,531 --> 00:09:19,659
where will it lead,

132
00:09:19,931 --> 00:09:21,810
and how will it end?

133
00:09:34,278 --> 00:09:36,819
The ending that I want to see is...

134
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:45,802
For whatever possessing Chanon to stop,

135
00:09:47,334 --> 00:09:48,820
and I get the old him back.

136
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,102
I want him to remember that

137
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:57,103
I never mean him any harm.

138
00:09:59,853 --> 00:10:01,739
I want him to remember

139
00:10:03,574 --> 00:10:06,097
what a kind man he truly is.

140
00:10:09,777 --> 00:10:11,906
I want to work with him again.

141
00:10:14,096 --> 00:10:15,300
Honestly, for him,

142
00:10:16,096 --> 00:10:20,638
I'll willingly give up the company.

143
00:10:24,908 --> 00:10:26,700
But if Non,

144
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:29,100
or Aunt Sroy,

145
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:34,514
wants to hurt my mother, or hurt you,

146
00:10:39,437 --> 00:10:42,001
I don't want to be someone who can't protect anyone.

147
00:10:44,534 --> 00:10:46,939
I'll give up everything they want me to,

148
00:10:47,511 --> 00:10:54,488
but I won't let anything hurt you or Mom.

149
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,176
I know Aunt Sroy.

150
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:09,103
She won't back down.

151
00:11:10,105 --> 00:11:11,608
I'm certain about one thing.

152
00:11:12,032 --> 00:11:13,909
If they win,

153
00:11:15,594 --> 00:11:18,017
they won't spare a loser like me anything.

154
00:11:20,395 --> 00:11:22,182
But I'll show them that

155
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:24,909
if I win,

156
00:11:26,562 --> 00:11:29,804
they will still have me as their family.

157
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,699
Hmm?

158
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:45,900
I'm really proud of you.

159
00:12:53,099 --> 00:12:54,105
Careful, please.

160
00:13:09,017 --> 00:13:10,808
You loved this place, you know that, Mom?

161
00:13:13,437 --> 00:13:14,260
I did?

162
00:13:15,354 --> 00:13:16,260
Yes.

163
00:13:20,154 --> 00:13:21,305
Over there.

164
00:13:25,173 --> 00:13:26,259
When I was a kid,

165
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:32,711
you once scolded me there for taking off without you.

166
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:36,605
You asked me

167
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:42,010
what you would ever do if I went missing.

168
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:48,204
You said you'd be devastated.

169
00:13:55,995 --> 00:14:01,020
After that, I never once ran off without you again.

170
00:14:06,343 --> 00:14:08,414
I was so afraid of hurting you.

171
00:14:18,154 --> 00:14:19,137
Mom.

172
00:14:24,462 --> 00:14:26,256
Please don't go away again.

173
00:14:29,457 --> 00:14:33,579
If you are gone again, I'll be devastated.

174
00:14:38,204 --> 00:14:39,911
Please stay with me, Mom.

175
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:10,411
(Next Innovation needs both Chanon and Veekit.)

176
00:15:12,225 --> 00:15:15,717
(Why didn't you look after Veekit today?)

177
00:15:19,497 --> 00:15:21,106
(You're the big brother here, Non.)

178
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:30,537
(I've been telling you all this time to take care of him.)

179
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,502
Hello, Grandpa.

180
00:15:55,786 --> 00:16:00,537
I know you're busy, but we can't wait any longer.

181
00:16:01,823 --> 00:16:05,001
Please attend the meeting at 11 o'clock today.

182
00:16:13,318 --> 00:16:14,608
Hello, Miss Eas?

183
00:16:15,788 --> 00:16:17,536
Please schedule a meeting for me.

184
00:16:18,469 --> 00:16:19,706
Today, at 11 o'clock.

185
00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:21,706
Thank you.

186
00:16:32,151 --> 00:16:33,705
Everything's ready on my end.

187
00:16:34,121 --> 00:16:37,100
Three people have promised to support you.

188
00:16:38,823 --> 00:16:39,517
Yes.

189
00:16:39,977 --> 00:16:41,457
Everything's all cleared on my end, too.

190
00:16:42,322 --> 00:16:47,508
All we need to know now is if Veekit is coming back to Next.

191
00:16:48,161 --> 00:16:49,139
No.

192
00:16:49,389 --> 00:16:51,002
Veekit can't come back.

193
00:16:51,494 --> 00:16:53,709
I'll close every door in his face.

194
00:16:53,853 --> 00:16:54,736
Don't worry.

195
00:17:56,037 --> 00:17:57,100
Sh—

196
00:17:58,905 --> 00:17:59,804
You lost?

197
00:18:00,266 --> 00:18:01,702
Why are you following me?

198
00:18:02,908 --> 00:18:03,580
Hey.

199
00:18:04,397 --> 00:18:06,019
I'm asking you why you're following me.

200
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:10,822
I... I've mistaken you for someone else.

201
00:18:17,608 --> 00:18:19,211
Thank you, you guys.

202
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,979
Was I intimidating enough just now?

203
00:18:21,478 --> 00:18:22,604
You were great.

204
00:18:22,927 --> 00:18:24,308
Yeah!

205
00:18:24,946 --> 00:18:26,583
Who is he, though?

206
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:28,613
I don't know.

207
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:30,506
But I've got a photo of him now.

208
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:32,257
We'll look out for you.

209
00:18:32,857 --> 00:18:33,915
Thank you.

210
00:18:34,392 --> 00:18:35,306
Of course.

211
00:18:44,309 --> 00:18:46,644
I'll be picking you up from now on.

212
00:18:46,653 --> 00:18:47,660
Do not refuse.

213
00:18:47,973 --> 00:18:50,306
Do you know how dangerous it is to be stalked like that?

214
00:18:50,317 --> 00:18:52,373
And you waited until you got here to tell me?

215
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:54,137
You should have called me right away!

216
00:18:54,277 --> 00:18:56,091
You were lucky there were some nice guys around.

217
00:18:56,108 --> 00:18:58,044
I dread to even think what would have happened otherwise.

218
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,417
You're the size of a chihuahua!

219
00:18:59,423 --> 00:19:01,228
You thought you could take him if he decided to attack?

220
00:19:01,235 --> 00:19:04,920
I'm buying you a whistle, a taser, and some pepper spray.

221
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:06,920
You're carrying all those on you at all times.

222
00:19:07,042 --> 00:19:09,260
Do you remember the guy's face?

223
00:19:11,848 --> 00:19:12,703
What?

224
00:19:13,065 --> 00:19:14,659
Why didn't you just tell me, you dork?

225
00:19:14,672 --> 00:19:16,408
Why'd you just let me stand here and ramble?

226
00:19:16,851 --> 00:19:18,653
Because you didn't even pause long enough for me to cut in.

227
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,779
You're fretting as much as a paranoid middle aged uncle, you know that?

228
00:19:20,786 --> 00:19:21,742
You're so ugly right now.

229
00:19:21,757 --> 00:19:23,663
You're so ugly when you're arguing with me.

230
00:19:23,672 --> 00:19:25,389
What? But you—

231
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,940
What would I do if anything happened to you?

232
00:19:44,031 --> 00:19:46,912
We need to find out who he is.

233
00:19:49,248 --> 00:19:54,317
What do you think he wants from me?

234
00:19:54,582 --> 00:19:57,607
Someone was spying on Aunt Nee before this, too.

235
00:19:57,831 --> 00:19:59,505
Who sent him?

236
00:20:01,561 --> 00:20:03,342
Do you think this has something to do with...

237
00:20:03,354 --> 00:20:04,800
...to do with Next.

238
00:20:06,734 --> 00:20:10,419
It might have something to do with Non, or Aunt Sroy.

239
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:18,202
If everyone knows where Mom is,

240
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,708
she'll be in danger.

241
00:20:25,887 --> 00:20:27,205
I'm going back to Next.

242
00:20:30,739 --> 00:20:31,582
But...

243
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,567
Mr. Vee.

244
00:20:33,579 --> 00:20:35,623
You're not ready. Your plan is still—

245
00:20:35,631 --> 00:20:37,216
If I keep hiding here,

246
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:39,771
it's you and Mom who will be at risk.

247
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,373
Then I'm coming with you.

248
00:20:47,225 --> 00:20:49,308
We need to make Mr. Non think that I'm still helping you out.

249
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,469
We can't let him find out that you can—

250
00:20:51,478 --> 00:20:52,607
That I can see now.

251
00:20:53,222 --> 00:20:54,208
Yes.

252
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:56,903
Good.

253
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,924
We might not be able to come up with a proper plan in time,

254
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,257
but it will make up for the fact that I can see now.

255
00:21:04,348 --> 00:21:05,610
Let me know how things turn out.

256
00:21:05,623 --> 00:21:06,502
Yes. Thank you.

257
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:08,794
Please.

258
00:21:08,802 --> 00:21:09,903
I'll see you in there.

259
00:21:10,874 --> 00:21:12,112
- Thank you. - I'll vote for you.

260
00:21:13,145 --> 00:21:14,110
Please.

261
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:20,011
How is it?

262
00:21:20,093 --> 00:21:21,309
Everything's alright?

263
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,007
90% of everyone in that room is on our team.

264
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:27,506
The other 10% is acting like they're not, just for fairness' sake.

265
00:21:28,811 --> 00:21:29,605
Cool.

266
00:21:30,582 --> 00:21:32,715
You're ready to invest, aren't you?

267
00:21:33,065 --> 00:21:35,706
The numbers might be higher than we originally thought.

268
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,306
That's not a problem.

269
00:21:38,826 --> 00:21:41,832
Whatever it takes to get rid of Veekit.

270
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:45,306
Shall we?

271
00:21:45,674 --> 00:21:46,613
After you.

272
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:58,100
Please.

273
00:22:20,551 --> 00:22:21,500
Hello.

274
00:22:22,171 --> 00:22:24,308
Thank you for coming.

275
00:22:24,894 --> 00:22:26,407
We have one agenda today.

276
00:22:26,985 --> 00:22:29,735
I would like to propose the dismissal of Veekit

277
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,914
as the Chief Executive of Next Innovation.

278
00:22:42,032 --> 00:22:43,401
I object.

279
00:22:50,137 --> 00:22:51,402
(I'm going back to Next.)

280
00:22:52,248 --> 00:22:57,211
I want to see the way each of them looks at me.

281
00:23:03,887 --> 00:23:08,416
(So that's how they have all been looking at me.)

282
00:23:16,794 --> 00:23:17,617
Vee.

283
00:23:22,694 --> 00:23:25,008
Granddad, may I?

284
00:23:25,475 --> 00:23:27,979
What are the reasons for this need to remove me from office?

285
00:23:33,774 --> 00:23:35,411
You abandoned the company.

286
00:23:36,937 --> 00:23:38,777
You come and go as you please.

287
00:23:39,121 --> 00:23:42,111
How can we leave our company to your immature whims?

288
00:23:42,794 --> 00:23:44,777
That is not enough reason.

289
00:23:45,459 --> 00:23:46,808
What about the revenue,

290
00:23:47,933 --> 00:23:49,339
and everything Veekit has done for us?

291
00:23:49,568 --> 00:23:51,205
Are we going to conveniently ignore that?

292
00:23:52,414 --> 00:23:54,139
If we're looking at it impartially,

293
00:23:55,349 --> 00:23:58,801
it's me who always makes sure we have successful turnovers.

294
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,456
But I'll keep it fair here, so...

295
00:24:03,102 --> 00:24:07,804
Does anyone want to give my Grandpa some more reasons?

296
00:24:12,008 --> 00:24:14,180
As a partner,

297
00:24:14,205 --> 00:24:17,825
I think Mr. Veekit's business approach is too self-indulgent.

298
00:24:17,894 --> 00:24:19,820
There were many occasions that I disagreed with him.

299
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:24,177
If it wasn't for Mr. Chanon, I would have left a long time ago.

300
00:24:24,675 --> 00:24:25,613
Thank you.

301
00:24:26,408 --> 00:24:27,776
I agree, Mr. Chanon.

302
00:24:29,567 --> 00:24:32,099
He never listens to anyone and is self-important,

303
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:37,259
even when the money is from various investors.

304
00:24:37,678 --> 00:24:39,899
Not to mention the incident from before

305
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,080
where his personal matters

306
00:24:41,105 --> 00:24:43,071
got in the way and he missed the press conference.

307
00:24:50,917 --> 00:24:54,540
Credibility is paramount for every investor.

308
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:57,420
But from what I heard,

309
00:24:57,445 --> 00:25:00,933
I don't think I'm ready to work with a CEO with such behavior.

310
00:25:03,204 --> 00:25:06,536
My investment isn't a small fee,

311
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:08,805
and I sure didn't mean for it to build a playground

312
00:25:08,866 --> 00:25:10,800
for a child like Veekit to run around in.

313
00:25:14,077 --> 00:25:17,336
As your major shareholder at the moment,

314
00:25:19,626 --> 00:25:24,210
I second this motion to remove Veekit from office

315
00:25:25,539 --> 00:25:27,702
and recommend Chanon as the new CEO.

316
00:25:28,758 --> 00:25:29,802
I second that.

317
00:25:29,949 --> 00:25:31,106
I also second that.

318
00:25:31,217 --> 00:25:32,213
I second that.

319
00:25:32,465 --> 00:25:33,188
I second that.

320
00:25:33,202 --> 00:25:34,013
I second that.

321
00:25:34,082 --> 00:25:34,832
I second that.

322
00:25:34,872 --> 00:25:36,528
I second that.

323
00:25:36,591 --> 00:25:37,422
I second that.

324
00:25:37,456 --> 00:25:38,414
I second that.

325
00:25:42,838 --> 00:25:45,402
What do you say, Dad?

326
00:25:49,248 --> 00:25:50,426
I also second the motion.

327
00:25:50,628 --> 00:25:51,702
What?

328
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:56,302
Is he voting himself out?

329
00:25:56,917 --> 00:26:01,500
If I must vote, I'd vote for Chanon.

330
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:11,508
Because I now understand what an awful CEO I have been.

331
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:14,611
If I were an application,

332
00:26:15,071 --> 00:26:17,499
I'd say I was an app where the program wasn't yet perfectly in place.

333
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:23,309
The first version of me might not be really good.

334
00:26:27,499 --> 00:26:30,339
But I am willing to receive all of your feedback.

335
00:26:31,151 --> 00:26:34,779
Even if some feedback is ridden with bias,

336
00:26:36,251 --> 00:26:37,605
like the one from Miss Tanya.

337
00:26:39,087 --> 00:26:42,611
Your feedback is very serious and thorough,

338
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,816
especially so, considering that we have never even once worked together.

339
00:26:49,269 --> 00:26:50,613
But then again,

340
00:26:50,721 --> 00:26:57,260
an application is often flawed and needs constant updates.

341
00:26:57,958 --> 00:26:59,659
So am I.

342
00:27:00,739 --> 00:27:04,503
I will keep improving into a better version of myself

343
00:27:04,863 --> 00:27:09,379
and become the Veekit that is good enough for everyone.

344
00:27:13,485 --> 00:27:14,677
But you're not ready to—

345
00:27:14,685 --> 00:27:16,656
Please have faith in me,

346
00:27:17,951 --> 00:27:22,619
the same way Big Noi still has faith enough to invest with me.

347
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,524
As a company, I'd like to ask you all

348
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:34,133
to consider a second chance for Veekit.

349
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:39,171
But you must prove yourself as soon as possible, Veekit.

350
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:44,016
I vote for Veekit.

351
00:27:45,127 --> 00:27:46,109
Me, too.

352
00:27:46,537 --> 00:27:47,414
I vote for Veekit.

353
00:27:51,998 --> 00:27:53,508
What about you, Mr. Kitdanai and the rest?

354
00:27:54,248 --> 00:27:55,576
Aren't you going to vote?

355
00:28:04,346 --> 00:28:05,256
Hold on.

356
00:28:06,666 --> 00:28:08,819
Are you sure this is how you want to play this?

357
00:28:14,654 --> 00:28:15,700
Dad.

358
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:18,265
Are you really going to let some pretty words

359
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:21,628
win over Chanon's 10-year determination?

360
00:28:23,379 --> 00:28:24,997
We can discuss this at home.

361
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:26,108
No, we can't!

362
00:28:27,837 --> 00:28:31,007
I won't allow you to overlook Chanon anymore.

363
00:28:32,259 --> 00:28:35,008
All one child does is talk, while another does all the work.

364
00:28:35,552 --> 00:28:37,656
One disappears and nearly ruins everything,

365
00:28:37,927 --> 00:28:39,601
while the other still does all the work.

366
00:28:40,496 --> 00:28:43,737
Even if a simple apology cuts it and all is easily forgiven,

367
00:28:44,182 --> 00:28:46,260
my son still has to do all the work.

368
00:28:47,345 --> 00:28:48,309
She's right.

369
00:28:50,213 --> 00:28:52,010
I've always been with Mr. Chanon.

370
00:28:52,499 --> 00:28:54,659
He barely has time for himself.

371
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:57,607
There's nothing he does for his own gain.

372
00:28:58,394 --> 00:29:01,402
Thank you, Miss Eas, Mrs. Sroyphet,

373
00:29:03,703 --> 00:29:05,106
for speaking up for me.

374
00:29:09,361 --> 00:29:11,706
But we will heed my Grandpa's advice

375
00:29:13,509 --> 00:29:15,111
and see if this company rots,

376
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,017
crumbles,

377
00:29:18,151 --> 00:29:19,207
and falls apart

378
00:29:22,968 --> 00:29:24,625
from the inside out.

379
00:29:28,041 --> 00:29:31,420
Maybe then you will come crawling back, begging me to fix it.

380
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:03,500
Please be assured that this will be Veekit's only chance.

381
00:30:04,512 --> 00:30:08,005
If he can make good on his promise,

382
00:30:08,533 --> 00:30:10,177
including the matter with Big Noi,

383
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,700
Veekit will continue to manage this company.

384
00:30:13,112 --> 00:30:15,100
Thank you for coming today.

385
00:30:16,434 --> 00:30:17,559
I hope you all continue

386
00:30:17,584 --> 00:30:19,918
to support this company to the best of your ability.

387
00:30:33,444 --> 00:30:35,422
Veekit, stay and talk to me.

388
00:30:37,254 --> 00:30:38,311
Wait outside.

389
00:30:38,982 --> 00:30:39,807
Yes.

390
00:30:46,481 --> 00:30:47,420
Yes?

391
00:30:51,505 --> 00:30:53,339
I'm sick of this meeting room.

392
00:30:55,408 --> 00:30:56,742
I understand.

393
00:31:00,245 --> 00:31:03,308
It's been over 30 years. I long for a rest.

394
00:31:05,642 --> 00:31:08,004
Now, why don't you go take a walk with me?

395
00:31:33,456 --> 00:31:34,694
Where have you been?

396
00:31:36,788 --> 00:31:38,305
I'm really sorry, Granddad.

397
00:31:39,167 --> 00:31:40,607
I...

398
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,205
You found your mother?

399
00:31:44,404 --> 00:31:45,805
You knew?

400
00:31:48,019 --> 00:31:51,807
You disappeared with those photos that day.

401
00:31:52,395 --> 00:31:54,983
Those photos of Neeraaumpan and...

402
00:31:54,992 --> 00:31:56,108
Mirin.

403
00:31:56,797 --> 00:31:58,108
Her name is Mirin.

404
00:31:59,343 --> 00:32:03,897
Mirin is the one who has been taking care of Mom all this time.

405
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:05,897
How is your mother?

406
00:32:08,005 --> 00:32:09,602
She has Alzheimer's.

407
00:32:11,348 --> 00:32:15,605
She knew her condition was deteriorating.

408
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,977
She thought it might be for the best if she disappeared.

409
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:25,694
It was always hard on her to stay

410
00:32:25,719 --> 00:32:28,637
in our house all alone without your father.

411
00:32:32,088 --> 00:32:34,294
I'm taking care of her right now.

412
00:32:35,002 --> 00:32:39,411
All these years, you've been looking out for me

413
00:32:40,423 --> 00:32:43,795
because I don't have both my father and mother.

414
00:32:45,028 --> 00:32:46,859
I know it must have been tiring for you

415
00:32:48,488 --> 00:32:53,417
while all I did was blindly ask myself why my mother abandoned me.

416
00:32:55,878 --> 00:32:57,502
But I understand now.

417
00:32:59,001 --> 00:33:00,004
Granddad.

418
00:33:01,102 --> 00:33:02,210
From now on,

419
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:08,208
I'll do everything for Next, and for you.

420
00:33:16,245 --> 00:33:18,097
You can see now?

421
00:33:18,792 --> 00:33:20,148
I'm happy for you.

422
00:33:20,168 --> 00:33:21,204
I can.

423
00:33:42,026 --> 00:33:43,897
Whatever you're planning,

424
00:33:44,044 --> 00:33:47,204
I'll warn you that it won't be easy.

425
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:54,607
I don't know why you want to steal Veekit away.

426
00:33:54,921 --> 00:33:57,311
Maybe because he's good-looking, or because he's rich,

427
00:33:57,579 --> 00:33:59,863
or you want to leech off of him for the rest of your life.

428
00:34:00,715 --> 00:34:02,499
It won't be as simple as you hope.

429
00:34:02,906 --> 00:34:05,297
Please keep your delusions to yourself.

430
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:07,499
Because there is no way we're thinking the same thing.

431
00:34:10,908 --> 00:34:11,808
Don't you dare.

432
00:34:12,444 --> 00:34:13,808
If you want a fight,

433
00:34:13,816 --> 00:34:15,205
I'm not one to back down.

434
00:34:15,862 --> 00:34:17,980
I'm only trying to be respectful of this workplace.

435
00:34:18,402 --> 00:34:20,324
Why don't you try and act half as noble

436
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:22,086
as the clothes you're wearing for once?

437
00:34:24,374 --> 00:34:25,401
Hey!

438
00:34:30,825 --> 00:34:35,506
When she started to remember me, she called out my name.

439
00:34:37,078 --> 00:34:39,401
After that, I slowly gained my sight back.

440
00:34:41,225 --> 00:34:45,582
The doctor did say it was caused by emotional distress.

441
00:34:46,866 --> 00:34:48,717
But now that I can see again,

442
00:34:53,208 --> 00:34:55,060
it just makes me feel really bad.

443
00:34:57,182 --> 00:35:02,005
I can see the way Non, Aunt Sroy,

444
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:05,257
and all those people

445
00:35:06,669 --> 00:35:08,410
who look at me like they don't like me at all.

446
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,057
Unlike you.

447
00:35:10,881 --> 00:35:13,405
Chanon hasn't always looked at you that way.

448
00:35:14,555 --> 00:35:18,102
It's my fault for turning him into this.

449
00:35:20,296 --> 00:35:22,205
He must have been really disappointed today.

450
00:35:22,958 --> 00:35:24,503
I just want him to understand.

451
00:35:25,712 --> 00:35:26,804
Sroyphet, too.

452
00:35:27,714 --> 00:35:29,623
She must have put that thought in her son's head

453
00:35:31,075 --> 00:35:37,408
because she also believes I don't love her or care for her.

454
00:35:40,157 --> 00:35:41,622
I'll try to talk to them.

455
00:35:42,081 --> 00:35:43,622
Maybe things will get better.

456
00:35:45,066 --> 00:35:45,909
Yes.

457
00:35:48,349 --> 00:35:52,462
From here on out, it's all up to you how you deal with it.

458
00:35:53,158 --> 00:35:57,808
About work, your mother, and Chanon.

459
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,457
I hope everything turns out alright.

460
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:08,062
No matter what happens, you two are like brothers to each other.

461
00:36:10,205 --> 00:36:11,109
Yes.

462
00:36:11,645 --> 00:36:13,340
Let me know if you need help with your mother.

463
00:36:14,321 --> 00:36:17,608
Once everything is settled down, I'd love to meet her.

464
00:36:18,598 --> 00:36:20,540
Even if she doesn't remember me.

465
00:36:22,915 --> 00:36:23,807
Yes.

466
00:36:24,195 --> 00:36:25,988
I won't disappoint you, Granddad.

467
00:36:28,066 --> 00:36:28,897
Good.

468
00:36:29,671 --> 00:36:30,512
Very good.

469
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,982
They are all traitors!

470
00:36:35,995 --> 00:36:37,605
We should fire all of them.

471
00:36:42,893 --> 00:36:46,619
Isn't it strange that Veekit chose today of all day to come back here?

472
00:36:48,804 --> 00:36:51,617
What if he already found Neeraaumpan?

473
00:36:51,951 --> 00:36:53,706
If he did find her,

474
00:36:54,911 --> 00:36:57,002
that means he doesn't have any more weaknesses.

475
00:36:58,524 --> 00:37:00,856
It seems he's really ready to come back.

476
00:37:01,377 --> 00:37:06,777
I can tell from his gesture that he's down for a fight now.

477
00:37:08,437 --> 00:37:09,862
We need to find another way.

478
00:37:11,765 --> 00:37:13,697
Everyone might have voted for Veekit,

479
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:17,216
but I noticed that some of them only did it for Mr. Prapob.

480
00:37:18,718 --> 00:37:20,445
The look on their faces was obvious

481
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:22,083
they don't even trust Veekit anymore.

482
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:24,459
You're right.

483
00:37:25,764 --> 00:37:28,100
The only reason he has the nerve to stay

484
00:37:28,125 --> 00:37:30,037
is because he can't see their faces.

485
00:37:34,724 --> 00:37:35,580
Non.

486
00:37:35,733 --> 00:37:37,508
I think we still have a chance.

487
00:37:37,602 --> 00:37:40,376
We have to do whatever it takes to get rid of Veekit now.

488
00:37:52,331 --> 00:37:53,204
Hold on.

489
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:56,305
There's a programmer on your side.

490
00:37:57,068 --> 00:37:57,909
Manit?

491
00:37:58,305 --> 00:37:59,010
Yes.

492
00:37:59,465 --> 00:38:01,407
Tell him to come see me as soon as possible.

493
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,090
What are you planning to do?

494
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:09,598
Trust me, Non.

495
00:38:09,968 --> 00:38:11,619
You don't need to know this.

496
00:38:12,078 --> 00:38:14,508
Just tell him to meet me.

497
00:38:22,394 --> 00:38:24,539
I'll count on you and Tanya to take care of business.

498
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:28,180
I'll see what else I can do about Neeraaumpan.

499
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:32,419
I think there's a big chance Mirin is her minion.

500
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,004
Mirin?

501
00:38:35,561 --> 00:38:37,780
I don't think she has anything to do with this.

502
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,380
I know her.

503
00:38:39,715 --> 00:38:40,346
She's not someone who—

504
00:38:40,354 --> 00:38:41,660
Are you defending her?

505
00:38:43,568 --> 00:38:44,940
Do you like her?

506
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,607
I already asked Kem to keep an eye on Mirin.

507
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,807
What?

508
00:38:54,948 --> 00:38:55,807
Why?

509
00:38:56,647 --> 00:38:57,220
Mom—

510
00:38:57,232 --> 00:39:01,619
Because I know she definitely knows where Neeraaumpan is.

511
00:39:02,171 --> 00:39:03,234
You stay out of this.

512
00:39:03,245 --> 00:39:04,500
I'll deal with it.

513
00:39:04,786 --> 00:39:05,602
Mom.

514
00:39:06,645 --> 00:39:08,711
Just please don't hurt Mirin.

515
00:39:08,794 --> 00:39:09,684
Chanon!

516
00:39:09,697 --> 00:39:10,659
Mom!

517
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,139
Don't get someone else involved in this.

518
00:39:13,487 --> 00:39:15,502
This is between me and Veekit.

519
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,016
Then, this is between Neeraaumpan and me.

520
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:21,007
If she comes back,

521
00:39:21,422 --> 00:39:24,542
she is to inherit all of Veekit's father's fortune.

522
00:39:24,552 --> 00:39:26,336
We will only be further away from everything.

523
00:39:26,666 --> 00:39:30,297
I don't want you to do something you shouldn't.

524
00:39:32,522 --> 00:39:34,205
Let me handle this.

525
00:39:35,088 --> 00:39:36,019
Please.

526
00:39:36,518 --> 00:39:39,208
You and I have been overlooked all this time, Non.

527
00:39:39,512 --> 00:39:42,460
How can I let you do this alone?

528
00:39:45,845 --> 00:39:47,902
Just get Manit to meet Tanya like she asked.

529
00:39:49,013 --> 00:39:50,939
We don't have time to be arguing like this.

530
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,002
Here it is.

531
00:40:27,463 --> 00:40:28,708
Smells great, doesn't it?

532
00:40:30,474 --> 00:40:31,708
Dig in.

533
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,616
Thanks.

534
00:40:35,837 --> 00:40:37,005
Something on your mind?

535
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,297
You look out of it.

536
00:40:39,499 --> 00:40:40,302
Do I?

537
00:40:40,437 --> 00:40:41,097
Yeah.

538
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,811
I don't know.

539
00:40:43,783 --> 00:40:47,108
I'm just wondering if I have to go on living like this forever.

540
00:40:49,345 --> 00:40:51,460
No career growth, just the same as always.

541
00:40:52,176 --> 00:40:55,059
It's not bad, but it's getting boring.

542
00:40:56,082 --> 00:40:58,460
I don't know what I need in life.

543
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:01,402
What are you even saying?

544
00:41:01,832 --> 00:41:02,899
I don't get it.

545
00:41:05,207 --> 00:41:08,140
Well, do you know what you want in life?

546
00:41:09,343 --> 00:41:10,198
Nope.

547
00:41:11,859 --> 00:41:13,000
I just want to eat good food like this

548
00:41:13,025 --> 00:41:14,526
every day for the rest of my life.

549
00:41:15,662 --> 00:41:16,602
It's good.

550
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:25,604
Yes?

551
00:41:27,308 --> 00:41:28,211
Me?

552
00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:30,334
Yes.

553
00:41:30,813 --> 00:41:31,933
Of course.

554
00:41:32,659 --> 00:41:33,602
Alright.

555
00:41:34,906 --> 00:41:35,903
I'll see you.

556
00:41:36,311 --> 00:41:37,656
Yes. Goodbye.

557
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,300
What is it?

558
00:41:50,109 --> 00:41:51,317
Hello, Miss Tanya.

559
00:41:51,576 --> 00:41:52,697
You wanted to see me?

560
00:41:52,995 --> 00:41:53,902
Yes.

561
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:54,955
Sit down.

562
00:41:57,733 --> 00:42:00,499
What is it? Why did you have Mr. Chanon call me?

563
00:42:01,078 --> 00:42:06,500
I want to know if we have any application that collects users' data.

564
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:08,000
We do.

565
00:42:08,761 --> 00:42:13,700
Normally, every application collects users' basic information.

566
00:42:14,851 --> 00:42:16,805
Name, phone number, and email.

567
00:42:17,311 --> 00:42:20,179
Some also collect their password and address.

568
00:42:22,308 --> 00:42:23,314
Well,

569
00:42:24,477 --> 00:42:27,008
would it be difficult to...

570
00:42:27,598 --> 00:42:29,008
leak those data?

571
00:42:32,097 --> 00:42:36,420
What if I, as the major shareholder of this company,

572
00:42:37,872 --> 00:42:40,509
want thousands of users' data leaked?

573
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:43,810
Will that be possible?

574
00:43:28,586 --> 00:43:30,204
You found Aunt Nee?

575
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:33,697
Do you really want to know?

576
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:37,903
The whole company has been waiting for you.

577
00:43:38,379 --> 00:43:40,899
Of course I really want to know if it's finally over.

578
00:43:41,251 --> 00:43:42,404
So, did you find her?

579
00:43:42,952 --> 00:43:44,816
Did you finally fix your mommy issues?

580
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:47,946
What kind of man

581
00:43:47,971 --> 00:43:51,443
uses other people's mommy issue just so he can get a little spotlight?

582
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:56,019
Amazing work. Just amazing.

583
00:43:57,174 --> 00:44:00,822
When will you understand that she abandoned you?

584
00:44:02,939 --> 00:44:05,580
Is that the only button you know to press?

585
00:44:06,124 --> 00:44:06,906
Look.

586
00:44:07,942 --> 00:44:10,699
You've never heard me bring up how Granddad doesn't want you

587
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,005
or how the company never appreciates you, have you?

588
00:44:18,539 --> 00:44:19,425
Vee!

589
00:44:19,733 --> 00:44:20,715
Non!

590
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:50,515
You honestly didn't have to do any of this.

591
00:44:51,368 --> 00:44:52,708
It's just a company.

592
00:44:55,682 --> 00:44:56,696
"Just a company"?

593
00:45:01,225 --> 00:45:04,299
For you, it is just a company.

594
00:45:05,103 --> 00:45:06,700
You never have to try so hard for it.

595
00:45:07,648 --> 00:45:12,102
But for me, it's my life's work.

596
00:45:12,678 --> 00:45:15,222
I have to study hard, work hard,

597
00:45:15,597 --> 00:45:18,214
take care of this silly brat all the time

598
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:20,123
just to get a little approval from Grandpa.

599
00:45:21,856 --> 00:45:23,189
You can't see, can you?

600
00:45:25,034 --> 00:45:28,819
But do you know what it's like not being seen?

601
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,811
It's exhausting.

602
00:45:34,927 --> 00:45:36,309
Freaking exhausting!

603
00:45:38,774 --> 00:45:39,699
V		Well, then.

604
00:45:40,693 --> 00:45:42,817
If you're so sick of it all,

605
00:45:44,503 --> 00:45:45,734
just take it.

606
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:47,908
I really believe it.

607
00:45:48,148 --> 00:45:49,939
I really believe you can do it.

608
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:51,902
But please,

609
00:45:53,312 --> 00:45:55,416
just don't get my loved ones involved.

610
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:57,502
Leave my mother out of this.

611
00:45:58,170 --> 00:45:59,602
Leave Mirin out of this.

612
00:46:01,047 --> 00:46:05,576
Don't hurt other people just because you're hurt.

613
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:37,050
Directed by Ekkasit Trakulkasemsuk and Pantip Vibultham

614
00:46:38,902 --> 00:46:40,001
You done?

615
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:41,905
Make sure the data that gets out

616
00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:44,284
is only the one under Veekit's responsibility.

617
00:46:51,536 --> 00:46:52,308
Hey.

618
00:46:54,471 --> 00:46:56,200
Are we really doing this?

619
00:46:58,654 --> 00:47:02,302
It's an order from the major shareholder, best friend of the future CEO.

620
00:47:02,761 --> 00:47:03,690
What do you think?

621
00:47:21,906 --> 00:47:24,461
This mistake really happened under my watch.

622
00:47:24,486 --> 00:47:25,388
Excuse me! Let me through!

623
00:47:25,413 --> 00:47:29,977
I might not be able to trace where that mistake is rooting from for now,

624
00:47:29,991 --> 00:47:31,577
but I'll take full responsibility.

625
00:47:31,591 --> 00:47:33,167
This could hurt the company.

626
00:47:33,177 --> 00:47:34,608
The very company I've been building.

627
00:47:34,694 --> 00:47:38,718
Then why don't you rebuild it from scratch?

628
00:47:38,962 --> 00:47:42,804
For everybody's sake, I'll resign
