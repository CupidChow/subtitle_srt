1
00:00:01,339 --> 00:00:02,377
Here.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,709
What is special about this cake?

3
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:08,604
This cake is made by Veekit.

4
00:00:12,152 --> 00:00:14,379
Get me information about Veekit's new secretary.

5
00:00:14,684 --> 00:00:16,402
What I want to know the most

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,050
is who gave her the name, Neeraaumpan.

7
00:00:20,974 --> 00:00:22,906
Aunt Noi is Big Noi!

8
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,007
Why?

9
00:00:24,229 --> 00:00:26,010
If I were Big Noi, what would you do?

10
00:00:26,296 --> 00:00:26,976
Okay.

11
00:00:26,989 --> 00:00:30,807
We will create a perfect and flawless business plan.

12
00:00:30,902 --> 00:00:34,142
Now, Veekit won't be in trouble because of me anymore.

13
00:00:34,598 --> 00:00:36,205
Does Big Noi really exist?

14
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,407
I think the numbers here should be bigger.

15
00:00:43,702 --> 00:00:45,102
She's up there in age.

16
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,699
We don't want her squinting.

17
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:50,611
Try changing the color here to make it look more eye-catching.

18
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:52,140
Nothing too flashy, though.

19
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,342
(When he's all serious at work like this,)

20
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:58,008
(he's so cool.)

21
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:01,140
(And he seems really kind.)

22
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,619
(What he showed before now must be a thick wall)

23
00:01:06,644 --> 00:01:08,527
(he put up to protect himself.)

24
00:01:09,164 --> 00:01:12,537
(Finally I got to learn that he's actually very gent—)

25
00:01:16,502 --> 00:01:17,805
Are you listening?

26
00:01:19,703 --> 00:01:20,503
Yes.

27
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:21,912
Of course.

28
00:01:22,197 --> 00:01:25,182
You want it a little flashy.

29
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:30,816
I said...

30
00:01:31,835 --> 00:01:32,816
Nothing.

31
00:01:34,128 --> 00:01:35,306
Too flashy.

32
00:01:41,349 --> 00:01:42,417
Y–Yes.

33
00:01:42,589 --> 00:01:43,608
I heard it now.

34
00:01:51,352 --> 00:01:53,130
(Can you not get so close?)

35
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:55,130
(I'm going to faint.)

36
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,737
What are you thinking?

37
00:02:00,097 --> 00:02:03,062
Uh, I'm thinking you're being too close.

38
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:12,337
Do I disgust you?

39
00:02:13,915 --> 00:02:15,117
It's not like that.

40
00:02:15,392 --> 00:02:16,352
You—

41
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:22,222
You're making me blush.

42
00:02:23,419 --> 00:02:24,222
Blush?

43
00:02:25,088 --> 00:02:26,220
Yes.

44
00:02:26,364 --> 00:02:30,980
I think that we just started working together,

45
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,977
and I'm not used to...

46
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,502
Being so close?

47
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:38,494
Yes.

48
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,708
I see.

49
00:02:41,736 --> 00:02:45,211
But how can I be sure that you're actually blushing

50
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:46,703
and not disgusted by me?

51
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,337
You can't tell from my face?

52
00:03:20,274 --> 00:03:20,974
Hey—

53
00:03:20,991 --> 00:03:21,860
Stay still.

54
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,820
Your cheeks really are burning.

55
00:03:46,176 --> 00:03:48,056
Of course they are.

56
00:03:48,074 --> 00:03:49,410
Why would I lie?

57
00:03:51,183 --> 00:03:52,939
Hey, where are you going?

58
00:03:54,783 --> 00:03:56,294
I...

59
00:03:57,813 --> 00:03:59,019
I need some water.

60
00:04:01,362 --> 00:04:02,506
We have some right here.

61
00:04:03,918 --> 00:04:05,103
I mean...

62
00:04:06,564 --> 00:04:08,182
I need something fresh.

63
00:04:10,798 --> 00:04:11,711
Got it.

64
00:04:12,077 --> 00:04:13,711
I've got just what you need.

65
00:04:16,997 --> 00:04:17,789
Here.

66
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,205
It'll freshen you right—

67
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:20,822
Oh?

68
00:04:22,459 --> 00:04:23,605
What is she, a witch?

69
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:24,800
Didn't know she could vanish like that.

70
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,128
It's really fresh, huh?

71
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,170
Jirawat Sutivanichsak

72
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,490

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,770

Directed by Ekkasit Trakulkasemsuk and Pantip Vibultham

77
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,050
I LIKE IT WHEN YOU BLUSH.

78
00:06:18,896 --> 00:06:20,106
Big Noi?

79
00:06:20,312 --> 00:06:21,130
Yes.

80
00:06:22,154 --> 00:06:26,539
I heard Mirin say Veekit got in contact with Big Noi.

81
00:06:27,111 --> 00:06:29,739
Don't tell me you actually believe in this Big Noi nonsense.

82
00:06:30,124 --> 00:06:30,939
Mom.

83
00:06:31,565 --> 00:06:34,820
Grandpa mentioned this person once at a party a long time ago.

84
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,219
Veekit was there, too.

85
00:06:37,568 --> 00:06:41,220
Grandpa said Veekit was with him when they met Big Noi.

86
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:47,019
I've been hearing your grandfather talk about this for decades.

87
00:06:47,497 --> 00:06:50,017
But I quite believe he was just prattling.

88
00:06:50,829 --> 00:06:53,405
Because no one has ever met this Big Noi person.

89
00:06:54,219 --> 00:06:56,062
There's no investment history.

90
00:06:56,238 --> 00:06:57,942
He doesn't attend parties, and no interviews.

91
00:06:58,256 --> 00:07:02,416
Why would an investor keep a low profile when he's so famous?

92
00:07:06,674 --> 00:07:09,142
Tanya is the best option. Trust me.

93
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:15,502
She's got money and a strong backup, not to mention her connection.

94
00:07:17,047 --> 00:07:18,408
Just leave Veekit be.

95
00:07:18,425 --> 00:07:20,601
If he thinks he can get that Big Noi on board,

96
00:07:20,995 --> 00:07:24,103
I believe when your Grandpa calls for a meeting,

97
00:07:24,256 --> 00:07:25,743
we'll all have a good laugh.

98
00:07:31,294 --> 00:07:32,864
You just need to prepare

99
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:35,123
a great business plan and give a good presentation.

100
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:39,807
Show Grandpa that you've never made one wrong move.

101
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,177
Okay?

102
00:07:42,413 --> 00:07:43,582
Trust me, baby.

103
00:07:56,367 --> 00:07:59,105
How could there be nothing at all on this person?

104
00:08:03,142 --> 00:08:05,801
Maybe Grandpa really was just prattling like Mom said?

105
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:14,939
What do you mean when you say "there's nothing on him"?

106
00:08:16,795 --> 00:08:17,604
Yes.

107
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,300
Yes, of course.

108
00:08:19,888 --> 00:08:21,010
I'll keep you updated.

109
00:08:21,351 --> 00:08:22,505
Yes. Goodbye.

110
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,200
What is it?

111
00:08:25,647 --> 00:08:26,620
Are we looking for someone?

112
00:08:27,765 --> 00:08:28,819
You need my help with it?

113
00:08:29,266 --> 00:08:30,170
That's up my alley.

114
00:08:30,579 --> 00:08:34,201
Mr. Chanon is looking for an investor who goes by Big Noi.

115
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:36,462
But there's nothing on him.

116
00:08:37,108 --> 00:08:38,859
Only "Big Noi, the investor."

117
00:08:39,294 --> 00:08:40,490
Can we really find someone like that?

118
00:08:41,881 --> 00:08:43,309
I can think of something.

119
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,712
It'll be difficult, though.

120
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:46,257
But I think I can do it.

121
00:08:48,407 --> 00:08:49,408
Good.

122
00:08:49,918 --> 00:08:50,761
Listen.

123
00:08:50,782 --> 00:08:52,819
Whatever Mr. Chanon wants, just get right to it.

124
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:57,697
I believe this guy is going to be the next CEO one day.

125
00:08:57,859 --> 00:08:58,500
What?

126
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,801
What about Mr. Veekit?

127
00:09:01,619 --> 00:09:02,604
Not a chance.

128
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,057
Too childish.

129
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,007
He's only here because his grandfather favors him.

130
00:09:07,602 --> 00:09:09,300
But he's self-centered and careless.

131
00:09:09,428 --> 00:09:11,622
He comes and goes as he pleases.

132
00:09:12,872 --> 00:09:16,699
Believe me, Maewkwak, Mr. Chanon is the right guy to get behind.

133
00:09:17,911 --> 00:09:18,651
Then I'm with you.

134
00:09:18,668 --> 00:09:20,462
That's more like it.

135
00:09:21,282 --> 00:09:22,202
Cheers.

136
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,543
Can you please take a look at this slide?

137
00:09:49,426 --> 00:09:51,216
I want the font to be a little bigger.

138
00:09:51,914 --> 00:09:53,306
Would 40 points be enough?

139
00:09:53,973 --> 00:09:54,939
Too big?

140
00:09:55,902 --> 00:09:57,340
Let's try 40.

141
00:10:03,974 --> 00:10:06,182
Mirin, I think we should adjust—

142
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,296
If I could only see the way you smile,

143
00:11:29,493 --> 00:11:30,903
it would be nice.

144
00:12:16,845 --> 00:12:18,905
If he could see my smile...?

145
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,099
If he could see?

146
00:12:24,189 --> 00:12:25,537
Am I not usually smiling?

147
00:12:32,262 --> 00:12:33,208
Where are you going?

148
00:12:34,957 --> 00:12:37,007
Oh, hello, Mr. Non.

149
00:12:37,245 --> 00:12:39,060
I'm on my way to—

150
00:12:43,349 --> 00:12:45,607
I'm going outside with Mr. Vee.

151
00:12:46,746 --> 00:12:47,600
Ah.

152
00:12:50,631 --> 00:12:51,905
Do you need help with that?

153
00:12:53,389 --> 00:12:54,622
It's alright. I can take it.

154
00:12:55,214 --> 00:12:56,269
Can you?

155
00:12:56,287 --> 00:12:57,939
Do you plan to keep carrying all that

156
00:12:59,241 --> 00:13:00,700
when Veekit hasn't left his house?

157
00:13:01,217 --> 00:13:01,897
What?

158
00:13:02,146 --> 00:13:03,099
He can't do that.

159
00:13:03,134 --> 00:13:05,496
This is very important. We can't be late!

160
00:13:05,737 --> 00:13:07,100
Big Noi only has—

161
00:13:21,488 --> 00:13:22,508
I was joking.

162
00:13:22,617 --> 00:13:24,000
Veekit is on his way here.

163
00:13:25,143 --> 00:13:26,508
Mr. Chanon!

164
00:13:27,081 --> 00:13:28,758
It's always fun messing with you.

165
00:13:28,771 --> 00:13:29,663
You'll believe anything

166
00:13:29,681 --> 00:13:31,377
Give me back my binders.

167
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:33,102
Give me.

168
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,299
What's this?

169
00:13:35,305 --> 00:13:36,205
You made this?

170
00:13:36,481 --> 00:13:38,066
Yes. I made it at home.

171
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,106
So it's homemade?

172
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,142
- Yes. - You're amazing.

173
00:13:40,456 --> 00:13:42,404
My family bakes for a living.

174
00:13:42,915 --> 00:13:43,906
Are we ready to go?

175
00:13:46,097 --> 00:13:47,007
Yes.

176
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:48,420
Then why aren't you in the car?

177
00:13:57,734 --> 00:13:59,542
This secretary is quite alright, isn't she?

178
00:14:00,034 --> 00:14:01,936
Makes you take your job seriously.

179
00:14:03,925 --> 00:14:07,002
Did you think I've been playing around all this time

180
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,601
as my company rose to its current glory?

181
00:14:11,911 --> 00:14:13,041
Excuse me.

182
00:14:13,555 --> 00:14:15,019
I don't have much time.

183
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,610
Do you mean Big Noi doesn't have much time?

184
00:14:23,354 --> 00:14:24,780
How did you know?

185
00:14:26,605 --> 00:14:27,805
Did you get it out of Mirin?

186
00:14:27,964 --> 00:14:30,019
No way. What do you mean?

187
00:14:30,281 --> 00:14:32,419
I was just making small talk.

188
00:14:34,685 --> 00:14:36,602
Leave my secretary alone.

189
00:14:39,093 --> 00:14:40,404
I never bother Aew-eas.

190
00:14:40,934 --> 00:14:43,481
I never ask her what you're doing or where you are.

191
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,998
So... leave Mirin alone.

192
00:14:46,056 --> 00:14:47,099
Hold up.

193
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,703
Are you so worked up about the possibility of leaking data

194
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,311
or losing your secretary?

195
00:15:00,103 --> 00:15:01,300
Both.

196
00:15:19,834 --> 00:15:21,705
Uh, Mr. Vee.

197
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:25,607
Mr. Chanon asked me about our investor, and I let slip that—

198
00:15:25,614 --> 00:15:26,783
Where exactly are we going?

199
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,546
Big Noi just sent us her location.

200
00:15:30,558 --> 00:15:32,115
We'll be there in 30 minutes.

201
00:15:33,588 --> 00:15:34,591
Mr. Vee—

202
00:15:34,605 --> 00:15:37,300
I don't care what you and my cousin talk about.

203
00:15:38,161 --> 00:15:40,143
Make small talks about the weather and the likes if you want.

204
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,204
But when it comes to work,

205
00:15:42,954 --> 00:15:44,816
you are not allowed to say anything.

206
00:15:45,162 --> 00:15:45,988
But...

207
00:15:46,001 --> 00:15:47,309
Drive fast.

208
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:48,607
I don't want to be late.

209
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,903
He's one of the executives.

210
00:16:06,168 --> 00:16:08,405
If he talks to me, I have no choice but to respond.

211
00:16:10,241 --> 00:16:12,142
I really didn't mean to—

212
00:16:12,152 --> 00:16:15,422
I told you I don't care if it's not about work.

213
00:16:16,914 --> 00:16:18,303
Don't talk to me anymore.

214
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:21,002
I'm trying to stay focused for the presentation.

215
00:16:23,037 --> 00:16:24,451
I'm sorry, Mr. Vee.

216
00:16:39,235 --> 00:16:41,708
Hello, Big Noi.

217
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,257
Hello.

218
00:16:48,272 --> 00:16:49,211
I'm Veekit.

219
00:16:52,134 --> 00:16:55,543
Are the brownies supposed to be a bribe?

220
00:16:56,591 --> 00:16:58,414
Oh, of course not.

221
00:16:58,546 --> 00:17:03,100
I came up with a new recipe and thought I might let you try, Big Noi.

222
00:17:04,325 --> 00:17:05,502
Just call me how you always call me.

223
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:07,139
You're giving me the creeps.

224
00:17:08,585 --> 00:17:10,463
Well, just say what you're here to say.

225
00:17:10,482 --> 00:17:12,402
We've already wasted several minutes.

226
00:17:12,641 --> 00:17:13,413
Right.

227
00:17:13,527 --> 00:17:17,503
We want to make an application that helps people with disabilities.

228
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:20,862
You lost me right off the hook.

229
00:17:23,118 --> 00:17:25,821
Is the term "people with disabilities"

230
00:17:25,846 --> 00:17:27,563
supposed to be worth my investment?

231
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,936
Uh...

232
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:33,256
Well, then.

233
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,062
Goodbye.

234
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,109
Let's not waste any more time.

235
00:17:38,431 --> 00:17:39,705
I'm not interested.

236
00:17:43,278 --> 00:17:44,942
You can't do that.

237
00:17:45,228 --> 00:17:46,703
You can't.

238
00:17:48,195 --> 00:17:51,008
We stayed up all night preparing this business plan.

239
00:17:51,259 --> 00:17:54,117
You said you'd give us 15 minutes, so you have to, Aunt Noi.

240
00:17:54,133 --> 00:17:55,617
Maybe the word isn't perfect,

241
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:58,311
but we didn't mean for it to be an insult to anyone.

242
00:18:02,106 --> 00:18:03,537
Please let me explain.

243
00:18:13,411 --> 00:18:15,222
Can you please let me explain a little further?

244
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,795
Well? Go on!

245
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:26,062
I'm waiting.

246
00:18:29,082 --> 00:18:34,459
I... I know someone who has issues living normally in society.

247
00:18:34,986 --> 00:18:36,909
And I really want to help him.

248
00:18:37,031 --> 00:18:38,103
Who is it?

249
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:39,702
How well do you know him?

250
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,000
How could a young person like yourself

251
00:18:42,025 --> 00:18:45,082
understand the sick and the elderly

252
00:18:45,096 --> 00:18:48,496
when your brain is still working properly and your body able?

253
00:18:48,973 --> 00:18:50,075
How could you possibly know

254
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,937
who is truly disabled actually needs?

255
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:55,139
I have done years of research.

256
00:18:55,237 --> 00:18:59,339
The consultant of the project is the best medical specialist.

257
00:18:59,592 --> 00:19:00,542
Alright.

258
00:19:01,453 --> 00:19:02,936
Next questions.

259
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:05,983
Is this application expensive?

260
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:10,217
How would someone with disabilities get access to it?

261
00:19:10,663 --> 00:19:14,936
Or do you assume every sick and elderly person has a smartphone?

262
00:19:15,634 --> 00:19:19,298
In that case, it means you're planning

263
00:19:19,323 --> 00:19:22,453
to profit off of someone's suffering.

264
00:19:22,468 --> 00:19:23,345
Am I right?

265
00:19:25,191 --> 00:19:30,702
I haven't invested in anything for years.

266
00:19:31,075 --> 00:19:32,702
Because I have enough.

267
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:35,459
If I want to invest one more time,

268
00:19:35,888 --> 00:19:41,459
it has to be in something really interesting and actually useful.

269
00:19:43,746 --> 00:19:46,979
Your application sounds interesting.

270
00:19:48,531 --> 00:19:51,306
But they're not sincere enough to me.

271
00:19:51,573 --> 00:19:52,831
But Aunt Noi—

272
00:19:52,841 --> 00:19:53,608
Enough.

273
00:19:53,623 --> 00:19:54,804
You've run out of time.

274
00:19:55,008 --> 00:19:57,845
I gave you what I promised.

275
00:20:01,595 --> 00:20:02,912
Aunt Noi, please.

276
00:20:03,386 --> 00:20:05,002
I am a disabled person.

277
00:20:13,677 --> 00:20:15,022
I have...

278
00:20:16,524 --> 00:20:17,905
Face blindness.

279
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:26,208
I can only see clothes, forms, and gestures.

280
00:20:28,133 --> 00:20:30,106
But what I can't see at all

281
00:20:31,248 --> 00:20:33,099
is what anyone looks like,

282
00:20:39,637 --> 00:20:41,497
how they look at me,

283
00:20:43,287 --> 00:20:44,777
or how they feel about me,

284
00:20:46,888 --> 00:20:48,382
if they're sneering,

285
00:20:49,389 --> 00:20:50,780
or pitying me.

286
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,309
I can't ever tell how anyone feels.

287
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,903
Do you know anything about this, Mirin?

288
00:21:04,933 --> 00:21:08,407
Besides my family, no one else does.

289
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:15,515
I developed this condition when I was about 10 years old.

290
00:21:17,991 --> 00:21:19,703
And it began when...

291
00:21:22,976 --> 00:21:24,220
When my mother disappeared.

292
00:21:29,936 --> 00:21:32,108
I came up with all these applications

293
00:21:32,764 --> 00:21:37,512
because I've been trying to find some ways to help myself

294
00:21:37,801 --> 00:21:39,660
with this face-blinding condition.

295
00:21:40,278 --> 00:21:42,140
I want to write a program,

296
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:47,622
to make apps that can tell me what people are feeling.

297
00:21:48,591 --> 00:21:50,020
But I'm not there yet.

298
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:53,506
So I'm making whatever apps I can for now,

299
00:21:54,749 --> 00:21:56,463
with the hope that one day

300
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:00,660
I can finally offer applications that can help

301
00:22:00,685 --> 00:22:03,683
people who need all kinds of help.

302
00:22:07,964 --> 00:22:08,703
Hey.

303
00:22:09,355 --> 00:22:11,023
What are you crying for, Mirin?

304
00:22:19,484 --> 00:22:20,502
Are you crying?

305
00:22:25,528 --> 00:22:27,207
I'm sorry. I'm just—

306
00:22:32,656 --> 00:22:34,100
Why are you crying?

307
00:22:37,157 --> 00:22:38,505
I'm fine.

308
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,306
But your cheeks are cold.

309
00:22:43,533 --> 00:22:46,177
I don't like it when your cheeks are cold.

310
00:22:54,992 --> 00:22:59,420
Now I know why I have to tell you who's approaching you,

311
00:22:59,733 --> 00:23:02,342
or why you can't tell what I'm feeling.

312
00:23:02,663 --> 00:23:04,300
I'll help you with everything.

313
00:23:04,868 --> 00:23:07,607
We'll find a way to make an app that can help you.

314
00:23:16,367 --> 00:23:18,899
I'll look through your business plan.

315
00:23:19,327 --> 00:23:23,202
If it piques my interest, I'll contact you.

316
00:23:24,829 --> 00:23:25,712
Thank you.

317
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:34,200
How was she looking at me?

318
00:23:37,352 --> 00:23:38,506
She...

319
00:23:39,494 --> 00:23:40,740
She sympathized with you.

320
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,142
She felt for you.

321
00:23:44,525 --> 00:23:45,542
I don't like it.

322
00:23:48,591 --> 00:23:52,380
I don't like when people feel sorry for me, or pity me.

323
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:55,400
Same goes to you.

324
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:58,705
Don't cry because of me again.

325
00:23:58,951 --> 00:24:00,136
Do you understand?

326
00:24:00,728 --> 00:24:01,801
I do.

327
00:24:01,942 --> 00:24:05,940
But I wasn't crying because I feel sorry for you or pity you.

328
00:24:06,514 --> 00:24:08,182
I was crying because...

329
00:24:09,234 --> 00:24:11,939
I understand how isolated it must have been for you.

330
00:24:14,481 --> 00:24:18,312
You need to be cautious, to be cold,

331
00:24:19,274 --> 00:24:24,619
to put on armor, just to hide your weakness.

332
00:24:32,115 --> 00:24:35,611
I am now looking at you with great determination

333
00:24:36,139 --> 00:24:37,460
and tremendous admiration.

334
00:24:41,691 --> 00:24:44,004
I will help you, Mr. Veekit.

335
00:24:47,908 --> 00:24:51,005
Not crying would be a big help.

336
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,404
I'll try.

337
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:21,506
What are you doing?

338
00:25:23,102 --> 00:25:24,899
I'm looking for a tool that will help you.

339
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:25,614
What?

340
00:25:26,235 --> 00:25:27,216
What tool?

341
00:25:28,517 --> 00:25:29,822
I can't tell you.

342
00:25:34,922 --> 00:25:36,742
I'm smiling at you right now.

343
00:25:37,247 --> 00:25:40,336
It's an understanding smile because I finally know how to help you.

344
00:25:52,026 --> 00:25:55,016
I get it now why you rarely smile.

345
00:25:55,539 --> 00:25:58,108
It's because you can't tell when people are smiling at you.

346
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,407
You look lovely when you smile, you know.

347
00:26:05,543 --> 00:26:06,376
What?

348
00:26:10,114 --> 00:26:11,078
Uhh...

349
00:26:11,973 --> 00:26:13,016
What did you say?

350
00:26:13,737 --> 00:26:15,056
It's getting late. Are you hungry?

351
00:26:15,503 --> 00:26:16,506
Just tell me.

352
00:26:16,811 --> 00:26:17,703
Did you say "lovely"?

353
00:26:18,888 --> 00:26:19,804
Uhh...

354
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:41,207
Your cheeks are burning.

355
00:26:41,857 --> 00:26:43,207
You're blushing again.

356
00:26:43,228 --> 00:26:44,697
Good. I like that.

357
00:26:45,069 --> 00:26:47,502
I like it much better when your cheeks are burning like this.

358
00:26:48,354 --> 00:26:49,540
Now smile.

359
00:26:51,374 --> 00:26:52,205
Quickly.

360
00:26:54,888 --> 00:26:56,001
That's nice.

361
00:26:56,235 --> 00:26:58,001
I like feeling your cheeks move.

362
00:26:58,139 --> 00:26:59,605
Good job, Moving-Cheeks.

363
00:27:00,669 --> 00:27:01,740
Smile again.

364
00:27:01,838 --> 00:27:02,659
Smile.

365
00:27:03,856 --> 00:27:05,600
Focus on your driving, Mr. Vee.

366
00:27:20,453 --> 00:27:21,800
Thank you for the ride.

367
00:27:22,937 --> 00:27:24,857
I am smiling really widely at you right now.

368
00:27:27,451 --> 00:27:28,742
Thanks.

369
00:27:29,361 --> 00:27:32,798
Let's see if Aunt Noi contacts us in three days.

370
00:27:34,645 --> 00:27:35,505
Okay.

371
00:27:36,084 --> 00:27:40,207
Are you sure you don't want to look for someone else just in case?

372
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,059
No.

373
00:27:42,499 --> 00:27:44,626
Right now I just want to win Aunt Noi over.

374
00:27:45,351 --> 00:27:48,222
If she agrees to this, it means our app is really good.

375
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:51,019
And if she's not buying it,

376
00:27:51,477 --> 00:27:55,001
I guess that's great feedback we can work on, too.

377
00:27:57,401 --> 00:27:59,219
I'm sure she likes it.

378
00:27:59,383 --> 00:28:00,780
Our application is superb.

379
00:28:01,125 --> 00:28:02,702
You just need to be ready.

380
00:28:03,201 --> 00:28:05,010
When I get that tool tomorrow,

381
00:28:05,207 --> 00:28:07,097
you'll be smiling more soon.

382
00:28:08,797 --> 00:28:09,705
Goodbye.

383
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:35,202
Is your body not used to coming home early anymore?

384
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:38,708
You've been staring off into space and holding that spoon for ages.

385
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:41,906
Well, she hasn't been home in two days, after all.

386
00:28:43,654 --> 00:28:48,456
To an unknowing eye, they must think my daughter is dating or something.

387
00:28:49,939 --> 00:28:51,605
You're making me laugh, Mom.

388
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:55,379
You know I wouldn't mind if you date, dear.

389
00:28:55,757 --> 00:28:59,857
But not coming home would be a bit much, don't you think?

390
00:29:00,525 --> 00:29:02,602
Grandma, I was working.

391
00:29:02,635 --> 00:29:05,019
And it was all for your very favorite regular customer, no less.

392
00:29:05,259 --> 00:29:05,976
Who?

393
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,139
Noi?

394
00:29:07,801 --> 00:29:08,700
Yes, Mom.

395
00:29:08,954 --> 00:29:12,211
She might look like our typical nosy neighbor,

396
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:14,641
but she is, in fact, a very famous investor.

397
00:29:14,703 --> 00:29:17,008
That's why I've been telling you to spoil her rotten

398
00:29:17,033 --> 00:29:18,954
and just bake what she asks.

399
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:22,783
What, you know who she is?

400
00:29:22,914 --> 00:29:24,599
You don't know your mother and Noi have

401
00:29:24,624 --> 00:29:26,101
been friends since they were girls?

402
00:29:26,663 --> 00:29:27,484
Mom?

403
00:29:28,986 --> 00:29:30,380
Why didn't you tell me?

404
00:29:30,988 --> 00:29:32,380
You never asked.

405
00:29:32,651 --> 00:29:33,382
What?

406
00:29:33,496 --> 00:29:34,579
Just eat your dinner.

407
00:29:44,386 --> 00:29:46,708
So how close are you with Veekit?

408
00:29:47,382 --> 00:29:49,182
He's just my boss.

409
00:29:50,617 --> 00:29:52,709
It wouldn't be bad if that's all he remains to be.

410
00:29:56,318 --> 00:29:58,059
I'm not after him or anything.

411
00:29:58,865 --> 00:30:00,460
And he's way too rich,

412
00:30:00,795 --> 00:30:02,305
so there's no way he would want anything to do with me.

413
00:30:03,284 --> 00:30:06,698
I'm being nice because I feel bad for him

414
00:30:06,723 --> 00:30:09,281
and sympathize with him, is all.

415
00:30:10,697 --> 00:30:14,062
Sympathy is a good thing to have.

416
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,577
But if it stems from knowing a secret you can't tell the person,

417
00:30:21,213 --> 00:30:24,222
would you like that sympathy if it were you?

418
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:33,213
You know why you got that job, Rin.

419
00:30:33,764 --> 00:30:37,142
And now you get close to him because you feel sorry for him.

420
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,216
If he finds out one day

421
00:30:41,711 --> 00:30:44,303
that you used his mother's name to get the job,

422
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:48,109
that you know where his mother is but won't tell him,

423
00:30:48,863 --> 00:30:50,299
how would he feel?

424
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:56,699
He is rich, but even that doesn't help him find his mother.

425
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:01,306
He must have been such a lonely child.

426
00:31:06,284 --> 00:31:09,906
Everything you said was right.

427
00:31:11,918 --> 00:31:13,899
I really am selfish.

428
00:31:15,859 --> 00:31:18,002
I feel bad for what I did.

429
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:24,210
But I just want to help him a little more.

430
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:28,106
We only need to seal this deal.

431
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:30,902
I'll quit after that.

432
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,822
Help him as much as you can

433
00:31:40,991 --> 00:31:43,537
before you quit, Neeraaumpan.

434
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:10,742
Go for it, Mirin.

435
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,205
You got this.

436
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:17,822
That's a clicker for dog-training.

437
00:32:18,044 --> 00:32:20,001
Are you treating me like a dog?

438
00:32:20,158 --> 00:32:21,296
Will you listen to me first?

439
00:32:21,321 --> 00:32:22,346
No, I won't.

440
00:32:22,684 --> 00:32:25,362
You insolent fool, I'm your boss, not your dog.

441
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:26,308
Calm down.

442
00:32:26,318 --> 00:32:26,992
You dork.

443
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:27,650
You—

444
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,807
- You dummy! - Please.

445
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:29,758
You unthinking dolt.

446
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:31,007
- Listen to me! - Ugh!

447
00:32:35,235 --> 00:32:36,108
Well...

448
00:32:36,739 --> 00:32:39,706
If there's no clicking noise like this,

449
00:32:41,402 --> 00:32:44,619
how would you know when to smile?

450
00:32:47,561 --> 00:32:50,580
You... You have good hearing.

451
00:32:50,936 --> 00:32:55,109
Whichever way I click, you turn that way and smile.

452
00:32:55,973 --> 00:32:57,703
Think of your business meetings.

453
00:32:57,903 --> 00:32:59,703
If someone smiles at you, but you don't smile back,

454
00:32:59,862 --> 00:33:02,903
it's going to make the negotiation feel tense and awkward.

455
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:06,509
Do you remember when we went to see Big Noi?

456
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,614
When you asked her if you could explain,

457
00:33:09,937 --> 00:33:11,982
she was looking at you with an intention to listen.

458
00:33:12,305 --> 00:33:13,605
You just couldn't see it.

459
00:33:15,177 --> 00:33:17,709
If I click this once,

460
00:33:20,118 --> 00:33:23,912
you'll know you can keep speaking.

461
00:33:28,002 --> 00:33:29,936
And if... you click it twice?

462
00:33:32,657 --> 00:33:33,542
See?

463
00:33:33,657 --> 00:33:35,103
This is what we need to sort out.

464
00:33:35,868 --> 00:33:37,139
Let's make it simple.

465
00:33:37,554 --> 00:33:38,619
One click...

466
00:33:39,825 --> 00:33:42,915
means yes, means you should smile, means it's okay.

467
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,915
Two clicks...

468
00:33:46,668 --> 00:33:49,659
mean the opposite.

469
00:33:59,088 --> 00:34:01,502
How would I know who is where?

470
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:08,737
From now on, I'll tell you who is where in which direction.

471
00:34:08,751 --> 00:34:13,512
For example, left and right at the meeting table.

472
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:16,530
Let's try this.

473
00:34:16,917 --> 00:34:18,057
It might just work.

474
00:34:23,825 --> 00:34:24,903
What if...

475
00:34:25,948 --> 00:34:29,062
What if one day you were gone,

476
00:34:32,037 --> 00:34:33,142
what would I do?

477
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,259
If I got used to having you around,

478
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:41,000
and then one day you disappeared,

479
00:34:43,074 --> 00:34:44,060
what would I do?

480
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:53,297
There's your hot chocolate.

481
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,400
Now there's also this stupid clicker.

482
00:35:00,816 --> 00:35:03,740
Anyone can use this clicker.

483
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:09,405
As for the hot chocolate, I can teach you.

484
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:13,829
In case you want to fire me one day...

485
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:24,016
Then... let's try this one first.

486
00:35:26,394 --> 00:35:27,380
But keep in mind,

487
00:35:29,088 --> 00:35:31,536
there is no way I'm making that hot chocolate myself.

488
00:35:34,813 --> 00:35:36,980
Because you're not going anywhere.

489
00:35:57,503 --> 00:35:58,899
Big Noi is a woman.

490
00:36:00,968 --> 00:36:01,699
Yes.

491
00:36:02,262 --> 00:36:05,300
That's the only thing we can confirm for now. Big Noi is a woman.

492
00:36:06,503 --> 00:36:07,960
She's in her late 50's.

493
00:36:07,983 --> 00:36:09,174
Still healthy.

494
00:36:09,697 --> 00:36:12,909
She's retired to live a quiet life, but she's filthy rich.

495
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:20,460
This means Big Noi truly isn't just a myth.

496
00:36:21,128 --> 00:36:22,007
Sure isn't.

497
00:36:22,314 --> 00:36:25,607
But no one's seen her in 6-7 years.

498
00:36:26,423 --> 00:36:27,211
Okay.

499
00:36:28,496 --> 00:36:29,322
Good work.

500
00:36:29,746 --> 00:36:31,139
Thank you, both of you.

501
00:36:31,426 --> 00:36:32,702
That was a big help.

502
00:36:32,943 --> 00:36:35,318
Feel free to give us a ring if you need anything, sir.

503
00:36:35,528 --> 00:36:36,413
We're here to help.

504
00:36:36,752 --> 00:36:37,804
Excuse us.

505
00:36:59,894 --> 00:37:01,022
But...

506
00:37:04,408 --> 00:37:07,020
Who is the person Veekit met?

507
00:37:14,512 --> 00:37:15,397
On your right.

508
00:37:16,002 --> 00:37:18,315
Naruemon... Hello.

509
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,056
On your right.

510
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:28,706
Puttipong.

511
00:37:29,382 --> 00:37:30,308
Hello.

512
00:37:32,231 --> 00:37:33,496
On your left.

513
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:35,502
That's Neeramon and Thanat.

514
00:37:35,915 --> 00:37:36,911
Thanat, hi.

515
00:37:37,348 --> 00:37:38,911
And, hello, Neeramon.

516
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,407
That new app you sent me...

517
00:37:42,028 --> 00:37:43,299
The system was awesome.

518
00:37:43,684 --> 00:37:45,210
I'm glad you liked it, sir.

519
00:37:46,875 --> 00:37:48,109
Me, too.

520
00:37:50,066 --> 00:37:51,108
Do your best.

521
00:37:51,551 --> 00:37:52,337
Yes.

522
00:37:55,355 --> 00:37:58,342
Everyone looks so surprised in a good way.

523
00:37:58,477 --> 00:37:59,819
They all look so happy to see you smile.

524
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,703
On your right. That's Somsi.

525
00:38:02,663 --> 00:38:03,457
Somsi.

526
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:05,859
Hi.

527
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:06,970
Hello.

528
00:38:07,841 --> 00:38:09,305
I'm counting on you.

529
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,811
This is everything we have on it.

530
00:38:12,325 --> 00:38:13,705
Oh, hey. Here they come.

531
00:38:14,364 --> 00:38:15,213
Hello.

532
00:38:15,983 --> 00:38:17,213
It's Maewkwak and Manit.

533
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,213
Maewkwak.

534
00:38:19,097 --> 00:38:19,908
Manit.

535
00:38:22,038 --> 00:38:23,017
How are you two?

536
00:38:24,354 --> 00:38:25,223
Do your best.

537
00:38:26,598 --> 00:38:27,977
I don't believe it.

538
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:31,109
Isn't Neeraaumpan a great secretary?

539
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,010
Not only did she not get fired,

540
00:38:33,217 --> 00:38:34,980
she even makes him smile.

541
00:38:38,165 --> 00:38:39,300
Miss Tanya is here.

542
00:38:43,668 --> 00:38:45,739
Whatever made you show up here so suddenly?

543
00:38:46,361 --> 00:38:49,859
Just want to confirm the investment terms before the meeting.

544
00:38:50,321 --> 00:38:52,700
Will you please get the document ready, then, Miss Aew-eas?

545
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:53,712
Of course, Boss.

546
00:38:57,145 --> 00:38:58,260
Did you have lunch?

547
00:38:58,657 --> 00:38:59,801
It's nearly noon.

548
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,204
I'm not hungry.

549
00:39:01,379 --> 00:39:02,311
Let's talk business first.

550
00:39:02,712 --> 00:39:03,500
This way.

551
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:07,303
Wait.

552
00:39:07,822 --> 00:39:10,857
Is... Veekit smiling and laughing?

553
00:39:11,105 --> 00:39:12,306
Have a good day.

554
00:39:15,263 --> 00:39:16,657
Ya, where are you going?

555
00:39:16,702 --> 00:39:17,296
Ya.

556
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,105
It's Miss Tanya. She's coming straight this way.

557
00:39:25,491 --> 00:39:26,804
Hello, Veekit.

558
00:39:28,694 --> 00:39:29,400
Hi.

559
00:39:31,265 --> 00:39:36,379
I came to see Chanon and saw you smiling over here.

560
00:39:37,034 --> 00:39:38,777
I thought you might be in a good mood today,

561
00:39:39,197 --> 00:39:40,802
so I came to say hello.

562
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:43,001
Oh, I see.

563
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,034
It's... It's nearly noon.

564
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:51,346
Why don't we have lunch?

565
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:53,207
I'll have to turn you down.

566
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,697
I'm busy saying hello to all my employees.

567
00:40:01,362 --> 00:40:03,303
You smile so much more these days.

568
00:40:04,054 --> 00:40:05,303
Did you just learn how?

569
00:40:07,303 --> 00:40:08,459
It's because of her.

570
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,404
She's the reason I smile.

571
00:40:11,779 --> 00:40:12,605
See you.

572
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:17,736
I'll see you at the investment meeting.

573
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:27,136
I do hope your investor isn't so loaded that even I can't compete with.

574
00:40:27,457 --> 00:40:30,817
And I hope my investor agrees

575
00:40:31,263 --> 00:40:33,517
and approves of the app I make.

576
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:36,438
If we want the same thing,

577
00:40:36,457 --> 00:40:41,607
I believe even one million is a highly valuable investment.

578
00:40:42,568 --> 00:40:48,737
I can't wait to see if your blind ideal will succeed.

579
00:40:50,491 --> 00:40:51,506
Don't worry.

580
00:40:52,072 --> 00:40:54,740
We will do our best.

581
00:40:57,562 --> 00:40:58,389
Let's go.

582
00:41:04,207 --> 00:41:05,057
Chanon.

583
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:09,542
I must become the key shareholder at Next Innovation.

584
00:41:09,811 --> 00:41:11,777
I don't care how much money I need to invest to make that happen.

585
00:41:12,146 --> 00:41:16,497
And the first thing I'll do is fire that secretary.

586
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:18,897
Tanya, wait.

587
00:41:19,841 --> 00:41:20,508
But...

588
00:41:21,616 --> 00:41:23,004
Your document.

589
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:34,327
If Miss Tanya and Mr. Chanon work together,

590
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:36,379
the board of directors will surely acknowledge them.

591
00:41:39,645 --> 00:41:41,856
Aunt Noi hasn't gotten back to us.

592
00:41:42,703 --> 00:41:44,220
Do you want me to call her?

593
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:45,259
I already did.

594
00:41:46,891 --> 00:41:47,980
I couldn't reach her.

595
00:41:49,069 --> 00:41:50,800
But what will we do tomorrow?

596
00:41:53,238 --> 00:41:56,306
We can't go to the meeting without an investor.

597
00:41:57,091 --> 00:41:58,804
Let's look for someone else today.

598
00:41:59,023 --> 00:42:02,137
I believe there must be some investors who want to do business with you.

599
00:42:02,616 --> 00:42:03,524
Let's not wait for Aunt Noi—

600
00:42:03,534 --> 00:42:04,503
I'll wait.

601
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:10,207
Big Noi is the only investor I want.

602
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:23,410
Directed by Ekkasit Trakulkasemsuk and Pantip Vibultham.

603
00:42:24,743 --> 00:42:25,611
Mirin!

604
00:42:25,977 --> 00:42:27,905
Don't run. Wait for me.

605
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,711
Mirin!

606
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,404
Hey, you.

607
00:42:42,105 --> 00:42:43,337
Apologize.

608
00:42:43,813 --> 00:42:45,499
But I didn't mean it.

609
00:42:45,967 --> 00:42:47,208
Even if you didn't,

610
00:42:47,317 --> 00:42:49,539
you hurt me anyway, so you should apologize.

611
00:42:49,853 --> 00:42:51,179
You hurt me, too.

612
00:42:51,426 --> 00:42:52,306
You hurt me worse.

613
00:42:52,404 --> 00:42:54,487
- You hurt me worse. - You ran into me.

614
00:42:54,518 --> 00:42:56,207
- It's you who ran into me! - Mirin.

615
00:42:56,334 --> 00:42:58,234
I told you not to run.

616
00:42:58,248 --> 00:42:59,297
- Veekit! - Get up, dear.

617
00:42:59,416 --> 00:43:01,303
- Let's get you on your feet, shall we? - Vee!

618
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:04,099
- Vee, baby. - Are you hurt?

619
00:43:04,459 --> 00:43:05,702
You scared me there.

620
00:43:06,026 --> 00:43:07,862
Don't run off like that again.

621
00:43:08,337 --> 00:43:10,007
I don't want you getting lost, alright?

622
00:43:10,131 --> 00:43:11,102
Yes, Mom.

623
00:43:13,814 --> 00:43:15,160
They bumped into each other.

624
00:43:16,186 --> 00:43:17,808
- I'm so sorry. - It's alright.

625
00:43:18,299 --> 00:43:19,700
Apologize, both of you.

626
00:43:23,388 --> 00:43:24,509
- Sorry. - Sorry.

627
00:43:27,405 --> 00:43:28,805
- Let's go, babe. - Let's get going.

628
00:43:29,237 --> 00:43:31,802
I told you you shouldn't run off.

629
00:43:48,782 --> 00:43:50,004
What are you doing here?

630
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:51,508
Mr. Chanon.

631
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,804
This is my hiding place.

632
00:43:53,874 --> 00:43:54,700
Oh?

633
00:43:54,788 --> 00:43:55,506
Is it?

634
00:43:55,637 --> 00:43:57,402
Aren't you neat?

635
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,850
With all your little flirtatious endeavor,

636
00:43:59,862 --> 00:44:01,850
which one of them are you actually aiming for?

637
00:44:01,865 --> 00:44:04,102
Don't mind what Tanya said.

638
00:44:04,305 --> 00:44:07,500
I know you two don't think of me that way.

639
00:44:07,675 --> 00:44:09,802
Are you sure I don't?

640
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:14,007
I'm starting to feel like stealing her away from you,

641
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:16,506
Veekit.
