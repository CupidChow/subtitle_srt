1
00:00:00,097 --> 00:00:01,589
We can't let him find out that you can—

2
00:00:01,592 --> 00:00:02,377
That I can see now.

3
00:00:02,428 --> 00:00:03,802
Then I'm coming with you.

4
00:00:04,285 --> 00:00:05,251
Hello, Miss Eas?

5
00:00:05,271 --> 00:00:06,853
Please schedule a meeting for me.

6
00:00:06,866 --> 00:00:08,004
Today, at 11 o'clock.

7
00:00:08,644 --> 00:00:09,281
How is it?

8
00:00:09,291 --> 00:00:10,321
Everything's alright?

9
00:00:10,331 --> 00:00:12,211
90% of everyone in that room is on our team.

10
00:00:12,407 --> 00:00:15,771
The other 10% is acting like they're not, just for fairness' sake.

11
00:00:16,069 --> 00:00:16,779
Cool.

12
00:00:17,111 --> 00:00:18,309
It's just a company.

13
00:00:18,521 --> 00:00:19,432
Just take it.

14
00:00:19,628 --> 00:00:21,011
But please,

15
00:00:21,155 --> 00:00:22,779
just don't get my loved ones involved.

16
00:00:23,229 --> 00:00:24,776
Leave my mother out of this.

17
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:26,108
Leave Mirin out of this.

18
00:00:26,768 --> 00:00:28,100
We have one agenda today.

19
00:00:28,115 --> 00:00:29,678
I would like to propose the dismissal of Veekit

20
00:00:29,703 --> 00:00:31,681
as the Chief Executive of Next Innovation.

21
00:00:31,908 --> 00:00:33,008
I object.

22
00:00:33,139 --> 00:00:35,514
As a company, I'd like to ask you all

23
00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:37,203
to consider a second chance for Veekit.

24
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,383
I vote for Veekit.

25
00:00:38,804 --> 00:00:39,702
Hold on.

26
00:00:41,093 --> 00:00:43,093
Are you sure this is how you want to play this?

27
00:00:43,108 --> 00:00:44,802
We can discuss this at home.

28
00:00:44,906 --> 00:00:45,810
No!

29
00:00:46,268 --> 00:00:49,401
You honestly didn't have to do any of this.

30
00:00:49,736 --> 00:00:50,814
Hello, Miss Tanya.

31
00:00:51,148 --> 00:00:52,214
You wanted to see me?

32
00:00:52,561 --> 00:00:53,069
Yes.

33
00:00:53,077 --> 00:00:53,840
Well,

34
00:00:53,857 --> 00:00:57,693
would it be difficult to...

35
00:00:57,705 --> 00:00:58,798
leak those data?

36
00:01:01,287 --> 00:01:05,103
Breaking news for the users of the applications of Next Innovation

37
00:01:05,336 --> 00:01:08,961
managed by CEO Veekit Kraipiwat.

38
00:01:08,977 --> 00:01:13,272
(It's reported that the applications' user data was leaked.)

39
00:01:15,706 --> 00:01:18,220
(It's estimated that around 20,000 users are affected by it.)

40
00:01:18,232 --> 00:01:21,103
(Meanwhile, the shareholders are selling their shares)

41
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:23,900
(which leads to a plummet in Next Innovation's shares.)

42
00:01:23,914 --> 00:01:27,108
(The damage is estimated to be several hundred million baht.)

43
00:01:27,624 --> 00:01:31,280
(There is no update or announcement)

44
00:01:31,305 --> 00:01:34,526
(regarding the incident from the company.)

45
00:01:37,204 --> 00:01:40,115
I apologize for the incident.

46
00:01:40,124 --> 00:01:43,819
(The data was leaked from our two applications.)

47
00:01:44,669 --> 00:01:46,506
Call Veekit and Chanon to come to meet me right now.

48
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,500
I got it.

49
00:01:48,786 --> 00:01:50,805
Tell Granddad that I will go to see him right away.

50
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:53,706
You need to stay calm.

51
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:55,140
You didn't do anything wrong.

52
00:01:56,278 --> 00:01:57,540
Hello, Tanya.

53
00:01:57,739 --> 00:01:58,598
Where are you?

54
00:01:58,616 --> 00:01:59,903
We need to talk right now.

55
00:02:02,754 --> 00:02:04,583
Mom, I need to go talk to Tanya.

56
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:06,200
Wait.

57
00:02:07,066 --> 00:02:08,060
I'm going with you.

58
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:11,967
The incident occurred while it was under my supervision.

59
00:02:11,976 --> 00:02:17,103
Although I can't identify the cause of the data breach at the moment,

60
00:02:17,111 --> 00:02:19,139
(I guarantee that we will take responsibility for it.)

61
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:21,257
We will take action as soon as possible.

62
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,008
(We will make an official announcement soon.)

00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:40,010

Directed by Ekkasit Trakulkasemsuk and Pantip Vibultham

69
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:37,050
THE DEFEATED POINT

70
00:03:39,456 --> 00:03:41,897
Tanya, this is illegal.

71
00:03:42,068 --> 00:03:43,305
What laws?

72
00:03:44,506 --> 00:03:46,512
The laws can't do anything to us.

73
00:03:46,522 --> 00:03:48,413
At least, you should have told me.

74
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:50,903
This causes damage to the company.

75
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,702
The company that I have built.

76
00:03:54,822 --> 00:03:56,297
From now on,

77
00:03:57,099 --> 00:03:59,416
I guess you need to rebuild it.

78
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,805
Didn't you see the news?

79
00:04:03,454 --> 00:04:06,400
The data was leaked from applications managed by Mr. Veekit Kraipiwat.

80
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:09,420
Things are messy and ruined for him.

81
00:04:10,057 --> 00:04:11,602
He will be sued.

82
00:04:12,186 --> 00:04:15,420
You can step up to solve the problem in your way.

83
00:04:16,232 --> 00:04:19,908
Then the Next Innovation's shares will return to their original value.

84
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:24,810
I love your plan.

85
00:04:24,853 --> 00:04:30,105
Actually, I didn't want you to know about this.

86
00:04:30,294 --> 00:04:34,703
I just want to do what I can to help end this fight.

87
00:04:34,954 --> 00:04:36,300
I understand you.

88
00:04:36,616 --> 00:04:37,385
Thank you.

89
00:04:37,394 --> 00:04:39,315
I totally support your plan.

90
00:04:39,325 --> 00:04:41,608
I can't do anything much about it.

91
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,170
It's great that you step in and take action.

92
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:47,656
Do you know how serious this is?

93
00:04:47,973 --> 00:04:50,059
Veekit can end up in jail.

94
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,807
In the worst case, they may find out that we are behind it.

95
00:04:52,832 --> 00:04:55,737
Both Maewkwak and Manit will be in trouble.

96
00:05:06,337 --> 00:05:07,700
It won't happen.

97
00:05:08,512 --> 00:05:09,903
if we stick to our plan.

98
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:19,108
As a majority shareholder, I prepared a cheque.

99
00:05:21,253 --> 00:05:24,034
Big Noi will never take responsibility for the costs

100
00:05:24,059 --> 00:05:26,127
that are not stated in the agreement.

101
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,202
The other shareholders are all stepping back.

102
00:05:31,642 --> 00:05:35,711
I am the only one who can save your company.

103
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:43,702
Take the money and pay compensation to the users.

104
00:05:44,191 --> 00:05:48,007
Then hold a press conference and replace Veekit as the new CEO.

105
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,407
You can quickly solve the problem,

106
00:05:50,724 --> 00:05:52,663
and also get investment to support the company.

107
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,706
If your grandfather still insists on having Veekit as the CEO,

108
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:02,102
I think you should resign and start your own company.

109
00:06:10,157 --> 00:06:12,100
We have come this far.

110
00:06:12,496 --> 00:06:14,499
We can't go back.

111
00:06:14,601 --> 00:06:18,097
Since the day you decided to send the photos to Veekit,

112
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:20,208
your goal is to destroy him.

113
00:06:21,602 --> 00:06:22,897
Bring him to the rock bottom.

114
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,900
Take your money back.

115
00:06:34,823 --> 00:06:37,718
Let me talk to my grandpa first.

116
00:06:40,425 --> 00:06:41,419
About this,

117
00:06:41,497 --> 00:06:42,816
let me take care of it.

118
00:06:42,834 --> 00:06:44,143
Mom, you stay out of it.

119
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:46,309
Non.

120
00:06:54,317 --> 00:06:55,377
What happened?

121
00:06:56,937 --> 00:06:58,408
How was the data leaked?

122
00:07:02,309 --> 00:07:03,306
I...

123
00:07:03,983 --> 00:07:05,506
I still don't know the cause.

124
00:07:07,164 --> 00:07:08,302
I don't know it, too.

125
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:13,205
But I called my secretary to call everyone in to check the system.

126
00:07:13,488 --> 00:07:15,617
We will find out how this happened.

127
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,579
Why is your name on the news?

128
00:07:21,665 --> 00:07:25,807
Why was only the user data of the applications managed by you leaked?

129
00:07:32,773 --> 00:07:35,100
Why are you asking that?

130
00:07:35,305 --> 00:07:39,408
The system does not categorize the user data based on who manages it.

131
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,872
If the data from the application managed by both of you was leaked,

132
00:07:41,885 --> 00:07:43,410
I wouldn't have asked the question.

133
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:49,534
I called you to meet me because I want to know what happened.

134
00:07:50,518 --> 00:07:53,305
You two had a fight the other day.

135
00:07:53,623 --> 00:07:57,105
A security and some of the employees saw it.

136
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,204
Then this happened.

137
00:08:01,591 --> 00:08:04,654
Are you saying that I am behind it?

138
00:08:04,668 --> 00:08:06,539
I just want to know what happened.

139
00:08:06,548 --> 00:08:08,063
I don't have an answer for you right now.

140
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:12,200
All I know is that you can't accept the truth

141
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:15,730
that this is Veekit's fault.

142
00:08:17,235 --> 00:08:18,857
The news stated it clearly.

143
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:23,939
"The applications managed by CEO"

144
00:08:23,964 --> 00:08:27,838
"Veekit Kraipiwat accidentally leaked user data."

145
00:08:29,127 --> 00:08:30,106
Excuse me.

146
00:08:30,804 --> 00:08:33,497
The company's executives are calling us nonstop.

147
00:08:33,869 --> 00:08:37,099
They want to know how you are going to solve the problem.

148
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:39,309
And...

149
00:08:39,404 --> 00:08:40,617
And what?

150
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,725
They all proposed that Veekit

151
00:08:43,736 --> 00:08:45,720
should announce his resignation as soon as possible.

152
00:08:47,525 --> 00:08:48,404
Get out.

153
00:08:57,198 --> 00:09:01,308
I insist that I have nothing to do with it.

154
00:09:02,048 --> 00:09:05,302
But I have no evidence to prove it.

155
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:09,605
I think the best solution for everyone is that I should resign.

156
00:09:17,383 --> 00:09:19,180
This is the quickest response that we can do.

157
00:09:20,137 --> 00:09:21,908
It will make everyone satisfied.

158
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,108
About the company,

159
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:27,912
I believe that Non,

160
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,130
he is ready to take over it.

161
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,200
Let's get ready.

162
00:09:36,768 --> 00:09:38,810
I'm going to hold a press conference today.

163
00:09:39,293 --> 00:09:41,805
I need to ask you a favor, Non.

164
00:09:42,908 --> 00:09:45,445
Please set up a committee to investigate

165
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:47,808
everyone who was involved in the incident.

166
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:50,508
Don't worry about that.

167
00:09:50,819 --> 00:09:54,662
I will find out what the cause of the incident is.

168
00:10:20,177 --> 00:10:20,887
Excuse me.

169
00:10:21,247 --> 00:10:21,915
Excuse me.

170
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:23,069
Excuse me.

171
00:10:23,188 --> 00:10:24,155
Excuse me.

172
00:10:24,247 --> 00:10:25,117
Excuse me.

173
00:10:25,213 --> 00:10:25,715
Excuse me.

174
00:10:32,711 --> 00:10:33,605
Mr. Vee.

175
00:10:34,376 --> 00:10:36,419
I came here as fast as I could.

176
00:10:36,432 --> 00:10:37,909
Do you really have no other choice?

177
00:10:37,976 --> 00:10:39,811
Why did you make such a decision?

178
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,601
We should find out what the truth is first.

179
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:01,060
I'm sorry for making you worried.

180
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:11,013
This is the best thing we can do at the moment.

181
00:11:12,848 --> 00:11:13,940
No matter what,

182
00:11:14,619 --> 00:11:16,342
I'll find those who did this.

183
00:11:17,798 --> 00:11:19,410
The reporters are waiting for you.

184
00:11:20,906 --> 00:11:24,339
You should keep it short.

185
00:11:25,157 --> 00:11:27,306
If you are asked about the compensation,

186
00:11:27,731 --> 00:11:31,014
just tell them that we will take care of it.

187
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:32,207
We?

188
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,308
Who are "we"?

189
00:11:38,401 --> 00:11:40,208
I've briefly talked to Tanya about it.

190
00:11:40,619 --> 00:11:42,208
She said she would help us.

191
00:11:44,177 --> 00:11:45,939
You two reached the answer quite fast.

192
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,342
It's unbelievably fast.

193
00:11:58,173 --> 00:11:59,509
It is my job.

194
00:12:01,007 --> 00:12:01,906
Right.

195
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:05,139
Let's go.

196
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,508
I'll be by your side.

197
00:12:26,957 --> 00:12:27,802
How are you feeling?

198
00:12:27,841 --> 00:12:29,139
Are you excited?

199
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:31,019
I'm ready to celebrate.

200
00:12:33,482 --> 00:12:34,909
That's enough, Tanya.

201
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,317
You are way over the line already.

202
00:12:38,642 --> 00:12:41,002
You still don't understand why I did it, do you?

203
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:45,700
Everything that you want is going to become yours.

204
00:12:49,506 --> 00:12:50,622
Here he is.

205
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,208
I would like to thank everyone for coming here today

206
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,826
(Next Innovation Holds Press Conference)

207
00:13:10,826 --> 00:13:12,490
and give me a chance to explain.

208
00:13:15,857 --> 00:13:17,100
First of all,

209
00:13:25,122 --> 00:13:29,345
I truly apologize to everyone for the incident.

210
00:13:32,918 --> 00:13:39,106
The incident happened when I was in charge.

211
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,697
From the initial investigation,

212
00:13:51,962 --> 00:13:58,899
we found the data was leaked from Get Well Soon and Good Life.

213
00:14:00,505 --> 00:14:03,702
They are health assistant applications.

214
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,002
The leaked data is the personal data of the users.

215
00:14:09,577 --> 00:14:12,220
It's not the data that everyone is willing to disclose.

216
00:14:15,391 --> 00:14:17,420
You are up in five minutes.

217
00:14:18,619 --> 00:14:19,401
Alright.

218
00:14:21,562 --> 00:14:22,511
Enjoy it.

219
00:14:23,882 --> 00:14:26,813
I'm taking responsibility for the incident

220
00:14:30,081 --> 00:14:33,508
by resigning from the CEO of Next Innovation.

221
00:14:42,819 --> 00:14:46,511
The person who will replace me as the new CEO is

222
00:14:48,306 --> 00:14:50,305
Mr. Chanon Kanchanarak.

223
00:14:58,183 --> 00:14:59,377
Please welcome Mr. Chanon.

224
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:22,105
Hello, I'm Tanya Kanokkul.

225
00:15:27,518 --> 00:15:28,511
Mr. Chanon.

226
00:15:37,808 --> 00:15:41,411
We are going to work together to manage Next Innovation.

227
00:15:46,774 --> 00:15:49,807
We will restore your trust.

228
00:15:50,379 --> 00:15:53,337
We will take Next Innovation higher.

229
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,099
What's going on?

230
00:15:55,659 --> 00:15:57,706
How did the company end up in the hands of a brat like her?

231
00:15:57,758 --> 00:15:59,700
How did this happen?

232
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:20,242
How will you compensate the users?

233
00:16:26,635 --> 00:16:28,902
Did you develop all these applications by yourself?

234
00:16:29,007 --> 00:16:29,810
Yes.

235
00:16:30,354 --> 00:16:32,238
Some of them were rejected.

236
00:16:32,247 --> 00:16:34,616
Some of them are not completed.

237
00:16:34,979 --> 00:16:37,712
But I keep them in case the world might need them.

238
00:16:37,856 --> 00:16:40,640
This is cool.

239
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,703
Is there anything I can help you, Veekit?

240
00:16:51,551 --> 00:16:53,011
Tanya, what do you want?

241
00:16:56,397 --> 00:16:57,500
Nothing.

242
00:16:58,594 --> 00:17:00,263
What I want to see,

243
00:17:00,278 --> 00:17:01,705
what I want to have,

244
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,610
I already got them.

245
00:17:04,758 --> 00:17:07,017
You are not going to leave me alone, aren't you?

246
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:09,417
Can I ask you something?

247
00:17:09,856 --> 00:17:11,417
Are you still using the same last name?

248
00:17:11,542 --> 00:17:13,576
I tried to send my compassion to you but it was returned.

249
00:17:17,268 --> 00:17:19,576
You still don't know your place, do you?

250
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,557
Do you want to be more doomed than you already are?

251
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:23,980
I can't imagine if there will be a place for you.

252
00:17:23,998 --> 00:17:25,604
Anywhere that don't have you around.

253
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:27,106
I'm fine with it.

254
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:30,605
Let's go, Girlfriend.

255
00:17:32,225 --> 00:17:33,013
Alright.

256
00:17:53,094 --> 00:17:54,103
Wait for me here.

257
00:17:54,251 --> 00:17:55,125
You can put the box down.

258
00:17:55,139 --> 00:17:56,405
I'll go get the car.

259
00:17:56,539 --> 00:17:58,179
Okay. I'll look after your stuff.

260
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:02,930
Wait a minute.

261
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,306
Be careful. Don't let mosquitos bite you.

262
00:18:04,413 --> 00:18:05,318
Alright.

263
00:18:10,899 --> 00:18:12,001
"He is the nice one."

264
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,308
That was the first thing you said about me.

265
00:18:22,151 --> 00:18:24,408
You said I was the nice one.

266
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:29,000
You no longer view me that way, do you?

267
00:18:33,096 --> 00:18:35,405
You are nice to everyone except to yourself.

268
00:18:37,918 --> 00:18:40,617
You try to do everything that other people want you to do.

269
00:18:41,801 --> 00:18:44,220
You let other people be what they want to be.

270
00:18:45,613 --> 00:18:47,820
I don't believe that you are behind the plan to sabotage Veekit.

271
00:18:49,374 --> 00:18:54,100
But I think the fact that you let it happen,

272
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:56,607
it's also mean.

273
00:18:57,675 --> 00:19:01,014
That's the reason why Mr. Vee feels hurt.

274
00:19:12,826 --> 00:19:14,742
I let it happen

275
00:19:17,097 --> 00:19:22,139
because I want to have what I desire for once.

276
00:19:24,542 --> 00:19:25,742
Is that a bad thing?

277
00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:28,140
In your opinion.

278
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,410
Yes.

279
00:19:34,678 --> 00:19:36,204
I'm very mad at you.

280
00:19:37,383 --> 00:19:38,940
I'm mad that you are acting like this,

281
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,911
that you hurt Mr. Vee,

282
00:19:44,354 --> 00:19:46,140
and that you abandon

283
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:50,940
Mr. Chanon whom I met on the first day.

284
00:20:10,414 --> 00:20:11,902
Mirin, get in the car.

285
00:20:12,188 --> 00:20:13,385
I'll get the boxes into the trunk.

286
00:20:13,401 --> 00:20:14,474
But I can help you.

287
00:20:14,485 --> 00:20:15,408
I know that.

288
00:20:16,219 --> 00:20:17,542
But I want you to get in the car.

289
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:52,099
Good luck, brother.

290
00:21:24,921 --> 00:21:26,816
What are you going to do next?

291
00:21:28,786 --> 00:21:29,906
I'll start again.

292
00:21:30,663 --> 00:21:32,620
I don't know how things will turn out.

293
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:34,620
I just have to keep trying.

294
00:21:34,905 --> 00:21:37,708
You need to be there for me, Girlfriend.

295
00:21:39,607 --> 00:21:41,577
I will not only be there for you

296
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:47,297
but I will walk with you.

297
00:21:47,828 --> 00:21:49,699
Whatever your new start is,

298
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,700
I will go with you.

299
00:21:54,722 --> 00:21:55,816
You don't need to do that.

300
00:21:56,262 --> 00:21:58,106
I don't want you to take a risk with me.

301
00:21:58,397 --> 00:22:01,102
It's not easy to build a startup company.

302
00:22:03,463 --> 00:22:04,699
Let me try it.

303
00:22:05,509 --> 00:22:07,604
I know it won't be easy.

304
00:22:08,525 --> 00:22:10,032
But how hard can it be?

305
00:22:13,097 --> 00:22:14,081
Silly.

306
00:22:17,447 --> 00:22:18,423
Thank you so much.

307
00:22:20,648 --> 00:22:21,702
I'm rooting for you.

308
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:26,106
I smooth out your hair for you.

309
00:22:27,525 --> 00:22:28,940
You are able to smile now.

310
00:22:33,668 --> 00:22:34,558
Alright.

311
00:22:34,574 --> 00:22:35,802
Let's give it a try.

312
00:22:42,088 --> 00:22:45,711
Good morning, my two beautiful ladies.

313
00:22:47,093 --> 00:22:50,816
Hello, my granddaughter who has never been home.

314
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:55,322
Grandma, I'm busy with work.

315
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:56,617
Don't lie to me.

316
00:22:56,875 --> 00:23:01,250
I know that you officially became unemployed.

317
00:23:02,254 --> 00:23:03,657
Grandma.

318
00:23:03,728 --> 00:23:05,607
You know the word "officially"?

319
00:23:06,106 --> 00:23:08,717
Now, you sound so trendy.

320
00:23:13,641 --> 00:23:14,817
I...

321
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:19,146
I am officially let go from the company.

322
00:23:20,863 --> 00:23:25,970
But we are starting again by building a startup.

323
00:23:26,367 --> 00:23:29,739
But I think you should also apply for a job.

324
00:23:30,025 --> 00:23:33,166
It's not like you can be good at building

325
00:23:33,191 --> 00:23:34,681
a startup right after you start.

326
00:23:35,709 --> 00:23:38,004
Alright, in the meantime,

327
00:23:38,321 --> 00:23:40,659
I will try to find a job or something to do.

328
00:23:41,804 --> 00:23:42,804
Good, baby.

329
00:23:43,277 --> 00:23:45,105
Go deliver the sweets.

330
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:46,656
Yes.

331
00:23:47,096 --> 00:23:48,205
Take this one too.

332
00:23:50,456 --> 00:23:51,620
Give it to me.

333
00:23:51,629 --> 00:23:53,837
- Alright. - Is this all?

334
00:23:53,848 --> 00:23:54,485
Hold them carefully.

335
00:23:54,491 --> 00:23:55,315
I'm leaving.

336
00:23:56,611 --> 00:23:57,405
Hey.

337
00:23:58,308 --> 00:23:59,810
Do you think she will be fine?

338
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:03,408
She is your granddaughter and my daughter.

339
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:05,408
Of course, she will be fine.

340
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:06,256
Right?

341
00:24:06,345 --> 00:24:07,108
That's right.

342
00:24:11,177 --> 00:24:13,142
Find a job.

343
00:24:14,155 --> 00:24:18,795
Where should I go find a job?

344
00:24:25,348 --> 00:24:26,308
Mr. Vee.

345
00:24:26,822 --> 00:24:28,022
What are you doing here?

346
00:24:28,275 --> 00:24:29,989
I told him to come to meet me.

347
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,404
We are waiting for you.

348
00:24:31,746 --> 00:24:33,982
So I can talk to you both at the same time.

349
00:24:36,045 --> 00:24:37,503
Come on. I'll help you.

350
00:24:37,831 --> 00:24:39,302
How are you? Are you tired?

351
00:24:46,748 --> 00:24:48,620
Here are your sweets, Aunt Noi.

352
00:24:51,204 --> 00:24:53,180
I'm sick of your lovey-dovey stuff.

353
00:25:01,715 --> 00:25:04,180
It's not easy to build a startup.

354
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:07,380
Especially with your reputation.

355
00:25:07,822 --> 00:25:10,379
No one in the industry believes in your credibility.

356
00:25:10,939 --> 00:25:12,979
I'll compete in application contests to find investors.

357
00:25:13,422 --> 00:25:15,708
Are you going to start from square one like a kid learning how to walk?

358
00:25:16,946 --> 00:25:17,780
Yes.

359
00:25:18,305 --> 00:25:20,805
I want to prove my ability to everyone.

360
00:25:21,109 --> 00:25:25,607
Joining contests is the easiest way to prove my worth to investors.

361
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:34,607
Today, I'm going to Next Innovation to talk about my investment.

362
00:25:35,435 --> 00:25:38,404
I'll let you know how it goes when I come back.

363
00:25:39,691 --> 00:25:40,808
Thank you.

364
00:25:41,321 --> 00:25:44,703
Mirin, you need to go to the company with me.

365
00:25:45,229 --> 00:25:46,011
Yes.

366
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:51,768
I want to meet the company's new CEO.

367
00:26:08,114 --> 00:26:10,700
I want to invite you to invest in Next Innovation.

368
00:26:11,109 --> 00:26:12,906
You will be able to get close to Veekit.

369
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,506
I'll do my best to help you

370
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,099
if you help me.

371
00:26:16,494 --> 00:26:21,057
Are you doing this to help me or for yourself?

372
00:26:21,765 --> 00:26:24,020
Who is the real you?

373
00:26:24,423 --> 00:26:29,109
Chanon, a sweet big brother who loves his cousin dearly

374
00:26:29,696 --> 00:26:34,814
or Chanon who only cares about his personal gain?

375
00:26:37,004 --> 00:26:38,454
If you want to be on top,

376
00:26:38,462 --> 00:26:40,383
sometimes, you need to step on others,

377
00:26:40,791 --> 00:26:42,407
even if that person is your family.

378
00:26:44,023 --> 00:26:45,616
I always admire you.

379
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,906
What about your grandfather,

380
00:26:49,877 --> 00:26:51,201
your company,

381
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,605
your cousin?

382
00:26:54,257 --> 00:26:55,700
Have they ever shown you any respect?

383
00:26:58,699 --> 00:27:02,419
We are going to work together to manage Next Innovation.

384
00:27:02,426 --> 00:27:04,856
We will take Next Innovation higher.

385
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:19,407
Today, you will work on the data breach problem, right?

386
00:27:21,077 --> 00:27:22,017
Yes.

387
00:27:22,364 --> 00:27:25,157
Today, I need to seriously review our financial statement

388
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:28,017
to see how much compensation we can pay to each user.

389
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,127
Make sure we will pay the lowest compensation to them,

390
00:27:35,608 --> 00:27:37,619
whether we pay it with our money or Tanya's.

391
00:27:38,579 --> 00:27:41,711
Most of them are insignificant people.

392
00:27:41,882 --> 00:27:43,106
They can't do anything to us.

393
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,299
You don't need to waste too much of your time and money on them.

394
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,500
We should save the money for something important to us.

395
00:27:49,515 --> 00:27:51,011
I'll think about it.

396
00:27:55,071 --> 00:27:58,413
For you, they may be insignificant people.

397
00:28:01,484 --> 00:28:03,505
But for me, they are my customers.

398
00:28:06,749 --> 00:28:08,008
I need to go to work.

399
00:28:19,404 --> 00:28:20,205
Come in.

400
00:28:29,594 --> 00:28:31,219
Hang in there, CEO.

401
00:28:32,241 --> 00:28:33,862
Thank you, my secretary.

402
00:28:34,157 --> 00:28:37,007
You have a meeting with Big Noi this afternoon.

403
00:28:37,136 --> 00:28:38,205
She asked to see you.

404
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,056
Big Noi?

405
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:45,820
She agreed to meet me only when I became the big boss.

406
00:28:46,325 --> 00:28:48,906
Do you want to play hard to get? I can tell her that you have a meeting.

407
00:28:49,634 --> 00:28:50,605
No.

408
00:28:50,974 --> 00:28:52,605
Let's talk to her and get it over with.

409
00:28:53,471 --> 00:28:54,909
I'm not going to work with her anyway.

410
00:28:55,281 --> 00:28:58,405
Aew-aes, can you schedule a meeting with Manit and Maewkwak for me?

411
00:28:58,478 --> 00:28:59,613
Roger that.

412
00:29:00,894 --> 00:29:02,860
Don't forget to eat this before going into a battle.

413
00:29:15,585 --> 00:29:16,466
I'm ready now.

414
00:29:17,342 --> 00:29:18,254
Go for it.

415
00:29:24,782 --> 00:29:25,537
Mom.

416
00:29:27,085 --> 00:29:27,814
Mom.

417
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,614
Mom.

418
00:29:38,462 --> 00:29:39,407
Mom.

419
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:41,705
Mom.

420
00:29:43,674 --> 00:29:44,605
Mom.

421
00:29:46,038 --> 00:29:46,551
Mom.

422
00:29:46,586 --> 00:29:47,309
Mom.

423
00:30:03,848 --> 00:30:04,805
Mom.

424
00:30:11,063 --> 00:30:12,139
Who are you?

425
00:30:15,324 --> 00:30:17,220
Where am I?

426
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:20,739
Why are my son's photos here?

427
00:30:21,081 --> 00:30:22,306
You...

428
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,817
Are you working for Sroyphet?

429
00:30:29,232 --> 00:30:30,505
No.

430
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:32,617
I'm Vee.

431
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:33,822
I'm Veekit.

432
00:30:34,715 --> 00:30:36,219
You are in my house.

433
00:30:36,362 --> 00:30:37,659
We are living together.

434
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:43,234
I...

435
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,284
Don't.

436
00:30:44,451 --> 00:30:45,069
Don't.

437
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:46,703
Don't.

438
00:30:48,225 --> 00:30:49,419
Don't come closer.

439
00:30:50,841 --> 00:30:51,902
Don't come closer.

440
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:05,779
Calm down, Mrs. Neeraaumpan.

441
00:31:06,757 --> 00:31:08,909
I'll go get your doctor.

442
00:31:26,789 --> 00:31:28,130
Hello, Big Noi.

443
00:31:28,148 --> 00:31:29,220
Hello.

444
00:31:29,644 --> 00:31:31,022
Hello, Mr. Chanon.

445
00:31:31,527 --> 00:31:32,408
Hello.

446
00:31:33,943 --> 00:31:35,014
Please have a seat.

447
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,222
I'm glad to officially meet you.

448
00:31:39,127 --> 00:31:40,309
I'm Chanon.

449
00:31:40,345 --> 00:31:41,202
Yes.

450
00:31:48,478 --> 00:31:52,100
Can you give me an update about the changes

451
00:31:52,111 --> 00:31:54,451
that occurred after Veekit resigned?

452
00:31:54,462 --> 00:31:56,408
What are we going to do next?

453
00:32:04,525 --> 00:32:07,002
This is the agreement that we have signed.

454
00:32:07,848 --> 00:32:12,205
It has the details of your investment that you gave to Veekit's project.

455
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,579
Can I be honest with you?

456
00:32:20,325 --> 00:32:21,211
Sure.

457
00:32:24,588 --> 00:32:27,617
I know that you don't like my management style.

458
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,977
I no longer want to work with someone who doesn't believe in me.

459
00:32:32,477 --> 00:32:33,500
So...

460
00:32:34,069 --> 00:32:37,616
I will be happy if you want to continue to support us.

461
00:32:38,736 --> 00:32:41,811
But I can tell that you feel uncomfortable with the situation.

462
00:32:42,303 --> 00:32:45,005
I don't mind if you want to cancel the contract.

463
00:32:48,708 --> 00:32:50,318
Did you discuss this with Mr. Prapop?

464
00:32:50,327 --> 00:32:53,502
I can make the decision by myself as the CEO of the company.

465
00:32:57,717 --> 00:32:59,108
I agree with your offer.

466
00:33:00,528 --> 00:33:02,503
I want to cancel the contract.

467
00:33:04,703 --> 00:33:05,937
This is good.

468
00:33:06,471 --> 00:33:08,711
We don't need to waste our time in discussing things.

469
00:33:09,877 --> 00:33:10,860
That's good.

470
00:33:10,957 --> 00:33:14,462
Aew-aes, can you prepare the paper for me?

471
00:33:15,028 --> 00:33:15,909
Sure.

472
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:20,014
I'll send the paper to you later, Big Noi.

473
00:33:20,325 --> 00:33:21,308
Sure.

474
00:33:22,106 --> 00:33:25,511
You can contact me through Mirin.

475
00:33:25,882 --> 00:33:28,942
I appointed her to take care of the matter until it's done.

476
00:33:29,463 --> 00:33:30,506
Sure.

477
00:33:32,248 --> 00:33:36,137
Mr. Chanon, I have some advice for you.

478
00:33:37,041 --> 00:33:38,208
Sure, Big Noi.

479
00:33:39,902 --> 00:33:46,703
Doing business with joy is better than doing it with hatred and fear.

480
00:33:55,269 --> 00:33:57,502
Big Noi wants the paper within this week.

481
00:33:57,613 --> 00:33:58,942
She will go abroad next week.

482
00:33:59,047 --> 00:34:01,345
Please hurry and get it ready by the time.

483
00:34:03,302 --> 00:34:04,105
Sure.

484
00:34:04,183 --> 00:34:05,103
Thank you.

485
00:34:17,577 --> 00:34:20,542
Aunt Noi, you look so cool earlier.

486
00:34:21,779 --> 00:34:23,528
Don't forget to tell Veekit about this.

487
00:34:23,991 --> 00:34:27,737
Tell him to prepare his presentation in English.

488
00:34:27,813 --> 00:34:30,140
I'm going to show it to investors overseas.

489
00:34:30,638 --> 00:34:31,714
Of course.

490
00:34:41,195 --> 00:34:42,176
Hello.

491
00:34:43,002 --> 00:34:44,176
Are you tired, Girlfriend?

492
00:34:44,192 --> 00:34:45,216
(A little.)

493
00:34:45,527 --> 00:34:47,216
(What about you? How are you doing?)

494
00:34:48,148 --> 00:34:49,607
My mom just fell asleep.

495
00:34:50,549 --> 00:34:52,103
(Did you have lunch?)

496
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:55,102
(Did you forget?)

497
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:05,200
Don't worry, Girlfriend.

498
00:35:05,379 --> 00:35:07,056
I'm going to eat it now.

499
00:35:07,555 --> 00:35:10,065
(If you don't send a photo of your lunch to me, you will be in trouble.)

500
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,010
Roger that.

501
00:35:13,884 --> 00:35:14,826
Can you end the call?

502
00:35:14,835 --> 00:35:16,231
My hands are busy.

503
00:35:16,297 --> 00:35:17,613
(Okay.)

504
00:35:48,863 --> 00:35:49,657
Aunt.

505
00:35:50,487 --> 00:35:52,057
Do you remember this place?

506
00:35:53,238 --> 00:35:54,903
This is your home.

507
00:35:57,207 --> 00:35:58,204
No.

508
00:36:00,594 --> 00:36:02,448
The house that you have in your memory.

509
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,708
It was the house that you lived decades ago.

510
00:36:05,306 --> 00:36:09,405
Now, you have moved to this house and live with your son.

511
00:36:12,404 --> 00:36:13,413
Veekit?

512
00:36:14,454 --> 00:36:15,413
That's right.

513
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:17,503
That's Veekit.

514
00:36:23,595 --> 00:36:26,019
He is all grown up now.

515
00:36:27,416 --> 00:36:28,800
Does he resemble his father?

516
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:43,911
Here.

517
00:36:46,232 --> 00:36:47,807
This is your photo with him.

518
00:36:49,662 --> 00:36:52,780
When your mom's memory returns,

519
00:36:53,413 --> 00:36:55,302
I want you to take a video of her.

520
00:36:56,262 --> 00:36:59,508
Ask her to talk about who she is,

521
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,500
who you are, and where she lives.

522
00:37:03,697 --> 00:37:07,297
In her case, she is stressed and anxious.

523
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,002
This can help her.

524
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,408
Vee.

525
00:37:12,748 --> 00:37:14,102
You need to prepare yourself.

526
00:37:14,869 --> 00:37:18,542
This disease is incurable.

527
00:37:19,274 --> 00:37:20,505
We can only palliate it.

528
00:37:23,093 --> 00:37:24,312
This is my advice

529
00:37:24,337 --> 00:37:26,668
for those who are taking care of patients with the disease.

530
00:37:26,693 --> 00:37:30,100
You may have chronic fatigue and stress.

531
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,139
I want you to monitor yourself and make sure to get some rest.

532
00:37:36,377 --> 00:37:37,223
Sure.

533
00:37:37,565 --> 00:37:38,694
I'll try.

534
00:37:38,708 --> 00:37:39,613
Fine.

535
00:37:39,662 --> 00:37:40,711
- See you - See you.

536
00:38:20,567 --> 00:38:22,001
Do you remember anything?

537
00:38:25,416 --> 00:38:27,105
I remember that...

538
00:38:34,137 --> 00:38:36,395
Sroyphet was mean to me.

539
00:38:43,162 --> 00:38:44,414
What did she do to you?

540
00:38:49,903 --> 00:38:51,580
You can tell me.

541
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:02,410
Directed by Ekkasit Trakulkasemsuk and Pantip Vibultham

542
00:39:11,545 --> 00:39:14,180
How can you leave me like this?

543
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,703
How will I live?

544
00:39:20,031 --> 00:39:21,382
It will be a hard life.

545
00:39:22,488 --> 00:39:23,780
It's too bad.

546
00:39:24,084 --> 00:39:26,179
You chose to use a shortcut to a comfortable life.

547
00:39:28,404 --> 00:39:29,604
How about this?

548
00:39:30,939 --> 00:39:32,402
Get out of this house.

549
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,780
I'll raise Veekit for you.

550
00:39:35,094 --> 00:39:37,595
Don't let him grow up with a gold digger like you.

551
00:39:39,456 --> 00:39:40,543
Sroy.

552
00:39:41,117 --> 00:39:42,506
Don't call me by my name.

553
00:39:42,893 --> 00:39:43,675
I'm not your family.

554
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,060
I never was and never will be.

555
00:39:47,736 --> 00:39:49,601
If you insist on staying here,

556
00:39:51,417 --> 00:39:53,902
I'll kill you and your son.

557
00:40:03,754 --> 00:40:06,709
After your dad married me and we had you,

558
00:40:06,721 --> 00:40:08,071
you are...

559
00:40:08,082 --> 00:40:10,506
I am the direct descendant, right?

560
00:40:10,928 --> 00:40:14,339
I never knew about the direct or indirect descendant.

561
00:40:14,441 --> 00:40:16,060
I never cared about it.

562
00:40:16,075 --> 00:40:20,109
All I know is that you are my brother.

563
00:40:20,327 --> 00:40:22,256
Can I ask Mr. Prapop?

564
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:25,724
What is your position in the company besides the founder?

565
00:40:26,872 --> 00:40:29,408
I will take Next Innovation higher.

566
00:40:29,564 --> 00:40:31,460
It has been stuck in the same place for too long.

567
00:40:31,715 --> 00:40:33,940
I'm worried that the game may get even worse.

568
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:36,928
From her attitude at the press conference

569
00:40:36,937 --> 00:40:40,093
To be honest, I don't trust Tanya.

570
00:40:40,297 --> 00:40:41,829
Do you think this company is yours?

571
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,911
Of course.

572
00:40:43,026 --> 00:40:44,108
Why not?

573
00:40:44,194 --> 00:40:46,940
The shares that I have and the money that I've invested,

574
00:40:47,068 --> 00:40:48,859
They are not different from what the CEO has.

575
00:40:48,874 --> 00:40:50,859
Stop it, Tanya.

576
00:40:52,548 --> 00:40:53,416
I'm sorry.

577
00:40:54,881 --> 00:40:56,708
I didn't mean it to happen.

578
00:40:57,001 --> 00:41:00,300
I will be relieved if you are the one who takes care of Next.

579
00:41:01,702 --> 00:41:03,497
I can't let Tanya have it.
