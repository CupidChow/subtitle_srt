00:00:00,105 --> 00:00:01,610
I am a disabled person.

2
00:00:02,179 --> 00:00:03,583
I have…

3
00:00:03,992 --> 00:00:05,305
Face blindness.

4
00:00:05,831 --> 00:00:08,382
I’ll look through your business plan.

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,706
If it piques my interest, I’ll contact you.

6
00:00:13,145 --> 00:00:18,706
I do hope your investor isn’t so loaded that even I can’t compete with.

7
00:00:18,891 --> 00:00:21,011
If Miss Tanya and Mr. Chanon work together,

8
00:00:21,026 --> 00:00:23,118
the board of directors will surely acknowledge them.

9
00:00:23,145 --> 00:00:25,140
Aunt Noi hasn’t gotten back to us.

10
00:00:25,171 --> 00:00:26,207
I already did.

11
00:00:27,829 --> 00:00:29,000
I couldn’t reach her.

12
00:00:29,177 --> 00:00:29,844
Let’s not wait for Aunt Noi—

13
00:00:29,853 --> 00:00:31,016
I’ll wait.

14
00:00:32,914 --> 00:00:36,339
Big Noi is the only investor I want.

15
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,810
Jirawat Sutivanichsak

16
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:59,130

THE SECRET WAITING TO STING

22
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,451
Next is launching a new international application

23
00:02:14,476 --> 00:02:15,882
created by Thai developers.

24
00:02:15,906 --> 00:02:19,229
Next Smart collects medical data across the world.

25
00:02:19,241 --> 00:02:21,973
Videos related to the medical field can be uploaded onto the app.

26
00:03:09,813 --> 00:03:10,608
Hey.

27
00:03:11,053 --> 00:03:12,025
Get in the car.

28
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:16,155
How do you know that I’m here?

29
00:03:16,315 --> 00:03:18,702
Big Noi hasn’t contacted us yet.

30
00:03:18,805 --> 00:03:21,114
It isn’t hard to guess where you would be.

31
00:03:21,682 --> 00:03:22,819
Get in.

32
00:03:35,211 --> 00:03:38,499
I’m so stressed that my eyebrows are knitted.

33
00:03:38,811 --> 00:03:39,400
Huh?

34
00:03:39,684 --> 00:03:40,508
Really?

35
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,608
Let me see.

36
00:03:45,231 --> 00:03:47,407
It’s a metaphor.

37
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,011
Aren’t you feeling stressed about it?

38
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,659
Hey.

39
00:03:54,477 --> 00:03:55,817
It’s useless to stress about it.

40
00:03:55,828 --> 00:03:56,777
Why would you do it?

41
00:03:57,954 --> 00:03:59,300
If we will fail,

42
00:03:59,617 --> 00:04:00,808
then shall it be.

43
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,305
You are trying to act cool.

44
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:07,499
I’m so stressed that I have stomach pain.

45
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,214
Let’s go.

46
00:04:46,005 --> 00:04:47,419
Miss Tanya and Mr. Chanon.

47
00:04:56,108 --> 00:04:57,896
Good morning, Veekit.

48
00:05:00,586 --> 00:05:01,817
Good morning.

49
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,299
Where is your investor?

50
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,259
You look relaxed.

51
00:05:10,948 --> 00:05:13,004
I guess you are confident.

52
00:05:15,017 --> 00:05:16,179
To be honest,

53
00:05:16,432 --> 00:05:19,940
I am extremely nervous.

54
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:24,703
I know that you and Tanya

55
00:05:25,248 --> 00:05:26,703
will be a great team.

56
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,013
But...

57
00:05:31,177 --> 00:05:32,899
Mirin and I are also a great team.

58
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:35,933
When we work together,

59
00:05:36,549 --> 00:05:38,019
we look so cool.

60
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:41,709
See you in the meeting room.

61
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,897
When I told you two to go find new investors,

62
00:05:55,145 --> 00:05:56,862
I expected you to do everything

63
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,502
to make sure that the seat wouldn’t be empty.

64
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:01,980
Isn’t it tiring, Veekit?

65
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,909
Chanon was not there to help you this time.

66
00:06:11,001 --> 00:06:11,902
Let’s start.

67
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,902
Hello, everyone.

68
00:06:14,143 --> 00:06:17,896
The investor that I attracted is Tanya Kanokkul.

69
00:06:18,394 --> 00:06:21,016
I believe you all know her.

70
00:06:21,823 --> 00:06:24,731
She is willing to invest with us under any conditions.

71
00:06:27,075 --> 00:06:29,820
I’m also willing to invest with Veekit,

72
00:06:31,555 --> 00:06:33,099
if you still can’t find any investors.

73
00:06:35,054 --> 00:06:37,503
I think we will have no problem with that if Veekit…

74
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:44,857
I think Miss Tanya is likely to work well with Chanon’s policy.

75
00:06:47,299 --> 00:06:49,508
I’ll find another investor after this.

76
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,005
Wait.

77
00:06:52,297 --> 00:06:54,502
The seat next to you is empty today.

78
00:06:55,509 --> 00:06:58,810
What else will be empty in the future, Veekit?

79
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,608
I’m sorry for being late.

80
00:07:08,103 --> 00:07:10,339
I woke up with back pain this morning.

81
00:07:10,349 --> 00:07:12,260
So I went to see a doctor before coming here.

82
00:07:13,597 --> 00:07:14,500
I’m sorry.

83
00:07:14,731 --> 00:07:17,817
This woman didn’t listen to me and barged into the room.

84
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:19,020
You can leave.

85
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,109
Please have a seat.

86
00:07:21,146 --> 00:07:22,115
Thank you.

87
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:26,474
Mirin, aren’t you coming here to help me?

88
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,007
Yes.

89
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,585
Thanks.

90
00:07:44,072 --> 00:07:45,176
Vee.

91
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:50,219
Introduce your investor to everyone.

92
00:07:51,377 --> 00:07:52,281
Yes.

93
00:07:54,327 --> 00:07:55,308
Everyone.

94
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,619
This is my investor.

95
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,302
Big Noi.

96
00:08:13,097 --> 00:08:14,408
Everyone,

97
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:19,309
May you excuse us? I need to talk to Prapop privately.

98
00:08:42,721 --> 00:08:43,560
How are you?

99
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,854
- I’m fine. - Long time no see.

100
00:08:47,266 --> 00:08:50,462
So you got Big Noi for real.

101
00:08:51,207 --> 00:08:52,857
I’ll need to give Mirin credit for this.

102
00:08:55,714 --> 00:08:58,002
I shouldn’t let you go to Veekit.

103
00:08:59,632 --> 00:09:00,496
Good job.

104
00:09:00,511 --> 00:09:03,180
You must be good at taking other people’s credit.

105
00:09:03,389 --> 00:09:06,939
I can’t believe that you would know an influential person like her.

106
00:09:07,395 --> 00:09:10,709
Did you know her when you cleaned for her?

107
00:09:10,728 --> 00:09:12,081
Miss Tanya!

108
00:09:12,607 --> 00:09:16,318
I saw you obediently rushed to help her.

109
00:09:17,448 --> 00:09:18,894
Or…

110
00:09:19,751 --> 00:09:20,894
Did you work as her maid?

111
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:22,016
Tanya.

112
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,503
Why?

113
00:09:23,853 --> 00:09:24,782
What’s wrong?

114
00:09:24,805 --> 00:09:26,407
I’m not okay that

115
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:30,603
your grandfather let that old woman tell me to get out.

116
00:09:30,902 --> 00:09:34,499
I’m here as an investor as well.

117
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:36,309
Why isn’t he considerate of my reputation?

118
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:40,903
My grandfather probably can tell that you are here to kill time,

119
00:09:41,302 --> 00:09:42,980
instead of taking this investment seriously.

120
00:09:45,222 --> 00:09:47,457
Whether I do it to kill time or I am serious about it,

121
00:09:47,731 --> 00:09:49,259
I have money for the investment.

122
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:53,128
Miss Tanya, please calm down.

123
00:09:53,137 --> 00:09:54,810
Mirin, you should keep your mouth shut.

124
00:09:54,829 --> 00:09:55,776
Stop it.

125
00:09:56,225 --> 00:09:58,022
You have no right to order my secretary.

126
00:09:58,047 --> 00:09:58,902
Do you hear me?

127
00:09:59,445 --> 00:10:01,008
Tanya, that’s enough.

128
00:10:01,897 --> 00:10:02,927
One told me to stop.

129
00:10:02,945 --> 00:10:04,106
The other told me that it was enough.

130
00:10:04,257 --> 00:10:06,183
You two are very protective of her.

131
00:10:12,991 --> 00:10:14,899
You are good at pretending to be fragile.

132
00:10:15,499 --> 00:10:17,906
You are flirting with your bosses like this.

133
00:10:18,789 --> 00:10:20,004
May I ask?

134
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:22,619
Who do you have your eyes on, the big brother or the little brother?

135
00:10:23,014 --> 00:10:24,137
Miss Tanya.

136
00:10:25,551 --> 00:10:27,016
Chanon, Veekit, come in.

137
00:10:29,137 --> 00:10:30,056
- Yes. - Yes.

138
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:31,702
Keep your voice down.

139
00:10:32,189 --> 00:10:33,659
This is in front of the meeting room.

140
00:10:34,392 --> 00:10:35,542
I’m sorry.

141
00:10:41,428 --> 00:10:42,407
Mirin.

142
00:10:43,082 --> 00:10:44,419
Go wait in my office.

143
00:11:02,522 --> 00:11:04,099
Don’t run away like this.

144
00:11:05,077 --> 00:11:06,302
I’m not running away.

145
00:11:06,577 --> 00:11:09,404
I just don’t want to carry this on because it’s useless.

146
00:11:10,509 --> 00:11:14,306
Don’t think that you can say anything to me because Veekit takes your side.

147
00:11:15,314 --> 00:11:17,302
I never had such a thought.

148
00:11:17,512 --> 00:11:18,490
You should stop.

149
00:11:18,842 --> 00:11:20,300
You are the one who needs to stop.

150
00:11:20,871 --> 00:11:23,297
Resign as Veekit’s secretary

151
00:11:23,802 --> 00:11:26,402
Why do I need to follow your order?

152
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,300
If you don’t do it,

153
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:31,700
I’ll do everything to harass you.

154
00:11:32,202 --> 00:11:34,607
I’ll make sure you will be kicked out like a loser.

155
00:11:36,057 --> 00:11:37,108
Make your choice.

156
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:49,059
Big Noi is going to be a shareholder in our new applications

157
00:11:49,189 --> 00:11:51,108
for both Chanon and Veekit.

158
00:11:52,816 --> 00:11:56,577
Non, bring your business plan to discuss with me.

159
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,503
I’ll have you and Tanya start a new project.

160
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:03,302
I don’t want to disappoint her since she wants to work with us.

161
00:12:06,555 --> 00:12:08,862
Thank you so much for believing in me.

162
00:12:09,352 --> 00:12:11,540
I believe in your good intentions.

163
00:12:12,391 --> 00:12:13,942
I’m telling you.

164
00:12:14,315 --> 00:12:16,106
From now on,

165
00:12:16,407 --> 00:12:21,459
I’ll take part in every step of the project’s planning.

166
00:12:23,497 --> 00:12:25,057
I’m ready for it, Big Noi.

167
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:29,579
You must be happy to have such a talented grandson.

168
00:12:30,637 --> 00:12:31,508
Excuse me.

169
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:41,005
Big Noi, thank you for investing in my company

170
00:12:41,611 --> 00:12:44,208
and working with my grandson.

171
00:12:47,654 --> 00:12:49,100
You’re welcome.

172
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:01,408
(You are flirting with your bosses like this.)

173
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,912
(May I ask?)

174
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,208
(Who do you have your eyes on, the big brother or the little brother?)

175
00:13:06,337 --> 00:13:07,709
You, sharp-tongued brat!

176
00:13:07,945 --> 00:13:09,508
There must be only nasty thoughts in your head.

177
00:13:11,623 --> 00:13:12,780
What are you doing up here?

178
00:13:13,997 --> 00:13:15,180
Mr. Chanon.

179
00:13:15,637 --> 00:13:19,613
The key person in getting a large investment for Next Innovation,

180
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:21,804
what are you doing here?

181
00:13:23,694 --> 00:13:26,200
I’m feeling a bit frustrated.

182
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,305
So I came to find a quiet place to calm myself down.

183
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:35,580
But this is where I come to take a breather.

184
00:13:35,998 --> 00:13:37,602
Really?

185
00:13:38,308 --> 00:13:39,414
I’m sorry.

186
00:13:39,429 --> 00:13:40,303
I won’t bother you anymore.

187
00:13:40,314 --> 00:13:41,617
It’s okay.

188
00:13:41,874 --> 00:13:43,005
I can share it with you.

189
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:51,059
It’s stunning here in the evening.

190
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:01,118
Don’t pay attention to Tanya’s words.

191
00:14:03,657 --> 00:14:04,604
Yes.

192
00:14:04,937 --> 00:14:06,205
I don’t like what she said.

193
00:14:06,469 --> 00:14:08,400
I try to ignore it.

194
00:14:11,487 --> 00:14:15,057
I know that you two don’t have feelings for me.

195
00:14:16,517 --> 00:14:17,457
How do you know?

196
00:14:19,253 --> 00:14:20,296
What?

197
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,130
Are you sure

198
00:14:23,918 --> 00:14:25,208
that I don’t have feelings for you?

199
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:47,705
Mirin.

200
00:14:48,385 --> 00:14:50,204
Go make two cups of hot chocolate.

201
00:14:50,531 --> 00:14:51,800
Let’s celebrate.

202
00:14:55,798 --> 00:14:56,979
Don’t you hear me, deafie?

203
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,509
Where is she?

204
00:15:25,656 --> 00:15:28,391
Why the hell didn’t she take her phone with her?

205
00:15:28,411 --> 00:15:29,702
She disobeys my order.

206
00:15:29,917 --> 00:15:31,780
I told her to wait in my office.

207
00:15:33,376 --> 00:15:37,219
Mirin!

208
00:15:41,448 --> 00:15:42,448
I will no longer bother your time.

209
00:15:42,462 --> 00:15:43,650
You probably want to be alone.

210
00:15:43,669 --> 00:15:45,182
Excuse me. I should go back to work.

211
00:16:00,379 --> 00:16:02,408
Mr. Non, did you close the door?

212
00:16:02,779 --> 00:16:03,820
Oh!

213
00:16:03,954 --> 00:16:05,299
Yes, I forgot.

214
00:16:06,204 --> 00:16:06,973
It’s okay.

215
00:16:06,988 --> 00:16:08,900
I’ll call Aew-aes and tell her to open the door.

216
00:16:16,103 --> 00:16:17,300
Hello, Aew-aes.

217
00:16:17,537 --> 00:16:18,820
Can you…

218
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:24,822
My battery is dead.

219
00:16:27,124 --> 00:16:29,005
I forgot to charge it last night.

220
00:16:29,561 --> 00:16:30,502
You should call her.

221
00:16:30,915 --> 00:16:31,715
What?

222
00:16:33,045 --> 00:16:35,060
Call Aew-aes and tell her to open the door.

223
00:16:39,877 --> 00:16:42,259
I don’t have my phone with me.

224
00:16:43,804 --> 00:16:44,663
Mirin.

225
00:16:49,463 --> 00:16:50,204
Wait.

226
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,057
Does this mean we are stuck in here?

227
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:54,611
Mm-hmm.

228
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:01,805
If we shout, will someone hear us?

229
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,105
What do you think?

230
00:17:19,654 --> 00:17:20,423
Aew-aes.

231
00:17:20,952 --> 00:17:22,220
Do you see Mirin?

232
00:17:23,506 --> 00:17:24,503
No.

233
00:17:33,466 --> 00:17:34,509
Where is Non?

234
00:17:35,757 --> 00:17:37,448
He went somewhere.

235
00:17:37,466 --> 00:17:39,423
He called me earlier but the call was disconnected.

236
00:17:39,438 --> 00:17:40,808
I guess his phone is out of battery.

237
00:17:40,841 --> 00:17:41,740
Where did he go?

238
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:44,140
I think…

239
00:17:44,158 --> 00:17:45,204
Don’t think.

240
00:17:46,327 --> 00:17:47,650
Where did he go?

241
00:17:50,217 --> 00:17:51,740
I think we went to the rooftop.

242
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:59,506
What should we do?

243
00:18:02,025 --> 00:18:04,740
We have to wait for a guard to patrol the building in the evening.

244
00:18:05,382 --> 00:18:07,140
We should wait by the door.

245
00:18:24,423 --> 00:18:26,336
Do you often come here to take a breather?

246
00:18:28,351 --> 00:18:29,940
Not as often as Veekit does.

247
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:34,737
I only take a breather when I feel very down or tired.

248
00:18:35,371 --> 00:18:39,306
I’m not the type who can take a long breather.

249
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:41,940
Taking a break for twenty minutes is considered too long for me.

250
00:18:51,108 --> 00:18:53,207
You don’t need to be that worried about me.

251
00:18:54,348 --> 00:18:55,407
I’m sorry.

252
00:18:55,945 --> 00:18:57,008
You don’t need to apologize.

253
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:59,008
It’s not a bad thing.

254
00:19:00,733 --> 00:19:03,000
I’m just afraid it will make me good.

255
00:19:18,162 --> 00:19:19,509
Are you doing okay?

256
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:21,422
About working with Veekit.

257
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,420
Yes.

258
00:19:23,554 --> 00:19:25,405
I adjusted to it.

259
00:19:26,288 --> 00:19:28,016
Thank you so much.

260
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,819
If you didn’t help me that day,

261
00:19:30,062 --> 00:19:32,600
I don’t know what I would be doing today.

262
00:19:33,345 --> 00:19:35,400
You might become my secretary.

263
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,611
I would offer you the job.

264
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:43,659
But Aew-aes is still my no.1 secretary.

265
00:19:44,758 --> 00:19:45,650
Yes.

266
00:19:45,755 --> 00:19:46,706
Of course.

267
00:19:46,905 --> 00:19:48,579
How can I compete with her?

268
00:19:49,998 --> 00:19:53,062
Veekit is lucky to have you.

269
00:19:54,411 --> 00:19:56,007
You can fulfill all his demands.

270
00:19:56,816 --> 00:19:58,860
You also make him smile.

271
00:19:59,186 --> 00:20:01,007
It was huge news in the company the other day

272
00:20:01,391 --> 00:20:03,404
that Veekit smiled and complimented our staff.

273
00:20:06,749 --> 00:20:08,459
I wish I was as lucky as he is.

274
00:20:12,219 --> 00:20:13,620
At least in something.

275
00:20:22,075 --> 00:20:23,213
I told you.

276
00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:26,008
You don’t need to be that worried about me.

277
00:20:26,709 --> 00:20:28,008
I’m sorry.

278
00:20:28,469 --> 00:20:29,402
I’m kidding.

279
00:20:42,776 --> 00:20:43,807
It’s okay.

280
00:20:50,176 --> 00:20:51,810
I only need to control my feelings.

281
00:21:03,133 --> 00:21:04,259
Mirin.

282
00:21:05,971 --> 00:21:06,902
Mr. Vee.

283
00:21:07,185 --> 00:21:08,231
I’m here.

284
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,059
Mr. Vee.

285
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,506
Mirin.

286
00:21:17,248 --> 00:21:20,580
Why are you here with my secretary?

287
00:21:22,828 --> 00:21:23,807
Is this…

288
00:21:24,269 --> 00:21:26,100
…your plan to steal my secretary?

289
00:21:26,475 --> 00:21:27,300
Wait.

290
00:21:27,668 --> 00:21:29,208
I came here separately.

291
00:21:29,638 --> 00:21:31,522
She was already here when I came.

292
00:21:34,746 --> 00:21:35,699
Already?

293
00:21:37,484 --> 00:21:40,205
Why did you come up here?

294
00:21:41,331 --> 00:21:43,488
Why didn’t you take your phone with you?

295
00:21:43,503 --> 00:21:44,542
I can’t contact you.

296
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:47,829
I…

297
00:21:49,377 --> 00:21:50,551
Hurry and go down.

298
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:52,208
I want to drink hot chocolate.

299
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,816
Go make it for me now.

300
00:22:13,816 --> 00:22:15,056
You were stuck there with him for some time.

301
00:22:16,328 --> 00:22:17,380
What did you two do?

302
00:22:18,997 --> 00:22:20,022
We talked.

303
00:22:20,474 --> 00:22:21,607
We were talking.

304
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:23,124
About what?

305
00:22:23,131 --> 00:22:25,339
It’s just a typical conversation.

306
00:22:25,865 --> 00:22:28,604
But there’s something that I can’t tell you.

307
00:22:29,154 --> 00:22:30,702
It’s Chanon’s secret.

308
00:22:31,638 --> 00:22:32,702
You can tell me.

309
00:22:33,549 --> 00:22:35,459
Chanon and I have no secrets to each other.

310
00:22:36,303 --> 00:22:37,382
I can’t tell you.

311
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:41,201
Sit down.

312
00:22:44,103 --> 00:22:45,340
You can tell me.

313
00:22:45,703 --> 00:22:46,682
Tell me.

314
00:22:46,694 --> 00:22:47,608
Hurry up.

315
00:22:48,374 --> 00:22:49,614
I am your boss.

316
00:22:56,844 --> 00:22:57,805
Fine.

317
00:23:04,365 --> 00:23:05,702
Actually,

318
00:23:06,423 --> 00:23:09,600
I have financial documents that I need to check.

319
00:23:12,394 --> 00:23:17,460
Since I have a talented secretary like you,

320
00:23:19,173 --> 00:23:21,505
You, secret keeper.

321
00:23:22,118 --> 00:23:23,303
You will do the document checking.

322
00:23:23,885 --> 00:23:24,709
Okay?

323
00:23:29,177 --> 00:23:32,940
I need to stay here until you check all the documents.

324
00:23:34,136 --> 00:23:35,340
You can’t go anywhere.

325
00:23:35,802 --> 00:23:36,960
You can’t go to the restroom.

326
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:42,697
Unless you tell me what you and Non talked about.

327
00:23:43,254 --> 00:23:44,708
I may reduce your penalty.

328
00:23:45,105 --> 00:23:46,208
You are a dictator.

329
00:23:46,265 --> 00:23:47,002
Huh?

330
00:23:47,502 --> 00:23:48,691
Documents?

331
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:49,933
You want more documents?

332
00:23:49,945 --> 00:23:51,108
- Okay. - Wait.

333
00:23:52,047 --> 00:23:53,405
This is more than enough.

334
00:24:30,533 --> 00:24:36,339
I started to want to steal your secretary, Veekit.

335
00:24:41,435 --> 00:24:43,001
How was the meeting?

336
00:24:45,389 --> 00:24:46,706
I don’t think it went well.

337
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:49,339
Chanon looked very upset.

338
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:53,182
Will we lose our jobs?

339
00:24:54,026 --> 00:24:55,902
It’s not easy to find a new job.

340
00:24:57,434 --> 00:24:59,408
Working in this company is also not easy.

341
00:25:00,001 --> 00:25:01,100
What else do you need to be worried about?

342
00:25:02,143 --> 00:25:04,002
What’s the point of complaining about it?

343
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,017
Actually, I have a simple task for you.

344
00:25:09,998 --> 00:25:10,805
What is it?

345
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,708
Load paper into the printer.

346
00:25:20,395 --> 00:25:22,001
The simple task is

347
00:25:22,404 --> 00:25:23,800
printing these documents.

348
00:25:24,762 --> 00:25:26,105
Please take care of the rest.

349
00:25:26,786 --> 00:25:27,906
I’m taking a coffee break.

350
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,706
Wait.

351
00:25:31,565 --> 00:25:32,708
What the heck?

352
00:25:35,435 --> 00:25:36,506
Luckily,

353
00:25:36,937 --> 00:25:38,804
the new printer is easy to use.

354
00:25:39,155 --> 00:25:40,737
Otherwise, I wouldn’t do it for you.

355
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,900
Why is she bending down her head so low?

356
00:26:39,586 --> 00:26:40,608
Is she sleeping?

357
00:27:00,416 --> 00:27:01,200
Ouch!

358
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,303
Mr. Vee.

359
00:27:04,718 --> 00:27:06,260
It’s me, Nok, your maid.

360
00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:08,305
Yes.

361
00:27:08,465 --> 00:27:09,280
What do you want?

362
00:27:09,293 --> 00:27:13,305
I came to check if you left home without turning off the lights.

363
00:27:16,521 --> 00:27:18,860
Why did you push me that hard?

364
00:27:19,028 --> 00:27:20,860
I just fell asleep for a short while.

365
00:27:21,004 --> 00:27:22,219
It’s like being pushed by a wild elephant.

366
00:27:22,385 --> 00:27:23,211
What?

367
00:27:23,235 --> 00:27:24,217
Look at you.

368
00:27:24,339 --> 00:27:26,617
I thought you took a sedative for elephants, sleepyhead.

369
00:27:27,622 --> 00:27:29,915
When I finish my work, I’ll turn off the lights.

370
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:30,721
Alright.

371
00:27:30,737 --> 00:27:32,819
Excuse me.

372
00:27:37,731 --> 00:27:38,702
Hey, you.

373
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,404
Don’t talk back to me in front of other people.

374
00:27:40,413 --> 00:27:41,339
Do you get it?

375
00:27:41,709 --> 00:27:43,509
Otherwise, they will start to talk back to me as well.

376
00:27:45,542 --> 00:27:46,663
I didn’t talk back to you.

377
00:27:46,842 --> 00:27:48,607
You pushed me very hard.

378
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:50,386
If I have an internal injury, I’ll sue you.

379
00:27:50,397 --> 00:27:51,459
Oh.

380
00:27:51,773 --> 00:27:52,659
Then sue me.

381
00:27:52,862 --> 00:27:54,804
See you in court, big mouth.

382
00:27:55,244 --> 00:27:56,103
Fine.

383
00:27:56,362 --> 00:27:58,657
Tell your secretary to wait for a summon.

384
00:27:58,674 --> 00:28:00,201
My secretary?

385
00:28:00,783 --> 00:28:02,940
You are my secretary, fool.

386
00:28:04,961 --> 00:28:07,001
You seem to no longer be functioning.

387
00:28:07,047 --> 00:28:08,502
You should go home.

388
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,402
You are autopiloting and talking nonsense.

389
00:28:22,343 --> 00:28:24,820
Non, you are still here?

390
00:28:25,466 --> 00:28:26,890
I fell asleep shortly.

391
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:28,602
I didn’t get much sleep lately.

392
00:28:29,411 --> 00:28:30,105
So did we.

393
00:28:30,118 --> 00:28:31,308
We just woke up.

394
00:28:31,317 --> 00:28:32,111
Huh?

395
00:28:32,226 --> 00:28:33,380
Did you two sleep together?

396
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:36,980
No, not that kind of sleep.

397
00:28:37,727 --> 00:28:39,257
Let’s say…

398
00:28:39,691 --> 00:28:44,508
someone had a sound sleep while the other fell asleep while working.

399
00:28:46,805 --> 00:28:48,177
That’s Veekit’s expertise.

400
00:28:48,517 --> 00:28:49,140
Hey!

401
00:29:14,965 --> 00:29:16,503
You are the trapped.

402
00:29:17,096 --> 00:29:18,158
You were trapped on the rooftop.

403
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:18,866
You are now trapped in the elevator.

404
00:29:18,875 --> 00:29:20,306
You are trapped everywhere.

405
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:23,097
How is that my fault?

406
00:29:23,114 --> 00:29:24,899
You should do good deeds

407
00:29:25,171 --> 00:29:27,737
by releasing captured animals like birds or fish.

408
00:29:27,746 --> 00:29:29,213
So your life won’t have many obstacles.

409
00:29:31,481 --> 00:29:33,740
I’m not the only one who is unlucky here.

410
00:29:34,131 --> 00:29:35,804
We are all trapped in here together.

411
00:29:40,714 --> 00:29:41,604
(Hello.)

412
00:29:42,062 --> 00:29:43,001
Hello.

413
00:29:43,139 --> 00:29:44,306
The elevator is stuck.

414
00:29:45,085 --> 00:29:47,619
(Alright. I’ll send technicians to you.)

415
00:29:48,145 --> 00:29:49,220
Thank you.

416
00:29:56,032 --> 00:29:56,908
The trapped.

417
00:29:59,794 --> 00:30:00,801
The complainer.

418
00:30:01,848 --> 00:30:02,900
The trapped.

419
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:04,109
The complainer.

420
00:30:04,131 --> 00:30:04,680
The trapped.

421
00:30:04,699 --> 00:30:05,288
The complainer.

422
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:05,767
The trapped.

423
00:30:05,776 --> 00:30:06,219
The complainer.

424
00:30:06,234 --> 00:30:06,702
The trapped.

425
00:30:06,711 --> 00:30:07,143
The complainer.

426
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:07,445
The trapped.

427
00:30:07,453 --> 00:30:07,768
The complainer.

428
00:30:07,774 --> 00:30:08,361
- The trapped. - The complainer.

429
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:10,202
I guess I’m the third wheel.

430
00:30:15,388 --> 00:30:16,702
Do you feel slighted?

431
00:30:31,013 --> 00:30:32,601
(The elevator is working now.)

432
00:30:39,096 --> 00:30:41,505
You haven’t answered my question.

433
00:30:42,117 --> 00:30:43,337
Do you feel slighted?

434
00:31:03,768 --> 00:31:05,300
I don’t feel slighted.

435
00:31:10,674 --> 00:31:12,105
I feel frustrated.

436
00:31:27,699 --> 00:31:29,807
His voice sounds serious.

437
00:31:30,506 --> 00:31:32,100
What is his facial expression?

438
00:31:33,268 --> 00:31:34,706
He looks…

439
00:31:35,259 --> 00:31:36,662
…serious

440
00:31:38,691 --> 00:31:40,256
Very serious.

441
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:14,105
Mrs. Sroyphet.

442
00:32:14,912 --> 00:32:16,705
I found something interesting.

443
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,450
[Application for Employment – Mirin Paisarnpisai]

444
00:32:30,653 --> 00:32:33,137
Rin, have you had dinner?

445
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:35,137
No.

446
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,911
I’ll find something in the fridge to eat.

447
00:32:39,091 --> 00:32:40,422
How is your work?

448
00:32:40,887 --> 00:32:42,197
It goes well.

449
00:32:42,213 --> 00:32:44,699
Aunt Noi appeared at the last minute.

450
00:32:44,872 --> 00:32:48,139
My heart almost stopped.

451
00:32:48,402 --> 00:32:50,536
She looked so cool.

452
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:53,201
All the executives seemed to be very satisfied.

453
00:32:54,351 --> 00:32:55,456
Good.

454
00:32:55,783 --> 00:32:58,377
Now you can resign.

455
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,202
You successfully helped him.

456
00:33:03,703 --> 00:33:05,001
I…

457
00:33:06,994 --> 00:33:08,499
You are hesitating, aren’t you?

458
00:33:08,764 --> 00:33:11,005
You don’t want to resign. Is it because this is your job

459
00:33:11,634 --> 00:33:13,613
or do you have another reason?

460
00:33:20,084 --> 00:33:22,202
You used his mother’s name to apply for the job.

461
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:25,899
You know where his mother is but you can’t tell him.

462
00:33:26,485 --> 00:33:28,711
Though it’s because of the promise you made with his mother.

463
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,505
He won’t listen to it.

464
00:33:36,733 --> 00:33:37,709
Alright, Mom.

465
00:33:38,177 --> 00:33:41,505
I’ll tell Auntie Nee tomorrow.

466
00:33:42,093 --> 00:33:45,802
She asked me to tell her about her son’s life.

467
00:33:47,045 --> 00:33:50,108
I should tell her before I resign.

468
00:33:51,546 --> 00:33:52,582
That’s good.

469
00:33:52,595 --> 00:33:53,500
You should tell her soon.

470
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:55,500
If someone finds out,

471
00:33:55,995 --> 00:33:57,980
you will be in trouble.

472
00:33:59,145 --> 00:34:00,380
You did wrong.

473
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:03,980
You shouldn’t prolong it for too long.

474
00:34:51,192 --> 00:34:52,109
Auntie Nee.

475
00:34:55,887 --> 00:34:57,420
Here is your cake.

476
00:34:57,534 --> 00:34:59,503
My mom did her best to make it for you.

477
00:35:00,601 --> 00:35:01,607
Thank you.

478
00:35:16,065 --> 00:35:17,459
These are Veekit’s photos.

479
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,311
Auntie Nee.

480
00:35:40,582 --> 00:35:45,576
I will no longer be able to take his photos for you.

481
00:35:48,555 --> 00:35:49,697
Why?

482
00:35:52,376 --> 00:35:53,601
Well,

483
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:56,420
I…

484
00:35:56,851 --> 00:35:58,204
I’m resigning.

485
00:36:02,062 --> 00:36:04,469
I used the wrong way to get the job.

486
00:36:04,487 --> 00:36:06,305
I don’t deserve to keep it.

487
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:10,914
This has nothing to do with Veekit.

488
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,008
He is a good boss and a nice person.

489
00:36:14,054 --> 00:36:16,008
I learned a lot from him.

490
00:36:16,122 --> 00:36:19,739
I don’t know how close you are with him.

491
00:36:23,324 --> 00:36:24,709
I don’t know

492
00:36:26,229 --> 00:36:28,217
if you will do what I’m going to ask you.

493
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,294
But I’m going to ask you anyway.

494
00:36:37,134 --> 00:36:39,099
Please don’t leave him like I did.

495
00:36:41,219 --> 00:36:42,300
Auntie.

496
00:36:43,862 --> 00:36:45,604
You are my substitute.

497
00:36:48,259 --> 00:36:52,219
Can you help me to watch him from afar?

498
00:36:53,118 --> 00:36:54,659
Can I talk to you for a minute?

499
00:36:55,075 --> 00:36:58,902
I want to know the progress of the application for finding missing persons.

500
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,780
Okay.

501
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:05,917
Let’s meet and talk about the new updates on Monday.

502
00:37:05,967 --> 00:37:07,300
Thank you.

503
00:37:09,934 --> 00:37:11,804
Don’t you think about going back to him?

504
00:37:12,456 --> 00:37:13,909
He’s all grown up.

505
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,109
I think…

506
00:37:15,428 --> 00:37:18,460
he can take good care of you.

507
00:37:22,019 --> 00:37:23,259
If I go back,

508
00:37:24,548 --> 00:37:26,702
things will be harder for him.

509
00:37:28,568 --> 00:37:31,617
You don’t need to give me the answer right away, Mirin.

510
00:37:34,386 --> 00:37:36,108
You can go home and sleep on it.

511
00:37:38,269 --> 00:37:39,401
Don’t worry.

512
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:42,705
No one knows about this.

513
00:37:45,779 --> 00:37:47,509
Only you and your mother know

514
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,580
that I am here.

515
00:38:05,882 --> 00:38:08,315
Mirin never used the name Neeraaumpun.

516
00:38:09,059 --> 00:38:10,779
whether as a first name or a nickname.

517
00:38:11,114 --> 00:38:14,179
She had applied for a job at Next Innovation several times.

518
00:38:14,402 --> 00:38:15,816
She applied as Mirin.

519
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,607
She’d never been called in for an interview.

520
00:38:20,251 --> 00:38:22,106
Until she applied as Neeraaumpan.

521
00:38:22,294 --> 00:38:23,108
That’s right.

522
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:27,804
I found something interesting.

523
00:38:34,343 --> 00:38:36,259
She goes to this church every Sunday

524
00:38:36,822 --> 00:38:38,401
though she is not a Christian.

525
00:38:39,585 --> 00:38:40,500
Every Sunday.

526
00:38:40,844 --> 00:38:41,903
Never miss it.

527
00:38:43,579 --> 00:38:44,505
Why?

528
00:38:53,757 --> 00:38:55,005
Neeraaumpan?

529
00:38:55,955 --> 00:38:58,118
Do they know each other?

530
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:00,514
I’m not sure.

531
00:39:00,537 --> 00:39:03,272
I tried to go closer to them to eavesdrop on their conversation.

532
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:04,819
But someone interrupted me.

533
00:39:08,087 --> 00:39:10,365
Go find more information about this as soon as possible.

534
00:39:10,386 --> 00:39:12,014
Put your other work on hold.

535
00:39:12,445 --> 00:39:15,405
I want to know where Neeraaumpan is hiding

536
00:39:16,863 --> 00:39:18,808
and why she goes to meet his secretary.

537
00:39:20,051 --> 00:39:20,908
Yes.

538
00:39:22,237 --> 00:39:23,711
Don’t tell anyone about this

539
00:39:23,742 --> 00:39:25,801
or let anyone see these photos.

540
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,305
I’ll use it when Veekit makes a mistake

541
00:39:30,745 --> 00:39:32,897
on the day that he should not make any mistakes.

542
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:51,610
Directed by Ekkasit Trakulkasemsuk and Pantip Vibultham

543
00:40:11,925 --> 00:40:12,973
Sroy, do you think…

544
00:40:12,979 --> 00:40:14,340
I told you.

545
00:40:14,757 --> 00:40:16,340
When we are alone,

546
00:40:16,942 --> 00:40:19,023
you need to call me Mrs. Sroyphet.

547
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,616
I’m sorry.

548
00:40:23,798 --> 00:40:25,800
Though you are marrying my little brother,

549
00:40:26,397 --> 00:40:28,619
you will not become my family.

550
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,303
Don’t even dream of it.

551
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,139
I hate seeing something is out of place.

552
00:40:42,014 --> 00:40:45,800
I hate seeing a cheap sandwich served on a fine china plate.

553
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:49,205
Just look at the color and smell of the sandwich,

554
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:51,330
I can tell it’s a cheap one.

555
00:40:52,915 --> 00:40:54,103
Mrs. Sroyphet.

556
00:40:55,121 --> 00:40:57,940
I don’t understand how my family accepts you into our family.

557
00:40:58,847 --> 00:40:59,906
But for me,

558
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:06,340
I will never accept you.

559
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:25,783
I started to like my life right now.

560
00:41:25,896 --> 00:41:27,408
If you have any worries,

561
00:41:27,582 --> 00:41:28,808
I’m ready to listen to you.

562
00:41:29,205 --> 00:41:30,357
I’m not being stubborn.

563
00:41:31,611 --> 00:41:32,814
I’m sorry.

564
00:41:34,069 --> 00:41:36,576
Let’s spend time here as if it’s our last day.

565
00:41:37,091 --> 00:41:38,505
Should we act like a couple?

566
00:41:39,884 --> 00:41:40,705
Mirin.

567
00:41:41,176 --> 00:41:41,908
Mirin.

568
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,208
I’ll go looking for Mirin.

569
00:41:43,391 --> 00:41:44,219
I’ll go with you.

570
00:41:44,253 --> 00:41:45,420
Mirin.

571
00:41:46,078 --> 00:41:49,020
Are you sure you are not the reason why she left?

572
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:51,709
I can’t let you leave, Mirin.
