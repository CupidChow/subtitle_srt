1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,930
What should we do?

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:04,680
You don’t need to be that worried about me.

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:05,530
I’m sorry.

4
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:08,110
I’m just afraid it will make me feel good.

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,810
Hurry and go down.

6
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,240
I want to drink hot chocolate.

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,390
I started to want to steal your secretary, Veekit.

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,030
Mrs. Sroyphet.

9
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,420
I found something interesting.

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,860
Neeraaumpan?

11
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,870
I’ll use it when Veekit makes a mistake

12
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,820
on the day that he should not make any mistakes.

13
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:33,560
Hey.

14
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,850
I’d like all the details by tomorrow.

15
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,370
The data’s not that much. I think you can make it.

16
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,770
Mr. Vee.

17
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,580
Yes?

18
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:48,100
You have a meeting with your programmers in 30 minutes.

19
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,150
Alright.

20
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,720
Maewkwak.

21
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,760
Yes, Mr. Veekit?

22
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:59,790
Will your super busy team leader be in the meeting with me today?

23
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,310
He’s always so busy, isn’t he?

24
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:02,700
Oh, him.

25
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,000
He’ll be here.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,180
Don’t worry, sir.

27
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:24,430
I’m kind of starting to like my life right now.

28
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,020
Do your best, you guys.

29
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:03,160
Jirawat Sutivanichsak

30
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:08,740
Supassara Thanachart

31
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:13,530
Ishikawa Plowden

32
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:18,810
Phatchatorn Thanawat/Wanwimol Jaenasavamethee

33
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:24,730
Phanuroj Chalermkijporntavee/Chayakorn Jutamas

34
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:55,709
Directed by Ekkasit Trakulkasemsuk and Pantip Vibultham

35
00:02:55,734 --> 00:03:00,320
WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU HIDING?

36
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,350
Mirin.

37
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,350
Holy mother of God!

38
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,480
What was that?

39
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,250
Mother of who?

40
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,810
Mr. Chanon.

41
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,630
I’m working on a hot stove here.

42
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,270
What would happen if I’d spilled this?

43
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,720
Sorry.

44
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,180
You looked like you were worrying about something,

45
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,180
so I wanted to mess with you.

46
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,590
Didn’t think you’d bring up God’s mother like that.

47
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,300
Mr. Chanon.

48
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,160
But…

49
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,000
I got your mind off of it, didn’t I?

50
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,400
I might stop thinking for a little bit.

51
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:46,340
But only because I’m embarrassed you’re making fun of my exclamation.

52
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,860
I’m sorry.

53
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,920
I’m sorry.

54
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,860
Mirin.

55
00:03:58,825 --> 00:04:02,739
I’d better hurry up with this

56
00:04:02,764 --> 00:04:05,394
or I’ll never hear the end of it from Mr. Vee again.

57
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,190
Okay.

58
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,260
Mirin.

59
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,100
Yes?

60
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,770
If something’s weighing on your mind,

61
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,330
whatever it is,

62
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,330
I’m here if you need to talk.

63
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,260
Thank you.

64
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,460
So…

65
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,160
There’s absolutely no progress.

66
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,100
It’s already tough getting access to people's databases.

67
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:24,840
So looking specifically for missing people will take even more time.

68
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,210
But I’ve been hiring you to do this all this time,

69
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,580
and for how much longer?

70
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:37,260
Or should I… hire someone else who does a better job?

71
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,990
I’ll try my best to work as fast as possible.

72
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,750
Oh, yeah, Mr. Veekit.

73
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,010
Yeah?

74
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:53,166
There’s one more thing to consider about

75
00:05:53,191 --> 00:05:55,480
developing a missing person tracking app.

76
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,070
Which is?

77
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:02,148
Could it be possible that some people

78
00:06:02,173 --> 00:06:06,084
who go missing might not want to be found?

79
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:13,410
Maybe they disappear for their own safety?

80
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:19,250
At least their family members deserve to know where they are.

81
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:25,060
What if the family member is the husband who’s been abusing his wife?

82
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,998
What if their own family members are

83
00:06:27,023 --> 00:06:29,164
the very reason they decide to disappear?

84
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,480
I believe Mr. Veekit has already thought that through.

85
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,890
It’s just under functions and specifications.

86
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:45,850
Shall we discuss that detail later?

87
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,520
Sorting that kind of detail out beforehand might not be a bad idea.

88
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,850
We don’t want to be stalling, do we?

89
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,970
It can be a waste of time, you see.

90
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,970
Excuse me.

91
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:09,850
What Maewkwak said makes sense.

92
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:13,480
For someone who’s looking, this app is useful.

93
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,030
But for someone who’s trying to lay low,

94
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,820
for whatever reasons,

95
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,370
they might feel violated by it.

96
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,100
Do you think my mother left me

97
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,540
because she wanted to be rid of me,

98
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,530
or because she needed help?

99
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:33,350
Watch it, Vee.

100
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,350
Mirin is right here.

101
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:37,350
Mirin knows everything.

102
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:40,210
She knows what’s wrong with me.

103
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,230
Now answer me.

104
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,030
Why do you think my mother left?

105
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,030
Don’t raise your voice at me, Veekit.

106
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,444
You’re only sitting at the head

107
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:50,230
of the table because I showed you the ropes.

108
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:53,510
If you keep mixing your personal matter into business,

109
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:56,680
Next Innovation will be over soon.

110
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,930
Mr. Vee.

111
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,810
I’m not being a spoiled brat.

112
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,450
How could I be?

113
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,800
It’s not like I had a mother to spoil me.

114
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,198
The only way for you to understand is if

115
00:08:24,223 --> 00:08:25,870
your mother had gone missing like mine.

116
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:29,720
And I’d help you any way I can.

117
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,820
I wouldn’t let you just miss her like crazy or worry like mad like this.

118
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:37,520
You have both your mother and your grandmother.

119
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,640
You would never understand me.

120
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:56,610
I’m sorry.

121
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,000
I’m sorry for yelling at you.

122
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:14,040
Stop crying.

123
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,330
I told you I don’t like it when your cheeks are cold.

124
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,520
You crybaby.

125
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:27,270
Please go back to your office, Mr. Vee.

126
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:30,030
I’ll be there in a minute.

127
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,030
Come with me.

128
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,330
Does he think the world revolves around him?

129
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,490
Come on.

130
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,090
He’s your boss, you know?

131
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,570
So what?

132
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:02,410
So you’re on his payroll?

133
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,710
What?

134
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,710
Buy it yourself.

135
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,710
Just be nice and share.

136
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,390
Fine.

137
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:22,750
You feel better now?

138
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,520
What?

139
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,500
Hey.

140
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,010
Wait here for a minute.

141
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:00,390
I don’t know what’s going on in that head of yours.

142
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:03,010
But as your boss,

143
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,230
I’m ordering you to forget all about it for now.

144
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,720
Alright.

145
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,160
Let’s try to spend our day here as if it’s our last.

146
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,830
What face are you making?

147
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:00,430
I’m putting on my ready-to-go face.

148
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:04,130
Let’s have fun like today is our last.

149
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,470
I’m smiling at you, too.

150
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,450
Good.

151
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:10,440
That’s great.

152
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,780
Well, then…

153
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,690
Let’s go.

154
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,480
Hold on. Hold on, Mr. Vee.

155
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,580
Are–Are you—

156
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,560
You’re alright now.

157
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,960
Let’s go sit over there for a bit.

158
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:02,810
Yeah.

159
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,140
Vee, let’s go!

160
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,250
Let’s run from here.

161
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,470
What’s so scary?

162
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,320
What does this ghost look like?

163
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,120
Well, she just looks scary like a ghost.

164
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,910
I see.

165
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,570
What is she feeling?

166
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:17,310
Mr. Vee?

167
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,850
Is that something you really need to know?

168
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:21,260
Is it all that vital for your wellbeing to know?

169
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,320
Just calm down and explain to me.

170
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,940
I’ve always wanted to know why people are so scared of ghosts.

171
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:27,660
Just look at her.

172
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,400
She’s filthy.

173
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,390
Why are all ghosts so dirty?

174
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:35,910
You guys need to put on something decent before you die, you know that?

175
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:38,380
Mr. Vee…

176
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:43,090
This is why funeral homes deserve all the respect for making sure corpses look nice.

177
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:43,880
Don’t you agree?

178
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,520
Mr. Vee, please.

179
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:51,360
So… what is she feeling?

180
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:56,770
She’s… She’s feeling vengeful.

181
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,030
Just all in all scary and evil.

182
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,230
She seems feral. Don’t go any closer.

183
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:01,940
Mr. Vee?

184
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,399
Do you have to take a shower and

185
00:15:04,424 --> 00:15:06,820
get all dressed up again for another shift?

186
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:07,740
Uhh—

187
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,560
Enough.

188
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,580
Enough already.

189
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:15,620
Now I’m curious, if I encounter actual ghosts,

190
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,620
would I be able to see their faces?

191
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:20,020
Let’s just go.

192
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,180
She’s getting really annoyed.

193
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,790
Let’s just get out of here.

194
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:26,700
Wasn’t that nice?

195
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,580
I’d always wanted to know what ghosts look like.

196
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:34,980
Nice for you, maybe.

197
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,280
I was so close to blacking out.

198
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,580
You kept asking questions about her face, too.

199
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,820
Why didn’t you just ask me to read her physiognomy right then and there?

200
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,820
You’re so dramatic.

201
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:48,570
It was hardly that scary.

202
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,960
Only because you couldn’t see her face.

203
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,170
You’re bullying me, Mirin.

204
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,830
I’m sorry.

205
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,730
I’m kidding.

206
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,950
I’m smiling at you right now.

207
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:30,560
This past week has put a real strain on my cheeks.

208
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,790
I’ve been trying to find out why.

209
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:38,300
Now I get it. It’s because I’ve been smiling more than usual.

210
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,290
I smile more because of you.

211
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,590
I get along with people better because of you.

212
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:51,510
You make me feel like one of those people who…

213
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,990
becomes a better person just because they have a girlfriend.

214
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,990
Should we…

215
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,990
Should we start dating?

216
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,210
Oh, Mirin?

217
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,370
Mirin?

218
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,610
Mirin.

219
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,650
Mirin!

220
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,220
Mirin.

221
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,250
Mirin!

222
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,690
Mirin!

223
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:27,890
Mirin!

224
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,010
Mi—

225
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,330
Mirin!

226
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,360
Mirin.

227
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,010
Mirin!

228
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,090
Mirin!

229
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:51,790
Mirin!

230
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:54,590
Mr. Vee, I’m over here.

231
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,830
Mirin?

232
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,070
Mirin.

233
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,550
Don’t just disappear like that again.

234
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:15,410
This past week has put a real strain on my cheeks.

235
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,110
It’s because I’ve been smiling more than usual.

236
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,350
Ow!

237
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,590
Mirin?

238
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,440
Mirin!

239
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,590
Mirin!

240
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:37,050
Mirin!

241
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:40,180
Mr. Vee, I’m over here.

242
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,950
Don’t just disappear like that again.

243
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,065
You—

244
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:56,014
You were so close to getting promoted just now, you know that, you dork?

245
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:52,710
You were awfully quiet in the car.

246
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:55,760
In a strange way, no less.

247
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,430
What were you thinking?

248
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,800
I’m just tired.

249
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:05,350
I’ll let you come to work late tomorrow.

250
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,560
Alright.

251
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,850
Thank you.

252
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:16,520
Thank you for everything.

253
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,520
Thank you for every day.

254
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:22,650
Thank you, especially, for today.

255
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:27,080
I’m really happy right now.

256
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,230
I am so happy my smile nearly splits my face.

257
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,160
Splits your face, huh?

258
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,690
I like that.

259
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:39,560
Go on in and take a rest.

260
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,560
Yes.

261
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,940
You too.

262
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,940
Take a lot of rest.

263
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,330
Don’t forget to eat three square meals.

264
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,330
Drive safe, alright?

265
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,430
Come on.

266
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:56,710
As long as it’s not people’s faces, I can see the rest pretty clearly.

267
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:58,710
Don’t worry about me.

268
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,320
Go take a rest.

269
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,980
I’ll see you tomorrow.

270
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:06,920
Goodbye.

271
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,380
When I said you could come in late,

272
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,510
I didn’t mean to take the whole morning off, Mirin.

273
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:59,530
Mirin!

274
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:20,120
[Hot Chocolate Recipe]

275
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Pick up. Pick up, Mirin.

276
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,790
What's up?

277
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,310
Is Mirin with you?

278
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,390
No.

279
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:47,720
Why? What’s wrong?

280
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,720
Do you know where she is?

281
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,280
She’s your secretary.

282
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,950
How’d I know?

283
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,930
Vee.

284
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:00,090
What’s wrong?

285
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:02,250
I can’t find her.

286
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,550
She doesn’t answer the phone. I can’t get through to her.

287
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,770
Hold on.

288
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:09,880
You’re making a fuss because she doesn’t pick up a few calls?

289
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,966
I told her she could come in late to work,

290
00:23:11,991 --> 00:23:14,394
but she still hasn’t shown up.

291
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:17,020
It’s barely noon.

292
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:17,930
Just calm down

293
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:21,120
She left the hot chocolate recipe in the kitchen.

294
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,640
Hot chocolate recipe?

295
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,090
And?

296
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:27,250
It’s like she knew she would go.

297
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,750
She loves that recipe.

298
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,990
But she just left it on the wall in the kitchen.

299
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,240
Hey, hold on— Vee!

300
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,320
What?

301
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:49,610
Neeraaumpan handed in her resignation letter two days ago.

302
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,000
Resignation?

303
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,710
Yes. She said she was going back to take care of her family business.

304
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:56,546
I did tell her the letter still needs

305
00:23:56,571 --> 00:23:59,524
your signature of approval, though.

306
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,500
No one picks up.

307
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,050
I’ve tried again and again.

308
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:21,680
Her family said she left the house this morning.

309
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,160
I’m going to go look for her.

310
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:24,910
I’m coming with you.

311
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:26,910
It might be faster with two people.

312
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:27,720
Good.

313
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,600
You go to her house.

314
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,950
I’ll check out all the places we used to go to.

315
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:34,880
I’ll leave the office with you in case

316
00:24:34,905 --> 00:24:36,990
anyone needs anything from us, Aew-eas.

317
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:38,990
Yes, of course.

318
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:46,050
Vee.

319
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:49,190
Before you go look for her,

320
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:53,320
are you sure you’re not the reason she disappeared?

321
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,430
Gosh, can you not pick fights right now and focus on looking for her?

322
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:58,030
I’ll ask you the same question I did yesterday.

323
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:01,620
What if she doesn’t want to be found?

324
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,223
I’m not answering some petty questions

325
00:25:05,248 --> 00:25:07,604
you came up with just to win against me.

326
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,390
Vee, that’s not—

327
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,830
Mirin!

328
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:22,670
Mirin!

329
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:37,960
Mirin!

330
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:41,220
Mirin!

331
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:48,310
Hello?

332
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:56,010
How can I help?

333
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:57,440
Hello.

334
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,710
I’m here to see Mirin.

335
00:25:58,710 --> 00:25:59,860
Is she home?

336
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:04,120
She said she was going to work early in the morning.

337
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,250
She usually comes home late in the evening.

338
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,670
Did she cause trouble at the office?

339
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:11,010
Oh, of course not.

340
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:13,910
She didn’t say anything else?

341
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:15,650
No, she didn’t.

342
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:18,620
Is something the matter?

343
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:21,630
Mirin quit her job.

344
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:24,780
We’ve been trying to contact her, but we can’t reach her at all.

345
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,740
What?

346
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,040
She quit?

347
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,780
Yes.

348
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,380
Mom. Mom.

349
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,830
Mom.

350
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,450
Why don’t you get back inside and I’ll talk to him?

351
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:33,360
What’s going on, Su?

352
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,360
Just get in and I’ll tell you later.

353
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,660
Hello.

354
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,870
Rin handed in her resignation letter?

355
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:41,890
She did.

356
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:44,230
That’s why I came here.

357
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,550
Mirin is smart.

358
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:49,180
She’s an amazing secretary.

359
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,530
We don’t want to lose her.

360
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,800
Well, I…

361
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:00,280
I respect her decision.

362
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:06,030
But I’ll let her know when she’s home that…

363
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:06,880
Chanon.

364
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,120
That you came by, Mr. Chanon.

365
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,240
I’ll have to ask you to leave for now.

366
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,240
I have something to talk about with my mother.

367
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:17,590
Yes.

368
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,080
Thank you.

369
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,120
[Mirin]

370
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,260
The number you have dialed is not available at the moment.

371
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:51,280
Please leave a message after the tone.

372
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,720
Mirin, you dummy!

373
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,350
Where are you? Call me back right now.

374
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:57,350
I won’t let you quit.

375
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:11,100
I won’t let you disappear too.

376
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,100
Oh?

377
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,210
I don’t believe we have an appointment today.

378
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:45,490
I’m sorry for showing up unannounced.

379
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,490
I’m here looking for Mirin.

380
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:50,080
Do you know where she might be, Big Noi?

381
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,350
She resigned and just vanished without a trace.

382
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,670
Hey.

383
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:56,600
I would never just steal your employee away like that.

384
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,330
That’s not what I meant.

385
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:04,070
I just want to know if you have some ideas as to what’s on her mind.

386
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:17,930
I don’t know what’s going on in that girl’s head.

387
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,530
Try thinking it through.

388
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:23,020
Every little detail.

389
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:27,510
Where could someone like Mirin possibly be right now?

390
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:35,090
Do you have a place you go to to take a breather?

391
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,620
Actually, I do.

392
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:43,360
Yes.

393
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,490
Good.

394
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:46,690
If you get it now, go to her.

395
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:48,100
Good luck.

396
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:48,710
Go.

397
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,310
Thank you.

398
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:01,790
I came up here to find a quiet place to calm myself down.

399
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:06,000
But this is where I come to take a breather.

400
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,780
Mirin!

401
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,990
Don’t you dare run away from me, you dork!

402
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:20,740
Do you have any idea how long I’ve been looking for you?

403
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,310
Do you have a place you go to to take a breather?

404
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:31,310
Actually, I do.

405
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:34,710
The Green Bridge on my way home.

406
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:37,660
If I was awfully tired after school,

407
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:40,150
I’d take a little stroll there before going home.

408
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:41,820
That’s not true.

409
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,520
I was there all the time.

410
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,260
I never saw you.

411
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:49,220
Only because you couldn’t see anyone’s faces, more like.

412
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,820
Careful.

413
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:54,290
You’re bullying me again, you secretary.

414
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,480
Let’s just say…

415
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:06,590
If you disappear one day,

416
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,150
that’s where I’ll look.

417
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,320
You dummy!

418
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,950
What the hell did you do that for?

419
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:22,140
I can sue you, you know?

420
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:25,400
You can’t just up and quit without any notice.

421
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,610
That could very well kill me, you know that?

422
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:29,500
And what’s happened to your phone?

423
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,840
Did the accept call button break down?

424
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:34,570
You’re causing trouble for everybody!

425
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:35,843
I was so close

426
00:32:35,868 --> 00:32:39,924
to reporting a missing person at the police station, you know.

427
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,020
Mr. Vee…

428
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:45,370
You know what I went through.

429
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:48,050
How dare you do this to me?

430
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:50,880
Is your heart stone cold?

431
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,730
Mr. Vee.

432
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:59,060
How could I ever smile without you?

433
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:06,230
I’m sorry.

434
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,900
I’m sorry.

435
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,290
I’m so sorry, Mr. Vee.

436
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,440
[Chanon]

437
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,020
Where are you?

438
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,610
What’s up?

439
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:58,160
Something important came up.

440
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,500
Can it wait?

441
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,600
I’m exhausted.

442
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,370
I doubt it can since it was your mother who wanted to meet.

443
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:05,660
I’ll see you at your house.

444
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:31,880
Oh, Non.

445
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,880
Come sit down. Come.

446
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:35,970
Mom.

447
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:37,850
Tanya.

448
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:40,550
What’s going on?

449
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:49,000
Your mother called me here because she’s got some really good news.

450
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:53,850
Here, Non.

451
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:55,060
Look at these.

452
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,830
Take a look.

453
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:58,860
You see?

454
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:00,350
Here, too.

455
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,700
It’s Mirin.

456
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:10,490
Mirin, the woman who applied for a job with the name Neeraaumpan.

457
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:14,630
Do you see who’s sitting right next to her?

458
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:20,910
She looks familiar, but I don’t know.'

459
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:26,400
This woman is Neeraaumpan.

460
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:37,780
Neeraaumpan, Veekit’s mother who has been missing.

461
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:45,870
You don’t know anything about this?

462
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:04,120
What’s your problem?

463
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,930
Just tell me.

464
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:11,720
You think someone with my IQ level wouldn’t get it?

465
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:15,710
You think you can just up and leave your job like that?

466
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,577
Don’t you even dare believe

467
00:36:17,602 --> 00:36:21,330
leaving your hot chocolate recipe will help you.

468
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:23,470
Why did you go?

469
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:25,020
Tell me.

470
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,020
I feel ashamed

471
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,170
…for lying to you.

472
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:37,010
She lied about her name,

473
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:39,930
knowing full well what the name means to Veekit.

474
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:42,630
She’s also been keeping a secret about Neeraaumpan.

475
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:46,280
Do you really think you should trust someone like her?

476
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,060
I knew about the name change.

477
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:51,833
But I let her have a go anyway

478
00:36:51,858 --> 00:36:55,220
because I was sick of looking for another secretary.

479
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:58,870
I just thought the name might get Veekit’s attention,

480
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:00,610
and it really did.

481
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:07,060
How can you be sure Mirin and Veekit didn’t know each other before this?

482
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,240
What do you mean?

483
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,380
This might be a setup.

484
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:15,230
Worse still, Mirin might be someone Neeraaumpan sent

485
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:17,720
as a part of her plan to take over Next.

486
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,410
You’re taking it too far, Mom.

487
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:21,700
Mirin isn’t like that.

488
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,550
Have you ever told her about Veekit’s mother?

489
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:34,750
She didn’t say anything?

490
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:40,160
If so, that means she’s really been lying to you.

491
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,410
She’s obviously been doing a good job at stringing you both along.

492
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:46,770
She knows Big Noi and that hot chocolate recipe.

493
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:48,260
Honestly?

494
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:52,700
At this point, she just seems like a professional con artist.

495
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:01,820
I think she’s hiding something from us.

496
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:05,780
What we don’t know for sure is who she’s working for.

497
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:09,250
Lying?

498
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:11,050
Lying about what?

499
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:12,720
Why?

500
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,810
You’re irritating me to no end.

501
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,980
What face are you making?

502
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,150
What are you feeling?

503
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:20,740
What are you thinking?

504
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:23,230
I can’t freaking tell at all.

505
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:26,120
I’m feeling ashamed.

506
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:29,330
I’m looking at you with guilt in my eyes.

507
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:33,780
Because there is something I really did you wrong.

508
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,780
Well, then just tell me.

509
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:38,210
What did you do? How was it wrong?

510
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:40,210
Just tell me already.

511
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,320
Mr. Vee.

512
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,300
Actually, I…

513
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:59,630
Directed by Ekkasit Trakulkasemsuk and Pantip Vibultham

514
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:10,630
Chanon.

515
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:11,910
Yes?

516
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:13,550
Come here, baby.

517
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:19,770
Chanon, did you share your toys with your cousin again?

518
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:20,520
I did.

519
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:24,670
He likes the robot Grandpa bought me last year.

520
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:27,520
So I let him play with it.

521
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:30,600
Listen to me, dear.

522
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,700
You don’t have to share your toys with him.

523
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:37,640
You don’t have to share anything with him.

524
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,370
He will do better without it.

525
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:42,651
Your grandfather and the maids

526
00:39:42,676 --> 00:39:46,050
have all been spoiling him rotten already.

527
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:49,540
But I enjoy playing with him.

528
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,180
Alright.

529
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,530
I’ll let you play with him for now.

530
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:57,630
But you have to come back to me when it’s time, alright?

531
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:59,440
Yes. I promise.

532
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,000
Okay.

533
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,880
Go on.

534
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:14,140
I’ve been thinking…

535
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,010
It might already be too late.

536
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:19,220
Let’s do our worst together.

537
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,860
Let’s mess things up together.

538
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:25,560
We have to get her out of the picture as soon as possible.

539
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:29,140
What kind of slutty act did you pull to work your charms so well?

540
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:29,760
Tanya.

541
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,680
What, Mirin?

542
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:34,000
I’ll wait until the right time.

543
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I know the truth now.
