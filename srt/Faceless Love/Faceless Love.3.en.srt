1
00:00:00,492 --> 00:00:04,890
You need to be next to me and tell me who is walking towards me.

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:07,000
I admire you, Veekit.

3
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,060
Where have you been?

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,600
You said you would be next to me all the time.

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,170
What happened makes me see your inadequacy

6
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:20,920
when working with an important partner of your company.

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,920
All you can do is memorize what you are told?

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,740
There is no tomorrow for her.

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,020
Neeraaumpan, what the hell are you doing?

10
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:30,110
Mirin!

11
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,810
Who did you call Mirin?

12
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,320
Do you want this?

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,150
It’ll cheer you up.

14
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,230
Mirin.

15
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:11,820
No, baby, what are you doing bothering this lady?

16
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:16,950
Oh, I’m terribly sorry.

17
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,100
Are you alright, miss?

18
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,650
Miss?

19
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:24,030
Are you alright?

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,830
Did you come here with someone?

21
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,300
Do you remember anything?

22
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:53,290
Jirawat Sutivanichsak

23
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:58,480

EVERYBODY HIDES THEIR OWN SECRETS.

29
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:11,960
Mirin?

30
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,880
Why did Non call you Mirin?

31
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,300
It’s my nickname.

32
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,020
Mirin is my nickname.

33
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,450
Mirin?

34
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,530
That doesn’t make any sense.

35
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,690
Sorry?

36
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,370
Shouldn’t it be something like Nee?

37
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,010
Or Aumpan?

38
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,860
Your full name is Neeraaumpan, isn’t it?

39
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,620
Why Mirin?

40
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,620
Strange.

41
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,070
Sure, I guess.

42
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,250
Even your nickname is a mistake.

43
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,660
What exactly are you going to do with Mirin?

44
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,070
Why’d you ask?

45
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:03,190
If you’re going to fire her, I’ll hire her.

46
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:09,770
And after that, you find your own secretary.

47
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,180
I’m not looking for one for you again.

48
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,950
What?

49
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,260
What are you so mad at me about?

50
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:20,870
Is it because I’m going to fire… Mirin?

51
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:22,570
You’re acting like we’re not even cousins.

52
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,570
Don’t you dare use that ruse.

53
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,680
I won’t let you take my secretary.

54
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,660
I’m the only one who gets to say if she stays or leaves.

55
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,340
Stop being such a spoiled brat.

56
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,960
The world doesn’t revolve around you.

57
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,390
The world that is Next Innovation does.

58
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,380
Veekit.

59
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,610
Excuse me!

60
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,210
Excuse me, both of you.

61
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,270
I think…

62
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,890
Why don't you two work it out between yourselves first?

63
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,250
I…

64
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:04,500
I’d feel much better if you’re fighting over my skills,

65
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,810
not arguing just to win over the other like this.

66
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:16,100
So I must ask that you both reconsider this.

67
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:21,720
If my mistake was unforgivable,

68
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,360
I’ll understand if you let me go.

69
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,520
If I’m not all that crucial to you,

70
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:34,000
you don’t have to help me.

71
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:46,770
How long are you planning to act like a problem child?

72
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,870
Mirin.

73
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,780
I’ll give you a ride.

74
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:56,000
It’s alright.

75
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,120
Please just sort this out.

76
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,850
It’s difficult to find a ride at this hour.

77
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,140
Come on.

78
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,740
Think of it as an apology for earlier.

79
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,960
But I truly wasn’t offended.

80
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,690
Mirin.

81
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:11,310
It’s late.

82
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,670
And look at what you’re wearing.

83
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,360
Come on. Get in the car.

84
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,180
Alright.

85
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,850
Thank you.

86
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,340
Let’s go.

87
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,910
It’s right over there.

88
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,450
Thank you.

89
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,290
Uh, I’m sorry.

90
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:04,540
Veekit and I didn’t mean to make you feel uncomfortable.

91
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:09,350
I dragged you into this because fighting over you might…

92
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:14,280
have less impact than what he and I actually want to fight about.

93
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,410
Do you guys fight a lot?

94
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:22,840
Is it always serious?

95
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,960
We’re two guys equally full of egos.

96
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,960
I’m older.

97
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,010
I’m taking care of the most important department of this company.

98
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:42,000
But the boss just happens to be my younger cousin who thinks he’s the Sun.

99
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:45,340
Well, we’re just idiots.

100
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:52,350
You know, I feel like Mr. Veekit actually revolves around you.

101
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,720
He asks for you first thing in the morning,

102
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,720
then again at lunch,

103
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,940
even calls for you before he goes home.

104
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,750
Whatever decision he’s making,

105
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,330
he waits for you to approve.

106
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,800
For real?

107
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,610
Yeah.

108
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,970
You should go home and take a rest, Mr. Chanon.

109
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:22,860
If Mr. Veekit really is going to fire me,

110
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,870
you don’t have to worry about me.

111
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,960
I’ll just go on taking care of myself.

112
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:34,830
I’ve already learned a lot from what you’ve been teaching me.

113
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:40,330
Veekit isn’t stupid.

114
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:47,400
Once that pole-head comes to his senses, he’ll see.

115
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,480
He needs you.

116
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:56,920
Your greatest strength is the fact that you are so likeable.

117
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,410
You’re amazing.

118
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,560
Thank you again.

119
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:35,060
What are you so mad at me about?

120
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:39,370
Is it because I’m going to fire… Mirin?

121
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:43,410
He just doesn’t want his big brother to hate him, huh?

122
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,070
What are you doing here?

123
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,070
Just go home and rest.

124
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,530
But it bothers me.

125
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,870
Are you really mad at me because of Mirin?

126
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:14,580
You came all the way to my house just to ask me this?

127
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,580
Yeah.

128
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:20,490
What she said at the party could ruin us.

129
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:23,640
Methawee might not want to invest with us,

130
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,390
or it could turn the whole deal unfair for us.

131
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:29,420
Mirin really made a mistake this time.

132
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,070
You made bigger mistakes in the past.

133
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:38,090
Had I not slapped you into shape and only threatened to fire you,

134
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:40,740
you'd have been nowhere.

135
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,990
How does that even compare?

136
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,980
I’m the owner of the company.

137
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,400
She’s just a regular employee.

138
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,140
So what if you own the company?

139
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,830
I’m just an employee, too, aren’t I?

140
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,740
If I make a silly blunder one day, are you going to fire me, too?

141
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,160
What?

142
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,580
We’re talking about a new employee named Mirin.

143
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,740
Not you.

144
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,600
At least she’s the new employee who can make you the damn hot chocolate

145
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,430
that sates the crave your mother left.

146
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,210
Hey!

147
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:08,090
What does my mother have to do with this?

148
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:15,110
Why did you bring up my mother!

149
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,110
What is all this ruckus?

150
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:24,070
What need do you have to be yelling at my son at this hour?

151
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:26,250
It’s very late, Veekit.

152
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,980
Will you just please let my son rest?

153
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,420
You go to bed, Mom.

154
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,750
Vee is already leaving.

155
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,210
I’m sorry.

156
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,910
I only need five more minutes.

157
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:44,250
Since you can’t see my face,

158
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,270
I guess you can’t fathom just how serious I am.

159
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:50,610
But I am currently incredibly unhappy with you.

160
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:53,840
You think you’re so important that everyone has to pause and listen to you

161
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,470
even when it’s very late.

162
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:02,950
I believe manners are something basic enough that you should know,

163
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,730
even without a mother to teach you.

164
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,160
Mom.

165
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,920
Vee, we will talk tomorrow.

166
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,900
Go to bed, Mom.

167
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,140
It’s late.

168
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,040
Yes?

169
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,040
I thought you went to bed.

170
00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:01,320
I heard Veekit’s new secretary messed up at the party.

171
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,520
She did.

172
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,740
And this is someone you found for him?

173
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,470
Yes.

174
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:11,060
But… she didn’t mean to.

175
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,640
She just doesn’t know what’s what yet.

176
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,240
She’s actually great.

177
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,650
You don’t have to train her anymore.

178
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:20,450
Just leave her be.

179
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:23,110
The more mistakes Veekit makes,

180
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:26,380
the more you stand out.

181
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:33,620
I told Tanya that if she really wants to invest,

182
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:36,800
she should wait until you have your own company.

183
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,550
Mom…

184
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,800
Listen.

185
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,520
Tanya’s family is very influential.

186
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,610
They have connections and money.

187
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:48,360
Don’t let them invest with Veekit.

188
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,740
You have to talk your friend into investing with us.

189
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,160
Understood?

190
00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:03,330
I think you’ll finally get a chance to do your own thing soon.

191
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:05,620
Good job, baby.

192
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,320
Go to sleep. It’s late.

193
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,120
Oh, right…

194
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,920
If you think that secretary is promising,

195
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,920
just keep her for ourselves.

196
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,920
What do you mean?

197
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:28,180
If we have someone of our own stay close to Veekit,

198
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:32,180
we could learn something much more easily, isn’t that right?

199
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,470
Goodnight, baby.

200
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:03,020
You nemesis!

201
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:06,500
Veekit!

202
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,910
What?!

203
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,760
Oh, you’ve done it, Mirin!

204
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,730
What should I do?

205
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:17,820
What should I do? What should I do?

206
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:21,630
If I don’t do something, he’s totally firing me.

207
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,500
A cake as my sincerest apology.

208
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:44,410
Neeraaumpan.

209
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:47,700
Oh, Aew-eas. Hello.

210
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,910
Are you alright?

211
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,280
I heard about what happened last night.

212
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,400
It must have been difficult for you.

213
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,500
It was.

214
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:00,010
And he heard me calling him names at the top of my lungs like that, too.

215
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:03,050
That’s why I baked some cake for him as an apology.

216
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:04,700
Do you think it’ll work?

217
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,460
Veekit isn’t here yet, though.

218
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,510
Oh?

219
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,060
Isn’t he?

220
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:13,820
Maybe he’s late?

221
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,980
I don’t think so.

222
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,780
If he was coming, he would have been here by now.

223
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,990
My guess is… it’s his Skip Day.

224
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:22,830
His what day?

225
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:25,900
Everyone around here calls it his Skip Day.

226
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,050
It’s when he skips work to go nobody knows where.

227
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:30,270
And he doesn’t care if there’s a meeting or whatever.

228
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,820
He just goes.

229
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,980
You can’t contact him via text or call.

230
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,220
It’s like he’s disappeared from the face of the earth

231
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,220
and then comes back the next day like nothing happens.

232
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,040
“I’m back, guys!” or something like that.

233
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,540
Oh.

234
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:47,200
Well, I guess my cake is just going to waste, then.

235
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,590
Keep it. Maybe he’ll come.

236
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:53,300
So far, that never happened, though.

237
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,670
Bye.

238
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,030
Are you waiting for Veekit?

239
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,530
He probably won’t be here.

240
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:52,450
Last night was a bit rough for him.

241
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,190
And are you alright, Mr. Chanon?

242
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,730
Me?

243
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,170
I’m fine.

244
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:04,620
I came to work, didn’t I?

245
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:07,240
You’re right.

246
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,330
He’s the worst.

247
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,270
I haven’t had anything to eat all morning.

248
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:22,490
Wait a minute.

249
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,060
Here.

250
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,490
Please have your fill.

251
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:48,980
I’ll eat, too.

252
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,520
Thank you.

253
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,550
It’s really good.

254
00:18:56,550 --> 00:19:00,140
I’m sure the person who made this is both very talented and beautiful.

255
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,450
Try it, Mr. Chanon.

256
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:05,430
No other compliments but “It’s good!” allowed, though.

257
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,560
Alright, then.

258
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,170
It’s really good!

259
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:13,150
It is, isn’t it?

260
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:16,630
It’s amazing!

261
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:26,860
Even you don’t know where Mr. Veekit is?

262
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,150
You’re right.

263
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,870
I tried to look for him at first.

264
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:37,870
I went everywhere I thought he might be at.

265
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:40,010
Restaurants, bars,

266
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:42,410
theaters, hotels, rooftops.

267
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,380
Even riversides.

268
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,260
I went everywhere.

269
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,790
But I couldn’t figure it out to save my life where he could be.

270
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,120
Oh?

271
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,120
It must be that place.

272
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,630
I can think of somewhere.

273
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:04,250
But it’s just my hypothesis, though.

274
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,160
I’ll let you know as soon as it’s been proven.

275
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,890
I have to go.

276
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:13,970
Here. It’s all yours.

277
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,790
Goodbye!

278
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:19,910
Sure.

279
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:35,360
[Dear Mr. Veekit, enjoy the cake.]

280
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:48,290
What are you doing here, Mr. Non?

281
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,430
Nothing.

282
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,030
I was just passing by.

283
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,560
What do you need?

284
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,750
Isn’t that Neeraaumpan’s cake?

285
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,750
She said she was going to give it to Veekit.

286
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,910
Why are you…

287
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,910
It’s for you now.

288
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,000
Take it.

289
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,230
I’m alright.

290
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,510
I’ve got this.

291
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:09,510
Would you like some?

292
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,570
I’m alright.

293
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:18,790
He doesn’t like this?

294
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,160
But it’s so good.

295
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,590
Are you even here?

296
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,960
Mr. Vee.

297
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:23,570
Mr. Vee.

298
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:24,820
What?

299
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,260
You—

300
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,260
How do you know I’m here?

301
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,530
Did you…

302
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,570
Did you bug me?

303
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,950
Don’t be ridiculous, sir.

304
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,870
One more time, please.

305
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:47,180
I’ll pay you triple.

306
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,070
Go away.

307
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,440
It’s a private ride.

308
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,960
Go.

309
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,820
Isn’t it lonely playing alone?

310
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:56,660
What?

311
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:07,400
Listen.

312
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:13,540
There’s literally only a 0.001% chance that anybody knows I’m here.

313
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,540
How did you know?

314
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:23,810
I just guessed from what little 0.001% have to offer.

315
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:25,210
That’s impossible.

316
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:28,550
It is possible, and it’s already happened.

317
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:33,180
But if you need a reason that makes sense to you.

318
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,030
I’ll say…

319
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:38,100
I followed the trail of the Milky Way,

320
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,500
and saw that the entire universe revolves around something in this place.

321
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,360
So I thought it could be you.

322
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,890
Your theory is incorrect.

323
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:57,750
But I forgive you.

324
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,960
You won’t fire me?

325
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,960
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Vee.

326
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,050
I’ll do my best.

327
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,500
No more mistakes!

328
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,870
Stop it.

329
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:08,090
You’re loud, you dork.

330
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,120
Are you trying to deafen me?

331
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:36,710
Is this where you always are on your Skip Days?

332
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,830
Yeah.

333
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,480
Why here?

334
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,600
Nosy.

335
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,850
But I’m curious.

336
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:50,450
I’m your secretary.

337
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,190
It’s important that I know.

338
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:55,360
When did I say you’re my secretary?

339
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,740
What? Did you change your mind?

340
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,210
Just now you—

341
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:04,000
That was you assuming all by yourself that I wouldn’t fire you.

342
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:17,240
The last time I saw my mother

343
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,240
was from over there on the merry-go-round.

344
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,910
I asked her if I could go play,

345
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:33,610
asked her to wait for a minute.

346
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,700
It was only a few rides.

347
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,280
Took no time at all.

348
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,780
Still, she didn’t wait.

349
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:03,840
What would you do if you saw your mother again?

350
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:12,510
I’d put her on the merry-go-round.

351
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:15,660
Let her ride a few times.

352
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:18,270
This time, I’ll be the one who walks away.

353
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:30,690
Mr. Vee!

354
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:32,530
What? You startled me.

355
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:36,640
I will work really hard from now on.

356
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:41,860
No matter what you want or need, you can just tell me.

357
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:44,740
I’ll be by your side.

358
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:47,080
Whichever way you turn,

359
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,080
you’ll find me there.

360
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:06,610
I haven’t decided if I still want you.

361
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:09,700
Well…

362
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,920
When can you decide?

363
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:23,400
Then stop just memorizing things,

364
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,750
and stay on top of the game with your hot chocolate.

365
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,640
Okay?

366
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,760
Yay!

367
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,110
Thank you, Mr. Veekit!

368
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:33,440
I’ll do my best.

369
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,470
I’ll be very thorough and totally efficient.

370
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:39,650
And I won’t— I won’t ever make any more mistakes.

371
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:40,740
Mr. Vee.

372
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:44,470
I’ll try my best to work really hard!

373
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,920
Thank you!

374
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:54,300
Oh, hey.

375
00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:00,900
This place, and what I told you, keep them secrets.

376
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:05,760
I don’t know why I told you, but since I already did…

377
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:10,520
You gotta keep them secrets. Top secrets.

378
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,500
If one person finds out about this, you’re fired.

379
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,410
You’re fired 100 times over.

380
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:17,670
I understand.

381
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:19,240
I totally understand.

382
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,410
I won’t tell anyone.

383
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:23,050
Good job.

384
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:24,320
Promise?

385
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,990
Promise.

386
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:49,420
Did my close-up beauty blow you away?

387
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:52,820
Wow, give it a rest, sir.

388
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:57,010
You’re not exactly Gong Yoo, you know?

389
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:58,230
Oh, hey.

390
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,000
Just now when you pledged your loyalty to me,

391
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,130
you said you’d work hard and help me with everything.

392
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:04,830
Did you mean it?

393
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:05,990
Of course.

394
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:09,050
I am Mirin, a woman of her word.

395
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:10,160
You sure?

396
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,420
Yes.

397
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,970
Good.

398
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:15,890
We’ll see, then.

399
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,890
Are you looking at me?

400
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:51,150
I hardly ever see you smile, sir.

401
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:54,030
Was I smiling?

402
00:29:55,170 --> 00:30:00,150
Oh, it must have been because of the tea.

403
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,040
Alright.

404
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,460
Here.

405
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,150
For you.

406
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,830
Thank you.

407
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,690
Mr. Vee, can’t you shorten your strides just a little bit?

408
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:24,220
It’s not my fault your legs are short.

409
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,220
Mr. Vee.

410
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,720
Listen.

411
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,770
If you want to stay with me, then there are things you need to readjust.

412
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:35,240
Your short legs, for one, need to learn to keep up.

413
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,350
One more important thing,

414
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:42,660
get used to my gorgeous mug before your cheeks burn any redder.

415
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:45,150
Let’s get going.

416
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,060
Yes, sir.

417
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,000
I’m not feeling anything.

418
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,450
Not at all.

419
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:02,330
What are you complaining about?

420
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,660
Nothing.

421
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,490
Hey.

422
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:06,740
I know I’m very handsome.

423
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,740
That’s not something I can control.

424
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:12,060
So it’s you who needs to get used to it.

425
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,330
You hear me?

426
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,810
Yes.

427
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:22,280
Loud and clear, Mr. Handsome.

428
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,280
You know, I think—

429
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:35,080
Who the hell just falls asleep right after talking like that?

430
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:03,150
Thank you.

431
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,480
Goodbye.

432
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:13,660
See you tomorrow.

433
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:16,140
But tomorrow’s Saturday.

434
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,200
It is.

435
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,040
But you pledged your loyalty, so you’re coming with me.

436
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,790
’Kay?

437
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:25,170
But you have an appointment with Tanya tomorrow?

438
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:26,840
Exactly.

439
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,890
Meet me at the restaurant.

440
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:31,280
Dress up and don’t smell like traffic.

441
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,450
Bye.

442
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,550
Hey.

443
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:53,410
I bet it’s too late for you to grow a few more inches at this age, huh?

444
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:55,840
The height of your shoulders are subpar.

445
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,450
My neck hurts.

446
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:59,190
That’s coming off of your salary, by the way.

447
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:00,820
Let’s go.

448
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:03,270
You–You—

449
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:06,060
What a pain in the butt!

450
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,690
You pole-head jerk!

451
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:09,690
You–You radio pole of a person!

452
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:11,680
If you’re so tall, why don’t you try touching the damn sky!

453
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:28,280
Today was supposed to be a private date, Veekit.

454
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,760
Oh, that’s right.

455
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,690
But my secretary promised to work really hard.

456
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:35,690
So I had to take her with me.

457
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:42,880
This is urgent. Excuse me.

458
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,690
Yes?

459
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:55,110
You being here on your boss’s date is rather like

460
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:58,700
when a dog knows its owner is getting a new girlfriend.

461
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,840
Don’t you think?

462
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:06,680
I think it was possible for you to say something like, “No, I won’t go, sir” to him.

463
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:13,280
But instead you used beautiful excuses like “I’ll work hard” to be here?

464
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,970
Now it looks like I’m the bad guy who has to bring this up.

465
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:19,510
You’re right.

466
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:23,740
I could have stayed home and avoided displeasing you.

467
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:26,400
But I’m working for Mr. Veekit,

468
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,060
so it is his displeasure that I’m choosing to avoid.

469
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:33,490
Are you saying coming to see me is a displeasure to him?

470
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:38,650
That is something I believe isn’t beyond your well-educated comprehension.

471
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,940
Neeraaumpan.

472
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:43,130
Yes, Miss Tanya?

473
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:47,510
I expected more obedience from an employee like you.

474
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:52,490
Well, who expected discrimination, small-mindedness, and cruelty from you

475
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,990
for you to say such things to me?

476
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,134
I’m just testing the waters to see if

477
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:00,790
you’d bite back if I chose to be cruel.

478
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:03,630
And you sure would, huh?

479
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,330
You know why?

480
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:12,250
Because it’s supposed to be a date between me and the guy I like.

481
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:15,550
I expected to have a good time with him.

482
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:18,930
But you chose to show up uninvited.

483
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:20,680
That’s already stupid enough.

484
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,350
But arguing with me like this

485
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:26,730
is an even more stupid thing to do.

486
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:28,128
You know, one word from me

487
00:35:28,153 --> 00:35:30,550
and I can have anyone at Next Innovation fire you.

488
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,850
Miss Tanya.

489
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:34,880
If you still think you can talk back,

490
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,840
think again.

491
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,740
You’re just an employee.

492
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,970
Alright. That’s enough.

493
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,010
You’ve done your damage.

494
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:44,020
You can love my boss all you want,

495
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:46,300
but I still have a job to do.

496
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:49,760
So don’t give me trouble for doing my job like this, it isn’t cool.

497
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,610
You want me fired? Just do it.

498
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:54,050
If you can, that is.

499
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:55,995
But I doubt anyone else feels as entitled

500
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:59,454
and privilege-crazed as you to play along.

501
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:13,650
What were you talking about?

502
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,960
We weren’t talking.

503
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,840
I was just teaching your employee about impropriety.

504
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:25,620
But she argued and challenged me.

505
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,620
What a mannerless oaf.

506
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:32,580
I find she barely talks back unless provoked.

507
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,850
Veekit.

508
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:37,550
You’re embarrassing me, you know that?

509
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,550
It’s our date.

510
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:41,940
But you came here with your secretary,

511
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:44,710
and now you protect her on top of that?

512
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,240
I’m not okay with this.

513
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:51,730
Well, then you have my apology.

514
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:55,560
But catering to what you like or don’t like is not something…

515
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:59,420
I’m interested in doing.

516
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:02,190
Excuse me.

517
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:04,820
Veekit.

518
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,600
Just fire me if you want.

519
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:23,790
I’m fine with that.

520
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,660
What made you think I’d do that?

521
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:28,140
You—

522
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,700
I have my principles.

523
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,150
I nitpick and scold you

524
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:38,460
because I know what you have and what you lack.

525
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:42,260
When people insult or look down on you,

526
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,880
it’s because they don’t know you.

527
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:50,300
You have to get better and be great so other people respect you.

528
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,180
What I’m trying to say is

529
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,210
I don’t want people to look down on you.

530
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:04,700
You’re…

531
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:13,720
Cool, aren’t I?

532
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,200
Sorry?

533
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:19,970
Wait.

534
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:21,970
I just remembered something.

535
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:26,920
Aew-eas said you made a cake for me yesterday.

536
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,250
Oh.

537
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,910
Yes, I did.

538
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:31,910
It was supposed to be an apology.

539
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:39,170
But you weren’t there, so Mr. Chanon and I ate it.

540
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:40,630
What?

541
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:45,290
You gave my apology cake to someone else?

542
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:46,850
But…

543
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:50,560
You can’t just give away what’s mine.

544
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,940
Be it drinks, pastries, or whatever you make for me.

545
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,590
If I weren’t there,

546
00:38:55,590 --> 00:39:00,060
you were supposed to let them rot right where you put them.

547
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,670
Mr. Vee, calm down.

548
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:03,970
It was just a cake.

549
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:06,640
I can make you another in an hour.

550
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,420
Alright.

551
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,360
That’s what we’re going to do.

552
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,850
What? Do what?

553
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:12,680
Bake me that damn cake.

554
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,410
Now!

555
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:14,370
What?

556
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:15,810
Now?

557
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:17,580
What’s with you?

558
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:18,870
Short-term memory loss?

559
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:20,870
Right-Now!

560
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,680
Hi.

561
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,680
Your date fell through?

562
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,370
Of course it did.

563
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:51,800
Your little cousin brought his secretary.

564
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,360
Mirin?

565
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,140
Who’s Mirin?

566
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,140
It was Neearaaumpan.

567
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,040
That’s her.

568
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,040
Mirin’s her nickname.

569
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,670
But what’s she still doing here?

570
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:10,860
I heard she made some huge mistake.

571
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,400
Why is she still hired?

572
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,400
She’s actually an amazing person.

573
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,850
She’s ambitious and a fast learner.

574
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:20,570
I still don’t get it.

575
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:25,010
She’s nothing better than the rest.

576
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:27,380
That’s who Veekit’s been looking for?

577
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:32,220
After all the years of looking, he settled for this dork?

578
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:36,200
He took her side so much that he even embarrassed me.

579
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:40,910
Don’t tell me the great Tanya is scared of that “dork”?

580
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:43,360
Non, shut up.

581
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,720
I’ll have you know I’m very unhappy with what you said.

582
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,930
I’m not scared.

583
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:52,710
I’m just surprised.

584
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:56,320
You didn’t see them when they were alone.

585
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,320
They have this chemistry.

586
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:01,550
I’ve never seen Veekit like that with anyone.

587
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:03,120
Don’t you get it?

588
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,220
Hey, be quiet.

589
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:29,510
My mother and grandmother are sleeping.

590
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:36,470
Hey, turn the lights on.

591
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:36,960
Hey!

592
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,520
I said be quiet!

593
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,390
Mirin!

594
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:01,640
You–You!

595
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,920
You dare sneak a man into my home?

596
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,920
What? What’s going on?

597
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,810
Who are you—

598
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:08,430
Look. Look.

599
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:09,750
Look.

600
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:12,280
Mirin, what’s going on?

601
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,650
It’s not what you think, Mom.

602
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:15,620
Listen to m—

603
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:16,810
I will not!

604
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:17,730
Mom!

605
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:18,270
Mom, Mom!

606
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:19,250
Mom, stop!

607
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:20,480
Grandma, please!

608
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,710
Mom, stop it!

609
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:22,160
Mom!

610
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,140
- Grandma! - Please, listen to me!

611
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,040
Mom, just listen to them first.

612
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:27,000
I didn’t do anything!

613
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:29,700
I would never do it with your granddaughter.

614
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,410
What?

615
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:31,570
You wouldn’t?

616
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:32,520
Not with your granddaughter.

617
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,800
What’s wrong with her?

618
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,230
My granddaughter is beautiful, smart, and talented.

619
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:38,240
- You–You mouthy brat. - 	Mom.

620
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,820
God willing, I have to slap some manners into him!

621
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:41,240
Mom!

622
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:41,930
Oh, dear!

623
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:42,480
Mom!

624
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,140
Stop it.

625
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,240
Let me just!

626
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,580
Stop!

627
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,100
Grandma.

628
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,730
Listen to me.

629
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:54,090
He’s my boss.

630
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:55,550
Hmm?

631
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:56,800
He’s your what?

632
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,530
My boss.

633
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:07,690
I’m just here for some cakes, ma’am.

634
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,690
What is his name?

635
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:15,130
Mr. Veekit Kraipiwat.

636
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:19,060
The CEO of Next Innovation.

637
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:26,270
Hello.

638
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,210
Hi.

639
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,680
Hello, ma’am.

640
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:44,680
Directed by Ekkasit Trakulkasemsuk and Pantip Vibultham

641
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:56,380
Is this the church you mentioned?

642
00:43:57,310 --> 00:43:58,380
Yes.

643
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:02,710
Are you really going to stay here when—

644
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:04,710
I am.

645
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:06,680
I will stay here.

646
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:13,830
Can you and your daughter

647
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:17,290
please keep this a secret for me?

648
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:35,930
Come on.

649
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:37,310
Help me make that cake.

650
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:38,680
You’re supposed to make it for me.

651
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,850
I’m baking something for someone else, too.

652
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:41,980
I need your help.

653
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:44,720
There’s no way you can right this wrong.

654
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,260
If he finds out one day,

655
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:49,820
you’re not the only one who’ll be in trouble.

656
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,820
Your name is Neeraaumpan?

657
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:54,230
Who gave you that name?

658
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:58,450
If she really is gone, Veekit will have no one but me.

659
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:02,230
I want to be completely sure that Veekit really has no one left.

660
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:06,520
We’re looking for Big Noi, the king among investors.

661
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:06,940
Sir!

662
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:10,930
Are you the big brother Chanon who loves his baby cousin very much,

663
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,180
or the Chanon who just wants the best for himself?

664
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:17,410
I have to find Big Noi.
