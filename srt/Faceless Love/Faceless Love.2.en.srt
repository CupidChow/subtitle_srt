1
00:00:00,721 --> 00:00:04,450
Get her something that people in this century actually wear.

2
00:00:04,819 --> 00:00:08,630
Not something that makes it look like fashion died in the year 2000.

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,052
If you don't change your look,

4
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:15,305
what'd he tell the other candidates why he chose you?

5
00:00:15,687 --> 00:00:16,700
Mr. Non.

6
00:00:24,341 --> 00:00:26,021
You're an attractive book now.

7
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:27,704
Trust me.

8
00:00:27,836 --> 00:00:30,578
Here comes your first test as my secretary.

9
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:34,019
And that is making hot chocolate.

10
00:00:47,971 --> 00:00:49,307
Neeraaumpan.

11
00:00:58,107 --> 00:00:59,218
Mom.

12
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:09,104
Mom, come back to me.

13
00:01:14,907 --> 00:01:16,318
Let's have ice cream.

14
00:01:16,617 --> 00:01:18,021
Don't tell my mom about it.

15
00:01:18,022 --> 00:01:19,209
She will scold us.

16
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:26,021
- Eat it. - Non.

17
00:01:32,596 --> 00:01:33,604
Eat it.

18
00:01:46,341 --> 00:01:47,442
Don't worry.

19
00:01:47,443 --> 00:01:50,021
I'll take care of you from now on.

20
00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:53,566
I want to see my mom.

21
00:01:54,096 --> 00:01:55,791
Where is my mom?

22
00:01:57,142 --> 00:01:58,797
Do you want to share my mom?

23
00:01:58,798 --> 00:02:00,901
I can share everything with you.

24
00:02:02,173 --> 00:02:03,975
Just like I share this ice cream with you.

25
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,730
Jirawat Sutivanichsak.

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,050
Supassara Thanachart.

27
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,330
Ishikawa Plowden.

28
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,930
Phatchatorn Thanawat / Wanwimol Jaenasavamethee.

29
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,290
Phanuroj Chalermkijporntavee / Chayakorn Jutamas.

30
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,610
Directed by Ekkasit Trakulkasemsuk and Pantip Vibultham.

31
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,610
WHAT EXACTLY IS MY SECRETARY'S NAME?

32
00:04:38,606 --> 00:04:40,019
Where did you learn how to make it?

33
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:44,502
I don't need to take a lesson to make a hot chocolate.

34
00:04:45,322 --> 00:04:46,322
Liar.

35
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:49,406
Do you know?

36
00:04:49,799 --> 00:04:52,019
I have hired 58 secretaries.

37
00:04:52,155 --> 00:04:54,605
I've had 37 job openings for maids.

38
00:04:55,675 --> 00:04:59,506
But no one could make the hot chocolate the way I wanted.

39
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,999
Even though I traveled to Germany,

40
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:05,110
New York,

41
00:05:05,341 --> 00:05:06,400
Spain,

42
00:05:06,792 --> 00:05:07,792
California,

43
00:05:07,865 --> 00:05:08,897
Mexico,

44
00:05:08,898 --> 00:05:09,974
Switzerland,

45
00:05:10,473 --> 00:05:11,526
and Belgium.

46
00:05:11,823 --> 00:05:14,417
I went to every place that is famous for chocolate.

47
00:05:14,418 --> 00:05:17,980
I have never tasted a hot chocolate like yours.

48
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,019
I only live in Nonthaburi.

49
00:05:21,162 --> 00:05:22,307
That's not the point.

50
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,407
The point is...

51
00:05:25,768 --> 00:05:29,383
you need to tell me where you learned the recipe from.

52
00:05:31,117 --> 00:05:32,565
You told me to wait

53
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,108
because you didn't have the ingredients

54
00:05:35,133 --> 00:05:37,640
to make the hot chocolate that I wanted.

55
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,599
How did you know what ingredients you needed to make this hot chocolate?

56
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,702
My mom.

57
00:05:45,026 --> 00:05:46,305
I learned from my mom.

58
00:05:46,657 --> 00:05:49,508
But I don't know where she learned it from.

59
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,407
She probably learned it from a pastry class.

60
00:05:55,808 --> 00:05:57,204
A pastry class?

61
00:05:58,151 --> 00:05:59,303
I don't think so.

62
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:02,354
If that was so, I would have found it a long time ago.

63
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,407
This is a big world.

64
00:06:04,653 --> 00:06:07,977
What you know may not be everything.

65
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,405
I told you that you need to listen to other people.

66
00:06:10,574 --> 00:06:13,217
Now, you can't fire me.

67
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:17,703
I'm going to keep this recipe a secret for my career's security.

68
00:06:18,248 --> 00:06:21,208
I'm going to tell you to teach the recipe to all the maids in the company.

69
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,199
No, I won't.

70
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,320
I will never do that.

71
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,920
How much do you want?

72
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:30,795
How much do you want for the recipe?

73
00:06:31,059 --> 00:06:32,059
No.

74
00:06:32,336 --> 00:06:33,602
I want to work.

75
00:06:33,807 --> 00:06:34,808
I'm talented.

76
00:06:35,093 --> 00:06:38,607
I prove to you that I can do more than make hot chocolate.

77
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,306
Though you can make the hot chocolate the way I want,

78
00:06:43,743 --> 00:06:46,022
or you have improved your fashion sense

79
00:06:46,376 --> 00:06:50,017
from the old era to the modern one,

80
00:06:50,613 --> 00:06:52,518
you still have a lot to prove yourself.

81
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:56,411
I memorized all the information about the company that you gave me.

82
00:06:57,099 --> 00:07:01,013
Wait and see, the chocolate maker.

83
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,774
With this kind of mouth, you won't be able to drink anything.

84
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,739
Don't say anything that crosses the line.

85
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,807
Bear in mind.

86
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,105
I have good ears.

87
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,220
I also have a good sense of smell.

88
00:07:11,872 --> 00:07:17,166
I can smell everything including your overconfidence and laziness.

89
00:07:17,167 --> 00:07:18,258
I'm not overconfident.

90
00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:19,489
I believe I have all the skills.

91
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,718
I'm confident about that.

92
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,170
Fine.

93
00:07:24,727 --> 00:07:25,927
Go make me another hot chocolate.

94
00:07:25,928 --> 00:07:27,105
Make it fast.

95
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,017
If the taste is different,

96
00:07:31,546 --> 00:07:32,946
It means that this is just a fluke.

97
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,148
If you falsely claim that you have the skill to make the drink,

98
00:07:36,149 --> 00:07:38,019
and have the audacity to talk back at me,

99
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:39,979
I will fire you.

100
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,014
Three times in a row.

101
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:46,925
Please wait a minute.

102
00:08:06,632 --> 00:08:07,706
How is it?

103
00:08:08,485 --> 00:08:11,502
He's domineering, self-centered, and unprofessional.

104
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,375
He never trusts anyone.

105
00:08:13,376 --> 00:08:16,696
He ordered me to make another hot chocolate to prove that I didn't make it by luck.

106
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:18,997
That's him.

107
00:08:19,034 --> 00:08:20,505
You learn about him quickly.

108
00:08:23,204 --> 00:08:25,702
This is Manit, the head of the IT department.

109
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,300
Hello, Manit.

110
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:32,905
This is Maewkwak, the new programmer we recently hired.

111
00:08:33,682 --> 00:08:38,205
Your name is Maneki Neko in Japanese, beckoning cats.

112
00:08:40,911 --> 00:08:42,426
This is Mi...

113
00:08:46,038 --> 00:08:47,801
I'm Neeraaumpan.

114
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,017
Right.

115
00:08:50,705 --> 00:08:51,982
I'll go in first.

116
00:08:52,303 --> 00:08:54,401
If you finish making the drink, follow us into his room.

117
00:08:54,402 --> 00:08:55,402
Alright.

118
00:09:07,053 --> 00:09:08,194
That is quick.

119
00:09:08,925 --> 00:09:09,925
What is quick?

120
00:09:17,955 --> 00:09:21,220
This is Maewkwak, the new programmer we recently hired.

121
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,416
Your name is Maneki Neko in Japanese, beckoning cats.

122
00:09:27,837 --> 00:09:30,017
You said exactly the same thing as your secretary.

123
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,404
Huh?

124
00:09:35,334 --> 00:09:37,807
Manit and Maewkwak, please have a seat.

125
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,554
Do you have any updates or comments?

126
00:09:45,817 --> 00:09:49,608
I want to fix bugs on the Good Life app.

127
00:09:50,229 --> 00:09:52,367
The app is not slow during the day

128
00:09:52,368 --> 00:09:53,802
because the user traffic is low.

129
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,434
But the app is lagging during the morning and evening.

130
00:09:56,435 --> 00:10:00,908
It runs slower than a snail from the Jurassic era.

131
00:10:02,017 --> 00:10:06,020
As slow as a snail from the Jurassic era.

132
00:10:10,951 --> 00:10:12,170
You are meticulous.

133
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:14,197
Thank you.

134
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,324
I also want to you add the languages of neighboring countries to the app as soon as possible.

135
00:10:20,325 --> 00:10:25,217
I want the details of the theme of all the festivals that will be held next year within this week.

136
00:10:29,082 --> 00:10:31,004
Rome wasn't built in a day.

137
00:10:32,477 --> 00:10:35,480
But God created the world in seven days.

138
00:10:35,897 --> 00:10:38,019
No, He created it in six days.

139
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,305
He rested on the 7th day.

140
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,705
I'm not working with the Romans.

141
00:10:43,706 --> 00:10:45,200
I'm working with God.

142
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,509
He's overbearing.

143
00:10:53,725 --> 00:10:55,424
How could we finish all that in a week?

144
00:10:55,425 --> 00:10:56,703
I'll try.

145
00:10:56,977 --> 00:10:58,019
I'll do my best.

146
00:10:58,226 --> 00:10:59,979
You helped me to get the job.

147
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,017
Veekit is so annoying.

148
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,390
Don't forget about the thank you party for our partners this evening.

149
00:11:16,391 --> 00:11:17,414
It's important.

150
00:11:17,888 --> 00:11:18,888
I got it.

151
00:11:19,848 --> 00:11:21,976
I have a fun idea.

152
00:11:22,835 --> 00:11:23,835
What is it?

153
00:11:28,228 --> 00:11:30,407
I'm going to take her on a field trip.

154
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,503
I want to see if she can handle it.

155
00:11:39,397 --> 00:11:42,416
I'll take Neeraaumpan to get dressed this afternoon.

156
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,260
It's okay.

157
00:11:45,007 --> 00:11:46,508
You can go home to get ready.

158
00:11:47,361 --> 00:11:48,508
I'll take care of it.

159
00:11:49,752 --> 00:11:52,272
I'm going to test if she did the homework I gave her yesterday.

160
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,315
Is there anything you want me to do?

161
00:11:55,607 --> 00:11:56,607
Yes.

162
00:12:04,607 --> 00:12:06,847
This is the guest list attending the party this evening.

163
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,680
You have to go to the party with me.

164
00:12:08,865 --> 00:12:09,702
Huh?

165
00:12:09,702 --> 00:12:10,702
Do what I said.

166
00:12:10,982 --> 00:12:12,508
Memorize all of it by this evening.

167
00:12:12,942 --> 00:12:14,508
Go out and get ready.

168
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:17,022
You need to go dress shopping with me.

169
00:12:17,558 --> 00:12:18,251
But I...

170
00:12:18,252 --> 00:12:19,503
Quiet.

171
00:12:19,711 --> 00:12:20,230
I don't want to argue with you.

172
00:12:20,231 --> 00:12:21,631
I'm going to have my hot chocolate.

173
00:12:22,047 --> 00:12:23,047
Go.

174
00:12:42,672 --> 00:12:43,672
Can I taste it?

175
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,620
Why?

176
00:12:47,407 --> 00:12:50,515
I want to know the taste of the hot chocolate that you have searched for.

177
00:12:52,152 --> 00:12:52,733
What?

178
00:12:52,733 --> 00:12:53,465
No.

179
00:12:53,465 --> 00:12:54,078
You won't let me taste it?

180
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:54,816
No.

181
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:56,738
You are stingy with the drink.

182
00:12:56,739 --> 00:12:57,973
No, I'm not.

183
00:12:57,974 --> 00:12:59,214
You need to go get it yourself.

184
00:12:59,434 --> 00:13:00,611
Give it to me.

185
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:14,594
When is it going to be a lunch break?

186
00:13:14,595 --> 00:13:16,509
I'm so hungry.

187
00:13:25,432 --> 00:13:26,903
How did I forget it?

188
00:13:36,158 --> 00:13:37,548
It'll help me survive until lunchtime.

189
00:13:37,549 --> 00:13:38,705
This is great.

190
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:43,448
What are they playing at?

191
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:48,610
If you gave it to me, it wouldn't have ended up like this.

192
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:50,687
What happened?

193
00:13:52,528 --> 00:13:53,528
Thank you.

194
00:14:13,677 --> 00:14:14,900
What are you doing?

195
00:14:16,275 --> 00:14:17,605
Today must be your lucky day.

196
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:20,207
I forgot that you are here.

197
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:22,831
It's okay.

198
00:14:22,832 --> 00:14:24,437
But don't do it again.

199
00:14:24,438 --> 00:14:25,708
It's inappropriate.

200
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:29,005
You should be respectful to women though they are your employees.

201
00:14:30,613 --> 00:14:31,977
Apologize to me.

202
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:38,602
- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.

203
00:14:40,874 --> 00:14:41,874
Good.

204
00:14:45,034 --> 00:14:46,619
Since we are done with the apology, we need to get going.

205
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,620
You, Ugly Duckling.

206
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,050
Huh?

207
00:14:49,241 --> 00:14:53,407
I'm going to transform you from an ugly duckling into a swan.

208
00:14:54,365 --> 00:14:55,365
Follow me.

209
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,020
Hurry up, Ugly Duckling.

210
00:15:03,045 --> 00:15:04,045
Yes.

211
00:15:36,691 --> 00:15:37,717
Let's start.

212
00:16:54,854 --> 00:16:55,977
You...

213
00:16:56,718 --> 00:16:59,108
Your lips and nose are petite.

214
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:02,600
Your facial features are small like toppings on pizza bianca.

215
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:11,977
Can I have earrings from the latest collection of Methinee?

216
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:13,188
Not small ones.

217
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:15,002
I want medium to large size ones.

218
00:17:15,394 --> 00:17:16,703
I want them to stand out.

219
00:17:36,859 --> 00:17:38,508
Where is Veekit?

220
00:17:53,337 --> 00:17:57,005
The party we are going to is held to thank our partners and investors.

221
00:17:57,308 --> 00:18:00,016
Though we hold the party to thank them,

222
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:04,020
the other purpose is to get more investment.

223
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,708
I have to apologize for being late.

224
00:18:21,306 --> 00:18:25,979
First of all, I would like to thank our partners for joining us tonight.

225
00:18:26,195 --> 00:18:30,309
Without you, Next Innovation would have never come this far.

226
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:32,210
Thank you.

227
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:34,400
To our partnership,

228
00:18:35,056 --> 00:18:36,056
Cheers.

229
00:18:38,441 --> 00:18:40,217
I admire you, Veekit.

230
00:18:57,558 --> 00:19:01,977
You need to be next to me and tell me who is walking towards me.

231
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:05,103
Are you that bad at remembering faces?

232
00:19:07,088 --> 00:19:09,364
Whether I am good or bad at it, that's none of your business.

233
00:19:09,388 --> 00:19:12,825
What you need to do is do your job well, the data storage device.

234
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,429
Data storage device?

235
00:19:18,303 --> 00:19:19,982
That's Tanya, Chanon's friend.

236
00:19:22,721 --> 00:19:25,082
Thank you, Tanya.

237
00:19:26,343 --> 00:19:28,310
I hope you enjoy the party.

238
00:19:28,826 --> 00:19:29,982
Please have fun.

239
00:19:40,702 --> 00:19:42,607
Mr. Kitti and Mr. Tawatchai.

240
00:19:43,032 --> 00:19:44,032
Mr. Kitti.

241
00:19:44,361 --> 00:19:45,361
Hello.

242
00:19:45,558 --> 00:19:46,698
How are you?

243
00:19:46,699 --> 00:19:47,830
Mr. Tawatchai, right?

244
00:19:47,831 --> 00:19:48,204
Yes.

245
00:19:48,204 --> 00:19:49,204
Hello.

246
00:19:54,622 --> 00:19:57,980
You have your grand opening by arriving late.

247
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,420
So you can be the center of attention.

248
00:20:02,752 --> 00:20:03,980
You did a good job earlier.

249
00:20:04,542 --> 00:20:05,604
Thank you.

250
00:20:06,724 --> 00:20:07,802
Good job?

251
00:20:08,109 --> 00:20:09,781
I have to dig her in the ribs to remind her to do her job.

252
00:20:09,782 --> 00:20:11,622
Her ribs would be fractured when she gets old.

253
00:20:12,571 --> 00:20:15,502
Are you saying I will get to do this job until I am old?

254
00:20:16,509 --> 00:20:17,509
Veekit.

255
00:20:20,795 --> 00:20:22,209
Long time no see.

256
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:23,217
I miss you.

257
00:20:24,019 --> 00:20:25,706
Hello, Miss Tanya.

258
00:20:28,906 --> 00:20:29,906
Yes.

259
00:20:33,798 --> 00:20:35,980
When are you going to stop calling me Miss Tanya?

260
00:20:40,588 --> 00:20:44,305
Your favorite fine dining restaurant hired a new chef from abroad.

261
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,960
Why don't we go and taste his food together?

262
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:49,208
If I have a chance, I'll go.

263
00:20:50,253 --> 00:20:52,407
Then I'll create a chance for you.

264
00:20:53,155 --> 00:20:55,207
This Saturday at 6 pm.

265
00:20:56,103 --> 00:20:59,977
I want to invest in the application business.

266
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,308
I think you can give me good advice.

267
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:06,201
I'll have Neeraaumpan contact you.

268
00:21:06,742 --> 00:21:08,645
I need to check first if I have other schedules.

269
00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:09,669
Excuse me.

270
00:21:09,816 --> 00:21:12,308
I started to feel dizzy because of your perfume.

271
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:15,330
Veekit.

272
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,404
You should tone down your perfume.

273
00:21:24,955 --> 00:21:27,165
Do you know that you are being rude?

274
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:29,446
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

275
00:21:29,447 --> 00:21:33,314
Make sure that he will be available to meet me this Saturday at 6 pm.

276
00:21:35,111 --> 00:21:36,908
I'll check his schedule.

277
00:21:37,785 --> 00:21:39,509
I didn't tell you to check his schedule.

278
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:42,184
I told you to make sure he will be available at the given time.

279
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:45,401
If he has another schedule, you need to postpone it.

280
00:21:45,785 --> 00:21:47,505
I have an important thing to talk with him.

281
00:21:48,955 --> 00:21:50,370
I'll try.

282
00:21:56,629 --> 00:21:59,979
Tanya is self-willed.

283
00:22:01,888 --> 00:22:03,396
You don't need to worry.

284
00:22:03,397 --> 00:22:04,607
She isn't a bad person.

285
00:22:06,232 --> 00:22:11,111
Aew-eas will introduce you to all the department heads.

286
00:22:11,948 --> 00:22:13,204
Sure.

287
00:22:20,351 --> 00:22:23,511
She probably wants to discuss important matters with him.

288
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,306
It may be about the business.

289
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,408
She may want to be a unicorn.

290
00:22:30,865 --> 00:22:34,407
There is another creature that has horns like unicorns.

291
00:22:34,601 --> 00:22:35,696
It's called horny.

292
00:22:35,697 --> 00:22:36,816
Aew-eas!

293
00:22:39,422 --> 00:22:41,974
You don't like Tanya, do you?

294
00:22:42,214 --> 00:22:43,494
She isn't a nice person, is she?

295
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:47,729
If you meet her a few more times,

296
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:49,977
you will not ask me that question again.

297
00:22:50,303 --> 00:22:52,805
She is beyond not being nice.

298
00:22:53,682 --> 00:22:55,963
Don't believe her words about asking for business advice.

299
00:22:56,023 --> 00:22:59,690
Her family is so wealthy that they don't need to work for several generations.

300
00:23:04,927 --> 00:23:06,306
Excuse me.

301
00:23:06,911 --> 00:23:07,970
Sure.

302
00:23:13,263 --> 00:23:15,105
I haven't seen you for some time.

303
00:23:15,226 --> 00:23:16,226
Right.

304
00:23:16,576 --> 00:23:17,977
I've been busy lately.

305
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:19,309
How about you?

306
00:23:20,235 --> 00:23:21,982
I'm not that busy.

307
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:25,760
But Chanon is super busy with work.

308
00:23:26,311 --> 00:23:29,976
He brings Veekit's work home and works on it until dawn almost every day.

309
00:23:30,822 --> 00:23:34,503
I feel sorry to see him exhausted from busy work.

310
00:23:37,066 --> 00:23:38,708
They have different toils.

311
00:23:39,111 --> 00:23:42,816
Veekit and Chanon have their own responsibilities.

312
00:23:43,241 --> 00:23:45,980
You shouldn't expect them to have the same toil.

313
00:23:48,512 --> 00:23:49,804
I should go greet the guests.

314
00:23:50,466 --> 00:23:51,702
Yes, Dad.

315
00:23:58,318 --> 00:24:00,370
Did Veekit displease you again?

316
00:24:01,263 --> 00:24:02,263
Yes.

317
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:05,977
He refused to make time to meet me or give me advice several times.

318
00:24:08,534 --> 00:24:13,207
If Veekit is busy, why don't you go ask for advice from Chanon?

319
00:24:13,389 --> 00:24:16,808
Chanon is helping Veekit with most of his work.

320
00:24:19,874 --> 00:24:21,001
Alright.

321
00:24:23,642 --> 00:24:26,706
One day, Chanon will have his own business.

322
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,440
He won't be helping Veekit's business for the rest of his life.

323
00:24:29,853 --> 00:24:35,305
Chanon's business will be much bigger than Next Innovation.

324
00:24:42,309 --> 00:24:43,309
Thank you.

325
00:24:45,075 --> 00:24:46,075
Non.

326
00:24:46,546 --> 00:24:47,708
Come here.

327
00:24:50,219 --> 00:24:51,219
Yes, Grandpa.

328
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:55,718
Your mom said you feel exhausted from work lately.

329
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:00,416
No.

330
00:25:00,696 --> 00:25:02,596
My mom is too worried about me.

331
00:25:02,597 --> 00:25:03,811
That's what I think.

332
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,811
Your mom just doesn't get it.

333
00:25:06,524 --> 00:25:09,201
Men in your age need to work hard.

334
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,620
There are many things for you to work on and build.

335
00:25:12,269 --> 00:25:13,407
I get it.

336
00:25:14,494 --> 00:25:18,208
I don't want you to sweat the small stuff like whose work it is.

337
00:25:18,782 --> 00:25:22,308
I want you to think that the work you do, you do it for me.

338
00:25:23,318 --> 00:25:24,318
Yes.

339
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,106
Great.

340
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,805
Mr. Vee.

341
00:25:44,524 --> 00:25:46,200
Where have you been?

342
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:48,068
You said you would be next to me all the time.

343
00:25:48,069 --> 00:25:49,208
Did you forget that?

344
00:25:49,456 --> 00:25:50,971
Didn't you say you have a good memory?

345
00:25:50,995 --> 00:25:53,405
I have to walk around to find a place to hide.

346
00:25:54,115 --> 00:25:57,108
You left the extra bomb called Tanya with me.

347
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:58,511
Don't you remember that?

348
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:01,301
She really wants to meet up with you.

349
00:26:01,302 --> 00:26:02,357
I don't care.

350
00:26:02,358 --> 00:26:03,593
I don't want to see her.

351
00:26:03,594 --> 00:26:06,417
Your job is to make sure that I won't be available to meet her.

352
00:26:06,561 --> 00:26:07,561
Do you get it?

353
00:26:08,453 --> 00:26:09,453
Yes.

354
00:26:09,813 --> 00:26:12,114
Are you ready to go back to the party?

355
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:16,850
Yes.

356
00:26:17,362 --> 00:26:19,416
If you are ready, you should smile.

357
00:26:19,417 --> 00:26:20,865
You need to smile more.

358
00:26:36,405 --> 00:26:37,405
Mr. Vee.

359
00:26:39,379 --> 00:26:43,506
That's Methawee, an important partner who invested in your applications.

360
00:26:51,291 --> 00:26:52,291
Veekit.

361
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:53,979
Hello, Methawee.

362
00:26:54,631 --> 00:26:55,480
How are you doing?

363
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:56,805
I'm good.

364
00:26:57,745 --> 00:26:58,411
Hello.

365
00:26:58,564 --> 00:26:59,564
Chanon.

366
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,900
I'm waiting to invest in all the applications that you will launch next year.

367
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,607
I come to meet you to talk about them.

368
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,700
But first, I want to introduce her to you.

369
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:13,508
This is Neeraaumpan, my new secretary.

370
00:27:14,493 --> 00:27:16,207
Hello, Methawee.

371
00:27:17,201 --> 00:27:19,975
Next year, we will launch two new applications.

372
00:27:19,976 --> 00:27:25,262
The first one is Be Friend which you already invested with us.

373
00:27:25,263 --> 00:27:28,505
The other one is an application that we are proud to present.

374
00:27:28,506 --> 00:27:30,604
It's called "Keep Up".

375
00:27:31,502 --> 00:27:32,908
That sounds interesting.

376
00:27:33,102 --> 00:27:34,908
What kind of application is it?

377
00:27:35,114 --> 00:27:35,717
It's an app...

378
00:27:35,718 --> 00:27:37,308
Neeraaumpan.

379
00:27:38,494 --> 00:27:40,709
Why don't you explain it to her?

380
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:46,385
Keep Up is an application to help users with weight loss.

381
00:27:46,386 --> 00:27:48,270
Based on your height and weight,

382
00:27:48,271 --> 00:27:54,301
it will design an exercise and diet routine that matches the user's weight loss goal.

383
00:27:54,302 --> 00:27:56,676
You can upload a photo of your meal into the app.

384
00:27:56,677 --> 00:27:58,779
It will calculate the approximate calories you get from the meal.

385
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:02,901
It also has exercise videos that we co-create with well-known trainers.

386
00:28:02,902 --> 00:28:05,574
So the users can target particular body parts that they want to slim down.

387
00:28:05,598 --> 00:28:08,811
Can you really make money from it?

388
00:28:09,383 --> 00:28:10,407
It's a free application.

389
00:28:10,408 --> 00:28:12,119
Anyone can use it.

390
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,105
It will have two sources of income.

391
00:28:14,106 --> 00:28:20,070
First will be income from advertisements such as supplements, exercise equipment, and music.

392
00:28:20,071 --> 00:28:21,901
The benefit will be varied among the advertisers.

393
00:28:21,902 --> 00:28:24,711
We will launch new promotion campaigns with our sponsor every quarter.

394
00:28:30,949 --> 00:28:34,700
Thank you, Methawee, for joining our party tonight.

395
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:37,602
After hearing about Keep Up from Neeraaumpan,

396
00:28:37,874 --> 00:28:42,208
I want to invest in the application If Veekit doesn't mind.

397
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:45,407
That would be my honor.

398
00:28:45,881 --> 00:28:50,608
I'll have my secretary contact you later.

399
00:28:50,742 --> 00:28:51,742
Good.

400
00:28:51,998 --> 00:28:53,976
I like your secretary.

401
00:28:54,435 --> 00:28:57,980
She is pretty, smart, and has good taste.

402
00:28:59,419 --> 00:29:02,404
The choice of your earrings tonight is great.

403
00:29:04,291 --> 00:29:06,405
But it's quite heavy.

404
00:29:06,964 --> 00:29:08,523
These are the smallest ones in the collection.

405
00:29:08,524 --> 00:29:12,063
Some of them look like light placards in concerts.

406
00:29:13,205 --> 00:29:14,767
Light placards in concerts?

407
00:29:14,768 --> 00:29:15,979
Yes.

408
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:19,004
I think they are designed for those who are wet behind the ears.

409
00:29:21,939 --> 00:29:25,207
Methinee brand has a unique design style.

410
00:29:25,678 --> 00:29:28,349
If you know about fashion, you will get it.

411
00:29:28,669 --> 00:29:32,714
I'll tell my sister to launch a more neutral design.

412
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,608
So people who don't know about fashion will get it.

413
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:37,608
Sister?

414
00:29:37,902 --> 00:29:40,608
Can I have earrings from the latest collection of Methinee?

415
00:29:41,663 --> 00:29:43,670
I have to apologize to you about Neeraaumpan's comment.

416
00:29:43,671 --> 00:29:44,801
Veekit.

417
00:29:44,927 --> 00:29:46,605
About my investment in Keep Up,

418
00:29:46,606 --> 00:29:48,955
I'll contact you later.

419
00:29:48,958 --> 00:29:52,416
I think I made my decision too hastily earlier.

420
00:29:53,173 --> 00:29:54,502
I'm so sorry.

421
00:29:54,635 --> 00:29:56,949
We didn't mean...

422
00:29:57,028 --> 00:30:01,004
What happened does not only offend me,

423
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:04,531
but it also makes me see your inadequacy

424
00:30:04,537 --> 00:30:08,808
when working with an important partner of your company.

425
00:30:09,251 --> 00:30:10,306
Excuse me.

426
00:30:15,071 --> 00:30:16,303
I am so sorry.

427
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:24,416
I'm sorry.

428
00:30:31,394 --> 00:30:32,609
Light placards?!

429
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:33,979
How could you say that?

430
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:38,502
I chose the earrings for you because I wanted to please Methawee.

431
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:43,979
But you didn't tell me who designed the earrings.

432
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,980
Don't you have any general knowledge?

433
00:30:46,074 --> 00:30:48,297
Having a good memory doesn't mean you will do your job well.

434
00:30:48,321 --> 00:30:50,656
All you can do is memorize what you are told?

435
00:30:50,657 --> 00:30:52,514
Do you have no other skills?

436
00:30:52,515 --> 00:30:56,608
You should be apologizing to me, not arguing with me like this.

437
00:30:57,727 --> 00:30:59,500
I'm sorry that I didn't know that.

438
00:31:00,084 --> 00:31:02,527
If you told me that the brand is...

439
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:06,201
Anyone in high society can tell which brand they come from after seeing them.

440
00:31:08,472 --> 00:31:10,832
Are you looking down on me because of my poor family again?

441
00:31:11,441 --> 00:31:13,205
That's all you think of me.

442
00:31:13,958 --> 00:31:17,979
I am explaining to you what you will face in this job.

443
00:31:18,216 --> 00:31:20,705
You said this is a big world.

444
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:22,582
You told me that I needed to open up to learn new things.

445
00:31:22,583 --> 00:31:23,583
What about you?

446
00:31:23,807 --> 00:31:26,425
You also need to learn and listen to other people.

447
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,405
Vee, that's enough.

448
00:31:29,659 --> 00:31:31,509
She did a good job tonight.

449
00:31:32,045 --> 00:31:34,205
She just doesn't know how to act in a party like this.

450
00:31:34,417 --> 00:31:36,399
We should talk about this tomorrow.

451
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,809
There is no tomorrow for her.

452
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:38,810
Veekit.

453
00:31:38,967 --> 00:31:40,604
Everyone can make mistakes.

454
00:31:42,154 --> 00:31:44,903
What I hate the most is mistakes.

455
00:31:45,343 --> 00:31:48,063
Especially the mistakes made by people who are contentious like her.

456
00:31:52,432 --> 00:31:53,601
Neeraaumpan.

457
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:02,810
If you fire her,

458
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:05,509
you have to look for a new secretary by yourself.

459
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:10,505
Neeraaumpan.

460
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,404
You did it again, Veekit.

461
00:32:17,493 --> 00:32:18,705
You act out again.

462
00:32:19,497 --> 00:32:20,705
You are too harsh on her.

463
00:32:20,868 --> 00:32:22,407
You realize when it's too late again.

464
00:32:29,854 --> 00:32:31,001
Neeraaumpan.

465
00:32:34,394 --> 00:32:35,410
Neeraaumpan.

466
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,404
Neeraaumpan.

467
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,003
(Having a good memory doesn't mean you will do your job well.)

468
00:32:57,004 --> 00:32:59,172
(All you can do is memorize what you are told?)

469
00:32:59,173 --> 00:33:01,001
(Do you have no other skills?)

470
00:33:01,002 --> 00:33:03,082
(You also need to learn and listen to other people.)

471
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:07,080
Why can't I shake it out of my head?

472
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:10,302
How would I know that?

473
00:33:13,807 --> 00:33:16,503
Mirin, you did make a stupid mistake.

474
00:33:18,856 --> 00:33:22,288
What will I tell Mom and Grandma?

475
00:33:26,685 --> 00:33:27,705
Mirin.

476
00:33:28,733 --> 00:33:29,733
Mirin.

477
00:33:33,771 --> 00:33:34,848
Mirin.

478
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:56,305
I'll drive.

479
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:14,900
That's Tanya, Chanon's friend.

480
00:34:15,001 --> 00:34:16,241
You should smile.

481
00:34:16,242 --> 00:34:17,801
You need to smile more.

482
00:34:19,992 --> 00:34:22,352
Are you looking down on me because of my poor family again?

483
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:24,986
(That's all you think of me.)

484
00:34:45,644 --> 00:34:47,980
Neeraaumpan, what the hell are you doing?

485
00:35:03,733 --> 00:35:05,613
You are Nemesis.

486
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:10,988
You are the best.

487
00:35:10,991 --> 00:35:14,279
You are the sun and the center of the universe.

488
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,122
You are unrivaled and better than anyone.

489
00:35:15,125 --> 00:35:15,985
You have never done anything wrong.

490
00:35:15,986 --> 00:35:18,976
You are perfect from the moment that you were born.

491
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,628
I know that I made a mistake.

492
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:27,106
But didn't he scold me too harshly than the laws allow?

493
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:29,435
Weren't you too harsh on me?

494
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:34,748
From now on,

495
00:35:35,322 --> 00:35:37,720
I use all kinds of poisonous animals to call you.

496
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:39,428
Venomous snake.

497
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:40,849
Three-legged scorpion.

498
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:42,069
Toad of the Amazon.

499
00:35:42,411 --> 00:35:46,705
I'll call all the vicious things with this name.

500
00:35:48,425 --> 00:35:51,311
Veekit!

501
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,807
What?!

502
00:36:23,976 --> 00:36:25,005
Mirin.

503
00:36:35,202 --> 00:36:36,296
Mirin.

504
00:36:39,677 --> 00:36:40,677
Mirin?

505
00:36:45,211 --> 00:36:46,211
Mirin.

506
00:36:49,768 --> 00:36:51,109
Who did you call Mirin?

507
00:36:55,496 --> 00:36:58,816
I'm asking you who you call Mirin.

508
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,850
Directed by Ekkasit Trakulkasemsuk and Pantip Vibultham.

509
00:37:24,151 --> 00:37:25,508
You are good at this.

510
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,509
Can I try it too?

511
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,080
Sure.

512
00:37:34,183 --> 00:37:35,183
Take it.

513
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:40,568
Don't you want to keep it to yourself?

514
00:37:41,539 --> 00:37:42,539
No.

515
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,338
I just share it with you in the same way that you share things with me.

516
00:37:45,362 --> 00:37:46,709
You can give me everything.

517
00:37:47,004 --> 00:37:48,505
I can give you everything as well.

518
00:37:49,613 --> 00:37:51,805
Is there anything you won't give me?

519
00:37:54,087 --> 00:37:55,703
I can't think of one right now.

520
00:37:55,949 --> 00:37:59,005
If one day I have something that I can't give you,

521
00:37:59,271 --> 00:38:00,509
I'll let you know.

522
00:38:03,308 --> 00:38:04,842
How do you play it? Teach me.

523
00:38:07,854 --> 00:38:09,490
You can't take my person.

524
00:38:09,491 --> 00:38:11,321
You need to stop being so self-centered.

525
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:12,810
The world does not revolve around you.

526
00:38:12,834 --> 00:38:15,308
But the world of Next Innovation revolves around me.

527
00:38:15,711 --> 00:38:19,977
The more mistakes Veekit makes, the more you will stand out.

528
00:38:20,582 --> 00:38:23,604
Both Veekit and I didn't mean to make you feel bad.

529
00:38:23,865 --> 00:38:28,365
Your strongest point is that you always find a way to make people like you.

530
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,977
I made this cake to apologize to you.

531
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:33,502
Taste it, Mr. Chanon.

532
00:38:33,899 --> 00:38:34,908
It's really good.

533
00:38:36,361 --> 00:38:37,977
Mr. Veekit hasn't come into the office.

534
00:38:38,444 --> 00:38:41,979
You really don't know where he is?

535
00:38:42,348 --> 00:38:44,629
I rack my brain but I still don't know where he would be.

536
00:38:44,783 --> 00:38:46,506
I think I know a place where he might be.

537
00:38:47,629 --> 00:38:49,109
Are you here?
