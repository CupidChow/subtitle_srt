1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,050
I believe manners are something basic enough that you should know,

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,720
even without a mother to teach you.

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,410
The last time I saw my mother

4
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:11,800
was from over there on the merry-go-round.

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,400
What would you do if you saw your mother again?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,900
You being here on your boss's date is rather like

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,600
when a dog knows its owner is getting a new girlfriend. Don't you think?

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:24,440
You're just an employee.

9
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,400
Alright. That's enough.

10
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,600
I don't want people to look down on you.

11
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:31,650
You didn't see them when they were alone.

12
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,060
I've never seen Veekit like that with anyone.

13
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:35,250
Mirin!

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,050
Mom!

15
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,050
Mom, Mom!

16
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:38,990
Mom, stop!

17
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,760
Mr. Veekit Kraipiwat.

18
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,700
The CEO of Next Innovation.

19
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:47,820
Hello, ma'am.

20
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:49,715
Auntie.

21
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,570
ONE YEAR AFTER NEERAAUMPAN WENT MISSING

22
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:53,300
Mirin.

23
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,600
Su.

24
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,894
(The prominent family is still searching)

25
00:01:09,919 --> 00:01:12,074
(for their missing daughter-in-law.)

26
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,460
They are still looking for you.

27
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,950
Why don't you go get a proper treatment?

28
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:18,900
Your condition may get better.

29
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,900
If you miss your son, you should go back.

30
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,410
The doctor said

31
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,400
my condition will continue to get worse.

32
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,400
In the end, I won't be able to remember anyone

33
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:41,700
even myself.

34
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:48,610
Veekit already has a hard time.

35
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,300
Because he has me as his mother.

36
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,200
Now, I have dementia.

37
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,900
His father was also gone.

38
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,380
He will have a harder time because of me.

39
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,500
This is the best choice for Veekit.

40
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,800
I have a favor to ask you, Su.

41
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,800
Mirin, you too.

42
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,410
Promise me.

43
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,610
You will tell no one about this.

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,890
Jirawat Sutivanichsak

45
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:35,210

Directed by Ekkasit Trakulkasemsuk and Pantip Vibultham

50
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,770
EVERYONE HAS A HIDDEN SIDE

51
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,990
Don't tell me that he is the son...

52
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,710
Shh!

53
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,860
Mom, lower your voice.

54
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,010
This is risky.

55
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,820
Aren't you worried that he will find out?

56
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,450
Mom, trust me.

57
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm trying to find a way out for this.

58
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,530
Can you go with the flow in the meantime?

59
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,700
Mirin, listen to me.

60
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,800
What you are doing,

61
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:16,300
no matter how I look at it, it's just wrong.

62
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,300
There's no way that you can make it right.

63
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,900
If one day he finds out,

64
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,920
You will not be the only one who gets in trouble because of it.

65
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,620
Come on.

66
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,090
You need to help me make a cake.

67
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,500
No.

68
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,810
You need to make a cake for me.

69
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,100
I'll make another cake for someone.

70
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,810
I want you to help me make it.

71
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:47,890
Wait.

72
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,300
I came here to eat the cake that you will make for me.

73
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,500
I didn't come to help you.

74
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,900
Come on.

75
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,880
Baking skills can be useful.

76
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,900
You should learn it.

77
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,000
Auntie.

78
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:21,910
Mirin?

79
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,400
Hello, Auntie.

80
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,180
Mirin.

81
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,800
I'm thinking of you.

82
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,000
I thought you wouldn't come this week.

83
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,310
Why wouldn't I?

84
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,980
I come to visit you every week.

85
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,050
Today, I have a special cake for you.

86
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,140
Here.

87
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,390
Thank you.

88
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,140
What is special about this cake?

89
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,900
This cake is made by Veekit.

90
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,700
Delicious.

91
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,140
It's very delicious.

92
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,740
Did he know?

93
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,130
Did he know that I'm here?

94
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,310
No, he didn't know anything.

95
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,900
My mom and I didn't tell him anything.

96
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:14,400
Yesterday, he came to my house for a cake.

97
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,710
So I asked him to help me make your cake.

98
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,100
But he didn't know that.

99
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,340
So...

100
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,940
How is he doing?

101
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,740
How did you know him?

102
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,530
I...

103
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,210
I have a confession to make.

104
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:46,210
I applied for a job at Next Innovation several times.

105
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,200
But I always failed.

106
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,250
They did not even call me in for an interview.

107
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,700
So I used your name and applied for a job.

108
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:03,690
I made a hot chocolate from your recipe.

109
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:07,300
So he gave me the job.

110
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:13,700
Because Vee misses you.

111
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:27,200
So...

112
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:32,650
How is he doing?

113
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,200
Is he doing well?

114
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,800
Is he a good person?

115
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,510
Are people around him treating him well?

116
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,100
Does he have any chronic diseases?

117
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,000
Does he have the condition I have?

118
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,010
He's doing very well.

119
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:55,100
His grandfather and Chanon are taking good care of him.

120
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,290
About his personality,

121
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:02,100
he is a bit self-centered.

122
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,610
But overall he is a good person.

123
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,700
He has been like that since he was young.

124
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,000
Mirin.

125
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,600
I have a favor to ask you.

126
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:22,000
Can you take lots of photos of him for me?

127
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,810
I want to see him from every angle.

128
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,850
Don't forget to tell him to smile, smile a lot.

129
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,260
Please take a lot of his photos for me.

130
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,090
Sure, Auntie.

131
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,100
I'll do my best.

132
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,890
If there's anything you want me to do for Veekit,

133
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:43,900
please tell me.

134
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,110
You need to eat a lot.

135
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:50,500
This cake is made from Veeket's sweat and arm strength.

136
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,700
This person must be very lucky

137
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,543
to have a chance to eat a cake that I make.

138
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:17,810
Mirin.

139
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,140
What is this?

140
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,740
Oh, Mr. Vee.

141
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,500
You have finished it.

142
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,740
What is this?

143
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,850
This?

144
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,840
It's a clothes iron.

145
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:35,860
A clothes iron?

146
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,170
Do you think I'm stupid?

147
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,650
What is this?

148
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,970
It's an electric egg beater.

149
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:45,700
Huh?

150
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,520
Then why did you tell me to use an egg whisk?

151
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:49,700
Do you want to get fired?

152
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:54,310
Look.

153
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,010
My arm.

154
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,600
My beautiful arm.

155
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,500
If it gets swollen and becomes disfigured, what will I do?

156
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,800
Are you laughing?

157
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,500
No.

158
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,800
Use that. I won't use the egg whisk anymore.

159
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,770
Put the plug in and use it.

160
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,380
Alright, Vee.

161
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,980
You already finished it.

162
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,400
(Finished it? I don't want to do it anymore.)

163
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,980
Who are you?

164
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,780
Whose cake is it?

165
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,180
What are you doing here?

166
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,580
Auntie, it's me, Mirin.

167
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,900
It's me, Mirin. Don't be afraid.

168
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:53,970
This cake is safe.

169
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,200
I made it especially for you.

170
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,500
It's okay.

171
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,810
It's okay.

172
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,740
It's okay, Auntie.

173
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,460
It's me, Mirin.

174
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,100
I'm Mirin.

175
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,500
I've been waiting for a long time.

176
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,470
She will be back soon.

177
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:26,500
Hello, Aunt Noi.

178
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:28,200
Hello.

179
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,080
Today is Sunday.

180
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,970
Why aren't you home?

181
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,050
I've been waiting for you a long time.

182
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:37,100
Why are you waiting for me?

183
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,900
I'm carving brownies.

184
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,640
Go make it for her.

185
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,380
Your mom went out to buy new cookie cutters.

186
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,860
It will take a while before she comes home.

187
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,820
But our shop is closed today.

188
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:50,900
I know.

189
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,700
But my craving doesn't have an off day.

190
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,500
Anyway, I don't trust other shops.

191
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,530
Some of them add weed to brownies.

192
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,480
Some sell sweet brownies though I order low-sugar ones.

193
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:03,650
They are unacceptable.

194
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,900
Can't you make them for me, Mirin?

195
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:06,740
What?

196
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,110
No what. Just go make it for her.

197
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,200
It doesn't take long.

198
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,300
Go.

199
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,300
Yes.

200
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,530
That's it.

201
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,700
Why did she disincline to do it?

202
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:25,480
Nee.

203
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:25,980
Yes.

204
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,040
I heard that Mirin got a job.

205
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:28,670
Yes.

206
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:29,970
What is the name of her company?

207
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:33,200
Her company's name....

208
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:35,970
In...

209
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,420
In...

210
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,000
In...

211
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,410
Inner something.

212
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,010
What kind of company is that?

213
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,800
Is it trustworthy?

214
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:57,730
I want to order 30 boxes of brownies.

215
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,400
Can you deliver them before 9 am this Tuesday?

216
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,800
- Sure. - No.

217
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,600
Sure.

218
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,990
Grandma, you should ask the one who will make them first.

219
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,900
30 boxes by 9 am?

220
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,580
When will we get to sleep if we take the order?

221
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:16,940
Mirin, you will never become rich.

222
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,700
I am your regular customer.

223
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:22,940
I am your major and important customer.

224
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:24,420
Think about it.

225
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,110
I can buy sweets from any shop.

226
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,000
There are hundreds of bakery shops out there.

227
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:31,020
But I chose to buy it from you.

228
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:35,100
You need to do everything to keep customers like me.

229
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:41,400
At least, you should say "Let me see if I can make it in time."

230
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:42,700
That would be better than your answer.

231
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:52,500
Deliver 30 boxes of brownies to me before 9 am this Tuesday.

232
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:54,320
Can you do it?

233
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,410
Yes, I can.

234
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,410
Good.

235
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,140
I'm leaving now, Nee.

236
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:00,850
Yes.

237
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:02,500
Thank you.

238
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,610
How long have you been starving?

239
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:24,960
I'm not starving.

240
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,490
I'm collecting happiness.

241
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:27,700
Huh?

242
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,270
Before I go deal with stress in the meeting room.

243
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,710
It's almost time for the meeting.

244
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:47,600
It's delicious.

245
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:53,940
Oh.

246
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,370
Before we start our meeting,

247
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:04,500
can anyone give me a brief report on the investment in our new application this year?

248
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:13,500
Veekit's new assistant, whom we spent months looking for, screwed that up the other night.

249
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,540
It seems like we have lost a large amount of investment

250
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,940
because of Veekit's secretary.

251
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,610
Who decided to take a trainee to an important event like that?

252
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:27,970
I did.

253
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:32,800
I wanted to know if she was good enough to be my secretary.

254
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,890
That was a mistake.

255
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,570
I apologize to everyone.

256
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,800
I'll make sure that this kind of mistake will never happen again.

257
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,610
About the investment for the new application,

258
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,170
I'll take care of it.

259
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,000
But we don't have much time.

260
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,300
We all should help.

261
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,250
This is too important to let another mistake happen.

262
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,300
Who do you have in mind?

263
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,330
Chanon?

264
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,300
Why?

265
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,400
What's bad about him?

266
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,980
Chanon is well-connected.

267
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,610
Investors are quite confident in his reputation.

268
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,530
What do you think?

269
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,700
I agree with Mr. Sroyphet.

270
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:19,010
I think it's better to have other options.

271
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,660
I will feel better if Chanon also works on it.

272
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,300
It's always better to have many options.

273
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:34,970
We can think later about where we are going to put the investment into.

274
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,060
It doesn't matter who gets the investment.

275
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:42,210
Because the company is benefiting from it anyway.

276
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,420
Yes, Grandpa.

277
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,610
Yes, Granddad.

278
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,810
When someone makes a mistake,

279
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:47,900
We all need to help fix it.

280
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,620
This is our working policy.

281
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:53,010
But it doesn't mean you can make mistakes all the time.

282
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:57,000
I'll ask all of you to work together on this task.

283
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:00,730
I hope that you won't disappoint me.

284
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:27,300
Aew-aes, can you gather a list of potential investors for me?

285
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:28,700
Sure.

286
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,610
I have an investor in mind.

287
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:37,980
I want to do this myself.

288
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,380
Why?

289
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:45,810
Because Veekit doesn't have his mom to help him,

290
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,200
it doesn't mean I shouldn't help you too.

291
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,300
Excuse me.

292
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:58,660
Excuse me.

293
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,580
Goodbye.

294
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:08,810
Wait.

295
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,340
Is your name Neeraaumpan?

296
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:14,930
Yes.

297
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,930
Who gave you the name?

298
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,000
What?

299
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,370
It's a unique name. Don't you think?

300
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,970
You should go gather information about the investors.

301
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,800
So you won't make a mistake this time.

302
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,000
Yes.

303
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,740
It's unlikely that someone would have the same name.

304
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,100
Chanon.

305
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,000
Yes.

306
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:00,800
Can you find the person who gave her that name?

307
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,130
Mom, she is just a secretary.

308
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,500
All these years,

309
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:11,810
I have been looking for a woman named Neeraaumpan but found nothing.

310
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:17,800
I don't believe that she has the same name by chance.

311
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,290
Go look for it.

312
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,600
It's better to know it, isn't it?

313
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,000
It's the name of my mom's close friend.

314
00:21:51,328 --> 00:21:52,505
Mr. Vee.

315
00:21:54,118 --> 00:21:55,339
Are you okay?

316
00:21:56,225 --> 00:21:57,740
You look stressed.

317
00:21:58,779 --> 00:22:00,299
If I was Superman,

318
00:22:01,574 --> 00:22:03,099
Aunt Sroy would be kryptonite.

319
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:08,402
She always has a way to weaken and hurt me.

320
00:22:10,961 --> 00:22:12,539
But that's not what I am stressed about.

321
00:22:15,654 --> 00:22:18,619
It was my fault that you were criticized like that.

322
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:21,567
Even if you didn't exist,

323
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,951
she would talk about my mom like that anyway.

324
00:22:28,521 --> 00:22:30,201
Why don't we find a place to skip work?

325
00:22:30,394 --> 00:22:31,943
Maybe you will feel better.

326
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,607
Sure.

327
00:22:35,653 --> 00:22:37,299
But we are not going to the amusement park.

328
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:39,217
Where are we going?

329
00:22:40,834 --> 00:22:46,302
We are going to look for Big Noi, the Dragon Emperor of Investment.

330
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:49,407
The Dragon Emperor of Investment?

331
00:22:49,488 --> 00:22:54,062
I heard about this legendary investor.

332
00:22:54,994 --> 00:23:00,217
He is talented, insightful, visionary, and unparalleled.

333
00:23:00,349 --> 00:23:02,577
No one knows what he looks like.

334
00:23:02,872 --> 00:23:04,404
In the investment market,

335
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,800
Big Noi is one of the most influential persons.

336
00:23:08,287 --> 00:23:10,106
If he gives the nod to a project,

337
00:23:10,314 --> 00:23:12,802
that project will be soaring through the sky.

338
00:23:14,128 --> 00:23:16,020
Where can we find him?

339
00:23:16,848 --> 00:23:22,122
The most reliable clue only said he loves nature.

340
00:23:22,488 --> 00:23:24,122
He loves nature?

341
00:23:24,942 --> 00:23:27,579
Hurry and go gather all the information as soon as possible, okay?

342
00:23:28,845 --> 00:23:29,974
Okay.

343
00:23:30,127 --> 00:23:31,183
He loves nature.

344
00:23:31,626 --> 00:23:32,580
Sure.

345
00:23:32,718 --> 00:23:33,260
Hey..

346
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,577
I mean you will do that in the car.

347
00:23:36,662 --> 00:23:38,894
We have to go somewhere.

348
00:23:38,906 --> 00:23:40,008
Okay? Let's go.

349
00:23:44,761 --> 00:23:45,906
Where are you going?

350
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:48,905
We are skipping work.

351
00:23:50,675 --> 00:23:51,420
Huh?

352
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:54,798
I'm going to a peaceful place

353
00:23:54,823 --> 00:23:57,025
to create an investment plan to compete with yours.

354
00:23:59,331 --> 00:24:00,509
Whatever you do,

355
00:24:00,885 --> 00:24:03,780
be aware that all eyes are on you

356
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:08,205
A boss and a secretary shouldn't be holding hands.

357
00:24:09,422 --> 00:24:10,897
From your tone of voice,

358
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,299
you sound upset.

359
00:24:16,216 --> 00:24:17,379
Why don't you stop me?

360
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:18,577
But...

361
00:24:20,674 --> 00:24:21,702
It's okay.

362
00:24:22,097 --> 00:24:23,263
I understand.

363
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,309
I guess she likes my hand.

364
00:24:27,859 --> 00:24:29,182
I'm rooting for you

365
00:24:30,911 --> 00:24:32,106
on everything.

366
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:35,177
I'll do my best to compete with you.

367
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:41,416
Don't worry.

368
00:24:42,136 --> 00:24:43,900
I'll give my all as well.

369
00:24:52,663 --> 00:24:53,859
Love nature?

370
00:24:53,957 --> 00:24:55,859
This is too broad.

371
00:24:55,871 --> 00:24:59,105
Big Noi could be at Sai Yok Waterfall.

372
00:24:59,765 --> 00:25:03,543
He loves nature, thought-provoking ideas, and competitions.

373
00:25:03,939 --> 00:25:06,401
Only few people have met him.

374
00:25:07,223 --> 00:25:09,210
It will be hard to identify him.

375
00:25:09,668 --> 00:25:10,930
He doesn't like being photographed.

376
00:25:10,946 --> 00:25:12,210
He doesn't use any social media.

377
00:25:12,441 --> 00:25:13,707
He is like a mysterious dragon

378
00:25:13,732 --> 00:25:15,686
that will appear only in front of the chosen one.

379
00:25:17,213 --> 00:25:19,619
How can we find him?

380
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:22,462
I am the chosen one.

381
00:25:23,598 --> 00:25:28,108
Oh, that's right.

382
00:25:35,056 --> 00:25:37,091
According to the information I got,

383
00:25:37,105 --> 00:25:40,413
he is loud, outspoken, and a bit domineering.

384
00:25:40,737 --> 00:25:43,460
That's the typical elderly.

385
00:25:44,201 --> 00:25:47,607
How can we know that it's him?

386
00:25:49,522 --> 00:25:51,416
If I am the chosen one,

387
00:25:52,059 --> 00:25:54,111
luck will guide us.

388
00:25:54,859 --> 00:25:56,110
Hurry up.

389
00:25:57,179 --> 00:25:58,183
Let's go watch Noi.

390
00:25:59,165 --> 00:26:01,207
He is about to put an end to the game.

391
00:26:01,232 --> 00:26:01,976
Let's go.

392
00:26:07,474 --> 00:26:08,540
See?

393
00:26:15,108 --> 00:26:16,226
I'll kill it too.

394
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,407
Checkmate.

395
00:26:22,623 --> 00:26:24,773
(The Dragon Emperor of Investment.)

396
00:26:25,924 --> 00:26:28,007
(He is talented and insightful.)

397
00:26:28,478 --> 00:26:29,613
Checkmate.

398
00:26:31,165 --> 00:26:32,509
I told you.

399
00:26:34,054 --> 00:26:35,007
Hey, you.

400
00:26:35,537 --> 00:26:38,008
Do you think how Uncle Noi looks?

401
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,417
He looks smart.

402
00:26:42,764 --> 00:26:44,417
He seems to be an expert.

403
00:26:44,722 --> 00:26:46,542
When he squints his eyes,

404
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:48,859
he looks intimidating.

405
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,317
Move.

406
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,980
Next person.

407
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:53,594
Excuse me.

408
00:26:58,525 --> 00:26:59,577
Hello.

409
00:27:02,082 --> 00:27:04,137
Whatever you want from me,

410
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:06,103
I don't have time for that.

411
00:27:09,136 --> 00:27:10,075
I'm leaving.

412
00:27:10,471 --> 00:27:11,709
Wait.

413
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:14,911
I didn't come here to play chess.

414
00:27:18,574 --> 00:27:22,509
But I'm here to ask you to do something greater than that.

415
00:27:24,438 --> 00:27:26,007
No, I'm not interested.

416
00:27:33,669 --> 00:27:34,776
Uncle.

417
00:27:35,285 --> 00:27:37,259
Uncle, you haven't listened to our proposal.

418
00:27:37,854 --> 00:27:40,017
Why do I need to listen to you?

419
00:27:41,874 --> 00:27:42,928
Wait.

420
00:27:44,013 --> 00:27:44,928
Wait.

421
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:48,551
What we are doing will give you tremendous gains

422
00:27:48,576 --> 00:27:51,924
and profits in the future.

423
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:57,204
Then show me that you are my kind.

424
00:28:13,874 --> 00:28:14,705
Wait here.

425
00:28:15,571 --> 00:28:16,909
I'll take care of it.

426
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,505
This is not what we should be doing.

427
00:28:44,201 --> 00:28:46,020
Chanon probably makes a lot of progress.

428
00:28:58,794 --> 00:28:59,779
What?

429
00:29:00,102 --> 00:29:00,899
(Are you busy?)

430
00:29:00,915 --> 00:29:01,903
(Let's go grab coffee with me.)

431
00:29:02,573 --> 00:29:03,958
This is strange.

432
00:29:04,583 --> 00:29:05,605
What's going on?

433
00:29:06,302 --> 00:29:08,303
(Come to meet me. Then I'll tell you.)

434
00:29:08,897 --> 00:29:11,508
I am test driving a new car for my dad's company.

435
00:29:12,318 --> 00:29:13,706
But I can go meet you.

436
00:29:13,964 --> 00:29:15,817
See you in 30 minutes.

437
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:27,980
Please tell my dad that in my opinion,

438
00:29:27,992 --> 00:29:29,351
I like this car the most

439
00:29:29,376 --> 00:29:31,231
among all the automotive brands we have ever worked with.

440
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:32,330
Please tell him that.

441
00:29:33,537 --> 00:29:35,300
Why did you suddenly ask me to meet you?

442
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,613
I want to invite you to invest in Next Innovation.

443
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:52,137
Your mom has talked to me about it.

444
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:55,007
Do you have anything more interesting than the profits to offer?

445
00:29:55,869 --> 00:30:00,299
You know that I have money more than I could use.

446
00:30:01,131 --> 00:30:01,820
Yes.

447
00:30:04,355 --> 00:30:06,380
You will be able to get close to Veekit.

448
00:30:08,108 --> 00:30:08,922
Wait.

449
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,005
This is something that money can't buy.

450
00:30:17,223 --> 00:30:22,619
When working closely with him, he may view you in a more positive light.

451
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,808
That sounds interesting.

452
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:31,660
Is his attitude towards me really going to change?

453
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,008
I'll do my best to help you.

454
00:30:36,663 --> 00:30:38,056
if you help me.

455
00:30:38,408 --> 00:30:42,860
Are you doing this to help me or for yourself?

456
00:30:44,813 --> 00:30:48,503
Who is the real you?

457
00:30:50,059 --> 00:30:54,780
Chanon, a sweet big brother who loves his cousin dearly

458
00:30:55,310 --> 00:31:01,305
or Chanon who only cares about his personal gain?

459
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:11,660
He is my cousin.

460
00:31:12,645 --> 00:31:14,502
But that has nothing to do with our work.

461
00:31:15,826 --> 00:31:18,020
What I need to do for myself,

462
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,708
I will do it.

463
00:31:22,862 --> 00:31:25,205
One day, everyone will see

464
00:31:26,053 --> 00:31:28,260
that I can do better than Veekit.

465
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:37,019
Mr. Vee, are you alright?

466
00:31:39,583 --> 00:31:41,145
Okay.

467
00:31:43,282 --> 00:31:44,509
Are you okay?

468
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:47,100
You did well.

469
00:31:52,568 --> 00:31:54,017
You won over me.

470
00:31:54,853 --> 00:31:57,699
Tell me what deal you have to offer.

471
00:31:59,161 --> 00:31:59,899
We...

472
00:31:59,908 --> 00:32:01,602
I have to tell you this.

473
00:32:01,925 --> 00:32:04,379
I have bought insurance plans from almost every company.

474
00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:05,302
What?

475
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,216
Huh?

476
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:10,340
Aren't you going to sell me an insurance plan?

477
00:32:10,748 --> 00:32:12,567
I agree to talk to you

478
00:32:12,576 --> 00:32:14,717
because this young man is the most dedicated

479
00:32:14,742 --> 00:32:17,483
among all the insurance brokers I've met.

480
00:32:18,654 --> 00:32:21,028
No, we are not selling insurance plans.

481
00:32:21,035 --> 00:32:23,508
We want to ask you to invest in our company.

482
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:25,007
It's the same thing.

483
00:32:25,013 --> 00:32:26,576
You want me to buy your insurance plan.

484
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,977
You don't need to sugarcoat it.

485
00:32:29,725 --> 00:32:30,665
Wait.

486
00:32:30,677 --> 00:32:33,980
We want you to invest in our application.

487
00:32:34,103 --> 00:32:35,422
So we can become a unicorn together.

488
00:32:35,435 --> 00:32:37,342
What? I don't get what you are saying.

489
00:32:39,342 --> 00:32:40,401
Wait.

490
00:32:43,358 --> 00:32:47,405
Uncle Noi, is 'Big Noi' your nickname?

491
00:32:48,293 --> 00:32:49,109
Huh?

492
00:32:50,373 --> 00:32:52,579
I'm Uncle Noi of Soi Pak Sot.

493
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,579
What is this?

494
00:32:56,546 --> 00:32:58,037
It's okay, Mr. Vee.

495
00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:58,786
It's okay.

496
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:00,939
I'll find more information tonight.

497
00:33:01,087 --> 00:33:03,337
Are you going to sell an insurance plan to me?

498
00:33:08,265 --> 00:33:09,577
Hello, Mink.

499
00:33:10,091 --> 00:33:14,031
I called you to ask about an investor named Big Noi.

500
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:15,700
Do you know him?

501
00:33:16,059 --> 00:33:16,900
Really?

502
00:33:17,352 --> 00:33:18,306
Sure.

503
00:33:18,877 --> 00:33:20,711
Thank you so much.

504
00:33:21,783 --> 00:33:22,339
Alright.

505
00:33:22,346 --> 00:33:23,503
Thank you.

506
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,558
14 YEARS AGO

507
00:33:27,558 --> 00:33:27,730
Sure. 14 YEARS AGO

508
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:28,306
Sure.

509
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,306
Thank you for your advice.

510
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,906
It's very useful to me.

511
00:33:32,438 --> 00:33:33,306
You're welcome.

512
00:33:33,607 --> 00:33:35,306
Excuse me.

513
00:33:43,878 --> 00:33:45,601
Veekit, come here.

514
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:47,903
Yes, Granddad.

515
00:33:50,042 --> 00:33:52,300
The person standing over there.

516
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,161
Remember his face.

517
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:55,811
His nickname is Big Noi.

518
00:33:56,091 --> 00:33:59,457
He is a visionary investor.

519
00:34:00,226 --> 00:34:03,060
I hope that many investors in our country are talented like him.

520
00:34:04,832 --> 00:34:06,005
Granddad.

521
00:34:06,915 --> 00:34:08,659
Did you forget?

522
00:34:09,773 --> 00:34:11,920
I can't see people's faces.

523
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,880
Mr. Vee.

524
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,001
I asked my friend who is working overseas.

525
00:34:25,014 --> 00:34:27,311
She confirmed that Big Noi is a real person.

526
00:34:27,551 --> 00:34:30,654
But during the past two years, he has been keeping a low profile.

527
00:34:30,666 --> 00:34:34,022
Because he is bored and doesn't enjoy investment anymore.

528
00:34:36,143 --> 00:34:37,804
I think I should hire a private investigator.

529
00:34:38,182 --> 00:34:39,613
We don't have much time.

530
00:34:39,758 --> 00:34:42,340
If we keep guessing, we will never find him.

531
00:34:44,305 --> 00:34:47,940
Aren't we supposed to look for other investors?

532
00:34:48,374 --> 00:34:51,142
If we can't find Big Noi, what will we do?

533
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:52,742
I always get what I want.

534
00:34:54,105 --> 00:34:55,903
I'm not going to come up with a plan B.

535
00:34:56,143 --> 00:34:59,937
If I don't get the investor that I want, I want no one else.

536
00:35:01,386 --> 00:35:03,579
The only one that I want is Big Noi.

537
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:10,814
(Hello.)

538
00:35:11,087 --> 00:35:11,896
Hello.

539
00:35:12,324 --> 00:35:13,908
(Why are you video calling me?)

540
00:35:14,894 --> 00:35:16,111
I'm going to wash my face.

541
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,607
I have no hands to hold the phone.

542
00:35:18,404 --> 00:35:20,977
How is your business plan going?

543
00:35:21,318 --> 00:35:22,908
I just closed the deal with you the other day.

544
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,008
(I couldn't magically come up with one now.)

545
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:28,909
Why are you taking your shirt off?

546
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,777
Why do you make a big deal out of it?

547
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,309
(I am a woman.)

548
00:35:33,453 --> 00:35:35,709
(You can't go topless in front of me.)

549
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,608
(Have you ever thought how I would feel?)

550
00:35:37,748 --> 00:35:38,717
Calm down.

551
00:35:39,145 --> 00:35:42,305
(We are just business partners.)

552
00:35:43,168 --> 00:35:46,179
(I know you have no feelings for me.)

553
00:35:46,583 --> 00:35:48,909
Because we are business partners,

554
00:35:48,921 --> 00:35:50,604
You need to be more considerate of me.

555
00:35:51,837 --> 00:35:55,402
Get your plan ready before I change my mind about the investment.

556
00:35:56,128 --> 00:35:56,979
(Sure.)

557
00:36:25,632 --> 00:36:26,860
Morning, Mom.

558
00:36:31,288 --> 00:36:32,208
Non.

559
00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:35,490
How many times I've told you to sit down and have your meal properly?

560
00:36:36,198 --> 00:36:37,308
I can't do it today.

561
00:36:37,383 --> 00:36:39,579
I need to hurry to prepare my business plan.

562
00:36:40,465 --> 00:36:42,109
Did you have an investor?

563
00:36:42,426 --> 00:36:43,314
Tanya.

564
00:36:44,642 --> 00:36:46,337
It's the same person I had in mind.

565
00:36:46,585 --> 00:36:48,407
You always do what I want.

566
00:36:48,903 --> 00:36:49,942
I have to go now.

567
00:36:57,062 --> 00:37:00,102
Mrs. Sroy, the person you asked to meet is here.

568
00:37:01,168 --> 00:37:02,500
Tell him to come in.

569
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:09,204
Hello, Mrs. Sroyphet.

570
00:37:14,216 --> 00:37:16,497
Get me information about Veekit's new secretary.

571
00:37:17,082 --> 00:37:18,509
I want to know everything about her.

572
00:37:19,148 --> 00:37:21,195
Her education, background,

573
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:24,338
financial status, family, parents and relatives.

574
00:37:24,728 --> 00:37:26,148
Everything about her past and present.

575
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,183
Get me everything.

576
00:37:27,204 --> 00:37:27,914
This is urgent.

577
00:37:28,117 --> 00:37:28,940
Yes.

578
00:37:29,805 --> 00:37:31,506
What I want to know the most

579
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:38,499
is who gave her the name, Neeraaumpan.

580
00:37:52,025 --> 00:37:54,259
Aunt Noi, I'm here.

581
00:38:07,697 --> 00:38:09,256
Hello, Aunt Noi.

582
00:38:09,725 --> 00:38:11,659
Now is 9.02 am.

583
00:38:13,623 --> 00:38:15,217
I thought you would arrive on time.

584
00:38:17,217 --> 00:38:18,314
I'm sorry.

585
00:38:18,324 --> 00:38:21,219
Taking a turn took more time than I thought.

586
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:23,300
Where should I put the brownies?

587
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,502
My ride would be here soon.

588
00:38:24,903 --> 00:38:26,105
Wait a second.

589
00:38:30,442 --> 00:38:31,540
Don't forget to count it.

590
00:38:36,074 --> 00:38:37,539
I won't give you the change. Think of it as my tip.

591
00:38:46,216 --> 00:38:47,080
Shall we go now?

592
00:38:47,093 --> 00:38:48,260
I'm worried that we may miss the flight.

593
00:38:48,811 --> 00:38:49,460
Yes.

594
00:38:49,914 --> 00:38:54,308
After giving me a ride, you take the brownies to the healthcare center.

595
00:38:54,368 --> 00:38:58,060
Tell the supervisor that everyone can eat them.

596
00:38:58,088 --> 00:38:59,728
The brownies are low-sugar and safe.

597
00:38:59,748 --> 00:39:00,462
Yes.

598
00:39:03,897 --> 00:39:06,702
Give the brownies to him

599
00:39:06,859 --> 00:39:08,702
Why are you acting dumb?

600
00:39:09,671 --> 00:39:10,383
Yes.

601
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:13,905
Here.

602
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:21,222
I picked up Big Noi. We are leaving for the airport.

603
00:39:30,062 --> 00:39:32,208
Aunt Noi is Big Noi!

604
00:39:33,659 --> 00:39:34,804
Aunt Noi.

605
00:39:35,091 --> 00:39:36,380
Big Noi.

606
00:39:38,437 --> 00:39:39,404
Big Noi.

607
00:39:39,576 --> 00:39:40,517
Aunt Noi.

608
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,060
Sure.

609
00:39:50,081 --> 00:39:51,771
Thank you for your advice.

610
00:39:51,785 --> 00:39:53,106
It's very useful to me.

611
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,779
You're welcome.

612
00:39:57,961 --> 00:39:58,660
What?

613
00:40:00,077 --> 00:40:02,303
Are you Big Noi?

614
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:04,005
Why?

615
00:40:04,294 --> 00:40:06,176
If I were Big Noi, what would you do?

616
00:40:07,928 --> 00:40:08,902
I...

617
00:40:09,205 --> 00:40:10,514
The company that I am working for.

618
00:40:10,531 --> 00:40:14,262
Though my boss is a bit strange, he is very hardworking.

619
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:17,207
He is looking for investment for our new application.

620
00:40:18,081 --> 00:40:19,306
You are wasting my time.

621
00:40:19,802 --> 00:40:20,604
Let's go.

622
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:24,192
Aunt Noi.

623
00:40:25,216 --> 00:40:26,177
Aunt Noi.

624
00:40:26,496 --> 00:40:27,202
Aunt Noi.

625
00:40:27,219 --> 00:40:28,549
It's a health application

626
00:40:28,561 --> 00:40:30,706
for those who are living alone and want to take care of their health.

627
00:40:30,725 --> 00:40:31,748
It can calculate the calories of your meal

628
00:40:31,773 --> 00:40:33,712
and measure your blood pressure, blood sugar, and heart rate.

629
00:40:33,725 --> 00:40:35,448
You can set up an alarm to remind you to take your medicine.

630
00:40:35,457 --> 00:40:37,502
It has everything that health apps should have.

631
00:40:37,514 --> 00:40:39,091
It's really good for your health.

632
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,934
Aunt Noi, could you at least hear me out?

633
00:40:46,786 --> 00:40:47,828
Aunt Noi.

634
00:40:53,277 --> 00:40:56,410
Tell your boss to come and meet me in two days.

635
00:40:56,739 --> 00:40:58,262
I'll give him 15 minutes.

636
00:40:59,288 --> 00:41:00,262
Sure.

637
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:01,863
I won't disappoint you.

638
00:41:03,254 --> 00:41:03,912
Go.

639
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:06,179
Thank you, Aunt Noi.

640
00:41:09,681 --> 00:41:10,893
Yeah.

641
00:41:12,017 --> 00:41:14,607
Aunt Noi is Big Noi.

642
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,506
What?

643
00:41:15,644 --> 00:41:16,814
You found Big Noi.

644
00:41:16,976 --> 00:41:20,156
Aunt Noi who has been nagging me since I was young

645
00:41:20,181 --> 00:41:21,929
is the legendary Big Noi.

646
00:41:22,122 --> 00:41:24,499
We found the real Big Noi.

647
00:41:25,091 --> 00:41:26,502
How can you be sure?

648
00:41:27,162 --> 00:41:27,911
Here.

649
00:41:28,663 --> 00:41:30,422
I did some research.

650
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:32,102
Aunt Noi or Nilchinda was the CEO

651
00:41:32,127 --> 00:41:35,017
of a leading international financial company.

652
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:37,337
She came back to Thailand and became an investor.

653
00:41:37,383 --> 00:41:38,936
She started her investment with only ten million baht.

654
00:41:38,943 --> 00:41:40,515
She became well-known as Big Noi.

655
00:41:40,841 --> 00:41:42,902
If you look at all the major investment movements in Thailand,

656
00:41:42,909 --> 00:41:45,697
you will see that she was always a part of them.

657
00:41:46,985 --> 00:41:48,327
When can we meet her?

658
00:41:49,416 --> 00:41:50,499
In two days.

659
00:41:50,598 --> 00:41:52,414
She wants to see our detailed business plan

660
00:41:52,429 --> 00:41:55,057
and a box of low-sugar brownies.

661
00:41:55,924 --> 00:41:56,706
Okay.

662
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,410
Tonight, you need to come to sleep with me.

663
00:41:59,114 --> 00:42:00,582
Are you crazy?

664
00:42:01,179 --> 00:42:02,708
You, pervert.

665
00:42:04,317 --> 00:42:05,380
What are you thinking?

666
00:42:06,001 --> 00:42:08,979
We have only two days to work on all the data.

667
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:10,508
If you do not come to stay with me,

668
00:42:10,515 --> 00:42:11,725
how can we finish it?

669
00:42:15,745 --> 00:42:19,662
We will create a perfect and flawless business plan.

670
00:42:20,352 --> 00:42:21,413
Roger that.

671
00:42:23,644 --> 00:42:25,487
If you got it, then go make me a hot chocolate.

672
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,306
Hurry up.

673
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:28,017
Yes.

674
00:42:35,379 --> 00:42:37,010
Mirin, you are getting better.

675
00:42:37,293 --> 00:42:38,820
You are also lucky.

676
00:42:38,968 --> 00:42:41,984
I never thought that Aunt Noi, the demanding Karen,

677
00:42:42,009 --> 00:42:44,246
would become an MVP in this game.

678
00:42:44,731 --> 00:42:48,005
Now, Veekit won't be in trouble because of me anymore.

679
00:42:48,466 --> 00:42:50,605
If Big Noi helps us,

680
00:42:50,782 --> 00:42:54,314
Veekit will have a little room to breathe.

681
00:42:55,605 --> 00:42:56,520
Go for it.

682
00:43:00,048 --> 00:43:01,897
Does Big Noi really exist?

683
00:43:03,056 --> 00:43:04,702
Did Veekit find a way to contact him?

684
00:43:14,137 --> 00:43:16,825
You are getting better every day, Honeybun.

2 YEARS AFTER NEERAAUMPAN WENT MISSING

687
00:43:26,201 --> 00:43:28,810
It has been two years since Neeraaumpan went missing.

688
00:43:29,822 --> 00:43:32,605
But she should no longer have any influence in your life.

689
00:43:32,802 --> 00:43:33,802
Of course, she has.

690
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:35,405
She is Veekit's mother.

691
00:43:36,028 --> 00:43:38,179
If she really went missing,

692
00:43:38,925 --> 00:43:41,309
Veekit will have no one but me.

693
00:43:42,164 --> 00:43:46,105
I want to be sure that Veekit will have no one by his side.

694
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:52,859
How can I believe you that you are feeling shy?

695
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:54,419
Can't you tell by looking at me?

696
00:43:56,357 --> 00:43:58,257
If I can see how you smile,

697
00:43:59,091 --> 00:44:00,404
it would be great.

698
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,059
If he could see my smile?

699
00:44:04,407 --> 00:44:06,398
Do they really believe they have Big Noi on board?

700
00:44:06,405 --> 00:44:08,776
When your grandpa calls for a meeting,

701
00:44:08,785 --> 00:44:10,231
people will be laughing at them.

702
00:44:10,242 --> 00:44:13,770
We are going to create an app for those who need caregiving.

703
00:44:13,782 --> 00:44:16,759
How will a young man like you understand what sick people

704
00:44:16,784 --> 00:44:18,342
and the elderly want?

705
00:44:18,725 --> 00:44:19,299
Aunt Noi.

706
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:20,977
I also have a disorder.

707
00:44:21,029 --> 00:44:23,380
I have face blindness.

708
00:44:24,325 --> 00:44:26,469
If I don't use a click sound like this,

709
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,576
how will you know that you should smile?

710
00:44:30,983 --> 00:44:34,407
If I got used to having you with me and one day, you were gone,

711
00:44:35,011 --> 00:44:36,005
what would I do?

712
00:44:36,303 --> 00:44:38,005
You can't leave me.
