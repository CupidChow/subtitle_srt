1
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,908
Wow!

2
00:00:26,535 --> 00:00:27,869
When you get on the ride,

3
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,858
hold on steadily so you don't fall off, alright?

4
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,411
Yes, Mom.

5
00:00:31,412 --> 00:00:33,503
I promise to be careful.

6
00:00:33,865 --> 00:00:35,503
Wait for me for a minute, Mom.

7
00:00:35,761 --> 00:00:36,910
Only a minute.

8
00:00:39,236 --> 00:00:40,027
Alright, hon.

9
00:00:40,027 --> 00:00:40,985
I'll be fine.

10
00:00:40,985 --> 00:00:41,800
You go on.

11
00:00:41,926 --> 00:00:43,212
I'll wait right here.

12
00:00:43,355 --> 00:00:44,355
Yes, Mom.

13
00:00:56,227 --> 00:00:57,408
Hi, Mom!

14
00:01:08,624 --> 00:01:10,378
Mom, it's so much fun.

15
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:19,416
Mom?

16
00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:21,259
Mom?

17
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:24,879
Mom!

18
00:01:25,144 --> 00:01:26,144
Mom!

19
00:01:26,223 --> 00:01:27,510
I don't want to play anymore.

20
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,135
Mom!

21
00:01:29,136 --> 00:01:30,691
Mom! Mom!

22
00:01:31,778 --> 00:01:32,778
Mom!

23
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:34,193
Mom!

24
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:36,796
Mom!

25
00:01:37,518 --> 00:01:38,518
Mom!

26
00:01:38,985 --> 00:01:39,985
Mom!

27
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,153
Mom!

28
00:01:41,154 --> 00:01:43,939
- Are any of you this boy's mother? - Mom? Where are you?

29
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,939
Are you his mother?

30
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,142
Mom...

31
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,365
Is this your mother, boy?

32
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,520
- Mom! Mom! - Or this?

33
00:01:53,996 --> 00:01:55,861
Are any of you this boy's mother?

34
00:01:55,862 --> 00:01:58,108
Mom!

35
00:02:00,108 --> 00:02:01,992
Oh, no. Hey! Hey!

36
00:02:02,303 --> 00:02:03,303
Boy!

37
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,680
Hey!

38
00:02:05,452 --> 00:02:06,608
Hey!

39
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,730
Jirawat Sutivanichsak.

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,050
Supassara Thanachart.

41
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:39,330
Ishikawa Plowden.

42
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,930
Phatchatorn Thanawat / Wanwimol Jaenasavamethee.

43
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:50,290
Phanuroj Chalermkijporntavee / Chayakorn Jutamas.

44
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,610
Directed by Ekkasit Trakulkasemsuk and Pantip Vibultham.

45
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,610
NEERAAUMPAN

46
00:03:46,261 --> 00:03:47,406
Look straight, please.

47
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:48,922
Alright.

48
00:03:48,923 --> 00:03:50,262
That's it. We're done.

49
00:03:53,735 --> 00:03:55,181
Is anything wrong with my grandson?

50
00:03:55,337 --> 00:03:58,611
Physically, everything's normal.

51
00:03:59,008 --> 00:04:03,263
His condition likely stems from a mental cause.

52
00:04:03,363 --> 00:04:04,104
Mom!

53
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,507
I would say the patient has what is called prosopagnosia,

54
00:04:08,993 --> 00:04:10,807
or known commonly as "face blindness"

55
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,400
where patients can't distinguish faces.

56
00:04:13,808 --> 00:04:17,009
It's either a result of some malfunction in the brain,

57
00:04:17,628 --> 00:04:21,106
or it could be because of extreme emotional distress.

58
00:04:21,436 --> 00:04:24,258
Did something that might have a great impact

59
00:04:24,552 --> 00:04:27,107
on the patient mentally happen recently?

60
00:04:27,571 --> 00:04:31,207
I think it could be the disappearance of Neeraaumpan, his mother.

61
00:04:55,876 --> 00:04:57,800
Good morning, Mr. Veekit.

62
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,376
Good morning, Mr. Veekit.

63
00:05:09,753 --> 00:05:13,314
'Morning... Nittaya from HR.

64
00:05:13,538 --> 00:05:16,906
Here's the list of all the new recruits in our IT department.

65
00:05:16,907 --> 00:05:19,533
I'll have them introduce themselves to you in your office right away.

66
00:05:19,557 --> 00:05:22,256
Do that after I have my first cup of hot chocolate.

67
00:05:45,148 --> 00:05:46,148
Non.

68
00:05:47,024 --> 00:05:51,406
I believe there should be a cup of hot chocolate on my desk right about now.

69
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:52,910
(There should.)

70
00:05:53,476 --> 00:05:56,285
(But only after you finally select your new secretary.)

71
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:59,230
Now zip it and make your own hot chocolate until then.

72
00:05:59,447 --> 00:06:00,659
I'll see you later.

73
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:26,779
Chanon.

74
00:06:27,427 --> 00:06:29,307
Don't tell me you pulled an all-nighter again.

75
00:06:31,622 --> 00:06:32,622
Just a bit, Mom.

76
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,905
Just a bit?

77
00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:38,809
I doubt it's "just a bit" at this point.

78
00:06:39,138 --> 00:06:41,803
Is your Mr. CEO going to do nothing at all?

79
00:06:41,882 --> 00:06:44,940
Does Veekit plan to make you do all the work?

80
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,142
I'm not going to take that sitting down, you know?

81
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:48,166
Come on now.

82
00:06:49,118 --> 00:06:52,390
I think I might finally find Vee a new secretary today.

83
00:06:52,956 --> 00:06:55,305
I have to, in any case. We're running out of candidates.

84
00:06:55,877 --> 00:06:56,877
Truly.

85
00:06:57,184 --> 00:06:58,661
He's such a picky boy.

86
00:06:58,662 --> 00:07:00,628
Nobody is ever good enough for him.

87
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,178
And it all comes down to you.

88
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:05,379
I'd love for your grandfather to see him like this.

89
00:07:05,683 --> 00:07:09,381
Grandpa needs to stop putting his golden boy on such a pedestal.

90
00:07:13,352 --> 00:07:16,359
Even I don't complain as much as you do, Mrs. Sroyphet.

91
00:07:20,332 --> 00:07:22,209
You worry too much.

92
00:07:24,821 --> 00:07:26,421
But I guess that's how much you love me.

93
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:29,808
Of course I love you.

94
00:07:30,403 --> 00:07:32,499
I don't want anyone to take advantage of you.

95
00:07:33,046 --> 00:07:34,046
Listen.

96
00:07:34,492 --> 00:07:37,218
Stop devoting all your time for Veekit, Non.

97
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,302
Put yourself first sometimes, you hear me?

98
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,400
Yes, Mom.

99
00:07:42,455 --> 00:07:46,804
But after I find him the genius he wants for a secretary.

100
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:48,321
Alright?

101
00:07:48,322 --> 00:07:49,962
I'll let him fend for himself after that.

102
00:07:50,508 --> 00:07:51,508
Promise.

103
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:56,937
I'm going to take a shower.

104
00:07:57,085 --> 00:07:58,309
As you should.

105
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:24,099
Non, get cleaned up quickly and come down for breakfast.

106
00:08:26,063 --> 00:08:27,219
Thank you for this, Mom.

107
00:08:28,831 --> 00:08:30,058
And for this.

108
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,102
Wash your face.

109
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,073
Three brownies and two yogurt for Si.

110
00:09:06,074 --> 00:09:07,978
Last house on the first street, on the left.

111
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,550
Thank you.

112
00:09:11,689 --> 00:09:14,380
Two orange juice and one cookie for Jaidee.

113
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:16,429
The house with the green fence on the third street.

114
00:09:17,996 --> 00:09:19,106
Now for Joy.

115
00:09:19,421 --> 00:09:23,020
Two low-sugar butter cakes and two sugar-free banana cakes.

116
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:33,541
Noi!

117
00:09:33,661 --> 00:09:35,541
Your delivery is here!

118
00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:44,433
Noi!

119
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,980
I'm here!

120
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,335
Her name means "minimal," but she sure isn't.

121
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,340
Two small butter cakes.

122
00:09:54,006 --> 00:09:57,039
Use stevia instead of sugar, per some random recipe she found on Facebook.

123
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,706
Two boxes of brownies, "and prove there's no weed in it," she requested.

124
00:10:01,689 --> 00:10:02,902
How do I "prove it"?

125
00:10:03,055 --> 00:10:05,575
Does she want me to try it right here and now and not get high?

126
00:10:10,701 --> 00:10:11,743
You're late.

127
00:10:12,007 --> 00:10:13,707
Very late, Mirin.

128
00:10:15,183 --> 00:10:16,910
I'm just fashionably late, Noi.

129
00:10:17,542 --> 00:10:18,542
Here.

130
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:24,915
Try it.

131
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,209
Have you got yourself a job yet?

132
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:00,978
No.

133
00:11:01,678 --> 00:11:02,486
Hold it.

134
00:11:02,487 --> 00:11:03,903
There's nothing in the brownie.

135
00:11:04,727 --> 00:11:07,527
I was just caught off guard because you asked such a pointed question.

136
00:11:09,295 --> 00:11:10,410
What a relief.

137
00:11:12,252 --> 00:11:14,498
Well, you graduated two years ago

138
00:11:14,597 --> 00:11:16,717
and you're still delivering brownies for your mother.

139
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,746
Kids these days are all the same, aren't they?

140
00:11:19,747 --> 00:11:22,248
Don't be so picky with jobs.

141
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:24,104
Just do what you're offered.

142
00:11:24,713 --> 00:11:26,422
Well, what do you do?

143
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:28,507
Why? Why'd you ask?

144
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:30,949
I'm just curious.

145
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,949
Since you seem to have so much free time

146
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,406
to poke your nose into other people's business.

147
00:11:34,407 --> 00:11:35,989
Here's your brownies.

148
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,107
Enjoy.

149
00:11:37,516 --> 00:11:38,516
I'll keep this.

150
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:41,876
Rest assured that the brownie's poison-free.

151
00:11:41,877 --> 00:11:42,901
And even if it isn't,

152
00:11:44,107 --> 00:11:46,467
no poison is strong enough to kill someone like you anyway.

153
00:11:50,452 --> 00:11:52,209
Was that a dig at me?

154
00:11:54,425 --> 00:11:55,425
It's good.

155
00:12:00,073 --> 00:12:01,302
Hey, Su.

156
00:12:01,606 --> 00:12:02,279
Hmm?

157
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,495
You think Rin's going to get the job this time?

158
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,000
Good question, Mom.

159
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,700
I don't know how she keeps missing her shot.

160
00:12:11,046 --> 00:12:12,899
My baby even graduated top of her class!

161
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:14,739
I feel bad for her.

162
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,907
Somehow she keeps getting rejected.

163
00:12:19,225 --> 00:12:20,225
Listen.

164
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:23,306
If she gets turned down again this time around,

165
00:12:23,307 --> 00:12:25,227
I don't want her to try anymore.

166
00:12:25,228 --> 00:12:27,938
Just let her leech off of old people like us.

167
00:12:27,939 --> 00:12:29,515
What's the harm in that?

168
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:31,602
Mom, don't say that.

169
00:12:31,603 --> 00:12:33,017
Rin's an adult now.

170
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:35,109
She needs a job.

171
00:12:35,634 --> 00:12:38,102
It's not like you can keep doing this, Mom.

172
00:12:38,439 --> 00:12:41,406
Your legs are frailing and your back hurts.

173
00:12:41,859 --> 00:12:43,538
Your heart is no longer strong, either.

174
00:12:43,953 --> 00:12:44,953
What?

175
00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:47,609
My heart?

176
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:49,340
Look.

177
00:12:49,758 --> 00:12:54,538
My heart is as good as when I was 30, I'll have you know.

178
00:12:55,382 --> 00:12:56,538
I'm still kicking.

179
00:12:57,575 --> 00:12:58,575
Sure.

180
00:13:15,249 --> 00:13:16,249
Rin.

181
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:17,601
Rin.

182
00:13:17,602 --> 00:13:18,898
- Coming. - It's me.

183
00:13:19,168 --> 00:13:20,416
Yes, Grandma?

184
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:29,207
You have an interview today, don't you?

185
00:13:30,395 --> 00:13:35,501
I was at the market the other day and saw a dress I thought you might like.

186
00:13:36,163 --> 00:13:38,259
You haven't gone shopping for a while now, have you?

187
00:13:38,425 --> 00:13:41,287
Wear this one. You'll look great.

188
00:13:43,883 --> 00:13:44,883
Here.

189
00:13:46,566 --> 00:13:47,566
Look.

190
00:13:48,597 --> 00:13:49,642
Grandma.

191
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,032
Look, look.

192
00:13:51,033 --> 00:13:52,888
You shouldn't have spent your money on this.

193
00:13:52,889 --> 00:13:54,620
It's just an interview.

194
00:13:54,893 --> 00:13:56,209
Come on.

195
00:13:56,655 --> 00:13:58,617
It's a pretty dress.

196
00:13:58,762 --> 00:14:03,939
Something like this was all the rage when I was young, you know?

197
00:14:05,675 --> 00:14:10,858
More importantly, I saved up for this dress just for you.

198
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,858
Fine. Let me see.

199
00:14:15,338 --> 00:14:17,139
Is it very expensive?

200
00:14:21,335 --> 00:14:22,857
What's this here?

201
00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:25,015
To fuel your body.

202
00:14:26,212 --> 00:14:30,813
You need to take care of your body so you can keep on going.

203
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,543
Thank you.

204
00:14:36,544 --> 00:14:38,618
I love you so much, Grandma.

205
00:14:42,436 --> 00:14:45,340
I have both your dress and your support.

206
00:14:45,341 --> 00:14:46,940
I have nothing to fear now.

207
00:14:46,941 --> 00:14:49,523
Of course you have nothing to fear, my amazing girl.

208
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:51,005
Isn't that right?

209
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,308
Alright, Mirin.

210
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:12,612
Time to become Neeraaumpan.

211
00:15:30,652 --> 00:15:33,808
The definition isn't... very good...

212
00:15:34,428 --> 00:15:36,620
Excuse me. It's Nok from housekeeping.

213
00:15:41,957 --> 00:15:43,218
Your hot chocolate, sir.

214
00:15:48,316 --> 00:15:49,604
Bugs...

215
00:16:01,213 --> 00:16:02,703
That's not what I asked for.

216
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,270
Take it away.

217
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,218
But I made it exactly the way you instructed, Mr. Vee.

218
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,545
I can tell just by the look of it that it's not the case.

219
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:10,039
But...

220
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,919
Is the interview for my new secretary going to start soon?

221
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,698
Mr. Chanon's secretary said it'll begin in an hour.

222
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:16,375
Tell Mr. Chanon...

223
00:16:17,364 --> 00:16:18,603
Start immediately.

224
00:16:18,742 --> 00:16:20,134
I can't take it anymore.

225
00:16:20,135 --> 00:16:22,540
I need the right kind of hot chocolate!

226
00:16:23,098 --> 00:16:24,107
Right now!

227
00:16:24,849 --> 00:16:25,760
Y-Yes, sir.

228
00:16:25,761 --> 00:16:27,417
Right away, sir.

229
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,840
Grilled pork!

230
00:16:46,848 --> 00:16:48,493
Come get your grilled pork!

231
00:16:48,534 --> 00:16:50,907
Best grilled pork on the block!

232
00:16:51,651 --> 00:16:52,914
Hello? Yes?

233
00:16:54,671 --> 00:16:55,671
What?

234
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:57,507
The interview has been moved up?

235
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,500
Yes. I'll be there right away.

236
00:17:00,582 --> 00:17:02,301
Excuse me! I need a taxi!

237
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,540
Next Office, please.

238
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:19,590
Boss.

239
00:17:19,743 --> 00:17:20,743
Boss!

240
00:17:20,955 --> 00:17:21,992
Yes, Miss Eas?

241
00:17:21,993 --> 00:17:23,446
Mr. Veekit moved the interview up.

242
00:17:23,447 --> 00:17:26,208
He said he couldn't take it anymore and needed a secretary right now.

243
00:17:27,065 --> 00:17:28,819
Are all the candidates here?

244
00:17:29,196 --> 00:17:32,698
Yes, except for one Neeraaumpan.

245
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,240
Neeraaumpan?

246
00:17:36,712 --> 00:17:37,369
Yes.

247
00:17:37,369 --> 00:17:38,369
Here.

248
00:17:47,535 --> 00:17:49,002
Tell Veekit to wait.

249
00:17:49,267 --> 00:17:51,461
But he would be furious.

250
00:17:52,396 --> 00:17:53,189
Trust me.

251
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,458
He'll want to meet this one.

252
00:17:57,097 --> 00:17:58,140
Y-Yes.

253
00:18:05,803 --> 00:18:06,803
Here, sir.

254
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:10,751
And here.

255
00:18:10,751 --> 00:18:11,751
Thank you.

256
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,172
We're waiting for one more candidate.

257
00:18:20,173 --> 00:18:21,310
She should be here soon-

258
00:18:22,944 --> 00:18:23,944
Oh!

259
00:18:25,316 --> 00:18:26,706
Sorry. I'm so sorry!

260
00:18:28,342 --> 00:18:29,342
Sorry.

261
00:18:29,861 --> 00:18:30,803
Really sorry.

262
00:18:30,803 --> 00:18:31,803
Oh!

263
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,283
So it's Miss Vintage Dress here

264
00:19:10,258 --> 00:19:12,179
who has been wasting my time?

265
00:19:19,938 --> 00:19:21,501
I would have been on time

266
00:19:22,633 --> 00:19:25,338
if it wasn't for the sudden change in the schedule.

267
00:19:26,556 --> 00:19:28,339
I'd say it's a convenient change,

268
00:19:29,526 --> 00:19:30,700
rather than "sudden."

269
00:19:31,975 --> 00:19:32,700
But-

270
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,700
She's disqualified.

271
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:36,157
With that dress on, she's totally disqualified.

272
00:19:36,158 --> 00:19:37,158
Vee.

273
00:19:37,254 --> 00:19:38,131
I think you should-

274
00:19:38,132 --> 00:19:40,108
You decided that based on how I dress?

275
00:19:44,335 --> 00:19:45,335
Yeah.

276
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:48,858
What an outdated way of thinking.

277
00:19:50,164 --> 00:19:51,938
Not as outdated as what you're wearing.

278
00:19:52,229 --> 00:19:53,938
You can't just judge me based on that.

279
00:19:54,227 --> 00:19:55,747
I'm much more than what meets the eye.

280
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,800
Are you now?

281
00:19:59,618 --> 00:20:00,709
Then, why don't we start?

282
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,580
I'll let you have a go before anyone else.

283
00:20:04,698 --> 00:20:06,003
How many languages do you speak?

284
00:20:06,484 --> 00:20:07,600
Were you educated abroad?

285
00:20:07,601 --> 00:20:09,026
Where else have you worked before?

286
00:20:09,027 --> 00:20:12,410
Do you have any experiences with applications?

287
00:20:17,461 --> 00:20:18,499
No.

288
00:20:21,639 --> 00:20:27,178
Do you even know what qualifications I need in a secretary?

289
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:29,177
Do you know anything?

290
00:20:29,178 --> 00:20:31,178
Vee, enough.

291
00:20:37,272 --> 00:20:40,019
This is the first company that developed applications seriously.

292
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,004
It started with general applications,

293
00:20:42,615 --> 00:20:45,164
but gained traction and made a breakthrough

294
00:20:45,165 --> 00:20:47,808
after switching to apps focusing on wellness and health.

295
00:20:48,016 --> 00:20:50,298
Good Life is an app for health monitoring,

296
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,821
and Get Well Soon, a pill reminder app that offers details on medicines.

297
00:20:55,601 --> 00:20:58,450
Every app has its strength in ease of use,

298
00:20:58,451 --> 00:21:01,858
which is suitable for people of all ages, and even patients.

299
00:21:03,273 --> 00:21:04,377
And?

300
00:21:04,618 --> 00:21:06,494
And there should be a new app,

301
00:21:06,495 --> 00:21:09,118
which I think would be perfect for people in this day and age,

302
00:21:09,417 --> 00:21:12,203
that can reveal a person's true ability

303
00:21:12,486 --> 00:21:14,846
even through their armor of elaborately constructed facade.

304
00:21:17,098 --> 00:21:18,600
Who is this arrogant woman?

305
00:21:18,993 --> 00:21:20,409
How did you let someone like her in here?

306
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:22,140
My name is Neeraaumpan.

307
00:21:32,135 --> 00:21:35,177
Neeraaumpan Paisarnpisai.

308
00:21:40,692 --> 00:21:41,692
Wait.

309
00:21:49,935 --> 00:21:51,379
Meet me in my office,

310
00:21:52,532 --> 00:21:53,901
Miss Neeraaumpan.

311
00:22:12,647 --> 00:22:14,710
It says here in your application that

312
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:17,296
you graduated top of your class.

313
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:20,300
That's so basic.

314
00:22:21,936 --> 00:22:24,021
There's nothing else worth noting besides that.

315
00:22:24,824 --> 00:22:27,178
Tell me something good about you.

316
00:22:27,628 --> 00:22:30,297
Convince me why I should hire you and give you a chance.

317
00:22:32,701 --> 00:22:35,219
I have a very good memory and I learn quickly.

318
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:41,020
I don't know if you'd believe me but I'd do anything to get this job.

319
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:42,276
Anything.

320
00:22:43,714 --> 00:22:44,749
Good to hear.

321
00:22:44,774 --> 00:22:45,774
Go get changed.

322
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:47,125
What?

323
00:22:47,675 --> 00:22:48,675
Why?

324
00:22:50,996 --> 00:22:52,501
You dress like an old lady.

325
00:22:53,094 --> 00:22:54,401
And it looks uncomfortable.

326
00:22:54,834 --> 00:22:55,834
Non.

327
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:00,777
Get her something that people in this century actually wear.

328
00:23:02,072 --> 00:23:06,220
Not something that makes it look like fashion died in the year 2000.

329
00:23:07,112 --> 00:23:09,498
Do you even know how much this dress means to me?

330
00:23:09,998 --> 00:23:11,058
I'm not changing.

331
00:23:11,683 --> 00:23:13,058
It's my company.

332
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:15,058
I set the rules.

333
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:17,461
If you don't change what you're wearing,

334
00:23:18,276 --> 00:23:19,276
I'm not hiring you.

335
00:23:25,566 --> 00:23:26,566
Here.

336
00:23:27,335 --> 00:23:30,400
This is everything you need to remember by tomorrow.

337
00:23:31,092 --> 00:23:32,339
If you can't do that,

338
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:34,218
I'm also not hiring you.

339
00:23:43,981 --> 00:23:45,512
This is all of it?

340
00:23:46,087 --> 00:23:48,580
Has your printer been broken since the year 2000?

341
00:23:48,581 --> 00:23:49,581
Hey-

342
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:50,816
That's enough.

343
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,538
That's all for now.

344
00:23:57,138 --> 00:23:58,538
You can memorize it bit by bit.

345
00:23:59,636 --> 00:24:00,636
Don't, Non.

346
00:24:01,302 --> 00:24:02,603
Don't get in her way.

347
00:24:12,226 --> 00:24:13,600
You wanted more, didn't you?

348
00:24:14,569 --> 00:24:15,906
Memorize all that by tomorrow,

349
00:24:16,735 --> 00:24:18,099
Miss Top-of-Her-Class.

350
00:24:18,768 --> 00:24:23,417
And you will present yourself in a more... fashionable way.

351
00:24:23,933 --> 00:24:24,933
Ten times more.

352
00:24:26,114 --> 00:24:27,379
Well, then. Please.

353
00:24:52,341 --> 00:24:54,101
She's here for a secretary interview

354
00:24:55,302 --> 00:24:57,299
but keeps arguing with her potential boss?

355
00:24:58,404 --> 00:24:59,738
Who does that?

356
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,735
Now I look like a bad guy.

357
00:25:04,611 --> 00:25:06,060
It's all her fault.

358
00:25:06,896 --> 00:25:07,896
You dork!

359
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,818
Was I too harsh?

360
00:25:18,534 --> 00:25:20,179
So he's the nice one, huh?

361
00:25:20,214 --> 00:25:21,214
Hmm?

362
00:25:21,261 --> 00:25:22,261
Did you say something?

363
00:25:23,983 --> 00:25:25,616
Oh, I...

364
00:25:26,973 --> 00:25:28,618
I saw people smiling at you.

365
00:25:29,178 --> 00:25:33,059
So I thought you must be a nice boss.

366
00:25:37,177 --> 00:25:39,714
I do get fussy, you know?

367
00:25:40,312 --> 00:25:42,050
And when I do, I'm worse than Veekit.

368
00:25:45,421 --> 00:25:46,611
Do you need help with that?

369
00:25:47,384 --> 00:25:49,062
Oh, it's alright.

370
00:25:49,625 --> 00:25:52,225
It's my job. I should be able to take full responsibility for it.

371
00:25:55,029 --> 00:25:56,021
Mr. Non.

372
00:25:56,022 --> 00:25:58,409
Will Mr. Veekit continue with the interview now?

373
00:25:59,583 --> 00:26:00,700
I don't think so.

374
00:26:02,443 --> 00:26:03,779
This is Neeraaumpan.

375
00:26:04,378 --> 00:26:06,395
Veekit's new secretary-in-training.

376
00:26:06,396 --> 00:26:07,396
What?

377
00:26:07,687 --> 00:26:09,103
She's hired?

378
00:26:09,778 --> 00:26:10,780
Wow!

379
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,698
Well, how long do you think you'll last?

380
00:26:16,096 --> 00:26:17,302
A long time.

381
00:26:17,698 --> 00:26:19,005
Definitely a long time.

382
00:26:20,866 --> 00:26:23,098
This is Miss Aew-eas, my secretary.

383
00:26:23,714 --> 00:26:25,900
You can ask her if you have any questions.

384
00:26:27,482 --> 00:26:29,162
You really live up to your beautiful name.

385
00:26:30,156 --> 00:26:33,281
I'll keep the contact info of the rest of the candidates

386
00:26:33,306 --> 00:26:34,562
in case we need another interview.

387
00:26:34,563 --> 00:26:35,705
Just to be safe.

388
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:41,583
Can you please take these binders to my car?

389
00:26:44,054 --> 00:26:46,661
Miss Neeraaumpan and I have a little makeover to get to...

390
00:26:47,728 --> 00:26:48,861
Maybe not quite so little.

391
00:26:49,752 --> 00:26:50,752
Yes.

392
00:26:51,172 --> 00:26:52,199
Do your best.

393
00:27:12,246 --> 00:27:15,978
I think most people care about appearances.

394
00:27:18,075 --> 00:27:19,507
You do?

395
00:27:20,896 --> 00:27:22,603
I bet anyone does.

396
00:27:24,922 --> 00:27:26,205
Imagine this.

397
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,978
You just meet someone,

398
00:27:29,553 --> 00:27:30,978
and you know nothing about them.

399
00:27:31,086 --> 00:27:34,306
Not who they are, what they like, what interests them.

400
00:27:34,806 --> 00:27:37,406
How would you assume what kind of a person they could be?

401
00:27:38,668 --> 00:27:40,338
Their appearances.

402
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,706
Isn't that right?

403
00:27:44,045 --> 00:27:45,101
Yes.

404
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:47,531
Alright.

405
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:50,113
There are millions and millions of books in the world.

406
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,918
If the content is great and interesting,

407
00:27:54,532 --> 00:27:58,902
but the cover is old, crumbling, unattractive,

408
00:27:59,062 --> 00:28:00,342
and says nothing about the book,

409
00:28:01,512 --> 00:28:03,335
who'd want to pick it up, right?

410
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,904
I guess.

411
00:28:08,961 --> 00:28:10,015
That's it.

412
00:28:10,016 --> 00:28:12,501
Vee is just trying to redesign your cover.

413
00:28:13,809 --> 00:28:15,859
He's interested in your skills.

414
00:28:16,247 --> 00:28:19,382
But your work experiences are much more limited than others.

415
00:28:20,795 --> 00:28:22,377
If you don't change your look,

416
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:27,378
what'd he tell the other candidates why he chose you?

417
00:28:33,189 --> 00:28:34,419
Why do you think that is,

418
00:28:37,124 --> 00:28:40,259
Miss Mirin Paisarnpisai?

419
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:44,871
You...

420
00:28:44,872 --> 00:28:47,779
Changing your name works wonders for you, doesn't it?

421
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,308
Whoever gave you that name?

422
00:29:04,329 --> 00:29:05,822
My mother told me to change it.

423
00:29:05,823 --> 00:29:08,380
She said changing my name will bring good luck.

424
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:14,057
But how'd you know about the name change?

425
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:16,908
You applied for a job here several times.

426
00:29:17,569 --> 00:29:18,803
I remember you.

427
00:29:20,265 --> 00:29:22,745
Would you mind me asking where your mother got that name from?

428
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:29,299
It's rather an uncommon name, don't you think?

429
00:29:32,147 --> 00:29:33,700
It's my mother's best friend's name.

430
00:29:34,264 --> 00:29:36,180
Not that I ever met her.

431
00:29:36,185 --> 00:29:38,027
Mom said she was her childhood friend.

432
00:29:38,028 --> 00:29:39,948
But they went their own ways in their adulthood.

433
00:29:40,176 --> 00:29:41,213
Why?

434
00:29:43,945 --> 00:29:45,580
What was your name before this?

435
00:29:46,424 --> 00:29:47,580
Mirin.

436
00:29:47,705 --> 00:29:49,707
Mirin was both my legal name and my nickname.

437
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,297
My mother just called me Rin, though.

438
00:29:53,497 --> 00:29:54,497
Mirin.

439
00:29:55,984 --> 00:29:57,298
That's a cute name.

440
00:29:57,728 --> 00:29:59,009
It's a shame you changed it.

441
00:30:04,356 --> 00:30:07,399
Let's take a look at some of these, shall we, Miss Neeraaumpan?

442
00:30:34,022 --> 00:30:35,305
Get her more of this.

443
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:37,510
And sort out her shoes.

444
00:30:39,628 --> 00:30:42,179
Next up is your hair.

445
00:30:42,413 --> 00:30:43,413
What?

446
00:30:58,181 --> 00:31:00,179
You're late.

447
00:31:00,508 --> 00:31:01,775
Was the traffic really bad?

448
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:02,813
Are you tired?

449
00:31:02,985 --> 00:31:04,177
Are you hungry, hon?

450
00:31:04,178 --> 00:31:05,178
I am.

451
00:31:05,179 --> 00:31:06,804
I haven't had dinner.

452
00:31:07,147 --> 00:31:08,353
Go get cleaned up.

453
00:31:08,354 --> 00:31:10,501
Your grandma made some soup for you.

454
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:17,398
Oh?

455
00:31:17,891 --> 00:31:19,337
What happened to your hair?

456
00:31:20,658 --> 00:31:21,900
Where are your glasses?

457
00:31:22,516 --> 00:31:25,204
And what's with all these shopping bags?

458
00:31:26,179 --> 00:31:27,498
They're clothes.

459
00:31:28,316 --> 00:31:30,818
Rin, isn't this a bit much?

460
00:31:32,271 --> 00:31:33,821
It wasn't me.

461
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:36,181
It's on the company's dime.

462
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:38,701
Company.

463
00:31:40,952 --> 00:31:41,952
Company?

464
00:31:42,534 --> 00:31:45,544
- I got the job, Mom! - You did?

465
00:31:46,057 --> 00:31:47,942
What? What? What's going on?

466
00:31:48,143 --> 00:31:49,400
What is it?

467
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:54,030
Grandma, I got the job!

468
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,456
Well done, my girl.

469
00:32:00,457 --> 00:32:02,980
Grandma, it worked.

470
00:32:02,981 --> 00:32:04,981
Your dress totally brought me luck.

471
00:32:05,886 --> 00:32:06,889
Good job, dear.

472
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:10,377
Oh, but... I'm still on probation.

473
00:32:10,378 --> 00:32:11,689
I don't know how long.

474
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:12,698
But don't worry.

475
00:32:13,565 --> 00:32:15,894
I'll make sure they hire me.

476
00:32:17,115 --> 00:32:20,860
From now on, you two don't have to work hard in the kitchen anymore.

477
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,654
I'll take care of you.

478
00:32:22,655 --> 00:32:23,941
Oh, baby.

479
00:32:25,107 --> 00:32:26,741
You're the best.

480
00:32:49,073 --> 00:32:51,498
Rin, you're still up?

481
00:32:52,072 --> 00:32:53,498
I'll go soon.

482
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:57,504
I have to memorize everything.

483
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:00,232
What are you baking today?

484
00:33:00,514 --> 00:33:01,722
Apple pie.

485
00:33:01,723 --> 00:33:03,600
We have some orders, 40 pieces to be exact.

486
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:05,418
That's all I'll make today.

487
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,989
Alright. I'll help.

488
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:08,000
No, you won't.

489
00:33:08,001 --> 00:33:08,987
Go to bed.

490
00:33:08,988 --> 00:33:10,908
Sleep for a few hours.

491
00:33:11,097 --> 00:33:13,310
But I'm not tired.

492
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:14,826
I'm so ready.

493
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:16,412
I can't wait to go to work.

494
00:33:16,635 --> 00:33:18,778
I got it all memorized.

495
00:33:20,006 --> 00:33:21,200
I can help.

496
00:33:21,201 --> 00:33:22,201
Let's go.

497
00:33:22,591 --> 00:33:24,393
Come on. I'm not tired.

498
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:31,338
The guest list for the event tonight.

499
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,310
Miss Tanya will be coming with her mother.

500
00:33:37,461 --> 00:33:38,700
Mrs. Sroyphet invited her.

501
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,707
Thank you.

502
00:33:45,613 --> 00:33:46,712
Mr. Non.

503
00:34:17,035 --> 00:34:20,058
Overall, well done, Miss Neeraaumpan.

504
00:34:20,815 --> 00:34:22,611
Why don't you go say hello to Veekit?

505
00:34:22,864 --> 00:34:24,297
See if he approves.

506
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,377
Good cover.

507
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:32,377
Great content.

508
00:34:32,534 --> 00:34:34,377
You're an attractive book now.

509
00:34:35,059 --> 00:34:36,059
Trust me.

510
00:35:19,778 --> 00:35:22,102
Good morning, Mr. Veekit.

511
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,617
It's Neeraaumpan, your new secretary.

512
00:35:57,154 --> 00:35:58,208
Strange.

513
00:35:59,151 --> 00:36:02,057
Yesterday you smelled of

514
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:04,057
grilled pork,

515
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:05,375
marketplace,

516
00:36:05,716 --> 00:36:06,819
and traffic.

517
00:36:13,498 --> 00:36:14,707
But today,

518
00:36:16,718 --> 00:36:18,407
you smell...

519
00:36:22,104 --> 00:36:23,298
Delicious.

520
00:36:35,384 --> 00:36:37,249
You smell like...

521
00:36:44,822 --> 00:36:46,620
You smell like apple pie.

522
00:36:48,895 --> 00:36:49,895
Alright.

523
00:36:51,429 --> 00:36:54,203
Here comes your first test as my secretary.

524
00:36:55,126 --> 00:36:58,538
And that is making hot chocolate.

525
00:37:00,347 --> 00:37:03,338
Go on, Miss Neeraaumpan.

526
00:37:40,904 --> 00:37:42,904
Don't even ask me how to make it.

527
00:37:43,483 --> 00:37:45,898
It was in one of the binders I gave you.

528
00:37:46,958 --> 00:37:49,539
If that's the kind of hot chocolate you want, you have to wait.

529
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:51,539
Wait?

530
00:37:54,253 --> 00:37:55,796
How dare you suggest-

531
00:37:55,797 --> 00:37:57,651
With the ingredients you have,

532
00:37:57,652 --> 00:37:59,123
no matter how many times you try,

533
00:37:59,124 --> 00:38:01,124
you would never get the flavor you want.

534
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,504
Something you just need to trust other people to do it.

535
00:38:04,985 --> 00:38:06,504
Don't be so self-centered,

536
00:38:07,337 --> 00:38:08,938
even if you're the boss here.

537
00:38:14,034 --> 00:38:15,034
Fine.

538
00:38:16,398 --> 00:38:19,942
But if I wait and I don't get exactly what I want,

539
00:38:21,673 --> 00:38:23,497
you're getting fired today.

540
00:38:24,673 --> 00:38:25,747
Yes, sir.

541
00:38:45,181 --> 00:38:46,718
Do you think she'd make it?

542
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:51,180
I even dare say she's the one.

543
00:38:53,443 --> 00:38:55,817
What makes you so sure?

544
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:03,820
Because I like her better than anyone we ever found for Veekit.

545
00:41:08,313 --> 00:41:09,313
Neeraaumpan.

546
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:19,450
Directed by Ekkasit Trakulkasemsuk and Pantip Vibultham.

547
00:41:43,821 --> 00:41:45,008
Here, baby.

548
00:41:45,524 --> 00:41:47,314
Wow!

549
00:41:56,502 --> 00:41:58,807
Your hot chocolate is the best, Mom.

550
00:42:02,736 --> 00:42:04,058
Then drink all you want, dear.

551
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:11,737
I'm taking her on a field trip.

552
00:42:12,215 --> 00:42:15,715
The party we're going to is a thank you party for our partners.

553
00:42:15,716 --> 00:42:20,019
You must stay by my side and tell me who's approaching me.

554
00:42:20,339 --> 00:42:24,442
That's Mr. Methawee, your partner and investor.

555
00:42:24,443 --> 00:42:28,933
Keep Up is a diet app that helps users reach their goal weight.

556
00:42:28,934 --> 00:42:30,543
I send you my admiration, Mr. Veekit.

557
00:42:34,286 --> 00:42:35,899

560
00:42:39,372 --> 00:42:41,140
All you have is brains, and nothing else!

561
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:42,694
Try to learn and listen!
