1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:05,262
The incident occurred while it was under my supervision.

2
00:00:05,561 --> 00:00:06,911
This causes damage to the company.

3
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:08,405
From now on,

4
00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:10,832
I guess you need to rebuild it.

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,477
I think the best solution for everyone is that I should resign.

6
00:00:13,811 --> 00:00:17,459
The person who will replace me as the new CEO is

7
00:00:17,711 --> 00:00:19,779
Mr. Chanon Kanchanarak.

8
00:00:21,011 --> 00:00:24,217
Hello, I'm Tanya Kanokkul.

9
00:00:24,534 --> 00:00:28,302
We are going to work together to manage Next Innovation.

10
00:00:28,444 --> 00:00:30,017
How did Chanon let it happen?

11
00:00:32,477 --> 00:00:33,502
Who are you?

12
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,205
Don't.

13
00:00:37,048 --> 00:00:38,048
Don't.

14
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:41,942
Do you remember anything?

15
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,023
I remember that...

16
00:00:44,543 --> 00:00:47,022
Sroyphet was mean to me.

17
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,080
Mr. Vee.

18
00:01:02,192 --> 00:01:04,779
How is Aunt Nee? Has her memory returned?

19
00:01:07,017 --> 00:01:08,017
No.

20
00:01:28,311 --> 00:01:32,508
I asked her what she remembered.

21
00:01:34,653 --> 00:01:36,780
She doesn't remember anything recent.

22
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:40,420
The only thing she does remember is...

23
00:01:44,974 --> 00:01:46,902
how mean Aunt Sroy was to her.

24
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,007
Mean?

25
00:01:53,028 --> 00:01:54,028
Yes.

26
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:02,659
Seen said the reason her condition is so severe

27
00:02:02,918 --> 00:02:08,005
is because of the trauma she went through in her past.

28
00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:12,810
What will you do now?

29
00:02:17,108 --> 00:02:19,739
I think I'll ask her about it when she comes to.

30
00:02:21,811 --> 00:02:23,709
It will probably be helpful with her treatment.

31
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:36,888
Oh, hey, you went to Next today, didn't you?

32
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,402
Did anyone do anything to you?

33
00:02:39,072 --> 00:02:39,730
Hmm?

34
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:40,631
Let me see.

35
00:02:40,656 --> 00:02:41,711
Mr. Vee.

36
00:02:41,942 --> 00:02:43,782
Who would even dare?

37
00:02:43,798 --> 00:02:46,017
I'm a fighter, I'll have you know.

38
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,407
A fighter? The size of a chihuahua?

39
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:52,019
Mr. Vee.

40
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:54,666
Sorry.

41
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:55,675
I'm kidding.

42
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,619
What about the matter with Big Noi and Next?

43
00:03:02,702 --> 00:03:03,702
What's going on?

44
00:03:06,442 --> 00:03:07,480
It's over.

45
00:03:07,491 --> 00:03:08,491
What?

46
00:03:09,097 --> 00:03:11,580
Non is just going to let Big Noi go?

47
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:13,204
"Throw away" is a more fitting term.

48
00:03:13,371 --> 00:03:15,321
Mr. Chanon said so himself,

49
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:18,256
something along the line of, "aren't suitable as business partners."

50
00:03:18,525 --> 00:03:22,451
Big Noi did ask him if he had consulted Mr. Prapob about this.

51
00:03:22,465 --> 00:03:24,943
But Mr. Chanon insisted this was his decision to make alone.

52
00:03:29,253 --> 00:03:31,016
If we look at it from Non's point of view,

53
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,060
I guess Tanya alone would be enough.

54
00:03:39,874 --> 00:03:41,405
If it's just about money,

55
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,103
I bet Tanya is even richer than Big Noi.

56
00:03:46,331 --> 00:03:48,457
But when it comes to credibility,

57
00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:50,219
Big Noi definitely wins in that department.

58
00:03:50,927 --> 00:03:52,219
However...

59
00:03:52,591 --> 00:03:55,536
Non and Tanya,

60
00:03:56,229 --> 00:03:57,536
they are both young.

61
00:03:59,237 --> 00:04:01,537
Maybe they can pique young people's interest.

62
00:04:03,995 --> 00:04:09,106
So that's why Mrs. Sroyphet wanted her as Mr. Chanon's business partner.

63
00:04:11,524 --> 00:04:12,657
Exactly.

64
00:04:13,434 --> 00:04:16,100
I'm afraid there's still a chance for the game to turn around, though.

65
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,420
What do you mean?

66
00:04:19,906 --> 00:04:22,463
The way she acted at the press conference.

67
00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:24,463
I'll be honest,

68
00:04:25,776 --> 00:04:27,462
I don't trust Tanya.

69
00:04:30,011 --> 00:04:32,500
The person who will replace me as the new CEO is

70
00:04:32,717 --> 00:04:34,700
Mr. Chanon Kanchanarak.

71
00:04:37,882 --> 00:04:42,019
Hello, I'm Tanya Kanokkul.

72
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:46,602
We are going to work together to manage Next Innovation.

73
00:04:47,164 --> 00:04:49,983
We will restore your trust.

74
00:04:50,362 --> 00:04:53,417
We will take Next Innovation higher.

75
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,490
Jirawat Sutivanichsak

76
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,810
Supassara Thanachart

77
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,730
Ishikawa Plowden

78
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:28,330
Phatchatorn Thanawat / Wanwimol Jaenasavamethee

79
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,810
Phanuroj Chalermkijporntavee / Chayakorn Jutamas

80
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:04,530
Directed by Ekkasit Trakulkasemsuk and Pantip Vibultham

81
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,530
THE UNCONTROLLABLE GAME

82
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,408
Yes, Aew-eas?

83
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:15,539
(Hello, Manit.)

84
00:06:15,785 --> 00:06:18,537
Mr. Chanon wants to meet you at 10 o'clock tomorrow, if that's okay with you.

85
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:19,813
(Of course.)

86
00:06:19,829 --> 00:06:22,108
I'm always at the office.

87
00:06:22,445 --> 00:06:23,496
Feel free to call for me anytime.

88
00:06:24,573 --> 00:06:27,219
The thing is, Mr. Chanon doesn't want to meet at the office.

89
00:06:27,451 --> 00:06:29,580
(I'll send you the location later.)

90
00:06:30,072 --> 00:06:31,216
Alright.

91
00:06:31,798 --> 00:06:33,219
Hold on, what is this meeting about?

92
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,791
(I don't know, either.)

93
00:06:35,801 --> 00:06:37,300
(Mr. Chanon didn't say.)

94
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,577
So the meeting is at 10 o'clock tomorrow.

95
00:06:39,725 --> 00:06:42,582
(Can you please relay the message to Maewkwak?)

96
00:06:43,047 --> 00:06:44,047
Of course.

97
00:06:44,048 --> 00:06:44,810
(Goodbye.)

98
00:06:45,044 --> 00:06:46,044
Bye.

99
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:49,601
What could this be about?

100
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:06,099
Mom?

101
00:07:09,546 --> 00:07:10,546
Vee.

102
00:07:12,253 --> 00:07:13,253
Mom.

103
00:07:13,462 --> 00:07:14,462
Mom.

104
00:07:15,299 --> 00:07:17,407
Do-Do you remember now?

105
00:07:21,976 --> 00:07:22,962
Please sit down.

106
00:07:22,974 --> 00:07:25,505
I'll get you breakfast.

107
00:07:38,186 --> 00:07:39,186
Here you go.

108
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,459
Thank you.

109
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,540
Was I gone long this time?

110
00:07:57,558 --> 00:08:00,013
Did I cause you trouble again?

111
00:08:03,435 --> 00:08:04,777
It was no trouble at all.

112
00:08:05,654 --> 00:08:08,497
It just took me by surprise.

113
00:08:11,385 --> 00:08:12,385
Mom.

114
00:08:12,997 --> 00:08:15,299
I have something I need to ask you.

115
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:23,499
You said... Aunt Sroy was mean to you.

116
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,954
Will you tell me about it honestly, Mom?

117
00:08:35,091 --> 00:08:37,023
This could affect your treatment.

118
00:08:43,096 --> 00:08:44,140
Your father...

119
00:08:45,722 --> 00:08:48,182
Your father once told me that

120
00:08:49,607 --> 00:08:52,862
your Aunt Sroy doesn't like us much because

121
00:08:54,891 --> 00:09:01,299
she was indignant that she put all her effort into helping your grandfather build the company,

122
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:08,663
only for him to give it over to your father as soon as he graduated.

123
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,906
Aunt Sroy must have felt about Dad

124
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,607
what Non is feeling about me right now.

125
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:22,607
But your grandfather loves Chanon.

126
00:09:22,746 --> 00:09:24,662
He's the first grandson born into the family.

127
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,136
But when...

128
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:30,608
When your father married me and we had you,

129
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:34,016
you became...

130
00:09:34,105 --> 00:09:35,811
A direct heir?

131
00:09:36,469 --> 00:09:37,469
Am I right?

132
00:09:38,133 --> 00:09:39,506
Y-Yeah.

133
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,576
Your aunt...

134
00:09:46,831 --> 00:09:48,608
Your aunt doesn't like me much.

135
00:09:51,346 --> 00:09:52,863
She told me every day

136
00:09:55,069 --> 00:09:56,700
that I only married your father for his money.

137
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:01,500
I put up with it.

138
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:05,604
Then your father passed,

139
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,057
and it just got worse and worse.

140
00:10:11,574 --> 00:10:14,060
When I realized I was getting sick,

141
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:19,057
I couldn't help but be afraid—

142
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:23,405
Afraid of what she could do to me.

143
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,500
And I was also...

144
00:10:31,967 --> 00:10:34,462
I was also afraid that I would be a burden to you.

145
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,700
Mom, Mom.

146
00:10:36,956 --> 00:10:37,720
Mom.

147
00:10:37,745 --> 00:10:38,745
Mom.

148
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,831
Mom, listen to me.

149
00:10:40,862 --> 00:10:41,862
Mom.

150
00:10:44,191 --> 00:10:46,007
I never think of you that way.

151
00:10:51,063 --> 00:10:55,980
Even if one day you don't remember me anymore,

152
00:10:57,056 --> 00:11:02,010
I will never forget that you're my mother.

153
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:32,924
Hello, Mr. Chanon

154
00:11:33,334 --> 00:11:34,334
Please take a seat.

155
00:11:37,025 --> 00:11:38,700
Thank you for coming out here to see me.

156
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,171
It's no problem at all.

157
00:11:40,183 --> 00:11:41,617
What can we do for you?

158
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:50,407
How could you take an order from Tanya without consulting me first?

159
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,023
What you did could have ruined Next.

160
00:11:54,382 --> 00:11:55,382
Oh?

161
00:11:55,602 --> 00:11:58,660
But Maewkwak and I thought that order came from you.

162
00:11:58,977 --> 00:12:00,660
You and Miss Tanya are best friends.

163
00:12:00,965 --> 00:12:02,605
I doubt you weren't clued in on the matter.

164
00:12:06,619 --> 00:12:11,897
From now on, please only take orders from me directly.

165
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,139
But wasn't it exactly because of Miss Tanya's order

166
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:22,305
that put you in the CEO chair right now?

167
00:12:23,026 --> 00:12:25,063
We even got a bonus for it, you know?

168
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:25,730
Mr. Manit.

169
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:29,057
I promise we only did it because we thought you were in on it.

170
00:12:35,718 --> 00:12:40,208
Imagine if I let slip that it was actually an order from an executive.

171
00:12:41,257 --> 00:12:43,340
It really could ruin Next, like you said, don't you think?

172
00:12:44,502 --> 00:12:47,506
But Miss Tanya promised me a reward,

173
00:12:48,562 --> 00:12:51,579
and that's the only thing stopping me from spilling the beans.

174
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:55,899
Why don't you start thinking right away about how big a bonus I should get?

175
00:12:57,434 --> 00:12:58,434
Excuse me.

176
00:13:13,971 --> 00:13:14,971
Hey, wait.

177
00:13:17,074 --> 00:13:18,681
Don't you think that was a little too much?

178
00:13:18,694 --> 00:13:19,983
He's our boss.

179
00:13:20,186 --> 00:13:21,851
If I didn't intimidate him now,

180
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:23,635
they are definitely going to make us take the blame for this.

181
00:13:23,647 --> 00:13:24,891
Rich people are like that.

182
00:13:24,902 --> 00:13:26,139
They use you and throw you away,

183
00:13:26,148 --> 00:13:28,022
and then they act like they have nothing to do with it.

184
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,142
We need to talk to Tanya.

185
00:13:31,613 --> 00:13:33,142
Gotta know what she's planning.

186
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:35,503
And if I don't get what I deserve,

187
00:13:36,234 --> 00:13:37,657
I'll expose them all.

188
00:13:46,186 --> 00:13:49,303
What the hell is so important that I "must" come right away?

189
00:13:49,469 --> 00:13:50,909
Please, have a seat, Miss Tanya.

190
00:13:54,485 --> 00:13:56,737
Mr. Chanon just sat Maewkwak and me down for a talk.

191
00:13:57,011 --> 00:14:01,182
He was furious that I took orders from you without consulting him.

192
00:14:02,828 --> 00:14:04,462
Are you planning to make us your scapegoat, Miss?

193
00:14:05,982 --> 00:14:09,780
Don't tell me you're asking for more money.

194
00:14:10,105 --> 00:14:12,617
I believe the two of us very much deserve it.

195
00:14:13,297 --> 00:14:16,725
How about you give me a bonus for pitting me against Mr. Chanon?

196
00:14:17,893 --> 00:14:19,577
And I'll tell you what to watch out for.

197
00:14:20,702 --> 00:14:21,702
What?

198
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:23,530
What should I watch out for?

199
00:14:25,152 --> 00:14:28,540
Mr. Chanon really looks like he doesn't want anything to do with this.

200
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:30,002
He's properly angry.

201
00:14:33,097 --> 00:14:34,807
He could likely decide to just ditch you.

202
00:14:39,878 --> 00:14:43,459
Do let me know anytime if you need any help, Miss Tanya.

203
00:14:56,668 --> 00:14:57,668
Hey.

204
00:14:57,789 --> 00:14:58,789
Catch.

205
00:15:00,271 --> 00:15:01,297
What the hell?

206
00:15:01,804 --> 00:15:02,804
Well?

207
00:15:03,056 --> 00:15:04,299
It's snacks.

208
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:05,149
You can't tell?

209
00:15:05,157 --> 00:15:06,198
Of course I can.

210
00:15:06,521 --> 00:15:07,567
But why are you giving it to me?

211
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:08,700
Eat.

212
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,500
Might get your sanity back.

213
00:15:11,219 --> 00:15:13,499
If that's all you want to say, you can shut up now.

214
00:15:13,619 --> 00:15:14,619
It's annoying.

215
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:17,502
But you see, I think we—

216
00:15:20,468 --> 00:15:21,468
What the hell?

217
00:15:25,688 --> 00:15:27,377
But it's so good.

218
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:33,557
Smells great.

219
00:15:34,866 --> 00:15:36,906
What do you mean you can't finish it in time?

220
00:15:38,696 --> 00:15:40,908
You told me you could definitely meet the deadline.

221
00:15:41,226 --> 00:15:44,380
You should be able to deliver what you promised.

222
00:15:44,967 --> 00:15:47,780
I don't care what working with Veekit was like.

223
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:51,582
You're working for me now so you adjust to me.

224
00:15:52,725 --> 00:15:53,725
Excuse me.

225
00:15:53,937 --> 00:15:54,937
Goodbye.

226
00:15:58,651 --> 00:16:00,099
Mr. Prapob wants to see you, sir.

227
00:16:02,438 --> 00:16:03,804
Ugh, fine.

228
00:16:07,897 --> 00:16:11,022
Then, I have three favors to ask.

229
00:16:12,395 --> 00:16:14,900
Finish up these old documents.

230
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,114
Second, give the design team a little nudge.

231
00:16:18,122 --> 00:16:19,376
They're going at snail's speed.

232
00:16:19,388 --> 00:16:24,419
Third, give me a rough estimate of how much we need to pay to clean up the mess Tanya made.

233
00:16:28,105 --> 00:16:30,604
I thought it was Mr. Veekit who leaked those data.

234
00:16:35,823 --> 00:16:38,008
Manit leaked it on Tanya's order.

235
00:16:39,155 --> 00:16:42,002
But people might think it was your doing.

236
00:16:42,444 --> 00:16:43,444
I know.

237
00:16:44,991 --> 00:16:47,263
I'm working on fixing it.

238
00:16:50,733 --> 00:16:53,937
Why don't you go meet Mr. Prapob first?

239
00:16:54,131 --> 00:16:56,014
We'll work this out later.

240
00:16:59,571 --> 00:17:01,817
Thank you for understanding, Miss Eas.

241
00:17:02,817 --> 00:17:03,817
Of course.

242
00:17:13,562 --> 00:17:14,705
Holy crap.

243
00:17:19,933 --> 00:17:20,962
Did you want to see me, Grandpa?

244
00:17:20,977 --> 00:17:21,428
Yes.

245
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,604
Sit down, Chanon.

246
00:17:32,149 --> 00:17:33,782
I talked to Big Noi.

247
00:17:35,133 --> 00:17:38,219
She told me you had ended our partnership with her.

248
00:17:39,502 --> 00:17:41,859
Yes, and there are only a few papers left to finalize the matter.

249
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:46,379
She's the best investor for Next Innovation.

250
00:17:46,906 --> 00:17:50,457
She doesn't invest easily, and yet she chose us.

251
00:17:50,995 --> 00:17:54,601
How could you make such a big decision on your own?

252
00:17:54,945 --> 00:17:56,302
Why didn't you talk to me?

253
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:02,179
Big Noi wanted to invest with Veekit, not me.

254
00:18:03,385 --> 00:18:05,500
She doesn't feel comfortable working with me,

255
00:18:05,734 --> 00:18:07,607
and I share her sentiment.

256
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:12,459
Tanya's credibility will never come anywhere near Big Noi's.

257
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:19,422
I do believe my credibility alone is enough.

258
00:18:21,437 --> 00:18:24,817
One more thing, Tanya's investment is much more generous.

259
00:18:25,165 --> 00:18:27,712
Sure, we might need two investors for this,

260
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:29,580
but that will make up for what Big Noi has offered.

261
00:18:31,457 --> 00:18:34,380
With her attitude at the press conference the other day,

262
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:40,897
are you sure you can still trust Tanya to be a good partner and executive?

263
00:18:48,751 --> 00:18:50,377
Everything's alright on my end.

264
00:18:50,478 --> 00:18:52,377
How about yours?

265
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:53,875
It's all done.

266
00:18:54,623 --> 00:18:58,708
I'll have Aunt Noi sign the papers as soon as possible and send them back to you.

267
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:04,411
Oh, and, we might need you to show up on the day they investigate the leak.

268
00:19:04,702 --> 00:19:07,057
They want to talk to every involved party.

269
00:19:08,902 --> 00:19:11,217
Are you okay?

270
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,102
Oh. Yes, I am.

271
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:20,299
I've been busy lately so I'm just thinking how I'll fit that into my schedule.

272
00:19:21,388 --> 00:19:24,109
Excuse me for now. I have to get ready for a meeting.

273
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:49,530
Mr. Vee?

274
00:19:50,851 --> 00:19:52,299
What are you doing here?

275
00:19:53,128 --> 00:19:55,737
I'm here to pick up my adorable teeny-tiny girlfriend, of course.

276
00:20:14,211 --> 00:20:15,314
Hey, Miss Girlfriend,

277
00:20:17,761 --> 00:20:19,007
do you want to go on a date?

278
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:20,417
A date?

279
00:20:21,091 --> 00:20:22,091
Now?

280
00:20:22,475 --> 00:20:23,610
Yes.

281
00:20:24,948 --> 00:20:30,259
We haven't been spending some quality time together, you know?

282
00:20:30,951 --> 00:20:33,260
All we do every day is try to solve some problems,

283
00:20:34,242 --> 00:20:36,010
which you've been a big help to me.

284
00:20:38,856 --> 00:20:40,097
It's my pleasure.

285
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,376
That's why I want to thank you.

286
00:20:46,881 --> 00:20:47,881
Thank you.

287
00:20:48,223 --> 00:20:50,093
You're like the personification of all the vitamins rolled into one.

288
00:20:50,105 --> 00:20:51,001
Wait.

289
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:51,705
Hmm?

290
00:20:51,771 --> 00:20:54,171
Did you just give me another pet name?

291
00:20:54,182 --> 00:20:55,903
Why? Do you prefer being called a chihuahua?

292
00:20:56,379 --> 00:20:57,410
Mr. Vee.

293
00:20:59,635 --> 00:21:00,936
Where do you want to go?

294
00:21:04,586 --> 00:21:09,506
I want to take you to see an entirely ordinary world.

295
00:21:10,362 --> 00:21:14,608
Something... someone like you wouldn't be used to.

296
00:22:34,367 --> 00:22:35,462
What are you thinking about?

297
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,740
Oh...

298
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:42,822
I'm just thinking about how many children we will have.

299
00:22:43,477 --> 00:22:44,477
What?

300
00:22:45,874 --> 00:22:47,416
Why are you so surprised?

301
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:48,968
Don't you want to get married?

302
00:22:48,977 --> 00:22:51,408
Wait, are you infertile?

303
00:22:52,343 --> 00:22:54,020
I am not.

304
00:22:54,327 --> 00:22:58,417
I mean I... don't know.

305
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:04,100
You just took me by surprise because...

306
00:23:05,297 --> 00:23:09,737
I was also thinking about how many children we'll have.

307
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:12,742
I'm fine with anything.

308
00:23:13,414 --> 00:23:14,703
How about this?

309
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:18,142
Once everything is over,

310
00:23:19,948 --> 00:23:20,948
let's just do it.

311
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:22,937
If you don't mind, of course.

312
00:23:22,951 --> 00:23:23,973
Sure don't!

313
00:23:23,982 --> 00:23:24,613
Oops.

314
00:23:24,727 --> 00:23:27,094
Did that make me seem easy?

315
00:23:28,712 --> 00:23:29,779
I am even easier, then.

316
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:36,019
How about we make a "horn" pose together?

317
00:23:37,284 --> 00:23:38,571
What are you playing?

318
00:23:38,586 --> 00:23:39,586
Huh?

319
00:23:40,865 --> 00:23:42,594
This is so silly.

320
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:52,108
I'll run you over.

321
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,340
- You're cheating.
- You can never reach my hand.

322
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:58,497
That's cheating.

323
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,428
Is everything ready, Miss Eas?

324
00:24:13,435 --> 00:24:14,611
Is my grandfather here?

325
00:24:14,968 --> 00:24:16,099
He's on his way.

326
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:18,099
Everything's ready to go.

327
00:24:18,447 --> 00:24:21,822
Everyone seems a little confused with this emergency meeting, though.

328
00:24:24,651 --> 00:24:27,140
Some people are too busy for some pop-up meeting, does he know that?

329
00:24:27,494 --> 00:24:29,614
Do you know why your grandfather called us in?

330
00:24:30,017 --> 00:24:31,139
I have no idea.

331
00:24:33,548 --> 00:24:35,379
What the hell is this emergency meeting about?

332
00:24:35,385 --> 00:24:37,382
I cancelled my yoga class for this, you know?

333
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:45,819
Miss Eas, is there any information on the agenda Grandpa told you to prepare?

334
00:24:47,225 --> 00:24:50,768
There's the old project between Miss Big Noi and Mr. Veekit,

335
00:24:50,777 --> 00:24:52,619
and the budget for next year.

336
00:24:53,565 --> 00:24:54,903
Next year's budget?

337
00:24:56,477 --> 00:24:58,696
Then there's nothing urgent to call us in for—

338
00:25:00,397 --> 00:25:03,697
You can call it urgent, but I guess it can also wait.

339
00:25:05,062 --> 00:25:06,062
Dad.

340
00:25:22,894 --> 00:25:24,022
Are you all ready?

341
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:30,108
Apologies for the short notice.

342
00:25:31,237 --> 00:25:36,337
I just finished setting up an internal affair investigation team.

343
00:25:37,226 --> 00:25:40,690
I want your cooperation with the interrogation.

344
00:25:41,728 --> 00:25:42,690
Wait a minute.

345
00:25:42,722 --> 00:25:45,019
This is the first I've heard of an investigation.

346
00:25:45,228 --> 00:25:47,859
I just finished setting up a team, Miss Tanya.

347
00:25:47,914 --> 00:25:52,601
And you didn't think to consult me or Non while you were setting it up?

348
00:25:53,136 --> 00:25:56,017
You left both the CEO and the major shareholder clueless?

349
00:25:57,097 --> 00:26:01,459
Which part of this plan do you take an issue with, Miss Tanya?

350
00:26:01,758 --> 00:26:02,804
It's—

351
00:26:03,349 --> 00:26:07,226
The issue is you're bringing total strangers to investigate an internal affair

352
00:26:07,294 --> 00:26:10,220
without notifying either the CEO and the major shareholder.

353
00:26:10,428 --> 00:26:13,097
Are they qualified? Who are they?

354
00:26:13,114 --> 00:26:14,899
Why does it have to be this team?

355
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:19,491
At the very least, I'm sure they are hired on the company's dime.

356
00:26:20,408 --> 00:26:22,056
You should give us a heads up.

357
00:26:22,151 --> 00:26:23,151
Tanya.

358
00:26:25,936 --> 00:26:28,202
Well, allow me to ask,

359
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,004
excuse me for being blunt,

360
00:26:31,622 --> 00:26:34,811
but what is your role in this company, Mr. Prapob?

361
00:26:35,915 --> 00:26:37,182
Besides being the founder, that is.

362
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:38,650
Tanya.

363
00:26:40,293 --> 00:26:45,207
Chanon is the current president, and is responsible for managing the company.

364
00:26:45,217 --> 00:26:46,979
I am the major shareholder.

365
00:26:46,985 --> 00:26:48,699
I have my share of management.

366
00:26:50,857 --> 00:26:52,894
Putting the matter with Veekit aside,

367
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,404
what do you do here, Mr. Prapob?

368
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,840
Tanya.

369
00:26:58,988 --> 00:27:02,379
Your Grandpa is old enough to think about retiring, don't you think?

370
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,480
Watch it.

371
00:27:03,645 --> 00:27:05,105
Stop what you're saying.

372
00:27:06,262 --> 00:27:08,740
If you guys are going to get so emotional,

373
00:27:09,108 --> 00:27:12,937
just keep your business and your inferior complexes in the family, maybe?

374
00:27:14,779 --> 00:27:17,309
I'm taking Next Innovation further.

375
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,380
We've been walking in the same spot for far too long.

376
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:22,105
You don't own this company.

377
00:27:22,948 --> 00:27:25,542
But of course, I do, don't I?

378
00:27:25,906 --> 00:27:28,900
The shares I hold and the money I spend on this company

379
00:27:29,605 --> 00:27:31,536
is enough to rival the CEO.

380
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,017
I can easily fire him, even.

381
00:27:38,937 --> 00:27:42,600
If anyone neglects to keep me in the loop, like he did,

382
00:27:42,782 --> 00:27:44,705
then I have a right to drop all kinds of decorum.

383
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:49,429
Try me and you'll see what I can do to this company.

384
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,429
Stop it, Tanya.

385
00:27:52,364 --> 00:27:53,364
Stop fight—

386
00:27:58,685 --> 00:27:59,685
Sir?

387
00:28:00,202 --> 00:28:00,875
Grandpa!

388
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:01,940
Dad!

389
00:28:02,524 --> 00:28:03,524
Sir!

390
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,700
Dad!

391
00:28:04,794 --> 00:28:05,746
- Grandpa.
- Dad!

392
00:28:05,791 --> 00:28:06,791
Grandpa.

393
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,552
Hello?

394
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:10,580
- Dad! Dad, what's wrong?
- We need an ambulance at Next Innovation.

395
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,477
Right now!

396
00:28:11,484 --> 00:28:13,370
The ambulance will be here soon, Dad. Please, hold on.

397
00:28:50,674 --> 00:28:51,674
Non.

398
00:28:53,758 --> 00:28:54,979
What happened?

399
00:28:55,165 --> 00:28:56,979
Did the doctor say anything yet?

400
00:28:57,161 --> 00:28:58,503
What happened to Granddad?

401
00:29:01,543 --> 00:29:02,911
They just took him inside just now.

402
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:12,208
I'm sorry.

403
00:29:15,198 --> 00:29:16,411
I'm really sorry.

404
00:29:43,659 --> 00:29:44,814
I'm sorry.

405
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:55,179
I didn't mean for something like this to happen.

406
00:30:05,669 --> 00:30:06,696
I'm sorry.

407
00:30:06,982 --> 00:30:07,982
It's okay.

408
00:30:08,256 --> 00:30:09,303
It's okay.

409
00:30:11,558 --> 00:30:16,911
My Granddad, your Grandpa, will be alright.

410
00:30:48,854 --> 00:30:49,854
Hello.

411
00:30:49,877 --> 00:30:53,100
Bring me my share purchase agreement and the CEO's.

412
00:30:53,417 --> 00:30:54,419
Immediately.

413
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:52,983
I know you're not hungry, but please drink some water, or you'll get sick.

414
00:31:58,265 --> 00:31:59,939
I won't bother you about eating again.

415
00:32:16,724 --> 00:32:18,004
Sit with me.

416
00:32:22,925 --> 00:32:23,925
Yes.

417
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:35,208
Don't look so expectant.

418
00:32:35,896 --> 00:32:38,105
I'm not venting to someone like you.

419
00:32:38,863 --> 00:32:40,697
Oh. Right.

420
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:50,579
I'm thinking if I should be mad at you.

421
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:51,906
Sorry?

422
00:32:55,714 --> 00:32:57,903
I'm thinking who I should blame,

423
00:32:58,521 --> 00:33:00,007
who I should berate,

424
00:33:00,453 --> 00:33:02,108
who I should punish.

425
00:33:03,306 --> 00:33:07,417
But I realize there's no one here to blame but me.

426
00:33:12,241 --> 00:33:13,408
I think—

427
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:14,820
Don't talk.

428
00:33:17,434 --> 00:33:18,496
Yes.

429
00:33:33,521 --> 00:33:34,808
I should have...

430
00:33:37,343 --> 00:33:39,499
I should have been kinder.

431
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,506
I hate it even more now that you can see.

432
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:32,140
Do you hate me so much?

433
00:34:36,057 --> 00:34:37,102
I don't hate you.

434
00:34:39,543 --> 00:34:40,543
I'm mad at you.

435
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:43,457
And I'm hurt.

436
00:34:44,318 --> 00:34:47,499
Like anybody would be, if their big brother betrayed them.

437
00:34:51,084 --> 00:34:52,136
I'm sorry.

438
00:34:59,062 --> 00:35:00,602
Mom was just telling me...

439
00:35:03,352 --> 00:35:05,380
You're Granddad's favorite grandson.

440
00:35:06,758 --> 00:35:08,911
Because you were the first and only boy born into the family,

441
00:35:10,545 --> 00:35:12,202
until I came along.

442
00:35:13,567 --> 00:35:17,377
I couldn't care less about our Grandpa-Granddad thing.

443
00:35:18,019 --> 00:35:19,377
Can you imagine that?

444
00:35:19,878 --> 00:35:21,607
I never even paid it any mind.

445
00:35:22,786 --> 00:35:24,140
All I knew was that...

446
00:35:24,684 --> 00:35:25,684
You're...

447
00:35:27,465 --> 00:35:28,859
You're my big brother.

448
00:35:33,685 --> 00:35:35,807
I never thought they treated me better than you,

449
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,503
or loved me more than you.

450
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:44,179
Not until I couldn't see people's faces, at least.

451
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,100
My dad died.

452
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,413
My mother disappeared.

453
00:35:57,634 --> 00:35:59,062
I couldn't see faces.

454
00:36:00,389 --> 00:36:01,601
At that age,

455
00:36:02,805 --> 00:36:04,139
it wouldn't be strange

456
00:36:04,921 --> 00:36:07,220
that Granddad pushed me more than others, would it?

457
00:36:10,647 --> 00:36:13,299
He just didn't want me to be a burden to anyone.

458
00:36:23,983 --> 00:36:25,607
I'll be really happy

459
00:36:27,714 --> 00:36:29,405
if it's you who takes care of Next.

460
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:36,099
I'll help. I'll do anything for you.

461
00:36:39,804 --> 00:36:42,102
But I won't, if Tanya is in the picture.

462
00:36:50,343 --> 00:36:51,580
Are you Mr. Prapob's family?

463
00:36:55,659 --> 00:36:57,016
Mr. Prapob is conscious now.

464
00:36:57,343 --> 00:36:59,016
But we should remain wary.

465
00:36:59,031 --> 00:37:02,096
I've actually asked him to retire several times before

466
00:37:02,208 --> 00:37:05,705
because stress could affect his condition.

467
00:37:05,851 --> 00:37:06,998
His condition?

468
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:08,536
Mr. Prapob has a heart disease.

469
00:37:08,543 --> 00:37:09,783
You are not aware of this?

470
00:37:10,699 --> 00:37:12,506
He probably doesn't want anyone to worry about him.

471
00:37:13,645 --> 00:37:16,579
His condition has worsened, especially within the last couple of years.

472
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:18,019
How about this?

473
00:37:18,022 --> 00:37:22,497
Mr. Prapob is already in his room, and wants to see his family.

474
00:37:22,733 --> 00:37:24,133
I suggest you stay with him for now.

475
00:37:24,146 --> 00:37:26,496
We can discuss this matter afterwards.

476
00:37:34,801 --> 00:37:36,207
I'm sorry.

477
00:37:37,605 --> 00:37:39,620
It's all my fault things turn out this way.

478
00:37:39,762 --> 00:37:40,909
Dad.

479
00:37:43,691 --> 00:37:46,177
I can't make you realize

480
00:37:49,179 --> 00:37:51,179
how much I love you all the same.

481
00:37:54,877 --> 00:37:58,407
It's my fault that an aunt couldn't love her nephew.

482
00:38:01,142 --> 00:38:04,103
It's my fault that two cousins fought.

483
00:38:06,663 --> 00:38:08,057
Everyone fell apart.

484
00:38:08,866 --> 00:38:13,500
And now a stranger is taking over our company.

485
00:38:18,954 --> 00:38:22,860
A total stranger evicting me from my own company!

486
00:38:23,105 --> 00:38:24,105
Dad.

487
00:38:24,962 --> 00:38:26,459
Please don't work yourself up, Granddad.

488
00:38:27,364 --> 00:38:32,742
I promise you I won't allow it to happen.

489
00:38:38,176 --> 00:38:39,340
Non and I...

490
00:38:43,317 --> 00:38:45,899
We won't let anyone do such a thing.

491
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:48,090
Vee's right.

492
00:38:48,345 --> 00:38:49,939
Please focus on getting better, Grandpa.

493
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:52,620
We'll make sure to make things right.

494
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,111
I'll stay with your grandfather.

495
00:38:58,361 --> 00:38:59,708
You two should go.

496
00:39:00,946 --> 00:39:04,899
Find a way to fix this.

497
00:39:07,817 --> 00:39:10,604
Please take a rest, Dad.

498
00:39:11,136 --> 00:39:12,982
I will be right here with you.

499
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:28,977
How is your grandfather?

500
00:39:29,013 --> 00:39:30,411
He's more or less alright.

501
00:39:30,651 --> 00:39:32,697
Yes. But he still needs a lot of rest.

502
00:39:33,265 --> 00:39:34,385
What a relief.

503
00:39:34,691 --> 00:39:37,005
Vee, we need to talk about Next tonight.

504
00:39:37,339 --> 00:39:38,696
I have something to tell you.

505
00:39:38,986 --> 00:39:39,702
Alright.

506
00:39:39,715 --> 00:39:40,583
That's good, actually.

507
00:39:40,601 --> 00:39:42,405
We need to come up with a way to turn the table on her.

508
00:39:43,168 --> 00:39:43,968
Well—

509
00:39:43,979 --> 00:39:45,506
Have Mirin take your car.

510
00:39:46,025 --> 00:39:47,108
I'll go with you.

511
00:39:49,383 --> 00:39:50,539
Drive carefully, alright?

512
00:39:50,767 --> 00:39:51,902
Text me when you get home.

513
00:39:55,328 --> 00:39:56,462
You're so cool!

514
00:39:58,745 --> 00:40:02,800
You look like a brother superhero duo who's about to kick some bad guys' butts.

515
00:40:05,502 --> 00:40:07,634
I'll be here rooting for you,

516
00:40:07,699 --> 00:40:10,213
and I'll help you both in any way I can,

517
00:40:10,234 --> 00:40:11,460
starting tomorrow.

518
00:40:12,534 --> 00:40:14,459
Do your best, my heart.

519
00:40:22,474 --> 00:40:25,737
I'm sure Granddad loves us both equally.

520
00:40:26,071 --> 00:40:27,308
But Mirin?

521
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:30,182
She has no place in her heart for anyone but me.

522
00:40:41,253 --> 00:40:46,537
It was Tanya who had Manit and Maewkwak leak those users' data.

523
00:40:46,548 --> 00:40:47,548
What?

524
00:40:47,573 --> 00:40:48,674
And you let her?

525
00:40:48,685 --> 00:40:49,531
Easy there, bud.

526
00:40:49,545 --> 00:40:50,608
I didn't know.

527
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:52,506
I swear I didn't.

528
00:40:54,029 --> 00:40:58,542
Like I would ever discredit our company with such a dirty scheme.

529
00:40:58,826 --> 00:41:01,010
How could I, when we've worked our asses off for this?

530
00:41:03,509 --> 00:41:04,509
In our defense,

531
00:41:04,968 --> 00:41:08,420
both Mom and I really didn't think Tanya would do such a thing.

532
00:41:11,674 --> 00:41:13,377
You got any proof?

533
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:14,820
I have Manit and Maewkwak.

534
00:41:15,128 --> 00:41:18,204
They were extorting me for some bonuses all so shamelessly.

535
00:41:20,355 --> 00:41:21,823
Did they lose their minds?

536
00:41:22,411 --> 00:41:25,219
It must have been quite a blow to Tanya's ego when you turned her down.

537
00:41:27,755 --> 00:41:29,908
That's probably why she's going on a rampage right now.

538
00:41:35,265 --> 00:41:37,108
We should keep our guards up

539
00:41:39,349 --> 00:41:43,103
because I don't think someone like her would stop at this.

540
00:41:44,346 --> 00:41:46,005
What do you mean?

541
00:41:48,731 --> 00:41:53,605
I'm afraid she won't hesitate to thoroughly squash us,

542
00:41:54,934 --> 00:41:57,309
and take Next as her own, like Granddad said.

Hey there, my very talented favorite journalist.

545
00:42:10,977 --> 00:42:14,817
Oh, you know me too well, bestie, if you can tell right away I have a favor to ask.

546
00:42:15,171 --> 00:42:17,114
But I'm not just asking you, you know?

547
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:19,404
I'll give you something for the trouble, like usual.

548
00:42:20,305 --> 00:42:25,308
I want you to write something about how Next won't likely compensate for the leak.

549
00:42:26,746 --> 00:42:28,348
No one will sue you.

550
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:33,811
It's not a lie if they really didn't take any actions after promising they would.

551
00:42:35,471 --> 00:42:39,699
You're just speeding up the process of justice as a journalist.

552
00:42:42,653 --> 00:42:44,699
Maybe come up with something that might...

553
00:42:45,034 --> 00:42:48,139
make a few hundred people show up to protest in front of their office.

554
00:42:49,936 --> 00:42:53,102
I'm sick of Chanon's hesitation.

555
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,979
I don't want to wait anymore.

556
00:42:57,712 --> 00:43:01,499
Get this done for me as soon as possible, and I'll wire you the reward.

557
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:16,170
(Share Purchase Agreement)

558
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:33,244
People affected by the leaked data incident are showing up outside of Next Innovation.

559
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:34,705
I think Tanya has started.

560
00:43:34,949 --> 00:43:36,103
What are we waiting for, then?

561
00:43:36,743 --> 00:43:39,152
I'm afraid I can't take action in Chanon's place

562
00:43:39,164 --> 00:43:40,748
since I am not the CEO of the company.

563
00:43:40,779 --> 00:43:44,094
But it is not too late for you all to vote for me to be in charge.

564
00:43:44,491 --> 00:43:47,499
If they work together, there's nothing to worry about.

565
00:43:47,509 --> 00:43:50,099
We will all make you proud, Grandpa.

566
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:52,687
I know this might make you feel uncomfortable,

567
00:43:52,696 --> 00:43:55,469
but I want her to be a part of our family again.

568
00:43:58,373 --> 00:43:59,644
Neeraaumpan.
