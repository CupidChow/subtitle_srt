1
00:00:29,382 --> 00:00:33,386
Another storm has come in
again along with the others

2
00:00:33,637 --> 00:00:37,422
variety of flood control
corruption now in the Philippines.

3
00:00:37,555 --> 00:00:39,534
So now, in a bit
we'll be revisiting

4
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:41,728
the Blue Ribbon
Committee hearing.

5
00:00:41,817 --> 00:00:44,494
as well as Typhoon Dodong's
entry to the PAR.

6
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,014
I don’t know why
I even came home.

7
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:03,969
Bummer.

8
00:01:04,737 --> 00:01:05,905
Just a little rain.

9
00:01:06,322 --> 00:01:08,282
And the drainage is already full.

10
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,252
It’s flooded again.

11
00:01:21,988 --> 00:01:26,284
All the trash, gets swept away
by the water into the alleys.

12
00:01:27,044 --> 00:01:29,588
There really are no
secrets to hide here.

13
00:02:28,744 --> 00:02:30,198
Hey, what are you doing?

14
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:32,432
I told you to take
me home already.

15
00:02:32,547 --> 00:02:33,715
Why are we here?

16
00:02:34,218 --> 00:02:35,569
Just stay here for now.

17
00:02:35,675 --> 00:02:36,926
You were gone so long.

18
00:02:37,414 --> 00:02:38,914
And you’re soaking wet.

19
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,877
Wow, concerned, huh?

20
00:02:41,926 --> 00:02:43,052
Of course.

21
00:03:38,622 --> 00:03:39,706
Boss, thanks.

22
00:03:39,731 --> 00:03:40,793
Wait for me in a bit.

23
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:41,990
Just a moment.

24
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,370
- Come on.
- Bye.

25
00:03:45,371 --> 00:03:47,264
- No. I’m already here.
- Come on, just a kiss.

26
00:03:47,289 --> 00:03:49,665
- There, you got left by the tricycle.
- Just one, come on. Just one.

27
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,126
- No. Next time, okay?
- Just one. Promise.

28
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,527
Come on, just one. Just one.

29
00:03:52,743 --> 00:03:53,753
Next time.

30
00:03:53,754 --> 00:03:54,963
- Hurry up.
- Cut it out.

31
00:04:01,317 --> 00:04:02,360
Bye-bye.

32
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,680
Hey.

33
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:13,400
Woah!

34
00:04:13,693 --> 00:04:16,209
- Auntie Aning!
- My God, Sarah!

35
00:04:16,234 --> 00:04:17,652
What's up with you?

36
00:04:18,254 --> 00:04:19,504
What time is it?

37
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:22,426
Why didn’t you tell anyone
you’re going home today?

38
00:04:22,451 --> 00:04:24,450
- You, Auntie Anne. I just arrived.
- This kid, really!

39
00:04:24,474 --> 00:04:25,976
You’re so sullen right away.

40
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,704
This lady.

41
00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:29,521
Be thankful you're
my favorite niece.

42
00:04:30,164 --> 00:04:31,499
- Where’s Mom?
- Huh?

43
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:32,708
Mom?

44
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,978
Ah, have you eaten?

45
00:04:35,003 --> 00:04:36,545
I’ll get you something.

46
00:04:37,178 --> 00:04:39,090
I really missed
being here at home.

47
00:04:46,046 --> 00:04:49,851
Oh, why is Dad’s candle not lit?

48
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:51,144
Oh, well.

49
00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:53,837
Maybe your mom
just forgot to light it up.

50
00:04:55,064 --> 00:04:56,149
Hi, Dad.

51
00:04:57,317 --> 00:04:58,401
I missed you, Dad.

52
00:05:01,171 --> 00:05:02,338
Does Mom not know I’m here?

53
00:05:02,363 --> 00:05:03,966
- I was just going to surprise her.
- Oh, uh, don’t.

54
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,617
- Oh, don’t. Oh dear.
- Don’t, I’ll go look for her.

55
00:05:05,641 --> 00:05:07,392
Wait, wait, Sarah.

56
00:05:13,794 --> 00:05:14,794
Oh?

57
00:05:15,501 --> 00:05:17,837
Since when did
Mom start locking up?

58
00:05:18,254 --> 00:05:20,048
Your mom has a guest.

59
00:05:20,649 --> 00:05:22,525
I want to sleep
with her, wake her up.

60
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:25,260
Oh no, not now.
Go to sleep. Go into your room.

61
00:05:25,285 --> 00:05:28,072
But I want to be beside Mom.
I missed Mom.

62
00:05:28,097 --> 00:05:31,476
Take a bath first and then go
sleep in your room afterward, okay?

63
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:40,814
Sarah!

64
00:06:41,647 --> 00:06:43,314
So you’re back, dear.

65
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:46,174
You didn’t even tell me.

66
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,993
I could’ve picked you up, right?

67
00:06:48,153 --> 00:06:50,029
It was supposed to
be a surprise, Mom.

68
00:06:50,054 --> 00:06:51,304
Oh, really?

69
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:53,832
Oh you, you don't need
to surprise me.

70
00:06:54,692 --> 00:06:56,479
Hi. Good morning,
are you Sarah?

71
00:06:57,645 --> 00:06:59,022
By the way,

72
00:06:59,147 --> 00:07:00,356
this is Michael.

73
00:07:00,523 --> 00:07:01,524
My boyfriend.

74
00:07:02,358 --> 00:07:04,696
Boyfriend? You hurt my feelings.

75
00:07:05,028 --> 00:07:06,863
You haven’t even
told your daughter

76
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:08,507
that I'm going
to marry your mom.

77
00:07:08,531 --> 00:07:09,574
Oh come on.

78
00:07:11,492 --> 00:07:14,595
You're so sweet. So, that's
why I love you so much, Beb.

79
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,539
- I love you too.
- Go eat now.

80
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,664
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

81
00:07:17,665 --> 00:07:19,843
- You cooked again.
- Go on, eat already.

82
00:07:27,735 --> 00:07:29,110
Sorry, Beb, okay?

83
00:07:29,135 --> 00:07:31,054
I’ll handle this. Sarah!

84
00:07:31,562 --> 00:07:32,562
Sarah!

85
00:07:34,265 --> 00:07:35,266
Sarah!

86
00:07:36,367 --> 00:07:37,367
Dear!

87
00:07:40,855 --> 00:07:42,565
What's up with you, dear?

88
00:07:42,727 --> 00:07:43,936
Who’s that, Mom?

89
00:07:44,075 --> 00:07:45,902
I was only at Grandma’s
for two months.

90
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,154
You already found a boyfriend.

91
00:07:48,585 --> 00:07:50,295
And you’re really
getting married?

92
00:07:51,324 --> 00:07:53,326
You forgot Dad so fast, Mom.

93
00:07:55,258 --> 00:07:56,258
Dear,

94
00:07:56,538 --> 00:07:59,373
you know how much
I loved your dad.

95
00:08:00,249 --> 00:08:02,251
But he’s gone now, right?

96
00:08:03,812 --> 00:08:05,271
And you even left me too.

97
00:08:05,296 --> 00:08:07,715
Of course I got lonely.

98
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:09,730
Why?

99
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,366
Is Michael a comedian, Mom?

100
00:08:11,803 --> 00:08:12,803
Oh, stop that.

101
00:08:13,147 --> 00:08:14,679
You’re being sarcastic.

102
00:08:15,176 --> 00:08:20,598
Michael’s kind, thoughtful,
and has his own business.

103
00:08:21,187 --> 00:08:22,814
And even before,

104
00:08:23,123 --> 00:08:24,499
Aning used to be so mad at him.

105
00:08:24,524 --> 00:08:26,751
But now, Aning
loves him so much.

106
00:08:26,776 --> 00:08:29,153
Come on, don’t be like that.

107
00:08:29,362 --> 00:08:30,780
So where did you meet him, Mom?

108
00:08:31,656 --> 00:08:33,616
Of course, here.

109
00:08:33,801 --> 00:08:35,593
At our eatery.

110
00:08:35,618 --> 00:08:37,521
- Oh, Mom.
- Come on.

111
00:08:38,694 --> 00:08:39,902
Look.

112
00:08:39,997 --> 00:08:41,207
You know,

113
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,960
you’ll always be my first love.

114
00:08:44,064 --> 00:08:45,104
Oh, Mom.

115
00:08:45,129 --> 00:08:46,921
Just make sure
you’re happy, okay?

116
00:08:47,421 --> 00:08:48,421
Yes.

117
00:08:51,968 --> 00:08:53,719
Alright, Mom. I’ll try.

118
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,931
As long as you’re happy.
You know I’m always happy too.

119
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,682
Michael, come here.

120
00:08:58,707 --> 00:09:00,333
Sarah already agreed.

121
00:09:01,811 --> 00:09:02,811
Sarah,

122
00:09:03,154 --> 00:09:06,023
I’ll formally introduce
Michael to you.

123
00:09:07,275 --> 00:09:08,568
Michael, this is Sarah.

124
00:09:11,562 --> 00:09:13,207
Come on, dear.

125
00:09:16,409 --> 00:09:18,717
Just don’t you dare hurt my mom.

126
00:09:18,761 --> 00:09:20,054
I love her so much.

127
00:09:20,621 --> 00:09:22,081
Of course not, even now,

128
00:09:22,285 --> 00:09:23,325
I’m already scared of you.

129
00:09:25,835 --> 00:09:27,753
Just let your mom be.

130
00:09:29,797 --> 00:09:32,592
Of course, she’s just looking
for something to keep her busy.

131
00:09:34,552 --> 00:09:36,012
Hey, what do you mean busy?

132
00:09:36,103 --> 00:09:38,914
Nick, we’re talking
about her boyfriend, okay?

133
00:09:39,148 --> 00:09:40,349
Not a card game.

134
00:09:40,688 --> 00:09:42,435
That’s why, let her be.

135
00:09:42,977 --> 00:09:44,770
Who knows, you
might even get a sibling.

136
00:09:44,937 --> 00:09:45,937
Right?

137
00:09:46,439 --> 00:09:47,815
Dad, did you hear that?

138
00:09:48,441 --> 00:09:50,693
She wants to give
me a sibling, Dad.

139
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,014
Why not?

140
00:09:52,106 --> 00:09:53,649
Your mom’s still young.

141
00:09:54,423 --> 00:09:56,278
If you don’t want that,

142
00:09:56,357 --> 00:09:57,957
then maybe give her
a grandchild instead.

143
00:09:58,484 --> 00:09:59,618
Idiot!

144
00:10:00,036 --> 00:10:01,495
Nick, stop with
that kind of joke.

145
00:10:02,883 --> 00:10:04,457
I still want to get my diploma.

146
00:10:07,335 --> 00:10:08,335
Back to school again?

147
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:10,943
That’s good.

148
00:10:11,252 --> 00:10:12,612
You look good
when you’re studying.

149
00:10:13,892 --> 00:10:14,892
You?

150
00:10:15,718 --> 00:10:16,718
Not anymore.

151
00:10:17,013 --> 00:10:18,640
I’m not as smart as you are.

152
00:10:19,855 --> 00:10:20,855
And besides,

153
00:10:21,015 --> 00:10:22,475
I already have a job.

154
00:10:22,808 --> 00:10:23,976
If you think about it,

155
00:10:24,477 --> 00:10:25,811
I could already provide for you.

156
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,565
If only your sexy
mom wouldn’t kill me,

157
00:10:30,324 --> 00:10:31,409
I would’ve eloped with you.

158
00:10:33,305 --> 00:10:34,305
Crazy!

159
00:10:35,536 --> 00:10:37,087
I’ll tell my dad,

160
00:10:37,112 --> 00:10:39,242
he’ll definitely haunt you.
Right, Dad?

161
00:10:39,383 --> 00:10:40,383
Hey.

162
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,676
You, really— I was just joking.

163
00:10:42,745 --> 00:10:44,664
Uncle, I was just joking, okay?

164
00:10:44,689 --> 00:10:46,249
Please don’t take it seriously.

165
00:10:52,763 --> 00:10:55,003
This cable again. I think the
bottom part’s broken again.

166
00:11:04,725 --> 00:11:05,725
Hey!

167
00:11:07,186 --> 00:11:09,355
- Where are you going?
- You! What’s that?

168
00:11:09,681 --> 00:11:11,524
- This shit can't run.
- Stay right there!

169
00:11:12,275 --> 00:11:13,275
Stay right there!

170
00:11:13,776 --> 00:11:15,027
So he was a thief.

171
00:11:15,188 --> 00:11:16,194
You there!

172
00:11:16,195 --> 00:11:17,195
Come here!

173
00:11:18,114 --> 00:11:19,114
- Don’t!
- What?

174
00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:20,448
- Don’t! Please don’t!
- Huh?

175
00:11:20,473 --> 00:11:22,392
- Psst, psst, hey!
- What are you two doing?

176
00:11:23,135 --> 00:11:24,260
Boss, boss.

177
00:11:24,285 --> 00:11:25,452
Hey, boss!

178
00:11:25,496 --> 00:11:26,746
There are lots of people, boss.
Calm down.

179
00:11:26,747 --> 00:11:28,083
- Hey, what’s that?
- It’s just a toy gun.

180
00:11:28,107 --> 00:11:30,501
- Calm down, calm down.
- Come on, bro. Let’s go!

181
00:11:40,805 --> 00:11:41,821
Hello, Beb?

182
00:11:41,846 --> 00:11:42,846
Hello, Beb.

183
00:11:43,446 --> 00:11:45,675
- You missed me already, huh?
- Of course.

184
00:11:46,017 --> 00:11:48,102
I’m still here at the eatery.

185
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,729
It’s raining so hard here.
How about there?

186
00:11:50,754 --> 00:11:54,400
I was going to ask
you to pick up Sarah.

187
00:11:54,425 --> 00:11:56,741
She might have a
hard time getting a ride.

188
00:11:57,434 --> 00:11:59,228
Oh Beb, I’m busy here.

189
00:11:59,611 --> 00:12:00,987
Please?

190
00:12:01,193 --> 00:12:02,611
Oh, okay okay.
I’ll take care of it.

191
00:12:02,742 --> 00:12:05,703
You're too kind.
That's why I love you so much!

192
00:12:06,246 --> 00:12:07,788
Alright. Take care, okay?

193
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:11,379
Wait, wait.

194
00:12:11,468 --> 00:12:12,640
There’s such a long line.

195
00:12:17,757 --> 00:12:22,053
[Pick me up?]

196
00:12:27,441 --> 00:12:28,441
What's up?

197
00:12:28,777 --> 00:12:29,777
Here.

198
00:12:29,866 --> 00:12:30,866
Hurry up.

199
00:12:31,062 --> 00:12:32,182
Bro, have you seen the boss?

200
00:12:32,342 --> 00:12:33,649
I was about to leave.

201
00:12:33,773 --> 00:12:34,815
I don’t see him, bro.

202
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:37,568
Damn, such a hassle.

203
00:12:40,654 --> 00:12:41,654
Sarah!

204
00:12:42,549 --> 00:12:44,550
- Get in.
- Oh, Mr. Michael.

205
00:12:44,575 --> 00:12:45,852
Why are you here?

206
00:12:45,877 --> 00:12:47,370
Your mom asked
me to pick you up.

207
00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:51,128
Oh, that’s okay.
I’ll just commute.

208
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:52,278
No.

209
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:53,627
There aren’t many jeeps here.

210
00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:54,771
And it’s raining really hard.

211
00:12:54,795 --> 00:12:56,170
Your mom will get mad
if I don’t fetch you.

212
00:12:56,194 --> 00:12:57,194
Come on.

213
00:12:58,593 --> 00:12:59,593
Get in.

214
00:13:17,598 --> 00:13:18,608
That’s so pretty.

215
00:13:18,609 --> 00:13:19,919
Here, look.

216
00:13:20,194 --> 00:13:23,072
Hi, what’s the gossip?

217
00:13:25,157 --> 00:13:26,742
So pretty!

218
00:13:27,118 --> 00:13:28,702
You’re so extra.

219
00:13:29,088 --> 00:13:30,955
Oh, that’s really nice.

220
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,998
Hey, who are you chatting with?

221
00:13:33,082 --> 00:13:34,500
Oh, bro? Almost done fighting?

222
00:13:34,893 --> 00:13:36,143
Hi!

223
00:13:36,168 --> 00:13:38,270
Wow, that looks delicious.

224
00:13:38,295 --> 00:13:39,463
- Hello!
- You texted, and then...

225
00:13:39,487 --> 00:13:41,489
So pretty.

226
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:44,593
Where’s daddy?

227
00:13:44,927 --> 00:13:46,137
I don’t know.

228
00:13:49,827 --> 00:13:52,281
Oh, daddy’s not here.

229
00:13:54,645 --> 00:13:56,364
Add some of that, that one.

230
00:13:56,389 --> 00:13:57,730
There!

231
00:13:58,065 --> 00:13:59,900
Umm...

232
00:14:00,484 --> 00:14:01,986
Hi, Nick.

233
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,387
Can you come with
me to the warehouse?

234
00:14:06,615 --> 00:14:08,117
I’m still doing something.

235
00:14:12,204 --> 00:14:13,706
And I’m going somewhere.

236
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,250
During work hours?

237
00:14:25,593 --> 00:14:27,386
Hey, Nick?
Are you done?

238
00:14:28,762 --> 00:14:29,762
It's wet.

239
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:33,850
How’s school?

240
00:14:34,685 --> 00:14:35,965
- You're doing fine?
- It’s fine.

241
00:14:37,104 --> 00:14:38,224
You didn’t have a hard time?

242
00:14:39,732 --> 00:14:40,732
Not really.

243
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:43,257
It's wet.

244
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,580
Becky!

245
00:14:55,664 --> 00:14:57,124
Your dad might see us.

246
00:14:59,251 --> 00:15:00,678
Do you see him?

247
00:15:01,045 --> 00:15:02,045
No.

248
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,881
Eat while the soup’s still hot.

249
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,379
Thank you.

250
00:18:40,271 --> 00:18:41,539
Maybe you’re shy with me.

251
00:18:41,598 --> 00:18:42,598
Don’t be shy with me.

252
00:18:42,765 --> 00:18:43,765
I’m not your dad.

253
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,028
- But...
- I’m not shy, okay?

254
00:18:49,343 --> 00:18:51,823
Looks like your cellphone’s broken
and you didn’t even notice.

255
00:18:51,855 --> 00:18:53,255
Why are you
letting it be like that?

256
00:18:53,986 --> 00:18:56,155
Ah, this is Mom's old phone.

257
00:19:00,659 --> 00:19:02,499
You know, that’s actually
your mom’s old phone.

258
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:03,703
What if it breaks?

259
00:19:03,961 --> 00:19:05,589
Then you won’t
have a phone at all?

260
00:19:08,073 --> 00:19:09,626
It still works fine.

261
00:19:12,129 --> 00:19:13,129
Who are you talking to?

262
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,380
Your boyfriend?

263
00:19:15,235 --> 00:19:16,451
I’m almost there.

264
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,100
Oh!

265
00:19:20,345 --> 00:19:21,555
Oh, where are you going?

266
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,557
You’re boring.

267
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:26,319
I’m almost done,
I’m about to finish!

268
00:19:26,526 --> 00:19:28,318
So what?

269
00:19:28,346 --> 00:19:29,513
Let me finish first.

270
00:19:29,538 --> 00:19:31,611
Don’t you have your hands, Nick?

271
00:19:41,036 --> 00:19:42,538
We’re going out later.

272
00:19:43,121 --> 00:19:44,121
Where?

273
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:46,796
Just don’t ask, we’re going out.

274
00:19:49,883 --> 00:19:51,258
Hey, is the food good?

275
00:19:51,283 --> 00:19:52,451
So good, ma’am.

276
00:19:52,795 --> 00:19:53,795
Mom!

277
00:19:54,129 --> 00:19:55,922
Hey! Dear!

278
00:19:55,964 --> 00:19:58,509
Oh my!

279
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:00,340
My baby girl!

280
00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:02,467
I missed you, Mom.

281
00:20:03,806 --> 00:20:05,182
- How are you?
- Hello?

282
00:20:06,391 --> 00:20:07,392
Hello, dad.

283
00:20:07,417 --> 00:20:08,453
Dear.

284
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:11,063
My credit card’s maxed out.

285
00:20:12,981 --> 00:20:15,901
Yeah, I wanna eat. I’m craving.

286
00:20:16,202 --> 00:20:17,514
I’ll just send through some cash.

287
00:20:17,538 --> 00:20:19,863
Because I might stay
late here at Vivian’s.

288
00:20:20,322 --> 00:20:22,699
Then you’ll be
sleeping there again.

289
00:20:22,874 --> 00:20:25,752
I barely see you at home, Dad.

290
00:20:25,953 --> 00:20:27,204
I miss you.

291
00:20:27,871 --> 00:20:29,164
We’re just fixing the wedding.

292
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,291
Ah, just relax.

293
00:20:31,885 --> 00:20:34,322
And I told you I'm trying to win
the favor of Vivian's daughter.

294
00:20:34,346 --> 00:20:35,564
Has she arrived?

295
00:20:35,655 --> 00:20:37,405
When will you introduce me?

296
00:20:37,661 --> 00:20:39,466
Relax. You’ll meet her soon.

297
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:42,386
Don’t get too
close to her, okay?

298
00:20:42,845 --> 00:20:45,556
You might love her more than me.

299
00:20:45,764 --> 00:20:48,058
I’m possessive when
it comes to my dad.

300
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,103
You know you’re my
only daughter, right?

301
00:20:53,397 --> 00:20:54,731
Love you, Daddy.

302
00:20:54,976 --> 00:20:55,976
I love you, too.

303
00:20:56,275 --> 00:20:58,277
Michael’s actually not bad, huh?

304
00:20:58,418 --> 00:21:01,213
But earlier his car
almost broke down.

305
00:21:01,381 --> 00:21:04,591
Sorry, it’s because
the car’s old.

306
00:21:04,616 --> 00:21:07,285
But with a little
fixing, it’s fine again.

307
00:21:07,286 --> 00:21:08,787
Just joking, Michael.

308
00:21:09,329 --> 00:21:11,540
What? What do you call him?

309
00:21:12,078 --> 00:21:14,042
Uncle Michael.

310
00:21:14,578 --> 00:21:16,312
- Oh... Mom.
- That’s fine, Beb.

311
00:21:16,337 --> 00:21:17,647
She can call me
whatever she likes.

312
00:21:17,671 --> 00:21:18,797
No, Beb.

313
00:21:19,089 --> 00:21:21,133
What if we’re already married?

314
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,468
She’ll call me mom.

315
00:21:23,844 --> 00:21:26,346
And you, Michael.

316
00:21:26,668 --> 00:21:30,003
Well, who knows. Maybe soon,
she’ll start calling me daddy.

317
00:21:30,058 --> 00:21:32,332
Hey, no way.

318
00:21:32,601 --> 00:21:33,621
Hey, Aning.

319
00:21:33,646 --> 00:21:36,689
Pick me a piece
there with less fat.

320
00:21:36,714 --> 00:21:37,715
I’m on a diet.

321
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,961
Alright, I’ll check
if there’s any left.

322
00:21:40,986 --> 00:21:41,986
Okay.

323
00:21:42,088 --> 00:21:44,673
I want a waistline like Sarah’s.

324
00:21:44,698 --> 00:21:45,824
Why, Mom?

325
00:21:46,074 --> 00:21:48,619
We’re still equally pretty
and sexy, you know.

326
00:21:49,369 --> 00:21:50,662
Oh really?

327
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:52,080
What do you think, Michael?

328
00:21:52,104 --> 00:21:53,104
Is that true?

329
00:21:54,249 --> 00:21:55,834
- Of course.
- See?

330
00:21:56,084 --> 00:21:59,212
That’s why my mom’s so
in love with you, Michael.

331
00:21:59,421 --> 00:22:02,090
You’re quite the
charmer, Michael.

332
00:22:07,179 --> 00:22:08,179
Hey, Beb.

333
00:22:08,579 --> 00:22:11,892
Don’t let Sarah call
you Michael, okay?

334
00:22:13,101 --> 00:22:14,186
It's fine with me.

335
00:22:14,436 --> 00:22:16,021
Don’t overthink it.

336
00:22:17,189 --> 00:22:18,189
No.

337
00:22:18,398 --> 00:22:22,069
Especially since you’ll
be like her second dad.

338
00:22:23,737 --> 00:22:24,737
Right?

339
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:31,763
That’s fine, babe.

340
00:22:31,788 --> 00:22:33,204
I didn’t even mind it.

341
00:22:33,229 --> 00:22:34,469
I’m not even thinking about it.

342
00:22:35,707 --> 00:22:36,707
No.

343
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:37,959
Don't worry.

344
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,753
Sarah will understand
it eventually.

345
00:24:11,386 --> 00:24:13,388
[See you at the usual place.]

346
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,310
Come on.

347
00:24:19,311 --> 00:24:20,311
Wait.

348
00:24:20,479 --> 00:24:21,980
Where… where are we?

349
00:24:22,825 --> 00:24:23,910
What’s going on?

350
00:24:23,935 --> 00:24:25,768
Who are you even texting?

351
00:24:25,793 --> 00:24:27,627
Ah, Horace.

352
00:24:27,673 --> 00:24:29,393
He’s just looking for
something at the shop.

353
00:24:30,089 --> 00:24:31,381
Hi!

354
00:24:31,406 --> 00:24:33,341
Hi, guys!

355
00:24:33,366 --> 00:24:34,450
Hi, Faith!

356
00:24:34,475 --> 00:24:36,143
Hi, Cassie and John.

357
00:24:36,661 --> 00:24:38,112
- This is Nick. Sit down.
- Hi!

358
00:24:38,137 --> 00:24:39,205
Welcome to my bar.
Sit down, sit down.

359
00:24:39,206 --> 00:24:40,457
- Yeah.
- Sit down. Enjoy yourself.

360
00:24:40,458 --> 00:24:41,541
Sit down.

361
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,076
Is he your boyfriend?

362
00:24:46,088 --> 00:24:47,740
Boyfriend? No way.

363
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:49,716
- No way.
- Fubu?

364
00:24:49,883 --> 00:24:51,050
Fuck buddies.

365
00:24:51,051 --> 00:24:52,306
Friends with benefits.

366
00:24:52,844 --> 00:24:55,706
Cassie, stop teasing Nick already.

367
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:59,809
Then why isn’t he talking?

368
00:25:00,086 --> 00:25:01,843
Is he mute or what?

369
00:25:02,187 --> 00:25:03,562
He’s got a tongue.

370
00:25:03,587 --> 00:25:05,381
That’s exactly why
he’s with me, right?

371
00:25:07,562 --> 00:25:09,480
Wait, wait. Excuse me.

372
00:25:10,737 --> 00:25:12,280
I’ll just buy cigarettes.

373
00:25:12,823 --> 00:25:13,824
Yeah, wait.

374
00:25:14,324 --> 00:25:16,827
He’s not even your boyfriend.

375
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,037
Where did your lover boy go?

376
00:25:19,621 --> 00:25:21,539
Just let him be.
Let's just enjoy.

377
00:25:21,564 --> 00:25:24,066
And maybe dance later.

378
00:25:24,167 --> 00:25:25,919
- Okay.
- Cheers!

379
00:25:54,614 --> 00:25:56,012
Sorry, I was late.

380
00:25:57,534 --> 00:25:59,035
I had to close up the shop.

381
00:25:59,453 --> 00:26:00,746
What do you do now?

382
00:26:00,782 --> 00:26:03,331
Just some side jobs at a motor shop.

383
00:26:05,041 --> 00:26:06,126
Boss, one beer, please.

384
00:26:07,644 --> 00:26:08,684
You, do you want anything?

385
00:26:10,005 --> 00:26:11,005
I still have one.

386
00:26:13,175 --> 00:26:14,175
Thank you.

387
00:26:14,551 --> 00:26:17,304
What’s up? Why did you
suddenly want to meet?

388
00:26:17,675 --> 00:26:19,135
I’m getting sick
of staying at home.

389
00:26:19,837 --> 00:26:20,837
Sick of it?

390
00:26:21,197 --> 00:26:22,285
Where’d you even learn that?

391
00:26:22,309 --> 00:26:24,436
And who taught
you to talk like that?

392
00:26:25,145 --> 00:26:27,063
It's my mom's boyfriend.

393
00:26:27,413 --> 00:26:29,445
He even sleeps
over at our house.

394
00:26:31,443 --> 00:26:33,612
He even beats me
to sleeping there.

395
00:26:33,962 --> 00:26:35,447
It should’ve been me first.

396
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,072
You know, sometimes,

397
00:26:37,073 --> 00:26:39,409
I wonder why I even talk to you.

398
00:26:39,618 --> 00:26:41,871
Even a dog’s easier
to talk to than you.

399
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:44,289
Arf, arf, arf!

400
00:26:47,042 --> 00:26:48,418
You’re so sensitive.

401
00:26:49,502 --> 00:26:52,130
I thought you said you’d give
your mom’s boyfriend a chance?

402
00:26:53,537 --> 00:26:55,271
That’s what pisses me off.

403
00:26:55,458 --> 00:26:56,468
Can you imagine,

404
00:26:56,469 --> 00:26:59,804
I can even hear them
having sex in the next room.

405
00:27:00,854 --> 00:27:02,355
Watch your mouth.

406
00:27:02,682 --> 00:27:03,683
Don’t tell me,

407
00:27:04,017 --> 00:27:05,518
you learned that from me, huh?

408
00:27:06,269 --> 00:27:08,309
Isn’t it obvious you were
the first one to touch me?

409
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:24,871
Dear,

410
00:27:25,675 --> 00:27:27,193
wake up.

411
00:27:31,711 --> 00:27:34,626
Dear, wake up.

412
00:27:34,689 --> 00:27:35,899
What time is it, Mom?

413
00:27:35,924 --> 00:27:37,373
It’s already nine.

414
00:27:37,398 --> 00:27:39,511
Michael’s been waiting
downstairs for a while.

415
00:27:40,029 --> 00:27:41,154
Come on, get up.

416
00:27:41,179 --> 00:27:43,848
No, I’m not coming.

417
00:27:44,349 --> 00:27:46,017
Hey, Sarah.

418
00:27:46,142 --> 00:27:47,394
Come on, get up.

419
00:27:47,727 --> 00:27:49,728
- No.
- Come on.

420
00:27:49,729 --> 00:27:51,481
Okay, fine, I’ll get ready.

421
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:54,818
Dad,

422
00:27:55,151 --> 00:27:57,320
I want that gown.

423
00:27:57,463 --> 00:28:00,382
But it’s a bit loose here.

424
00:28:00,407 --> 00:28:02,701
Maybe we can have it adjusted?

425
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:07,080
Alright, just tell
the tailor to fix it.

426
00:28:07,414 --> 00:28:09,708
- And we’ll pick up the gown.
- Okay.

427
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,543
Hi, Beb.

428
00:28:11,817 --> 00:28:12,918
Beb.

429
00:28:13,211 --> 00:28:15,088
Sorry, we’re late.

430
00:28:15,297 --> 00:28:18,049
Because Sarah here,
was so hard to wake up.

431
00:28:18,425 --> 00:28:19,843
Sarah, this is Becky.

432
00:28:19,987 --> 00:28:21,380
Michael’s daughter.

433
00:28:21,946 --> 00:28:24,448
- Hi, I’m Becky.
- Hello.

434
00:28:24,473 --> 00:28:27,167
Dad said you just got
back from vacation.

435
00:28:27,225 --> 00:28:29,226
Where’d you go? Tokyo?

436
00:28:29,251 --> 00:28:30,321
Korea?

437
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:31,888
Boracay?

438
00:28:32,522 --> 00:28:33,896
Just at my grandpa’s place.

439
00:28:34,065 --> 00:28:36,067
In Cabanatuan.

440
00:28:36,794 --> 00:28:40,255
Ah, in Luzon.

441
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,449
Wow, that’s nice. How was it?

442
00:28:42,574 --> 00:28:44,159
How was your vacation?

443
00:28:44,409 --> 00:28:45,660
And how old are you now?

444
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:47,287
Do you have a boyfriend?

445
00:28:47,662 --> 00:28:50,081
Um, do you smoke?

446
00:28:50,373 --> 00:28:51,750
Do you drink?

447
00:28:51,969 --> 00:28:53,168
What do you do?

448
00:28:53,296 --> 00:28:55,673
Baby, stop asking
Sarah so many questions.

449
00:28:55,754 --> 00:28:57,505
She might still be half-asleep.

450
00:28:58,223 --> 00:29:00,592
Just let them bond. Come on.

451
00:29:01,009 --> 00:29:02,217
That’s true.

452
00:29:02,242 --> 00:29:03,242
And also,

453
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:06,139
Auntie, can we go clubbing,
Sarah and I?

454
00:29:06,431 --> 00:29:08,640
I’ll introduce
you to my friends.

455
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:09,873
Ah.

456
00:29:10,894 --> 00:29:11,894
Sure.

457
00:29:12,246 --> 00:29:13,748
Perfect. What’s your IG?

458
00:29:13,773 --> 00:29:14,980
Let’s connect.

459
00:29:14,981 --> 00:29:16,207
Vivian!

460
00:29:16,232 --> 00:29:18,485
- Oh, Choleng.
- Oh, here.

461
00:29:18,573 --> 00:29:21,157
Satin, and Mikado.

462
00:29:21,182 --> 00:29:22,821
Ah, this one’s nice.

463
00:29:22,846 --> 00:29:24,932
Beautiful, it really
suits her, right?

464
00:29:25,036 --> 00:29:27,951
But the fabric feels easy
to get hot.

465
00:29:27,952 --> 00:29:32,664
And it’s so white, I might
look like I work in a hospital.

466
00:29:32,665 --> 00:29:33,921
Hey, that’s what’s
“in” right now!

467
00:29:33,945 --> 00:29:34,959
Really?

468
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,502
- Yeah!
- Isn’t there...

469
00:29:36,503 --> 00:29:37,524
- Dirty white?
- Anyways...

470
00:29:37,548 --> 00:29:41,757
Nice meeting you,
my future sister.

471
00:29:41,758 --> 00:29:43,884
- See you around.
- Oh, so dirty white is okay?

472
00:29:43,885 --> 00:29:46,262
- Dad. Auntie.
- Bye.

473
00:29:46,263 --> 00:29:47,971
- Okay, take care.
- I’ll go now.

474
00:29:47,972 --> 00:29:48,972
- Beb.
- Dad.

475
00:29:49,849 --> 00:29:51,225
Bye, Dad.

476
00:29:51,226 --> 00:29:53,074
- Alright, take care.
- Bye, Auntie.

477
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:54,156
- Bye, Sarah.
- Okay.

478
00:29:54,181 --> 00:29:56,689
See you. Bye, Daddy, enjoy!

479
00:29:57,365 --> 00:29:59,576
Your daughter’s
really sweet, huh?

480
00:30:01,403 --> 00:30:02,737
Oh, by the way, Choleng.

481
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,080
Where’s Sarah’s dress?

482
00:30:04,131 --> 00:30:05,674
Oh, it’s over there
in the dressing room.

483
00:30:05,698 --> 00:30:07,117
- Just go inside.
- Go on now.

484
00:30:07,142 --> 00:30:08,618
- Alright, Mom.
- Go ahead, dear.

485
00:30:08,643 --> 00:30:10,602
That one’s nice,
it really suits you.

486
00:30:12,122 --> 00:30:14,124
- Does it?
- Yeah.

487
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,976
- But I think it suits her more…
- The one meant for you.

488
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,242
Is this the gray one?
It looks good with pants, right?

489
00:30:18,267 --> 00:30:19,351
Beb, this suits you.

490
00:30:19,376 --> 00:30:20,460
It matches her color.

491
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,006
Oh, look, quickly now.

492
00:30:22,143 --> 00:30:23,733
Oh my, what’s that?

493
00:30:23,758 --> 00:30:25,332
There’s a lot more here.

494
00:30:25,357 --> 00:30:26,823
- Let me see.
- So you can check them all...

495
00:30:26,847 --> 00:30:28,014
There.

496
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:29,055
- Wow.
- Nice.

497
00:30:29,056 --> 00:30:30,056
Oh, this gray one.

498
00:30:30,057 --> 00:30:32,124
Oh, by the way.
How much for everything?

499
00:30:32,267 --> 00:30:34,269
You’re in such a hurry!

500
00:30:34,329 --> 00:30:35,936
But I already made
a quotation for it.

501
00:30:35,937 --> 00:30:37,104
Oh, here.

502
00:30:37,129 --> 00:30:38,540
See?

503
00:30:38,565 --> 00:30:41,400
- That’s so expensive, Choleng.
- Come on now.

504
00:30:41,425 --> 00:30:42,509
Lower the price.

505
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,212
It already has a big discount.

506
00:30:44,237 --> 00:30:46,820
Oh, come on, me?
You’re overcharging me?

507
00:32:16,222 --> 00:32:18,556
Here, this one.
This is your favorite vegetable.

508
00:32:18,581 --> 00:32:19,666
Oh. So you’re here.

509
00:32:19,667 --> 00:32:21,185
- You take over here.
- This is your favorite.

510
00:32:21,209 --> 00:32:22,376
- It’s so crowded.
- What’s with you?

511
00:32:22,377 --> 00:32:23,919
- How are you guys doing? Are you okay?
- Oh my goodness.

512
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,171
Alright then.
It's crazy, my God.

513
00:32:26,172 --> 00:32:27,359
What happened?

514
00:32:27,384 --> 00:32:28,425
Oh my god.

515
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:31,277
I don't like that very much.

516
00:32:31,302 --> 00:32:33,304
- How’s your order?
- Oh, that’s their usual here.

517
00:32:33,329 --> 00:32:35,098
- They always order different things.
- Alright, go ahead and eat.

518
00:32:35,122 --> 00:32:36,864
Goodness gracious.

519
00:32:37,225 --> 00:32:39,602
Sir, I’ll order this one,
and maybe that one too.

520
00:32:39,688 --> 00:32:40,688
Thanks!

521
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,084
Yeah.

522
00:32:42,109 --> 00:32:43,109
I’ll be back.

523
00:32:43,565 --> 00:32:45,649
- Go.
- You’re always here, huh?

524
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:47,651
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.

525
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:53,675
Ah, Vivian, by the way we still have
something missing that we need to

526
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,908
uh, cook.

527
00:32:54,933 --> 00:32:56,744
Because a customer
was looking for it.

528
00:33:57,004 --> 00:33:58,171
Where did you pass by?

529
00:33:58,245 --> 00:33:59,919
I was going to ask
you out on a date.

530
00:34:01,368 --> 00:34:02,911
Since when did you
start going on dates, huh?

531
00:34:02,935 --> 00:34:05,694
- You don’t want to?
- Quiet, Mom’s there.

532
00:34:07,982 --> 00:34:08,982
Let’s just stay here.

533
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:10,418
We’re already here anyway.

534
00:34:11,285 --> 00:34:13,161
Wait. Your aunt might see us.

535
00:34:13,186 --> 00:34:14,906
- She’ll tell your mom.
- She’s on our side.

536
00:34:15,032 --> 00:34:16,408
Don’t mind her,
she’s on our side.

537
00:36:06,017 --> 00:36:07,017
Oh, god!

538
00:38:40,755 --> 00:38:41,797
So, is it okay?

539
00:38:42,329 --> 00:38:43,705
It’s nice, Daddy.

540
00:38:44,154 --> 00:38:48,450
You seem to be trying
too hard to impress Sarah.

541
00:38:48,763 --> 00:38:50,604
Of course, so they’ll like us.

542
00:38:50,629 --> 00:38:51,843
So they’ll think well of us.

543
00:38:53,048 --> 00:38:54,048
Hey!

544
00:38:54,393 --> 00:38:55,519
Hi, Nick!

545
00:38:57,396 --> 00:38:59,403
- Boss, they said you were calling me.
- Hi, Nick!

546
00:38:59,541 --> 00:39:00,583
Wow, ignoring me.

547
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,650
Hi!

548
00:39:01,675 --> 00:39:02,675
Hi, Becky.

549
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:06,094
Nick, Mr. Bernardo...

550
00:39:07,031 --> 00:39:09,271
His motorcycle, is it ready?
He's picking it up tomorrow.

551
00:39:09,656 --> 00:39:11,976
I’ll just take some overtime
so I can finish it right away.

552
00:39:12,512 --> 00:39:15,306
Daddy, can’t you have
someone else work on it?

553
00:39:15,331 --> 00:39:17,917
Because Nick and
I are going out later.

554
00:39:18,691 --> 00:39:20,318
Then who’s supposed to do it?

555
00:39:21,879 --> 00:39:23,129
Horace.

556
00:39:23,154 --> 00:39:25,448
He can handle it, right Nick?

557
00:39:26,968 --> 00:39:28,886
Nick, start working
on the bikes.

558
00:39:29,146 --> 00:39:31,690
Then let Horace finish them.

559
00:39:31,866 --> 00:39:33,117
If you can’t finish on time.

560
00:39:33,364 --> 00:39:34,611
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

561
00:39:36,216 --> 00:39:37,259
Is it nice?

562
00:39:37,582 --> 00:39:38,582
Does it look good?

563
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:41,348
It suits you.
Did you just buy it?

564
00:39:42,435 --> 00:39:45,778
It's not mine. It's for Dad's
girlfriend's daughter.

565
00:39:47,655 --> 00:39:49,323
Alright sir, I’ll
finish this up.

566
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,951
See you!

567
00:39:58,374 --> 00:40:00,042
Sarah, let’s go!

568
00:40:00,351 --> 00:40:01,631
Your mom asked
me to pick you up.

569
00:40:06,257 --> 00:40:07,257
Come on!

570
00:40:07,425 --> 00:40:08,425
Get in.

571
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:18,582
Huh?

572
00:40:19,562 --> 00:40:20,980
What do you need, a plate?

573
00:40:21,727 --> 00:40:23,399
- Hello?
- Mom!

574
00:40:23,424 --> 00:40:25,134
Did you ask Michael
to pick me up?

575
00:40:25,443 --> 00:40:28,320
Yes. Why, dear?

576
00:40:28,738 --> 00:40:30,197
It’s embarrassing.

577
00:40:30,582 --> 00:40:32,042
Why would it be embarrassing?

578
00:40:32,408 --> 00:40:34,888
There’s nothing wrong with that,
he’s already heading that way.

579
00:40:34,913 --> 00:40:37,415
Or is someone else
picking you up, huh?

580
00:40:37,747 --> 00:40:39,498
Oh Mom, what's up with you?

581
00:40:40,155 --> 00:40:41,267
Alright, alright.

582
00:40:41,292 --> 00:40:44,086
Just ride with him so you
can get home early, okay?

583
00:41:01,062 --> 00:41:03,314
Wait, why did we stop?

584
00:41:04,167 --> 00:41:05,558
I have something to give you.

585
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:18,204
Thank you.

586
00:41:20,414 --> 00:41:22,249
Why? What’s the occasion?

587
00:41:22,833 --> 00:41:25,753
There doesn’t have to be an
occasion for someone to give a gift.

588
00:41:26,003 --> 00:41:27,004
Here, try it on.

589
00:41:27,922 --> 00:41:29,002
Let me put it on you, okay?

590
00:41:47,817 --> 00:41:49,217
You’re becoming
even more beautiful.

591
00:41:50,027 --> 00:41:51,070
Thank you.

592
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,320
Shall we go?

593
00:41:52,363 --> 00:41:53,363
Can we go home now?

594
00:41:53,823 --> 00:41:56,117
Mom might already be worried.

595
00:41:56,408 --> 00:41:58,077
Wait, I still have
something else for you.

596
00:42:04,542 --> 00:42:05,668
Why do you have a gun?

597
00:42:06,361 --> 00:42:08,237
Oh, that…
It’s just a fake gun.

598
00:42:09,649 --> 00:42:10,756
Have you used it?

599
00:42:11,423 --> 00:42:13,300
No, it’s just for good luck.

600
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:18,581
Here, just don’t tell
your mom, okay?

601
00:42:20,933 --> 00:42:22,550
Mister... Michael?

602
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:25,104
Don’t call me
Mr. Michael anymore.

603
00:42:25,383 --> 00:42:26,438
That makes me sound old.

604
00:42:28,399 --> 00:42:29,816
It just feels awkward.

605
00:42:29,817 --> 00:42:30,817
The gifts you give…

606
00:42:31,777 --> 00:42:33,654
They’re really expensive.

607
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:36,030
It’s nothing.

608
00:42:36,323 --> 00:42:37,575
I just want us to

609
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:39,117
get closer,

610
00:42:39,118 --> 00:42:40,118
to be friends.

611
00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:42,454
Especially now that we
live in the same house.

612
00:42:43,831 --> 00:42:44,831
Is that okay?

613
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Okay.

614
00:43:17,117 --> 00:43:19,617
- Hey, Nick. Come on.
- Uhh...

615
00:43:19,618 --> 00:43:21,535
- No, I’m fine.
- Come on, let’s drink already, come on!

616
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:23,124
- No. I’m fine here.
- Come on, let's dance!

617
00:43:23,148 --> 00:43:24,163
Don’t be shy.

618
00:43:24,188 --> 00:43:25,708
- No, really, it’s fine.
- Come on now.

619
00:43:25,733 --> 00:43:26,796
Come on.

620
00:43:27,708 --> 00:43:30,002
Come on, don’t
be such a killjoy.

621
00:43:30,252 --> 00:43:32,296
- Right?
- Yeah, let’s go!

622
00:43:32,546 --> 00:43:33,756
Let's go.

623
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,928
There you go!

624
00:44:33,023 --> 00:44:34,650
[Should I come see you?]

625
00:44:37,903 --> 00:44:41,782
- [Should I come see you?]
- [Don’t, I’m going to sleep now.]

626
00:44:53,794 --> 00:44:54,794
Shit.

627
00:44:55,272 --> 00:44:58,734
It's not mine. It's for Dad's
girlfriend's daughter.

628
00:45:01,802 --> 00:45:06,306
[Where did you get
that necklace?]

629
00:45:06,331 --> 00:45:14,130
- [Where did you get that necklace?]
- [Bribe from Mom’s boyfriend.]

630
00:46:55,165 --> 00:46:56,792
Beb, I’m not in the mood.

631
00:46:58,794 --> 00:47:00,087
Stop it!

632
00:47:06,385 --> 00:47:07,427
It hurts.

633
00:47:07,428 --> 00:47:08,428
Stop!

634
00:47:09,138 --> 00:47:10,138
Almost there.

635
00:47:11,223 --> 00:47:12,516
Stop it, Beb!

636
00:47:34,538 --> 00:47:35,538
Wow!

637
00:47:35,998 --> 00:47:38,125
So pretty!

638
00:47:38,876 --> 00:47:41,336
- It suits you! You look great.
- Yeah.

639
00:47:42,045 --> 00:47:43,881
There, thanks!

640
00:47:44,965 --> 00:47:46,007
Oh, it looks
really nice after all.

641
00:47:46,008 --> 00:47:47,652
Then why were you
trying to bargain with me?

642
00:47:47,676 --> 00:47:50,094
Just come to my wedding and eat a lot

643
00:47:50,095 --> 00:47:52,055
so I can make it up to you.

644
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,170
Oh, no need.

645
00:47:53,224 --> 00:47:55,016
Just make me one of
the godmothers, okay?

646
00:47:55,017 --> 00:47:56,142
For your child.

647
00:47:56,143 --> 00:47:57,727
That’s still far off, Choleng.

648
00:47:57,728 --> 00:47:59,104
You might be dead by then.

649
00:47:59,229 --> 00:48:01,230
Oh no, why did
you even try it on?

650
00:48:01,231 --> 00:48:03,233
What if your wedding
doesn’t push through?

651
00:48:03,317 --> 00:48:04,860
That’s not a thing anymore.

652
00:48:04,985 --> 00:48:06,779
- Yeah!
- Are you sure?

653
00:48:07,154 --> 00:48:08,488
Oh, damn it.

654
00:48:08,489 --> 00:48:10,114
See, that’s what I was saying.

655
00:48:10,115 --> 00:48:11,575
Now it won’t close.

656
00:48:12,179 --> 00:48:13,243
Oh no.

657
00:48:13,268 --> 00:48:15,561
Vivian, wait a minute.
Let’s change the topic.

658
00:48:15,787 --> 00:48:18,080
Didn’t your daughter’s
boyfriend get mad

659
00:48:18,105 --> 00:48:20,233
that your fiancé
sleeps over there?

660
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:21,420
Boyfriend?

661
00:48:21,517 --> 00:48:23,101
My daughter doesn’t
have a boyfriend.

662
00:48:23,136 --> 00:48:26,097
And even if she did, so what?

663
00:48:26,673 --> 00:48:28,342
You already know that.

664
00:48:28,592 --> 00:48:31,219
Come on! Your daughter’s
pretty and sexy.

665
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:33,055
Right? Men will want her.
It’s up to you.

666
00:48:33,194 --> 00:48:35,014
- Hey! Just fix this already!
- Whatever!

667
00:48:35,015 --> 00:48:36,391
- Just fix this.
- Fine, really!

668
00:51:43,912 --> 00:51:44,912
Oh?

669
00:51:44,996 --> 00:51:46,038
Come on, just one kiss.

670
00:51:46,063 --> 00:51:47,440
You’re so persistent. Next time.

671
00:51:47,582 --> 00:51:48,583
Come on, just one.

672
00:51:49,376 --> 00:51:51,460
Keep quiet.
mom might hear us.

673
00:51:51,485 --> 00:51:52,528
What’s that? Just one!

674
00:51:58,510 --> 00:52:00,470
Not here, someone
might see us. Wait.

675
00:52:00,929 --> 00:52:01,930
What’s wrong?

676
00:57:19,247 --> 00:57:20,457
Here, have some more.

677
00:57:20,665 --> 00:57:22,834
- Keep eating, okay?
- Thank you.

678
00:57:22,835 --> 00:57:24,543
- You, have you eaten?
- Oh, later.

679
00:57:24,544 --> 00:57:25,878
Oh my, don’t worry about me.

680
00:57:25,879 --> 00:57:27,171
Here, luncheon meat.

681
00:57:27,172 --> 00:57:29,716
Aning, have you
counted our utensils yet?

682
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:32,302
Oh, not yet.
Okay, I’ll count them later.

683
00:57:32,552 --> 00:57:36,007
And count the glasses too,
so we can buy some more.

684
00:57:36,032 --> 00:57:37,057
Alright then.

685
00:57:37,058 --> 00:57:39,030
So how many guests do
you have at the wedding?

686
00:57:39,559 --> 00:57:42,311
Hey Beb, how many
guests do we have again?

687
00:57:42,312 --> 00:57:45,397
Bring your workers too, include
them in our wedding, okay?

688
00:57:45,398 --> 00:57:46,858
Bring them all.

689
00:57:47,358 --> 00:57:48,984
Alright.
However many, it’s fine.

690
00:57:49,363 --> 00:57:50,363
I’ll take care of it?

691
00:57:50,737 --> 00:57:51,863
Okay, sure.

692
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:03,040
You’re early.

693
00:58:03,124 --> 00:58:04,124
Didn't you go to school?

694
00:58:05,752 --> 00:58:06,795
I'm not in the mood.

695
00:58:07,128 --> 00:58:09,005
Why? Are you feeling sick?

696
00:58:10,507 --> 00:58:12,175
Why didn’t you just stay home?

697
00:58:12,717 --> 00:58:13,717
Bad vibes.

698
00:58:14,177 --> 00:58:15,804
It’s my mom’s boyfriend.

699
00:58:16,888 --> 00:58:17,888
What did he do to you?

700
00:58:18,537 --> 00:58:19,538
Feels like a creep.

701
00:58:19,974 --> 00:58:21,768
And the way he looks
at me is disgusting.

702
00:58:22,393 --> 00:58:23,436
That bastard.

703
00:58:23,990 --> 00:58:25,198
You want me to beat him up?

704
00:58:25,292 --> 00:58:26,585
I’ll call my buddies right now.

705
00:58:27,192 --> 00:58:28,192
- Don’t.
- What?

706
00:58:28,556 --> 00:58:30,016
Mom’s happy with him.

707
00:58:32,445 --> 00:58:33,530
You sure about that?

708
00:58:35,073 --> 00:58:36,282
Just say the word.

709
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:38,051
We’ll wait for him.

710
00:58:39,845 --> 00:58:40,845
Really?

711
00:58:41,344 --> 00:58:43,555
Or are you just all talk?

712
00:58:44,874 --> 00:58:46,334
Try me then.

713
00:58:47,669 --> 00:58:48,669
No need.

714
00:58:49,921 --> 00:58:50,921
Anyway,

715
00:58:51,422 --> 00:58:53,133
Be careful, okay.

716
00:58:53,675 --> 00:58:57,136
Vivian, here are the
invitations from the supplier.

717
00:58:57,137 --> 00:58:58,178
Oh, wow!

718
00:58:58,179 --> 00:58:59,973
Beb, what do you think?

719
00:58:59,998 --> 00:59:01,933
Beb, uhh, let me see.

720
00:59:02,767 --> 00:59:04,227
It’s beautiful, right?

721
00:59:04,978 --> 00:59:06,812
The paper looks kind of old.

722
00:59:06,813 --> 00:59:07,813
And it’s wrinkled.

723
00:59:08,197 --> 00:59:09,782
Huh? Old?

724
00:59:10,024 --> 00:59:13,444
Can’t we get something
newer and finer?

725
00:59:13,635 --> 00:59:15,128
There are some, Sir.

726
00:59:15,381 --> 00:59:18,007
Ah, if you want,
I’ll call the supplier

727
00:59:18,032 --> 00:59:20,009
to send other samples.

728
00:59:20,034 --> 00:59:21,536
- Alright.
- Okay.

729
00:59:21,786 --> 00:59:23,304
- That one’s ugly.
- Okay.

730
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:25,080
I’ll be right back,
just a moment.

731
00:59:25,105 --> 00:59:26,105
Thank you.

732
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:27,855
Beb, are you okay?

733
00:59:27,917 --> 00:59:29,376
Are you feeling unwell?

734
00:59:29,377 --> 00:59:31,171
What? No. Uh...

735
00:59:32,547 --> 00:59:34,673
I don’t want you to think
I’m butting into your life

736
00:59:34,674 --> 00:59:35,716
with you and Sarah.

737
00:59:35,717 --> 00:59:36,717
Your life together.

738
00:59:36,759 --> 00:59:38,969
Why? What did Sarah do to you?

739
00:59:38,970 --> 00:59:41,014
- Did she pick a fight with you?
- No.

740
00:59:41,039 --> 00:59:42,456
What’s been messing
with my head is,

741
00:59:43,266 --> 00:59:45,226
I saw her in
the basement with Nick.

742
00:59:45,935 --> 00:59:47,604
What do you mean?

743
00:59:47,979 --> 00:59:48,979
All I mean is,

744
00:59:49,105 --> 00:59:52,567
Beb, I don’t want Sarah
to become a single mom.

745
01:00:01,517 --> 01:00:04,061
Auntie, what’s this?
Why are you closing so early...

746
01:00:08,666 --> 01:00:10,084
What happened?

747
01:00:10,418 --> 01:00:11,586
Your mom.

748
01:00:22,138 --> 01:00:23,138
Mom,

749
01:00:25,350 --> 01:00:26,351
what…

750
01:00:27,018 --> 01:00:28,394
What happened?

751
01:00:30,104 --> 01:00:32,190
You got the nerve
to ask me why?

752
01:00:32,982 --> 01:00:35,818
I should be the one asking you that.
Why did you do that?

753
01:00:36,527 --> 01:00:38,279
And in our basement?

754
01:00:44,285 --> 01:00:46,204
You turned this house
into an apartelle!

755
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:47,860
Shame on you!

756
01:00:49,099 --> 01:00:50,643
You’ve only been at your
grandma’s for a few months.

757
01:00:50,667 --> 01:00:52,919
And you’re already like that.
You’ve lost your shame!

758
01:00:53,646 --> 01:00:55,980
I’m really not doing
anything wrong!

759
01:00:56,005 --> 01:00:57,548
You liar!

760
01:00:57,674 --> 01:00:59,133
You liar!

761
01:00:59,467 --> 01:01:01,134
Why are you lying?

762
01:01:01,159 --> 01:01:03,736
Michael clearly saw
you with that man!

763
01:01:03,930 --> 01:01:06,015
What will he feed you?

764
01:01:06,391 --> 01:01:07,391
Dick?

765
01:01:07,850 --> 01:01:09,643
How is he going to support you?

766
01:01:09,668 --> 01:01:10,961
Look at me!

767
01:01:12,522 --> 01:01:13,523
Where’s your phone?

768
01:01:14,148 --> 01:01:15,441
That phone’s mine now!

769
01:01:16,359 --> 01:01:17,443
It’s mine!

770
01:01:17,526 --> 01:01:19,170
- Where is it!
- Mom!

771
01:01:19,195 --> 01:01:20,195
Sarah!

772
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:21,781
That phone’s mine now!

773
01:01:26,536 --> 01:01:27,662
Get out!

774
01:01:28,013 --> 01:01:29,806
Get out of the house now.

775
01:01:29,831 --> 01:01:31,207
Don’t ever come out
of the house, okay!

776
01:01:31,231 --> 01:01:32,899
Stay in your room!

777
01:01:33,519 --> 01:01:35,099
- I can't believe you!
- Mom!

778
01:01:35,628 --> 01:01:36,838
You slut!

779
01:01:36,884 --> 01:01:37,981
You slut!

780
01:01:38,006 --> 01:01:40,007
I didn’t raise you like that!

781
01:01:40,032 --> 01:01:41,533
You slut! Get out!

782
01:01:47,890 --> 01:01:48,890
Sarah.

783
01:01:59,527 --> 01:02:00,527
Sign.

784
01:02:01,237 --> 01:02:03,114
Okay. This is your...

785
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:06,700
Thank you, Boss!

786
01:02:08,453 --> 01:02:09,453
And...

787
01:02:09,638 --> 01:02:10,638
Thank you.

788
01:02:14,635 --> 01:02:16,679
Boss, you called me.

789
01:02:19,672 --> 01:02:21,392
Please step outside,
I need to talk to Nick.

790
01:02:22,633 --> 01:02:23,633
Nick.

791
01:02:23,965 --> 01:02:25,450
I like your work.

792
01:02:25,636 --> 01:02:26,763
But I don’t like being...

793
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:29,196
screwed over above everything.

794
01:02:30,157 --> 01:02:31,704
I don’t like being
taken advantage of.

795
01:02:32,018 --> 01:02:33,478
Boss, what are you saying?

796
01:02:34,029 --> 01:02:35,337
Someone told me.

797
01:02:36,030 --> 01:02:37,831
That you suddenly
disappear at work.

798
01:02:38,623 --> 01:02:40,651
Then go to the
warehouse and sleep.

799
01:02:41,486 --> 01:02:43,196
That doesn’t happen, Boss.

800
01:02:43,613 --> 01:02:45,448
I don’t want to
fire you, Nick, but…

801
01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:47,367
We’ll give you a break for now.

802
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:50,536
What the hell is your problem?

803
01:02:50,802 --> 01:02:51,802
What?

804
01:02:54,973 --> 01:02:55,973
Relax.

805
01:02:56,642 --> 01:02:57,919
You're something else, huh?

806
01:02:59,592 --> 01:03:00,871
You think I don’t know?

807
01:03:00,896 --> 01:03:03,437
- That you’re doing this for Sarah.
- Calm down.

808
01:03:03,493 --> 01:03:04,984
- What’s wrong with Sarah?
- See?

809
01:03:05,009 --> 01:03:06,677
What an asshole.

810
01:03:07,637 --> 01:03:09,222
Here’s your paycheck.
Take it.

811
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:10,848
Don’t come back here.

812
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:14,140
- I might not be able to control myself.
- You’ll pick a fight with me, huh?

813
01:03:14,185 --> 01:03:15,561
Remember this.

814
01:03:16,121 --> 01:03:19,624
If anything bad happens
to Sarah, I won’t forgive you.

815
01:03:19,649 --> 01:03:20,955
You son of a bitch!

816
01:03:22,318 --> 01:03:24,057
- Get out.
- Let go of me.

817
01:03:25,321 --> 01:03:27,072
Screw you, bastard.

818
01:03:31,143 --> 01:03:32,853
What happened, Daddy?

819
01:04:09,991 --> 01:04:10,991
Hello?

820
01:04:44,942 --> 01:04:45,942
Hello, Beb?

821
01:04:46,194 --> 01:04:48,488
Beb, I need a favor.

822
01:04:48,613 --> 01:04:51,157
Can you pick up Sarah?

823
01:04:51,182 --> 01:04:53,517
Looks like her boyfriend
is hovering around again.

824
01:04:53,743 --> 01:04:54,743
Alright, Beb.

825
01:04:54,949 --> 01:04:56,189
I’ll take care of it right now.

826
01:04:56,470 --> 01:04:57,642
Okay, Beb.

827
01:04:57,903 --> 01:04:58,903
Take care.

828
01:04:59,397 --> 01:05:00,625
Love you.

829
01:05:15,195 --> 01:05:16,475
I’ll send them home first, okay.

830
01:05:17,483 --> 01:05:18,483
Ed.

831
01:05:18,734 --> 01:05:19,827
Hey.

832
01:05:19,852 --> 01:05:20,932
- Wait, hold on.
- Oh, boss?

833
01:05:21,107 --> 01:05:22,146
Boss.

834
01:05:22,217 --> 01:05:23,977
Go home for now, the
rain’s getting stronger.

835
01:05:24,315 --> 01:05:25,441
You sure, boss?

836
01:05:26,226 --> 01:05:27,735
We still have a lot pending.

837
01:05:28,043 --> 01:05:29,795
But you might get
flooded at home.

838
01:05:29,820 --> 01:05:30,821
So...

839
01:05:30,822 --> 01:05:32,781
- Alright, we’ll finish it tomorrow. Yeah.
- So, we’re heading out, boss?

840
01:05:32,805 --> 01:05:33,841
Just get it from, uh…

841
01:05:33,866 --> 01:05:34,889
- From the accountant.
- Got it, sir.

842
01:05:34,913 --> 01:05:36,999
- Thank you, boss. Take care.
- Yeah.

843
01:05:50,774 --> 01:05:53,657
Oh, classes are suspended.
You might not get a ride later.

844
01:05:54,192 --> 01:05:56,901
Oh, it’s fine. I’m just
waiting for my ride.

845
01:06:04,579 --> 01:06:06,059
Sarah. Let’s go.

846
01:06:13,125 --> 01:06:14,125
Get in.

847
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:31,715
Boss. Is Sarah still here?

848
01:06:32,133 --> 01:06:33,133
She just left.

849
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:57,342
Come on. Let’s go upstairs.

850
01:06:57,367 --> 01:06:58,826
We’ll wait for the
rain to stop here.

851
01:06:59,243 --> 01:07:01,537
Huh? Why don’t we just go home?

852
01:07:01,871 --> 01:07:02,872
Because maybe...

853
01:07:03,623 --> 01:07:05,374
the car might get
stuck in the flood.

854
01:07:05,583 --> 01:07:08,169
Oh, it’s okay. I'll just hail
a motorcycle instead.

855
01:07:09,146 --> 01:07:10,146
I’ll call your mom.

856
01:07:10,171 --> 01:07:12,089
- I’ll just message her.
- No, my mom’s already worried.

857
01:07:12,113 --> 01:07:13,113
Come on.

858
01:07:13,299 --> 01:07:15,133
It’s getting late.

859
01:07:15,158 --> 01:07:17,198
We’ll leave soon. Just
waiting for the rain to stop.

860
01:07:17,845 --> 01:07:18,845
Here.

861
01:07:21,474 --> 01:07:22,474
Oh.

862
01:07:26,657 --> 01:07:27,657
Hi.

863
01:07:28,341 --> 01:07:29,600
Um...

864
01:07:30,191 --> 01:07:31,858
Is Nick here?

865
01:07:31,883 --> 01:07:33,468
My god, so gorgeous.

866
01:07:33,514 --> 01:07:35,725
Well, he lives over there.

867
01:07:36,614 --> 01:07:38,407
Inside that alley, babe.

868
01:07:38,824 --> 01:07:40,242
She’s so pretty. Nick!

869
01:07:40,534 --> 01:07:42,370
You’ve got a visitor!
She’s gorgeous!

870
01:07:42,620 --> 01:07:44,038
So sexy!

871
01:07:44,246 --> 01:07:45,748
Just like me!

872
01:07:47,208 --> 01:07:48,626
Nick.

873
01:07:50,169 --> 01:07:51,796
Nick.

874
01:07:52,630 --> 01:07:55,091
Nick.

875
01:07:57,385 --> 01:07:59,595
Nick.

876
01:08:01,597 --> 01:08:04,642
Aw, Nick.

877
01:08:06,977 --> 01:08:09,480
Hi, Nick.

878
01:08:10,398 --> 01:08:12,358
Hello.

879
01:08:12,983 --> 01:08:14,860
Becky, what are you doing here?

880
01:08:15,611 --> 01:08:17,697
You—

881
01:08:22,236 --> 01:08:23,738
What are you doing here?

882
01:08:30,543 --> 01:08:32,878
You look so handsome.

883
01:08:34,547 --> 01:08:37,675
You left your salary.

884
01:08:38,384 --> 01:08:40,594
But you can get it here.

885
01:08:41,387 --> 01:08:42,513
Here.

886
01:08:45,099 --> 01:08:46,642
Go on, take it.

887
01:08:47,017 --> 01:08:48,436
Go ahead.

888
01:08:49,103 --> 01:08:51,355
Come on, take it.

889
01:08:51,897 --> 01:08:53,816
Look at me.

890
01:08:54,358 --> 01:08:55,358
What’s that?

891
01:08:55,651 --> 01:08:57,528
Is that how you’re taking it?

892
01:09:00,030 --> 01:09:02,616
Can I sleep here?

893
01:09:04,452 --> 01:09:05,536
Why here?

894
01:09:06,912 --> 01:09:08,956
Why do you even
want to sleep here?

895
01:09:09,373 --> 01:09:10,708
I missed you.

896
01:09:11,417 --> 01:09:14,127
Isn’t it obvious? I missed you.

897
01:09:14,152 --> 01:09:16,154
Becky, you can’t sleep here.

898
01:09:17,506 --> 01:09:18,591
Just go home.

899
01:09:19,258 --> 01:09:20,676
I want ramen.

900
01:09:22,052 --> 01:09:25,388
- What?
- I want ramen.

901
01:09:25,389 --> 01:09:28,100
Steaming, hot ramen.

902
01:09:29,643 --> 01:09:31,936
- I said I want ramen!
- Becky!

903
01:09:31,937 --> 01:09:34,064
Ramen!

904
01:09:34,089 --> 01:09:36,049
- Becky, quiet!
- Ramen, ramen, ramen!

905
01:09:43,657 --> 01:09:46,076
I forgot my charger.
My phone's already dead.

906
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:49,764
Ah okay, okay I’ll just go home,

907
01:09:49,789 --> 01:09:51,915
Mom’s already
looking for me too.

908
01:09:51,940 --> 01:09:52,940
Sarah.

909
01:09:53,626 --> 01:09:55,336
Sit down first. We’re
not in your campus.

910
01:09:56,337 --> 01:09:57,337
I’ll show you something.

911
01:09:59,201 --> 01:10:01,369
We won’t catch anything outside.

912
01:10:01,675 --> 01:10:02,843
The storm’s really strong.

913
01:10:07,139 --> 01:10:10,559
Michael, mom's probably
looking for me already.

914
01:10:11,769 --> 01:10:13,561
Sarah, give me your phone.

915
01:10:13,586 --> 01:10:14,712
Michael!

916
01:10:16,148 --> 01:10:17,691
Stop resisting.

917
01:10:18,651 --> 01:10:21,153
You’re hurting me, Michael!

918
01:10:27,076 --> 01:10:28,869
I know you’ve wanted
this for a long time.

919
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:32,414
Michael!

920
01:10:43,592 --> 01:10:45,928
Michael!

921
01:10:48,347 --> 01:10:50,683
Mom!

922
01:11:14,957 --> 01:11:16,750
Michael!

923
01:11:31,849 --> 01:11:34,894
Mom!

924
01:11:51,702 --> 01:11:53,704
Stop!

925
01:12:10,179 --> 01:12:11,722
Stop!

926
01:12:26,403 --> 01:12:27,780
I’m coming in, okay?

927
01:12:32,910 --> 01:12:34,203
Sarah, it’s time to eat.

928
01:12:42,670 --> 01:12:45,047
Are you sick?

929
01:12:51,136 --> 01:12:52,805
Sarah said she’ll follow soon.

930
01:12:53,472 --> 01:12:54,807
Oh, why?

931
01:12:55,232 --> 01:12:56,942
What’s wrong with
Sarah this time?

932
01:12:57,233 --> 01:12:58,609
The kid’s not feeling well.

933
01:12:58,644 --> 01:13:00,604
Maybe she’s just
acting up again.

934
01:13:00,896 --> 01:13:03,148
Please wash the
mangoes in the kitchen.

935
01:13:03,649 --> 01:13:04,649
Huh?

936
01:13:15,661 --> 01:13:17,913
Oh. What’s going on with you?

937
01:13:18,486 --> 01:13:19,486
Sit down.

938
01:13:20,082 --> 01:13:21,082
Sit!

939
01:13:24,206 --> 01:13:25,289
What is it now?

940
01:13:25,337 --> 01:13:27,256
You’re frowning
in front of the food again.

941
01:13:27,715 --> 01:13:29,924
Mom, I have
something to tell you.

942
01:13:29,925 --> 01:13:31,009
Later.

943
01:13:31,034 --> 01:13:32,493
Oh, there’s Michael.

944
01:13:33,387 --> 01:13:34,387
Beb.

945
01:13:34,847 --> 01:13:36,265
- Come here.
- Beb.

946
01:13:36,432 --> 01:13:38,726
- Let’s all eat together.
- Okay, thank you.

947
01:13:39,018 --> 01:13:40,143
Ah, Aning?

948
01:13:40,168 --> 01:13:41,335
The mangoes?

949
01:13:43,164 --> 01:13:44,665
How was your day, Beb?

950
01:13:44,690 --> 01:13:45,983
It was fine, Beb.

951
01:13:47,443 --> 01:13:49,361
Go on, eat. This is really good.

952
01:13:51,447 --> 01:13:52,865
Okay, let’s say grace.

953
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:57,286
In the name of the Father, and
of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit...

954
01:14:03,333 --> 01:14:04,835
What is it, Sarah?

955
01:14:05,419 --> 01:14:07,713
What’s with the attitude again?

956
01:14:09,923 --> 01:14:11,759
- Mom.
- What?

957
01:14:12,051 --> 01:14:14,928
- Michael…
- Michael again.

958
01:14:15,095 --> 01:14:17,639
We’ve talked about
this so many times.

959
01:14:17,931 --> 01:14:20,631
What is your problem
with Michael, huh?

960
01:14:20,656 --> 01:14:21,810
Vivian, that’s enough.

961
01:14:22,153 --> 01:14:24,363
- Don’t be so harsh.
- Enough?

962
01:14:24,388 --> 01:14:25,414
Listen here.

963
01:14:25,439 --> 01:14:28,082
If you didn’t want Michael,
you should’ve said so before.

964
01:14:28,108 --> 01:14:30,027
You’re getting on my nerves.

965
01:14:30,442 --> 01:14:31,906
Do you understand me?

966
01:14:32,172 --> 01:14:33,339
- Mom…
- If you’re upset

967
01:14:33,364 --> 01:14:35,031
seeing me and Michael together,

968
01:14:35,056 --> 01:14:36,687
then go back to your
grandma’s house.

969
01:14:36,950 --> 01:14:39,303
Mom, please listen to me.

970
01:14:39,328 --> 01:14:41,663
I don’t care what
you have to say.

971
01:14:41,830 --> 01:14:43,499
Mom!

972
01:14:43,808 --> 01:14:46,435
You’re not the one
Michael’s marrying!

973
01:14:46,460 --> 01:14:47,460
I am.

974
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:50,505
I’m so tired from working, huh?

975
01:14:50,530 --> 01:14:53,199
And this is what I come home to!

976
01:14:53,790 --> 01:14:57,074
You're really testing my patience,
you’re such a headache!

977
01:14:57,387 --> 01:14:59,932
Mom! I need you.

978
01:15:04,937 --> 01:15:06,939
This kid is so annoying.

979
01:15:08,148 --> 01:15:09,483
Unbelievable.

980
01:15:17,658 --> 01:15:19,785
Oh, Beb. I’m really sorry.

981
01:15:20,494 --> 01:15:21,494
Let’s just eat.

982
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:22,620
Alright.

983
01:15:59,908 --> 01:16:01,701
Hello? Sarah?

984
01:16:02,661 --> 01:16:04,357
Why’d you ditch me?

985
01:16:05,956 --> 01:16:10,122
Nick, the ramen’s here.

986
01:16:10,961 --> 01:16:12,421
Who are you with?

987
01:16:14,047 --> 01:16:16,216
Ah, just a coworker.

988
01:16:17,193 --> 01:16:18,277
Are you okay?

989
01:16:18,302 --> 01:16:19,303
Are you crying?

990
01:16:19,928 --> 01:16:20,929
No.

991
01:16:24,725 --> 01:16:26,059
Let’s just meet up.

992
01:16:26,310 --> 01:16:27,936
I don’t know what to do anymore.

993
01:16:28,353 --> 01:16:29,646
Oh, okay, okay.

994
01:16:29,897 --> 01:16:30,981
What’s happening?

995
01:16:32,983 --> 01:16:34,443
Nick, the—

996
01:16:55,505 --> 01:16:56,505
Hello?

997
01:16:57,049 --> 01:16:58,049
Beb.

998
01:16:58,383 --> 01:16:59,551
Beb, what are you doing?

999
01:17:00,636 --> 01:17:02,429
- Getting my nails done.
- Okay, Beb.

1000
01:17:02,679 --> 01:17:04,115
Let me see later
when I get home, okay?

1001
01:17:04,139 --> 01:17:05,265
I’ll eat there too.

1002
01:17:05,390 --> 01:17:06,391
Ah, okay, Beb.

1003
01:17:06,725 --> 01:17:09,853
I’ll have something
delicious cooked.

1004
01:17:10,229 --> 01:17:11,313
Can I please talk to Sarah?

1005
01:17:11,730 --> 01:17:13,523
Ah, okay. Just a second.

1006
01:17:15,651 --> 01:17:16,735
Sarah?

1007
01:17:18,695 --> 01:17:20,322
Sarah?

1008
01:17:20,822 --> 01:17:22,990
Oh, ma’am, are you calling

1009
01:17:23,015 --> 01:17:24,976
the pretty petite morena?

1010
01:17:25,327 --> 01:17:27,245
- Oh, why?
- She went out.

1011
01:17:27,871 --> 01:17:29,456
Huh? Oh, Beb.

1012
01:17:29,766 --> 01:17:31,350
That damn kid.

1013
01:17:31,375 --> 01:17:33,585
She’s so stubborn.
She went out again!

1014
01:17:33,710 --> 01:17:35,390
I thought you weren’t
going to let her out?

1015
01:17:35,462 --> 01:17:36,837
Oh no, I’m really sorry, Beb.

1016
01:17:36,862 --> 01:17:39,699
I was sleepy. I didn’t notice.

1017
01:17:55,524 --> 01:17:56,764
Excuse me, can I ask something?

1018
01:17:57,818 --> 01:17:58,818
Yes.

1019
01:17:59,361 --> 01:18:00,904
Is Nick here?

1020
01:18:02,489 --> 01:18:03,781
He’s not here.

1021
01:18:03,782 --> 01:18:04,949
He left.

1022
01:18:04,974 --> 01:18:06,600
Maybe he went to work.

1023
01:18:06,994 --> 01:18:08,161
Work? What work does he do?

1024
01:18:08,620 --> 01:18:09,746
At the shop.

1025
01:18:14,376 --> 01:18:16,128
If only Dad were still alive.

1026
01:18:19,464 --> 01:18:22,050
That man, Michael,
won't get near me.

1027
01:18:23,385 --> 01:18:24,665
That Michael is an asshole.

1028
01:18:25,178 --> 01:18:26,221
Such an animal.

1029
01:18:27,639 --> 01:18:29,182
I want to leave.

1030
01:18:32,644 --> 01:18:35,314
I want to go back
to my grandma's.

1031
01:18:36,398 --> 01:18:37,816
Sarah, that’s your home.

1032
01:18:38,025 --> 01:18:40,902
If anyone should leave,
it should be Michael.

1033
01:18:41,361 --> 01:18:42,361
No.

1034
01:18:42,487 --> 01:18:44,823
Mom’s not listening
to me anymore.

1035
01:18:47,951 --> 01:18:50,203
I’m getting crazy
over that Michael.

1036
01:18:50,871 --> 01:18:51,871
I’ll take care of it.

1037
01:18:52,789 --> 01:18:55,417
We’ll report him to the
police, to the barangay,

1038
01:18:55,709 --> 01:18:57,336
or I’ll do it myself.

1039
01:18:57,919 --> 01:19:00,547
I’ll be the one to
kill that bastard.

1040
01:19:22,819 --> 01:19:23,819
Sit down first.

1041
01:19:26,490 --> 01:19:28,617
I’ll just talk to Mom upstairs.

1042
01:19:28,825 --> 01:19:29,868
Calm down, okay?

1043
01:19:30,577 --> 01:19:31,577
Just calm down, okay?

1044
01:19:49,596 --> 01:19:50,596
Wow!

1045
01:19:50,931 --> 01:19:52,015
Good afternoon.

1046
01:19:53,058 --> 01:19:54,058
Just relax.

1047
01:19:54,309 --> 01:19:55,309
Please take a seat.

1048
01:19:55,936 --> 01:19:56,936
We're about to leave.

1049
01:19:58,063 --> 01:19:59,063
Sarah, don’t be afraid.

1050
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:00,690
I’m with you, don’t be afraid.

1051
01:20:01,817 --> 01:20:03,033
Let go of her hand.

1052
01:20:03,193 --> 01:20:04,360
Her mom might see you.

1053
01:20:05,487 --> 01:20:06,905
What are you
waiting for? Let go!

1054
01:20:07,114 --> 01:20:08,490
Let go of each
other’s hands. I'm—

1055
01:20:08,515 --> 01:20:09,807
- I’m getting angry.
- Beb?

1056
01:20:09,991 --> 01:20:11,868
Is Sarah there?

1057
01:20:12,119 --> 01:20:13,662
Just a moment, okay?

1058
01:20:13,870 --> 01:20:15,230
- I’m just fixing my hair.
- Go on.

1059
01:20:15,372 --> 01:20:17,165
Don’t be afraid.
Calm down, Sarah.

1060
01:20:17,290 --> 01:20:18,417
Damn you, don’t meddle.

1061
01:20:18,461 --> 01:20:19,501
I might get mad at you.

1062
01:20:19,502 --> 01:20:21,604
- Michael, what’s your problem?
- Think for yourself.

1063
01:20:21,629 --> 01:20:23,004
You’re such an idiot.
You’re so annoying.

1064
01:20:23,028 --> 01:20:24,071
Michael, put that down.

1065
01:20:24,256 --> 01:20:26,274
- Michael.
- What about us?

1066
01:20:26,299 --> 01:20:28,132
Michael, it doesn't have
to be like this.

1067
01:20:28,157 --> 01:20:29,177
- Michael, don’t.
- Stop!

1068
01:20:29,178 --> 01:20:30,344
Put her down now.

1069
01:20:30,345 --> 01:20:31,947
Answer my question.
What about us?

1070
01:20:31,972 --> 01:20:33,223
Michael, there's nothing
between you two.

1071
01:20:33,247 --> 01:20:34,498
Are you stupid?
We are!

1072
01:20:34,599 --> 01:20:35,641
No there isn't!

1073
01:20:35,666 --> 01:20:36,792
You’re so pushy!

1074
01:20:36,942 --> 01:20:40,364
What do you mean,
what about us? Shut up!

1075
01:20:40,963 --> 01:20:43,914
Isn’t it enough how you
already took advantage of me?

1076
01:20:44,794 --> 01:20:48,171
Enough, Michael.
Just stop already.

1077
01:20:48,196 --> 01:20:49,781
Michael?

1078
01:20:50,824 --> 01:20:52,868
My gown is beautiful.

1079
01:20:53,118 --> 01:20:54,578
Why is that man here?

1080
01:20:54,911 --> 01:20:57,371
You?
You really are stubborn.

1081
01:20:57,396 --> 01:20:59,492
I didn’t raise you like that.

1082
01:20:59,621 --> 01:21:03,093
- Mom, Michael raped me.
- What?

1083
01:21:04,063 --> 01:21:05,605
This is my answer!

1084
01:21:05,630 --> 01:21:07,214
Michael, let’s
talk this through.

1085
01:21:07,239 --> 01:21:08,824
Don’t put us through this.

1086
01:21:08,849 --> 01:21:10,176
- What, what?
- Michael...

1087
01:21:10,201 --> 01:21:12,492
- Shhh...
- Michael, put that thing down!

1088
01:21:12,637 --> 01:21:14,306
- Damn you, don’t interfere.
- Michael, put her down.

1089
01:21:14,330 --> 01:21:16,230
- Shut up.
- What’s happening, Michael?

1090
01:21:19,561 --> 01:21:21,484
- What's that?
- Michael, what did you do?

1091
01:21:28,059 --> 01:21:30,158
Mom!

1092
01:21:31,924 --> 01:21:34,634
I don't know which
hellhole you got out of!

1093
01:21:34,659 --> 01:21:36,995
Damn you, I’ll kill you!

1094
01:21:44,336 --> 01:21:45,712
Mom. Sorry, Mom.

1095
01:23:01,955 --> 01:23:05,166
There really are no
secrets to hide here.

1096
01:23:05,792 --> 01:23:07,252
All the trash

1097
01:23:07,627 --> 01:23:10,463
gets flushed by the
water into the alleys.

1098
01:23:11,423 --> 01:23:12,591
It’s flooded again.

1099
01:23:13,675 --> 01:23:17,429
Just a bit of rain and the
drainage gets clogged right away.

1100
01:23:18,221 --> 01:23:19,221
Bummer.

1101
01:23:20,056 --> 01:23:22,684
I don’t even know
why I came home.

1102
01:23:23,727 --> 01:23:24,936
Shit.
