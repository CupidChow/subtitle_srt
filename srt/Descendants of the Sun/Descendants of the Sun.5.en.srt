1
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:12,662
You look like you really
want to drink this!

2
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,870
It's not like there is no other way.

3
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,474
Sleep well.

4
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:34,945
You let me have this, so...

5
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,200
He was a fellow soldier.

6
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,676
We did three joint operations
alongside each other.

7
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:12,550
So that means... So
Captain Yoo, you, too...

8
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,187
So let's not... talk about that.

9
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,119
Drop the gun.

10
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,426
Have you been well without
causing problems?

11
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,061
Can't you tell?

12
00:02:58,395 --> 00:03:01,450
Couldn't you have called to let me
know that you were coming or going?

13
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:05,400
Three months in Libya and a month
with Chen Kang in North Urk.

14
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,760
That's just great. Going to
all the dangerous places.

15
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,072
It's the most dangerous right here.

16
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,509
There hasn't been any place more dangerous
than here with a wife who's holding a gun.

17
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,978
Did you come back with Chen Kang?

18
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,350
Chen Kang's gone back to
the place he came from.

19
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:22,385
When?

20
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,490
Solar energy generation is not at
all harmful to the environment

21
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,415
and is a perfect installation
for the advancement of earth.

22
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:57,087
It was started after the war in Urk
as a gesture of peace keeping.

23
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:03,093
And since our Haesung is first in the
world in solar energy development,

24
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:07,364
we rightfully won the power
plant construction contract

25
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,840
leaving Germany in the dust.

26
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:10,980
Hello.

27
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,736
Hi. Hello.

28
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:16,510
When I come to a foreign place like
this and see signs written in Korean,

29
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,280
I get emotional for no reason.

30
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:21,177
Everyone's a patriot when
they leave their country.

31
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:24,614
It's amazing. I wish
I could go up there.

32
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,752
Doesn't it look great?

33
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,290
Manager Koo.

34
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,024
What? Oh. Excuse me.

35
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,627
Our chief manager is here.

36
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,366
I'm not part of Haesung,

37
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,630
but I'm chief manager of Urk's
power supply works, Mr. Jin.

38
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,520
Full name, Young Soo Jin, English name,

39
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:50,607
Receipt?

40
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,650
Richard. Jin Young Soo. Jin Young Soo.

41
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,888
Let's just do it in Korean style
and say Chief Manager Jin.

42
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,825
Exactly, so call me by my
proper name and title.

43
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:14,980
I'm not like Manager Koo here who does
physical labor as part of his job,

44
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,966
but someone who comes to the
site to supervise all the work

45
00:05:16,966 --> 00:05:19,402
done as part of Urk's main
office of power supply works.

46
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,572
I'm the chief officer in charge.
That'll be me.

47
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:27,677
Team leaders or professors who will be
able to converse with me on my level,

48
00:05:27,844 --> 00:05:30,580
who might that upper class person be?

49
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,288
Aren't there any professors?

50
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,759
Yes. It's me.

51
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:45,528
Sunbae, I have good news and bad news.

52
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:46,730
Good news first.

53
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,165
You know that little kid
from the lead town?

54
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,101
I found our his name. It's Bleki.

55
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,404
Well done! How about the bad news?

56
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,506
That Bleki has disappeared.

57
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:57,907
What?

58
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,978
When did you last see him?

59
00:06:02,645 --> 00:06:05,515
5 o'clock. After checking the IV fluid
had gone in completely,

60
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,051
I went to go get something
to eat for a sec...

61
00:06:08,752 --> 00:06:10,987
He left this behind.

62
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,324
I think it's something along the
lines of, "I'm going home."

63
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,694
-Should we go out and find him?
-Are you Tarzan?

64
00:06:18,061 --> 00:06:20,910
We're surrounded by mountains and water.
Where do we find him?

65
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,099
-I was going to ask Captain Yoo for help...
-Why?

66
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,201
You can't. Don't even dream of it.

67
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,670
He's already here.

68
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,480
Let me see the map.

69
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,950
Here it is. This is what Bleki drew.

70
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,219
Bleki drew the map?

71
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:46,823
Yes, do you know where this is?

72
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,760
Environmental Monkey Forrest,
next to it is the Cat's Rock.

73
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:55,231
Bleki is the name of the village.
This village.

74
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,040
Bleki was the name of the village?

75
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,804
In the end you didn't
even find out his name?

76
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,639
Clench your teeth!

77
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,310
I'll go find him. I'll take
responsibility and go look for him.

78
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,146
Is this really far?

79
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,683
The kids from there sometimes
come here for snacks,

80
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,718
but it takes around half
a day to walk here.

81
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,822
That won't do.

82
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:22,210
You take care of today's checkup appointments
at the power plant with Dr. Song.

83
00:07:22,325 --> 00:07:23,390
I will look for the kid.

84
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,370
By yourself?

85
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:27,397
Relax your jaw. How can
I find him by myself!

86
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,799
I have to go with someone
who knows the way.

87
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,969
I'll be asking for a favor.

88
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:39,175
Let's leave in ten minutes.

89
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,588
Please look in front of you, you'll
get into an accident if you don't.

90
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,695
We should be able to find him
since this is the only road.

91
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:00,897
Thank goodness.

92
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,802
Were you able to get some sleep?

93
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,204
You didn't allow me to sleep.

94
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,690
About last night...

95
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,612
I'm avoiding that topic, but it
seems like you haven't noticed.

96
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,047
Why are you avoiding it?

97
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,517
Because I'm confused.

98
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,353
Until I can sort out my feelings,

99
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,755
I'm going to try to avoid
it as much as possible.

100
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,859
Avoiding is fine and getting
angry is fine, too,

101
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,129
but I hope you don't think
you've been attacked.

102
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,900
I had gathered up my courage after
thinking about a thousand times.

103
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,687
There goes the kid.

104
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,631
Once in the morning.

105
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,904
Once in the evening. Okay?

106
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:17,040
Thank you, thank you.

107
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,143
They said thank you, right?

108
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,880
It would've been weird if she had
said "Get lost!" in this situation.

109
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:32,021
Aren't those the kids who were
collecting things before?

110
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,556
You have a good memory.

111
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:36,125
That's why I can't forget things easily.

112
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,093
Forget what?

113
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,162
Everything.

114
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:43,933
So don't say or do
anything memorable to me.

115
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:58,815
Are all the supplies for deployed
soldiers the highest quality like this?

116
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,951
So you don't feel inferior in front
of people from other countries,

117
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,710
the big companies from our
country supplied them for free.

118
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,791
-Wow. I will use them with a thankful heart.
-Okay.

119
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,695
Is the Commander well?

120
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,731
He is healthy.

121
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,835
It seems like I do have
a fate with Commander.

122
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:22,872
I get to meet you at a deployment.

123
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,920
I apologize, but I'll answer this
call briefly. It's an important call.

124
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:35,710
Answer it, you should answer it. That's what
phone are for. Is it the Commander?

125
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,087
It's an even more important call.
Power of unity.

126
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,124
It's me. Give me the report.

127
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,260
At 19:00, he ate dinner.

128
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:47,230
At 8PM, he went to the health club and exercised
with barbells, increasing weight by 5kg at a time.

129
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,330
At 21:00, he went into the internal affairs
office and bothered his colleagues.

130
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,934
At 22:30, the bathroom...

131
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,005
What about bothering his colleagues?

132
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:04,147
At 22:40, he is on-site.
We have locked eyes.

133
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,985
Really? Must be nice. Then what?

134
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:12,055
He's walking over towards me.

135
00:11:12,655 --> 00:11:15,358
One step... two steps...

136
00:11:18,728 --> 00:11:19,762
What should I do?

137
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,230
What should you do?

138
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,267
You should hang up. Hang up.

139
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,271
Since 1st Lt. Yoon is
a First Lieutenant...

140
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,830
and because you are
Sergeant First Class...

141
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,544
What is the first thing you do when
you are caught in your spy mission?

142
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,947
-Self destruction?
-You do whatever you are told to you, punk!

143
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,110
What did I tell you do?

144
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,618
I heard his voice for today.

145
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,955
Let's hang up now. Work hard.

146
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,124
Thank you. Power of unity.

147
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,227
I'm sorry.

148
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,210
-Kim Bum Lae.
-Sergeant Kim Bum Lae!

149
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,198
Will you run laps around the training
ground or will you make some ramen?

150
00:11:55,398 --> 00:11:56,899
I'll go make some ramen.

151
00:11:57,834 --> 00:12:00,770
But you have to make the
broth with yourself. Go!

152
00:12:01,671 --> 00:12:03,239
Then I'll wash up and come.

153
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,512
A letter came for you. Power of Unity!

154
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,500
Sorry, the good wine just came in.

155
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,230
Just let me know if you want some.

156
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,505
You certainly choose restaurants
according to men's tastes.

157
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,306
It is Sergeant First Class
Seo's favorite restaurant.

158
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:41,778
I like "The Great House of Taste" PX.
Instant foods are the best.

159
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,649
As if! Thanks for today, I'll buy.

160
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:48,317
Okay.

161
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:55,491
Since I'm treating, can I
ask you something personal?

162
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,430
I was curious but why did
you become a soldier?

163
00:13:02,598 --> 00:13:04,433
And not just about your
fantasy of soldier uniforms.

164
00:13:07,103 --> 00:13:09,005
Because somebody has to be a soldier.

165
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:18,581
You must not like my occupation.
And that's why you feel unsettled.

166
00:13:21,984 --> 00:13:25,655
I wondered how special your patriotism was
to the point you would sacrifice your life.

167
00:13:26,022 --> 00:13:27,089
What is patriotism?

168
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:32,110
Loving your nation and pledging your
allegiance to the nation and citizens.

169
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,830
Why must only soldiers do that?

170
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,304
I don't know what the patriotism
you are talking about, but

171
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,675
that faith to protect the children,
elderly and the pretty women,

172
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,845
the courage to be able to say
something to high schoolers...

173
00:13:49,478 --> 00:13:51,781
smoking in the streets even if you're scared to,

174
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,885
even when a gun is pointed to your
temple, knowing what's wrong is wrong,

175
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,956
that's how you uphold a soldier's honor.

176
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:04,493
That is the kind of
patriotism I think of.

177
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,872
Let me ask you something as well.

178
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:20,643
If I wasn't a soldier, but an
ordinary 2nd generation conglomerate,

179
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:23,546
would it have been easier for us?

180
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:28,918
No, because that's too ordinary.

181
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:34,557
That's right. I asked about ordinary
forgetting about being handsome.

182
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,975
Don't shoot! Don't shoot! I'm UN.

183
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,422
I paid the tab, let's go.

184
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,229
Can you find the hardware store
that we went to last time?

185
00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:17,466
You made sure I knew. Around
the corner, across the street.

186
00:15:17,967 --> 00:15:20,169
That's right. You can
get there alone, right?

187
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:23,630
Is there a problem? I need to get
back for the afternoon checkups.

188
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,643
Then borrow a car and go straight back to the base.
I will call the hardware store ahead of time.

189
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,445
Can I ask what it's about?

190
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:34,417
Something suddenly came up at the
headquarters. Thanks for the meal.

191
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:37,853
Is the head of the Arab issue not over yet?
Are you going there to get reprimanded again?

192
00:15:38,454 --> 00:15:41,390
It's true that I'm going there to be reprimanded
but I'm going there to write the report.

193
00:15:41,824 --> 00:15:44,660
We are also public
officers of peacekeepers.

194
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,028
And here I thought...

195
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:52,435
Go, I'll watch you.

196
00:15:57,306 --> 00:16:01,010
Are you here? Ye Hwa?

197
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,547
Is nobody here? Oh! Oh, you startled me!

198
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:07,350
Dr. Kang? Captain Yoo contacted me.

199
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:10,650
It's nice to meet you. I'm Kang Mo Yeon.

200
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,021
I'm Dr. Daniel.

201
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:16,559
Since I'm half Korean, my pronunciation is
funny, so while you hear it, you'll laugh.

202
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:18,494
So if it's funny, just laugh.

203
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,229
Your pronunciation is good.

204
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,898
But are you a doctor?

205
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:26,502
I perform surgeries and fix hardware.
Sometimes, I even deliver calves.

206
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,304
I heard you need a car.

207
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:39,382
I think we've met before.

208
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:42,485
You don't seem very surprised.

209
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:47,410
How is a peacekeeper threatening
an unarmed civilian with a gun?

210
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,657
That wouldn't do.

211
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:03,506
You're not a civilian.
You're not unarmed.

212
00:17:08,044 --> 00:17:10,813
I know you have connections
with the cops.

213
00:17:11,547 --> 00:17:14,417
Why do you keep showing up near me?

214
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,130
How many times do I have to tell you?

215
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:32,234
Aim to the back if you're
going to kill a man.

216
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:38,974
Cops. They're always on the side
of money. Always. Anywhere.

217
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,745
Long time, no see, Lieutenant.

218
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,651
Guess you're a Captain now?

219
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,990
Captain Agus?

220
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,763
Agus gangs? Okay, well let me know
if there's any problem. Okay, bye.

221
00:18:02,631 --> 00:18:06,502
It seems like there was some turmoil because
of gangs in this area. Here is the car key.

222
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:08,037
Was anyone injured?

223
00:18:08,137 --> 00:18:12,475
If they needed a doctor, they would have
contacted us. Would you like some tea?

224
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,443
Thank you.

225
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:25,421
But, how do you know Captain Yoo?

226
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:30,359
Well, how should I put it?
Maybe a member of memorial services?

227
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:36,732
In Iraq, in Afganistan, and even here in Urk, we
typically see each other at a memorial service.

228
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:43,172
I probably shouldn't be asking this,

229
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,675
but I don't think I'll have
another opportunity to.

230
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:53,716
Do you happen to know exactly what
kind of work Captain Yoo does?

231
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,454
First Lieutenant Yoo Si Jin.

232
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,625
Military ID 05-1051.

233
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,695
Special Forces Unit of the
Republic of Korean Army.

234
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:09,431
First Lieutenant Yoo Si Jin.

235
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,104
What's the UN's radio code?

236
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,640
Military ID 05-1051.

237
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:18,641
In English!

238
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:21,577
Special Forces Unit of the
Republic of Korean Army.

239
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,285
-Clear!
-Clear!

240
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:36,592
Allied force is safe. We
will proceed with our plan.

241
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:40,750
There is one more friendly soldier in the
basement. I think it's the missing Captain.

242
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,490
There is not enough time. Five minutes
later, this place will start exploding.

243
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,501
Since there is not enough
time, let's hurry up and go.

244
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,846
The Injured one has boarded.

245
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,382
Get on quickly! Let's go home.

246
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:22,838
Why are you...

247
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,140
Changed jobs, as you can see.

248
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,310
Now I can grow my hair out.

249
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,814
Luckily, the job is
pretty much the same.

250
00:20:32,848 --> 00:20:35,351
Shooting guns and making money.

251
00:20:36,018 --> 00:20:37,886
What happened to you?

252
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:41,624
Your code sign is still
legendary in Delta Force.

253
00:20:41,957 --> 00:20:43,459
Being a legend doesn't pay.

254
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,828
Listen carefully, Captain.

255
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:48,697
There are many bad gangs
in this neighborhood,

256
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:52,601
and they have no fear,
no rules, no honor.

257
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,204
They've got no country to serve.

258
00:21:00,142 --> 00:21:03,145
This is your last warning.
Mind your own business.

259
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:08,817
Even back then and now,
you're far too empathetic.

260
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:12,655
I guess so.

261
00:21:13,889 --> 00:21:16,325
I interfered with God's
will unnecessarily.

262
00:21:17,493 --> 00:21:19,161
Someone on the verge of death

263
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,598
must have had a reason to be.

264
00:21:22,998 --> 00:21:24,633
Do you hide behind your language?

265
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,903
For God's sake, piss of...

266
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:31,540
Don't you dare come near me,

267
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:37,880
or else you're going to
have to pay the price.

268
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,457
Is there anything more
you're curious about?

269
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:54,263
No. It's enough.

270
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:58,000
Enough to do what?

271
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:03,038
To understand or to keep your distance?

272
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:05,968
What do I do? What do I do?

273
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:08,604
Hello? Hello?

274
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,639
Captain Yoo?

275
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,109
You listened to me well.
You borrowed the car.

276
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:19,248
Where are you? I finished my
work and I'm about to leave.

277
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:24,052
Please save me! Please save me!

278
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:25,687
Where are you?

279
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,430
What do you see now? Tell
me anything you see.

280
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,929
The car... The car is
stuck on the cliff.

281
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,298
-Do you hear my voice?
-Yes.

282
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,934
Please wait just a moment.
I will go there.

283
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,736
I will find you.

284
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,817
Hello? Hello?

285
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:58,020
Yoo Si Jin. Don't hang up.

286
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,625
Please save me!

287
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,828
Is anyone there?

288
00:24:06,495 --> 00:24:08,297
Please save me!

289
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:16,905
So, Mom, don't cancel the
pension and savings account.

290
00:24:17,773 --> 00:24:20,976
Put in the rest of the money and
take them all out at the end.

291
00:24:22,411 --> 00:24:25,981
I'm really sorry for saying mean things.

292
00:24:26,415 --> 00:24:28,083
I love you, Mom.

293
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:31,487
And...

294
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:36,758
You know that building I
signed a contract on?

295
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:40,462
Make sure you get a refund on it.

296
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:43,866
And send my regards to Tae Woon.

297
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,870
Tell them to live happily ever after.

298
00:24:48,637 --> 00:24:52,641
What is this? Why am I dying like this?

299
00:25:08,957 --> 00:25:10,859
-Yoo Si Jin!
-Don't move.

300
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,995
Open all the windows.

301
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,570
Why are you coming to the front? You'll
shift the weight and the car will fall!

302
00:25:21,737 --> 00:25:23,939
Lean back as much as possible.

303
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,241
The ground can't last anymore.

304
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,410
I'm going to make this car fall.

305
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,830
What did you say? I don't like it.
I won't do it.

306
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,720
-Look at me.
-I can't do it.

307
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,283
Look at me, Doctor Kang!

308
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:37,753
Look into my eyes.

309
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,825
Trust me and hold my hand tightly.

310
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,696
Just close your eyes for a moment.

311
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,966
I will save you. I promise.

312
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,968
I don't want to.

313
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,739
-Take your foot off the brake.
-I don't want to. I really can't!

314
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:38,847
Are you okay? You aren't hurt?

315
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:46,154
Cough some more. Are you hurt anywhere?

316
00:26:47,456 --> 00:26:49,291
Why wouldn't I be hurting?

317
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,260
You crazy guy.

318
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:54,563
Even if you saved us, how
could you do that to the car?

319
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:57,132
You're crazy. You've gone mad.

320
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,674
Oh, this is so unfair! What am I to do?

321
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,079
I'm okay,

322
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,950
and it looks like you're okay too,
since you have the strength to hit me.

323
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:16,685
Let's go.

324
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:20,989
Wait a moment. I can't get up.

325
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,725
I'm not a solider.

326
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,361
Do you know how scared I was?

327
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,930
I really thought I was going to die.

328
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,935
Can I send you off alone again?

329
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,638
Hanging onto the edge of a cliff
just for sending you off alone.

330
00:27:37,372 --> 00:27:40,442
If I had made you take a train
alone, where would you be?

331
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:46,848
Don't make me laugh, I
don't have the energy to.

332
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,434
Power of unity!

333
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:07,502
Work hard.

334
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,206
Put this on.

335
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,543
You can see through your clothes.

336
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:17,012
Why did you give this to me now?

337
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,847
Because I saw everything already.

338
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:23,585
I don't like other people seeing.
Rest well.

339
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:30,058
Hey! Hey!

340
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:39,701
What are you! Where's the boss!

341
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,849
Max has got a new owner.

342
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:57,252
But the deal still stays the same.

343
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:00,789
I don't care.

344
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,126
As long as I get my money.

345
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:08,930
Here.

346
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:22,377
Is it because all Korean
men go to the military?

347
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,349
They instantly feel like my brothers.

348
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:33,155
Next delivery within a week.

349
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:42,497
But it used to be ten days.

350
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,570
One week.

351
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,441
Yes.

352
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,500
You rotten kid.

353
00:29:56,510 --> 00:30:00,790
I know you like the back of my hand
and where you've been dozing off.

354
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,852
I said I don't want to work
after hours or get paid for it.

355
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:06,922
Are you the boss or the president?

356
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:10,759
If you're going to just do whatever you
want, then just resign, you useless kid.

357
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:15,330
Just you wait. When I go to Korea, I'm
reporting you to the Department of Labor!

358
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,234
Manager! Manager! Hurry, hurry! Hurry!

359
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,336
Safety first. Safety first.

360
00:30:22,504 --> 00:30:24,472
That guy came.

361
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:26,890
I got it, that son of...

362
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:31,070
You've worked hard, Chief Operator!

363
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:35,030
You could have asked me to do it,
but you personally came here.

364
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,652
You're very busy going in and
out because all the materials.

365
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,624
But I heard that after you got the text,
you came here by driving yourself.

366
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,464
That friend is at the office from now on

367
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,701
so don't worry about him and pay
attention to your own work.

368
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,170
Can you finish the project
if you work this way?

369
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:08,750
Blood?

370
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,976
I only have instant
coffee, is that okay?

371
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,045
Pervert.

372
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:48,790
Your undergarments earlier? The black?

373
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,259
It's navy.

374
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,795
Did you really think I wouldn't know?

375
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,565
What would you have been
if you weren't a soldier?

376
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:01,069
-Is that a question?
-I was just talking to myself.

377
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:06,975
If you need anti-anxiety medicine, let
me know, I'll prescribe it for you.

378
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,145
I'm sure you were scared, too.

379
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,981
And for me, of course
I was out of my mind.

380
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,654
Are you showing concern for me?

381
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:23,425
Of course I should. You're my lifesaver.

382
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:28,129
I have to save your life for
you to even care, this woman.

383
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,336
But earlier,

384
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:41,876
do you know that you risked
your life to save me earlier?

385
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,180
Didn't you ask me to save you?

386
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:50,051
Didn't you say this when we first met?

387
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:55,457
That you went into a stream
of bullets to save a comrade.

388
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:01,997
That story about
you saving Private Ryan.

389
00:33:03,765 --> 00:33:05,467
You weren't joking, were you?

390
00:33:09,437 --> 00:33:14,175
So did you save Private Ryan?

391
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,885
We have finished getting
on the helicopter.

392
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,322
Get on quickly. Let's go home!

393
00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:00,155
Hurry, Sunbaenim.

394
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:14,102
Sunbae, wait.

395
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,180
I did save him.

396
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:34,556
But what would have happened if I hadn't?
I regretted it for the first time today.

397
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:45,467
Earlier, when you sent me away first,

398
00:34:46,701 --> 00:34:48,303
you lied to me, didn't you?

399
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:51,439
Now that I think about it,

400
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:56,244
That person who came to save
me came to early, right?

401
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:00,081
Having some work to do was a lie, right?

402
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:07,021
The gunshots I heard from the hardware
store were yours, weren't they?

403
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,659
You must feel more confused now.

404
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:15,497
Can't you just trust it to me?

405
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,267
It's driving me crazy.

406
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:26,608
Since you're like this, it
gets more complicated for me.

407
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,352
The power went out because
they have to inspect it.

408
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,988
It'll come back in about thirty minutes.

409
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:51,399
If you try something funny
because I can't see, I'll shout.

410
00:35:56,290 --> 00:36:00,010
Thank you for saving me today.

411
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,643
You still better not try anything funny.

412
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:06,147
Okay, I'll watch myself.

413
00:36:21,796 --> 00:36:24,666
Were you looking at me
like that the whole time?

414
00:36:25,066 --> 00:36:26,601
Like what?

415
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,770
Not being able to take
your eyes off of me.

416
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:31,105
You've dated a lot of
women, haven't you?

417
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:36,310
There are always a lot of pretty
women around entertaining men.

418
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,548
Didn't you see the dark person
who's next to funny me?

419
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,230
In the mornings, you seem to be having
fun watching my soldiers run half naked.

420
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,754
That's my reason for living these days.

421
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,957
This is what I get for saving you.

422
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:53,720
But, what about the car? We probably
have to call the car repair center.

423
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:58,900
I already called and the car
will be ready tomorrow night.

424
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:27,195
Why couldn't you just save me without
putting the car in the water?

425
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:32,267
No. You saved me, but I'm
just complaining. Sorry.

426
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,420
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

427
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:38,470
I apologized already.

428
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,043
Just trust Daniel. There's
nothing he can't fix.

429
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,611
Really?

430
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:04,198
These are two-way radios. The Captain already
knows about them so I don't need to tell you.

431
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:05,740
Why two-way radios?

432
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,635
These are more convenient
than phones here.

433
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:11,406
And if the cellphone doesn't go
through like yesterday, it could bad.

434
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:18,613
Thank you. But how much will it be?

435
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,082
-This?
-No, the car.

436
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:24,850
I'll try my best.

437
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,120
Can you fix it?

438
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,691
Even if I can fix it, it
won't be the same as before.

439
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:34,395
I'm already thinking of things I couldn't do for
the car. It didn't get a proper painting either.

440
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:37,050
Or fill up on that premium
gasoline it loves.

441
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:40,935
Its okay. This radio may
be the last as well.

442
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,271
Say what you want to say right now.

443
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:51,079
The medical team can use channel seven
because its already preset on that channel.

444
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,880
And three is our channel.

445
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:58,853
And to talk, you push the PT
button here, and wait one second.

446
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:06,160
Big Boss is calling the medical team.

447
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,150
Is Big Boss your nickname?

448
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,298
It's a call sign. Did you choose yours?

449
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:13,167
Not yet. I'll be...

450
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:15,103
Cutie?

451
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:18,240
-You must be crazy.
-It resembles you though.

452
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:22,076
What? It's not that I'm
cute, I just resemble cute?

453
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,245
-Sort of.
-Sort of?

454
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:28,950
Geez.

455
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:32,220
May I interrupt your fun?

456
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:37,091
Why are you here? Weren't you
called out somewhere else?

457
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,061
I came here to marry you.

458
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:43,664
Hey, kid! What kind of joke is that?

459
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:47,568
Did I just scare Yoo Si Jin? Wow.

460
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,473
I'm officially reporting for duty.

461
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:55,290
First Lieutenant Yoon Myung
Ju, from 2015, May 28th,

462
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,979
has been assigned to the medic cube.

463
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,882
Reporting for duty. Power of unity.

464
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:07,188
I smell you abusing
your status right now.

465
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:11,692
My life in conflict with an unfair situation only
advantageous for me is not that easy either,

466
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,696
Then, you two talk together.

467
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:19,400
You should say your
greetings before you leave.

468
00:40:21,602 --> 00:40:24,038
Let's get along. And put
the past behind us.

469
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:30,411
I don't have any hands to handshake. And
I don't have any heart to forget either.

470
00:40:40,555 --> 00:40:44,720
I was curious since before, but what is the
relationship between you and Doctor Kang?

471
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:47,530
Did you meet Kang Mo
Yeon coincidentally here.

472
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:51,265
Or did you keep on meeting and met her
here as a disguise of coincidence?

473
00:40:52,266 --> 00:40:57,040
Am I you? And why are you calling her
Kang Mo Yeon? She's your unni and sunbae.

474
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:59,370
How long have you seen her
that you're taking her side?

475
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:02,210
Don't change the subject. What is
the relationship between you two?

476
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:06,414
Don't think of it as fate.
As a god, I reject it.

477
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:10,051
What kind of pedigree is this? I
thought you were here to marry me.

478
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:11,652
That's right.

479
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:13,855
Anyways.

480
00:41:43,284 --> 00:41:44,519
Is it very sick?

481
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:55,463
Commander had called and asked
me to take care of you.

482
00:41:56,697 --> 00:41:58,199
So are you going to be good to him?

483
00:41:58,466 --> 00:42:01,369
It's my goal to give you hardship
so that you leave on your own.

484
00:42:02,169 --> 00:42:03,638
We won't even be seeing
each other for that long.

485
00:42:05,139 --> 00:42:08,209
I heard that your departure was
pulled back because of my father.

486
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:11,612
Perhaps is that nepotism from Commander?

487
00:42:11,712 --> 00:42:14,482
Nepotism? This bastard.

488
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:18,319
It's consideration.
Consideration, bastard.

489
00:42:19,687 --> 00:42:24,525
Seems like the commander really loves his dream
son-in-law. How are you going to get away?

490
00:42:25,026 --> 00:42:26,427
That's why I should do well.

491
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:29,610
If it weren't for me,
you'd be married to me.

492
00:42:30,731 --> 00:42:32,833
Should I forget everything
and just get married?

493
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,169
Are you threatening me right now?

494
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:40,341
I'm sorry. I hated you.

495
00:42:44,712 --> 00:42:49,450
Did you contact Sergeant
First Class yet?

496
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:53,120
Do you think I did? He doesn't answer.

497
00:42:54,622 --> 00:42:56,123
He doesn't answer your call?

498
00:42:57,024 --> 00:42:58,526
He answered mine.

499
00:43:00,261 --> 00:43:02,496
He called me a lot.

500
00:43:03,898 --> 00:43:05,800
-Yeah, Sergeant Seo.
-Did he answer?

501
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,804
Why didn't you answer?

502
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:14,976
He doesn't answer. Do you
want to leave a voice mail?

503
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:23,684
I will give you 1 minute
to hit all targets.

504
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:26,854
Shoot accurately. Start.

505
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:27,955
Start.

506
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:52,346
There are three things to a command.

507
00:43:55,290 --> 00:44:00,087
When the higher ups say to
attack, there is only advance.

508
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:05,760
When the higher ups say to
defend, there is only defend.

509
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:09,096
At the command to standby,

510
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:18,639
you got three shots.

511
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:44,398
There must be no movement when
there is a command to wait.

512
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:46,367
That is a command.

513
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:49,737
A command is before a soldier's life.

514
00:44:50,404 --> 00:44:54,742
This is the Special Force
Unit's duty you have chosen.

515
00:44:58,010 --> 00:44:59,013
Unity!

516
00:45:00,748 --> 00:45:02,383
It is the Commander's call.

517
00:45:03,584 --> 00:45:05,619
That is all.

518
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:07,588
-You're dismissed.
-Dismissed!

519
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:11,092
Do you see anyone that's a
candidate for the Alpha team?

520
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,661
I will report back once the training
is over and see how many there are.

521
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:19,633
As your old nickname was Officer of Hell,
make sure to run those trainings well.

522
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:26,650
Yoo Si Jin made some complications, so

523
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:30,177
you should start stacking some
experience and power under your belt.

524
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:33,314
Yes, I understand.

525
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:41,088
I was told that the order I gave was
unjust. What are your thoughts?

526
00:45:42,223 --> 00:45:43,891
I agree with First Lieutenant Yoon.

527
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:49,600
Just do the investigation correctly.
You can accuse freely.

528
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:50,831
There's no reason for that.

529
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:57,471
-I lost this fight.
-Is that so?

530
00:45:57,620 --> 00:46:01,008
You have a weapon I
cannot fight against.

531
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:03,310
It's sincerity.

532
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,782
You sincerely worry about
Lieutenant Colonel Yoo's future.

533
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:11,652
With all my sincerity, you
said that I'm not the one.

534
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:17,758
So I think the same with you.

535
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,995
That is the reason I lost this fight.

536
00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:25,833
For Lieutenant Colonel Yoo, I will lose.

537
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:41,782
With the heart that I hope you don't
read this letter, I write this letter.

538
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:49,957
If you are reading this letter, it means
that we are in a difficult situation.

539
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:54,295
It means that Father
commanded you to run away.

540
00:46:57,950 --> 00:47:02,036
I'm sorry because I was a
girl blocking a guy's path.

541
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:06,907
But I still ask about how you're doing.

542
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:10,611
And you don't answer.

543
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:14,448
So we're probably far
away from each other.

544
00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:24,058
I'm sorry for running to you
although I knew this would happen.

545
00:47:25,490 --> 00:47:27,494
For embracing you with all my heart.

546
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:35,135
I should have hold your hand more.
I should have hugged you more.

547
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:42,276
Because I regret. Because
I still love you.

548
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,915
It's fine if you never
hear this confession,

549
00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:51,285
So I wish we were together in Urk.

550
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:53,921
So what happened to us?

551
00:47:54,740 --> 00:48:00,294
Did we meet? Or did we break up again?

552
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:09,970
Excuse me!

553
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:13,874
You're the new army surgeon, right?

554
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,512
An intern from the Haesung Hospital?

555
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:21,649
I look young, right? I have
been a one year resident.

556
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:26,420
I'm curious about something.
I have to go the army soon.

557
00:48:27,390 --> 00:48:29,140
Do they give guns to army surgeons?

558
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:30,491
An army surgeon is a solider as well.

559
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:33,994
Oh... Then what if a war happens?

560
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:36,563
You don't treat the enemy's soldier?

561
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,666
An army surgeon is a doctor too.

562
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:40,901
That's so cool.

563
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:44,271
Are you flirting right now?

564
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:47,708
What? It's misunderstanding.

565
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:52,046
I wanted to know what the
dilemma of an army surgeon was.

566
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:56,083
And most of all, you're not that pretty.

567
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,018
Me?

568
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:02,656
My goodness. Look at how
Doctor Lee has high standards.

569
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:04,158
So nice.

570
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,327
-Break up.
-Yes.

571
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:10,590
Haesung Group is just as I heard.
What are all those?

572
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,633
Can you make sure if it's
a fight or a question?

573
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:15,900
Its not like you do any major work. You're only
here for month and you just vaccinate people.

574
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:19,440
Did you pack up and bring all
that just to take a few pictures?

575
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:23,711
Are you trying to pack your child's
picnic lunch in a designer bag?

576
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:27,710
Thank you for making an analogy
with a luxury bag but...

577
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,183
I made an analogy of a lunch box.

578
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:36,657
That is all something
called a Medi Cube.

579
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:39,940
The reason why we packed all of that
for just a month of work is because

580
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:44,060
we were going to leave it with the UN.
Is there a problem with that?

581
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:46,066
I don't know if this is
a question or a fight.

582
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,569
Then, because I'm busy.

583
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:53,107
That rude girl!

584
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:54,441
She can hear you.

585
00:49:54,650 --> 00:49:58,479
I said that so she could hear us. Look at her
go pretending that she didn't hear anything.

586
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:02,349
I won. Let's go.

587
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:06,053
Are you sure you won?

588
00:50:06,854 --> 00:50:09,490
Why did you win? At
which part did you win?

589
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:12,950
Please stock up on bioflor
and enterol in the pharmacy.

590
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,963
The on-call duty for
the night will be...

591
00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:18,260
Is there anyone who will
do it instead of me?

592
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:19,170
There isn't.

593
00:50:19,333 --> 00:50:22,403
If there isn't, I will do it.

594
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:26,940
We will end the meeting here.
Any questions?

595
00:50:30,377 --> 00:50:33,881
Why did we have a meeting here
instead of the Medi Cube?

596
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:37,951
Anyone who would take this out
and place it in the Medicube?

597
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:41,221
No one.

598
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:48,762
This is cube B. Come out, Pretty One.

599
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:50,931
This is actually really fun.

600
00:50:52,030 --> 00:50:53,600
The Pretty One is here. Over.

601
00:50:53,830 --> 00:50:56,136
What is today's lunch menu, over?

602
00:50:56,430 --> 00:50:58,338
I'll check and let you know, over.

603
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:03,243
I'll tell you the lunch
menu so, Pretty One,

604
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:07,581
Let's talk for a second, over.

605
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:10,150
Pretty one, work hard.

606
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:26,633
Talk about what? Can you
talk to me like this?

607
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:28,335
Why not?

608
00:51:28,602 --> 00:51:30,804
It's not respectful to the
woman who came to marry you.

609
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:33,407
Where are you going? I said
I have something to say.

610
00:51:33,407 --> 00:51:34,808
I don't have anything to say.

611
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:42,749
About Captain Yoo and
Team Leader Kang...

612
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:45,452
There is definitely something
going on between them, right?

613
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:46,887
What is going on between them?

614
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:49,056
Like something that's in between us.

615
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:51,740
Something between us? Unsatisfaction?

616
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:52,860
Unsatisfaction?

617
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:59,233
Ha Ja Ae suffer. Ha Ja Ae suffer.
Be messy.

618
00:52:04,738 --> 00:52:06,673
He has the mentality of an
elementary school student.

619
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:11,860
Close it up already. It
won't be able to run again.

620
00:52:11,979 --> 00:52:14,014
Don't give it a death
sentence so easily.

621
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:15,749
That's up to the doctor.

622
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:23,157
Seeing you like that make you really
seem like a metal shop owner.

623
00:52:23,370 --> 00:52:25,459
I am a real metal shop owner.

624
00:52:26,293 --> 00:52:32,466
I personally think that you are
sexier when you hold a scalpel.

625
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,205
But you know only Asians think that.

626
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:42,476
In the West, with overalls and
a screwdriver, it's game over.

627
00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:46,480
Where did you learn those weird things?

628
00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:01,295
The car door. Bring the car door to me.

629
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:12,639
This is Handsome Spaceman.
Handsome Spaceman.

630
00:53:12,906 --> 00:53:14,280
Headquarters, respond!

631
00:53:14,290 --> 00:53:16,743
Roger. This is the headquarters.
What is happening?

632
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:23,750
It's not looking good. We're
short on liquid salonpas!

633
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:28,422
Calm down. Hold on for a bit longer.

634
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:31,900
I'll deliver it airborne
without delay, over.

635
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:34,494
Copy that. I'll wait to the end.

636
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:37,998
-Catch it airborne.
-Yes.

637
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:44,137
Clear.

638
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:50,978
This is Handsome Spaceman. Can
girl group Pretty One hear me?

639
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:55,282
We need a performance
of encouragement, over.

640
00:53:58,590 --> 00:53:59,987
Alright, over.

641
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:07,427
This the girl group Pretty One who just
came back from a tour in Southeast Asia.

642
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,340
What's with the cake?
Is today a special day?

643
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:16,363
Come this way. I was
about to come get you.

644
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:17,580
It's for a farewell.

645
00:55:17,664 --> 00:55:19,700
Ah, who is the farewell for?

646
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:21,735
It's a farewell for the
Company Commander.

647
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:23,804
If it's the company commander...

648
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:28,140
Captain Yoo?

649
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:31,712
Yes, the company commander's term
is over so he is leaving tomorrow.

650
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:42,456
How could he do this without a word?
Gosh, really...

651
00:55:44,330 --> 00:55:45,826
How could he do this?

652
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:57,070
Ammunition Team 20:30 Changing shift.

653
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:59,973
I'll continue on duty, roger.

654
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:10,016
Yoo Si Jin, how can a person be
like this? How can you be so...

655
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:13,200
-How can he just go without a word?
-I am talking.

656
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:14,354
Oh my! Shocked me!

657
00:56:14,588 --> 00:56:17,924
Anyone who can locate Team
Leader Kang, report to me.

658
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:25,298
I am here! Why?

659
00:56:26,032 --> 00:56:26,733
Doctor Kang?

660
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:29,736
Why are you listening to the
military channel, Doctor Kang?

661
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:31,538
Are you a spy?

662
00:56:32,539 --> 00:56:35,342
Let's meet up. Where is "here?"

663
00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:40,981
I am departing tomorrow.

664
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:43,316
I heard that you heard already.

665
00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:51,691
It seems like you are. I'm
the last one to hear it.

666
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:56,730
I tried to tell you yesterday
morning, but you ran away.

667
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:58,131
Do you remember?

668
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:00,801
Then you should have held on to me.

669
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:04,320
As a person who saved Private
Ryan, you should've held onto me.

670
00:57:04,330 --> 00:57:06,239
That you're angry,

671
00:57:07,941 --> 00:57:10,744
I don't really know, but I think
its a little advantageous of me.

672
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:12,660
Is that right?

673
00:57:12,746 --> 00:57:13,780
You are wrong.

674
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:22,689
Are your feelings still
complicated, Doctor Kang?

675
00:57:31,298 --> 00:57:32,098
I see.

676
00:57:34,130 --> 00:57:37,904
Let me ask you one thing.
This might be the last time.

677
00:57:41,870 --> 00:57:43,540
About the time when I kissed
you without your consent.

678
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:44,900
I told you not to bring that up until...

679
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:46,112
What should I do?

680
00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:54,321
Should I apologize or should I confess?

681
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:43,503
He went with Doctor Kang

682
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:47,140
I missed you so what can I do?
Can I ask you something?

683
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:50,377
Can I ask you something? Do you
like Si Jin Sunbae by any chance?

684
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,270
Where are you right now, Captain Yoo?

685
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:54,814
Company Commander left last night.

686
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:58,652
There was a strong earthquake
measuring magnitude of 6.7.

687
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:00,890
The power plant has
completely collapsed.

688
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:04,540
We aren't able to confirm the
state of the Medical Team.

689
00:59:04,658 --> 00:59:08,010
I hate Yoo Si Jin. It's not
like I can beg him not to go.

690
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:09,629
I'm Alpha Team Captain Yoo Si Jin.

691
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:14,601
Connect me to someone who can negotiate.
Don't hang up. Do it now.
