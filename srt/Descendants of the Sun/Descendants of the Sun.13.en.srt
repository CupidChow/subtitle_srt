1
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:04,605
It's a good day.

2
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:06,006
Good morning.

3
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:08,809
I think my job is too far.

4
00:00:08,957 --> 00:00:11,928
I liked it when the Medicube
was right outside my dorm.

5
00:00:12,044 --> 00:00:14,464
And we appreciated the
"doves" every morning.

6
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:15,849
Let's go together.

7
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,150
Hello.

8
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:21,121
But, doesn't it seem like
it's our first day of work?

9
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,807
Right? Me, too.

10
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,994
I feel like that, too. Ow, it's cold.

11
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:28,678
Good morning.

12
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:31,999
We're really back.

13
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:36,904
Did you guys sleep well?

14
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:38,500
I was at Urk the whole night.

15
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:40,407
There was an earthquake and
an epidemic outbreak...

16
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:45,913
"Welcome! Haesung Hospital's
Urk Medical Team."

17
00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:48,915
"We are proud of your spirit of sharing."

18
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:59,293
Chairman, you came all the
way down here to welcome us...

19
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:00,794
Nobody is sick, right?

20
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,796
Yes, we're okay.

21
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:06,099
You come over here.

22
00:01:07,006 --> 00:01:08,001
It's so good to see him taking care of...

23
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:10,370
...Lee Chihoon,
even though I'm the one who greeted him.

24
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:14,524
Why didn't you come when we
told you to and make us suffer?

25
00:01:14,747 --> 00:01:18,745
Do you know how much your mother
came to the hospital everyday...

26
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:22,149
-...and bothered me?
-I wouldn't know.

27
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,955
Good work, everyone.

28
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:32,030
There will be a 100% bonus on top of
a special pay for all that you've done.

29
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,927
Everyone get a
comprehensive health exam.

30
00:01:34,883 --> 00:01:37,364
-It's his mom's suggestion.
-Yes.

31
00:01:37,478 --> 00:01:39,066
Everybody, let's get back to work.

32
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:40,567
Dismissed!

33
00:01:42,862 --> 00:01:45,055
Dismissed. Dismissed. You
guys are dismissed, too.

34
00:01:57,995 --> 00:02:00,114
It's heart-warming to see Kang
Moyeon getting the bouquet,

35
00:02:00,217 --> 00:02:01,114
even though I gave the formal greetings.

36
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:02,489
You, really!

37
00:02:03,221 --> 00:02:06,925
What would I do if you weren't in
the plane that I sent to get you.

38
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:11,098
After sending you like that, can you
imagine how uncomfortable I felt?

39
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:17,521
What is this?

40
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:19,406
Kang Moyeon!

41
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:24,611
I missed you so much!

42
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:30,851
At that moment, what I saw was
an explosion, like "Bam!"

43
00:02:30,945 --> 00:02:34,271
And everything crumbling down all of
a sudden. So everything became a mess.

44
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:37,741
My heart started beating fast
and my mind became blank.

45
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:40,327
What is she saying?

46
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:41,841
She is talking about the earthquake.

47
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:44,915
Earthquake? Isn't that the
moment you fell in love?

48
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:48,135
Oh, that's right. Hey, did you spread the
news in the hospital that I'm dating?

49
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:50,837
Oh, when I arrived in Korea,
the news had already spread.

50
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:52,360
Then who could it be?

51
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,841
What's so important about who did it?
It's the truth anyway.

52
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,309
Just tell me about that man.

53
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:59,046
How is it dating a
special force's soldier?

54
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:02,816
What to do when your car
is hanging off of a cliff,

55
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,618
how to get out of a mine field,

56
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,421
the correct posture of a hostage
who is wearing a bomb vest...

57
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,122
You get to learn those things.

58
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,991
What is she saying?

59
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:12,626
This is hard even for me.

60
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:15,712
Even I didn't know this genre
would interfere in my life.

61
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:23,136
Are you happy to be in Korea?

62
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:25,338
I'm still a bit out of it.

63
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:27,901
I miss Urk too.

64
00:03:29,102 --> 00:03:32,272
There are no "doves" who sing
military songs in the morning here.

65
00:03:32,372 --> 00:03:33,889
And you aren't here either.

66
00:03:33,973 --> 00:03:37,360
Is what you miss the
"doves" or the Captain?

67
00:03:37,661 --> 00:03:39,286
Peace of Urk.

68
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:41,154
That's what I'm talking about.

69
00:03:46,255 --> 00:03:48,128
Are you starting to get busy now?

70
00:03:48,247 --> 00:03:49,945
In order to get back to the
position you were in before?

71
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,566
No, I'm going to resign.
I should open up my own business.

72
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,634
I even put in a deposit for a building.

73
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:57,337
What is a captain's salary?

74
00:03:57,471 --> 00:03:59,505
If I go broke, can you feed me?

75
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:02,776
Hello?

76
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,227
Hello?

77
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:08,131
Ah, this is strange. Why
does it feel so far?

78
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:11,151
It seems our relationship became as far!

79
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:12,335
I'm hanging up!

80
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:16,957
If you become broke, I'll secure you
a position in the Alpha Team,

81
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:19,159
so don't you worry, Dr. Kang.

82
00:04:20,955 --> 00:04:23,964
You have more real field experience
than a typical active duty soldier.

83
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,066
Transmission received.

84
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,068
I won't go broke so don't worry.

85
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:30,253
I'm a girl who has even
crossed a mine field.

86
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:35,942
-I have something to say.
-I'll go first.

87
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,644
-I'm sorry, but...
-On that day...

88
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:41,047
To be precise, on that day in the hotel,

89
00:04:41,946 --> 00:04:43,350
I was thoughtless.

90
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:48,355
I thought I was someone who
was entitled to do that,

91
00:04:49,054 --> 00:04:49,887
But,

92
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,760
it didn't work on my Moyeon. Actually,
I was so flustered because of it.

93
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,731
So you are saying,

94
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:00,850
I'm the first woman who hit you?

95
00:05:01,122 --> 00:05:04,337
Wow, you really are incredulous.

96
00:05:04,802 --> 00:05:06,373
Look here, Mr. Han Seokwon.

97
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,892
Mr. Han Seokwon?

98
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:12,579
Didn't I tell you that I would resign
as soon as I came back to Korea?

99
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:14,881
If I do this,

100
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:17,049
you won't be a chairman to me anymore.

101
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:23,156
Well, I have no intention of letting
you go, so what shall we do?

102
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,759
You resigning is a way, too, Chairman.

103
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:32,299
Do you have to go this far?

104
00:05:33,178 --> 00:05:34,968
How can a person be so harsh?

105
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:36,970
Are you Moyeon because you are hard?

106
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,472
Are you Han Seokwon because
you have nothing better to do?

107
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:43,259
Within this week, I request that
you accept this resignation.

108
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:48,148
Ah, that arrogance!

109
00:05:48,611 --> 00:05:50,016
I like it so much!

110
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:53,520
But why? Why all of a sudden?

111
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,991
I was told that all I had to do was sign
to get the loan. So why won't it work?

112
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,992
I am sorry, Miss.

113
00:05:59,105 --> 00:06:00,994
The last time you
consulted about the loan,

114
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:03,196
you were a doctor at
Haesung Hospital VIP ward.

115
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:04,197
But now,

116
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:07,500
you are just a licensed doctor
who wants to open a new business.

117
00:06:08,095 --> 00:06:11,104
So, in reality, you are unemployed.

118
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:15,792
So what you are saying is that if
I quit my job at the hospital,

119
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:17,811
I can't get a loan?

120
00:06:18,514 --> 00:06:20,630
That's correct, Miss.

121
00:06:22,607 --> 00:06:23,516
Then,

122
00:06:23,872 --> 00:06:25,848
what should I do now?

123
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,255
Why are you asking me...

124
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:31,057
Yes, next customer, please.

125
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:36,755
What do you want me to do?

126
00:06:36,851 --> 00:06:39,332
I want Yoon Myeongju
to live comfortably.

127
00:06:40,707 --> 00:06:43,603
Just because you open up your own clinic
doesn't mean you will live comfortably.

128
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,722
Do you know how many
hospitals fold nowadays?

129
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:48,625
So, you will continue
to be an Army Surgeon?

130
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:55,448
What soldiers need is not
a complicated surgery.

131
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:58,167
The most important thing is
to give accurate diagnostics...

132
00:06:58,262 --> 00:07:00,954
...in a closed environment so
the illness doesn't get worse.

133
00:07:04,196 --> 00:07:05,892
Quick diagnostics as a doctor,

134
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:09,195
warm consideration as a soldier,
and I'm very good at both.

135
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:12,299
I like that job of a
doctor and of a soldier.

136
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:16,202
If an army surgeon like me leaves
the army, it's a national loss.

137
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:18,004
Don't you agree?

138
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,306
I got it.

139
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:22,008
I will correct myself.

140
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,105
I am sorry to be interrupting
during your date,

141
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,515
but I have a message to deliver.

142
00:07:30,738 --> 00:07:33,532
You always have a tendency to
deliver in a moment like this.

143
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,522
This is the most rewarding
job as of lately.

144
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:37,824
Take this.

145
00:07:40,486 --> 00:07:41,895
It's a transfer order.

146
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,998
-Are you talking about Lieutenant Yoon?
-Yes.

147
00:07:45,718 --> 00:07:47,935
She will be returning to Korea with you.

148
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:49,736
Really?

149
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,554
What happened?

150
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,029
Is this my father's doing?

151
00:07:54,124 --> 00:07:56,125
Why are you bringing up the Commander?

152
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:59,212
It is an order from the Lieutenant
Colonel and my connection.

153
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,315
What kind of connection do you have, when
you can't even take care of yourself?

154
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,017
Oh, is that right?

155
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:07,354
Then, should I prove if I
have any connection or not,

156
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,457
by canceling the transfer order?

157
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:13,250
My girlfriend has recently
suffered from an epidemic,

158
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,128
so she can't think straight.

159
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:18,031
But how did you do it anyway?

160
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:21,801
Even though she is recovered,

161
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:24,796
she will need stability and rest,

162
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:26,890
-so I'm worried if she will be
okay in a foreign country.

163
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,008
So...

164
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:32,044
You think it's best to send
Lieutenant Yoon to Korea?

165
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,550
Well, when she was sick and
was on the brink of death,

166
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:42,489
you said to send her to the U.S.
Army hospital.

167
00:08:42,592 --> 00:08:44,391
If she finds out about that,

168
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:48,695
wouldn't she feel disappointed?

169
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:52,098
Hey, Yoo Shijin!

170
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,800
Speak truthfully!

171
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,504
Are you threatening me right now?

172
00:08:57,804 --> 00:09:00,774
If this is a threat right now...

173
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:03,276
it worked.

174
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,095
What do I do now?

175
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,282
If you consider a parent's heart...

176
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,085
Right? Even if he wanted
to, the Commander wouldn't

177
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,588
be able to ask her back home
because there are other eyes.

178
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:17,490
I didn't even think about that,

179
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,126
but you are so thoughtful.

180
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,206
-Do you miss me that much?
-Save me!

181
00:09:34,439 --> 00:09:35,442
Where are you?

182
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:36,843
What happened?

183
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:39,446
They said I can't get a loan.

184
00:09:41,198 --> 00:09:43,383
I threw a letter of resignation
at the Chairman's face...

185
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:45,819
...in a cool manner with a
bang and went to the bank.

186
00:09:47,057 --> 00:09:49,556
What do I do? I can't get a loan.

187
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:55,011
So, you didn't consider going to the
bank prior to giving your resignation?

188
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,529
What did you say?

189
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,932
"I turned in my resignation
in a cool manner...

190
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:00,633
...but what if I'm not
able to get a loan?"

191
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,938
Was it too much of a challenge
to think it through?

192
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:06,653
Can't you request an extension of duty?

193
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:09,442
Why come to Korea to see
such a short-sighted woman?

194
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:12,145
Don't come back. Continue
living there happily.

195
00:10:12,284 --> 00:10:13,335
I'm hanging up!

196
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:17,083
Why? Captain Yoo isn't coming after all?

197
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:18,384
What a shame!

198
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:20,294
Captain Yoo would be able to quickly go

199
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,844
and get the resignation letter that's
upstairs in the Director's office.

200
00:10:22,939 --> 00:10:24,527
Just go and plead.

201
00:10:24,741 --> 00:10:27,694
How can I go and plead
after making such a scene?

202
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:33,869
So then there's a professor's
position available. Sweet.

203
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,171
Then are you going to
continue appearing on TV?

204
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,936
Wow you're seriously something.

205
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:55,021
Is there something down here?

206
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:57,824
I wish there was.

207
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:04,397
Should we try laughing
like it was a joke?

208
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,398
No.

209
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,432
Okay.

210
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,501
I wonder if all of the
Urk Medical Service Team....

211
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:11,395
...need to go through
Psychological Assessment.

212
00:11:11,488 --> 00:11:14,507
Are you using the calamity as an
excuse for your abnormal mindset?

213
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:16,776
This is nothing to laugh about.

214
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:19,379
You won't be able to get
one since you resigned.

215
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,299
Just continue volunteering.
You can live volunteering.

216
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:26,373
You were very beautiful and
brilliant while volunteering.

217
00:11:27,365 --> 00:11:30,390
I've made a decision after
hearing your advice.

218
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:31,558
I'm leaving.

219
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:35,862
I'm such an influential person.
But where are you going?

220
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:41,467
I've considered my eight
years with Haesung Hospital.

221
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:44,370
From an internship to a
professor, Haesung has been...

222
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,273
...my life, my reason for
living and a part of me.

223
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:51,044
My goodness, why are you being
like this President Kang?

224
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:53,746
You're so witty.

225
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:56,249
I guess the loan wasn't possible
without a permanent job?

226
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,635
I'm sorry to disturb you, Chairman.

227
00:11:59,741 --> 00:12:01,321
If you would give me another chance,

228
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,241
I will put my everything for
Haesung Hospital VIP ward...

229
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:07,043
Forget about the VIP ward and go to
the Emergency department as of today.

230
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,863
Did you say Emergency Department?

231
00:12:11,739 --> 00:12:15,368
I also have some pride and don't
want to see you that comfortable.

232
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:19,032
You will be mostly on the night shift, and
you will always be the surgeon on call.

233
00:12:19,133 --> 00:12:20,240
It will be really difficult.

234
00:12:20,936 --> 00:12:24,244
What? Is this also my personal
revenge, abusing my authority?

235
00:12:24,681 --> 00:12:26,603
Oh, no.

236
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,681
You're words are extreme, Chairman.

237
00:12:28,801 --> 00:12:31,084
I consider the Emergency Department
like the flower of our hospital,

238
00:12:31,198 --> 00:12:33,886
so it's only fitting a
flower like myself go there.

239
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,788
That's good then.

240
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,097
If you don't like all
this, just come to me.

241
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:48,201
Instead of a VIP doctor,
I'll turn you into a VIP.

242
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:56,242
Thank you for always watching
over me with affection, Chairman.

243
00:12:59,021 --> 00:13:00,229
He was in a car accident,
but the other hospital...

244
00:13:00,332 --> 00:13:01,843
...says they couldn't perform the surgery.

245
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,332
They sent him to us.

246
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:04,717
Be careful with the line.

247
00:13:05,267 --> 00:13:08,087
Who did you call? We need
an order to book an OR.

248
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,856
Doctor, over here.

249
00:13:11,981 --> 00:13:13,493
Chief Resident,
hurry secure an operating room.

250
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,210
Yes.

251
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,298
-Please give him more blood.
-Okay.

252
00:13:18,395 --> 00:13:19,799
-Get another line on him.
-Okay.

253
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:22,101
-What are you doing here without a gown?
-Exactly.

254
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:25,705
As of today, I'm Kang Moyeon who's going
to be on duty at all times at the ER.

255
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,273
I look forward to working with you.

256
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:29,876
I've got Room 5.

257
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,477
I've also called the anesthesia
department and CS Nurses Station.

258
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,852
-Put him in surgery right now.
-Without a CT scan?

259
00:13:33,955 --> 00:13:35,548
We have the ones taken
from the first hospital.

260
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,860
This patient needs surgery
more than getting a CT scan.

261
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,752
-Okay. Nurse Choi.
-Yes.

262
00:13:41,943 --> 00:13:43,553
Then what about the VIP ward?

263
00:13:43,641 --> 00:13:45,425
I got fired, of course.

264
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:47,226
What about the broadcast?

265
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:51,720
Not as of now. I will work very hard.

266
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:53,032
The Emergency Department?

267
00:13:53,394 --> 00:13:55,017
No, the broadcast.

268
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,705
There's a patient from a car accident.
He will arrive within 5 minutes.

269
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:00,916
What a strong welcome. Let's go.

270
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:03,109
The location is good and he's healthy.

271
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,311
The due date is in two weeks, right?

272
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:08,414
Yes, we have 10 days left.

273
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:11,317
It must be nice to see each other
after a long separation, but

274
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,121
it would be best not to do "it"
at this current time, right?

275
00:14:18,028 --> 00:14:19,559
Why isn't there an answer?

276
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:23,529
-Yes.
-Yes.

277
00:14:29,836 --> 00:14:31,454
Dr. Kang, over here.

278
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:37,410
You are working hard to show
off that you are working.

279
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,319
It's nice to see you. How have you been?

280
00:14:39,415 --> 00:14:42,815
You went to volunteer and
ended up dating someone.

281
00:14:42,947 --> 00:14:44,339
I heard that you were dating a soldier.

282
00:14:44,434 --> 00:14:46,319
You didn't go into the
wrong operating room

283
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:48,321
and operate on the wrong
patient while I was gone?

284
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:49,823
You're really funny.

285
00:14:49,926 --> 00:14:52,141
It hasn't even been that long since
the scandal with the Chairman.

286
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,043
You go to volunteer and
meet a man so quickly.

287
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:57,613
Is that really why you got
fired from the VIP ward?

288
00:14:58,598 --> 00:14:59,699
Dr. Kim,

289
00:15:00,331 --> 00:15:02,068
for the past one month,

290
00:15:02,232 --> 00:15:04,937
I realized a few things
while volunteering.

291
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:07,140
We are all happy.

292
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,888
You be happy, too.

293
00:15:08,984 --> 00:15:11,077
Improve your skills while being happy too.

294
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,181
Stop acting superior.

295
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:18,084
All you did was give a few
vaccinations and take some pictures.

296
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:20,386
How dare you pretend to be Schweitzer?

297
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,361
What's with everyone?

298
00:15:31,595 --> 00:15:33,802
I know what everyone is thinking.

299
00:15:33,913 --> 00:15:37,580
That was the saddest moment of my life.

300
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,846
What was I doing with my hands
instead of pulling her hair out?

301
00:15:40,942 --> 00:15:44,545
Exactly. I had 2 hands doing nothing.

302
00:15:44,624 --> 00:15:47,224
I should have at least
thrown the tray over.

303
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:50,650
Isn't it okay to be on the
wild side at a time like this?

304
00:15:52,737 --> 00:15:54,554
Food tray?

305
00:15:57,657 --> 00:15:59,859
What's with Kim Eunji?

306
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:03,496
-She's so immature.
-That's all her luck.

307
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:10,486
If I'm reborn, I want to be born like
her and be immature my whole life.

308
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,972
Then what about me? What
should I be reborn as?

309
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,545
You'll be reborn as a man I never meet.
Live your whole life not knowing me.

310
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:27,119
I deposited more money into the account.

311
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,323
I put more because of my bonus.
Subtract it from my balance.

312
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:31,941
Is there still a balance left?

313
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:33,626
Haven't you paid it all back already?

314
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:36,345
Next month is the last month.

315
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,932
Thanks to you, my youngest's sister
tuition has been resolved.

316
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,902
When will that girl ever graduate?

317
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:45,905
She's been sucking you dry.
She isn't looking for a job?

318
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:50,109
I'm saying this as a person who
contributed to her tuition...

319
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:53,112
Don't worry. We will
pay back your money.

320
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:54,514
Let's go back inside.

321
00:17:14,127 --> 00:17:15,434
What are you doing?

322
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:18,504
They are in the middle of "photo-shopping",
to commemorate going back to Korea.

323
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:21,229
They lack in discipline!

324
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,708
Are you talking to me?

325
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:24,810
No.

326
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,481
It hasn't been 10 minutes yet.

327
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,451
You come lay down, too.

328
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:34,854
It's been over 6 months since you saw your
wife. Is that how you're going to show up?

329
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:38,257
A married man's face in broad
day light isn't important.

330
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:40,259
Everything will be good
once the light is out.

331
00:17:41,783 --> 00:17:43,651
I wish for a daughter that
looks like her mother.

332
00:17:43,842 --> 00:17:46,437
I wish you the best for
your future family.

333
00:17:46,548 --> 00:17:48,734
It could be a daughter that
looks like her father.

334
00:17:49,952 --> 00:17:51,637
Come over here.

335
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:55,697
Ah, we will be leaving for
our last patrol duty.

336
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:57,977
-Salute.
-No, just stay here.

337
00:18:01,962 --> 00:18:04,677
I'll go instead. Just rest
so I can get some fresh air.

338
00:18:04,764 --> 00:18:06,462
It hasn't been 10 minutes yet.

339
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:07,987
The last 5 minutes...

340
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:10,475
I'll give it to you.

341
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:12,258
Tap it in lightly.

342
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:13,960
He can't.

343
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:16,963
Teach this guy.

344
00:18:18,767 --> 00:18:19,974
Work hard.

345
00:18:20,077 --> 00:18:22,068
-Work hard.
-Wishing for your safe return.

346
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,369
Take off your uniform,

347
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:34,380
and go into Myeongju's maternal
family's company and learn business.

348
00:18:34,821 --> 00:18:37,216
Think it over until you are dispatched.

349
00:18:37,912 --> 00:18:40,920
Decide by the time you
come back to Korea.

350
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:43,789
Whether you'll let go of her hand

351
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:47,593
or become a man worthy of that hand.

352
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:53,265
That's exactly the face when
you're thinking about me.

353
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:56,469
It's my usual face.

354
00:18:56,972 --> 00:18:58,771
I'm always thinking of you.

355
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:00,172
What?

356
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:02,041
That was kind of sweet.

357
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,244
You should be laying down.
Why are you out here?

358
00:19:05,552 --> 00:19:07,647
It's boring in the patient ward.

359
00:19:10,216 --> 00:19:13,519
Don't stand there. Sit down.

360
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:18,491
Am I not totally lightweight?

361
00:19:19,082 --> 00:19:20,995
I've lost weight after
being sick for a few days.

362
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:24,697
-My waist is tiny. Take a look.
-You're going to get in trouble.

363
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,298
Put your hands right here.

364
00:19:30,191 --> 00:19:33,172
Like you will open your present.
All you know is how to talk.

365
00:19:34,595 --> 00:19:38,577
-Move. Your face isn't that pretty.
-If I move, you'll be blinded.

366
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,402
If someone saw, they would
think you loved me a lot.

367
00:19:42,892 --> 00:19:44,417
I love you, Yoon Myeongju.

368
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:51,490
By any chance, are we...

369
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:54,193
...breaking up?

370
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,397
Are we really breaking up?

371
00:20:00,592 --> 00:20:01,701
I love you.

372
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:04,603
I love you very much,

373
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:07,428
and I will love you
for a very long time.

374
00:20:08,608 --> 00:20:10,531
You kept on breaking up with me because
you loved me though.

375
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:14,513
We're not breaking up.

376
00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:16,816
From now on, I'll make sure we won't.

377
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:24,523
Move over.

378
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:26,625
You are making me dazzled.

379
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:43,209
"Mine Field.
Do not enter!"

380
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:32,825
"Special Operations Headquarters"

381
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:37,997
I, Captain Yoo Shijin,
and the other four have...

382
00:21:38,292 --> 00:21:40,824
...completed the dispatch
duty for Urk Taebaek unit.

383
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,781
I received an order to return to the
special forces and to the Alpha Team.

384
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:45,304
I report this to you, Sir.

385
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:49,108
Salute to the deputy commander!

386
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,676
Salute!

387
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:51,811
Standby.

388
00:21:54,497 --> 00:21:55,610
You all worked really hard.

389
00:21:55,677 --> 00:21:56,982
The Chief Commander is
currently directing the...

390
00:21:57,087 --> 00:21:59,084
...situation for White
Tiger's battalion training.

391
00:21:59,196 --> 00:22:01,476
I will send you the
message from the chief now.

392
00:22:01,587 --> 00:22:03,396
During your vacation time
for 4 days and 3 nights,

393
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:06,383
the Alpha Team will be taking
emergency outing operation.

394
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:10,798
As of now, get out of the base as
soon as possible. You got that?

395
00:22:10,877 --> 00:22:12,364
Yes, Sir!

396
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:21,373
"Discharge Application Form"

397
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:38,824
"Name: Seo Daeyeong"

398
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:43,429
16 hours and 43 minutes.

399
00:22:45,242 --> 00:22:47,967
It's exactly 72 hours from now.

400
00:22:48,552 --> 00:22:49,969
I have no objection.

401
00:22:50,172 --> 00:22:52,271
Just don't run away in the middle of it.

402
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:54,428
-No nights.
-3 days.

403
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:07,486
-Are you alright, Sir?
-I feel just fine.

404
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:09,555
I will go get some more booze.

405
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:10,756
Sure, go ahead.

406
00:23:13,633 --> 00:23:15,331
This cellphone is a bit strange.

407
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:18,898
None of them answered my phone calls.

408
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:22,674
The person that shouldn't
have answered did though.

409
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:24,069
Did you have a fight with your wife?

410
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:25,671
Yes, Sir.

411
00:23:26,792 --> 00:23:28,963
I almost got my ass beaten,
after turning the light off.

412
00:23:30,912 --> 00:23:34,647
How could nobody answer my call?

413
00:23:35,238 --> 00:23:37,940
One person answered and now he's here.

414
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:41,553
This is my first time since
I got this cellphone.

415
00:23:41,939 --> 00:23:44,556
It sounds like a different
guy being drunk here.

416
00:23:55,452 --> 00:23:57,169
What is this mess?

417
00:23:57,536 --> 00:23:59,024
When did these men get here?

418
00:23:59,127 --> 00:24:00,429
Why did you get here so late?

419
00:24:00,631 --> 00:24:02,441
It's because the night shift
barely ended just now.

420
00:24:03,256 --> 00:24:06,144
Are these men usually like this?

421
00:24:08,744 --> 00:24:10,855
Why does our reunion have
to look like this for?

422
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,363
I was going to make a welcome placard with
hearts drawn on it and go to the airport.

423
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:14,853
I bought some clothes, and I even
put a facial mask on my face.

424
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:17,138
The kimchi stew here is really good.

425
00:24:17,249 --> 00:24:18,424
Why don't you have a bowl?

426
00:24:18,532 --> 00:24:20,626
-Where are you going?
-I am going back to the unit.

427
00:24:20,722 --> 00:24:21,960
I am not on break.

428
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:23,765
Why are you leaving by yourself?
Take Sergeant Seo with you.

429
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,030
-Salute.
-Alright.

430
00:24:27,189 --> 00:24:30,104
It's 3 days and no nights of drinking,
so I can't take him with me.

431
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,805
No nights and how many days now?

432
00:24:33,532 --> 00:24:37,042
-They must be crazy!
-The girl that just came in is so pretty.

433
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:41,447
-The girl that just left is way prettier.
-No way.

434
00:24:42,384 --> 00:24:45,202
This woman is so much
prettier, you know.

435
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:46,785
See?

436
00:24:47,286 --> 00:24:48,884
But she is constantly staring at me.

437
00:24:48,971 --> 00:24:50,189
Don't look at her.

438
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:53,659
We would be at a disadvantage if we
started a quarrel with a civilian.

439
00:25:02,953 --> 00:25:04,636
Win! Win!

440
00:25:04,732 --> 00:25:07,973
Congratulatory drinks!

441
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:20,452
Hey, get up.

442
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:24,857
We are going to keep that promise
of 3 days and no nights of drinking!

443
00:25:27,162 --> 00:25:29,962
What are you talking about?
I am not asleep!

444
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:35,467
Are you asleep?

445
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:37,858
I am not sleeping.

446
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:42,408
Two more bottles of soju, please.

447
00:25:43,713 --> 00:25:45,110
Soju...

448
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,613
...please...

449
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:49,915
Here are your two bottles
of soju you ordered.

450
00:25:50,269 --> 00:25:51,784
Thank you, Ma'am.

451
00:25:52,785 --> 00:25:54,486
Why are you here, Dr. Song?

452
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:57,277
I know, right? Why the heck am I here?

453
00:25:57,388 --> 00:25:59,558
What are you eating,
instead of drinking?

454
00:26:00,042 --> 00:26:02,971
Almonds. I am trying to
recharge my stamina right now.

455
00:26:03,043 --> 00:26:05,364
It's so hard to keep
up with these dudes.

456
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,066
You should try some.

457
00:26:07,167 --> 00:26:09,792
I will take some. You are getting
so old for crying out loud.

458
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:14,273
The woman that we saw
yesterday is here again.

459
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:19,378
She practically lives here.

460
00:26:20,562 --> 00:26:23,949
I am gonna try to get myself
to talk to her today.

461
00:26:25,451 --> 00:26:26,351
Excuse me.

462
00:26:26,852 --> 00:26:28,153
You seem to be alive after all that.

463
00:26:28,242 --> 00:26:29,054
What?

464
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:32,761
-Do you know me?
-Of course she does.

465
00:26:32,858 --> 00:26:35,380
This lady here is your girlfriend.

466
00:26:35,461 --> 00:26:36,462
Seriously?

467
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:38,163
Wow, that's amazing.

468
00:26:38,564 --> 00:26:40,265
Are you my girlfriend?

469
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:41,366
Wow!

470
00:26:42,458 --> 00:26:43,959
Apparently, she is my girlfriend.

471
00:26:44,993 --> 00:26:46,612
Don't you think she is super pretty?

472
00:26:46,711 --> 00:26:48,807
What's going on here, Deputy Commander?

473
00:26:49,112 --> 00:26:50,375
You are not going to drink this, right?

474
00:27:03,772 --> 00:27:04,690
My goodness!

475
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:11,096
I remember this place! I remember it!

476
00:27:12,176 --> 00:27:14,666
I get it. I get it.

477
00:27:15,356 --> 00:27:16,768
Just takes these off.

478
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:20,839
No, it's okay. I don't like taking
off my shoes at someone else's home.

479
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,242
I get it,  just take off your shoes...

480
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:24,634
Are you trying to
seduce me or something?

481
00:27:24,737 --> 00:27:28,013
I am not the type of girl that would
eat ramen at another person's place.

482
00:27:28,114 --> 00:27:30,616
I get it. I will just
take off your shoes.

483
00:27:30,716 --> 00:27:31,917
I will just take off your shoes.
Hold on a second here.

484
00:27:35,254 --> 00:27:37,256
It's just Alzheimer's, she is not drunk.

485
00:27:37,642 --> 00:27:38,957
Chicken and beer?

486
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:42,033
Chicken and beer it is then!
I really like that idea.

487
00:27:42,136 --> 00:27:44,730
Let's go have another.

488
00:27:46,452 --> 00:27:49,401
Hurry up. What are you doing?
Let's hurry it up.

489
00:27:49,535 --> 00:27:51,336
Let's go have another.

490
00:27:53,065 --> 00:27:56,657
Let's hurry up and go have
another, okay? What are you doing?

491
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:00,045
What are you doing?

492
00:28:22,935 --> 00:28:24,336
-Mom?
-Mom?

493
00:28:25,742 --> 00:28:27,039
My mom's clothes,

494
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:29,241
my mom's handbag,

495
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:31,510
and my mom herself.

496
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:43,021
Who is this young man?

497
00:28:44,112 --> 00:28:45,224
Nice to you meet you.

498
00:28:45,624 --> 00:28:47,926
I am Dr. Kang's boyfriend.
My name is Yoo Shijin.

499
00:28:48,032 --> 00:28:49,528
You're my boyfriend?

500
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:51,029
Seriously?

501
00:28:52,412 --> 00:28:55,534
He said that he is my boyfriend.
He is so handsome, right, Mom?

502
00:28:55,831 --> 00:28:59,238
Why do you always go all the
way whenever you drink?

503
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,442
She is a real nice kid
for the most part,

504
00:29:03,634 --> 00:29:05,244
but her drinking habits is a bit..

505
00:29:05,346 --> 00:29:07,346
I am fine with it, Ma'am.
She is quite cute actually.

506
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:10,148
I am glad that you are so
understanding about it.

507
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:13,352
By the way, what do you do for a living?

508
00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:15,647
He's a soldier and he is a captain.

509
00:29:15,753 --> 00:29:17,756
However, more detailed
information is a secret.

510
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:20,959
Everything has to be a secret
for the sake of regulations.

511
00:29:21,454 --> 00:29:24,663
Oh, goosebumps.
What was this memory just now?

512
00:29:25,567 --> 00:29:29,468
Paycheck comes in on time but
doesn't come home very often.

513
00:29:29,558 --> 00:29:31,384
-That's nice.
-Mom!

514
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:34,053
Why do you have to be so brutally
honest when you just met him?

515
00:29:34,163 --> 00:29:35,874
I was talking about you, dear.

516
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:40,479
She practically lives at the hospital,
but her paycheck comes in on time.

517
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:45,984
But why are you standing
there like that?

518
00:29:46,462 --> 00:29:48,287
Did you make a mistake that
you deserve punishment for?

519
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,756
-No, I didn't.
-You didn't?

520
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:51,932
Why not?

521
00:29:52,027 --> 00:29:54,660
I am sorry. If you want, any time...

522
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:57,351
That wasn't what I meant.

523
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,932
You seem innocent, my Captain.

524
00:30:01,322 --> 00:30:04,839
My Moyeon also just studied.

525
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:07,529
She's never even had
a man hold her hand.

526
00:30:07,633 --> 00:30:11,109
Mom! Stop. It's going to
put me at a disadvantage.

527
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:14,711
He knows about Yoongi and the Chairman.

528
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:17,716
Oh! I just got chills. What is this now?

529
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,209
Why am I remembering that?

530
00:30:19,418 --> 00:30:21,219
I think she needs to go to sleep.

531
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:24,392
-I'll be leaving now.
-No, it is okay. I should leave.

532
00:30:24,502 --> 00:30:27,993
-I am not old fashioned like that.
-No. I am old fashioned. I will leave.

533
00:30:28,642 --> 00:30:30,730
I will greet you officially next time.

534
00:30:30,843 --> 00:30:32,130
Okay then.

535
00:30:48,462 --> 00:30:50,949
I will be 10 minutes late.
Please order first for me.

536
00:30:51,042 --> 00:30:52,351
Club sandwich for me.

537
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:54,453
A lot of jalapenos and
take out the onions.

538
00:30:54,542 --> 00:30:57,552
Plenty of hot chili sauce and I
want toasted white bread please.

539
00:30:57,656 --> 00:30:58,657
Like this.

540
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:02,661
2 club sandwiches, right?

541
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:05,063
I will help you with the payment.

542
00:31:05,464 --> 00:31:06,565
Please pay it with this.

543
00:31:06,765 --> 00:31:08,066
Yes.

544
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:14,806
Did you get sober?

545
00:31:14,952 --> 00:31:18,143
Of course. I didn't drink a lot.

546
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:21,738
I think you drank a lot. You became a
different person because you were drunk.

547
00:31:21,832 --> 00:31:25,917
That was me. I remember everything.

548
00:31:26,318 --> 00:31:27,919
I can't believe it.

549
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,792
What did your mom say?

550
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,528
Does she like me?

551
00:31:37,302 --> 00:31:38,830
You met my mother?

552
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:39,931
When?

553
00:31:40,414 --> 00:31:42,000
You said you remember everything...

554
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:48,140
-Try drinking with another punk...
-Oh, jealousy.

555
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:53,345
-I guess you aren't sober yet.
-Oh! You're so smart!

556
00:31:54,472 --> 00:31:56,081
Phone. Phone.

557
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:03,989
Salute. This is

558
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:05,290
Captain Yoo Shijin.

559
00:32:06,158 --> 00:32:07,292
Yes, I understand.

560
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:14,099
Yes, I understand.

561
00:32:14,566 --> 00:32:15,367
Yes.

562
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:16,568
Salute.

563
00:32:22,782 --> 00:32:24,042
I have to...

564
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:26,578
...go to the department store.

565
00:32:29,037 --> 00:32:30,115
Oh.

566
00:32:30,232 --> 00:32:31,238
I am sorry.

567
00:32:37,112 --> 00:32:38,030
No.

568
00:32:40,611 --> 00:32:42,527
Watch a movie with me
after you come back.

569
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:44,529
Do you agree or not?

570
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,601
I like it.

571
00:32:51,603 --> 00:32:52,904
Come back safely.

572
00:32:53,672 --> 00:32:54,806
Thank you.

573
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:07,485
"Restricted Area"

574
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:12,791
"NIS"

575
00:33:16,982 --> 00:33:20,210
Since you used to do bad thing when
you were young, black suits you well.

576
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:22,000
My skin complexion is kind of fair.

577
00:33:22,701 --> 00:33:26,004
I saw your fair skin complexion well.

578
00:33:30,275 --> 00:33:33,478
It's a minute before the briefing.
Stop joking around.

579
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:34,679
Salute.

580
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,483
What brought you here?

581
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,882
Were you dispatched on
an administrative task?

582
00:33:40,997 --> 00:33:43,088
I'm sure I didn't come
to greet you both.

583
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:45,690
This 1029 plan,

584
00:33:47,468 --> 00:33:48,970
I'm the presiding officer.

585
00:33:49,094 --> 00:33:52,019
Where's your discipline?
Get in there right away!

586
00:33:55,309 --> 00:33:59,253
Do your homework and check your guns.

587
00:33:59,522 --> 00:34:02,140
Set our communication channel to three.

588
00:34:04,784 --> 00:34:07,005
The manual for the ball
pen is the same as before.

589
00:34:07,072 --> 00:34:09,281
In case of emergency,
if you shoot near an artery,

590
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,383
it'll cause painless
death within 10 seconds.

591
00:34:15,754 --> 00:34:19,057
Goryeo Hotel, Pyeongyang.

592
00:34:19,183 --> 00:34:21,512
I gave you my greeting on behalf of Mr.
President.

593
00:34:21,596 --> 00:34:24,396
Welcome on behalf of our supreme leader.

594
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:29,990
Let's go.

595
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,882
How is the knife wound I gave you?

596
00:34:43,982 --> 00:34:45,483
I am sorry about that.

597
00:34:47,582 --> 00:34:49,087
We won't be able to go that easily.

598
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:53,959
We will need to at least beat up some
South Joseon special forces soldiers

599
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:56,061
before we return as
soldiers of the Republic.

600
00:35:08,237 --> 00:35:11,142
Were you appointed to the escort forces,
after losing against me?

601
00:35:11,343 --> 00:35:12,644
I am sorry.

602
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:15,347
You still have a way with words.

603
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,921
Do you want to go another
round with me in the Republic,

604
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:23,454
without that ball pen?

605
00:35:23,592 --> 00:35:26,124
I don't think you're asking me
to write a report together.

606
00:35:31,583 --> 00:35:34,599
I'm also not the type to let you get off
easily just because I'm not on home turf.

607
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,769
And you still have a lot of guts.

608
00:35:39,842 --> 00:35:43,133
You can think yourself lucky that we're
facing the same direction as a guest.

609
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:47,030
For us soldiers, looking
in the same direction...

610
00:35:47,123 --> 00:35:49,447
...is a truce and peace.

611
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:54,052
Then let me ask you for
a favor as a guest.

612
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,322
Can I get cold buckwheat
noodles for lunch?

613
00:35:57,722 --> 00:36:00,892
I really want to have some traditional
Pyeongyang cold buckwheat noodles.

614
00:36:07,365 --> 00:36:10,068
If you splash the vinegar on top evenly,

615
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:13,905
and mix in the mustard into the meat
broth, it will taste even better.

616
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:15,473
Thank you.

617
00:36:18,965 --> 00:36:20,088
I will eat well, thanks to you.

618
00:36:20,171 --> 00:36:21,279
Enjoy your food.

619
00:36:22,612 --> 00:36:25,784
But, there's something you need to know.

620
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:29,688
Don't believe the server's words.

621
00:36:30,319 --> 00:36:32,223
Putting the mustard
directly on the noodles,

622
00:36:32,319 --> 00:36:34,027
is the traditional Pyeongyang way.

623
00:36:38,463 --> 00:36:40,098
Thank you for the good information.

624
00:36:40,265 --> 00:36:43,668
At the next conference,
I will treat you in South.

625
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:48,173
There will be another team
going down to the south.

626
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,275
My break starts tomorrow.

627
00:36:54,858 --> 00:36:56,247
Then, my payment...

628
00:36:56,848 --> 00:36:58,550
...will be on the tab.

629
00:37:00,052 --> 00:37:02,554
Its okay. Just eat fully.

630
00:37:11,029 --> 00:37:12,931
The door will open.

631
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:25,777
How are you doing, Secretary Kang?

632
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:29,948
-Isn't it hard in the emergency room?
-No. I am very energetic.

633
00:37:31,256 --> 00:37:33,459
What about the flowers? Are
you sending it everyday?

634
00:37:33,549 --> 00:37:35,756
Every time we send it,
it is constantly refused.

635
00:37:35,856 --> 00:37:38,356
As a result, the secretary
office is very aromatic.

636
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:42,383
What about the information
about Doctor Kang's boyfriend?

637
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,494
Did you find it?

638
00:37:43,602 --> 00:37:45,296
It is a bit strange.

639
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:47,699
They didn't know anything
on the information.

640
00:37:47,788 --> 00:37:49,601
They only know that he's
in the special force.

641
00:37:49,812 --> 00:37:53,304
But I got a picture. Here you go.

642
00:37:53,999 --> 00:37:55,607
This...

643
00:37:56,362 --> 00:37:57,575
Who is he among them?

644
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:00,378
-I still haven't found out about it yet.
-What?

645
00:38:03,462 --> 00:38:06,985
Dr. Kang Moyeon's
boyfriend is this person.

646
00:38:07,102 --> 00:38:10,889
Born in 1980. His name, Yoo Shijin.
He's a captain in Korean army,

647
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:12,786
zodiac sign is Pisces, and blood type A.

648
00:38:12,891 --> 00:38:16,761
Oh this person.

649
00:38:16,972 --> 00:38:19,664
But this person is this person.

650
00:38:19,752 --> 00:38:21,366
Yes. Then...

651
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,460
Wait a minute.

652
00:38:29,584 --> 00:38:31,075
I want to talk to you for a bit.

653
00:38:32,902 --> 00:38:35,680
Then you two have a good time.

654
00:38:45,212 --> 00:38:47,826
So you are Dr. Kang's boy...

655
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:52,630
Is the injured area okay?

656
00:38:53,398 --> 00:38:56,100
I don't know if you actually are calm or
if you're just pretending to be calm.

657
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:59,604
If the reason Dr. Kang rejected
me was because of you,

658
00:38:59,689 --> 00:39:01,806
it hurts my pride very much.

659
00:39:03,272 --> 00:39:05,476
Anyways, you're a special
forces captain aren't you?

660
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,379
Do you fight well?

661
00:39:10,971 --> 00:39:14,586
I heard you took her to the
hotel on the first date.

662
00:39:14,957 --> 00:39:16,354
My girlfriend.

663
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:21,659
In any case, please be careful.

664
00:39:22,048 --> 00:39:25,563
Keep your body and head safe.

665
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,267
I fight very well.

666
00:39:35,273 --> 00:39:36,374
Seriously.

667
00:39:37,082 --> 00:39:39,455
Kang Moyeon,
can you cover the night duty?

668
00:39:39,558 --> 00:39:40,558
I don't want to.

669
00:39:41,149 --> 00:39:43,554
I just want you to help cover the night
shift for me. Do you hate it that much?

670
00:39:43,641 --> 00:39:44,949
No, I don't like it.

671
00:39:45,648 --> 00:39:48,920
I'm not the Kang Moyeon who help
cover for you anymore, so just go.

672
00:39:48,987 --> 00:39:53,291
Hey, all the hospital night duties used
to be covered by you. What are you saying?

673
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:56,094
Yes, I know that I cover others'
night shift at the hospital,

674
00:39:56,194 --> 00:39:57,495
but I don't want to cover for you.

675
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:01,399
Are you already done with
the department store?

676
00:40:01,497 --> 00:40:04,002
I finished quickly to meet
you when you got off work.

677
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:06,882
It isn't time for the
department store to be done yet.

678
00:40:06,969 --> 00:40:09,683
It's a department store that you
can't even imagine. Don't interfere.

679
00:40:09,772 --> 00:40:12,841
I know department stores better than you.

680
00:40:12,995 --> 00:40:15,880
But who is this? Aren't you
going to introduce us?

681
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:18,491
You got paged. It seems very urgent.

682
00:40:18,586 --> 00:40:20,585
I didn't bring my cellphone.

683
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,323
I'm Kim Eunji.
I'm Doctor Kang's friend as well.

684
00:40:25,405 --> 00:40:26,791
friend as well. Nice to meet you.

685
00:40:27,672 --> 00:40:31,458
I'm Yoo Shijin. I'm Dr. Kang's
boyfriend. Pleased to meet you.

686
00:40:31,579 --> 00:40:33,081
Don't be too pleased.

687
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:37,769
So this is the soldier
boyfriend I heard rumors of.

688
00:40:38,336 --> 00:40:39,671
I'm off now!

689
00:40:40,157 --> 00:40:41,172
Then, I...

690
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:47,712
How annoying. How can a
soldier be so handsome?

691
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:51,015
Pleased to meet her? Please to meet you.

692
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,829
Why are you so pleased? What's there
to be pleased about? Are you crazy?

693
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:55,019
Are you talking about me?

694
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:56,220
No.

695
00:40:56,421 --> 00:40:58,222
That fox-like wench earlier.

696
00:40:59,242 --> 00:41:00,734
The timing is strange.

697
00:41:00,853 --> 00:41:03,559
Can't you tell by looking?
She was being too friendly.

698
00:41:03,635 --> 00:41:05,933
I was being so cold.

699
00:41:06,027 --> 00:41:08,297
But you're going to introduce yourself?
But wait...

700
00:41:08,408 --> 00:41:11,602
You're so detailed when you're in charge
of soldiers but why are you so clueless?

701
00:41:12,892 --> 00:41:15,406
Are you acting jealous right now?

702
00:41:16,612 --> 00:41:19,110
If you knew whom I just met,

703
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,708
-you wouldn't be like this with me.
-What? Who was it?

704
00:41:21,807 --> 00:41:23,715
-Did you meet with Chairman or something?
-Yes.

705
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:27,385
Did you get hurt anywhere?
I was really worried.

706
00:41:27,477 --> 00:41:28,588
You didn't eat, did you?

707
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:32,090
Why didn't you eat? Let's go.
I'll buy you dinner.

708
00:41:33,179 --> 00:41:34,892
The timing is strange.

709
00:41:35,183 --> 00:41:37,395
Oh my! Look at how
pretty the fountain is.

710
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:40,698
-Is it the rococo style?
-I said to stand still.

711
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:42,699
I said, let's talk about the Chairman?

712
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,602
Look at the lights!

713
00:41:45,203 --> 00:41:47,223
Stop talking and stand still.

714
00:41:47,335 --> 00:41:50,241
What do you have to judge? Oh
my, what are you doing now?

715
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,343
I roughly measured it with one hand,

716
00:41:52,419 --> 00:41:55,190
so I bought it about this size.
I think I was right.

717
00:41:57,138 --> 00:41:58,329
You see I bought you a gift.

718
00:41:58,416 --> 00:42:00,418
Did you just measure my neck?

719
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,020
-By strangling me?
-No.

720
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,891
My hand
just went very close to your neck.

721
00:42:08,393 --> 00:42:10,695
Sergeant Seo is waiting
for Lieutenant Yoon.

722
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:12,830
It's a bit weird to give
it when they're around.

723
00:42:18,787 --> 00:42:19,771
It's pretty.

724
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:23,641
It's usually "Do you like it?" first.

725
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:26,762
-Ah. Do you like it?
-Yes.

726
00:42:26,868 --> 00:42:28,346
Isn't it very pretty?

727
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:30,848
A whole lot.

728
00:42:31,149 --> 00:42:32,383
Let's go then.

729
00:42:34,725 --> 00:42:38,701
But I'm not someone who gets
over things so easily by gifts.

730
00:42:38,811 --> 00:42:41,125
I know. Even though your
lips started smiling.

731
00:42:41,232 --> 00:42:43,528
-It's true.
-I get it.

732
00:42:48,433 --> 00:42:50,134
It's been a long time
since you've been here.

733
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:53,838
But I guess you've
changed your girlfriend.

734
00:42:54,839 --> 00:42:57,642
You came with a wolf
and a rabbit last time.

735
00:42:57,842 --> 00:42:58,943
They're dolls.

736
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:00,845
Enjoy your food.

737
00:43:04,939 --> 00:43:06,717
This is my real girlfriend.

738
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:09,320
This is my comrade.

739
00:43:09,649 --> 00:43:11,244
-Comrade?
-Yes.

740
00:43:11,335 --> 00:43:13,424
We fought together in Urk and won.

741
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:18,830
Is it just the two of you here?

742
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:21,833
But when did you come here?

743
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:22,841
And what is this about dolls?

744
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:26,641
Your boyfriend was looking for his
cellphone that had your photos in it,

745
00:43:26,727 --> 00:43:29,433
and we almost died fighting
a 2 against 17 battle.

746
00:43:29,507 --> 00:43:31,809
It was the toughest battle of my life.

747
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:34,812
What picture of me are you talking
about? My pictures are probably deleted.

748
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,315
I never said it was
pictures of Myeongju.

749
00:43:37,395 --> 00:43:39,684
You said it was good but not honorable.

750
00:43:39,994 --> 00:43:43,391
Wait, was it the funeral in
front of Haesung Hospital?

751
00:43:43,531 --> 00:43:46,134
Oh, that fight I saw on CCTV?

752
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,159
Oh, now that I see it,

753
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,361
it was the day we first met.

754
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:52,997
Gosh, seriously!

755
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:56,009
There aren't any pictures of me.

756
00:43:56,104 --> 00:43:58,002
How can you delete everything?

757
00:43:58,086 --> 00:43:58,887
And also,

758
00:43:59,571 --> 00:44:01,106
what are these?

759
00:44:01,961 --> 00:44:04,276
Are you working part-time without
me knowing? In used cars?

760
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:06,573
Ah, what is this, seriously?

761
00:44:07,059 --> 00:44:09,347
You put me through all that to get this?

762
00:44:09,436 --> 00:44:11,160
To me, those are Myeongju's photos.

763
00:44:11,266 --> 00:44:13,050
Is my face yellow?

764
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:17,755
I didn't know how to date.

765
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:20,158
So whenever I meet Myeongju,
I always drank alcohol.

766
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:24,595
So I couldn't even take her home. And
I always sent her off in a taxi.

767
00:44:25,263 --> 00:44:27,298
These are the license
plates of those taxis.

768
00:44:28,366 --> 00:44:31,849
When we broke up, I deleted all
of the pictures we took together.

769
00:44:31,968 --> 00:44:36,574
But I thought I could stand these
pictures since they weren't of Myeongju.

770
00:44:37,163 --> 00:44:38,365
So I kept them.

771
00:44:38,587 --> 00:44:41,812
Wow. Sergeant Seo, you're cool.

772
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:45,816
I think I just fell for you again.

773
00:44:48,408 --> 00:44:51,122
Is it just the two of you here?

774
00:44:51,923 --> 00:44:53,624
But Lieutenant Yoon,

775
00:44:53,741 --> 00:44:56,427
you know Sergeant Seo's passcode?

776
00:44:56,642 --> 00:44:58,129
I made it up for him.

777
00:44:58,218 --> 00:45:01,032
He thinks this is the only
pattern in the world.

778
00:45:02,934 --> 00:45:07,054
When you buy a cellphone, they
give you a little booklet.

779
00:45:07,157 --> 00:45:09,762
The cellphone instructions
are written in detail.

780
00:45:09,829 --> 00:45:13,344
It's okay. In my world,
that is the only pattern.

781
00:45:15,246 --> 00:45:17,815
-Let's go.
-Did we not leave yet?

782
00:45:22,014 --> 00:45:23,636
Be careful on your way.

783
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:27,992
Is it just the two of you here?

784
00:45:28,414 --> 00:45:29,894
Hurry up and go.

785
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,803
Were those photos that important?

786
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:41,806
So cute!

787
00:45:50,797 --> 00:45:53,217
But why are you going this direction?

788
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:57,822
Are you by chance taking
me home right now?

789
00:45:58,004 --> 00:46:01,907
When a grown man and woman are dating,
they aren't supposed to go home early.

790
00:46:02,026 --> 00:46:03,923
If a man have stayed abroad,
he should at least change a little.

791
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:06,130
How can you be so consistent?

792
00:46:06,721 --> 00:46:08,323
Maybe I really won't send you home.

793
00:46:08,433 --> 00:46:10,234
That's exactly what I mean.

794
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:13,838
It's noisy. Just answer your phone.

795
00:46:23,649 --> 00:46:24,649
Who is it?

796
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:27,752
-It's someone I don't know.
-It is someone you know.

797
00:46:27,852 --> 00:46:29,253
It isn't.

798
00:46:32,223 --> 00:46:33,945
Is it Yoongi who used to buy
you samgyetang?

799
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,349
It really isn't Yoongi.

800
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:40,951
And also, I think you're mistaken.
I bought the samgyetang myself...

801
00:46:46,499 --> 00:46:47,204
But...

802
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:51,509
...are you really using this function
just to take away my cellphone?

803
00:46:54,936 --> 00:46:56,937
Reporting in. This is
Sergeant Kim Beomrae.

804
00:46:57,012 --> 00:46:59,822
Sergeant Seo did nothing out of
the ordinary in the afternoon.

805
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:02,325
He fixed his hair with wax
three times before leaving.

806
00:47:02,433 --> 00:47:04,716
It wasn't three times,
it was only twice.

807
00:47:04,805 --> 00:47:06,598
Salute! Sergeant Kim Beomrae!

808
00:47:06,709 --> 00:47:08,797
I'm returning at 20:00.

809
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:12,096
Make ramen and be on standby.
I'll put you in instead of the noodles.

810
00:47:16,901 --> 00:47:20,104
It's just a habit.

811
00:47:21,105 --> 00:47:23,641
A person can't change overnight.

812
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:53,270
I'm not going to.

813
00:47:55,062 --> 00:47:55,873
Its a punishment.

814
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,861
You cooked the ramen well.

815
00:48:17,669 --> 00:48:19,363
But the noodles are flour.

816
00:48:20,453 --> 00:48:21,565
Ah, that...

817
00:48:22,055 --> 00:48:24,568
-Kim Beomrae.
-Sergeant Kim Beomrae.

818
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:29,640
Do you want to be on my sides
or do you want to become noodles?

819
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:34,406
Sergeant Seo returned at 20:00.

820
00:48:34,512 --> 00:48:36,614
At 21:00, he is good-looking.

821
00:48:36,762 --> 00:48:39,445
At 22:00, he remains
good-looking indeed,

822
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:42,357
and he'll be going to bed
while staying good-looking.

823
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:45,823
End of report.

824
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:50,194
Oh, right. Commander
is returning tomorrow.

825
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:51,495
Yes.

826
00:48:51,759 --> 00:48:53,764
Yes, I understand. Salute.

827
00:49:02,542 --> 00:49:03,741
I got a good deal.

828
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:11,248
Salute.

829
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:13,851
I came because I have a
request for you, Commander.

830
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:15,052
I've received the report.

831
00:49:16,053 --> 00:49:17,465
Let's have some tea. Have a seat.

832
00:49:17,587 --> 00:49:19,156
Thank you for asking.

833
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:21,358
But I'll do it another
day at another place.

834
00:49:24,562 --> 00:49:25,529
Okay, then.

835
00:49:26,831 --> 00:49:29,867
Can I take this as your decision?

836
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:34,839
-What is that?
-His dismissal documents.

837
00:49:39,225 --> 00:49:41,245
-Dad.
-Yes, it is.

838
00:49:41,781 --> 00:49:42,780
I will...

839
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:44,482
...take off my uniform.

840
00:49:47,284 --> 00:49:48,986
Did you have to do that?

841
00:49:49,636 --> 00:49:53,023
Did you have to make him take off his
uniform when I begged you like that?

842
00:49:54,171 --> 00:49:55,457
It seems like Lieutenant Yoon...

843
00:49:55,553 --> 00:49:57,862
...heard our conversation.

844
00:49:59,017 --> 00:50:00,925
When Lieutenant Yoon
was bedridden with the virus,

845
00:50:01,026 --> 00:50:03,234
she put her life on the promise
of letting you keep your job.

846
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:04,835
She requested that if she lived,

847
00:50:05,035 --> 00:50:06,537
I should let her date you.

848
00:50:07,143 --> 00:50:08,311
And to not discharge you.

849
00:50:08,441 --> 00:50:09,340
That...

850
00:50:10,241 --> 00:50:12,743
...was a promise between
Commander and Lieutenant Yoon.

851
00:50:13,143 --> 00:50:14,545
It does not matter to me.

852
00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:17,348
-Seo Daeyeong...
-My choice is Lieutenant Yoon.

853
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:20,951
If there is a price to pay for my
choice, then I will gladly pay for it.

854
00:50:21,742 --> 00:50:23,053
I will take off my uniform.

855
00:50:25,104 --> 00:50:26,323
With whose permission?

856
00:50:26,924 --> 00:50:28,025
Let's talk.

857
00:50:28,292 --> 00:50:29,126
Come out.

858
00:50:35,836 --> 00:50:37,434
My request is up to here.

859
00:50:40,638 --> 00:50:41,739
Salute.

860
00:50:56,229 --> 00:50:57,721
How can you do this to me?

861
00:50:58,322 --> 00:51:00,232
How can you let me know
about it this way? How?

862
00:51:00,323 --> 00:51:02,826
-I know how you feel...
-Don't pretend like you do.

863
00:51:03,527 --> 00:51:05,062
If you did know, you couldn't
have done this to me.

864
00:51:05,763 --> 00:51:07,682
I made the decision in order
to not break up with you.

865
00:51:07,765 --> 00:51:09,366
Do you think it was easy
for me make this decision?

866
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:11,669
It's not easy. I know.

867
00:51:12,629 --> 00:51:13,737
But what about me?

868
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:16,040
Do you think it was easy for me?

869
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,443
It was a promise I got after
threatening my dad with my life.

870
00:51:19,944 --> 00:51:21,681
Do you think it was easy for
me to be shameful like that?

871
00:51:21,789 --> 00:51:23,981
So why did you do that?!

872
00:51:26,684 --> 00:51:29,186
Because you kept running away.

873
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:33,691
Where were you when I was
fighting with my dad?

874
00:51:35,192 --> 00:51:36,493
Do I look like a fool?

875
00:51:37,895 --> 00:51:39,663
How could you, even without a word...

876
00:51:39,877 --> 00:51:43,767
-How could you not discuss this with me...
-I did. Countless times.

877
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:47,071
All my runaways equaled
a hundredth of words,

878
00:51:47,669 --> 00:51:51,875
Those torturing times when I couldn't
answer your phone was my discussion.

879
00:51:54,372 --> 00:51:56,547
but you ask the Commander to
make that kind of promise?

880
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:02,252
I guess we equally treated
each other like a fool.

881
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:05,322
How can you put them on the same level?

882
00:52:05,522 --> 00:52:07,215
At least I tried to make him understand...

883
00:52:07,318 --> 00:52:09,226
That's why I became embarrassed.

884
00:52:12,096 --> 00:52:14,498
I don't need an understanding,
but an acceptance.

885
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:18,302
Not because "my daughter wanted him,"
but because it's me.

886
00:52:18,722 --> 00:52:20,237
I hoped that Commander...

887
00:52:20,938 --> 00:52:23,240
...chose me because it's me.

888
00:52:26,479 --> 00:52:27,478
But...

889
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:31,583
If the Commander's permission...

890
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:35,185
...was a wish for his dying daughter,

891
00:52:39,612 --> 00:52:41,225
I won't start with you.

892
00:52:49,490 --> 00:52:50,267
Fine.

893
00:52:52,379 --> 00:52:53,704
Then, don't.

894
00:52:58,392 --> 00:52:59,810
Let's stop.

895
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:07,017
If you are going to be
miserable because of me,

896
00:53:09,431 --> 00:53:11,033
just become happy on your own.

897
00:53:12,025 --> 00:53:13,128
I'm being sincere.

898
00:53:21,098 --> 00:53:24,401
"Make the impossible, possible"

899
00:53:40,101 --> 00:53:42,920
Wow, we finally get to watch this movie.

900
00:53:43,919 --> 00:53:45,222
Even though it took a long time,

901
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:48,025
I'm happy to be back for the first time.

902
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:50,627
Even though it took a long time...

903
00:53:52,496 --> 00:53:54,588
Let's make sure we go back there again.

904
00:53:54,707 --> 00:53:55,699
That beach.

905
00:53:56,017 --> 00:53:57,801
Since we even took the stone with us.

906
00:53:58,992 --> 00:53:59,903
Sure.

907
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:01,625
Let's go back there.

908
00:54:02,617 --> 00:54:03,824
Two of us together.

909
00:54:06,722 --> 00:54:08,712
Who is it?

910
00:54:10,714 --> 00:54:12,116
Oh my...

911
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:13,817
Is there something wrong?

912
00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:17,321
I think I have to go.

913
00:54:18,222 --> 00:54:19,343
Right now?

914
00:54:19,441 --> 00:54:21,325
Yes. I'm sorry.

915
00:54:21,725 --> 00:54:22,860
Wow!

916
00:54:23,327 --> 00:54:25,329
Am I getting stood up right now?

917
00:54:25,622 --> 00:54:27,351
I'm really sorry. It's an emergency.

918
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:30,934
Let's watch this movie together later.
And leave right now together.

919
00:54:31,535 --> 00:54:32,336
No.

920
00:54:33,036 --> 00:54:35,038
I'll leave after watching this.
You can leave.

921
00:54:42,567 --> 00:54:45,270
That only worked on our first date.

922
00:54:45,372 --> 00:54:47,244
I paid for it, so we have
to watch it together.

923
00:54:47,363 --> 00:54:48,652
Hurry and get up.

924
00:54:50,754 --> 00:54:52,456
Oh, so close.

925
00:54:52,824 --> 00:54:54,124
I thought it would work.

926
00:54:55,822 --> 00:54:57,227
Can't watch this movie again.

927
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:05,343
On Thursday, at 13:00, you guys will be
close guarding the VIP of Blue House...

928
00:55:05,432 --> 00:55:08,539
for the second meeting between
South and North Korea at Seoul Hotel.

929
00:55:09,106 --> 00:55:15,112
From our unit, three teams of 707 Alpha,
Bravo and Charlie will join as a backup.

930
00:55:15,235 --> 00:55:18,328
You will be on guard at the
sniper point on level 17,

931
00:55:18,513 --> 00:55:20,450
and to guard the perimeter.

932
00:55:21,022 --> 00:55:25,511
The Alpha Team Captain will be
in charge during the rehearsal.

933
00:55:34,163 --> 00:55:35,353
I am telling this to the whole team.

934
00:55:35,455 --> 00:55:37,968
Rest for five minutes until the
rehearsal vehicle arrives.

935
00:55:38,482 --> 00:55:40,070
That's all. End of transmission.

936
00:55:47,544 --> 00:55:48,979
Are you eating it alone?

937
00:55:51,882 --> 00:55:53,584
It's too small for two people to eat.

938
00:55:53,784 --> 00:55:54,982
You only bought one?

939
00:55:55,071 --> 00:55:56,687
I bought two but I finished them.

940
00:55:56,791 --> 00:55:57,955
I need sweets.

941
00:55:58,190 --> 00:55:59,756
I think I got a depression.

942
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:03,083
What kind of depression
do you get so quickly?

943
00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:04,775
I broke up with Lieutenant Yoon.

944
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:07,898
What?

945
00:56:10,355 --> 00:56:11,535
Why?

946
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:14,037
-Who dumped whom?
-I got dumped.

947
00:56:14,438 --> 00:56:16,139
I cannot tell you the reason...

948
00:56:32,352 --> 00:56:33,672
An ambulance is coming in.

949
00:56:33,764 --> 00:56:34,558
Let's go.

950
00:56:45,602 --> 00:56:47,732
He's had 2 liters of saline during
transport and blood pressure is 80/50.

951
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:49,032
Its a gunshot wound.

952
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:50,240
A gunshot wound?

953
00:56:52,512 --> 00:56:54,811
We'll go right into surgery
after taking an x-ray.

954
00:56:58,382 --> 00:56:59,402
Please contact more doctors.

955
00:56:59,516 --> 00:57:01,807
I already received the call.
You take that patient.

956
00:57:04,256 --> 00:57:05,756
How's the patient?

957
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:59,142
"Descendants of The Sun"

958
00:57:59,832 --> 00:58:02,746
Even with your jokes,
I don't feel better.

959
00:58:03,547 --> 00:58:05,148
I'm so worried about you.

960
00:58:17,065 --> 00:58:18,762
Out of the worries you have right now,

961
00:58:19,663 --> 00:58:21,164
take out the ones about me.

962
00:58:24,714 --> 00:58:26,737
Please take good care of Captain Yoo.

963
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:30,007
Because I really like him so much.

964
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:32,542
I want to tell him that when he comes.
