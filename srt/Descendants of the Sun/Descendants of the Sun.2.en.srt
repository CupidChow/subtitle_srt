1
00:01:17,823 --> 00:01:20,204
"Episode 2"

2
00:01:20,982 --> 00:01:22,497
What are you doing here?

3
00:01:26,782 --> 00:01:28,939
Why? Is something there?

4
00:01:30,032 --> 00:01:30,980
Dr. Song,

5
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,685
if you're a special task soldier,

6
00:01:34,058 --> 00:01:35,835
does the helicopter come pick you up,

7
00:01:36,161 --> 00:01:37,955
and do you get shot by guns?

8
00:01:38,082 --> 00:01:41,097
Hey, why would a South Korean soldier
ever get shot by gun?

9
00:01:41,287 --> 00:01:43,457
They usually get rained or snowed on.

10
00:01:43,581 --> 00:01:46,295
And after that, they have to clean it up.

11
00:01:46,989 --> 00:01:47,978
It's usually like that, right?

12
00:01:50,136 --> 00:01:52,681
Then, who is the guy who just flew away?

13
00:01:53,186 --> 00:01:54,388
Someone flew away?

14
00:01:54,825 --> 00:01:56,665
Did he flee or did he fly?

15
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,472
Either way, he must've
been desperate to do that.

16
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:11,260
"Afghanistan-Pakistan Border
UN Peacekeeper Station"

17
00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:15,204
Two UN workers, active in Gandamak region,

18
00:02:15,332 --> 00:02:17,186
have been kidnapped by the Taliban.

19
00:02:17,474 --> 00:02:18,575
Next slide, please.

20
00:02:19,704 --> 00:02:21,894
This is the building
where the hostages are held.

21
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:24,093
One team will enter from the north-east.

22
00:02:24,217 --> 00:02:26,319
The other team will enter
from the south-east.

23
00:02:31,204 --> 00:02:32,816
Clear!

24
00:02:33,143 --> 00:02:35,658
You have 90 seconds to
complete this mission.

25
00:02:35,996 --> 00:02:38,775
From entering to rescuing the hostages.

26
00:02:39,363 --> 00:02:40,532
Is that clear?

27
00:02:47,463 --> 00:02:48,391
No!

28
00:03:03,546 --> 00:03:04,569
Operation fail.

29
00:03:05,005 --> 00:03:06,078
Our troops are all dead.

30
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:09,090
It's a dual booty trap.
Pull yourself together!

31
00:03:09,198 --> 00:03:10,198
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:13,786 --> 00:03:15,452
Hey man, what's going on?

33
00:03:15,635 --> 00:03:18,086
How about you and your Korean boy scouts,

34
00:03:18,182 --> 00:03:21,039
go back home and train with your mamas?

35
00:03:25,447 --> 00:03:27,320
He's making me want to act out again.

36
00:03:42,546 --> 00:03:45,156
Get him off! Get him off!

37
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,299
Fight! Fight!

38
00:03:56,624 --> 00:03:57,668
Come on, man!

39
00:03:58,702 --> 00:03:59,633
You like that?

40
00:04:01,888 --> 00:04:04,616
Get up, man! Fight!

41
00:04:11,566 --> 00:04:13,519
Our Team Leader will die
if we don't stop them.

42
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:16,353
He can kill or get killed.

43
00:04:18,576 --> 00:04:21,262
When special task soldiers
of combined operations first met,

44
00:04:21,812 --> 00:04:24,654
they wager a fight
to identify each other's skills.

45
00:04:25,203 --> 00:04:26,671
To find out if the other person,

46
00:04:26,782 --> 00:04:29,497
is capable of having your back
in actual battles.

47
00:04:30,584 --> 00:04:32,816
This isn't sparring. It's a real match.

48
00:04:33,411 --> 00:04:35,391
It's not a fight for you to butt in.

49
00:04:47,811 --> 00:04:48,876
Get up, man!

50
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:23,034
Go!

51
00:05:25,157 --> 00:05:26,967
Delta Force Captain, Black Bull.

52
00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:28,339
Yes, sir!

53
00:05:28,548 --> 00:05:30,768
707 Captain, Big Boss!

54
00:05:30,903 --> 00:05:31,633
Yes, sir.

55
00:05:31,752 --> 00:05:34,116
Break time is over! Back to work now!

56
00:05:34,344 --> 00:05:35,814
Anyone got a problem?

57
00:05:38,486 --> 00:05:39,498
-No, sir!
-No, sir!

58
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,799
Back when I was the youngest applicant,

59
00:05:42,904 --> 00:05:44,394
I didn't know anything
so I wasn't nervous,

60
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,069
but this time it was nerve wrecking.

61
00:05:46,196 --> 00:05:48,248
I don't remember
what the questions were at all.

62
00:05:48,456 --> 00:05:49,289
What should I do?

63
00:05:49,396 --> 00:05:51,040
Forget it. You're going to get it anyway.

64
00:05:51,148 --> 00:05:52,370
Do you think you'll fail three times?

65
00:05:52,474 --> 00:05:53,357
Right?

66
00:05:54,107 --> 00:05:55,432
The Chief did say,

67
00:05:55,543 --> 00:05:58,363
I have the highest score
on the application screening.

68
00:06:05,658 --> 00:06:07,681
Kim Dam, are you going
on a blind date today?

69
00:06:08,257 --> 00:06:09,702
I had an interview.

70
00:06:10,051 --> 00:06:11,154
I was the third person after her.

71
00:06:12,051 --> 00:06:12,639
She interviewed?

72
00:06:13,036 --> 00:06:14,053
I didn't know either.

73
00:06:16,864 --> 00:06:18,091
Did your interview went well?

74
00:06:18,186 --> 00:06:19,521
He didn't ask that much, right?

75
00:06:20,231 --> 00:06:21,756
Was he like that to you?

76
00:06:22,603 --> 00:06:25,673
Maybe he thought
you wouldn't even understand the question.

77
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:28,953
Or there was no reason to ask questions.

78
00:06:29,558 --> 00:06:32,036
I'm leaving. I have a surgery.

79
00:06:35,497 --> 00:06:38,008
She interviewed
for the professor spot, right?

80
00:06:38,296 --> 00:06:40,119
She, who failed the specialist surgeon
exam three times?

81
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:41,344
It's four times.

82
00:06:42,273 --> 00:06:44,101
Are they trying to show
a better assortment or something?

83
00:06:47,626 --> 00:06:48,697
Let's start.

84
00:06:50,822 --> 00:06:52,720
You can't even
find the operation room now?

85
00:06:53,234 --> 00:06:55,916
-This is Professor Park's surgery...
-The Chief changed hand.

86
00:06:56,106 --> 00:06:58,160
I'm the head surgeon
instead of Professor Park,

87
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,738
and you are my assistant.

88
00:07:02,192 --> 00:07:03,027
What are you doing?

89
00:07:04,266 --> 00:07:05,412
Respiration rate is 16.

90
00:07:05,523 --> 00:07:07,146
There is no problem shown on the EKG.

91
00:07:07,262 --> 00:07:08,956
Let's start. Scalpel.

92
00:07:15,003 --> 00:07:17,848
I noticed that you put together
Chief Baek's thesis again this time.

93
00:07:18,026 --> 00:07:19,524
I noticed that
you bought him a watch again.

94
00:07:19,635 --> 00:07:20,661
Right angle.

95
00:07:22,632 --> 00:07:25,329
You try so hard at every conference
to get his attention.

96
00:07:26,096 --> 00:07:28,085
You should be the one getting
his attention for buying him a watch.

97
00:07:28,205 --> 00:07:30,179
I only got recognition for my talent.

98
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:37,131
What are you doing? What did you touch?

99
00:08:02,966 --> 00:08:05,664
It's a tension pneumothorax.
We need to do decompression.

100
00:08:05,811 --> 00:08:08,291
-14-gauge needle.
-I'm the surgeon in charge. I'll do it.

101
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:09,987
Then, hurry up and do it.

102
00:08:10,896 --> 00:08:13,106
Give me a 14-gauge needle.

103
00:08:19,937 --> 00:08:20,664
What are you doing?

104
00:08:20,823 --> 00:08:22,349
28-F CTD!

105
00:08:22,481 --> 00:08:23,386
28-F...

106
00:08:43,451 --> 00:08:45,217
Get down. Get down!

107
00:09:38,255 --> 00:09:39,435
20 joules charge.

108
00:09:39,652 --> 00:09:41,793
Charge, clear. Shoot.

109
00:09:54,335 --> 00:09:55,457
30 joules charge.

110
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:57,267
Charge, shoot.

111
00:11:11,051 --> 00:11:13,931
Mission complete. Hostages are safe.

112
00:11:21,221 --> 00:11:23,828
Blood pressure and pulse
are back to normal.

113
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,251
Thankfully, we've handled
the complications.

114
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:27,845
You, finish up.

115
00:11:29,844 --> 00:11:30,854
I will.

116
00:11:32,506 --> 00:11:34,157
"In operation"

117
00:11:35,686 --> 00:11:37,370
If your hands are slow, practice!

118
00:11:37,482 --> 00:11:39,299
If your head is dull, know your place!

119
00:11:39,441 --> 00:11:41,606
Why is she being so greedy
for something she doesn't deserve?

120
00:11:45,051 --> 00:11:47,033
It was really nerve wrecking back there.

121
00:11:48,225 --> 00:11:50,445
You've worked really hard today.

122
00:11:51,116 --> 00:11:52,004
You too.

123
00:11:58,682 --> 00:12:00,257
You've worked hard too.

124
00:12:01,786 --> 00:12:03,746
But what happened to your mom?

125
00:12:03,884 --> 00:12:06,103
-Is she still a single mom?
-No.

126
00:12:08,108 --> 00:12:09,594
Ta-da!

127
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,158
Look at you being so happy.

128
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,675
My goodness.

129
00:12:18,456 --> 00:12:19,646
He proposed to you?

130
00:12:19,786 --> 00:12:22,544
Yes. We got couple rings first.

131
00:12:26,144 --> 00:12:27,185
Honey!

132
00:12:29,432 --> 00:12:30,321
Honey.

133
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,289
Did the surgery go well?

134
00:12:33,675 --> 00:12:35,339
Are you kidding me?

135
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:37,446
Dr. Kang.

136
00:12:37,617 --> 00:12:39,061
I heard you had something
to say to me in private.

137
00:12:39,162 --> 00:12:39,863
What?

138
00:12:42,693 --> 00:12:43,535
There is!

139
00:12:44,202 --> 00:12:45,241
Can you please excuse us?

140
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:46,709
What is it about?

141
00:12:47,132 --> 00:12:48,153
About a patient.

142
00:12:48,942 --> 00:12:52,489
About keeping patient information
private between doctors.

143
00:12:52,626 --> 00:12:53,699
Something like that.

144
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:55,267
Okay.

145
00:12:55,598 --> 00:12:56,868
Then, take care.

146
00:12:57,116 --> 00:12:59,505
-See you later, Honey.
-Bye, Honey. See you later.

147
00:13:05,491 --> 00:13:07,955
-What? What is it now?
-I lost my ring.

148
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:11,560
I definitely put it in my pocket
before morning surgery,

149
00:13:11,688 --> 00:13:12,878
but it's not there.

150
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:15,155
You're really pathetic, Lee Chihoon.

151
00:13:15,275 --> 00:13:17,215
It didn't go inside the patient's stomach
during surgery, right?

152
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,235
What? This crazy guy!

153
00:13:19,522 --> 00:13:20,419
I found it!

154
00:13:20,823 --> 00:13:22,779
It was inside the scrub pocket.

155
00:13:26,236 --> 00:13:27,084
Stand up.

156
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:29,352
Clench your jaw.

157
00:13:37,545 --> 00:13:39,990
But they were always stuck
in the hospital.

158
00:13:40,109 --> 00:13:41,299
When did they make a baby?

159
00:13:41,433 --> 00:13:43,228
The hospital is so big.

160
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,679
My gosh. That's racy.

161
00:13:46,807 --> 00:13:48,413
Open up.

162
00:13:55,045 --> 00:13:56,967
But what about that guy?
He didn't contact you?

163
00:13:57,656 --> 00:13:58,597
No.

164
00:14:00,672 --> 00:14:02,771
It seems like he's not a person
who calls frequently.

165
00:14:04,568 --> 00:14:06,194
What is his identity?

166
00:14:06,687 --> 00:14:09,117
Soldier, gun shot, helicopter...

167
00:14:10,173 --> 00:14:11,393
Is he a spy?

168
00:14:12,807 --> 00:14:13,914
Is he?

169
00:14:15,498 --> 00:14:16,629
What are you looking at?

170
00:14:18,046 --> 00:14:19,525
That guy's picture.

171
00:14:21,715 --> 00:14:23,874
I only have this picture of him.

172
00:14:26,276 --> 00:14:28,871
Gosh, you idiot.

173
00:14:38,624 --> 00:14:41,680
"Two UN workers
held hostage in Afghanistan are safe"

174
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:44,465
Have you eaten yet?
I'm still clenching my jaw.

175
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,504
Loosen them.

176
00:14:45,847 --> 00:14:49,064
It's my day off, so don't call or text me.

177
00:14:49,191 --> 00:14:50,056
I'm not going to answer them.

178
00:14:50,196 --> 00:14:51,383
Do you have something going on?

179
00:14:52,306 --> 00:14:54,083
Yes. A date.

180
00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:55,916
You're not going there
looking like that, right?

181
00:14:56,179 --> 00:14:57,718
You shouldn't!

182
00:15:18,478 --> 00:15:19,620
Have you been doing well?

183
00:15:22,876 --> 00:15:24,358
Why are you already here?

184
00:15:24,741 --> 00:15:27,257
There's two hours left until our date.

185
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,690
I'm not mistaken, right?

186
00:15:29,974 --> 00:15:31,526
I came really early.

187
00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:35,737
It's pretty nice to have someone
to wait for.

188
00:15:36,146 --> 00:15:38,918
How can you come two hours early?

189
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:44,687
But why are you avoiding my eyes?

190
00:15:44,802 --> 00:15:46,521
It's because my confidence
has disappeared.

191
00:15:47,056 --> 00:15:48,640
I have no makeup on right now.

192
00:15:49,316 --> 00:15:52,181
I was going home to wash my hair
and change my clothes.

193
00:15:53,862 --> 00:15:55,256
You're already beautiful.

194
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:56,783
Really?

195
00:15:58,017 --> 00:15:58,884
Why would that be?

196
00:15:59,671 --> 00:16:01,246
Is it because my inner being is beautiful?

197
00:16:02,246 --> 00:16:03,855
If you can tolerate it,
should I not wash up?

198
00:16:04,152 --> 00:16:05,773
Get in. I'll give you a ride.

199
00:16:06,756 --> 00:16:08,193
I guess it's not tolerable.

200
00:16:17,671 --> 00:16:19,551
Come in. My house is clean.

201
00:16:19,659 --> 00:16:21,047
I don't have time to dirty make it dirty.

202
00:16:25,181 --> 00:16:27,061
I'm just going to wash my hair
and come out.

203
00:16:29,106 --> 00:16:32,912
I'm really hungry
because I haven't eaten anything today.

204
00:16:33,102 --> 00:16:35,004
Can't we order food and eat together?

205
00:16:36,826 --> 00:16:38,619
I was going to buy you
more delicious food.

206
00:16:39,487 --> 00:16:40,944
Is it okay to eat delivery food?

207
00:16:41,116 --> 00:16:43,628
It's okay because the person
I'm about to eat with is amazing.

208
00:16:43,996 --> 00:16:46,749
The flyers are on the refrigerator.
Please order the food.

209
00:16:50,085 --> 00:16:52,616
-What do you like?
-Dolsot-bibimbap!

210
00:16:55,706 --> 00:16:56,942
She's very unique.

211
00:16:57,856 --> 00:16:58,991
She's also very pretty.

212
00:17:00,002 --> 00:17:01,605
Yes, street number 964.

213
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:03,009
Thank you.

214
00:17:13,435 --> 00:17:15,993
"Have the aircond repaired,
Food waste disposal is on Thursday"

"Renew car insurance,

216

"Emergency Water Cut Off"

217
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:46,918
What does it mean? Oh my God.

218
00:17:47,496 --> 00:17:50,013
Why? What do you expect to do?

219
00:17:51,213 --> 00:17:53,101
I haven't shampooed my hair yet.

220
00:17:55,256 --> 00:17:58,422
Gosh, it's refreshing.
Now I feel like I can live.

221
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:01,373
Did you order the food?

222
00:18:03,586 --> 00:18:04,644
Why are you looking at me like that?

223
00:18:04,931 --> 00:18:08,168
Did you wash your hair?

224
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,340
There's a water cut off at 4 PM.

225
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:26,720
That water must be cold, should I boil it?

226
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:27,833
Forget it!

227
00:18:39,527 --> 00:18:40,853
I'm asking you because I'm really curious.

228
00:18:40,964 --> 00:18:42,170
Don't be curious.

229
00:18:42,826 --> 00:18:43,940
You know what I'm going to ask?

230
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:46,781
Your face shows that you want to tease me.

231
00:18:47,422 --> 00:18:48,349
What?

232
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,481
My face is just a handsome face.

233
00:18:52,345 --> 00:18:53,740
What is it that you want to ask?

234
00:18:57,466 --> 00:18:58,597
Did you think about me?

235
00:18:59,937 --> 00:19:01,048
Of course, I did.

236
00:19:01,756 --> 00:19:02,983
How about you, Mr. Yoo Shijin?

237
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,887
Of course I did. A lot.

238
00:19:07,761 --> 00:19:08,840
Like a man.

239
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:16,793
Thank you for pretending not to know
about how I wash my hair.

240
00:19:17,645 --> 00:19:19,148
Let's drink coffee at the cinema.

241
00:19:19,482 --> 00:19:20,236
Let's do that.

242
00:19:23,188 --> 00:19:24,613
I should drink bottled water.

243
00:19:24,818 --> 00:19:25,632
Hey.

244
00:19:38,476 --> 00:19:39,905
When I come to the cinema,

245
00:19:39,998 --> 00:19:41,495
this moment is when I get most excited.

246
00:19:41,787 --> 00:19:43,398
Right before they turn off the lights.

247
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:49,053
This is the most excited moment
of my life.

248
00:19:49,294 --> 00:19:52,618
Being with a beautiful lady
right before the lights are turned off.

249
00:19:54,124 --> 00:19:55,386
Not an elderly?

250
00:19:56,736 --> 00:19:58,975
I mistaken you for a beautiful lady
because it's too dark to see.

251
00:20:06,076 --> 00:20:08,893
Earlier you said "hey" to me, right?

252
00:20:09,724 --> 00:20:10,686
Yes, so?

253
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,761
How old are you?

254
00:20:14,262 --> 00:20:15,950
You probably know my age from my chart.

255
00:20:16,237 --> 00:20:16,974
Earlier,

256
00:20:17,777 --> 00:20:21,403
you were the one who teased me first.

257
00:20:27,329 --> 00:20:28,696
I'm older than you.

258
00:20:30,036 --> 00:20:31,006
I was lying.

259
00:20:31,436 --> 00:20:32,396
I'm older than you.

260
00:20:32,496 --> 00:20:33,922
I don't think you are.

261
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:35,932
Show me your identification card.

262
00:20:37,106 --> 00:20:39,093
I was worried if you were a minor.

263
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:56,414
Salute.

264
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:58,930
This is Captain Yoo Shijin.

265
00:21:00,631 --> 00:21:01,655
Yes, that's correct.

266
00:21:03,756 --> 00:21:04,775
Yes, I understand.

267
00:21:05,612 --> 00:21:06,327
Salute.

268
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,680
Is something wrong?

269
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,465
I think I'll have to go.

270
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:13,481
Right now?

271
00:21:13,966 --> 00:21:14,704
Yes.

272
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,100
I'm sorry.

273
00:21:20,225 --> 00:21:22,337
Am I getting blown off again?

274
00:21:25,092 --> 00:21:26,622
I'm really sorry.

275
00:21:26,876 --> 00:21:28,681
Let's see this movie together later.

276
00:21:28,906 --> 00:21:29,844
Let's leave together.

277
00:21:29,976 --> 00:21:30,743
No.

278
00:21:30,852 --> 00:21:32,924
I'll just stay and watch this.
You should go.

279
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:37,137
-Don't do that and let's watch...
-It's okay. You can leave.

280
00:21:44,058 --> 00:21:45,135
I'll call you.

281
00:21:59,406 --> 00:22:00,885
Dr. Kang, it's me.

282
00:22:01,077 --> 00:22:03,145
I really tried hard not to call you.

283
00:22:04,268 --> 00:22:06,220
"Haesung Hospital"

284
00:22:14,426 --> 00:22:15,527
Did you tell her?

285
00:22:15,663 --> 00:22:17,028
How can I not?

286
00:22:17,745 --> 00:22:18,856
This time,

287
00:22:18,975 --> 00:22:21,522
Dr. Kang seemed to be getting
the position for sure this time.

288
00:22:21,664 --> 00:22:25,595
Kim Eunji seemed to be getting
the position for sure this time.

289
00:22:26,835 --> 00:22:28,352
But this time, not even a senior,

290
00:22:28,463 --> 00:22:29,747
but she got run over by a fellow.

291
00:22:31,181 --> 00:22:32,679
Kang Moyeon must be angry.

292
00:22:33,673 --> 00:22:36,578
Dr. Kang pretty much lived
in the operating room.

293
00:22:36,686 --> 00:22:38,396
That's why it's pitiful.

294
00:22:38,516 --> 00:22:39,921
She shouldn’t live in the operating room.

295
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,751
She should live in a greenhouse
like a flower.

296
00:22:41,926 --> 00:22:43,432
I heard that Kim Eunji’s family,

297
00:22:43,523 --> 00:22:45,182
is a big shareholder of Haesung Group.

298
00:22:45,317 --> 00:22:46,793
There's no way Kang Moyeon
can compare to that.

299
00:22:46,926 --> 00:22:48,485
How can that be?

300
00:22:48,936 --> 00:22:49,967
Doctors need skills.

301
00:22:50,087 --> 00:22:53,094
Who said that? Skills don't have skills.

302
00:22:53,231 --> 00:22:56,166
Wealth is a need for doctors.
Then, it's stamina.

303
00:22:56,266 --> 00:22:59,183
So, are you saying that
things turned out well?

304
00:22:59,832 --> 00:23:02,339
I'm just trying to point out what's wrong.

305
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:04,597
You said that it'll be me.

306
00:23:04,951 --> 00:23:07,245
You told me yourself that it'll be me.

307
00:23:08,529 --> 00:23:10,141
This is already my third time.

308
00:23:10,488 --> 00:23:12,607
The first time, you said I was too young
for the position.

309
00:23:12,739 --> 00:23:13,944
The second time,

310
00:23:14,131 --> 00:23:16,527
you said you needed to help the seniors
who helped you with your thesis.

311
00:23:16,675 --> 00:23:17,757
Look at this fellow!

312
00:23:18,393 --> 00:23:20,837
Did you think you had secured
a position with me?

313
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:25,646
If you say it like that,
I have nothing to say.

314
00:23:26,139 --> 00:23:28,659
I know that having connections is a skill.

315
00:23:29,028 --> 00:23:30,761
So, who will it be next time?

316
00:23:31,032 --> 00:23:33,480
The Minister's son-in-law?
Hospital owner's nephew?

317
00:23:34,294 --> 00:23:36,111
In at least one of those three tries,

318
00:23:36,304 --> 00:23:38,537
shouldn't true skills be considered?

319
00:23:39,364 --> 00:23:42,241
It seems like you don't need
a fourth chance, Dr. Kang.

320
00:23:42,383 --> 00:23:43,490
Sir!

321
00:23:46,954 --> 00:23:47,852
Professor Kim,

322
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:49,859
we've finished talking,

323
00:23:49,984 --> 00:23:52,610
so let Dr. Kang know about the broadcast,

324
00:23:52,724 --> 00:23:54,259
and come to Professor Park's office.

325
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:57,028
Let's go together with Doctor Park's car.

326
00:23:57,236 --> 00:23:59,092
Yes, I'll be right there.

327
00:23:59,561 --> 00:24:01,084
-Chief!
-Hey!

328
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:05,962
You have to fill me in
for my broadcast tomorrow.

329
00:24:06,088 --> 00:24:08,257
I have to eat dinner with the professors.

330
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:11,269
Are you telling me to be your substitute?

331
00:24:11,358 --> 00:24:12,305
Of course.

332
00:24:12,432 --> 00:24:14,726
You're supposed to do
what professors ask you to.

333
00:24:15,126 --> 00:24:17,408
Don't make mistakes because it's live.

334
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:19,254
Memorize everything and go.

335
00:24:19,603 --> 00:24:22,773
Our hospital spent a lot of money
on this PR.

336
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:26,459
What are you going to do
if I said that I won't do it?

337
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:29,010
Try to. We'll see what happens.

338
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:30,350
Why would I do it,

339
00:24:30,454 --> 00:24:32,232
when the dinner is tonight
and the broadcast is tomorrow?

340
00:24:32,334 --> 00:24:32,970
Hey,

341
00:24:33,382 --> 00:24:34,842
I'm drinking tonight.

342
00:24:35,215 --> 00:24:36,691
It's a celebratory drink for me,
becoming a professor

343
00:24:36,894 --> 00:24:38,818
How can I wake up early tomorrow?

344
00:24:40,085 --> 00:24:41,743
You are really horrible.

345
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,165
Aren't you ashamed?
Aren't you embarrassed?

346
00:24:44,792 --> 00:24:45,961
Well, I agree.

347
00:24:46,086 --> 00:24:48,578
I had to endure embarrassment,
but I ended up as a professor.

348
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:50,830
You got embarrassment but became nothing.

349
00:24:52,541 --> 00:24:53,720
Bad wretch.

350
00:24:54,256 --> 00:24:55,378
-What?
-You heard me.

351
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:56,915
I said that you're a bad wretch.

352
00:24:57,119 --> 00:24:59,497
I pity the patients
whose life is in your hands!

353
00:25:00,836 --> 00:25:02,406
-Stop messing around with me!
-Hey!

354
00:25:02,526 --> 00:25:04,226
You do feel embarrassed.

355
00:25:04,329 --> 00:25:06,049
That makes me even angrier!

356
00:25:06,224 --> 00:25:06,939
Darn it.

357
00:25:07,569 --> 00:25:10,568
-You! You really are!
-Let go!

358
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:12,560
-Let go! Hurry up and let go!
-You let go first!

359
00:25:12,676 --> 00:25:14,244
I'll do whatever I can,

360
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:15,855
to prevent you from becoming a professor!

361
00:25:15,974 --> 00:25:17,688
Are you crazy? Hurry up and let go!

362
00:25:17,806 --> 00:25:19,006
-You let go first!
-Let go!

363
00:25:19,137 --> 00:25:20,945
-You really!
-Hey!

364
00:25:21,831 --> 00:25:22,942
You let go first!

365
00:25:23,108 --> 00:25:24,220
Hey, hey!

366
00:25:24,821 --> 00:25:27,823
Why are you grabbing each other's hair
in the chief's room?

367
00:25:28,237 --> 00:25:29,839
Let go immediately!

368
00:25:33,486 --> 00:25:34,816
What am I doing right now?

369
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:37,113
I must be out of my mind.

370
00:25:43,325 --> 00:25:46,476
If a patient is suspected
to have arrhythmia,

371
00:25:54,747 --> 00:25:57,463
If a patient is suspected
to have arrhythmia,

372
00:25:58,116 --> 00:26:00,655
a 12-lead EKG should be...

373
00:26:01,318 --> 00:26:03,044
Why can't I memorize it?

374
00:26:09,757 --> 00:26:12,874
If a patient is suspected
to have arrhythmia...

375
00:26:25,433 --> 00:26:29,815
If a patient is suspected
to have arrhythmia, a 12-lead EKG...

376
00:26:33,566 --> 00:26:35,765
-You've worked hard.
-You've worked hard.

377
00:26:35,896 --> 00:26:37,800
Make sure you check all the equipment
before roll call.

378
00:26:37,925 --> 00:26:39,599
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

379
00:26:43,148 --> 00:26:43,945
Attention, unit!

380
00:26:44,064 --> 00:26:45,659
It's okay. At ease.

381
00:26:45,786 --> 00:26:46,961
At rest.

382
00:26:47,879 --> 00:26:50,381
You performed well,
substituting for Bravo Team.

383
00:26:52,553 --> 00:26:54,105
Did you get hurt anywhere?

384
00:26:54,576 --> 00:26:57,439
No. Everyone returned without injury.

385
00:26:58,181 --> 00:26:59,026
Thanks.

386
00:27:00,972 --> 00:27:02,599
It must have been tough for Alpha team,

387
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:05,011
having a lot of missions,
in and outside the country.

388
00:27:05,136 --> 00:27:06,803
Therefore, as the commander,

389
00:27:07,302 --> 00:27:09,222
I've decided to give
the eight month extended leave,

390
00:27:09,606 --> 00:27:11,468
to Alpha team.

391
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:17,710
Where will we be sent off to?

392
00:27:18,201 --> 00:27:19,626
Taebaek Unit, in Urk.

393
00:27:20,374 --> 00:27:22,976
You have two weeks
to go meet your girlfriends,

394
00:27:23,095 --> 00:27:24,378
and go back to your hometown.

395
00:27:28,256 --> 00:27:30,573
You may leave the base as soon as you can.

396
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:31,446
Dismissed.

397
00:27:32,896 --> 00:27:34,248
Salute.

398
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:40,893
But why are they giving us
an eight months holiday?

399
00:27:41,011 --> 00:27:42,131
We're being dispatched.

400
00:27:42,259 --> 00:27:43,745
Our "holiday" is us, getting dispatched.

401
00:27:43,916 --> 00:27:45,360
It's a regular unit,

402
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:47,471
so we can rest up, because there won't
be any emergency operation.

403
00:27:48,644 --> 00:27:49,987
Yes!

404
00:27:50,386 --> 00:27:51,797
Yes!

405
00:28:03,971 --> 00:28:06,110
Is Dr. Kang Moyeon in surgery?

406
00:28:07,141 --> 00:28:08,196
She's not answering her phone.

407
00:28:08,367 --> 00:28:11,427
Dr. Kang is over there.

408
00:28:11,613 --> 00:28:13,618
-Arrhythmia is divided into,
-She's doing a live broadcast.

409
00:28:13,829 --> 00:28:16,063
brachycardia, tachycardia
and atrial fibrillation.

410
00:28:16,175 --> 00:28:18,686
The incidence of it
increases as people age.

411
00:28:18,982 --> 00:28:21,005
Then, what kind of treatments,

412
00:28:21,125 --> 00:28:22,882
are available for patients
with arrhythmia?

413
00:28:23,002 --> 00:28:25,374
There's a new EPS test method being used,

414
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:28,987
for the treatment
and diagnosis of arrhythmia.

415
00:28:29,216 --> 00:28:30,882
The side effects can be minimized.

416
00:28:30,996 --> 00:28:31,779
I see.

417
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:33,731
This is your first time on TV.

418
00:28:33,843 --> 00:28:34,978
But how come you aren't nervous at all?

419
00:28:35,056 --> 00:28:37,090
Your explanations
are easy to understand as well.

420
00:28:37,566 --> 00:28:40,311
I'm really nervous,
but I guess it doesn't show.

421
00:29:17,657 --> 00:29:20,115
I'm sorry for that day.

422
00:29:21,863 --> 00:29:23,066
For leaving you alone like that.

423
00:29:25,166 --> 00:29:29,466
What I want to hear is not an apology
but an explanation.

424
00:29:31,286 --> 00:29:33,134
Where did you go this time?

425
00:29:34,284 --> 00:29:35,792
Did you ride the helicopter again?

426
00:29:37,083 --> 00:29:37,922
No.

427
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:39,740
I didn't go far.

428
00:29:42,417 --> 00:29:45,250
I can't say the details
because of the rules.

429
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,022
I see.

430
00:29:49,523 --> 00:29:50,870
You're not a spy, right?

431
00:29:58,758 --> 00:30:00,648
I had a long day,

432
00:30:02,123 --> 00:30:05,825
but I thought about you from time to time.

433
00:30:07,926 --> 00:30:10,967
I wondered, "Where did the man I got
attracted to go?",

434
00:30:11,807 --> 00:30:13,572
"What does he do?"

435
00:30:16,385 --> 00:30:19,013
But you can't tell me anything,

436
00:30:20,132 --> 00:30:22,643
even though we're meeting like this.

437
00:30:22,886 --> 00:30:23,929
Because of the rules.

438
00:30:28,137 --> 00:30:29,175
I'm sorry.

439
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:31,842
Special Force unit...

440
00:30:32,061 --> 00:30:33,235
Is it something like that?

441
00:30:33,686 --> 00:30:34,474
It's similar.

442
00:30:34,589 --> 00:30:37,217
You told me you shovel at your base.

443
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,566
The fact that you have a gunshot wound,

444
00:30:41,858 --> 00:30:43,632
means that you got shot.

445
00:30:44,454 --> 00:30:45,411
Then...

446
00:30:46,962 --> 00:30:49,004
...does that mean you also shoot guns?

447
00:30:50,811 --> 00:30:51,896
So,

448
00:30:53,706 --> 00:30:55,515
either you kill someone,

449
00:30:56,416 --> 00:30:58,114
or you get killed.

450
00:30:59,602 --> 00:31:02,685
That's the kind of work
you're doing, right?

451
00:31:07,444 --> 00:31:09,448
Do you only fight with the bad guys?

452
00:31:16,811 --> 00:31:19,695
I spend more than 12 hours
in the operating room everyday,

453
00:31:21,078 --> 00:31:23,480
trying to save people from dying.

454
00:31:24,823 --> 00:31:26,356
That's what I do.

455
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,720
Fighting to save lives.

456
00:31:30,516 --> 00:31:32,516
But your fights,

457
00:31:33,736 --> 00:31:38,055
are about saving lives
through deaths of others.

458
00:31:47,327 --> 00:31:48,680
I'm a soldier.

459
00:31:50,404 --> 00:31:53,905
A soldier acts according to commands.

460
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,234
Sometimes, what I believe is right,

461
00:32:03,032 --> 00:32:05,059
means something else for others.

462
00:32:07,512 --> 00:32:09,981
But I try my best to carry out my mission.

463
00:32:14,184 --> 00:32:15,236
Until now,

464
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,472
I lost three comrades
during military operations.

465
00:32:25,935 --> 00:32:27,927
The reason that we're doing this job is,

466
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,029
because this is something someone must do.

467
00:32:32,396 --> 00:32:35,713
Me and my family, you and your family,

468
00:32:36,947 --> 00:32:38,741
and important people
to those family members...

469
00:32:43,305 --> 00:32:44,814
I believe that my job,

470
00:32:46,077 --> 00:32:49,132
will keep the freedom and peace
of this land for those people.

471
00:32:54,664 --> 00:32:55,945
I'm a doctor.

472
00:32:57,435 --> 00:32:59,070
Life has dignity.

473
00:32:59,776 --> 00:33:02,784
I don't think there's anything
more important than life.

474
00:33:08,434 --> 00:33:09,397
I see.

475
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,479
I'm sorry,

476
00:33:19,895 --> 00:33:22,210
but this meeting was not as I expected.

477
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,876
I understand.

478
00:33:27,896 --> 00:33:29,154
I will get going.

479
00:33:29,855 --> 00:33:30,990
It was nice meeting you.

480
00:33:36,245 --> 00:33:37,084
Goodbye.

481
00:34:27,487 --> 00:34:28,997
Why are you here already?

482
00:34:29,081 --> 00:34:30,910
Then, why are you here?

483
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:33,505
Are you leaving without seeing Myeongju?

484
00:34:34,296 --> 00:34:35,296
You won't get to see her
for more than half a year,

485
00:34:35,415 --> 00:34:36,430
after we are dispatched.

486
00:34:37,888 --> 00:34:39,803
Did you meet the doctor?

487
00:34:41,059 --> 00:34:42,523
Please hand me the razor there.

488
00:34:49,217 --> 00:34:53,301
Staff Sergeant Gong said
there's a lot of beautiful women in Urk.

489
00:34:53,837 --> 00:34:55,436
The farmers look like Kim Taehee.

490
00:34:55,937 --> 00:34:57,715
The grape pickers look like Sistar.

491
00:35:05,162 --> 00:35:06,640
-A cool,
-A cool,

492
00:35:06,766 --> 00:35:08,561
-man!
-man!

493
00:35:10,934 --> 00:35:14,322
"Taebaek Unit, Urk"

494
00:35:28,808 --> 00:35:31,476
Left foot! Left foot!

495
00:35:31,609 --> 00:35:32,318
One.

496
00:35:32,656 --> 00:35:34,786
"Eight months later"

497
00:36:07,634 --> 00:36:08,908
Are you taking a nap?

498
00:36:09,613 --> 00:36:11,970
I was deeply reflecting upon the duty,

499
00:36:12,765 --> 00:36:14,509
of a soldier who has to preserve peace.

500
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:18,353
Would you like some iced coffee?

501
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:21,615
I like water.

502
00:36:23,968 --> 00:36:24,912
Piccolo transmitting.

503
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,825
We found a suspicious explosive
in zone B4.

504
00:36:26,959 --> 00:36:27,967
Suspicious explosive in zone B4.

505
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,642
It's a 82 millimeter,
high explosive ammunition.

506
00:36:30,775 --> 00:36:33,357
It's probably a Russian made dynamite,
used by North Urk during the war.

507
00:36:33,486 --> 00:36:35,398
It seems that the bomb fuses
are still alive.

508
00:36:35,525 --> 00:36:38,481
Its casualty radius is wide,
so we need to be careful.

509
00:36:41,386 --> 00:36:42,760
Basic procedure completed.

510
00:36:43,394 --> 00:36:44,396
What should we do?

511
00:36:44,893 --> 00:36:46,526
If we report to Lieutenant Colonel,

512
00:36:46,702 --> 00:36:47,981
he will say to never touch it,

513
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,946
but to ask for
US Army's cooperation first.

514
00:36:51,472 --> 00:36:52,982
Staff Sergeant Choi Woogeun,

515
00:36:53,718 --> 00:36:55,289
what is my creed for service?

516
00:36:57,233 --> 00:36:59,644
"Go easy and all will be well."

517
00:36:59,826 --> 00:37:01,986
We won't do any unnecessary work.

518
00:37:02,772 --> 00:37:04,476
Staff Sergeant Im Gwangnam,

519
00:37:05,391 --> 00:37:06,462
what is hard work?

520
00:37:06,596 --> 00:37:09,645
First, cooperation document.
Second, cooperation document.

521
00:37:09,756 --> 00:37:10,755
Third, cooperation document.

522
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:11,771
That is all.

523
00:37:13,176 --> 00:37:14,540
We will leave the US Army alone,

524
00:37:14,674 --> 00:37:15,659
because they have to preserve world peace.

525
00:37:15,805 --> 00:37:17,907
We will settle this and finish it off.

526
00:37:18,595 --> 00:37:21,665
As the on-scene commander,

527
00:37:22,833 --> 00:37:23,920
I will take full responsibility.

528
00:37:24,865 --> 00:37:25,510
"Taebaek Unit Headquarters"

529
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:28,205
Who is it? Which bastard is it?

530
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,870
Now that you are away
from the headquarters,

531
00:37:32,976 --> 00:37:35,854
the commands of your immediate superior
is like a passing dog bark.

532
00:37:35,966 --> 00:37:36,925
Only deal with the duds,

533
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:39,140
and let the US Army's EOD
deal with the live explosives?

534
00:37:39,251 --> 00:37:40,306
How many time do I have to remind you?

535
00:37:40,407 --> 00:37:41,152
Who is it?

536
00:37:42,083 --> 00:37:45,616
Which one of you got us into this mess?

537
00:37:47,211 --> 00:37:48,757
From what I remember, Sergeant Major Seo,

538
00:37:50,246 --> 00:37:51,495
did not stop me.

539
00:37:52,666 --> 00:37:56,076
Why didn't you stop me,
Sergeant Major Seo?

540
00:37:56,532 --> 00:37:59,345
You know that I really like
writing the cooperation document.

541
00:37:59,459 --> 00:38:00,292
How could you...

542
00:38:04,828 --> 00:38:07,010
I really thought that the cooperation
document was being written.

543
00:38:07,186 --> 00:38:07,987
Why?

544
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,312
Because...

545
00:38:10,686 --> 00:38:12,483
...he is good at writing.

546
00:38:13,112 --> 00:38:16,965
The Tolstoy of writing cooperation
documents, Sergeant Major Seo!

547
00:38:20,012 --> 00:38:21,028
You punks...

548
00:38:21,718 --> 00:38:23,154
Pack your soldier's gear!

549
00:38:32,031 --> 00:38:33,594
They came. They're here!

550
00:38:39,772 --> 00:38:41,312
Attention! Go!

551
00:38:41,514 --> 00:38:44,328
Good job you two!

552
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:47,644
-Work hard!
-Work hard!

553
00:38:57,256 --> 00:38:58,827
Still, isn't it better
to work it off with our body,

554
00:38:59,173 --> 00:39:01,181
than writing the report?

555
00:39:01,842 --> 00:39:03,970
Do you really want to work it off
with your body?

556
00:39:17,565 --> 00:39:20,330
She's looking pretty as always.

557
00:39:20,726 --> 00:39:22,517
Then, the best prevention would be,

558
00:39:22,621 --> 00:39:24,191
to get your body checked up regularly?

559
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:24,942
Yes.

560
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:25,706
"Kang Moyeon's Body Check"

561
00:39:25,829 --> 00:39:27,539
Among health check programs,

562
00:39:27,666 --> 00:39:30,010
there is something
called the carotid ultrasound.

563
00:39:41,646 --> 00:39:42,965
Chanjin Group's President Choi,

564
00:39:43,058 --> 00:39:44,741
had his first thin rice gruel today.

565
00:39:44,844 --> 00:39:46,042
He's in a great condition.

566
00:39:46,162 --> 00:39:48,420
Yuseong Electric's Madam
is being hospitalized again.

567
00:39:48,802 --> 00:39:49,724
Again?

568
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:51,675
Why? She was discharged yesterday.

569
00:39:51,801 --> 00:39:53,936
The actual wife barged into her house
and she was kicked out.

570
00:39:54,032 --> 00:39:54,865
My goodness.

571
00:39:55,486 --> 00:39:56,744
There are too many people,

572
00:39:56,873 --> 00:39:59,047
who can't discern
between a hospital and a hotel.

573
00:39:59,678 --> 00:40:02,368
Let's go to see our annoying VIPs.

574
00:40:02,489 --> 00:40:03,178
Okay.

575
00:40:03,319 --> 00:40:06,430
These days, my law firm
is handling this patent litigation.

576
00:40:06,533 --> 00:40:08,025
It's very stressful.

577
00:40:08,189 --> 00:40:10,077
Everywhere is broken.

578
00:40:10,776 --> 00:40:12,109
But among them,

579
00:40:14,323 --> 00:40:15,627
this is the most urgent.

580
00:40:16,093 --> 00:40:17,886
My new girlfriend...

581
00:40:18,032 --> 00:40:19,491
I don't know if it's because she's young,

582
00:40:19,786 --> 00:40:21,103
but it's very tiring.

583
00:40:21,236 --> 00:40:23,347
Then, you should meet an older girl.

584
00:40:23,817 --> 00:40:25,500
Do you think guys make money to do that?

585
00:40:27,086 --> 00:40:28,433
What about that thing last time?

586
00:40:28,696 --> 00:40:29,507
Yes, right.

587
00:40:31,976 --> 00:40:33,912
He is your biological grandson,
Mr. Chairman.

588
00:40:37,803 --> 00:40:38,975
Then...

589
00:40:40,474 --> 00:40:41,912
...please test for this one too.

590
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:44,823
Okay...

591
00:40:49,034 --> 00:40:53,558
I'd like to have turkey, ham, and seafood
club sandwich platter on the go.

592
00:40:53,724 --> 00:40:55,620
And chocolate chip cookie set too, please.

593
00:40:55,736 --> 00:40:57,327
Is there any vegetables
that you can't eat?

594
00:40:57,446 --> 00:40:58,525
Please put in all the vegetables.

595
00:40:58,655 --> 00:41:00,453
As for the bread, honey oat please.

596
00:41:00,723 --> 00:41:01,809
By the way,

597
00:41:01,922 --> 00:41:04,121
you are way prettier in real life
than on television.

598
00:41:04,969 --> 00:41:06,215
Should I heat the bread?

599
00:41:06,332 --> 00:41:08,040
Yes. Thank you.

600
00:41:10,632 --> 00:41:12,162
Who is this?

601
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:15,097
The one you usually can't see
in the general ward.

602
00:41:15,232 --> 00:41:17,968
Aren't you Professor Kang Moyeon?

603
00:41:19,682 --> 00:41:21,380
There's a lot to do because of me, right?

604
00:41:21,474 --> 00:41:22,594
A bribe.

605
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:24,963
I added olive to yours, Nurse Choi.

606
00:41:25,156 --> 00:41:26,443
Thank you.

607
00:41:28,049 --> 00:41:30,071
You never know
what's going to happen in life.

608
00:41:30,176 --> 00:41:31,335
You never get to shine,

609
00:41:31,454 --> 00:41:32,914
no matter how hard you tried
in the surgery room.

610
00:41:33,026 --> 00:41:34,485
Now that you've put down the knife
and picked up the mic,

611
00:41:34,604 --> 00:41:35,983
you've become the face
of Haesung Hospital,

612
00:41:36,081 --> 00:41:38,225
and the professor of the special ward.

613
00:41:38,371 --> 00:41:39,372
Ham for me.

614
00:41:40,019 --> 00:41:41,664
It's also very fascinating to me.

615
00:41:41,787 --> 00:41:45,461
My life could change again in an instant.

616
00:41:51,335 --> 00:41:52,378
By the way,

617
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:54,903
I went into the TV station's
bulletin board.

618
00:41:55,086 --> 00:41:58,601
They said you're just
as pretty as the host.

619
00:41:58,736 --> 00:41:59,855
Did you write that yourself?

620
00:42:00,321 --> 00:42:01,811
I didn't write that.

621
00:42:01,932 --> 00:42:03,392
You didn't write it,

622
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:05,384
but aren't you curious,
who wrote that comment?

623
00:42:05,504 --> 00:42:08,622
The nickname is Cuckoo Song.

624
00:42:09,578 --> 00:42:10,940
Cuckoo Song?

625
00:42:13,149 --> 00:42:14,674
Dr. Song!

626
00:42:15,348 --> 00:42:17,090
Did you really write that?

627
00:42:17,194 --> 00:42:18,781
My gosh.

628
00:42:18,893 --> 00:42:21,466
Please eat a lot, Dr. Song.

629
00:42:22,646 --> 00:42:24,162
Good for you.

630
00:42:24,297 --> 00:42:25,805
You don't even feel ashamed.

631
00:42:26,096 --> 00:42:28,312
How can you call yourself a doctor?

632
00:42:34,011 --> 00:42:36,005
-What are you looking at?
-I'm looking at you.

633
00:42:36,576 --> 00:42:37,942
You are not a doctor either.

634
00:42:38,098 --> 00:42:39,890
You're just your dad's daughter.

635
00:42:40,583 --> 00:42:41,205
Hey.

636
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,889
A doctor should be in the operating room.

637
00:42:44,009 --> 00:42:45,070
Not the makeup room.

638
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:47,362
We both are not in the surgery room.

639
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:48,275
Me, because I'm busy.

640
00:42:48,386 --> 00:42:49,395
You, because you don't have the skills.

641
00:42:49,486 --> 00:42:50,913
Don't be arrogant.

642
00:42:51,169 --> 00:42:52,205
You wouldn't be where you are,

643
00:42:52,315 --> 00:42:54,006
-if I didn't let you be my substitute.
-Enough already.

644
00:42:54,126 --> 00:42:55,784
You got fired
right after I substituted for you.

645
00:42:55,914 --> 00:42:57,697
You think you're all that?

646
00:42:57,823 --> 00:42:59,420
You feel like
the world is in your hand, right?

647
00:42:59,525 --> 00:43:02,205
Hey, how can I hold
this big world in my hand?

648
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:05,279
I just took back my title that you stole.

649
00:43:05,396 --> 00:43:08,388
So, don't mind about me and do your job.

650
00:43:09,474 --> 00:43:11,632
-I am leaving.
-Bye.

651
00:43:12,915 --> 00:43:14,153
Hey, hey.

652
00:43:15,557 --> 00:43:16,731
She's annoying.

653
00:43:33,917 --> 00:43:35,696
I'll come back healthily,

654
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:38,194
so let's watch a movie together.

655
00:43:39,694 --> 00:43:41,895
Hurry up, I don't have time.

656
00:43:42,712 --> 00:43:44,010
Yes or no?

657
00:43:46,496 --> 00:43:47,618
Did you think about me?

658
00:43:49,122 --> 00:43:50,321
Of course, I did.

659
00:43:50,615 --> 00:43:51,914
How about you, Mr. Yoo Shijin?

660
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:53,433
Of course, I did. A lot.

661
00:43:53,933 --> 00:43:54,940
Like a man.

662
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:00,688
This is our first date,
so we should set the mood.

663
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,799
I'm putting it here.

664
00:44:01,894 --> 00:44:03,577
Why not the middle?

665
00:44:04,671 --> 00:44:06,544
It's all about the backlit for girls.

666
00:44:06,679 --> 00:44:09,020
You have to put it here
so that I'll look prettier.

667
00:44:09,576 --> 00:44:10,805
Don't move.

668
00:44:10,976 --> 00:44:13,889
I placed it there
after calculating the angle of your gaze.

669
00:44:17,724 --> 00:44:20,225
But you got hurt again.

670
00:44:20,716 --> 00:44:22,847
Did you get hurt from shovelling again?

671
00:44:27,556 --> 00:44:29,259
How high do you think is the percentage,

672
00:44:29,355 --> 00:44:31,059
of getting hurt in the face
from shovelling?

673
00:44:31,866 --> 00:44:35,104
-Right? It's not from shovelling right?
-I did that hard thing.

674
00:44:43,616 --> 00:44:45,378
I guess you were very busy,

675
00:44:45,823 --> 00:44:47,156
to the extent that
you don't have time to wash your hair.

676
00:44:47,946 --> 00:44:49,839
Because I'm basically
living in the operation room.

677
00:44:51,409 --> 00:44:54,631
You know how sexy I was
in the operation room?

678
00:44:55,634 --> 00:44:57,150
Even only my eyes can be seen,

679
00:44:57,276 --> 00:44:59,364
I was very pretty.

680
00:45:01,677 --> 00:45:04,213
Gosh, I want to date that person.

681
00:45:04,791 --> 00:45:06,092
I guess she's not here today.

682
00:45:07,106 --> 00:45:08,267
Seriously!

683
00:45:20,011 --> 00:45:21,955
I don't have time to be sexy these days.

684
00:45:31,759 --> 00:45:32,648
What are you doing?

685
00:45:33,919 --> 00:45:34,942
Salute.

686
00:45:35,204 --> 00:45:36,743
Private Kim Gibeom.

687
00:45:37,196 --> 00:45:38,607
I am digging for the drainage.

688
00:45:38,713 --> 00:45:40,167
Do you think I asked
because I don't know that?

689
00:45:44,696 --> 00:45:45,339
Give it to me.

690
00:45:50,448 --> 00:45:51,456
If you hold it like this,

691
00:45:51,567 --> 00:45:53,263
you won't get it done
even if you do it all night.

692
00:45:53,464 --> 00:45:54,412
Watch me.

693
00:45:54,952 --> 00:45:56,040
Hold it like this.

694
00:45:56,167 --> 00:45:57,968
Use the strength
of your waist and shoulders.

695
00:45:58,201 --> 00:45:59,007
Like this.

696
00:46:03,714 --> 00:46:05,956
That's why I did it carefully.

697
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,722
You're bleeding!

698
00:46:09,036 --> 00:46:11,528
I really got hurt from shovelling.

699
00:46:11,666 --> 00:46:14,266
Please stay still.
I need to give you first aid.

700
00:46:17,309 --> 00:46:18,108
Hey,

701
00:46:19,208 --> 00:46:20,696
"I got hurt while shovelling"

702
00:46:20,822 --> 00:46:21,531
Attention.

703
00:46:23,172 --> 00:46:24,108
At ease.

704
00:46:25,121 --> 00:46:25,862
Attention.

705
00:46:26,827 --> 00:46:28,046
Is something wrong?

706
00:46:28,166 --> 00:46:29,946
Why did you bring this quack with us,

707
00:46:30,042 --> 00:46:32,341
-to this faraway land?
-I think he's cute.

708
00:46:33,161 --> 00:46:34,256
What should I bring back for you?

709
00:46:34,394 --> 00:46:36,565
I need wine and whipped cream.

710
00:46:36,674 --> 00:46:37,523
Because it's
Staff Sergeant Gong's birthday,

711
00:46:37,634 --> 00:46:38,849
he said he will cook us steak.

712
00:46:39,246 --> 00:46:40,857
He cooks very well.

713
00:46:42,047 --> 00:46:43,306
It is today, isn't it?

714
00:46:45,588 --> 00:46:47,384
Then I'll help you,

715
00:46:47,982 --> 00:46:49,575
in the wine operation.

716
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:58,479
I'm getting the whip cream ready.
Just wait a bit, baby.

717
00:46:58,618 --> 00:47:00,516
-Yes, no problem.
-Sure thing.

718
00:47:06,056 --> 00:47:08,728
-I come for this.
-She was saying it to me.

719
00:47:09,044 --> 00:47:10,695
Please don't misunderstand everytime.

720
00:47:16,721 --> 00:47:18,787
Did you get the one I asked for?

721
00:47:22,227 --> 00:47:24,129
Be careful with that.

722
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:28,769
It's pretty heavy. How do you shoot it?

723
00:47:35,854 --> 00:47:38,467
Are you scared? It works great.

724
00:47:47,018 --> 00:47:49,888
-Are you a Korean?
-Are all people who speak Korean, Korean?

725
00:47:52,846 --> 00:47:54,432
Give it to me!

726
00:47:56,119 --> 00:47:58,337
Gun isn't a puppy who knows its owner.

727
00:47:58,643 --> 00:48:00,667
A gun will fire
no matter where it's pointed.

728
00:48:06,013 --> 00:48:08,228
Why are you trying to buy a gun
you don't even know how to use?

729
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:10,151
I didn't buy it to kill someone.

730
00:48:11,748 --> 00:48:13,257
I bought it to protect myself.

731
00:48:16,478 --> 00:48:17,731
So arrogant.

732
00:48:22,494 --> 00:48:24,430
Should we just let her leave with it?

733
00:48:24,994 --> 00:48:26,758
You have the right to bear arms here.

734
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:28,847
Who was that?

735
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:30,815
Not a tourist?

736
00:48:31,891 --> 00:48:32,779
A new face?

737
00:48:32,898 --> 00:48:34,993
There are two things
which we don't sell here.

738
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:37,318
Women and information.

739
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,803
Here's your whipping cream.

740
00:48:40,392 --> 00:48:41,337
Urk?

741
00:48:42,139 --> 00:48:43,369
Where is that?

742
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:45,432
It's a country
located at the tip of Balkan Peninsula.

743
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:49,321
Haesung Group is building
an eco-friendly power station there.

744
00:48:49,488 --> 00:48:50,993
They called it volunteering,

745
00:48:51,155 --> 00:48:54,371
but I think those without money
and connections will end up going.

746
00:48:55,336 --> 00:48:56,663
I'm must be one of them.

747
00:48:56,878 --> 00:48:59,012
I have no money, no connection,
no luck, not even fortune.

748
00:48:59,124 --> 00:48:59,846
I'm speechless.

749
00:48:59,953 --> 00:49:01,048
You are affectionate.

750
00:49:01,449 --> 00:49:02,679
And you're quite good looking.

751
00:49:05,037 --> 00:49:06,631
Am I good looking?

752
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:10,412
I will definitely go to this volunteering.

753
00:49:10,595 --> 00:49:13,081
-I already got permission from Heeun.
-You!

754
00:49:13,459 --> 00:49:15,768
You're going when she is almost due?

755
00:49:15,872 --> 00:49:18,990
There's no way Dr. Jang
will let you go if she loves you.

756
00:49:19,154 --> 00:49:21,193
She said I won't have any more chance
after the baby is born,

757
00:49:21,376 --> 00:49:22,376
so she told me to go.

758
00:49:22,503 --> 00:49:23,399
My gosh.

759
00:49:23,536 --> 00:49:26,189
Why is this rich kid
playing Albert Schweitzer?

760
00:49:26,308 --> 00:49:28,547
Your life will be easier
if you live like Bill Gates.

761
00:49:28,671 --> 00:49:29,484
Professor Kang.

762
00:49:35,762 --> 00:49:37,290
Please leave your evening schedule open.

763
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:39,260
Have dinner with me.

764
00:49:45,918 --> 00:49:49,731
Did I just get a date request
from Chairman Lee?

765
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,862
-What should you do?
-I know, right? What should I do?

766
00:49:55,294 --> 00:49:57,569
What does rising star Kang Moyeon
need right now?

767
00:49:57,905 --> 00:50:00,205
-Fan club?
-An arranged marriage, you punk.

768
00:50:00,752 --> 00:50:02,620
Arranged marriage.

769
00:50:03,821 --> 00:50:05,390
That's not such a bad idea.

770
00:50:06,763 --> 00:50:10,118
I don't like the idea. He is a divorcee.

771
00:50:11,304 --> 00:50:14,436
-You're better than him.
-How is she better than him?

772
00:50:14,759 --> 00:50:16,431
Is she young? Is her family wealthy?

773
00:50:16,917 --> 00:50:18,901
As a woman with no appealing background,

774
00:50:19,028 --> 00:50:21,001
divorced man is a good thing
and not a flaw.

775
00:50:21,126 --> 00:50:21,949
Right?

776
00:50:23,156 --> 00:50:26,778
Should I upgrade my status
using this chance?

777
00:50:34,592 --> 00:50:35,801
What are you doing? Have a sit.

778
00:50:38,089 --> 00:50:40,399
Are we eating dinner here?

779
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:45,940
Do you think we came here
just to eat dinner?

780
00:50:46,531 --> 00:50:48,249
You said we're going to the sky lounge.

781
00:50:48,801 --> 00:50:49,733
There's the sky,

782
00:50:50,309 --> 00:50:51,226
and here's the lounge.

783
00:50:51,793 --> 00:50:54,018
It's all here. Do you need more?

784
00:50:57,257 --> 00:50:58,118
Manner maybe?

785
00:50:58,778 --> 00:51:01,919
Though I'm a fool to expect more...

786
00:51:02,608 --> 00:51:03,519
...but some romance?

787
00:51:04,719 --> 00:51:07,755
-Are you that kind of person?
-Then, are you this kind of person?

788
00:51:08,128 --> 00:51:10,499
I thought everyone knew
that I'm short-tempered.

789
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:12,437
We can order food.

790
00:51:12,549 --> 00:51:14,633
You want to wash first
while we wait for the food?

791
00:51:16,302 --> 00:51:17,405
Or should I wash first?

792
00:51:27,373 --> 00:51:28,983
You made the right decision. Come here.

793
00:51:36,332 --> 00:51:37,356
What are you doing, Professor Kang?

794
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:40,936
-Are you going to hit me?
-Yes.

795
00:51:42,963 --> 00:51:44,492
You hit Chairman Lee?

796
00:51:44,673 --> 00:51:46,182
I almost killed him.

797
00:51:48,002 --> 00:51:49,804
I won't get fired, right?

798
00:51:49,947 --> 00:51:51,502
I'm the face of this hospital.

799
00:51:51,613 --> 00:51:53,423
He's the chairman of this hospital.

800
00:51:53,534 --> 00:51:54,423
Right?

801
00:51:56,884 --> 00:52:00,064
I have a meeting. How do I face that guy?

802
00:52:01,353 --> 00:52:02,367
Glare at him.

803
00:52:02,479 --> 00:52:04,073
Glare like you're going to kill him.

804
00:52:04,189 --> 00:52:06,309
It hurts when people glare at you.

805
00:52:07,436 --> 00:52:09,882
What if he really starts liking me?

806
00:52:10,063 --> 00:52:11,740
That's my real concern.

807
00:52:11,953 --> 00:52:13,063
The next topic is...

808
00:52:13,151 --> 00:52:14,240
Darn it.

809
00:52:14,762 --> 00:52:16,896
...Urk volunteering project.

810
00:52:17,856 --> 00:52:20,619
I thought about receiving volunteers,

811
00:52:21,074 --> 00:52:23,257
but I want to send out the best doctor.

812
00:52:23,479 --> 00:52:25,928
Haesung Hospital's face,

813
00:52:26,346 --> 00:52:27,315
Kang Moyeon.

814
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:32,723
Professor Kang will be the leader
of the volunteer team.

815
00:52:33,194 --> 00:52:37,041
It's not like a hotel
but we are preparing a clean facility.

816
00:52:37,714 --> 00:52:39,222
You'll be the leader right,
Professor Kang?

817
00:52:48,356 --> 00:52:49,986
You never know
what's going to happen in life.

818
00:53:10,118 --> 00:53:11,730
Have you seen the name list
of the medical team?

819
00:53:13,488 --> 00:53:14,596
Yes. I saw it.

820
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:19,010
Isn't the team leader that doctor?

821
00:53:20,311 --> 00:53:21,205
Yes.

822
00:53:21,316 --> 00:53:23,268
Does the team leader
know that you're here?

823
00:53:23,436 --> 00:53:24,794
I don't think so.

824
00:53:25,747 --> 00:53:27,769
I guess it wasn't just a passing fate.

825
00:53:29,987 --> 00:53:32,160
It seems like the fate is colliding
while passing by.

826
00:53:35,141 --> 00:53:39,006
"Urk International Airport"

827
00:53:47,506 --> 00:53:49,205
Why did they bring me here?

828
00:53:49,689 --> 00:53:52,949
The UN said they have arranged
some soldiers to come for us.

829
00:53:53,066 --> 00:53:54,527
Let's wait a bit longer.

830
00:53:55,301 --> 00:53:56,534
We're waiting.

831
00:53:57,145 --> 00:54:00,444
We're waiting but this place is too hot.

832
00:54:02,502 --> 00:54:04,539
Life is full of surprises.

833
00:54:05,487 --> 00:54:06,714
It's an unknown number.

834
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:09,981
Hello.

835
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,417
Yes, who are you?

836
00:54:13,254 --> 00:54:14,080
Chairman Lee?

837
00:54:14,461 --> 00:54:15,586
Which Chairman Lee?

838
00:54:16,342 --> 00:54:17,493
Han what?

839
00:54:18,899 --> 00:54:20,546
Han Seokwon.

840
00:54:21,336 --> 00:54:23,972
Han Seokwon is Chairman Han, why are...

841
00:54:26,996 --> 00:54:28,725
Yes, Chairman Lee.

842
00:54:29,226 --> 00:54:31,301
My cellphone is old so...

843
00:54:33,766 --> 00:54:34,863
Yes!

844
00:54:35,183 --> 00:54:37,928
We just arrived at Urk Airport!

845
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:41,451
Yes, sir! I'll give the phone
to Team Leader Kang.

846
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:44,613
Why didn't you answer your phone?

847
00:54:52,550 --> 00:54:54,920
-This is Kang Moyeon.
-It's really hot, right?

848
00:54:55,197 --> 00:54:57,354
Just tell me if you've changed your mind.

849
00:54:57,978 --> 00:55:01,026
I have a lot of excuses to
bring you back to Korea.

850
00:55:02,386 --> 00:55:03,605
Forget it.

851
00:55:04,145 --> 00:55:06,882
I knew that you are a jerk
when you called me to that hotel.

852
00:55:07,139 --> 00:55:09,975
But I didn't know
that you are this cowardly,

853
00:55:10,358 --> 00:55:11,376
Chairman Lee.

854
00:55:14,346 --> 00:55:15,933
So, let me tell you this.

855
00:55:16,069 --> 00:55:19,480
With my fame
and connections with the VIPs,

856
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:22,267
isn't now the best time for me
to set up my own hospital?

857
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:25,315
Right when I return,

858
00:55:25,586 --> 00:55:28,736
I'll throw a resignation in your face,
so you just wait.

859
00:55:28,876 --> 00:55:30,006
Do you understand me?

860
00:55:40,318 --> 00:55:41,490
You heard everything, right?

861
00:55:42,316 --> 00:55:44,767
That is the reason why I'm here.

862
00:55:50,743 --> 00:55:52,042
The airplane is coming.

863
00:58:02,866 --> 00:58:06,868
It seems like the fate is colliding
while passing by.

864
00:58:38,157 --> 00:58:41,244
"Descendants Of The Sun"

865
00:58:41,586 --> 00:58:44,233
-Myeongju might be dispatched here.
-Here?

866
00:58:44,806 --> 00:58:45,766
Don't move.

867
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:47,678
What did I step on? Minesweep?

868
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:49,187
Were you doing well?

869
00:58:49,418 --> 00:58:53,100
Are you still sexy in the surgery room?

870
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,322
There was a road accident
up in the mountain.

871
00:58:55,487 --> 00:58:57,518
Wait for a little longer.
I'll come find you.

872
00:58:57,926 --> 00:59:02,412
I'm sorry that your concern for me,
got caught in your business.

873
00:59:03,154 --> 00:59:05,487
In the medical camp area,
FP Level II was announced.

874
00:59:05,589 --> 00:59:08,273
Our soldiers will never intervene.

875
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:09,509
If the patient dies...

876
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:10,237
What is this?

877
00:59:10,372 --> 00:59:12,892
...we can hold the doctor responsible.
