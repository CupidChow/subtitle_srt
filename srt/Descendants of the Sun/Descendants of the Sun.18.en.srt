1
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:08,892
How did this happen?

2
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:14,131
From rescuing haphazardly.

3
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,906
I am okay.

4
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,844
Did you hear?

5
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:30,914
I asked in my thoughts.

6
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,018
Yes. Very loudly.

7
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,793
I would like you to be okay.

8
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:45,896
With sincerity.

9
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,907
Then instead of clumsy words of comfort,

10
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,842
please do the thing
you do well, Captain.

11
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,677
The thing that I do well?

12
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,581
What are you talking about?

13
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,883
Joking.

14
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:11,021
Because I think what I need
the most now is a joke.

15
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,760
You are really pretty right now.

16
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:20,764
You can't see me though.

17
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:22,065
I saw you earlier.

18
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,402
You are someone who is always pretty.

19
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,971
Don't be serious.

20
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,339
It was a joke.

21
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:38,682
I really missed you.

22
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,720
No matter what I did,

23
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:46,857
I kept thinking of you.

24
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:55,966
I physically exhausted myself,

25
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:58,635
I tried hard,

26
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,806
I drank and tried everything.

27
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,378
Even then, I still missed you.

28
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,023
Was it something you
couldn't even think of?

29
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,461
Then think about it.

30
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,664
Because I'm being serious.

31
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,459
Please don't look at me.

32
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,702
Aren't there any dark,
shady places around here?

33
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,039
That's something mostly men would say.

34
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,277
Then...

35
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,946
should I try my best at being "shady"?

36
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,588
You did well today.

37
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,199
I need to hear your reply

38
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,434
so that I could even wipe your tears.

39
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:16,706
Look at me for a while.

40
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,089
Wow, how shameless.

41
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,327
Without even knowing what the land did.

42
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,896
I thought it would be a comfort.

43
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,065
I already received comfort.

44
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,100
From you.

45
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,777
For coming back...

46
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,613
thank you.

47
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,851
If you weren't here today, I probably

48
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,021
would have ran away.

49
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,793
If you have plans of running
away, then let's go together.

50
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,363
Running away... is more fun when a
man and a woman do it together.

51
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,728
What's the next song?

52
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,497
I'm not sure, because Dr.
Kang made the song selection.

53
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:52,180
If I had known that I would
die in a foreign country,

54
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:55,972
I would have lived a carefree life instead
of focusing on becoming a professor.

55
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,409
Yoo Si Jin, are you on your way?

56
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:02,812
You're not coming.
You're not on your way.

57
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,715
I don't think I can last
until you get here.

58
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,351
But still,

59
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:13,156
the first person to
find me would be you.

60
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:24,434
If I knew I would die
just like this, just...

61
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,671
I would have confessed
my sincere feelings.

62
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,675
I got kissed by an amazing man.

63
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,412
My heart was continually
fluttering because of that.

64
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,836
Oh my!

65
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,859
What are you doing?

66
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,196
-I'm not doing anything.
-You were doing something.

67
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,599
You looked like you were avoiding
people because you were so embarrassed.

68
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:33,060
-Why don't you just go on your way.
-You sure are brave.

69
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:36,172
To think about dating the Special
Forces Alpha Team Captain.

70
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,378
First Lieutenant Yoon, let
me ask you one thing.

71
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:46,015
Go ahead. Don't get all serious on me.

72
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,618
Military grounds is my territory.

73
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,620
First Lieutenant,

74
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:54,224
doesn't the work that your
boyfriend does bother you?

75
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:59,062
Aren't you scared he'd disappear or die?

76
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,564
I don't know well, but.

77
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:05,602
Sergeant First Class Seo also does
a dangerous job like Captain Yoo.

78
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:11,700
To be precise, using various land, water, and
air routes to penetrate behind enemy lines,

79
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:15,190
reconnaissance of warfare, intelligence
gathering, hostage rescue operation,

80
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,090
destruction of military facilities,
persuasion to surrender, etc.

81
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,182
Are assignments they carry out while
using their lives as collateral.

82
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,287
But then, more than the work he does,

83
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,290
I am more afraid of being away from him.

84
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:31,661
That's why, there's nothing to fear
now that we are under the same sky.

85
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,330
To put it simply, I'm blinded by love.

86
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,533
I am like that.

87
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,074
I heard you asked Myung Ju

88
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,878
if her boyfriend's job bothers her.

89
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:51,247
She tattled on me about that again?

90
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:53,416
She said I should hear
the answer from you.

91
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,920
What did Myung Ju say?

92
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,256
For First Lieutenant Yoon,

93
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:02,825
more than Sergeant First
Class Seo's work,

94
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,194
she's more scared of being
apart from each other.

95
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,063
What about us?

96
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:09,265
Will we...

97
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,302
be apart soon?

98
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,207
In the name list of the medical
team going back to Korea,

99
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,476
is your name in there?

100
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,079
It's not.

101
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,983
-It's not?
-That's right.

102
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,785
I'm not leaving.

103
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:30,420
Why?

104
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,724
-It's probably not because of me.
-It is because of you.

105
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:37,860
I said I'm not leaving because of you.

106
00:09:38,561 --> 00:09:42,365
Because I want to be with
you a little longer.

107
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,936
I think I confessed just now.

108
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,339
Should I apologize?

109
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:51,708
How do you know I'll
accept your apology?

110
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:52,068
You worked hard today. I have to go
prepare a roll call for the soldiers.

111
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:56,205
You worked so hard. I have
to go check on the patients.

112
00:10:57,273 --> 00:10:57,940
Power of unity.

113
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,800
She'll be really embarrassed later.

114
00:11:13,956 --> 00:11:15,825
He must have been really happy earlier.

115
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,627
I wish I could go take it off of her.

116
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,762
I wish I could go hit him.

117
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:23,232
What?

118
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,835
I wish I could hit you.

119
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:36,045
Sergeant First Class Seo, a package came
for you from a person named Shin Ji Young.

120
00:11:36,045 --> 00:11:37,814
Where are you? Over.

121
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,049
Where are you right now?

122
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:45,388
I'm in the dining hall.
Should I wait? Over.

123
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,309
Power of unity.

124
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:07,810
Power of unity.

125
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:09,879
Power of unity.

126
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,588
-You startled me!
-I need to check on this.

127
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:25,194
Oppa, have strength. Heart?
I miss you, Oppa. Heart?

128
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,098
Does Sergeant First Class
Seo have a younger sister?

129
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:30,800
Sergeant Seo is an only child!

130
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,568
And that wouldn't be my fault.

131
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,272
Can you do that?

132
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,152
Look at this.

133
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:52,021
What is that? Why is Yoo Si Jin there?

134
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:59,595
The day we met with Si Jin Oppa.
I am sending our memories.

135
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:05,268
These men... First Lieutenant
Yoon, get your gun.

136
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,437
It's a misunderstanding.

137
00:13:08,437 --> 00:13:09,872
It's a misunderstanding for sure.

138
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:13,376
Misunderstanding?

139
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:18,181
When the evidence is this
clear, a misunderstanding?

140
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,900
I get to see your best smile
in a picture like this.

141
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,152
That's not a smile.

142
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:27,390
It just looks like I'm smiling but I
just look funny. Isn't that right?

143
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:31,794
It's my younger cousin. You already know that
my younger cousin is a flight attendant.

144
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:36,380
A package came from just your younger
cousin, but you two ran here as a set?

145
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,367
Because they played together in sets.

146
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,572
Of the two, who is the younger cousin?

147
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:43,539
-Yes?
-Excuse me?

148
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:46,809
You will both answer together. Sergeant
First Class Seo, is it the left or right?

149
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:47,877
1, 2, 3.

150
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:48,711
-Left.
-Right.

151
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:52,982
-Right.
-Left.

152
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:59,770
I only arranged a blind
date for the commander.

153
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,691
Nothing more, nothing less.

154
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,295
Are you throwing your fellow
soldier under the bus right now?

155
00:14:06,295 --> 00:14:07,163
Yes, I am.

156
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:13,035
You must have kept in touch with her while
in Urk, seeing that she knows this address.

157
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:17,273
Did you do that? Why on earth did you
do that, Sergeant First Class Seo?

158
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,375
I can't understand this man.

159
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:23,840
I just scolded him harshly.
I did well, didn't I?

160
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:26,148
Never mind that. Follow me.

161
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:28,130
Yes, I'm coming.

162
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,385
Aren't you going to stand still?

163
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:36,058
I thought she was talking to me. Because
it has become a habit for me to follow.

164
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,327
You should hurry and go.

165
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,364
I want to stay together.

166
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,236
Power of unity.

167
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:52,800
I really wish you would not
misunderstand. It's all in the past.

168
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:58,214
As if it was all in the past.
Then did this come from the past?

169
00:14:59,382 --> 00:15:00,516
It came from Seoul.

170
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,221
Is this the reason you were avoiding me?

171
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:07,280
I thought my dad was
the stumbling block.

172
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:09,320
It's true your father is
definitely the stumbling block.

173
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:10,493
What did you just say?

174
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,790
What did I just say now?

175
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:16,160
Never mind that. How far did you two go?

176
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:18,000
We went as far as the army entrance.

177
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,703
Am I asking about that right now?

178
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:24,300
How far did you go? Was
there skinship or not?

179
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:27,320
I didn't! It was really pure.

180
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:29,880
I only drank some tea.

181
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:31,480
What a gentleman.

182
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:32,615
You flatter me.

183
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:35,251
So you often enjoyed tea with a woman.

184
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:39,755
Here I thought when we parted, you'd don't even see
letter "w' in the word "woman" in this life again.

185
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:41,791
I felt sorry for you by myself,

186
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:44,093
not knowing you were
having such a great time.

187
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,696
I didn't live well.

188
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:51,500
And to be honest, it was due to that camaraderie
that I had no choice but to be dragged to it.

189
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:53,202
Camaraderie, yeah, right...

190
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:57,173
It's not that you couldn't help it, but your
face looks as if you couldn't contain yourself.

191
00:15:57,173 --> 00:15:58,074
You liked it so much.

192
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,676
I think you misunderstood because
you saw it for a short moment.

193
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:05,681
I kept a poker face. I only
drank tea with this expression.

194
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:07,817
You're kidding me.

195
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:10,280
How do I know if you only drank
tea with her or gave her a ride?

196
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:11,454
I did not drive her home.

197
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,291
If you lie then the situation
will only get worse.

198
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,429
I did give her a ride.

199
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:24,333
It wasn't my car. It was
the commander's car.

200
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:30,373
I really couldn't understand
why he brought the car.

201
00:16:30,706 --> 00:16:32,520
You're expecting me to
believe that, aren't you?

202
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,276
I'm telling you so that you can forget.

203
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:37,346
I really don't even
remember her name now.

204
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:42,218
You don't even remember her name but you ran the
moment you heard the three words "Shin Ji Young?"

205
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,520
That's not the case.

206
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,622
I'm seriously so annoyed. I'm irritated!

207
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,240
Know that you're saved
because of this person.

208
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,195
Who is it? Is it a man?

209
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:55,598
I think it's not the right
time to be asking that.

210
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,800
What are you going to do
if it's a woman or a man?

211
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,736
If it's a woman, I should treat her for a meal and
if it's a man, I should treat him to a drink.

212
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:02,905
Because I owe them.

213
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:07,777
It's the Chairman! Why?

214
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,283
"It's the chairman. Why?"

215
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:22,158
We looked everywhere. We cannot find it.

216
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:23,592
Did you really?

217
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:29,098
You didn't look through his stomach.

218
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:59,328
Put your guns down! Get down!

219
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,263
Hands up!

220
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,257
Don't move.

221
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,426
If you do,

222
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,029
you will die this time.

223
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,205
Target secured.

224
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,711
The target is safe.

225
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,817
Do we really just leave
the rest of them?

226
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:03,792
According to our tactical plan, we are
only to take our country's bad guy.

227
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:07,563
The Alpha Team will retreat immediately.

228
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,758
Did this patient really
swallow diamonds?

229
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:40,160
Yeah. I think we will really be able to see
"blood diamonds." Please hold this for me.

230
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:40,996
Okay.

231
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,403
I'm sorry.

232
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:49,420
I think I got the wrong blood vessel.

233
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,406
I have it.

234
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,716
It's not a blood vessel. A tumor
on his lymph node has burst open.

235
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,854
His intestinal bleeding is from the diamonds,
so why does he have enlarged lymph nodes?

236
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,863
Everyone, stop what you are doing. Take your hands
off, and back away from the operating table!

237
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,232
Now!

238
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,612
Come out with your hands up! Come on!

239
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,950
Don't shoot me with the gun!
We are Peacemakers!

240
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,015
Get down!

241
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:38,020
Come on, come on, come on, come on!
Let's go!

242
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,564
We'll standby at the field.

243
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,044
Whom are you going to meet with these?

244
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:05,247
Is it Private Ryan?

245
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,025
I think three are missing.

246
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:22,031
Even your jokes don't
make me feel better.

247
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,400
I'm very worried.

248
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:30,539
For people who do rough work, what do you
do when jokes don't solve the issue?

249
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:40,849
They lean on each other.

250
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:44,987
I see.

251
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:01,103
Amongst the worries you have now,
take away the ones about me.

252
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,406
Can you do that?

253
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:11,647
Please take good care of Myung Ju.

254
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:16,485
Captain, please take good
care of Captain Yoo as well.

255
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:19,822
Because I really like him a lot.

256
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,059
So that I can tell him when he comes.

257
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:13,409
Big Boss. He's smart, funny,

258
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:17,813
and mysterious,

259
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,585
but he has a lot of secrets.

260
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:29,458
He'll disappear from time to time.
Be hard to contact.

261
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,027
And then one day,

262
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:39,234
he'll never come back.

263
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:55,918
Let me use your last card.

264
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,822
I need a chopper.

265
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,058
Have a date again.

266
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:24,613
I've secured your retreat
route like you asked.

267
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,182
Let the hostage go.

268
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,397
Did you hit her?

269
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,101
All snipers on standby.

270
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:49,004
Wolf transmitting. I got his location.

271
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:52,610
Quit playing around and
let the helicopter land.

272
00:24:52,674 --> 00:24:54,209
Let her go first

273
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:57,246
or else it will not land.

274
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:01,383
I have to be in a safe
area first, or else.

275
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,024
Are you crazy?

276
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:12,127
I guess you can say that.

277
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:17,833
So don't scare her. Don't touch her.
Don't talk to her.

278
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,737
It's only me you should deal with.

279
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,173
Take me instead.

280
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,943
No, thank you.

281
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:34,149
It's much more fun traveling
with a beautiful lady.

282
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:48,997
I'm sorry for being late.

283
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:54,236
Don't move. Just stay where you are.

284
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:57,673
You trust me, right?

285
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,677
Be sure not to move.

286
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,649
What are you doing?

287
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,751
Take aim.

288
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:33,041
I've successfully removed the vest,
but I wasn't able to stop the timer.

289
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,610
Take cover!

290
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,719
Big Boss, to your left!

291
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,279
Forget about this.

292
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:37,039
The target has been shot,
and the hostage is safe.

293
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,344
I will disconnect the
radio and be on standby.

294
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,834
Do you want to break up with me?

295
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:27,155
-Alright, on to the next one boys!
-Captain, Captain! -Let's go!

296
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,380
-Look over there.
-The mask.

297
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:34,863
Okay, kimchi. One, two, three!

298
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:37,192
You forget this, too.

299
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:38,854
Before you arrived I made two
rounds at the Medi Cube.

300
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,559
I was happy for First Lieutenant
Yoon's fast recovery.

301
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,296
But when I was going to tie my hair,
there was no hair tie available.

302
00:30:48,697 --> 00:30:51,433
Even though I searched all
over, I couldn't find any.

303
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:55,737
Naturally, hair ties
are just consumables.

304
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,012
Starting from now on,

305
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:07,682
I am going to tell you all
the trivial matters, too.

306
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:12,254
What I mean is, I will try my best
to deal with the way you are.

307
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,789
So you should also

308
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:18,059
try your best to deal
with my chattiness.

309
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:21,730
But...

310
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:24,232
please promise me one thing in return.

311
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,304
Please give me the right
to become insecure.

312
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:34,409
All those times that you
won't be in front of me

313
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,845
can't always be a constant
insecurity or worry.

314
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,014
So...

315
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:44,119
when you are going to do something that should
really make me worry, then let me know.

316
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:45,854
For example,

317
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:48,790
if you tell me that you're
going to the department store,

318
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:52,661
then I will understand that you're
going on a difficult mission.

319
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,998
When you're going to be in
a life or death situation,

320
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:00,969
at least, don't make me laugh
"ha-ha-ho-ho" and be oblivious.

321
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:17,352
What you are worried about
won't ever happen, Dr. Kang.

322
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,221
I will promise you that.

323
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,193
I don't know.

324
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,230
You are so pretty.

325
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:31,232
I already know that.

326
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:54,222
That's exactly the face when
you're thinking about me.

327
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,192
It's my usual face.

328
00:32:57,970 --> 00:32:59,494
I'm always thinking of you.

329
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,864
What? That was kind of sweet.

330
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,067
You should be lying down.
Why are you out here?

331
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:08,603
It's boring in the patient ward.

332
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:13,208
Don't stand there.

333
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,442
Sit down.

334
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,414
Am I not totally lightweight?

335
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:24,520
I've lost weight after being sick for a
few days. My waist is tiny. Take a look.

336
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:25,520
I'm scared.

337
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,188
Put your hands right here.

338
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:33,995
Like you will open your present.
All you know is how to talk.

339
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,900
Move. Your face isn't that pretty.

340
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:39,300
If I move you'll be blinded.

341
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:42,404
If people saw, they would
think you loved me a lot.

342
00:33:43,905 --> 00:33:45,340
I love you, Yoon Myung Ju.

343
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,480
Are we

344
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:55,350
breaking up by any chance?

345
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,354
Are we really breaking up?

346
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,791
I love you...

347
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:05,727
very much.

348
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:08,463
For a very long time.

349
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,666
You kept breaking up with me
because you loved me though.

350
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,603
We won't be breaking up.

351
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:17,806
I will do that from now on.

352
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,680
Move over.

353
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:27,982
You are making me go blind.

354
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,313
Do you know that?

355
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:00,982
We have never said "I
love you" to each other.

356
00:35:01,483 --> 00:35:03,318
We did it with our bodies
instead of with words.

357
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:09,090
We held hands and even kissed without
saying "I love you" to one another.

358
00:35:09,491 --> 00:35:11,280
Wow, that's amazing. How daring.

359
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:12,640
How could you just say anything?

360
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:14,062
There's something that I couldn't say.

361
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,064
Let's say something
that we couldn't say.

362
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:18,566
Let's be fair and go alphabetically.

363
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,320
You should go first since
your name is Kang Mo Yeon.

364
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:22,303
The person that wants to hear
it should go first though.

365
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:23,972
Nope. Since it's ladies first.

366
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:26,374
If not, then let's go by age.

367
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:29,560
Why are you constantly trying to get me to say
it first? You didn't say it either, Captain Yoo.

368
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:31,513
-I love you.
-Oh, you startled me.

369
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:34,149
I love you.

370
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,919
Roger that.

371
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:41,322
I love you, too.

372
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:44,159
I will be loyal to you
with all that I have.

373
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:45,527
Okay.

374
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:48,029
Do you pledge to the flag?

375
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:48,963
Yes.

376
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,266
Power of unity.

377
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,736
Do I just put it in here?

378
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,338
But it's a little too erotic.

379
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,474
Ah, this lady!

380
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:02,177
It's still early in the evening.

381
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:10,251
We still have two and a half hours left until
our date. You're here early like last time.

382
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,157
What is it?

383
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:19,894
I guess you aren't here early.

384
00:36:21,296 --> 00:36:21,896
No.

385
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:24,299
The department store again?

386
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:25,633
Yes.

387
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:30,338
This time I'll be gone a little long.

388
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:33,374
I didn't think I'd have
any time except now,

389
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:35,710
so I wanted to see your
face before I left.

390
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:40,615
Are you making "Gomooshin" now?

391
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,717
Don't drink with another guy.

392
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,625
I'm sorry.

393
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,761
I was trying not to,
but it isn't working.

394
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:02,904
I'm sorry for making you have to try.

395
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,872
Come back quickly if you know that.

396
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:08,476
Don't get hurt. Don't be late.

397
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:11,312
I won't get hurt.

398
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:13,648
I won't die.

399
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,886
I'll be sure to come back. I promise.

400
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:37,472
Big Boss transmitting. The helicopter
transporting three civilians just departed.

401
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:39,941
Big Boss transmitting. The helicopter
transporting three civilians just departed.

402
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,700
We just have to wait ten
minutes to return home.

403
00:37:42,777 --> 00:37:43,878
Yes, Sir.

404
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,050
Captain!

405
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,857
Team Captain!

406
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:47,141
No...

407
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,678
Hurry up and get on. Let's go home!

408
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:58,152
We have to go back and drink soju
all night for three days straight.

409
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,089
Yes.

410
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,564
I will go.

411
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:13,234
What are you saying? Stay alert, Sir!

412
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,350
You can't fall asleep.
Look at me, Team Captain!

413
00:39:16,504 --> 00:39:18,106
Team Captain!

414
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,683
Big Boss, Wolf, do you hear me?!

415
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,351
What is the situation?

416
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:33,054
Anyone, please respond!

417
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,110
No! Team Captain!

418
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:42,230
Team Captain!

419
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:02,283
Where... What did he do?

420
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:04,552
How could you report such a thing?

421
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:11,526
I don't understand a single thing.

422
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:13,561
What do I do?

423
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:16,664
Aren't you going to report properly?

424
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:21,068
Do it as you usually do.

425
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:25,406
Say it again.

426
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:30,745
I said say it again!

427
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:50,665
Before we go on a
mission, we write a will.

428
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:56,370
I hope that this letter
will never be given to you.

429
00:40:57,530 --> 00:41:02,310
But if, by a rare chance, you are
reading this will right now,

430
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:05,246
then I have not been
able to keep my promise.

431
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:09,217
The promise for you not to be worried,

432
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:14,622
the promise not to be hurt,
the promise not to die,

433
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:17,992
the promise that I would
come back for sure...

434
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:23,798
I haven't kept a single one. I'm sorry.

435
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:29,804
The place that you are
in is always bright.

436
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:39,914
I met a person like you. Loved you.

437
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:46,621
And for leaving you like this,
I'm sorry for all that.

438
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:13,681
Why are you here like this?

439
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:16,784
Why are you crying?

440
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:20,321
If you are like this
then what should I do?

441
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:25,293
I can't even ask anything.

442
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:31,532
With what kind of mindset did I come here?
What should I do if you are being like this?

443
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:37,905
Didn't you say your father is in a high
position? Did you check everything?

444
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:41,375
They could have been wrong!
They might have made a mistake!

445
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:43,744
Are you crying after
finding everything out?

446
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:48,649
Don't cry and answer me, Yoon Myung Ju!

447
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:03,030
Is it true?

448
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:10,137
Are they really not coming?

449
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:14,408
Am I really... not going to
see that person anymore?

450
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:20,948
Really... is he not coming?

451
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:07,194
I know it's shameless, but I would
like for you not to cry for too long.

452
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:12,299
More than anyone, you have
to live well and brightly.

453
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:18,039
And also, don't remember
me for too long.

454
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:21,175
I'm asking this favor of you.

455
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:33,354
Please make way!

456
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:37,391
Please give me the scalpel.

457
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:39,980
Please adjust his breathing rate.

458
00:44:40,127 --> 00:44:40,628
Yes.

459
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:42,496
I will raise it a bit more.

460
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:52,406
Cheers.

461
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:58,145
It's delicious.

462
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:00,720
Drink slowly.

463
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:02,249
Why would I with something so delicious?

464
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:04,852
And go home today, too.

465
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:07,780
How many days has it been? The
interns are having a hard time.

466
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:09,223
They say it's hard because of me?

467
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:11,659
I didn't think of that.

468
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:14,620
I have a surgery tomorrow morning.

469
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:16,330
Stop going in the operating room, too.

470
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:19,867
I'm the sexiest when I'm
in the operating room.

471
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:28,075
Why?

472
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:32,179
Nothing. I just thought of something.

473
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:33,748
What are you thinking?

474
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:40,421
Just this and that.

475
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:46,527
Mineral water, wine,

476
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:51,832
candles, X-ray pictures,

477
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:53,934
hair tie.

478
00:45:57,250 --> 00:45:58,739
I'm crazy, really.

479
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:02,943
What's that? Why are you smiling?
Are you really crazy?

480
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:06,247
I thought I was okay.

481
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:10,951
But I'm really going crazy, Ji Soo.

482
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:41,115
I can do it.

483
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:46,821
Usually when you date, the things that you
can do yourself is done by the other person.

484
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:13,981
Every time, you risk
your life like this?

485
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:15,850
I am a man who is good at his job.

486
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:20,821
And part of my job is
not getting killed.

487
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:24,091
Liar.

488
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:28,896
I won't get hurt. I won't die.

489
00:47:32,090 --> 00:47:34,535
I will come back for sure. I promise.

490
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:42,009
Where do you get off lying?

491
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:44,278
I love you.

492
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:50,284
Don't make me laugh.
I don't believe you.

493
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:01,795
This is headquarters.

494
00:48:02,690 --> 00:48:04,231
Beauty, please come in.

495
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:07,701
Please bring some lidocaine
on your way back.

496
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:15,276
This is Beauty. Be there soon. Over.

497
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:39,300
Stay still over here.

498
00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:42,870
Big Boss transmitting.

499
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:07,161
What? I can even hear nonsense.

500
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:17,938
Big Boss transmitting.

501
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:39,960
Pretty One, turn around. Over.

502
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:05,119
This can't be.

503
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:15,062
This can't be.

504
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:19,266
This can't be.

505
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:54,902
It's been a really long time.

506
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:00,140
You...

507
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,578
You were alive?

508
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:11,085
I keep achieving that difficult mission.

509
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:39,346
I love you.

510
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:42,349
I said, I love you.

511
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:04,438
That day, First Lieutenant Yoon said,

512
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:08,475
"It's snowing for the
first time in 100 years."

513
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:17,084
And...

514
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:22,856
she said, "He appeared
through that snow."

515
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:50,517
My answer... is very late.

516
00:52:57,230 --> 00:52:59,193
I won't break up with you.

517
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:05,832
Even if I die, I'll never
break up with you.

518
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:51,044
We've really come back here.

519
00:53:52,713 --> 00:53:55,582
It's nice to be here with you...
even this time.

520
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:59,987
Because of you, I lost the chance to
come here again with another man.

521
00:54:01,054 --> 00:54:02,140
Another man?

522
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:05,592
Then, should I come here by myself?
With these beautiful looks?

523
00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:07,894
I don't have the capability
to come here alone.

524
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:10,197
You will stand right there.

525
00:54:10,464 --> 00:54:12,833
But doesn't this boat
look just like an X-ray?

526
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,400
You will not change the topic.

527
00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:15,869
Ah, wait a minute! Look at me.

528
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,137
That's perfect.

529
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:22,809
Because the only picture that
I have of you is that X-ray.

530
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,013
And I've seen that many times.

531
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,020
Even if it'semotional
appeal, I'm not letting it slide.

532
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:30,617
At the beach, it's always
"Catch me if you can," right?

533
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:32,352
Catch me if you can!

534
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:34,221
You are dead if I catch you.

535
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:44,097
But when are we leaving?

536
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:47,267
When that boat turns into
something like that.

537
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:53,407
Really? Wow! I'm alone with
a man on a deserted island!

538
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,776
It's awesome!

539
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:06,553
What exactly did you do to those stars?

540
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:10,290
How are all the stars in
the world appearing here?

541
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:11,925
You aren't going to make a wish?

542
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:15,796
I already made one.

543
00:55:15,890 --> 00:55:16,930
With your mouth open?

544
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:20,360
What's the use in laying around?

545
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:23,403
Hurry up and try to snatch
one of those stars for me.

546
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:30,811
I already snatched one. It's
sitting right next to me.

547
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,116
Say more.

548
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,052
You are very sparkly.

549
00:55:40,790 --> 00:55:42,155
Try one more.

550
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:51,398
My life became bright all of a sudden.

551
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,635
Don't mention it.

552
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:04,344
How did a woman like you come to me?

553
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:14,054
You must come to meet me
in the next life as well.

554
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:16,590
You've promised.

555
00:56:25,930 --> 00:56:27,100
What did you wish for?

556
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,000
You will be surprised.

557
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:32,139
What is it?

558
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:38,245
Please let this man... kiss me.

559
00:56:40,050 --> 00:56:41,248
Will it come true?

560
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:45,752
It's not like there isn't a way.

561
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:17,150
I love you.

562
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:22,522
Me, too.

563
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:26,626
It was a question.

564
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:33,667
I love you. This is my answer.

565
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:37,471
Me, too.
