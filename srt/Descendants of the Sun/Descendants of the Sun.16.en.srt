1
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,094
It can't be.

2
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,157
It's been a really long time.

3
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:45,595
You...

4
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,100
You were alive?

5
00:00:52,569 --> 00:00:57,240
I keep achieving that difficult mission.

6
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,821
You were alive.

7
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,058
You were alive.

8
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:18,128
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,166
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,152
Jerk.

11
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,122
Jerk. Is everything okay
just because you're alive?

12
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,190
Jerk.

13
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,268
I missed you.

14
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:01,238
There wasn't a moment I forgot you.

15
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:03,406
I don't need you.

16
00:02:04,574 --> 00:02:05,876
I'm going to live alone.

17
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,778
I'm going to be a monk.

18
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,055
I love you.

19
00:02:20,457 --> 00:02:21,858
I love you.

20
00:02:37,807 --> 00:02:39,342
Wow, it's amazing.

21
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,112
It doesn't usually snow in Urk.

22
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,452
If what I heard during my
deployment training was correct,

23
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,755
it's been 100 years
since it last snowed.

24
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,156
Wow.

25
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,302
That day, 1st Lt. Yoon said,

26
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,372
"It's snowing the first
time in 100 years."

27
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,116
And...

28
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,022
she said "he appeared
through that snow."

29
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:22,579
My answer... is very late.

30
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,620
I won't leave you.

31
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:37,193
Even if I die, I'll never leave you.

32
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,740
As I always emphasize, a soldier
who cannot protect himself,

33
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,451
cannot protect his
nation nor the beauties.

34
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,390
You are to remember just one thing
during operation. What is it?

35
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,623
Don't get hurt!

36
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,392
Good.

37
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:47,497
You have five minutes to gather before at the
military training ground with snow tools.

38
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,833
-Implement.
-Implement.

39
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:28,972
Hey, can the deputy platoon leader
be crying in front of his platoon?

40
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,979
How did your high school
equivalency test go?

41
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,281
I passed.

42
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,152
I'm now a high school graduate.

43
00:07:29,732 --> 00:07:31,234
I won't die again.

44
00:07:33,636 --> 00:07:38,208
Never again will I die even if I die.

45
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,681
I don't believe you.

46
00:07:49,586 --> 00:07:51,221
But please do that for sure.

47
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:54,858
It snowed for the first
time in 100 years.

48
00:07:55,758 --> 00:07:57,627
And you returned alive.

49
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,998
I used up all my luck in my lifetime,

50
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,002
so all I have left is you.

51
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,205
Okay.

52
00:08:10,106 --> 00:08:12,075
But how did you get here?

53
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,578
What about Si Jin?

54
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,014
When we went to report ourselves
being alive to Headquarters,

55
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,083
we heard about you.

56
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:24,954
We left Allied Forces Camp
right away and I came here,

57
00:08:25,955 --> 00:08:27,624
while Captain went to Albania.

58
00:08:28,157 --> 00:08:29,792
What happened to you two?

59
00:08:30,994 --> 00:08:33,730
You and Si Jin...

60
00:08:34,464 --> 00:08:37,033
You were soldiers killed in combat by a bomb
attack with bodies that were unrecoverable.

61
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,377
The militia were one foot
faster than the bomb attack.

62
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,414
Before the bomb attack, we
were dragged to a dugout.

63
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,951
We were locked up in that
unknown underground place,

64
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:00,356
and on approximately the
150th or 155th day...

65
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,036
Finish both and we're pulling out.
Hurry.

66
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:28,284
I will pay you back for the cookie
even if it's in the afterlife.

67
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,288
This is the payment for
the cookie I owed you.

68
00:09:33,456 --> 00:09:34,691
I wish you luck.

69
00:09:35,091 --> 00:09:37,393
I got the help of a friend

70
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,330
from that faraway place.

71
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:43,666
It's all set.

72
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,469
How did you know to come
with a broken arm again?

73
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,572
I was going to break it
as soon as you got here.

74
00:09:49,806 --> 00:09:51,507
My girlfriend's a doctor.

75
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,513
That doctor girlfriend put me in bed so.

76
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:00,750
I was hoping for a lot.

77
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,154
I missed your jokes.

78
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,158
You've worked hard.

79
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,729
Needle. Needle.

80
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,064
The needle. I'm sorry.

81
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,210
What do you have to be sorry for?

82
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,302
I am the one who is sorry.

83
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,641
What is the UN's radio code?

84
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:48,931
I won't do this again.

85
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,606
I am believing in this promise again.

86
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:03,579
I was curious since earlier.
What is that?

87
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,816
It is your memorial ritual food.

88
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,018
Today is your death anniversary.

89
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,356
As if I haven't done enough, I was preparing for
my boyfriend's death memorial ceremony table...

90
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:21,064
By chance... you're not, right?

91
00:11:21,464 --> 00:11:22,098
What?

92
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:23,866
Knock, knock.

93
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,070
Hi Beauty, here is your knife.

94
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,605
Can you see that person?

95
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:32,108
Yeah. He's very handsome. Boyfriend?

96
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,745
Thank God. I thought
I was seeing things.

97
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,647
-Thank you. Good night.
-Good night.

98
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:43,386
You killed me twice.

99
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,855
Did you just treat me as a ghost,
even though you're a doctor?!

100
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,590
When you studied science?

101
00:11:47,824 --> 00:11:49,659
Who told you to show up on the
anniversary of your death?

102
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,320
Whether you are a human or
a ghost, eat the fruits,

103
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,030
since I prepared them for you to eat.

104
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,164
Drink the wine as well.

105
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,300
I couldn't bring cheongju,
so it's in place of that.

106
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,536
You prepared a lot. Far
away in a foreign land.

107
00:12:04,006 --> 00:12:04,941
Wait a minute.

108
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,682
How come you didn't call at all, wench?
I was worried.

109
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,370
I am sorry. I was super busy.

110
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,280
-Busy my ass.
-Sunbae!

111
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:17,930
Dr. Kang!

112
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,021
Seriously.

113
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,450
Why a video call? It's making me blush.

114
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:24,727
Hey! I can't see that heated
face of yours, so stand over in the light.

115
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:25,962
Okay.

116
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,830
Here?

117
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,972
I am not the only one seeing, right?

118
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:40,610
I also see him.

119
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,714
Are you okay? You don't see him?

120
00:12:45,114 --> 00:12:45,815
See what?

121
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,587
Today is Captain Yoo's
death anniversary, right?

122
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:57,693
Then... That is the memorial
ceremony table, and...

123
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:01,197
Oh... that's true. He came to eat the
food off of his ceremonial table...

124
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,640
Wow, this woman tried to kill
me three times. Is it fun?

125
00:13:10,673 --> 00:13:13,576
You aren't planning to do this kind
of event after coming back alive?

126
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,045
But my team is really cute, right?

127
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,748
They must have caught on!

128
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:25,021
Sunbae, listen to me
carefully from now on.

129
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,191
Please don't ask me for reasons.

130
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,292
What is it?

131
00:13:29,525 --> 00:13:30,893
That you love him...

132
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,429
That you missed him...

133
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,866
Express it to your heart's content...

134
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,836
So that he won't have lingering
attachments to this world.

135
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,337
What?

136
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,773
Even though you won't believe it,

137
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,443
Captain Yoo is over there.

138
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,514
Please tell him to go to a good place.

139
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,151
I can go crazy.

140
00:13:55,384 --> 00:13:57,320
They are telling you to leave
as soon as you got here.

141
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,330
If you tell me to leave
already, I will be upset.

142
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,520
Wow!

143
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,460
Oh my gosh.

144
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,362
Hello, everyone.

145
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,867
Now, this is Captain
Yoo's current state.

146
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,669
So you know how happy I will be tonight?

147
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:16,105
I will explain the
details when I go back.

148
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,242
Stop bothering me for today.
I will hang up. Bye.

149
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:24,150
-It was Captain Yoo, right? Right?
-Right.

150
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,649
-He wasn't a ghost, right?
-I think so.-I'm not seeing things, right?

151
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:39,428
Attention! To our Commander...

152
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:40,897
Thank you.

153
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,701
I am really grateful that
you guys came back alive.

154
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:52,942
Captain Yoo Si Jin.

155
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,045
Sergeant First Class Seo Dae Young.

156
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,016
Hey, you punks!

157
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:05,288
When I think about how much I suffered because
of you I don't even want to look at you...

158
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:10,860
I got promoted to colonel while you two
were gone, but this kind of thin...

159
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,095
Getting promoted a little
sooner than my colleagues...

160
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,450
Team Leader!

161
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:17,180
Having a nice photo of me in interview with The
Korea Defense Daily. Why would they be important?

162
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:19,790
Team Leader! Team Leader!

163
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,530
To me, in the world,
you two are the most...

164
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:29,011
Ah, seriously!

165
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:32,315
You're here!

166
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,310
Yoo Si Jin and Seo Dae Young will write
reports in place of work for the time being.

167
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:39,221
The report should be
as thick as the Bible.

168
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,958
-We'll be going.
-Goodbye.

169
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,026
Hey.

170
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:54,136
-What are you doing?
-I'm more scared of A4 than I am of C4.

171
00:15:55,638 --> 00:15:57,406
Look at this sharp corner.

172
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,643
If you get cut... Wow, it hurts a lot.

173
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,414
On the wrist of the bastard
that was waterboarding us,

174
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,650
I think there was a tattoo of Spetsnaz.

175
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,218
That was the guy who knifed us.

176
00:16:10,786 --> 00:16:13,456
But it makes us look bad if we
only write about being beat up,

177
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,570
so let's say that once a
week we counterattacked

178
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,626
and that we attempted
to escape once monthly.

179
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,170
Let's try and write it honestly.

180
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,263
We did that "twice" monthly.

181
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:25,901
They won't try to confirm
it with the militia, right?

182
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,971
Given our situation, they will
believe anything we write.

183
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,542
But the problem is, we need an appropriate
balance between reality and drama.

184
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,712
How about using Rambo as a guideline?

185
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,270
Since it took place
during the Vietnam War,

186
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,851
neither the weapons nor
the details will fit.

187
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,053
I'd rather go with the
Bourne series instead.

188
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:46,255
First Lieutenant Yoon likes Matt Damon.

189
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:49,325
It is perfect. Then I will leave.

190
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:50,693
Where are you going?

191
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,496
You have to write it alone.
If we write it separately,

192
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:55,464
whether we struck three
times or five times,

193
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,310
these details might not line up.

194
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,001
But why is that "alone," me?

195
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,970
Isn't 1st Lieutenant Yoon in Urk?

196
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:05,107
To the soldier whose girlfriend
isn't in Korea, good luck!

197
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:14,483
Do you remember dumping me here?

198
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,185
Of course.

199
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,520
I may dump you again today.

200
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:22,792
You are kidding, right?
I've been traumatized.

201
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,026
I'm serious.

202
00:17:27,196 --> 00:17:28,798
That's why I'm asking.

203
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:32,301
In the future, will you also keep doing

204
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,336
the work that has you going
to the department store?

205
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,506
I was wondering if it's because
you wish to be a hero.

206
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,678
If the story's hero must die,

207
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,914
there is not one soldier who
would be interested in it.

208
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:46,449
Right?

209
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,719
We just protect peace in places
that need their peace protected.

210
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,689
I guess you mean you will keep doing
it even though I object to it?

211
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,157
Will you object?

212
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,792
Should I not?

213
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,897
Even if this time, you may
never ever come back?

214
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,870
Don't get anxious. I won't object.

215
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,473
What's the use in objecting to it?

216
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:13,943
Even if you're sorry,
you won't give it up.

217
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:17,813
And I'll resent you, but
end up supporting you.

218
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:21,016
If I'm going to be that way,
I'd rather keep my peace, too.

219
00:18:22,151 --> 00:18:25,521
Of course, only if my
support brings you peace.

220
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,593
Thank you. And I'm sorry.

221
00:18:31,594 --> 00:18:35,397
I'm sorry that all I can
say is that I'm sorry.

222
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:39,902
Should we go fishing tomorrow
since you didn't get dumped?

223
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,438
It's a form of emotional therapy.

224
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:46,342
I'm going to put on my charm
so don't be startled, and

225
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,712
don't feel bad even if
I act really happy.

226
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:53,482
Be grateful for meeting
a girlfriend like me.

227
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:06,896
The view is beautiful and
my heart is at peace.

228
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,132
I feel the pain in my heart healing.

229
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,938
For two hours already, nothing's biting.

230
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,607
How is it that we haven't
caught a single fish?

231
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:24,713
Are you creating new trauma

232
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,050
to overcome the pre-existing trauma?

233
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,951
This won't work. At this rate,
I'll become too frustrated.

234
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:39,395
The arboretum is nearby.

235
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:40,980
I'll change my treatment plan.

236
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,665
Let's go for a walk while
breathing in fresh air.

237
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:46,202
Do you... know how many
kilometers I march a year?

238
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:49,004
Oh, there's a monastery, too.
How about a monastery?

239
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:52,308
Do you know how many months

240
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:54,577
I was trapped with only crew cut men?

241
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,512
Then what do you want to do?

242
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,714
Something conventional.

243
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:02,017
The weather's cold and
the fish aren't biting.

244
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,454
"Do you want to take a
rest?" Things like that.

245
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,123
Something like "By coincidence,
there's only one room left."

246
00:20:09,658 --> 00:20:10,780
Don't cross the line.

247
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,295
But that means we still will be sharing
a room together then.

248
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,120
Of Course.

249
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,632
You said that you won't lie in bed with a man.
That's what you said at the hospital last time.

250
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:17,833
That wasn't me.

251
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:20,369
She was a year younger than me.

252
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,870
She really doesn't
know much of anything.

253
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:22,972
Right?

254
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,542
I really didn't like that girl.

255
00:20:26,742 --> 00:20:27,776
I caught one.

256
00:20:27,876 --> 00:20:29,945
We should finish the rest
of our conversation.

257
00:20:30,746 --> 00:20:32,014
Is it me or the fish?

258
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:37,060
How can a special forces agent
be unable to touch a fish?

259
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,487
You even came back from being dead!

260
00:20:39,521 --> 00:20:41,690
I won't get hurt and I
won't die.However...

261
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,828
I really can't touch a fish.

262
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,598
You're so cute so I'll
let you slide this time.

263
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:52,501
We will start cutting the carp. Scalpel.

264
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:57,306
You are such a heartless woman.

265
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:05,514
That hotel looks very nice.

266
00:21:06,448 --> 00:21:08,284
The bed looks big and comfy.

267
00:21:08,651 --> 00:21:12,421
You fool. The bed is better
the smaller it is you know.

268
00:21:12,421 --> 00:21:13,656
Which bastard is it?

269
00:21:15,457 --> 00:21:17,826
What kind of bastard taught
you something so terrible?

270
00:21:18,761 --> 00:21:20,296
A bastard named Yoo Si Jin did.

271
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:23,565
I endured the time while
he was gone by doing this.

272
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:29,371
I should leave this there.
I should take this back.

273
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,274
Once I take this back I
should forget everything.

274
00:21:32,441 --> 00:21:34,043
I should forget and let him go.

275
00:21:34,476 --> 00:21:36,512
I bought a plane ticket
but cancelled it.

276
00:21:36,512 --> 00:21:38,314
I reserved a hotel but I
cancelled it as well.

277
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,416
I requested some time
off but I cancelled it.

278
00:21:42,184 --> 00:21:43,452
He was wrong for sure.

279
00:21:45,988 --> 00:21:50,192
Do you think we could
really go back there?

280
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,593
Who are you gonna go with?

281
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,095
With you!

282
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,130
That makes me look forward to it.

283
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,199
When are we leaving?

284
00:21:57,499 --> 00:21:59,268
I am not sure. You just
have to wait and see.

285
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:03,672
You have to try waiting
relentlessly like I did.

286
00:22:06,308 --> 00:22:09,511
If that's my punishment
then I'm willing to take it.

287
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,880
When all of a sudden, while we live
our lives I say, "Now is the time,"

288
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,718
come running to me with your passport.

289
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,058
But where's the line here?

290
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,990
I need to know where
so I won't go over it.

291
00:22:25,127 --> 00:22:25,830
You don't know?

292
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:28,520
Being stuck by you like this is so...
I am so cold right now.

293
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:29,732
You are so silly.

294
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:33,435
My glances. Your best.

295
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:36,538
That's good.

296
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,815
Not now.

297
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,319
You are such a difficult
woman for crying out loud.

298
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,904
Are you almost done with
writing the report?

299
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:12,040
I'm feeling the pain
of a writer's block.

300
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:14,780
Do you even know how to turn
on the Hangul Word software?

301
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:17,012
Sometimes I wonder what you take me for.

302
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:18,614
I see you as a man.

303
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:20,849
Aren't you busy?

304
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:23,118
I'm happy hearing your voice often.

305
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:28,424
Every time I wake up from
my sleep, I ask Ki Bum.

306
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,826
I ask if you coming back is all a dream.

307
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:34,660
Ki Bum came to me first
when I woke up today,

308
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:37,800
and he told me that, "Sergeant
Seo coming back isn't a dream."

309
00:23:39,034 --> 00:23:41,003
Even though I know that I can't help
but to constantly make sure of it.

310
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:44,106
It reassures me only after calling
you and hearing your voice.

311
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:45,707
You can call me anytime.

312
00:23:46,241 --> 00:23:47,609
I will answer your calls
even in my sleep.

313
00:23:48,477 --> 00:23:50,160
But I don't think I won't be able
to talk to you tomorrow though.

314
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,680
Because there will be a VIP ceremony.

315
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,349
VIP? Who is it?

316
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,957
Big Boss transmitting.
Has the VIP arrived?

317
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:07,062
Piccolo transmitting. From my current location,
I have secured a view of the vehicle in transit.

318
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:10,699
Snoopy transmitting. There is
nothing remarkable at the entrance.

319
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:13,368
Roger that. Everyone, head
towards the meeting place.

320
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,290
I will be in charge of
escorting the VIP myself.

321
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,260
Wolf transmitting. Big Boss should
standby at your current location.

322
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:21,410
Snoopy and I will be in charge of escorting the
VIP and managing their close-distance security.

323
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:24,012
Snoopy. Open the door.

324
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,447
Roger.

325
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:29,384
Wow, you guys are quick.

326
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:33,622
With that speed, you should run a Chinese
delivery instead of being a soldier!

327
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:42,231
Hello oppas. One. Two. Three.

328
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:45,890
"Happiness!" Nice to meet
you, we are Red Velvet.

329
00:24:46,001 --> 00:24:50,739
We salute to the Oppas of the
Special Forces. Power of Unity!

330
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,372
We love you Kang Seulgi!

331
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:00,509
Oh my gosh.

332
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,720
-What's wrong?
-What is it?

333
00:26:03,845 --> 00:26:05,180
My goodness.

334
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,282
Dr. Kang, you need to see this.

335
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:10,690
We love you Kang Seulgi!

336
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,590
We love you forever!

337
00:26:13,689 --> 00:26:17,100
If it's the 23rd, then that's the day when
Captain Yoo went on an operation, isn't it?

338
00:26:17,192 --> 00:26:18,790
Seems like he's involved
in a big "operation."

339
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,663
That's so true. There is no
better peace-keeping than this.

340
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,999
That's not captain Yoo.

341
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,245
Hold on a sec.

342
00:26:38,614 --> 00:26:41,283
-Excuse me... I'm sorry, but...
-Yes?

343
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,220
Would it be okay to ask you a favor?
It's not on the script though.

344
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:45,487
Go ahead please.

345
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:50,258
Would it be okay for you to ask if
I have a boyfriend on the show?

346
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,280
Kang Mo Yeon's 'Body Check' Season two.

347
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:56,531
Today we learned about high cholesterol.

348
00:26:56,732 --> 00:27:01,036
Before we end, I will be asking a question that
the audiences have been very curious about.

349
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,472
Dr Kang, you're not married yet right?

350
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,174
Do you have a boyfriend by any chance?

351
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,810
You're asking me about
that so suddenly...

352
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:11,140
In order for you to prevent
a having high cholesterol,

353
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:15,317
it would be good to have a boyfriend who I
could exercise with but I don't have one.

354
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:16,585
Because I'm so busy.

355
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,623
I watched the broadcast.

356
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:26,061
So you don't have a boyfriend...
since you're busy?

357
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:27,996
Then what am I?

358
00:27:29,698 --> 00:27:31,920
I guess I'm your best friend.
A best friend who's a soldier.

359
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:34,636
My boyfriend was playing on broadcast
as if he didn't have a girlfriend,

360
00:27:34,636 --> 00:27:36,438
so I thought we promised as such.

361
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,306
I also watched the broadcast well.

362
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,042
You went wild with a girl group.

363
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,377
Soldier 1 and Soldier 2...

364
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:48,890
Wow. I never knew you
were such a good dancer.

365
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,120
That's a misunderstanding. I think
I was blind-sighted by "evil" editing.

366
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,180
Oh... "evil" editing?

367
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:56,258
Yes, that's right.

368
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,295
I was actually just cheering when
the battalion commander arrived,

369
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,031
but it just happened to
be edited like that.

370
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:07,536
So you whistled like crazy after
seeing the battalion commander?

371
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:10,440
Does your battalion commander
have "milky skin"?

372
00:28:10,539 --> 00:28:12,941
The battalion commander
has relatively nice skin.

373
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,913
I am going to kill you. You
liked Red Velvet that much?

374
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:21,070
No matter what you do
I won't let you go.

375
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,170
You must be kidding me. On TV,
you seemed to have let me go.

376
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:26,621
There's only 157 days until I return.

377
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:31,026
For the next 157 days, I'm only going to
think about how I should kill Seo Dae Young.

378
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:32,327
You got that?

379
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,280
You're seriously being too harsh!

380
00:28:34,396 --> 00:28:36,631
"It's not like I committed a
deadly crime you know?"

381
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:43,438
Is something that childish men
would say to worsen the situation.

382
00:28:43,939 --> 00:28:46,875
But I am going bet my hopes on my
best efforts and your glances.

383
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:50,378
But I am going bet my hopes on my
best efforts and your glances.

384
00:28:50,746 --> 00:28:53,749
You go ahead but you have to
do your best first captain.

385
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,886
It's all because of my carelessness.

386
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:00,080
Red Velvet isn't at fault.

387
00:29:00,188 --> 00:29:01,620
Let's die in my hands today.

388
00:29:01,723 --> 00:29:04,926
Wait. Hold on.

389
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,940
And to let you know, I
am no longer a captain.

390
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,296
What are you then if
you are not a captain?

391
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,200
Did you get fired from the military?

392
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:16,338
No it's not that. I am
just getting promoted.

393
00:29:17,139 --> 00:29:18,039
Seriously?

394
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,620
Why are you so happy Dr Kang?

395
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,130
That means you'll get a pay increase.

396
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,513
Why would you have to be so
happy about that, Dr Kang?

397
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,949
Why are you doing your
eyes like that for?

398
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,385
Your best and my glances.

399
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,488
Look at that snobbery.

400
00:29:34,055 --> 00:29:39,427
I report. Starting from March 25th of 2016, I
Captain Yoo Si Jin will be going from Captain to

401
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:42,764
a Major and receive an order to
get a pay increase at this rank.

402
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:44,266
Yes, I report to you sir.

403
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,402
-Power of Unity.
-Power of unity.

404
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:58,480
The man that I am drawn to

405
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:04,853
is the only one in this world,
that lives as a soldier of Korea.

406
00:30:07,422 --> 00:30:11,920
As usual, he still believes that the old, the
beautiful and children should be protected.

407
00:30:11,993 --> 00:30:14,496
An honorable Major in
special task force.

408
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:20,635
And I am... as usual a broadcast doctor.

409
00:30:24,272 --> 00:30:27,375
Of course it's Haesung Hospital.

410
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:32,314
You know who I am without having
to explain myself, right?

411
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,640
Yes.

412
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:40,255
From that day onward, 157 days, I have
pondered on how I should kill you.

413
00:30:41,122 --> 00:30:45,327
That means the entire time I was on
dispatch I only thought of you. And then.

414
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,631
I missed you so much that I could die.

415
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:00,342
But still, you came back alive.
Isn't that admirable?

416
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:02,811
It's nice to see you healthy.

417
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,881
Then, cheers.

418
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:15,423
I am going to meet the Commander
tomorrow. Holding your hand tightly.

419
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,528
We need to finish talking about that.

420
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,598
We don't need to. I won't
take off my uniform.

421
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:25,901
Aside from when you're the one
taking it off, I won't take it off.

422
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:30,538
-Really?
-I will tell the Commander tomorrow also.

423
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:33,441
Holding your hand tightly.

424
00:31:34,843 --> 00:31:37,345
Let's go early in the morning.
Let's go before the sun rises

425
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:40,048
I also have a plan.

426
00:31:40,949 --> 00:31:42,317
You want to go there drunk?

427
00:31:43,718 --> 00:31:45,854
It's alcohol that I haven't
had for two seasons.

428
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:47,789
Yes.

429
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,692
Here.

430
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,362
Yes.

431
00:32:02,037 --> 00:32:04,739
As you promised, two cups of
tea, I will have it today.

432
00:32:06,474 --> 00:32:09,210
Let us. Sit. You too.

433
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,470
Two cups of tea.

434
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,983
Dad, I'm pregnant.

435
00:32:20,822 --> 00:32:23,391
No. That's not true.
That's really not true.

436
00:32:23,959 --> 00:32:25,093
Is that your plan?

437
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:29,264
Normally, they do it then confess but
my plan is to confess before doing it.

438
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,800
When your power is weak, a
preemptive strike is the answer.

439
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:35,570
Does she have to be here?

440
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:41,840
Speak. Whether it's an preemptive strike
or a carpet bombing, I'll hear it.

441
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:45,880
You stay still.

442
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:51,619
If I go straight to the point, the promise
I made with you on taking off my uniform,

443
00:32:52,454 --> 00:32:53,855
I think I won't be able to keep it.

444
00:32:55,924 --> 00:32:56,691
Is that so?

445
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:03,631
Locked up in a basement somewhere unknown,
having my flesh torn and bones broken

446
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:07,202
I don't regret those becoming a soldier.

447
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:11,639
At the best, I think the country
should not lose a soldier like me.

448
00:33:12,974 --> 00:33:15,844
I want to take off my uniform on the
day where it would be an honor.

449
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:20,115
I will find another way to
be acknowledged by you.

450
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,586
Right now, it's not a problem
where I acknowledge you or not.

451
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:33,094
The country has
acknowledged Sergeant Seo.

452
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:40,201
And as your superior, it is an honor
to have you as my son-in-law.

453
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:43,138
Dad.

454
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:46,508
When I sent you off,

455
00:33:46,808 --> 00:33:50,245
I gave you my permission. And for using that
method as my permission, I regretted it deeply.

456
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:56,851
For now, I am sincerely
happy about your decision.

457
00:33:58,219 --> 00:33:59,220
Thank you.

458
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:02,724
Dad!

459
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,832
My daughter... I leave her in your care.

460
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:14,302
Yes, I understand.

461
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:24,279
Sergeant Seo's guardian.

462
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:27,949
Princess Mo Yeon?

463
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:32,487
Our relationship... it seems like we
have to get caught up in a man to meet.

464
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:37,058
Did you go and come back safely?

465
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,661
As you can see, I am healthy.

466
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:44,365
What happened to your
war with Sergeant Seo?

467
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,802
Not a truce but a cessation of war.
We got my dad's approval too.

468
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:52,250
Really? Congratulations! Before it gets too
late we should drink in broad daylight.

469
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,741
I'm good whenever it is.

470
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:56,911
But then today, I came
here for another reason.

471
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,624
Unni, hello. It's me Fatima.

472
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:11,626
I am learning Korean.

473
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:15,029
Later, I want to be a doctor like you.

474
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:20,668
Merry Christmas. And tell
the ahjussi's my message.

475
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:23,404
I miss you and I love you.

476
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,810
There's worth in spending money.

477
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:35,470
I'm sorry. I'll use the computer.

478
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:36,718
Yes.

479
00:35:37,652 --> 00:35:38,386
Here.

480
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:43,710
Nurse Ha, what is the password
that Doctor Song uses often?

481
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,460
Genius Song Sang Hyeon.

482
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:53,000
Come here, it's news from Urk that
First Lieutenant Yoon brought.

483
00:35:53,101 --> 00:35:55,170
-Really?
-Urk?

484
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,546
Oh! It's Blekie.

485
00:36:05,446 --> 00:36:06,881
He grew so much!

486
00:36:07,882 --> 00:36:11,280
But still, if he were
to fit in those shoes

487
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:12,887
it would take so long.

488
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:24,199
Blekie, blekie. His name is blekie.

489
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,234
And also my name.

490
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,771
What is the mae?

491
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,241
It got blocked. Wait.

492
00:36:37,845 --> 00:36:39,347
And also my name.

493
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:43,785
My name.

494
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:56,064
I'm going crazy.

495
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,234
Mae what?

496
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,473
Goodbye. The name crumbled into pieces.

497
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:09,310
You are just Blekie. Forever.

498
00:37:10,078 --> 00:37:12,213
Wait. Don't turn it off.

499
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:16,490
If ever I die here, go
to my computer's Drive C.

500
00:37:16,584 --> 00:37:20,100
Under the hospital document
there should be a zipped file.

501
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:22,824
That folder. Make sure to delete it.

502
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:26,470
-What is in there?
-It would be worse than what you imagined.

503
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:34,535
C... My computer.

504
00:37:35,203 --> 00:37:36,537
Drive C.

505
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:42,010
Alright, wild bird.

506
00:37:48,082 --> 00:37:50,385
It was from 10's to 30's!

507
00:37:52,287 --> 00:37:56,991
He is just needs to get hit
severely from 10 to 30 so...

508
00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:00,420
Oh. I'm sorry. Are you alright?

509
00:39:00,555 --> 00:39:01,556
Let me.

510
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:04,292
-I'm her guardian.
-I'm sorry.

511
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:08,029
Guardian?

512
00:39:09,397 --> 00:39:11,666
Nevermind. It's because I'm tired.

513
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,841
If you're tired, sit down and rest instead
of resting in someone else's arms.

514
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,645
If you saw something then
you should have said so.

515
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:28,200
You saw it all. 1030. It was
all in the recycle bin.

516
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:30,518
-You told me to delete them.
-I said to delete it if I die.

517
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,287
-Why did you delete it?
-Why are you keeping it?

518
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:37,325
To propose. That's the proposal
that I was going to do.

519
00:39:37,592 --> 00:39:42,710
It's a confession that from 10's
to 30's it has always been you.

520
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,020
You... didn't you ever
think that was just pity?

521
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:47,969
What do you know? I
should know my feelings.

522
00:39:48,169 --> 00:39:50,471
With no suspicions, it is love.

523
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:52,650
Don't do it!

524
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:53,570
What confess?

525
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:55,309
Anything. I'll do it.

526
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:57,178
What confess?

527
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,847
Yes, after I've paid you back.

528
00:40:00,047 --> 00:40:03,284
Alright then. Are you
being serious? Hey!

529
00:40:03,851 --> 00:40:05,820
Hey where are you going in the middle of talking?
-To make some money.

530
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:08,950
Can't you make money faster? Cant
we say you've just paid me back?

531
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,825
Can't you borrow some from Kang Mo Yeon?

532
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,340
Why am I driving this car?

533
00:40:28,476 --> 00:40:31,200
Continue straight. Quickly Big Boss.

534
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:32,360
I'm flying right now.

535
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:35,316
No not you but this guy.

536
00:40:35,316 --> 00:40:37,285
This guy's name is "Big Boss."

537
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:38,686
Seriously?

538
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,756
Do you like me that much?

539
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:44,192
-To use my call name on your car?
-Yes!

540
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:45,426
You scared me.

541
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:50,531
Make a u-turn right over here. I
need to give "Big Boss" a washing.

542
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,600
Not this "Big Boss."

543
00:40:54,135 --> 00:40:55,603
What strange timing.

544
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:58,610
I still don't know why
I'm driving this car?

545
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:01,809
Just do it for me. I'll
end up messing him up.

546
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,779
My "Big Boss" is never
getting messed up.

547
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,682
The timing is still odd.

548
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:26,601
Should I just give up dating?

549
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,436
It's so cold.

550
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,837
What?

551
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:34,175
That I love you. Put the windows
up it's windy and cold.

552
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,081
I need to come out now.

553
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:44,285
I said it's cold.

554
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:52,500
If I push this... water comes out.

555
00:41:52,627 --> 00:41:54,128
You got the target.

556
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:58,666
I'm sorry what should I do?
Now, I've ruined your clothes.

557
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:05,573
Put this own yourself. Your
clothes are see through.

558
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:08,209
I don't like other girls looking.

559
00:42:09,076 --> 00:42:11,913
I should do this dating thing.
It's risque.

560
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:12,910
I am?

561
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:15,883
You're most risque when you're laughing.

562
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:18,085
Seriously.

563
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,089
It's cold. It's so cold.

564
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,160
Aigoo, aigoo, aigoo.

565
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:37,872
You're overstepping your bounds.

566
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:40,207
Report me.

567
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:48,220
I'd like to eat comfortably. I'm
going to get indigestion like this.

568
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:51,586
Come to the infirmary if you do.
I'll take care of you.

569
00:42:52,853 --> 00:42:56,691
That's a great idea. Get heartburn.

570
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,563
No, should I just break something.

571
00:43:05,566 --> 00:43:09,136
That won't do. You won't be able to
go to Canada if something is broken.

572
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:14,609
Daniel and Ye Hwa are getting married.

573
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:17,345
Is Daniel that doctor?

574
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:24,819
The reception is in Vancouver Canada.
We got an invitation.

575
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:26,454
Married?

576
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:29,260
Ye Hwa and Dr. Daniel?

577
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:32,026
This is the plane ticket
and hotel reservation.

578
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,794
Awesome.

579
00:43:34,095 --> 00:43:37,798
But that's odd. I thought
they were already married.

580
00:43:37,798 --> 00:43:40,650
No they aren't. He told me that
they are wording comrades!

581
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:43,170
They're just coworkers!

582
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:44,405
Really?

583
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:48,209
Ye Hwa's father was an
Oriental Medicine doctor

584
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:52,847
starting in Russia, without discriminating
those in independent movement, he treated them.

585
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:57,030
Her father, older brother, and
mother were shot by a gun.

586
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,019
Shot by a gun?

587
00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:03,280
Yes. Ye Hwa was the only one Daniel barely
saved. The ran to the Canadian Embassy.

588
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:06,327
Only Daniel could go in.
Russian Ye Hwa couldn't go.

589
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:10,431
As per international law, they
can't accept refugee applicants.

590
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,670
That's true. So what happened then.

591
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,070
So Daniel said I'll register
the marriage right away.

592
00:44:16,437 --> 00:44:19,874
Bring the paperwork. This
is my wife respect that.

593
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:24,011
That's how he saved Ye Hwa.

594
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:25,746
You guys talked about that?

595
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,717
When I mentioned your will, she
said she lost her family, too.

596
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:34,088
You read the will?

597
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:36,757
Why would I read that?

598
00:44:37,024 --> 00:44:39,090
I know you just wrote lyrics
to a song and copied.

599
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,020
I didn't.

600
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:41,028
Yea right.

601
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,532
My plan was always to run away.

602
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:51,806
You who is braver than anyone else loved
me who is more foolish than anyone else.

603
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:55,042
I was thankful and sorry.

604
00:44:56,550 --> 00:45:00,381
If you are reading this will,

605
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:05,052
this stupid me is hurting
you to the very end.

606
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:07,488
Don't forgive me.

607
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:14,595
And as much as I've thought about
you, I hope you'll be happy.

608
00:45:17,498 --> 00:45:21,802
My love burns for you, Yoon Myung Ju.
Whether I live or die,

609
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:24,472
that will never change.

610
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:31,912
Don't make things up. I'm
sure you didn't memorize it.

611
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:36,117
You carry it around with you?

612
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,132
Because I wrote it over a hundred times.

613
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:57,004
Because over a hundred times,
I wanted to go to you.

614
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:02,943
Attention!

615
00:46:08,215 --> 00:46:11,152
My subordinates will close their eyes.

616
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:38,679
My subordinates will
also close their eyes.

617
00:46:41,949 --> 00:46:43,083
Close your eyes.

618
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,412
To whom are you going to give
your congratulatory gift?

619
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:15,649
Most people will give it to Daniel's
side, so I'll give it to Ye Hwa.

620
00:47:16,684 --> 00:47:18,280
And forget everything
Daniel has done for you?

621
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:20,588
I'm already paying that
back in monthly donations.

622
00:47:21,455 --> 00:47:25,600
You probably don't know what kind of experience
that is since you don't know that way of life.

623
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:28,762
The person who was looking for 007's
briefcase of money must not be here today.

624
00:47:29,563 --> 00:47:31,332
That woman is going to
get some more beer.

625
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:34,635
I've been curious about this before,

626
00:47:35,236 --> 00:47:40,410
The pledging picture, why are you the
representative? Were you the top student?

627
00:47:40,507 --> 00:47:42,843
No. It's the representative for beauty.

628
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:49,520
It wasn't alphabetical? Since you're
Kang, you'd be first anywhere.

629
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:50,517
It isn't that.

630
00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:51,719
By age?

631
00:47:54,154 --> 00:47:58,392
I guess I didn't tell you. Tomorrow I'm
going for my juniors' oath taking.

632
00:47:58,592 --> 00:48:03,150
I got an invitation as an outstanding senior from
the school. An outstanding senior in school.

633
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:04,765
Do you have debts in school too?

634
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:06,901
Aren't you going home?

635
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:08,068
I'm going to be stuck in traffic.

636
00:48:08,068 --> 00:48:09,670
That was your excuse two hours ago.

637
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:12,720
It will be super traffic right now.
It's no joke in Yeouido right now.

638
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:16,844
Hippocrates said this, he
said this so many times.

639
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:22,182
"Some words stay in your mind, but
some words remain in your heart."

640
00:48:23,083 --> 00:48:25,152
Like for example, this.

641
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:27,810
Now that I have received approval to
engage in the medical profession.

642
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:31,170
I will practice my profession
with conscience and dignity.

643
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:34,461
I, as the nation's special
non-comissioned officer,

644
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:37,870
For the sake of the country and
the citizens, I will do my best.

645
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:43,437
Transcending religion, nationality,
race or social standing

646
00:48:43,771 --> 00:48:46,610
I will uphold my
responsibility to my patient.

647
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:49,209
To stand by the law

648
00:48:49,443 --> 00:48:52,570
I pledge to carry out the
duty wholeheartedly.

649
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:57,060
Even though I may face danger, I'll not use my
medical knowledge contrary to laws of humanity.

650
00:48:57,070 --> 00:49:03,324
Even though I may face danger, I will not
retreat in front of any kind of disaster.

651
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:09,596
Even in whatever kind of
gun, keep this land's peace.

652
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:18,539
Today countless Yoo Si Jins and countless
Kang Mo Yeons solemnly vowed to do that.

653
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:24,545
I hope for those solemn vows to be kept

654
00:49:25,579 --> 00:49:31,385
throughout the whole
earth, beneath the sun.

655
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:45,499
Now!

656
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:02,282
We've really come back here.

657
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:06,720
It's nice to be here with you...
even this time.

658
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,325
Because of you, I lost the chance to
come here again with another man.

659
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:14,180
Another man?

660
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:17,498
Then, should I come here by myself?
With this beauty?

661
00:50:17,865 --> 00:50:19,933
I don't have the capability
to come here alone.

662
00:50:21,330 --> 00:50:22,569
You will stand right there.

663
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:25,139
But, doesn't this boat
look just like an x-ray?

664
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:26,810
You will not change the topic.

665
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:28,342
Ah, wait a minute! Look at me.

666
00:50:28,842 --> 00:50:29,843
That's perfect.

667
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:36,083
Because the only picture that
I have of you is that x-ray.

668
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:39,153
And I've seen that many times.

669
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:41,400
Even if it's emotional
appeal, I'm not letting it slide.

670
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:43,857
At the beach, it's always
"catch me if you can", right?

671
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:45,893
Catch me if you can!

672
00:50:46,727 --> 00:50:48,128
You are dead if I catch you.

673
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,238
But, when are we leaving?

674
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,842
When that boat comes like that.

675
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:08,148
Really? Wow! I'm alone with a man!

676
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:10,784
It's daebak!

677
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:39,680
You're really not going to drink?

678
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:41,548
It's really good.

679
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:44,218
I really want to drink, but...

680
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:47,600
I have to drive... the boat.

681
00:51:47,754 --> 00:51:48,956
You said that we aren't leaving.

682
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:51,425
For whose benefit?

683
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:00,734
Is it good?

684
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:02,336
Yes.

685
00:52:04,104 --> 00:52:05,739
You look like you really want to drink.

686
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:08,642
It's not like there is
no other way, right?

687
00:52:10,944 --> 00:52:11,612
I know.

688
00:52:13,147 --> 00:52:17,117
Ah... that time, I was so nervous that
I thought that I was going to die.

689
00:52:17,451 --> 00:52:19,987
I am so nervous that I
could die right now.

690
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:23,257
There's alcohol at the beach.

691
00:52:25,092 --> 00:52:26,493
And there's a beauty too.

692
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:32,132
And the stars are falling like that.

693
00:52:36,503 --> 00:52:39,706
What in the world. You are kidding.

694
00:52:41,608 --> 00:52:43,377
It's the first time that
I've seen a shooting star.

695
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:48,148
What exactly did you do to those stars?

696
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:51,685
How are all the stars in
the world appearing here?

697
00:52:51,952 --> 00:52:53,387
You aren't going to make a wish?

698
00:52:56,070 --> 00:52:57,224
I already made one.

699
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:58,325
With your mouth open?

700
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:02,829
What's the use in laying around?
Hurry up,

701
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:04,998
Try and pick one of those stars for me.

702
00:53:08,702 --> 00:53:12,306
I already picked one. It's
sitting right next to me.

703
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:17,444
Say more.

704
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,549
You are very sparkling.

705
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:25,819
Try one more.

706
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,461
My life became bright all of a sudden.

707
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,199
Don't mention it.

708
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:47,975
How did a woman like you come to me?

709
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:51,979
You must have saved the
nation in your past life.

710
00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:55,382
No way, you must've been a
magistrate in your past life.

711
00:53:58,585 --> 00:54:00,440
I have advanced a lot in this life.

712
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:03,457
We might meet
again in the next life.

713
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:05,640
You are saving the world
in this life too.

714
00:54:07,194 --> 00:54:10,230
I have to at least save a
country to meet this woman.

715
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,165
Did I say that I'm going to meet you?

716
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:14,968
You aren't going to meet
me in the next life?

717
00:54:16,070 --> 00:54:18,005
If I say no, you're not
going to come to me?

718
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:22,309
You must come to meet me
in the next life as well.

719
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:24,778
You've promised.

720
00:54:34,254 --> 00:54:35,389
What did you wish for?

721
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:39,230
You will be surprised.

722
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:40,294
What is it?

723
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:46,433
Please let this man... kiss me.

724
00:54:48,468 --> 00:54:49,536
Will it come true?

725
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:54,107
It's not like there's no other way.

726
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:31,878
I love you.

727
00:55:36,149 --> 00:55:37,250
Me, too.

728
00:55:39,986 --> 00:55:41,355
It was a question.

729
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:48,428
I love you. This is my answer.

730
00:55:51,164 --> 00:55:52,265
Me, too.

731
00:56:19,526 --> 00:56:23,330
But in foreign countries, don't they
give presents, not money for weddings?

732
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,567
For marriages and funerals, cash payment is the
accepted truth across all ages and countries.

733
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:35,041
It's convenient for the giver
and useful for the receiver.

734
00:56:38,412 --> 00:56:39,212
Let's go.

735
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:48,422
The bride and groom are getting
changed and will soon be here.

736
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:52,492
Ye Hwa did look a bit pretty
since she was all dressed up.

737
00:56:52,926 --> 00:56:54,394
Her wedding dress was also unique.

738
00:56:54,394 --> 00:56:56,630
That view right now is also very unique.

739
00:56:58,198 --> 00:57:01,501
Gosh, can't you do something about that?

740
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:03,403
Why would you catch that?

741
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:06,773
Then, should I throw away the bouquet that the
bride used all her strength to throw far?

742
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:09,876
Leave him alone.

743
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:12,579
He is a man with many
memories of weddings.

744
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:14,648
Ex-girlfriend.

745
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,520
Don't you really like
this kind of ending?

746
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:23,557
We overcame all of life's
misfortunes with love

747
00:57:23,757 --> 00:57:25,826
and lived happily ever after
for a long, long time.

748
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:27,194
Ending.

749
00:57:31,064 --> 00:57:31,965
Kiss time?

750
00:57:32,265 --> 00:57:33,660
Are they having a show or something?

751
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,010
The entire city of Vancouver?

752
00:57:35,135 --> 00:57:37,050
Wow, the scale is different.

753
00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:38,670
This isn't a recall scene.

754
00:57:38,772 --> 00:57:40,273
But what's wrong with this
scene all of a sudden?

755
00:57:40,674 --> 00:57:43,610
I don't think the story's genre leaned
towards a rom-com or a melodrama.

756
00:57:44,978 --> 00:57:46,420
It was a volcano!

757
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:48,248
A volcano just erupted!

758
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:51,818
Oh my God! Oh my God!

759
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:55,800
I was wondering how on earth
we had this good fortune.

760
00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:57,700
We were supposed to have had dinner.

761
00:57:57,858 --> 00:57:59,125
It's already too late.

762
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:01,495
Get up.

763
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:02,629
Okay.

764
00:58:04,490 --> 00:58:06,433
Then, are we forgoing our vacation?

765
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,802
It looks like it's your turn this time.

766
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:12,272
It feels like an introduction
to a long report.

767
00:58:13,206 --> 00:58:13,940
Let's go.
