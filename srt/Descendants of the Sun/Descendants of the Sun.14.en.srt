1
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,150
He's had 2 liters of saline during
transport and his blood pressure is 80/50.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,223
It's a multiple gunshot wound.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,420
A gunshot wound?

4
00:00:11,828 --> 00:00:12,930
Please page more doctors.

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,198
I already received the call.
You take that patient.

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,360
How's the patient?

7
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,334
Yoo Shi Jin... Look at me.

8
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,003
Please look at me!

9
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,005
Can you hear my voice?

10
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,774
Why did you come to me like this?

11
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,177
Please open your eyes!

12
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:15,158
Senior Lieutenant An Jeong
Joon, why are you here?

13
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,696
I don't trust my own, so I
came far to see my friend.

14
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,701
Please... send me back up North.

15
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:28,238
Not to the South for asylum but North?

16
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:10,514
Bravo, 5-27 section.

17
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,049
Combat shooting in progress!
We need backup! Backup!

18
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,252
The target seems to be
Senior Lieutenant An!

19
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,889
Let go!

20
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,719
It's cardiac arrest!

21
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,557
150 joules charge. Clear. Shoot.

22
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,762
200 joules charge. Shoot.

23
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:06,169
His vitals are not coming back...

24
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:10,974
One, two, three... One, two, three...

25
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,510
Please come back!

26
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,048
Please come back. Please!

27
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:29,793
Do you have any ammo left?

28
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,096
I've got one shot in the chamber.
I'll stop the car.

29
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:38,034
10 meters, 5 meters... Now!

30
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,421
Don't do this...

31
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,192
How can you be like this? Please.

32
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,964
I said wake up, you bastard!

33
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,540
That hurts a lot.

34
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,109
His pulse... came back.

35
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,980
Yoo Shi Jin, are you conscious?

36
00:04:57,614 --> 00:04:58,982
Do you know where you are?

37
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:02,285
Can you see me? Can you hear my voice?

38
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,188
Where's Senior Lieutenant An?

39
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,123
What?

40
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,961
The patient who came
with me that was shot...

41
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,699
Is he alive?

42
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:20,337
Who is that? Who is he!

43
00:05:21,204 --> 00:05:22,939
Should you be worrying about
someone else right now?

44
00:05:23,506 --> 00:05:25,342
You nearly died just now!

45
00:05:25,942 --> 00:05:29,512
If I used a bit more charge, you could
have died! I couldn't save you then!

46
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,718
You look just like
something that's pretty...

47
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,586
You bastard!

48
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:45,290
The patient who got shot
and came in with me...

49
00:05:45,395 --> 00:05:46,796
Why are you getting up?

50
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,598
Who is that person you're talking about?

51
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,767
By any chance, did you
get in a fight with him?

52
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,800
Did he do this to you?

53
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:58,241
No... Friend... He's a
not close friend...

54
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,909
Where is he?

55
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:05,110
The patient that arrived
with the Captain...

56
00:06:05,215 --> 00:06:07,050
He's wreaking havoc!

57
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,753
Oh!

58
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,692
Don't come any closer...

59
00:06:16,226 --> 00:06:18,830
If you lay a finger on
me, I'll kill everyone.

60
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,132
If I don't take care of you right
now, you'll be the first to die.

61
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,601
You've already bled too much.

62
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,736
Shut your mouth.

63
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,874
We'll put down the gun,

64
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,943
so let's have the
doctor treat you first.

65
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,346
How can I trust South Korean doctors?

66
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,170
Is there a guarantee that I'll
survive in the operating room?

67
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,086
You should be more worried about what's
happening outside than in the operating room.

68
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,122
Whether it's the South or North
or whichever side you're on,

69
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:49,759
the only one who can
save you is a doctor.

70
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,161
I don't need it.

71
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,831
Don't move!

72
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,639
-He's in hypovolemic shock.
-Dr. Song is waiting for him at the OR 4.

73
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,174
We will be bringing him up now.

74
00:07:06,476 --> 00:07:07,777
Let me make a request.

75
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:13,183
I'd like for you to operate on him.

76
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:15,752
Listen everyone.

77
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,840
After he takes a whole-body
X-ray, tie him up on his bed.

78
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:20,690
If anything's broken, put a cast on him.

79
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,425
If he's disobedient, hit him.

80
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:29,499
Fortunately, there is no pressure on the
heart as it was tension pneumothorax.

81
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:31,468
His heart sounds normal as well.

82
00:07:34,404 --> 00:07:35,538
Please give me the scalpel.

83
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,119
What is that? It isn't a gunshot wound.

84
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,088
Seems like there is something inside.

85
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:56,493
Senior Lieutenant An Jeong Joon is an
ex-Special Task Force Member of the 11th Corps.

86
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,561
He is currently under the
Protection Squadron.

87
00:07:59,262 --> 00:08:02,031
The intelligence reported he was on
a leave during the 2nd Envoy Talks.

88
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,330
A punk who's supposedly on vacation engages in a
shoot out in the middle of Seoul in broad daylight?

89
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,138
Senior Lieutenant An was being pursued

90
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,908
and those were the ones pursuing him.

91
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,377
Assessing from their armed status,
maneuvers, quick reactions,

92
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,880
and tactical movements
during the kidnapping,

93
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,715
they must be specially
trained professionals.

94
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,585
They aren't Americans. I think they
are from somewhere near Russia.

95
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,187
Their identities have been confirmed.

96
00:08:24,454 --> 00:08:27,123
They are armed officers from
the Embassy of Matovniya.

97
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,770
Did you say armed diplomatic officers?

98
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:32,530
Yes, Senior Lieutenant An used a forged
Matovnian passport at the port of entry.

99
00:08:32,629 --> 00:08:34,397
They claim that is the reason
why they were pursuing him.

100
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:37,934
Armed diplomatic officers engaged in
a shoot-out for a forged passport?

101
00:08:39,335 --> 00:08:40,950
The excuse is too insincere.

102
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,505
You have worked hard. What should we do?

103
00:08:42,906 --> 00:08:45,308
According to the international law,
we have no jurisdiction over them.

104
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,344
We should dig more into Senior
Lieutenant An that we have on our side.

105
00:08:48,878 --> 00:08:52,048
I just got a call from the hospital. The surgery
on Senior Lieutenant An just finished earlier.

106
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,019
How did it go?

107
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,221
-About what?
-The surgery.

108
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:03,710
First, his life is saved. We have moved
him into the recovery room just now.

109
00:09:03,826 --> 00:09:05,328
He is still unconscious.

110
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:11,401
Besides that patient, there is another
patient who's life was just saved.

111
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,103
I guess that patient just
sees me as a doctor.

112
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:20,143
That doctor, an hour ago, crossed hell seeing his
boyfriend in emergency room for a cardiac arrest.

113
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:24,314
-I am sorry.
-Is that all?

114
00:09:24,614 --> 00:09:27,016
How about an explanation? You
don't have it this time either?

115
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,086
Aren't you curious if I am okay?

116
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:33,022
Even though you're affectionately asking about
that friend, you're not even that close with.

117
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:37,160
Just you get better,
because I will kill you.

118
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,830
This... I wouldn't have given
you this out of anger.

119
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,467
What is it?

120
00:09:45,468 --> 00:09:47,036
Why is this patient coming in here?

121
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:53,977
Power of unity.

122
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,115
From this point on, I will
control this patient's room.

123
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:02,719
We will put an access restriction on medical
personnel as well. We ask for your cooperation.

124
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,293
I heard you were looking for me.

125
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:15,164
I think Captain Yoo sent me into
the operating room for this.

126
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:17,367
This came out of the North
Korean patient's body.

127
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,004
-Really?
-Yes.

128
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:23,506
There's a rumor going around that the
patient is a North Korean soldier.

129
00:10:23,606 --> 00:10:25,700
But can you treat a North Korean person?

130
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:29,612
Of course we should. He's injured.
We did it before.

131
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:33,549
Aren't you scared? He even
came in with a gunshot wound.

132
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,360
I would have drank in broad daylight
if I'm met with a situation like that.

133
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,388
We saw even worse things in Urk.

134
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,890
All the soldiers blocked at gunpoint.

135
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:44,861
Going, "unity" and "unity" while the
guns are "click-click" loading.

136
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,829
Hands off. If you move, we'll shoot.

137
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,368
You're lying! Where do you
think you're selling medicine?

138
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:55,071
I'd like to give it a whack.

139
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:00,009
It's the news. Watching
it, curse words come out.

140
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,310
Hey, Ha Ja Ae!

141
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:07,250
I heard you were held hostage.
Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

142
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:10,060
Where is that punk? I'm
going to kill him halfway!

143
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:13,022
Dr. Song is bringing him back to
life after being halfway dead.

144
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,758
The patient I operated on was him?

145
00:11:16,893 --> 00:11:20,797
Ow, Heo Joon. Ow, Schweitzer.

146
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:28,800
All sorts of things, really. I heard your
boyfriend came in together with the North Korean.

147
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:31,007
The corridor was filled
with men wearing black.

148
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:35,611
How can you date a man like that? What
exactly is your boyfriend's identity?

149
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,916
You can say that again. I don't know
what kind of person he is either.

150
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:42,952
The chairman paged me.

151
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:43,886
Then this.

152
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,922
Why is she not taking my
opinion into consideration?

153
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:47,123
What is that?

154
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,859
The belongings of that patient.

155
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,595
Then these are all made in North Korea.

156
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:57,834
It doesn't write.

157
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:02,405
When a pen doesn't work, you
put saliva on it to use it.

158
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,042
I'll take these.

159
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:15,118
What did he say?

160
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:18,988
Ah, that pen isn't just a regular pen.
It contains poison.

161
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:22,725
So I almost died. Just now.

162
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,728
Are you okay?

163
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,065
Move aside.

164
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:32,702
I said to move!

165
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:37,040
How many hospitals are there in Gangnam that you
have to raise such a fuss at Haesung Hospital?

166
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,242
Especially at the most
expensive hospital!

167
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:42,478
We are doing out duty. We
ask for your cooperation.

168
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:43,880
This is the document that was sent.

169
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,548
It's being done out of order!

170
00:12:48,384 --> 00:12:53,022
Who on earth is Dr. Kang's boyfriend
that they are doing their duty?

171
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:55,558
And who is the man who was
brought in with him?

172
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:00,096
Did the two of them fight? Who won?

173
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:02,660
I'm not sure.

174
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:05,340
Ah, he lost. He lost. I can see he lost.

175
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,570
Who hasn't been to the
army, saying he can fight.

176
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:09,105
You were in the army?

177
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,008
What do you take me for?

178
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:12,850
The V.P.

179
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,544
I wasn't asking that!

180
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,520
Keep silence, please.

181
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:19,415
You keep the silence.
This is my hospital.

182
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:25,555
You should take responsibility and settle this.
As a guardian or as the physician in charge.

183
00:13:27,757 --> 00:13:29,158
Come here.

184
00:13:33,696 --> 00:13:37,266
I am Captain Yoo Si Jin of
the Korean Special Forces.

185
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:41,804
Captain An Jeong Joon, what
is your current affiliation?

186
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,844
What is the reason for your
entrance into South Korea?

187
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,151
What was the order you received?

188
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:04,293
Whatever you're here for, it appears it
failed if you're lying here like this.

189
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,761
Is that correct?

190
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:11,400
Captain An Jeong Joon, I ask
under Geneva Convention,

191
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,170
would you like to seek political asylum?

192
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,210
It sure is difficult to
even hear his voice.

193
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:24,614
If you were going to be this stubborn,
why didn't you just stay in North Korea.

194
00:14:25,982 --> 00:14:27,850
Did he even say a word
during all this time?

195
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,655
Everything is as I have reported.

196
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:37,093
Does it make sense to go through the trouble just to
ask to be sent to the north or is this rice liquor?

197
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:41,160
I don't know the reason but
through China and Russia

198
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:45,301
those public routes are blocked so you've
chosen the most dangerous South Korean route.

199
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:52,008
If you're in that kind of trouble, asylum is the
way. Just tell us and we'll receive you warmly.

200
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:58,080
I'll give you time to think about
it, so make the right calculations.

201
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,716
Help him punch in the numbers.

202
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:15,364
The items An Jeong Joon carried on him.

203
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,801
If being on leave was a cover-up and he
was carrying out an unusual black operation,

204
00:15:19,135 --> 00:15:20,800
the answer seems to lie in here.

205
00:15:25,408 --> 00:15:27,543
I'll take it today and try to
crack it as soon as possible.

206
00:15:31,881 --> 00:15:33,683
I'm going to go crazy.

207
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,218
What did he say? Is there any noise?

208
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,550
There isn't any word from the patient.
Team Captain Yoo is talking by himself.

209
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,140
What is he talking about? About
family, or convincing him?

210
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:43,960
That's...

211
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,664
If you put vinegar on noodles,
the vinegar flavor is strong.

212
00:15:48,664 --> 00:15:50,466
If you put hot mustard,
you can feel the hot mustard.

213
00:15:50,933 --> 00:15:51,467
What?

214
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:55,271
He's talking about buckwheat noodles.
What he taught him when they were eating.

215
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,106
Are they all crazy?

216
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:02,545
He knows full well we have to report in
and he's going on about hot mustard?

217
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:07,049
What's with that punk being so
unmanageable for a captain rank!

218
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:12,922
See? Look at this. What am I
supposed to do with this?

219
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,459
Yes, we're monitoring
the patient's room.

220
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:21,030
So, we don't know anything yet.

221
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:26,869
You call that a report?
The meeting is tomorrow.

222
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:31,700
The rep from the North is rushing to get here in
the middle of the night a day ahead of schedule.

223
00:16:31,807 --> 00:16:34,810
That Captain An or whatever, if we don't
hand him over by tomorrow morning...

224
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:38,848
There won't be a summit or whatever.
What's the plan now?

225
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:42,752
The North delegation has
just crossed into Seoul.

226
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,555
Already? How did he get here so soon?
From Pyongyang to Seoul.

227
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,992
For now, okay.

228
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:55,364
Hello. Report immediately
if anything comes out.

229
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,803
We're not talking about the top three
generals in the power battle here.

230
00:17:01,337 --> 00:17:05,680
Just for mere captain rank, high ranking officers
of North and South are working through the night,

231
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,276
hand-in-hand right now.

232
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:12,715
Wow. Does this make sense? What exactly
is the identity of Captain An?

233
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:17,953
Captain An is on the wanted list of the Interpol
for being the prime suspect of a murder.

234
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,120
Murder case? Not some
terrorism or assassination?

235
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:26,680
Two days ago in Tokyo, a key eye-witness
in a Yakuza crime on the way to testify

236
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:28,197
on the way to the courthouse

237
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,533
there was a murder case.

238
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,200
Is the suspect for that
case Senior Lieutenant Han?

239
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:37,440
No. The suspect's corpse was
discovered in the building up front.

240
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:41,811
Senior Lieutenant Ahn, is wanted as the
prime suspect of the second crime.

241
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:44,613
Who is the person that Senior
Lieutenant Ahn killed?

242
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,849
It's a face we're familiar with.

243
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:57,059
Sergeant Lee Seok Jin. From the special forces
of the 11th regiment just like Captain An.

244
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,262
He assassinated his subordinate
linked to the Yakuza.

245
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,230
It seems like it was the duty
of Senior Lieutenant Ahn.

246
00:18:02,364 --> 00:18:03,432
So then, why?

247
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:07,403
Has the contents of the SD chip from
Senior Lieutenant Ahn been found out?

248
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:10,980
It has been laid out sophisticatedly
so it would take a week.

249
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:15,080
But then, the North is asking to hand
over Senior Lieutenant Ahn tomorrow.

250
00:18:15,211 --> 00:18:18,820
And the South will refuse.
Then there isn't any time.

251
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,217
Getting him to open his
mouth is the quickest way.

252
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:25,087
He knows we're being tapped so
it's hard to get him to talk.

253
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:29,625
In times like this, usually a picture of
a mother or a sister would be helpful.

254
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:36,265
We'll try another method. First, we
need Doctor Kang and the SD chip.

255
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,135
Are you talking about the SD that
is evaluated in the headquarters?

256
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:40,569
I guess it'll be hard to snatch it out?

257
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:46,175
I think I made a mistake. I should've
made a copy before handing it in.

258
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,079
Are you talking about
something like this?

259
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,116
So insidious.

260
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,685
Then do you need me to send Dr.
Kang to the hospital room?

261
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,155
Between ankle and thigh,

262
00:18:59,155 --> 00:19:02,391
there's a bone fragment from previous
fracture that wasn't cut off properly.

263
00:19:02,825 --> 00:19:06,395
The gunshot injury is in four parts.
Just the new ones from this time.

264
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,704
The most serious is the old
shrapnel edged by your spine.

265
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:20,280
If we leave that in that could touch the dura
nerve and you could be paralyzed waist-down.

266
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:21,410
Patient Senior Lieutenant Ahn.

267
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:26,282
I'm saying that it is amazing
that you are still alive.

268
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:29,518
I'm saying how you shouldn't live your
one and only life recklessly.

269
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:31,921
There's also another person like that here.

270
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:35,191
That person who has
his senses elsewhere.

271
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:42,798
And I wasn't going to say this. That
soldier ahjussi that we saw in Urk.

272
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:45,868
Who are you talking about?

273
00:19:45,868 --> 00:19:49,650
You know that one that chewed me out for
performing surgery on the dying patient,

274
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,074
that rockfish-looking mister
what put you in punishment.

275
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,711
I saw earlier, he's telling our medical staff this
and that injection drug and this and that pills.

276
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,220
Are we his subordinates or something?

277
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:00,216
Why does he treat us
whichever way he pleases...

278
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,180
THERE IS SOMETHING GOING ON
BUT SWEARING IS PROHIBITED.

279
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,365
What are we gonna do?

280
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:30,710
So what I mean is that the soldier guy
probably knows what's going on by now right?

281
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,340
He probably knows that I am so glad to see him.
I almost ran to him and gave him a big hug.

282
00:20:35,551 --> 00:20:38,620
I think he knows everything since
he is such a wonderful man.

283
00:20:38,754 --> 00:20:40,289
He is an awesome man for sure.

284
00:20:40,689 --> 00:20:43,125
-Is your mother doing well Dr Kang?
-Pardon?

285
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:44,593
Well, yes.

286
00:20:44,593 --> 00:20:48,697
She's trying to get credit for side dishes she made
and she spends allowance I give on a regular basis.

287
00:20:49,598 --> 00:20:52,468
I need a quiet place to
speak with An Sang Hee.

288
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:55,604
He is doing well.

289
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:02,478
I didn't get to
acknowledge him properly.

290
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,647
You decide on the location though.

291
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,250
Do I really have to?

292
00:21:09,818 --> 00:21:13,522
I don't want to do it and my mom
wouldn't want me to do it either.

293
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:18,761
There will be nothing you
would have to worry about.

294
00:21:20,296 --> 00:21:21,964
You never seem to keep
your word about stuff.

295
00:21:25,234 --> 00:21:26,568
I ask of you to help me out.

296
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:37,446
Don't leave me behind next time
just because of getting drunk.

297
00:21:38,647 --> 00:21:41,180
Please come to the sitting room thirty minutes
after I send the patient An Sang Hee away.

298
00:21:41,317 --> 00:21:43,185
I have to do a few more examinations.

299
00:21:44,353 --> 00:21:47,156
Don't even be a minute late because
it will be packed with patients.

300
00:22:07,643 --> 00:22:10,820
Lieutenant colonel sir. It's so strange
to run into you like this again.

301
00:22:10,946 --> 00:22:12,881
Wow, it's so nice to see you sir.

302
00:22:13,349 --> 00:22:14,950
We'll say you ran into me
to give me a hug.

303
00:22:15,117 --> 00:22:15,751
What?

304
00:22:16,618 --> 00:22:19,780
We seem to always meet when there's
a lot going on in the country.

305
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:22,658
I know right? Well, then sir.

306
00:22:37,373 --> 00:22:40,576
What is it? What's going on? Don't you know
that we have fallen behind with other patients?

307
00:22:41,076 --> 00:22:42,010
Give me ten minutes here.

308
00:22:42,177 --> 00:22:44,813
This is the only place where they won't do
the wiretapping and be suspicious of me you know.

309
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,882
Wiretapping? Suspicion?

310
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:50,219
-What are you saying?
-You don't have to know and it's for your sake.

311
00:22:50,586 --> 00:22:53,455
I am working for our nation right now.

312
00:22:54,656 --> 00:22:57,526
Does this nation know that you
are working for yourself?

313
00:22:58,527 --> 00:23:01,764
Just promise me one thing.
Even if the nation denies me...

314
00:23:02,364 --> 00:23:05,267
-I hope that you will still remember me.
-I am gonna have to kill you.

315
00:23:06,168 --> 00:23:07,770
What is all this?

316
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,778
There's no wiretapping here
so you can talk comfortably.

317
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,652
I was able to get a space for us while getting away
from the monitoring eyes of our side of the team.

318
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:27,990
It won't be no longer than ten minutes. All
this means is that I just want to help you.

319
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:31,059
This is basically your last chance.

320
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,700
So what's the problem?

321
00:23:41,303 --> 00:23:42,905
First class sergeant, Lee Seok Jin.

322
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,842
So why did you kill?

323
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:51,046
Why don't you give me
my stuff back first.

324
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,619
Is this what you're looking for?

325
00:24:04,793 --> 00:24:06,929
Now it's your turn to answer me.

326
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:11,400
What's inside of that thing?

327
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:25,080
The special forces of our
republic that was finally trained

328
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,683
went to the mercenary market

329
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:31,386
and we were like a hitman from a crime
organization like mobsters and the Yakuzas.

330
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:34,389
There was supposed be some information
that was being sold at a very high price.

331
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:39,394
Mission accomplished.
Please confirm the deposit.

332
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:43,966
My mission was to punish all
the traitors of our republic

333
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:47,269
and reveal the power behind the deed.

334
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:51,807
Did you get the evidence that'll help
you reveal the person behind it?

335
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,943
You wouldn't want anything else from me.

336
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,883
I am sure that you
looked into it already.

337
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:05,487
The password was hung up in
such an intense way you know.

338
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,489
What is your password?

339
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,326
It would be even better if
you tell me what's inside.

340
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:17,666
None of your business.

341
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:21,036
Our republic will take
care of our own business.

342
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,437
The republic is...

343
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:25,774
seeming to be involved
in something already.

344
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:30,879
Head department security Choi

345
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,616
is on his way over here
so he can hand you over.

346
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:38,253
Tomorrow you will be

347
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,624
transferred back to the North.

348
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,903
Is this area also
possible for wiretapping?

349
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:57,539
No, not here.

350
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:01,577
I have a hard time breathing
in the hospital room.

351
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:05,714
This situation will be ending pretty
soon. Thanks for your help earlier.

352
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,749
I seriously hate you sometimes.

353
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,819
Were you able to have a good talk
with patient An Sang Hee?

354
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:11,820
I was able to, thanks to you.

355
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,225
Oh and his actual name is An Jung Joon.

356
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:19,394
His rank is pretty up there too.

357
00:26:21,096 --> 00:26:24,299
Is it okay for you to blurt out the name
of a North Korean person like this?

358
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,669
I just wanted someone to
remember it that's all.

359
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:33,208
Especially a brave person
like you, Dr.Kang.

360
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:43,085
I gave him some painkillers and tranquilizer
so he'll be deep asleep for about five hours.

361
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:47,482
Where are you going?

362
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,889
In the South you can't be discharged
without the doctor's permission.

363
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:59,728
Move out of the way. I need
to complete this mission.

364
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,832
I think I told you that you will be transferred
over to the North when morning comes.

365
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:09,971
Is your relations with
Mr.Choi a difficult one?

366
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,477
I thought about the reasons
why you came to me.

367
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:19,247
The reason why I am a friend
from a far away place is because

368
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,316
your enemy

369
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,954
is my enemy, isn't it?

370
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:32,427
Did you betray your homeland? Or...

371
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,364
did your homeland betray you?

372
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:47,075
A real warrior will never

373
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,643
betray his homeland.

374
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,127
Who is alive?

375
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,399
Is it the North Star?

376
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,503
Or is it Neptune?

377
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:16,938
Chief Comrade sir.

378
00:29:17,272 --> 00:29:22,177
You are like a hero drill instructor.

379
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:24,980
A traitor

380
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:27,816
is your plan sir?

381
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:36,158
To tell you the truth, the real traitor

382
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,194
is you.

383
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,213
I am asking you for a favor.

384
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,184
Let me run away.

385
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,219
If you go to the North,
they will kill you.

386
00:30:05,253 --> 00:30:07,189
Whether the traitor is
you or the republic.

387
00:30:07,289 --> 00:30:09,758
There's a mission that
I must put an end to.

388
00:30:10,258 --> 00:30:11,810
I told you you would die if you go.

389
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:15,096
Even if I die, I would die in the North.

390
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,033
Please let me go.

391
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,079
I am indeed a soldier who
follows the order given.

392
00:30:31,546 --> 00:30:33,248
I can't let you go.

393
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,418
The cost of the buckwheat
noodles in Pyongyang,

394
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,956
you have paid it enough
yesterday with that gun.

395
00:31:02,177 --> 00:31:03,445
It is a farewell gift.

396
00:31:04,479 --> 00:31:07,148
It tastes good, so eat it sparingly.

397
00:31:23,832 --> 00:31:25,734
Did you see your friend off safely?

398
00:31:26,501 --> 00:31:30,572
Your friend discharged himself from the hospital
without his doctor's permission. Via there.

399
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:36,311
We aren't that close to the extent
that he will say good bye to me.

400
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:41,340
Oh, the pain is back.

401
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,851
-Sit properly.
-Yes.

402
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,021
Did you break that window glass?

403
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,925
I didn't break it. The guy
who got discharged broke it.

404
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:52,460
Then did you break the
downstairs window glass?

405
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:54,562
That friend also broke that.

406
00:31:54,562 --> 00:31:59,367
I guess Yoo Si Jin who is the friend of the guy
who got discharged will pay for the repair cost.

407
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:02,704
As I told you, we aren't that close...

408
00:32:02,704 --> 00:32:06,308
Do you know what a hard time the Chairman
is giving me asking who broke that?

409
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,009
Where is the chairman?

410
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,679
Why is he wrecklessly holding
on to someone else's woman?

411
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:13,181
Because my boyfriend got admitted to the
hospital with the North Korean soldier.

412
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:14,649
Yes.

413
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:22,190
I'll be back in two hours, so finish
getting the IV and just wait.

414
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,327
Try running away somewhere...

415
00:32:27,329 --> 00:32:28,163
Hello.

416
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:38,870
So you use dissection
as your prenatal care.

417
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,375
You said you had a
week left, didn't you?

418
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:42,010
Yes. Next week.

419
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:45,080
Did you see Dr. Kang's boyfriend?
I heard he is handsome.

420
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:48,883
What good is being handsome? He was brought
in with a North Korean man shot by a gun.

421
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:51,353
I heard that North
Korean is also handsome.

422
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,855
Makes you wish unification
could happen soon.

423
00:32:56,825 --> 00:32:57,892
Hey!

424
00:33:01,196 --> 00:33:03,331
You should change you clothes
before wandering around.

425
00:33:03,698 --> 00:33:06,735
If you wear scrubs with a
belly as big as Namsan,

426
00:33:06,868 --> 00:33:08,269
Don't you think patients
will feel burdened?

427
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,638
Did your burdensome
surgical skills improve?

428
00:33:10,705 --> 00:33:15,744
Hey, always wear a gown. So people can
distinguish if you're a patient or a doctor.

429
00:33:16,011 --> 00:33:18,513
What? What did you just say now?

430
00:33:19,681 --> 00:33:21,750
AH! What are you doing?

431
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,756
My water broke. I think the
baby is about to come out.

432
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:29,858
Didn't you say you have one week left?

433
00:33:31,192 --> 00:33:33,762
Please page Dr. Jung from obstetrics
department. The baby is coming.

434
00:33:33,962 --> 00:33:35,697
Aren't you letting go of this?

435
00:33:35,964 --> 00:33:37,499
Hey, give pressure. Pressure.

436
00:33:37,699 --> 00:33:39,890
-Here?
-No put more pressure in your hand.

437
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,536
Hey! What are you saying?

438
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:42,904
Fighting!

439
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,160
The hospital administration?

440
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,047
Yes. I came here for
the window repair fee.

441
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,282
He said you were the guardian
of the patient, Yoo Si Jin.

442
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,810
Don't you think that patient doesn't
need any guardianship from anyone?

443
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,754
2 windows broke, the upper
floor and the lower floor.

444
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,457
Since this wreak didn't occur as
a result of a natural disaster,

445
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,390
someone must take responsibility
and pay for the damages.

446
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:06,094
Don't you think it isn't me?

447
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:09,164
The chairman told me to bill Dr. Kang.

448
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:12,767
I also think that is right.

449
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,536
Bite your molar teeth.

450
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,971
But why are you here?

451
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:21,130
The attending physician right below
Patient Yoo Si Jin's room is me.

452
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:23,340
The patient, Yoo Si Jin, didn't break
it. The North Korean soldier broke it.

453
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:25,313
But that North Korean soldier
got discharged to North Korea.

454
00:34:25,613 --> 00:34:27,715
-So you...
-Your molar teeth.

455
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,286
Wait a minute.

456
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:34,889
Hello.

457
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:36,624
The baby?

458
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:38,760
Already?

459
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:40,130
The baby is coming out now?

460
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:41,629
Yes. I will go there right away.

461
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,210
-I will leave first.
-Oh okay. Go. Go.

462
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,634
The baby is coming out. The
world is very beautiful, huh?

463
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,204
Hello! Dr. Kang! Doctor!

464
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:56,311
The South Joseon pushovers are talking about some
inter-Korea reunion of the displaced families.

465
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,448
They say that the future of the southeast
is dependent on the peace negotiations.

466
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:03,360
The wired fence is safer
the higher it is.

467
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:06,821
Between the South and the
North, the farther the better.

468
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:09,491
Go outside.

469
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:21,336
My thinking wasn't wrong.

470
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:31,112
To get what we want, it's threat rather than
conversation, anxiety rather than peace.

471
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,216
It's good to see your face again.

472
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:45,627
Neptune no. 51, I will give
a report on the mission.

473
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:51,432
I've carried out the punishment on Polaris no. 13
for his act of betrayal of a Republic's soldier.

474
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,638
I was able to verify the
voice that gave the orders.

475
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:58,907
I know.

476
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:04,412
I also heard that the
file was also secured.

477
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,917
Where is the file?

478
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:17,759
Seeing how quiet the Southern kids are,
it looks like nobody has cracked it.

479
00:36:18,326 --> 00:36:21,963
As trained, it should be doing
well somewhere inside your body.

480
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:41,382
The secret should be buried
together with the corpse.

481
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:44,786
If you have something to say
for the last time, say it.

482
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:51,993
On my memorial table, just put one
bowl of Pyongyang buckwheat noodles.

483
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:57,932
If possible, I'll ask for you to make
it Koryo Hotel's buckwheat noodles.

484
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,937
That isn't difficult to do.

485
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,742
It looks as if you have
nothing else to say.

486
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:12,013
Since the order is done, I would
also perform my last duty.

487
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:18,753
In the name of the republic, traitor
of the State Security Department,

488
00:37:19,053 --> 00:37:21,089
I will execute Director Choi Jung Ho.

489
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:05,667
What is this?

490
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,337
For the settlement on the reunion
meeting of the displaced families.

491
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:12,373
These are the preemptive
requirements sought by the Republic.

492
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:16,900
To my knowledge, we already have shown our
sincerity by letting Senior Lieutenant Ahn go.

493
00:38:16,978 --> 00:38:20,148
Don't people from the
South like to talk?

494
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,617
I'm saying we should keep talking.

495
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:27,355
Before the conditions listed are
settled, there is no negotiation.

496
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,759
The conditions listed here,

497
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:35,630
Whether we agree to the meeting of the separated
families or not, what does it matter?

498
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:38,733
Forget the North-South communication,

499
00:38:39,267 --> 00:38:43,004
I think that's what is written in here.
Am I right?

500
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:51,913
Good thing about communication about the North
and South is that we don't need interpreters.

501
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:57,719
Then, I will take it as I heard the
answer and will be going first.

502
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,790
Please sit for a moment.

503
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:08,529
I think you have to
look at this and leave.

504
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:16,337
It seems like you got some
dollars after selling your sons.

505
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,073
How much is it in here?

506
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,524
What are you doing?

507
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,728
There are orders to immediately send
Senior Lieutenant Ahn to Pyeongyang.

508
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,699
Senior Lieutenant Ahn is alive?

509
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:15,296
The secret was buried forever
with the traitor's corpse.

510
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:20,735
If possible, I ask that it be
Koryo Hotel's buckwheat noodles.

511
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:30,244
The password has been said.
The password is...

512
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:33,448
We have the GPS location
of the Goryo Hotel.

513
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:44,158
The skill of the South Korean
Special Forces is hopeless.

514
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:49,497
He shot me right where
it wouldn't kill me.

515
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:58,973
Come with us silently, Comrade.

516
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:03,811
I have the order to bring in your
corpse if you blabber nonsense.

517
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,981
Give me just two minutes.

518
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,750
We have time to eat a snack before I go.

519
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,689
For the cost of the cookie,

520
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:18,626
I should have it even as
I go to the next life.

521
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:21,963
Thanks to you...

522
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,966
I can go back to my country

523
00:41:26,434 --> 00:41:28,169
and I can die there as a soldier.

524
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,208
Thank you.

525
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:11,600
Chief Choi and his group canceled the
luncheon and left for Pyung Yang.

526
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:12,547
That's right.

527
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:17,985
But, is it okay to hand over the
original copy through a political trade?

528
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,488
Why? What's wrong with that?
We have many duplicates.

529
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:25,226
There is a person called General Park,
who is on bad terms with Chief Choi.

530
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,995
I shot him... an email.

531
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,531
South Korea is strong in IT.

532
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,335
Politics should be based on
the foundation of ethics.

533
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:37,104
The one who did bad should be punished.

534
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:39,840
Justice will prevail. Reward
virtue and punish evil.

535
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:44,145
Then, what about the ethics of keeping
the promise of a political agreement?

536
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:48,382
It seems like you have a long way to go... Hey,
does politics always work according to ethics?

537
00:42:50,785 --> 00:42:52,386
What time is the press conference?

538
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:55,256
I need to go choose a necktie.

539
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,759
She's coming. 10 meters.

540
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,697
Please hurry. 5 meters!

541
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:07,210
-I can't take my pants off because of the cast.
-Yeah then why did you get injured?

542
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:09,637
-Don't you know a perfect crime?
-1 meter.

543
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:11,439
Hurry.

544
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,149
Team Leader just fell asleep.

545
00:43:23,084 --> 00:43:24,685
It's good if he sleeps a lot.

546
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,990
But... you didn't just come in
after going somewhere, right?

547
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:31,158
Oh, how could that be.

548
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:33,327
I'll come again when he wakes up.

549
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,638
Wow, that...

550
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,850
Why did you have to go
and get hurt again?

551
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,579
I didn't get hurt because I wanted...

552
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:58,853
Team Leader has just fallen asleep.

553
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:01,122
That's right.

554
00:44:02,289 --> 00:44:05,059
You're going through a lot of trouble
being at Sergeant Seo's bedside.

555
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:12,166
I forgot I'm at a disadvantage
trusting people like this.

556
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:15,302
But why are you here?

557
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:31,619
Perfect crime?

558
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:34,570
What are you going to do about
the cost of the windows?

559
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:38,550
I have a good idea. How about
we go halves like a man.

560
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,960
Oh, that. Great idea.

561
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:45,066
-I'm saying I'm bedridden.
-I'm saying I'm not manly.

562
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:56,010
What are you doing here?

563
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:59,847
Long time no see.
You've been well right?

564
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:04,218
I see a variety of things everyday.
Are you here to visit Captain Yoo?

565
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:06,370
Yes. He didn't die right?

566
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:09,523
Not yet. Although he's
about to by my hands.

567
00:45:10,324 --> 00:45:12,610
Go up! Master Sergeant
Seo is also with him.

568
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:15,529
I saw Sergeant Seo's car
in the parking lot.

569
00:45:16,363 --> 00:45:18,165
-That's why.
-What do you mean that's why?

570
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:21,202
-Did you fight with Master Sergeant Seo?
-No.

571
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,506
We broke up. He is now someone
who has nothing to do with me.

572
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:27,641
Really? Why? When?

573
00:45:29,110 --> 00:45:31,345
-Well.
-Why is the conclusion like that?

574
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:35,049
I understand.

575
00:45:35,616 --> 00:45:37,685
They are Dumb and Dumber.

576
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:41,655
The country better not find
out those men are like that.

577
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:44,391
Master Sergeant Seo wasn't
hurt anywhere, right?

578
00:45:46,227 --> 00:45:48,195
You said he's someone who
has nothing to do with you.

579
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:52,767
I was just asking as a doctor.
Then I'm going.

580
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,707
Their love life, too.

581
00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:10,651
Am I the only one
suffocating in this room?

582
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:17,330
If you're here for a hospital visit, then can
you show a little concern for the patient?

583
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:20,494
Your girlfriend who's worrying a lot
is outside. Should I call for her?

584
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:24,310
No. She already worried a lot and left.

585
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:28,269
You look pretty fine
so, I will leave now.

586
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,471
Hey,

587
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:34,475
You could have come empty-handed with our
relationship. Buying such an energizing gift.

588
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:37,344
If she brought such a gift,
at least offer her a chair.

589
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:40,047
-I'll let you two speak.
-I'm going.

590
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,930
-I will leave.
-I said I will leave.

591
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:45,786
If the two of you leave,
then who'll stay with me?

592
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,090
It would have been better if he
was lying there instead of you.

593
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:53,093
Oh, he did lie down here
briefly in my place earlier.

594
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:56,630
You didn't know, right? Master
Sergeant Seo is really elegant.

595
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:00,267
Hey, earlier he was fixing
his hair by his ear.

596
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:02,469
You keep joking around...

597
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:05,406
Oh, this face! Exactly this face!

598
00:47:05,673 --> 00:47:08,008
He was pushing his hair back
behind his ear, saying, "Oh my!"

599
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,610
I didn't say, "Oh my."

600
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:14,081
You are Dumb and Dumber.
Take care of yourself.

601
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:18,485
Ay, you idiot!

602
00:47:20,487 --> 00:47:22,523
I did the best I could to help.

603
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:25,092
I stopped you because it seemed like it.

604
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:26,927
It isn't going to
be resolved this way?

605
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:31,665
Just what was it? Why did you break up?

606
00:47:32,032 --> 00:47:34,935
I... filed for a discharge.

607
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:39,940
-What did you say?
-A choice that I could do...

608
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:41,709
it was just that.

609
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:46,780
Do what?

610
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:52,019
I'm sorry.

611
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,757
How could you decide this by yourself...

612
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:01,295
I am really upset.

613
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:03,797
I am sorry.

614
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,699
Does the Commander know this, too?

615
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,803
Myung Ju was also there
when I saw the Commander.

616
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:18,579
Quickly go and hold onto her. She's
a woman you risked your life for.

617
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:21,815
Don't wait make her wait too long.

618
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,807
What do you think happened
between those two?

619
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:22,009
From what I can tell...

620
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:28,582
The two of them are fighting, but 1st Lt.
Yoon is breaking up. For Sergeant Seo's sake.

621
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:31,618
That's why he can't go find 1st Lt. Yoon.

622
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:37,157
Because 1st Lt. Yoon is a good woman.

623
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:41,795
From what I can tell...

624
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:45,733
Sergeant Seo knows where 1st Lt.
Yoon is hiding.

625
00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:49,570
He wants to hold onto her but he doesn't.

626
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:53,707
For the sake of 1st Lt. Yoon's pride
as she's trying hard to hide.

627
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:00,347
Because Sergeant First
Class Seo is a good man.

628
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:03,117
What are you doing this evening?

629
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:05,252
If nothing special,
come shopping with me.

630
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:06,720
What are you buying?

631
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:09,390
You were talking about car shopping?

632
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,291
I told you I was going to get a new
car when I come back to Korea.

633
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:14,110
What the use of saving money when you might
just die from an earthquake someday?

634
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:17,498
I'm going to die after spending all of it. I'm going
to spend it for myself without leaving any behind.

635
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:20,000
What if you don't die
after spending all?

636
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:22,980
Although I did not think about
that, I'm going to get a new car.

637
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:24,038
Pick and choose.

638
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:26,006
What do you like?

639
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:31,045
I like this one.

640
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:34,314
Hey, you just interfered in my life.
Why did you interfere? Do you like me?

641
00:50:35,149 --> 00:50:37,140
The salesman recommended
this one earlier, too.

642
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:39,553
Hey, you just looked at me closely. Why did
you look at me closely? Do you like me?

643
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:42,222
Hey, you just liked me. Why did
you like me? Do you like... What?

644
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:43,991
What did you say? What? What?

645
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:45,025
Oh wow.

646
00:50:45,190 --> 00:50:47,027
Hurry up and sign. I'm hungry.

647
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:50,764
Please bring me a contract. Quickly.

648
00:50:55,870 --> 00:51:01,108
The South and North Koreas decided to hold the
family reunion for 100 families next month.

649
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:05,160
During yesterday's South-North
Summit held at the Panmunjum,

650
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:08,148
they agreed and proceeded with
producing a signed agreement.

651
00:51:08,470 --> 00:51:13,821
As a result, the family reunion which was
interrupted will be held first time in five years.

652
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:19,093
The two Koreas will meet soon
to figure out the details.

653
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:29,230
Successful South-North Summit.
Agreement on Family Reunion.

654
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:46,250
Don't get nervous. I'm here
because I'm off my work.

655
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:47,454
You're not going home?

656
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:49,957
Because I'm your guardian until tonight.

657
00:51:52,570 --> 00:51:54,061
When will I get discharged?

658
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:55,696
Can I stay here for like a week?

659
00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:00,030
I really like seeing your face every
two hours because of your rounds.

660
00:52:00,167 --> 00:52:02,369
You really liked it, but
you still went out?

661
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:05,472
Where did you go earlier?

662
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:07,290
At the rooftop. I needed some air.

663
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:08,475
I did check the rooftop.

664
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,678
I did not say it was the
rooftop of this building...

665
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:16,583
Did you go to the
department store again?

666
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:22,990
With your friend?

667
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:28,095
But why did you come back alone?

668
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:32,733
Because we had different
paths to follow.

669
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:41,308
I'm not feeling very well. Can you
console me instead of scolding me?

670
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:43,977
Why aren't you feeling well?

671
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:51,919
I protected the peace in the Korean peninsula but
it is a night of uncertainty for my friend's life.

672
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:57,958
And your girlfriend is
worrying about you.

673
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:06,833
Have you ever laid in a patient's bed?

674
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:10,404
Climb in here.

675
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:14,975
How can she refuse it?

676
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:18,645
Why are being so hard on me?

677
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:22,380
I am a patient afterall. It's not
like I can do something to you.

678
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:25,018
A patient did go to
the department store.

679
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:28,088
A doctor should protect herself.

680
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:29,690
What are you talking about?

681
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:32,626
I don't know. I'm sleepy.

682
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:45,005
Doctor Lee Chi Hoon became
a dad around noon today.

683
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,441
It's a boy.

684
00:53:48,910 --> 00:53:51,712
Take it into consideration if you're
going to prepare a gift for them.

685
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,781
He should be cute like his dad.

686
00:53:56,690 --> 00:53:58,151
Please send him my congratulations.

687
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:01,488
Transmission received.

688
00:54:02,850 --> 00:54:04,324
I'm sorry

689
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:07,027
for making you worry.

690
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:13,267
Thank you for saving my life.

691
00:54:21,850 --> 00:54:26,313
Why are we always being thankful to each
other for saving each other's life?

692
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:33,320
Other couples are being thankful
for giving them a ride home,

693
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:38,492
thankful for celebrating
anniversary, or something like that.

694
00:54:41,170 --> 00:54:43,463
-I'm sorry.
-Is that true?

695
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:46,833
What do you mean?

696
00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:54,107
I saw what kind of peace you
brought today on the news.

697
00:54:56,130 --> 00:55:00,380
But if you really are sorry for me,

698
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:07,187
don't ever show up covered in blood.

699
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:12,426
I beg you.

700
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:16,363
Transmission received.

701
00:55:21,770 --> 00:55:24,371
Do you want to watch a movie? The one
that we didn't get to see before.

702
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,173
Here?

703
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:30,477
They have those cool
things in the VIP rooms.

704
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:35,415
And something cool like this one, too.

705
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:41,822
Wow, we get to see this movie this way.

706
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,890
I couldn't even think of it.

707
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,259
We finally made it to the play button.

708
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,862
Last time, it stopped at the payment.

709
00:55:58,490 --> 00:56:02,242
We didn't know who fell asleep first.

710
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:09,383
It was a long and tiring
day, and I was in his arms.

711
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:14,888
Lying there, I sparked all night long.

712
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,891
Like a woman being loved.

713
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:27,934
I wonder if the movie we didn't get to
see had a happy ending or a sad ending.

714
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:55,429
Didn't you say you were going to shower?
You're wearing your clothes.

715
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,680
Let me watch you filling the
bathtub with water, first.

716
00:56:57,690 --> 00:56:59,699
-Don't even think about it.
-By the way, did you know?

717
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:02,169
We never said, "I love
you," to each other.

718
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:04,070
We did say with our bodies.

719
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:06,606
I would like to send you
also for this mission.

720
00:57:06,910 --> 00:57:11,344
Or there is an option for me to
sign your discharge request.

721
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:13,580
-What do you want me to do?
-I would like to go.

722
00:57:13,950 --> 00:57:16,716
I will come back when
the seasons change.

723
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,686
First Sergeant Class Seo
returned, didn't he?

724
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:22,289
Anyway, what brings you
here, Staff Sergeant Choi?
