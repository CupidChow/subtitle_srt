1
00:00:01,575 --> 00:00:04,442
Mic test. Check one, two.

2
00:00:04,527 --> 00:00:05,970
Check one, two, three.

3
00:00:07,075 --> 00:00:09,491
You really did fix it after all.

4
00:00:09,692 --> 00:00:10,973
This is how I treat my patients.

5
00:00:11,058 --> 00:00:12,562
Music changes a lot of things.

6
00:00:12,704 --> 00:00:14,464
I will make the song selection then.

7
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:15,442
That's fine by me.

8
00:00:24,718 --> 00:00:26,627
"Episode 9"

9
00:01:06,863 --> 00:01:08,949
If I had known that I would
die in a foreign country,

10
00:01:09,113 --> 00:01:11,726
I would have lived a carefree life instead
of focusing on becoming a professor.

11
00:01:12,045 --> 00:01:14,625
I should have had fun,
spending as much money as I could.

12
00:01:18,193 --> 00:01:19,359
No.

13
00:01:20,005 --> 00:01:23,027
I can't leave that as my dying message.

14
00:01:29,013 --> 00:01:31,194
Yoo Shijin, are you on your way?

15
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:34,815
You're not coming.
I don't think you're coming.

16
00:01:35,144 --> 00:01:37,995
I don't think I can hold out
till you get here.

17
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:40,804
Even so,

18
00:01:41,153 --> 00:01:45,351
you would be the first
to find me if I die.

19
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,836
If I had known would die like this,

20
00:01:53,921 --> 00:01:58,794
I should have confessed
my true feelings to you.

21
00:01:59,826 --> 00:02:02,977
I got kissed by an amazing man.

22
00:02:03,361 --> 00:02:05,888
My heart flutters whenever
I thought about that.

23
00:02:21,358 --> 00:02:23,624
Music really changes a lot of things.

24
00:02:25,828 --> 00:02:28,829
I think I am at the center of that change.

25
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:37,494
Oh my goodness. How embarrassing.

26
00:02:42,718 --> 00:02:44,802
Oh, my. You startled me.

27
00:02:46,013 --> 00:02:47,364
How did you get here?

28
00:02:47,449 --> 00:02:48,643
Why are you here?

29
00:02:49,063 --> 00:02:50,547
I have advantage in things like this.

30
00:02:50,632 --> 00:02:52,818
Are you using your training
as Special Forces...

31
00:02:52,918 --> 00:02:54,139
...on a matter like this?

32
00:02:54,224 --> 00:02:55,214
For personal reasons?

33
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:57,500
Well, someone was publicly
broadcasting her feelings.

34
00:02:57,585 --> 00:02:59,068
There needs to be a doctor
that broadcasts.

35
00:02:59,168 --> 00:03:00,794
You said so yourself.

36
00:03:00,996 --> 00:03:04,018
This is really ridiculous. Why did you
listen to someone else's recording?

37
00:03:04,103 --> 00:03:05,424
I didn't intend to, but it was playing.

38
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:08,160
Just because it was playing,
how could you just listen to it

39
00:03:09,955 --> 00:03:11,792
You're really cute
when you're caught off guard.

40
00:03:12,074 --> 00:03:13,354
But why are you running away?

41
00:03:14,145 --> 00:03:16,194
When you were near to death,
you had the heart to confess.

42
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,974
But now that you're alive,
have you changed your mind?

43
00:03:19,358 --> 00:03:21,376
Confess? I wasn't confessing my feelings.

44
00:03:21,461 --> 00:03:22,817
That voice was definitely yours.

45
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:23,818
It wasn't me.

46
00:03:23,918 --> 00:03:25,251
This phone belongs to you.

47
00:03:25,336 --> 00:03:26,408
This isn't a phone...

48
00:03:26,493 --> 00:03:29,618
Goodness. What am I saying?
Just keep quiet, Kang Moyeon.

49
00:03:30,358 --> 00:03:32,078
It's an honor to be in your will.

50
00:03:32,163 --> 00:03:33,300
Sure. Whatever.

51
00:03:34,118 --> 00:03:35,420
Hold on a second.

52
00:03:35,554 --> 00:03:36,562
Look!

53
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:38,333
I'm not fooled.

54
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:41,485
Stop rejecting me. Do you know
how many times you've rejected me?

55
00:03:43,405 --> 00:03:46,110
I have to hear from you if it was
a confession of your feelings or not.

56
00:03:46,676 --> 00:03:47,947
So stop running away.

57
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:52,152
All right.

58
00:03:53,198 --> 00:03:54,796
I'll tell you.

59
00:03:55,214 --> 00:03:56,803
So let go of me.

60
00:03:58,511 --> 00:03:59,490
I really will.

61
00:03:59,575 --> 00:04:00,720
For real?

62
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:15,064
They say flowers bloom
even during the war.

63
00:04:15,306 --> 00:04:17,269
I guess after earthquakes,
relationships will blossom.

64
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:21,518
People are even confessing their
feelings and kissing at this place.

65
00:04:22,283 --> 00:04:24,529
Others are busy living
their lives like that.

66
00:04:24,614 --> 00:04:26,334
Shouldn't we be diligent like them?

67
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:28,073
Working, but also kissing in between?

68
00:04:28,626 --> 00:04:30,121
You're messing around a lot these days.

69
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,472
Even after experiencing such a disaster,

70
00:04:33,557 --> 00:04:35,827
haven't you realised that we need
to mess around whilst we can?

71
00:04:35,912 --> 00:04:37,191
Shut up.

72
00:04:38,352 --> 00:04:41,500
So you still remember my will, right?

73
00:04:41,653 --> 00:04:44,555
-The secret folder, 1030.
-Get rid of it this instant.

74
00:04:44,898 --> 00:04:46,368
What has that folder done to you?

75
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,399
Does the secret folder
know what it contains?

76
00:04:48,953 --> 00:04:50,602
Poor secret folder.

77
00:04:52,283 --> 00:04:54,335
Why is she worried about the folder?

78
00:04:57,545 --> 00:04:59,992
See? I was right.

79
00:05:02,683 --> 00:05:06,227
Then do we need to call Doctor
Kang our sister-in-law?

80
00:05:06,312 --> 00:05:10,145
What are you talking about?
They need to get married first.

81
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:12,369
You need to learn
how to follow the standard practice.

82
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:15,142
Personally,

83
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:16,828
I don't like Doctor Kang.

84
00:05:17,386 --> 00:05:18,649
Why is that?

85
00:05:18,837 --> 00:05:20,885
She's a well-paid doctor
and she's also pretty.

86
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,098
What's not to like about her?

87
00:05:22,183 --> 00:05:23,981
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

88
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:27,518
Why would a well-paid and pretty
woman go out with a soldier?

89
00:05:27,603 --> 00:05:28,718
Is she doing charity work?

90
00:05:29,812 --> 00:05:31,260
She's just attracted to him
since she's far away from home.

91
00:05:31,345 --> 00:05:33,613
You never know
when she'll change her mind.

92
00:05:33,698 --> 00:05:35,412
Imagine if she finds out about what we do.

93
00:05:35,637 --> 00:05:38,021
Isn't it obvious she'll tell him
to transfer to some other troop...

94
00:05:38,336 --> 00:05:39,564
...or to leave the army?

95
00:05:43,903 --> 00:05:47,019
You guys just don't get it.
This is frustrating.

96
00:05:47,383 --> 00:05:48,774
Oh, I get it.

97
00:05:49,757 --> 00:05:52,350
What is Sergeant Choi's wife like?

98
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,956
She's exactly like Doctor Kang.

99
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,365
She makes good money from running
a store and she is really pretty.

100
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:57,399
I see.

101
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:59,095
What's wrong with him?

102
00:05:59,717 --> 00:06:02,516
But Sergeant Choi didn't give us
20,000 won before he left.

103
00:06:02,601 --> 00:06:05,586
My goodness. Sir, wait up!

104
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:06,791
Catch him.

105
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:15,792
Nurse Ha, make the list of
medical supplies we need by tonight,

106
00:06:15,877 --> 00:06:17,399
and send it to the hospital.

107
00:06:17,483 --> 00:06:18,898
To sum up,

108
00:06:18,983 --> 00:06:21,903
is it right that you confessed
your love to Captain Yoo?

109
00:06:21,988 --> 00:06:25,599
It seems Captain Yoo confessed
his love to her first.

110
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:27,683
-She's right.
-I guess so.

111
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:31,640
You are well educated people.
Please gossip about it behind my back.

112
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,457
Okay, then. Focus.

113
00:06:35,086 --> 00:06:36,700
For those who are leaving tomorrow...

114
00:06:36,785 --> 00:06:38,239
So is today the start
of your relationship?

115
00:06:38,324 --> 00:06:39,293
It'll start tomorrow.

116
00:06:39,378 --> 00:06:42,061
No, normally, it starts on the day.

117
00:06:42,146 --> 00:06:43,054
-Really?
-Yes.

118
00:06:43,154 --> 00:06:45,015
Just stop talking about it.

119
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,836
Those who started dating from today...

120
00:06:47,936 --> 00:06:48,790
Gosh...

121
00:06:50,732 --> 00:06:52,232
It's their first day today.

122
00:06:52,595 --> 00:06:54,965
Can't  all of you just go back to Korea?

123
00:07:09,237 --> 00:07:10,880
I will check your blood pressure.

124
00:07:13,743 --> 00:07:14,987
Excuse me, Doctor.

125
00:07:15,974 --> 00:07:17,948
I don't want to be treated by him.

126
00:07:18,851 --> 00:07:19,709
Why?

127
00:07:20,076 --> 00:07:22,154
He is the one who found you first.

128
00:07:22,254 --> 00:07:23,974
That's what I'm saying.

129
00:07:24,489 --> 00:07:27,765
It drives me crazy whenever
I recall that moment.

130
00:07:28,409 --> 00:07:30,174
And his hands are trembling.

131
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:35,201
Okay, then.

132
00:07:35,953 --> 00:07:37,092
Who should be treating you?

133
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:38,807
I know, Schweitzer.

134
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:39,991
What about Schweitzer?

135
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:41,401
But you don't speak English.

136
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,578
Or Jang Joonhyuk?

137
00:07:43,901 --> 00:07:45,478
But he's dead.

138
00:07:45,797 --> 00:07:46,645
What should we do?

139
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:48,210
We have no other doctors available.

140
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:53,125
Your doctor is not a TV channel.

141
00:07:53,615 --> 00:07:56,786
You can't switch it whenever you want.

142
00:07:57,489 --> 00:07:59,065
Let him treat you if you want to recover.

143
00:08:00,654 --> 00:08:02,343
Keep treating him
so that he'll get better.

144
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:07,660
It is 120 over 80.

145
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,311
Everything is fine.

146
00:08:28,617 --> 00:08:29,674
Oh my gosh.

147
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,257
What are you doing?

148
00:08:54,484 --> 00:08:55,425
I'm not doing anything.

149
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,654
You clearly were.

150
00:08:57,174 --> 00:09:00,038
You looked as if you're avoiding people
because you're embarrassed.

151
00:09:00,485 --> 00:09:01,864
Just continue on your way.

152
00:09:01,949 --> 00:09:03,353
You sure have guts.

153
00:09:03,438 --> 00:09:06,620
How can you think about dating
the Special Forces Alpha Team captain?

154
00:09:10,154 --> 00:09:11,296
Lieutenant Yoon.

155
00:09:11,654 --> 00:09:12,941
Let me ask you a question.

156
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,262
Go ahead.

157
00:09:14,745 --> 00:09:16,419
Don't get all serious on me, though.

158
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:18,918
This is a military zone and I'm in charge.

159
00:09:19,654 --> 00:09:21,089
Doesn't it bother you...

160
00:09:21,805 --> 00:09:24,816
...that your boyfriend is a soldier?

161
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:27,935
Aren't you afraid...

162
00:09:28,254 --> 00:09:29,663
...that he'd get hurt or disappeared?

163
00:09:30,701 --> 00:09:32,064
As far as I know,

164
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:36,154
Sergeant Major Seo's job
is as dangerous as Captain Yoo's.

165
00:09:37,036 --> 00:09:38,077
To be precise,

166
00:09:38,162 --> 00:09:42,104
they penetrate into the enemy territory
using various land, water and air routes,

167
00:09:42,189 --> 00:09:45,595
to reconnaissance guerrilla warfare,
gather intelligence, rescue hostages,

168
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,490
destroy key military facilities,
and induce surrender,

169
00:09:47,575 --> 00:09:49,243
at the risk of their lives.

170
00:09:52,644 --> 00:09:54,757
But I'm not worried about his job.

171
00:09:55,521 --> 00:09:57,771
I'm just afraid to be away from him.

172
00:09:59,196 --> 00:10:02,044
That is why I'm not worried about anything
since we are together now.

173
00:10:02,574 --> 00:10:04,746
Simply put, I'm blinded by love.

174
00:10:05,717 --> 00:10:06,842
That's how I feel.

175
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,715
What are you doing here alone?

176
00:10:40,254 --> 00:10:42,245
I'm agonizing over something.

177
00:10:43,054 --> 00:10:44,040
By the way,

178
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,607
can I ask you a question?

179
00:10:47,685 --> 00:10:50,247
Doesn't it bother you
that your boyfriend is a soldier?

180
00:10:50,381 --> 00:10:52,411
Why are you all asking
that question to me?

181
00:10:52,511 --> 00:10:54,630
You should go talk to her.

182
00:10:55,215 --> 00:10:57,444
Moyeon just asked me the same question.

183
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,154
What did you tell her?

184
00:11:01,254 --> 00:11:03,012
Hear it from her yourself.

185
00:11:03,122 --> 00:11:06,719
This is not an information warfare.
You should talk face-to-face.

186
00:11:07,754 --> 00:11:09,123
You're not the one to talk.

187
00:11:09,863 --> 00:11:11,801
It's always a hand-to-hand combat for me.

188
00:11:14,254 --> 00:11:15,278
What is this for?

189
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:17,505
Who are you going to throw it at?

190
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,343
I was thinking about that.
Give it back.

191
00:11:20,624 --> 00:11:22,082
Come take it from me.

192
00:11:22,254 --> 00:11:23,700
Don't do anything you'll regret.

193
00:11:23,785 --> 00:11:24,897
Can't you take it from me?

194
00:11:34,617 --> 00:11:36,774
I told you, you'd regret it.

195
00:11:37,254 --> 00:11:39,144
You two look very friendly.

196
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,806
What are you saying?

197
00:11:41,484 --> 00:11:42,924
Can't I be friendly with another man?

198
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:44,554
Are you still upset with me?

199
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:46,083
How can I not be upset?

200
00:11:46,258 --> 00:11:49,069
It's not like I asked for it three
times a day after each meal.

201
00:11:49,154 --> 00:11:52,131
How could you run away when I only
asked to do in when no one's watching?

202
00:11:52,731 --> 00:11:54,885
Just go do roll calls for
the rest of your life.

203
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:56,499
I see.

204
00:12:00,074 --> 00:12:00,958
You asked him for that?

205
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,559
The thing between a man and a woman?

206
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:04,904
Is that it?

207
00:12:06,031 --> 00:12:07,263
It's not that.

208
00:12:08,522 --> 00:12:10,895
I just asked him to hold
my hand and give me a hug.

209
00:12:11,473 --> 00:12:12,745
That's all I wanted.

210
00:12:13,135 --> 00:12:14,468
But he's like this all the time.

211
00:12:15,094 --> 00:12:18,746
He never holds my hand.
He just holds my arm or shoulder.

212
00:12:19,749 --> 00:12:20,872
Idiot.

213
00:12:24,524 --> 00:12:25,415
It's him.

214
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,323
Please throw it at him.

215
00:12:31,827 --> 00:12:32,979
Idiot.

216
00:12:33,429 --> 00:12:35,636
Stop it. I don't know what I'll do
if you keep doing that.

217
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:36,767
What are you going to do?

218
00:12:37,547 --> 00:12:38,970
Are you going to hold my shoulder, too?

219
00:12:39,643 --> 00:12:41,561
Gosh, you consistent person.

220
00:12:43,506 --> 00:12:45,010
What an idiot.

221
00:12:45,576 --> 00:12:46,437
My goodness.

222
00:12:54,954 --> 00:12:55,807
-Four.
-Four.

223
00:12:56,288 --> 00:12:58,196
-One, two, three, four.
-One, two, three, four.

224
00:12:58,281 --> 00:13:01,269
I'm so glad to see that scene again.

225
00:13:01,685 --> 00:13:03,674
It feels like our life's back to normal.

226
00:13:04,282 --> 00:13:06,701
It's nice that the sign
of a normal life is...

227
00:13:07,316 --> 00:13:08,670
...watching half-naked men running.

228
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:10,834
-Two, three, four.
-Two, three, four.

229
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:12,624
-They are a symbol of peace.
-One, two, three, four.

230
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,252
-One, two, three, four.
-One, two, three, four.

231
00:13:14,337 --> 00:13:15,934
They are like the white doves of Urk.

232
00:13:18,146 --> 00:13:19,010
-Four.
-Four.

233
00:13:19,624 --> 00:13:22,574
Didn't you say you have a meeting
at the UN Camp?

234
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,511
Aren't you running late?

235
00:13:24,882 --> 00:13:26,176
I'll just be late.

236
00:13:28,496 --> 00:13:29,469
Captain Yoo!

237
00:13:29,554 --> 00:13:30,808
Hello.

238
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,334
-One, two, three, four.
-One, two, three, four.

239
00:13:34,419 --> 00:13:35,770
-One, two, three, four.
-One, two, three, four.

240
00:13:35,854 --> 00:13:37,459
-One, two...
-What are you doing?

241
00:13:40,606 --> 00:13:41,454
One.

242
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:43,194
-Two.
-Two.

243
00:13:43,554 --> 00:13:44,393
-Three.
-Three.

244
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:45,983
-Four.
-Four.

245
00:13:46,354 --> 00:13:47,826
She's so easy to fool.

246
00:13:48,438 --> 00:13:50,922
Maybe they did more than
just kiss each other.

247
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:52,883
Nurse Choi.

248
00:13:54,008 --> 00:13:56,069
-Yes?
-Is it true that...

249
00:13:56,154 --> 00:13:57,330
...people kiss...

250
00:13:58,569 --> 00:14:00,455
...in between work?

251
00:14:01,381 --> 00:14:02,215
What?

252
00:14:10,154 --> 00:14:10,999
Oh my god!

253
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:13,629
You startled me.

254
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:15,782
What are you doing here?

255
00:14:16,321 --> 00:14:17,866
How are you here again?

256
00:14:18,127 --> 00:14:19,820
I've been here the whole time.

257
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,588
-Are people teasing you?
-This is all because of...

258
00:14:28,695 --> 00:14:30,110
I'm busy.

259
00:14:30,272 --> 00:14:32,300
I have a meeting to attend. Goodbye.

260
00:14:33,054 --> 00:14:34,618
I need to go to the same meeting.

261
00:14:35,002 --> 00:14:36,998
I think you just met someone
who can give you a ride.

262
00:14:37,322 --> 00:14:39,682
-I'll go by myself.
-And run into danger again?

263
00:14:39,858 --> 00:14:41,420
I'll let you know if that happens.

264
00:14:42,554 --> 00:14:44,357
Why are you always avoiding me?

265
00:14:45,355 --> 00:14:46,811
You avoided me when I confessed.

266
00:14:47,126 --> 00:14:49,069
And now you're avoiding me
after including me in your will.

267
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:50,069
It wasn't a will.

268
00:14:50,154 --> 00:14:51,127
You said your heart was
fluttering the whole time.

269
00:14:51,212 --> 00:14:52,380
That wasn't me.

270
00:14:54,385 --> 00:14:56,871
I'm not asking you to tell me
about your true feelings.

271
00:15:02,554 --> 00:15:05,143
Don't feel embarrassed just because
I found out that you like me.

272
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:06,885
Even so,

273
00:15:07,693 --> 00:15:09,297
it doesn't change the fact
that I like you more.

274
00:15:13,361 --> 00:15:14,213
By the way,

275
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:18,053
you look pretty today.

276
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,279
Stop it.

277
00:15:25,554 --> 00:15:27,141
I will see you at the main gate
in 10 minutes.

278
00:15:48,433 --> 00:15:50,757
Which of the following is not
the persuader's logic?

279
00:15:50,842 --> 00:15:54,173
Number 1. You can persuade 20 million
people who are opposing it.

280
00:15:54,258 --> 00:15:57,079
Number 2. Find a country
better than yours...

281
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,946
Are you taking a qualification exam?

282
00:15:59,517 --> 00:16:02,343
Yes. As a man, I want to have
a high school diploma.

283
00:16:02,856 --> 00:16:05,558
By the way, you're a nurse,
but you do acupuncture, too.

284
00:16:05,643 --> 00:16:07,014
Did you study oriental medicine?

285
00:16:07,454 --> 00:16:08,777
I didn't go to college,

286
00:16:08,862 --> 00:16:11,869
but my dad was an oriental doctor
and I'm roughly copying what he did.

287
00:16:11,954 --> 00:16:14,509
Are you saying you don't have a license?

288
00:16:14,594 --> 00:16:16,033
I guess I am.

289
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:18,468
Then I'll call it a day. Thanks.

290
00:16:18,553 --> 00:16:21,202
Stay still or you'll pull
a whole load of muscles.

291
00:16:21,287 --> 00:16:22,580
Yes, Miss.

292
00:16:25,534 --> 00:16:27,529
Where are you from?

293
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:30,067
Your accent is a little
different than ours.

294
00:16:30,938 --> 00:16:32,032
I'm of Goryeo descent.

295
00:16:32,766 --> 00:16:33,606
Goryeo?

296
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:35,521
Wait, Goryeo?

297
00:16:36,054 --> 00:16:37,869
Isn't that a really old country?

298
00:16:37,954 --> 00:16:40,189
It appears in historical dramas a lot.

299
00:16:40,274 --> 00:16:42,710
How are you still alive?

300
00:16:45,752 --> 00:16:47,277
You'll never pass your test.

301
00:16:50,154 --> 00:16:52,439
I expected the UN meeting
would be very strict.

302
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,004
But everyone's so pleasant.

303
00:16:54,424 --> 00:16:56,803
They meet only during emergencies.

304
00:16:57,154 --> 00:16:58,564
So humor is a must.

305
00:16:58,854 --> 00:17:00,726
I see. That's why.

306
00:17:02,213 --> 00:17:03,738
You're like that, too.

307
00:17:03,954 --> 00:17:05,788
You joke at the worst times.

308
00:17:05,873 --> 00:17:09,013
Being serious when it's
serious only makes it worse.

309
00:17:12,154 --> 00:17:14,884
How does it feel to do
something that must be done?

310
00:17:15,254 --> 00:17:16,464
Are you proud?

311
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:18,038
It's impossible to find a date.

312
00:17:19,356 --> 00:17:20,389
I see.

313
00:17:23,598 --> 00:17:24,828
Speaking of,

314
00:17:25,746 --> 00:17:27,821
how many boyfriends have you had?

315
00:17:29,064 --> 00:17:30,754
Why do men ask that?

316
00:17:30,859 --> 00:17:32,988
Who else asked you that?

317
00:17:33,954 --> 00:17:34,956
Let's see.

318
00:17:49,154 --> 00:17:51,235
-What was that?
-I'll go and check.

319
00:17:51,562 --> 00:17:52,935
Sit very still.

320
00:18:10,912 --> 00:18:12,274
Why? What is it?

321
00:18:12,594 --> 00:18:15,446
If I'm right, it's an anti-personnel mine.

322
00:18:15,854 --> 00:18:17,289
What? A landmine?

323
00:18:27,866 --> 00:18:30,668
Is it a real mine? Did we drive over one?

324
00:18:30,922 --> 00:18:31,818
Yes.

325
00:18:32,724 --> 00:18:36,063
It seems like the earthquake
moved them about a bit.

326
00:18:36,154 --> 00:18:37,837
Don't ever move by yourself.

327
00:18:39,754 --> 00:18:41,785
We're in the middle of a minefield.

328
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,172
What should we do?

329
00:18:47,402 --> 00:18:49,005
My phone's not working either.

330
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:54,971
Neither does the radio.

331
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,459
Give me your bag.

332
00:19:01,524 --> 00:19:02,554
What will you do?

333
00:19:02,639 --> 00:19:04,966
Shouldn't we wait for help?

334
00:19:07,362 --> 00:19:08,421
Take these.

335
00:19:12,287 --> 00:19:13,174
Come out.

336
00:19:18,654 --> 00:19:20,750
We're going to get out of here.

337
00:19:21,254 --> 00:19:22,837
Aren't we surrounded by mines? So how?

338
00:19:22,922 --> 00:19:24,862
Step exactly where I stepped.

339
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:28,430
I won't let you die, so don't be scared.

340
00:19:39,192 --> 00:19:42,279
What really happens if you step on a mine?

341
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,217
There's nothing you can do.

342
00:19:46,354 --> 00:19:49,099
Unlike in movies,
if you step on it, it goes off.

343
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:50,594
Okay.

344
00:19:52,064 --> 00:19:53,065
You have to step right here.

345
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:54,977
It's quite a jump.

346
00:19:55,354 --> 00:19:56,295
Can you manage?

347
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:57,612
Hold my hand.

348
00:20:05,394 --> 00:20:06,327
How was that?

349
00:20:06,954 --> 00:20:07,850
Not bad.

350
00:20:09,796 --> 00:20:10,652
Keep it up.

351
00:20:10,737 --> 00:20:11,791
You, too.

352
00:20:18,854 --> 00:20:20,097
Is that a mine?

353
00:20:20,227 --> 00:20:23,880
Yes. It's an M16-A1 anti-personnel mine.

354
00:20:24,935 --> 00:20:26,932
Do you have the flags I gave you?

355
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,835
Here you go.

356
00:20:33,064 --> 00:20:35,061
The only way to beat a minefield...

357
00:20:35,324 --> 00:20:36,739
...is to go slow.

358
00:20:37,594 --> 00:20:38,723
Try to relax.

359
00:20:39,535 --> 00:20:41,271
And enjoy the sexy view.

360
00:20:43,101 --> 00:20:44,628
This must be that time...

361
00:20:45,121 --> 00:20:46,894
...when a joke gives you courage.

362
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:51,961
The joke was me telling you to relax.

363
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:53,380
The rest is a fact.

364
00:20:53,724 --> 00:20:55,307
You're helpless.

365
00:21:34,754 --> 00:21:35,823
You did well.

366
00:21:36,954 --> 00:21:38,122
Very well.

367
00:21:38,895 --> 00:21:40,451
How many time has it been already?

368
00:21:40,542 --> 00:21:42,970
Why am I always at death's door?

369
00:21:43,354 --> 00:21:44,834
I ruined two cars.

370
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:45,786
That's true.

371
00:21:46,854 --> 00:21:48,969
I want us to be in a romantic movie,

372
00:21:49,372 --> 00:21:50,830
but it always ends up
being an action movie.

373
00:21:51,701 --> 00:21:53,192
Since we've already ruined two cars,

374
00:21:53,277 --> 00:21:54,800
let's ruin some lipstick as well.

375
00:21:55,617 --> 00:21:58,096
Do you have it with you?

376
00:22:17,186 --> 00:22:19,926
"Minefield
Do Not Enter"

377
00:22:20,411 --> 00:22:22,084
All done. Let's go.

378
00:22:22,754 --> 00:22:23,887
Just a minute.

379
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,423
Not everyone knows English.

380
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:43,866
I'm not complaining.

381
00:22:44,324 --> 00:22:47,389
I'm just trying to get
to the fact straight.

382
00:22:47,821 --> 00:22:50,712
Do we really have to walk back?

383
00:22:51,131 --> 00:22:52,128
For now, at least.

384
00:22:53,131 --> 00:22:56,869
We drove for about 40 minutes
at 60km per hour,

385
00:22:57,224 --> 00:22:58,553
so we have 40km to go.

386
00:22:59,317 --> 00:23:02,557
We'd reach the barracks by nightfall
at my usual march speed,

387
00:23:02,954 --> 00:23:05,104
but at this speed,
we'll be there by morning.

388
00:23:07,806 --> 00:23:08,918
If walking's too boring,

389
00:23:09,574 --> 00:23:11,754
-we can walk holding hands.
-No, thank you.

390
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:13,870
You mentioned me in your recorded will.

391
00:23:13,954 --> 00:23:15,388
I told you that wasn't me.

392
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:18,852
I saved your life again for nothing.

393
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,361
Do you usually...

394
00:23:21,254 --> 00:23:23,712
...change so drastically
before and after a crisis?

395
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,794
She's different in the morning
and in the afternoon.

396
00:23:28,394 --> 00:23:29,290
Me?

397
00:23:29,689 --> 00:23:31,754
How am I different in the morning
and in the afternoon?

398
00:23:31,854 --> 00:23:33,362
In the morning, you're very pretty.

399
00:23:34,254 --> 00:23:35,605
In the afternoon, you're awfully pretty.

400
00:23:36,054 --> 00:23:36,889
Gosh.

401
00:23:38,006 --> 00:23:39,293
Tell me the truth.

402
00:23:39,912 --> 00:23:41,778
You dated a truckload
of girls, didn't you?

403
00:23:41,863 --> 00:23:43,696
Why do women ask that?

404
00:23:44,254 --> 00:23:46,080
They get upset when I say yes,

405
00:23:46,185 --> 00:23:48,436
but don't believe me when I say no.

406
00:23:49,298 --> 00:23:51,786
Who got upset and who didn't believe you?

407
00:23:52,854 --> 00:23:54,505
Oh, there's a truck.

408
00:23:55,425 --> 00:23:57,874
Did you date enough girls
to fill that truck?

409
00:24:00,006 --> 00:24:02,779
Hey, over here. Help please.

410
00:24:11,058 --> 00:24:13,154
I guess the locals
don't consider you pretty.

411
00:24:13,239 --> 00:24:14,239
What did you say?

412
00:24:16,266 --> 00:24:17,180
I see another car coming.

413
00:24:17,265 --> 00:24:18,191
Do you want a ride?

414
00:24:18,546 --> 00:24:20,155
I can carjack it with my gun.

415
00:24:20,701 --> 00:24:22,339
Stay right here.

416
00:24:23,624 --> 00:24:25,777
Hey. Help us.

417
00:24:25,862 --> 00:24:26,969
Over here.

418
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,287
Over here.

419
00:24:28,731 --> 00:24:30,657
Stop. Give us a lift.

420
00:24:34,562 --> 00:24:36,268
I like your idea. Take the car.

421
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:49,377
I guess farmers are kind
anywhere in the world.

422
00:24:50,123 --> 00:24:52,580
You're also different
before and riding a car.

423
00:24:53,706 --> 00:24:56,169
Thank you for saving me again.

424
00:24:56,254 --> 00:24:59,439
I felt so much safer with
you watching my back.

425
00:24:59,524 --> 00:25:00,737
I'll live well.

426
00:25:01,985 --> 00:25:03,006
With someone else?

427
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,118
If that's the case, then don't live well.

428
00:25:11,312 --> 00:25:12,774
I heard you asked Myeongju...

429
00:25:13,494 --> 00:25:15,804
...if her boyfriend's job bothered her.

430
00:25:16,006 --> 00:25:17,969
Did she tell you about that?

431
00:25:18,054 --> 00:25:20,040
She told me to ask you for her answer.

432
00:25:22,227 --> 00:25:23,644
What did she say?

433
00:25:25,654 --> 00:25:27,178
Lieutenant Yoon said...

434
00:25:27,954 --> 00:25:29,749
...being apart from her boyfriend...

435
00:25:30,204 --> 00:25:32,039
...worries her more than what his job is.

436
00:25:33,354 --> 00:25:34,284
What about us?

437
00:25:35,754 --> 00:25:36,620
Will we...

438
00:25:38,396 --> 00:25:39,443
...part ways?

439
00:25:40,147 --> 00:25:41,023
Soon?

440
00:25:43,724 --> 00:25:45,447
Is your name on the list of people...

441
00:25:46,224 --> 00:25:47,725
...returning to Korea?

442
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:50,412
No.

443
00:25:52,854 --> 00:25:54,444
-No?
-No.

444
00:25:55,154 --> 00:25:56,246
I'm staying.

445
00:25:57,112 --> 00:25:57,957
Why?

446
00:25:59,482 --> 00:26:00,654
It can't be because of me.

447
00:26:00,739 --> 00:26:02,234
It is.

448
00:26:03,346 --> 00:26:05,307
I'm staying because of you.

449
00:26:05,958 --> 00:26:07,212
I want to...

450
00:26:07,864 --> 00:26:09,867
...spend time with you
a little bit longer.

451
00:26:12,858 --> 00:26:14,576
I think I just confessed
my feelings right now.

452
00:26:15,854 --> 00:26:16,967
Shall I apologise?

453
00:26:17,454 --> 00:26:19,244
How do you think I'll respond?

454
00:27:25,635 --> 00:27:27,222
You had a long day.

455
00:27:27,897 --> 00:27:30,184
I have to go to the barracks
for the evening roll call.

456
00:27:30,896 --> 00:27:34,312
You went through a lot, too.
I have to check on the patients.

457
00:27:34,459 --> 00:27:35,317
Okay.

458
00:27:35,763 --> 00:27:36,607
Salute.

459
00:27:52,161 --> 00:27:53,862
She'll be really embarrassed later.

460
00:27:53,947 --> 00:27:56,017
He must've been so happy a while ago.

461
00:27:56,164 --> 00:27:57,850
I wish I could go take
the hays off of her.

462
00:27:57,935 --> 00:27:59,829
I wish I could go beat him up.

463
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:03,896
What?

464
00:28:04,522 --> 00:28:05,989
I wish I could beat you up.

465
00:28:41,706 --> 00:28:43,063
Here.

466
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:48,137
It's in here.

467
00:28:51,631 --> 00:28:52,474
Move.

468
00:29:04,088 --> 00:29:05,652
I barely found it.

469
00:29:06,182 --> 00:29:09,392
But as you can see, the lock was broken.

470
00:29:09,601 --> 00:29:11,030
I had no choice.

471
00:29:12,001 --> 00:29:13,993
But to bring the whole thing.

472
00:29:15,158 --> 00:29:18,360
So you guys should open it.

473
00:29:23,221 --> 00:29:24,082
But...

474
00:29:24,591 --> 00:29:28,528
...you are 27 hours and 15 minutes...

475
00:29:30,363 --> 00:29:31,542
...late.

476
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,231
Please, don't kill me.

477
00:29:38,127 --> 00:29:40,379
It was the earthquake.

478
00:29:40,464 --> 00:29:43,960
Do you know what a battlefield and
a disaster scene have in common?

479
00:29:46,154 --> 00:29:47,355
No one cares...

480
00:29:49,624 --> 00:29:51,460
...or even notices the corpse.

481
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:54,457
Please, please let me go.

482
00:29:54,737 --> 00:29:56,093
I'll do anything, everything.

483
00:29:56,178 --> 00:29:57,334
No, no.

484
00:29:59,495 --> 00:30:01,308
You don't have to do everything.

485
00:30:03,694 --> 00:30:06,696
Just do what I tell you.

486
00:30:08,965 --> 00:30:09,860
Okay?

487
00:30:10,076 --> 00:30:11,049
Okay.

488
00:30:11,195 --> 00:30:13,295
Sure. No problem.

489
00:30:13,517 --> 00:30:14,687
Yes, yes.

490
00:30:31,534 --> 00:30:33,890
What do you mean there are no diamonds?

491
00:30:34,768 --> 00:30:36,529
I think... I think he fooled us.

492
00:30:36,614 --> 00:30:37,975
Look, I'll go and get him...

493
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,473
Come on! Think about it.

494
00:30:40,373 --> 00:30:42,159
Do you know what territory
he's already in?

495
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,024
It really hurts.

496
00:31:00,078 --> 00:31:01,308
I can barely...

497
00:31:01,667 --> 00:31:05,423
...turn my head sideways like this.

498
00:31:05,508 --> 00:31:07,128
I'm in a lot of pain.

499
00:31:07,213 --> 00:31:08,382
What's going on?

500
00:31:09,021 --> 00:31:10,979
He was fine until yesterday,

501
00:31:11,047 --> 00:31:12,901
but now he's suddenly in pain.

502
00:31:12,986 --> 00:31:14,159
I bet he'll be dead tomorrow.

503
00:31:14,244 --> 00:31:15,829
Don't you know after-effects
are dangerous?

504
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,684
People even feel it after car accidents,

505
00:31:18,769 --> 00:31:21,023
But I am a patient of an earthquake,

506
00:31:21,108 --> 00:31:23,050
and I'm a victim of an assault.

507
00:31:23,135 --> 00:31:24,957
Please be quiet?

508
00:31:25,624 --> 00:31:27,949
Your X-ray and motor response
test results are clear.

509
00:31:28,034 --> 00:31:28,882
That's correct.

510
00:31:29,996 --> 00:31:33,659
In this LTE day and age, you guys
are still using carrier pigeons.

511
00:31:34,008 --> 00:31:35,148
Look here, ladies.

512
00:31:35,233 --> 00:31:37,848
What can you tell from one X-ray?

513
00:31:38,078 --> 00:31:41,574
I want to get a proper MRI
at a general hospital in Seoul.

514
00:31:41,659 --> 00:31:44,608
Put me on the next plane as a patient.

515
00:31:44,708 --> 00:31:48,212
I told you already
that all the seats are taken.

516
00:31:48,445 --> 00:31:51,816
Do you think we are your
personal travel agents?

517
00:31:52,208 --> 00:31:55,175
-What a joke.
-How dare you talk like that!

518
00:31:57,316 --> 00:32:00,035
Do as I say. I'm Jin Yeongsoo!

519
00:32:00,208 --> 00:32:01,130
And you.

520
00:32:01,616 --> 00:32:04,893
You must have swapped your
manners with your uniform.

521
00:32:04,978 --> 00:32:06,289
I ought to...

522
00:32:06,414 --> 00:32:08,340
Let's talk outside, quietly.

523
00:32:08,425 --> 00:32:09,684
Come with me. Excuse us.

524
00:32:09,769 --> 00:32:12,361
Let go of me. Hey, let go!

525
00:32:12,446 --> 00:32:13,603
Quit glaring at me!

526
00:32:13,883 --> 00:32:15,264
Let me go right now!

527
00:32:15,348 --> 00:32:17,830
Let go so we can talk. Let me...

528
00:32:17,915 --> 00:32:19,250
Fine, I'll walk.

529
00:32:22,708 --> 00:32:23,700
Hey, you.

530
00:32:27,908 --> 00:32:29,087
Did you just hit me?

531
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:30,897
Who are you to...

532
00:32:32,123 --> 00:32:33,335
Do you want to be a patient?

533
00:32:34,305 --> 00:32:36,056
How badly hurt do you want to be?

534
00:32:40,511 --> 00:32:41,692
Should I give you a fracture?

535
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:46,123
Do you want to be a leftie? I can do that.

536
00:32:48,023 --> 00:32:50,925
I can put a hole right here, too.
Tell me what you want.

537
00:32:51,767 --> 00:32:54,441
I can put you in the ICU
for the rest of your life.

538
00:32:54,712 --> 00:32:55,683
No.

539
00:32:56,719 --> 00:32:59,881
My desperation to leave
came across all wrong.

540
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:01,585
I apologise.

541
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:03,046
You can admit everything
outside our compound.

542
00:33:03,131 --> 00:33:05,300
You know where the exit is right?
You have five seconds to leave.

543
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:08,156
-One, two, three...
-Hold on.

544
00:33:08,241 --> 00:33:09,471
Just a moment.

545
00:33:11,687 --> 00:33:14,987
I rarely make mistakes,

546
00:33:15,943 --> 00:33:17,196
but I apologise.

547
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,594
Excuse me, Doctor.

548
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:22,104
Can you tell...

549
00:33:22,237 --> 00:33:24,503
...the lady inside that I apologized?

550
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,725
Do you want to get on
the plane leaving tomorrow?

551
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:29,927
What?

552
00:33:34,455 --> 00:33:35,486
-Bye.
-Bye.

553
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:36,586
-Bye.
-Bye.

554
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:38,170
-See you.
-Bye.

555
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,370
-Bye.
-Bye.

556
00:34:04,177 --> 00:34:07,124
Is Chihoon really staying?

557
00:34:07,209 --> 00:34:08,079
Gosh.

558
00:34:09,907 --> 00:34:11,941
Did that guy steal his seat?

559
00:34:13,127 --> 00:34:15,192
They have to leave now
to get there in time.

560
00:34:17,913 --> 00:34:19,790
-Did you find him?
-No.

561
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:22,150
He must be hiding somewhere.

562
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,837
You should go.

563
00:34:23,922 --> 00:34:26,137
Take care and call us when you arrive.

564
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:28,144
I will. I'll be leaving now.

565
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:30,236
-Stay safe.
-Bye.

566
00:34:30,321 --> 00:34:31,570
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

567
00:34:31,655 --> 00:34:32,855
-Bye.
-Bye.

568
00:34:43,224 --> 00:34:46,048
Do you think something
happened to Doctor Lee?

569
00:34:46,204 --> 00:34:47,057
I know right?

570
00:34:47,269 --> 00:34:49,295
He's been acting really weird lately.

571
00:34:49,396 --> 00:34:52,773
He wore the same shoes
for three days. It's really unlike him.

572
00:34:55,316 --> 00:34:57,383
My gosh, here you are.

573
00:34:57,733 --> 00:34:59,814
We've been looking for you all day.

574
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,797
But I looked in here earlier.

575
00:35:05,623 --> 00:35:06,477
Have they...

576
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:08,598
...all left?

577
00:35:09,233 --> 00:35:10,599
Yes.

578
00:35:10,803 --> 00:35:13,608
Why did you decide to stay
and caused such a fuss?

579
00:35:15,657 --> 00:35:18,653
I do understand how you feel.

580
00:35:18,892 --> 00:35:21,970
Heeun did put on extra weight,
even for an expectant mum.

581
00:35:22,055 --> 00:35:25,859
You must not miss her as much
as if you were newlyweds.

582
00:35:26,783 --> 00:35:29,373
But even then, not wanting to go home...

583
00:35:29,499 --> 00:35:30,877
...only works if...

584
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:33,016
...you stay within Korea.

585
00:35:33,101 --> 00:35:35,432
You're halfway around the world.

586
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,214
This is a little too extreme.

587
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:40,774
It is.

588
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:43,066
It's so far away.

589
00:35:45,217 --> 00:35:46,636
That why I couldn't leave.

590
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:51,044
If I travel that far just to get away,

591
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:54,908
I'm not worthy of being a doctor.

592
00:35:56,769 --> 00:35:57,802
Lee Chihoon.

593
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,068
I'll ask you this only once.

594
00:36:01,172 --> 00:36:04,147
What happened between you and
that patient, Kang Minjae?

595
00:36:04,627 --> 00:36:06,183
I could be of help.

596
00:36:08,686 --> 00:36:09,716
Maybe next time.

597
00:36:12,428 --> 00:36:13,753
Even getting help from someone...

598
00:36:14,613 --> 00:36:15,795
...feels like running away, too.

599
00:36:18,451 --> 00:36:19,451
For now,

600
00:36:19,981 --> 00:36:21,548
I'll try to cope on my own.

601
00:36:23,229 --> 00:36:24,612
If it doesn't work out,

602
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:30,116
I'll tell you then.

603
00:37:01,681 --> 00:37:02,667
Hey, let's go.

604
00:37:11,681 --> 00:37:13,017
May I help you?

605
00:37:14,681 --> 00:37:16,369
No no. Go.

606
00:37:18,798 --> 00:37:19,858
The plane left,

607
00:37:21,324 --> 00:37:22,552
but he didn't show up.

608
00:37:23,503 --> 00:37:25,688
I think he took off after suspecting us.

609
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:30,266
But we set some traps
with the police chief.

610
00:37:33,659 --> 00:37:35,426
He'll do anything to get
out of this country.

611
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:38,902
And I'm going to tear him to
pieces when I see him next.

612
00:37:39,718 --> 00:37:42,926
Prepare a rose instead of a gun
for Colonel Aman's delivery.

613
00:37:44,118 --> 00:37:46,105
The red rose that I chose previously.

614
00:37:46,654 --> 00:37:47,538
Yes, Sir.

615
00:37:47,769 --> 00:37:48,624
Let's go.

616
00:39:05,445 --> 00:39:07,192
Are you targeting to shoot her head?

617
00:39:07,875 --> 00:39:09,287
It's a shot of love.

618
00:39:09,618 --> 00:39:12,279
My target is very pretty.

619
00:39:17,921 --> 00:39:20,189
All is clear
on the soldiers' gun inspection.

620
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:26,033
My gun is all right, too.

621
00:39:26,118 --> 00:39:28,489
The gun seems fine,
but the gunman doesn't.

622
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:30,174
That's not true.

623
00:39:31,495 --> 00:39:33,120
I won't take any more questions.

624
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:35,471
Harry Potter to Wolf.

625
00:39:38,305 --> 00:39:39,868
This is Wolf. What's the matter?

626
00:39:40,028 --> 00:39:42,631
Yellow Tiger is scheduled
to arrive tomorrow afternoon.

627
00:39:45,695 --> 00:39:47,526
Who is Yellow Tiger?

628
00:39:48,179 --> 00:39:50,061
-Don't you know?
-I don't.

629
00:39:51,643 --> 00:39:52,971
Yellow Tiger is...

630
00:39:53,254 --> 00:39:54,845
...the Commander's call sign.

631
00:39:56,141 --> 00:39:57,743
Are you talking about my dad?

632
00:39:59,799 --> 00:40:02,739
In the afternoon, a VIP from Korea,

633
00:40:02,849 --> 00:40:06,693
the Commander, is scheduled to visit
to encourage the Corps.

634
00:40:08,335 --> 00:40:09,576
Don't sigh.

635
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,664
I, as the captain,

636
00:40:12,139 --> 00:40:14,559
won't make a fuss just because,

637
00:40:14,644 --> 00:40:17,225
the Commander is coming to make a visit.

638
00:40:19,939 --> 00:40:21,234
As always, we will...

639
00:40:21,379 --> 00:40:24,975
...do a clean job of weeding near
the storage on military training ground.

640
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,759
And the same as we always do,

641
00:40:27,268 --> 00:40:30,921
we will clean the washroom
with toothpaste until it shines.

642
00:40:31,309 --> 00:40:33,666
We will never make a fuss.

643
00:40:34,425 --> 00:40:37,689
We'll maintain the base
and clean up the supply storage.

644
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:40,895
Be natural, just like we 'normally' are.

645
00:40:42,441 --> 00:40:43,280
Understood?

646
00:41:00,739 --> 00:41:02,005
It's as usual.

647
00:41:04,145 --> 00:41:04,996
Captain.

648
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,515
The Commander is scheduled to have
a meeting with the chief of UN forces.

649
00:41:09,739 --> 00:41:11,402
So his visit has been canceled.

650
00:41:11,544 --> 00:41:12,393
Canceled?

651
00:41:13,136 --> 00:41:16,286
Even if we're our usual selves like this?

652
00:41:17,351 --> 00:41:19,078
Instead, he asked to meet you.

653
00:41:19,271 --> 00:41:21,197
He wants you to come with Doctor Kang.

654
00:41:21,569 --> 00:41:23,629
Sergeant Major Seo and Lieutenant
Yoon are getting ready, too.

655
00:41:36,039 --> 00:41:38,162
Don't worry about me.

656
00:41:39,139 --> 00:41:40,178
I'm not worried.

657
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:41,276
Why would I be?

658
00:41:43,224 --> 00:41:46,303
How should I address Myeongju's father?

659
00:41:49,334 --> 00:41:50,426
Mister Soldier?

660
00:41:59,302 --> 00:42:00,649
Attention.

661
00:42:01,245 --> 00:42:03,424
Salute to Commander.

662
00:42:03,509 --> 00:42:04,822
-Salute.
-Salute.

663
00:42:18,686 --> 00:42:19,548
At ease.

664
00:42:20,586 --> 00:42:21,496
Thank you for your service.

665
00:42:23,219 --> 00:42:25,246
Lieutenant Colonel Park Byeongsoo, Sir!

666
00:42:25,888 --> 00:42:27,626
Colonel Kim Jongho, Sir.

667
00:42:41,092 --> 00:42:41,947
Division Commander.

668
00:42:42,413 --> 00:42:43,504
Before the briefing,

669
00:42:43,698 --> 00:42:45,977
I was hoping to use your
office for 30 minutes...

670
00:42:46,062 --> 00:42:46,898
...for personal reasons.

671
00:42:46,983 --> 00:42:48,540
Yes, Sir.

672
00:42:50,351 --> 00:42:52,438
Yoo Shijin, Seo Daeyeong, Yoon Myeongju...

673
00:42:54,085 --> 00:42:56,173
...and Doctor Kang Moyeon,
I would like to see all of you.

674
00:43:02,772 --> 00:43:05,196
-Please have a seat.
-Yes, Sir.

675
00:43:06,072 --> 00:43:07,485
-It's all right, Sir.
-It's all right, Sir.

676
00:43:15,472 --> 00:43:16,534
Doctor Kang,

677
00:43:17,098 --> 00:43:18,552
you should have become a soldier.

678
00:43:18,882 --> 00:43:21,185
-Pardon?
-I've heard of your accomplishment...

679
00:43:21,464 --> 00:43:24,239
...regarding the Arabian VIP surgery.

680
00:43:25,512 --> 00:43:28,687
With that much vigor, you would
have made a fine soldier.

681
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:29,606
It's a pity.

682
00:43:29,882 --> 00:43:31,391
It's kind of you to say that,

683
00:43:31,476 --> 00:43:33,351
but I have trouble getting up
in the morning.

684
00:43:34,272 --> 00:43:35,907
That must be why you're so beautiful.

685
00:43:38,175 --> 00:43:41,396
Whatever the process has been,
the result was beneficial for our country.

686
00:43:41,711 --> 00:43:43,285
I express my deepest gratitude.

687
00:43:43,576 --> 00:43:44,875
I hope to meet you again.

688
00:43:44,988 --> 00:43:46,893
That's all I have to say to you.

689
00:43:48,828 --> 00:43:50,384
All right. Then I'll excuse myself.

690
00:44:01,114 --> 00:44:04,139
I received report of your work
on the rescue operation.

691
00:44:04,935 --> 00:44:06,888
Have you three been injured?

692
00:44:06,973 --> 00:44:08,072
-No sir.
-No sir.

693
00:44:09,114 --> 00:44:09,947
Good.

694
00:44:11,342 --> 00:44:12,580
Then now,

695
00:44:13,072 --> 00:44:14,402
disregarding rank,

696
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:17,098
I will ask as Myeongju's father.

697
00:44:18,458 --> 00:44:19,499
Starting with Yoo Shijin.

698
00:44:21,072 --> 00:44:22,964
Captain Yoo Shijin, Sir.

699
00:44:24,142 --> 00:44:25,191
Yoo Shijin,

700
00:44:26,028 --> 00:44:28,252
are you an ally or an enemy of mine?

701
00:44:28,729 --> 00:44:30,542
Make your identity clear!

702
00:44:31,345 --> 00:44:34,527
Are you really not
interested in my daughter?

703
00:44:34,618 --> 00:44:35,640
Dad.

704
00:44:41,222 --> 00:44:42,999
Lieutenant Yoon is a beloved colleague.

705
00:44:43,501 --> 00:44:44,358
However...

706
00:44:45,003 --> 00:44:46,747
...during the seven years
that I have known her,

707
00:44:47,872 --> 00:44:49,675
I never had any feelings towards her.

708
00:44:53,772 --> 00:44:55,249
That's a pity.

709
00:44:59,066 --> 00:45:00,094
All right.

710
00:45:00,404 --> 00:45:01,247
You may leave.

711
00:45:06,425 --> 00:45:07,797
Why are you out so soon?

712
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:09,929
I thought you had something
serious to talk about.

713
00:45:10,903 --> 00:45:11,776
We did.

714
00:45:12,957 --> 00:45:14,331
I was kicked out right after.

715
00:45:14,772 --> 00:45:16,369
-From the army?
-No.

716
00:45:16,645 --> 00:45:17,986
From the Commander's favour.

717
00:45:19,193 --> 00:45:21,944
As of today, I've been dismissed
as a potential son-in-law.

718
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:26,794
-Then...
-Yes, the love triangle has ended.

719
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:31,046
I'm a man with a past.
Are you all right with that?

720
00:45:35,728 --> 00:45:40,070
Then what will happen to Lieutenant Yoon
and Sergeant Major Seo?

721
00:45:40,602 --> 00:45:41,471
I don't know.

722
00:45:42,731 --> 00:45:43,784
Difficult tasks...

723
00:45:44,238 --> 00:45:45,628
...are always for Sergeant Major Seo.

724
00:45:58,788 --> 00:45:59,641
How is it then?

725
00:46:00,823 --> 00:46:03,222
Do you still like Seo Daeyoung
after seeing him again?

726
00:46:03,912 --> 00:46:05,031
Yes, I do.

727
00:46:07,748 --> 00:46:08,885
Seo Daeyoung, what about you?

728
00:46:09,455 --> 00:46:10,898
Do you feel the same way?

729
00:46:12,086 --> 00:46:14,649
Ask me. Why do you keep
bringing him into this?

730
00:46:14,734 --> 00:46:15,667
Yes, Sir.

731
00:46:19,598 --> 00:46:23,396
I thought we shared the same thoughts.

732
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:28,875
I thought you were going to back down
in this fight for her.

733
00:46:31,224 --> 00:46:34,240
Answer me, Seo Daeyeong.

734
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:36,303
My answer is...

735
00:46:37,083 --> 00:46:39,102
I don't care whatever he says.

736
00:46:39,726 --> 00:46:41,253
I won't leave him.

737
00:46:56,672 --> 00:46:57,714
I will hold on...

738
00:46:59,176 --> 00:47:00,210
...to this hand.

739
00:47:03,744 --> 00:47:06,542
Do you think you're qualified
to hold that hand?

740
00:47:06,627 --> 00:47:09,737
If you transfer me,
I will go as I always have.

741
00:47:10,629 --> 00:47:12,540
However, I won't let go of this hand.

742
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:16,406
Yoon Myeongju, go outside.

743
00:47:16,491 --> 00:47:17,427
No.

744
00:47:18,873 --> 00:47:21,291
-You can say it to me, too.
-What did I tell you earlier?

745
00:47:22,419 --> 00:47:23,709
Don't worry about me.

746
00:47:33,512 --> 00:47:37,506
In my 30 years as a soldier,
there are only two things I wanted.

747
00:47:38,784 --> 00:47:40,322
First, becoming an honorable Commander.

748
00:47:40,672 --> 00:47:43,040
Second, be respected by my daughter,
who's also a soldier.

749
00:47:46,596 --> 00:47:47,777
But...

750
00:47:48,788 --> 00:47:51,252
...it appears like I've failed
on both accounts.

751
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:56,189
My orders to you were unreasonable,

752
00:47:57,369 --> 00:47:59,280
and my daughter does not respect me.

753
00:48:01,173 --> 00:48:02,174
What can I do?

754
00:48:03,872 --> 00:48:07,037
Now that I know how you feel,
it's time to share my feelings, too.

755
00:48:07,949 --> 00:48:09,216
I won't beat around the bush.

756
00:48:11,173 --> 00:48:12,826
You may date Myeongju.

757
00:48:14,042 --> 00:48:17,663
And of course, I also have
your marriage in my mind, too.

758
00:48:19,391 --> 00:48:20,631
Do you mean that?

759
00:48:23,423 --> 00:48:24,539
I do.

760
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:30,780
However,

761
00:48:31,577 --> 00:48:34,260
I won't have a sergeant major
as a son-in-law.

762
00:48:35,121 --> 00:48:36,559
You have to quit being a soldier.

763
00:48:38,009 --> 00:48:39,302
Quit being a soldier,

764
00:48:39,775 --> 00:48:42,367
and go work for the company owned
by Myeongju's mother's side.

765
00:48:44,048 --> 00:48:47,412
I will find a job for you
in an associated company...

766
00:48:47,512 --> 00:48:49,069
...that's related to your
previous experiences.

767
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:52,677
Think about this until
your overseas discharge is over.

768
00:48:53,591 --> 00:48:56,466
You must come back
to the country with a decision.

769
00:48:57,464 --> 00:48:59,241
Decide if you are going
to let go of her hand,

770
00:49:00,684 --> 00:49:03,120
or if you will become a man
who is worthy of that hand.

771
00:49:25,185 --> 00:49:26,476
What are you thinking about?

772
00:49:28,951 --> 00:49:30,568
I'm thinking about
Lieutenant Yoon and you.

773
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,578
Myeongju and me?

774
00:49:34,172 --> 00:49:35,072
Yes.

775
00:49:35,835 --> 00:49:37,989
I can't seem to understand
no matter how much I think about it.

776
00:49:38,563 --> 00:49:40,487
Why in the world didn't you date Myeongju?

777
00:49:40,831 --> 00:49:42,003
She's young, she's smart,

778
00:49:42,088 --> 00:49:44,076
she's from a good family,
and she has a great body.

779
00:49:44,161 --> 00:49:46,253
She's flawless and perfect.

780
00:49:48,985 --> 00:49:51,132
Should I date anyone
who is pretty and from a good family?

781
00:49:53,043 --> 00:49:54,610
So you did think she was pretty.

782
00:49:55,416 --> 00:49:56,990
I didn't say anything
about how pretty she was.

783
00:49:58,723 --> 00:50:00,225
Are you jealous?

784
00:50:01,293 --> 00:50:02,901
Come here and hold this.

785
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:10,321
Here.

786
00:50:12,688 --> 00:50:14,107
Why are you changing the subject?

787
00:50:14,491 --> 00:50:16,115
If she was so pretty,
you should've dated her.

788
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,580
Tell me, what's so pretty about her?

789
00:50:24,331 --> 00:50:25,358
What are you doing?

790
00:50:25,442 --> 00:50:27,771
I'm shutting your mouth in a sexy way.

791
00:50:28,502 --> 00:50:29,811
Try talking again.

792
00:50:30,591 --> 00:50:31,762
Go away.

793
00:50:41,206 --> 00:50:43,106
When will this be done?

794
00:50:44,608 --> 00:50:47,564
It was already done a while ago.

795
00:50:48,914 --> 00:50:50,092
I will go pay.

796
00:50:58,458 --> 00:51:02,241
Get him. Stop that thief!

797
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:06,041
Hey.

798
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:08,812
Let's put this aside for now. Okay?

799
00:51:09,342 --> 00:51:10,446
What's going on?

800
00:51:12,508 --> 00:51:13,342
It's okay.

801
00:51:15,333 --> 00:51:17,479
It looks like he stole any medicine
because he was sick.

802
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,410
Let's take him to Medicube.

803
00:51:20,793 --> 00:51:23,586
No, we need to go to his village.

804
00:51:24,142 --> 00:51:26,125
He's feverish, he has spots and papules.

805
00:51:26,228 --> 00:51:27,993
If my diagnosis is correct,

806
00:51:28,082 --> 00:51:30,033
he has measles.
It's an infectious disease.

807
00:51:30,752 --> 00:51:32,720
We need to stop this
before it spreads further.

808
00:51:33,208 --> 00:51:34,333
That is unbelievable.

809
00:51:34,971 --> 00:51:35,988
Are you serious?

810
00:51:36,137 --> 00:51:37,740
If you want out, tell me now.

811
00:51:37,869 --> 00:51:39,263
You won't have any more chances.

812
00:51:39,348 --> 00:51:40,426
Are you serious?

813
00:51:41,094 --> 00:51:42,363
Is this for real?

814
00:51:43,236 --> 00:51:45,237
Did he really give us his permission?

815
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:49,374
Yes, Ma'am.

816
00:51:50,846 --> 00:51:54,631
I, Seo Daeyeong, have been commanded
to date Lieutenant Yoon Myeongju.

817
00:51:54,716 --> 00:51:56,901
I report to you. Salute.

818
00:52:00,873 --> 00:52:03,664
Why did this happen? What's going on?
What will I do?

819
00:52:05,753 --> 00:52:06,895
Does my father have cancer?

820
00:52:07,772 --> 00:52:09,709
Is he suffering from a terminal illness?

821
00:52:10,185 --> 00:52:11,672
I should call him.

822
00:52:11,965 --> 00:52:14,542
I could tell by his voice
if he is telling the truth or not.

823
00:52:14,801 --> 00:52:15,683
I'm going to call him.

824
00:52:23,706 --> 00:52:24,809
My goodness.

825
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:05,038
Big Boss to Command.

826
00:53:05,308 --> 00:53:06,484
We have arrived at the village.

827
00:53:07,389 --> 00:53:10,057
Track and confirm our GPS coordinates.

828
00:53:10,142 --> 00:53:12,382
Copy that.

829
00:53:24,732 --> 00:53:25,584
Salute.

830
00:53:27,672 --> 00:53:31,252
We tracked his coordinates before
he got cut off, but it's weird...

831
00:53:31,512 --> 00:53:34,129
...because the map shows
no village in that area.

832
00:53:34,766 --> 00:53:35,655
Really?

833
00:53:36,116 --> 00:53:37,585
Do you remember
that doctor from Peacemaker?

834
00:53:37,734 --> 00:53:39,027
Go look for him.

835
00:53:39,306 --> 00:53:40,172
Yes, Sir.

836
00:53:47,572 --> 00:53:49,342
How long have they been sick?

837
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:56,652
The kids.

838
00:53:57,069 --> 00:53:58,398
Since when...

839
00:53:59,672 --> 00:54:01,848
...have they been sick?

840
00:54:05,489 --> 00:54:06,865
I don't think they understand you.

841
00:54:07,543 --> 00:54:09,167
They definitely have measles.
What should I do?

842
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:12,395
We have to gather
all the children for a check-up.

843
00:54:13,482 --> 00:54:17,532
We get no food for three days
if we speak to strangers.

844
00:54:17,617 --> 00:54:20,181
That's a relief. She speaks English.

845
00:54:24,406 --> 00:54:26,532
Is it okay for you to speak to us?

846
00:54:26,768 --> 00:54:28,920
It doesn't matter to me any more.

847
00:54:29,131 --> 00:54:31,174
Can you bring all the children together?

848
00:54:31,452 --> 00:54:33,646
The kids here have measles.

849
00:54:33,924 --> 00:54:36,609
And it's a very serious viral disease.

850
00:54:36,783 --> 00:54:38,563
If they don't get treated now,

851
00:54:38,648 --> 00:54:41,763
about 70 percent will
die or become disabled.

852
00:54:41,848 --> 00:54:44,865
It's better to die now than to live here.

853
00:54:46,377 --> 00:54:48,499
The boys here become a gang member.

854
00:54:48,584 --> 00:54:51,277
And the girls are sold
to a pimp when they grow up.

855
00:54:52,245 --> 00:54:53,844
Today is my turn.

856
00:55:00,872 --> 00:55:03,963
I will cooperate, but under one condition.

857
00:55:04,048 --> 00:55:05,743
Get me out of here.

858
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,426
What is this place?

859
00:55:11,937 --> 00:55:13,345
It's the Ghost Village.

860
00:55:13,772 --> 00:55:17,180
It's where war orphans live,
and it's controlled by the local gangs.

861
00:55:17,549 --> 00:55:19,665
They abduct kids
and keep them for sex-trafficking,

862
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:21,376
instead looking after them.

863
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:27,470
The Ghost Village?

864
00:55:28,113 --> 00:55:31,891
Sometimes, all of the kids
are sold off between gangs.

865
00:55:32,305 --> 00:55:33,709
They are always on the move.

866
00:55:33,794 --> 00:55:35,252
That's why it's called the Ghost Village.

867
00:55:43,237 --> 00:55:44,237
Hold on for a moment.

868
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:46,963
I think you should hurry and get here.

869
00:55:47,109 --> 00:55:48,489
I just saw the owner return.

870
00:56:16,942 --> 00:56:18,309
Are you their guardian?

871
00:56:18,732 --> 00:56:20,487
Oh, we have a guest.

872
00:56:20,572 --> 00:56:22,252
I'm a doctor from Korea.

873
00:56:22,572 --> 00:56:24,560
Some children here have measles.

874
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:27,194
Can I take them to the field hospital?

875
00:56:27,279 --> 00:56:30,199
You're too beautiful to be doing
something good like this.

876
00:56:34,269 --> 00:56:35,328
Stay behind me.

877
00:56:36,115 --> 00:56:37,720
It's good to see you again, Captain.

878
00:56:41,298 --> 00:56:44,330
Now, what a coincidence to see you
in a place like this?

879
00:56:47,663 --> 00:56:48,978
Do you know him?

880
00:56:50,173 --> 00:56:51,151
Who is he?

881
00:56:54,042 --> 00:56:55,112
He's the 'Private Ryan'.

882
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:22,703
I think I have the advantage
this time, Big Boss.

883
00:57:39,136 --> 00:57:39,989
Boss.

884
00:57:42,145 --> 00:57:44,210
Hurry up, let's leave now.

885
00:57:44,295 --> 00:57:45,570
This is our last chance.

886
00:57:48,412 --> 00:57:49,640
Freeze, don't move.

887
00:57:49,725 --> 00:57:51,488
Hey Doctor, do something.

888
00:57:51,572 --> 00:57:53,965
No, don't. Just kill him.

889
00:57:54,042 --> 00:57:55,203
Let him die.

890
00:57:57,572 --> 00:57:59,305
Doctor, what are you waiting for?

891
00:58:01,042 --> 00:58:02,294
Do your job.

892
00:58:02,542 --> 00:58:05,549
Please, let him die. Please.

893
00:58:09,572 --> 00:58:10,966
You took an oath!

894
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:14,836
Don't take that chance away
for me to kill that girl.

895
00:58:23,672 --> 00:58:25,189
I don't think I should save this guy.

896
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:28,700
I think I should just let him be.

897
00:58:29,656 --> 00:58:31,240
If I save this guy,

898
00:58:32,072 --> 00:58:34,480
he may end up killing more people.

899
00:58:35,899 --> 00:58:36,748
Save him.

900
00:58:38,123 --> 00:58:40,444
You do your job as a doctor.

901
00:58:42,315 --> 00:58:43,858
If the situation arises
for him to be killed,

902
00:58:47,216 --> 00:58:48,889
then I should be the one to kill him.

903
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,592
"Descendants of the Sun"

904
00:59:36,677 --> 00:59:38,117
It seems like nobody is around.

905
00:59:38,242 --> 00:59:39,395
The village is empty.

906
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,857
This operation isn't about justice.
It's about politics.

907
00:59:41,942 --> 00:59:43,871
You got a parcel from a Shin Young.

908
00:59:43,956 --> 00:59:45,058
Where are you?

909
00:59:45,142 --> 00:59:47,164
You need to come to the medicine storage.
It's a mess.

910
00:59:47,249 --> 00:59:48,942
If I don't come out within five minutes,

911
00:59:49,042 --> 00:59:50,328
you must leave before me.

912
00:59:50,412 --> 00:59:52,587
That corpse must've been Mr Jin's body.

913
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:55,580
I believe it is a pestilence
caused by an M-type virus.

914
00:59:55,772 --> 00:59:58,460
Everyone, stop. Take your hands off
and back away from the table.

915
00:59:58,545 --> 00:59:59,390
Now!
