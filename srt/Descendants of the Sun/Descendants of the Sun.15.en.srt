1
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,237
Didn't I look like a
beautiful painting just now?

2
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,407
You often do.

3
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,143
The discharge procedure is done.
You can go now.

4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,511
Let's take the car.

5
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,913
Today, I'll be your girlfriend
instead of your doctor.

6
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,481
Wow, really?

7
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,251
I'm so excited. Let's go!

8
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,155
It's really nice weather.

9
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,191
Urk's clouds were really pretty.

10
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,393
Should we go back again?
The two of us together?

11
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:44,494
Together?

12
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:47,110
Why? You want to go
with some other punk?

13
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,399
-It's not like there isn't a way.
-Hah! Seriously...

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,601
But what are you listening to?

15
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,138
It's something I like the most.
Do you want to listen?

16
00:01:04,614 --> 00:01:06,830
If I knew I would die like this,

17
00:01:07,184 --> 00:01:11,790
then I would have told
you my true feelings.

18
00:01:11,955 --> 00:01:14,357
-Hey!
-Oh! Oh! Hey! Hey! Hey!

19
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,161
Dr. Kang! Dr. Kang!

20
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:23,767
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

21
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,940
Are you okay? Oh no! Oh no!

22
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,007
I'm fine, and only because it's me.

23
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,743
Oh, this is terrible.
It's quite expensive.

24
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,179
What do I do?

25
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,583
Were you asking if the
wheelchair was okay?

26
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,300
I nearly died 10 minutes after
being released from the hospital.

27
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,489
This is like attempted murder.

28
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,024
So why were you listening to that?

29
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,160
Oh! What do I do about the wheelchair?

30
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,500
This woman, seriously. Now you're
even breaking a wheelchair.

31
00:01:53,597 --> 00:01:56,500
You know, let's not use
public transportation.

32
00:01:56,633 --> 00:01:58,101
For the safety of the citizens.

33
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,103
As if you did nothing wrong.

34
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:20,457
Say what you need to say. I'm going
to leave after I finish eating.

35
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,293
-I'm almost done.
-I have nothing to say.

36
00:02:28,498 --> 00:02:30,590
If you have nothing to say, why
did you ask me to eat with you?

37
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,868
Because you're too skinny.

38
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,377
It's because I'm confused,
but what are we?

39
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,380
Did we break up, or did
we have an argument?

40
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:44,848
What are we?

41
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,919
Are we going to break up, or are
we in the middle of breaking up,

42
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:50,954
or have we broken up?

43
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,658
I'm in the process of
going to Yoon Myung Ju.

44
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,459
That means you haven't
changed your mind.

45
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,110
Please make it so that I can give up.

46
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,780
So after leaving the military, you
want to go to my uncle's company

47
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,490
and live as my father's son-in-law?
You'll endure that?

48
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,335
-But you'll be next to me.
-Yeah.

49
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,237
You look like you're dying of happiness.

50
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:12,576
I'll get out. I won't see my father.

51
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:16,346
Father has his own life and I have mine.

52
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,160
I can live without seeing him.

53
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,950
Is that the only thing you can say?

54
00:03:20,917 --> 00:03:24,254
In time, you will be promoted to be Major,
Lieutenant Colonel, and Colonel. And perhaps...

55
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,357
No, since it's you, you'll
definitely get a star.

56
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,427
A capable and gutsy
Military Surgeon daughter!

57
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,330
Even if it was me, I would also oppose.

58
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:40,870
I know what you're saying,
but I despise you.

59
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,739
Do you think you're endearing?

60
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,809
You're done, right? I
really came to feed you.

61
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,244
I'll be going.

62
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,149
Next time, bring your answer
instead of money for the bill.

63
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,118
Whether we'll break up or not.

64
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,179
What are you doing?

65
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,782
I'm going to wash up now.

66
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,100
In that little time, you
want to see me again?

67
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,322
You said you were going to wash up.

68
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,757
And?

69
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,326
But you're still dressed.

70
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,330
Is that why you did a video call?

71
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,930
Not because you wanted to see me?

72
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,940
I want to see you. In many ways.

73
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,136
Pervert... I'm going to get
undressed after we hang up,

74
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,103
so hang up!

75
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:58,682
Why did you lie? You said you were going
to get undressed once we hung up.

76
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,284
You're asking for trouble!

77
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:04,170
What are you doing here at this hour?
Are you already done with work?

78
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,255
I took a sick leave.

79
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,558
Because my injuries hurt so much,
I need to get a medical report.

80
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,994
Then you should have
gone to the hospital.

81
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,630
But I have to see my doctor in
order to get a medical report.

82
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,100
What is this when you're in pain?

83
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,269
Pain reliever?

84
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,305
Oh, before I get a medical report,
let's do something else first.

85
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:23,573
Filling up the tub.

86
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,209
-Don't even dream of it.
-It's my dream, so it's up to me.

87
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,046
I'll wait, so go wash up.

88
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,816
Why do you keep telling me to wash up?
It's my body, so it's up to me.

89
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,652
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

90
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,921
Don't even think about drinking alone.
I know how many there are.

91
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:47,364
Whoa. What is this?

92
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,934
It's a present. So you can
look beautiful from any angle.

93
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,137
You really are very beautiful.

94
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,172
Huh! I guess you didn't know.

95
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,530
How did you know which candle I like?

96
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,680
-By sight.
-After seeing it only once?

97
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,445
Do you think I came here only once?

98
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,948
-No.
-How many times?

99
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,250
Why? I'm not curious.

100
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,986
You will put that down.

101
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,260
Ah! I remember, I remember!
The day I got drunk.

102
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,824
-When?
-A long time ago.

103
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,562
Don't even think about
drinking with some other punk!

104
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,130
What if I do? Are you going to
come and get me in a helicopter?

105
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,400
Do you think I can't?

106
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:29,005
Oh, that's right. The day you came to
rescue me from Private Ryan's house,

107
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,508
why did an Arab helicopter come?

108
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,247
Ah, I hurt this arm when I fell over...

109
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:41,251
-You didn't fall on that side.
-Exactly. I fell on this side.

110
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,556
Tell me the truth. I won't get mad.

111
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,158
You promise?

112
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,593
Hurry up and tell me honestly
that you didn't use the business card.

113
00:06:52,595 --> 00:06:53,663
Shall we make a toast?

114
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,520
Seriously, you used it
again on that helicopter?

115
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:00,937
That is... Aren't you considering the
fact that you lived because of it?

116
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,773
Who cares whether I live or not when
I don't have the business card?

117
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,700
Tell me honestly. Wasn't there
anything in the helicopter?

118
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,711
Like the deed to an oil factory or...

119
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,146
No. Cash is okay, too.

120
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,981
A bond is also very convenient!

121
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:15,010
Think carefully. Wasn't there something like
a black briefcase that 007 would carry?

122
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,954
Ah, I'm so thirsty. Where's the water?
Where is it?

123
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,422
Stop right there.

124
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:23,927
Really. Really, how could you
use it on transportation again?

125
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,296
It's not like that business card
is some sort of a transport card.

126
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,064
What are you going to do
about my business card!

127
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,635
Oh, this materialistic person. Oh.

128
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,137
Hey!

129
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,108
-Just do your best.
-I'll do my best, Dad.

130
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,477
I believe in you, my daughter!

131
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:42,512
Do well!

132
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:47,350
Ki Bum!

133
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,519
What are you doing here?

134
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,988
Did you come to cheer me on?

135
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:57,093
Personally? In person? Dare to?
Maybe "dare to" is wrong.

136
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:00,763
"Dare to"? It's daringly. Daringly!

137
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,633
Sergeant Gong, is he going
to pass at this rate?

138
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,168
There's always a way.

139
00:08:06,035 --> 00:08:07,770
Taffy! Make sure you pass!

140
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,172
Pick the right answers!

141
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:13,843
Eat well, get your strength
up, pick well, and pass!

142
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:20,917
When in doubt, it's always number three.
You can do well, right?

143
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,186
Private Kim Ki Bum!

144
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:26,656
I even went to the army, so a
qualification exam is nothing.

145
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,927
I will definitely come back
triumphantly! Power of unity!

146
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,263
That's right. Do well.

147
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:34,998
Fighting!

148
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,733
-When in doubt, I'll pick no. 3
-Fighting!

149
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,506
People are staring at us.

150
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,709
Act like a civilian.
Just like a civilian.

151
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:51,281
Ah, seriously. This is not it!

152
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,752
How did you think you can
wear normal clothes...

153
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,227
Power of unity!

154
00:09:09,832 --> 00:09:11,668
Alpha Team, it's a combined operation.

155
00:09:11,901 --> 00:09:13,290
After putting on winter military gear,

156
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:16,706
come to 464 airport by 21:00 today.

157
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,516
Deputy Team Leader, the
Commander is asking for you.

158
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,420
It's a three-month long mission.

159
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,723
With the excuse that there's
no one to replace you yet,

160
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,926
I'm thinking about sending
you to this operation.

161
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:44,350
If not, you have an option to sign
your discharge request right now.

162
00:09:44,467 --> 00:09:45,268
What should we do?

163
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,004
I want to go.

164
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,508
Good. Go then and come back.

165
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:56,012
Due to the special circumstance
of the Alpha Team,

166
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:59,248
I will process your discharge request after
your replacement position has been filled.

167
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,084
Let's settle it this way.

168
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,520
I don't know when your
replacement will be determined.

169
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,825
I apologize, but you're saying that...

170
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:12,095
When you return, come with Myung Ju.
We will have a cup...

171
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,799
no, make that two, cups of tea.

172
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:19,702
-Commander...
-Departure is 21:00. Don't be late.

173
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:22,905
Come back healthy and safely.

174
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:29,579
Sergeant First Class Seo Dae
Young will return safely.

175
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,180
Power of unity.

176
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,216
Power of unity.

177
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:19,996
What is it?

178
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,460
Chwadi means baby goat in Arabic.

179
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,435
How come there's never an introduction, always
transitions, transitions, and transitions?

180
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,203
What about a baby goat?

181
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,174
Introduction, I am friends with
Daniel on a social network.

182
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,310
Development, I wrote, "Hi, Chwadi.
You are doing well, right?"

183
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,846
and Daniel told me chwadi
means baby goat.

184
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:41,470
Transition, So Chwadi
wasn't Blekie's name...

185
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,352
You still haven't found out his name?

186
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,223
Conclusion, clench your teeth.

187
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:48,970
Clench them firmly.

188
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:51,527
I always heard chwadi this
and chwadi that, so...

189
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:52,962
Hello?

190
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,690
We still have two and half
hours left until our date.

191
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,336
You're here early like last time.

192
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,442
What is it?

193
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,113
I guess you aren't here early.

194
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,081
No.

195
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,717
The department store again?

196
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:15,885
Yes.

197
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,490
This time I'll be gone a little long.

198
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,726
I didn't think I'd have
any time except now,

199
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,962
so I wanted to see your
face before I left.

200
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:30,032
How long is long? A week? Two weeks?

201
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,702
Three months.

202
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:38,107
Three months? Is it an
overseas department store?

203
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,011
Just pretend I'm enlisting in the army.

204
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:45,581
They usually grant a leave
after a hundred days.

205
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:51,020
Are you making "Gomooshin" now?

206
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,022
Don't drink with another guy.

207
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,200
I'm sorry. I was trying not
to, but it isn't working.

208
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,242
I'm sorry for making you have to try.

209
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,211
Come back quickly if you know that.

210
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,881
Don't get hurt. Don't be late.

211
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:23,753
I won't get hurt. I won't die.

212
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:29,025
I'll be sure to come back, I promise.

213
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,164
Can you keep in touch?

214
00:13:37,099 --> 00:13:39,635
It's somewhere that international
data doesn't work.

215
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:43,906
I'll be sure to call you whenever I can.

216
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:49,078
Just spend one season well.

217
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:54,250
I'll be sure to return around
when the seasons change.

218
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:58,921
Then...

219
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,926
Already? Wait.

220
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:15,771
I'll miss you.

221
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,141
Me, too.

222
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,243
Big Boss...

223
00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:04,186
...he's smart, funny, and mysterious,

224
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:10,593
but he has a lot of secrets.

225
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,863
He'll disappear from time to time.

226
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,198
Be hard to contact.

227
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,968
And then one day,

228
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:26,142
he'll never come back.

229
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,650
Sunbae! Sunbae!

230
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,753
Sunbae!

231
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,689
Oh, what is it?

232
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,425
Are you okay? Why are you being
like this since yesterday?

233
00:15:42,425 --> 00:15:43,459
You're worrying me.

234
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,900
I arrived safely.

235
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:54,236
I really miss you.

236
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,242
I'm on my way to work.

237
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,612
The sky in Korea is really high.
How is it there?

238
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,415
Is it cold there or
is it a warm country?

239
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,020
Wherever you are, I really,
really, really miss you.

240
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,923
They are playing the
National Anthem on TV.

241
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:17,893
Why is the National Anthem the
theme song of my dating life?

242
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:22,264
Koreans should stay as a Korean...

243
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,469
Come back quickly! I miss you!

244
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,807
The emergency room was so busy,
I'm just eating lunch now.

245
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:34,543
It's already winter here.

246
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,560
You said you'd come when
the seasons change.

247
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:38,714
Why aren't you coming?

248
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:42,550
To not hear from you, makes me sad...

249
00:16:59,902 --> 00:17:02,204
It would be nice if you
were coming back on that.

250
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:17,186
Go back first! I'll take the
next helicopter with Wolf!

251
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,454
Yes, Sir!

252
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,856
Go! Go!

253
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,594
Big Boss transmitting.

254
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,598
The helicopter transporting
three civilians just departed.

255
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,701
We just have to wait ten
minutes to return home.

256
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,969
Yes, Sir.

257
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,874
Captain!

258
00:17:40,042 --> 00:17:42,711
Team Captain!

259
00:17:45,114 --> 00:17:46,415
Team Captain!

260
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,352
Team Captain.

261
00:18:39,902 --> 00:18:40,836
No...

262
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,507
Hurry up and get on. Let's go home!

263
00:18:50,246 --> 00:18:52,414
We have to go back and drink soju
all night for three days straight.

264
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:55,317
Yes,

265
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,128
I will go.

266
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,065
What are you saying? Stay alert, Sir!

267
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,467
You can't fall asleep.

268
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,069
Look at me, Team Captain!

269
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,773
You can't fall asleep, Team Captain!

270
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,218
Big Boss, do you hear me?!

271
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,387
What is the situation?

272
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:34,190
Anyone, please respond!

273
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:39,161
No!

274
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:40,810
Team Captain!

275
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,164
Team Captain!

276
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,632
Wait!

277
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,301
Team Captain!

278
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,535
Captain!

279
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,237
No!

280
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,725
Aren't you being too much?

281
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:13,128
Even if you're in Mars and I sent a
letter, it would have arrived by now.

282
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:16,899
I will be drinking with
a really handsome man.

283
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:18,867
You should come and get me.

284
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,612
If he hasn't seen the message,

285
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,314
then you should think that he must be
somewhere where he can't check it.

286
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:35,484
Why are you sending it everyday and then
getting upset and angry every single day?

287
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:39,588
So that he would feel sorry when he
sees how upset I was every single day.

288
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,857
But are they really unreachable like
this every time there is a mission?

289
00:20:41,857 --> 00:20:44,326
Whether they can be reachable or
not, I have always been ignored.

290
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:47,229
Since there were more days of our
break up than actually dating.

291
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:50,266
This time, did you two
make up before he left?

292
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,002
There's no making up.

293
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:55,704
This is not just a lover's
quarrel but a war.

294
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,873
A war that I can't lose.

295
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:02,778
Seeing that he left his dog tags, I
think I'm at a slight advantage.

296
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,146
Cheers.

297
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,048
Cheers.

298
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:10,350
Just he dare come back. Be it
work or whatnot I will quit

299
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,170
and stick to him for a whole week.

300
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,623
I will confiscate that person's
cellphone and go on a vacation.

301
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,300
I will reserve the hotel in advance.

302
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,594
Go on a vacation somewhere
far and fight it out.

303
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,690
-Whoa!
-Did he text back?

304
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,872
Corporal Kim will get rewards
for winning a soccer game.

305
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,074
I registered in "Gomooshin" fan cafe.

306
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:35,430
Congratulations.

307
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,246
Hye Kyung Gomooshin-nim.

308
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,381
I'm going crazy.

309
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:44,019
Just pour me a drink,
Mo Yeon Gomooshin-nim.

310
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,655
You really have high
tolerance on alcohol.

311
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,195
It's raining.

312
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,965
It has been since this morning.

313
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:05,207
Those men... it would have been great
if they were here since a while ago.

314
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,712
It's about time for them to come.

315
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:14,550
Right? They will come soon, right?

316
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:38,640
Attention!

317
00:22:40,576 --> 00:22:41,744
Salute the Commander.

318
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,246
Power of unity!

319
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,152
At ease.

320
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,423
Joint operation mission
has been completed.

321
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,091
The bodies

322
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:02,231
haven't been found.

323
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,661
Sergeant Kim Beom Rae.

324
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,864
Yes, why?

325
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,900
Sergeant Kim Beom Rae.

326
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:47,236
Say it, what is it?

327
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,207
Sergeant First Class Seo came back.

328
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:54,743
I will be there.

329
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,180
Tell him to stay still and wait.

330
00:25:01,717 --> 00:25:03,085
Sergeant Kim Beom Rae.

331
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,256
I will be reporting.

332
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:13,028
Staff Sergeant Choi. Hello.

333
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:15,797
I thought it was Captain
Yoo when I saw the jeep.

334
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:18,166
But then, what brings you here?

335
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,374
I am really...

336
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:30,479
sorry.

337
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:33,315
What for?

338
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,853
Special Forces Captain Yoo Si Jin,

339
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:42,925
Sergeant First Class Seo Dae Young

340
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:45,060
during the tactical attack

341
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,698
have passed away.

342
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,635
What?

343
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:56,104
How could you report such a thing?

344
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:03,078
I... don't understand a single thing.

345
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:05,113
What should I do?

346
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,953
Aren't you going to report properly?

347
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,424
Do as you usually do.

348
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:19,795
Say it again.

349
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,933
I said, say it again!

350
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:50,425
Before we go on a
mission, we write a will.

351
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:56,231
In the end, I hope that this
letter would not find your way.

352
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:01,903
If ever you are reading this will,

353
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,173
I haven't kept my promise.

354
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,177
The promise for you not to be worried,

355
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,613
the promise not to be hurt,

356
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,416
the promise not to die,

357
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,686
the promise that I would
come back for sure.

358
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:21,223
I haven't kept any of those.

359
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:23,759
I'm sorry.

360
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:29,998
In the place where you
are, it is always bright.

361
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,938
I met you.

362
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,442
And I loved you.

363
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,979
And for being apart from you,

364
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:46,815
I'm really sorry for that.

365
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,012
It's not true, right?

366
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:21,583
It's not true.

367
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:26,455
It's not true.

368
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,123
I'm sorry.

369
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,425
Dad, please.

370
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:34,062
Please.

371
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:39,701
You need to say it isn't true.
It's not true.

372
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,881
Seo Dae Young... wanted
to give this to you.

373
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:58,587
Don't. I don't want to.

374
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,024
I won't accept this.

375
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:09,197
If I read this... if I accept this...

376
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:13,735
then he's really dead.

377
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:21,409
This is all because of you.

378
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:25,580
You took all the time
we could've been happy.

379
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,710
I wasn't able to make up with him.

380
00:29:29,818 --> 00:29:32,921
I just said those harsh
words and sent him away.

381
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:37,926
This is an honorable
soldier's last words.

382
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,563
Keep it dearly.

383
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:44,733
I don't want to.

384
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:48,036
I said I don't want to.

385
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,432
Why are you here like this?

386
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,068
Why are you crying?

387
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:23,805
What will I do if you
are being like this?

388
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,877
I can't ask anything.

389
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,913
With what kind of mindset
did I come here?

390
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:35,217
What will I do if you
are being like this?

391
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,621
Didn't you say your father
is in a high position?

392
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,489
Did you check everything?

393
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,320
They could have been wrong!

394
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:44,993
They might have made a mistake!

395
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:47,395
Are you crying after
finding out everything?

396
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:52,033
Stop crying and answer
me, Yoon Myung Ju.

397
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:06,514
For real?

398
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:13,355
He really isn't coming?

399
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,859
I really won't see him?

400
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,796
Seriously?

401
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:24,366
He isn't coming?

402
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:13,915
I know it is shameless,

403
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:16,918
but I would like for you
not to cry for too long.

404
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,188
More than anyone else,

405
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:22,357
you have to live well and brightly.

406
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:24,859
And...

407
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:28,496
don't remember me for too long.

408
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:31,933
I am asking for a favor.

409
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:44,179
There will be an official announcement
in the army a week later.

410
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,317
The deaths of Captain Yoo Si Jin and
Sergeant First Class Seo Dae Young

411
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:53,188
will be wrapped up as a car
accident during training.

412
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:02,364
For safety regulation issues,

413
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:06,001
you must sign the confidentiality oath.

414
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,837
I ask for your cooperation.

415
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:17,645
Did his death

416
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:22,317
save someone's life?

417
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:24,919
Yes, it did.

418
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:32,961
Did his death...

419
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:38,333
protect the peace of some place?

420
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,271
Yes, it did.

421
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:46,107
Was his death...

422
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:50,078
for our country?

423
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,147
Yes.

424
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:55,250
It was.

425
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:57,919
Even then, his country...

426
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:03,591
makes me sign this document.

427
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:07,629
I am sorry.

428
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,501
Why is it so messed up?

429
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,539
Till the end...

430
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:20,775
why did you choose this kind of life?

431
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,180
Even your death has to be a
secret due to regulations.

432
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,820
I hope that what I am doing now is

433
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:38,159
what you want,

434
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:40,795
Yoo Si Jin.

435
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,669
I heard you've got your title back.

436
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,371
Very admirable, huh?

437
00:35:56,790 --> 00:36:01,142
As a friend, I congratulate you
for being promoted so fast.

438
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:06,970
I heard you're opposed to changing the blood
pressure medicine to Cosmo Pharmaceutical's.

439
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,200
The medicine now is cheap and good.

440
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:09,684
Why change it to the one that
is expensive and similar?

441
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,486
Please just change it.

442
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:14,722
Director Park from there is Dr. Park's
cousin, and my in-laws with my family.

443
00:36:14,722 --> 00:36:15,890
He's your aunt's husband.

444
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,560
That's why, if we change it,
everyone will be happy together.

445
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:20,929
I heard you will be
submitting a clinical report.

446
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:23,264
Why are you being cursed at
while doing all the hard work?

447
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,200
-Who cursed?
-Me.

448
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:26,834
Are you paying for the medicine?

449
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:30,320
If you really want to be Schweitzer so
badly, then go volunteer in a remote area.

450
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:33,050
In Africa, they don't have doctors,
so three people die every minute.

451
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,443
Hurry up if you want to save the world.

452
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,750
I heard that the doctor at
your office has no skill

453
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,581
and that 3 out of 4 of
the doctors misdiagnose.

454
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,416
You should meet a lawyer
at times like this

455
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,070
if you want to save
your medical license.

456
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:43,885
Hey!

457
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:48,022
Leave so I can eat my lunch comfortably.

458
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,891
Cheers.

459
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:56,497
It is good.

460
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,270
Drink slowly.

461
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,868
Why? When it is good.

462
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,404
Go home today.

463
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:05,740
How many days have you been
in the overnight room?

464
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:06,908
The interns are having a hard time.

465
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,776
Did they say they are having
a hard time because of me?

466
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:10,912
I didn't think of that.

467
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,948
I have a surgery in the morning.

468
00:37:13,948 --> 00:37:15,617
Stop going into the operating room.

469
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:19,187
I am the most sexy when I
am in the operating room.

470
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:27,362
What?

471
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,432
Nothing. I just thought of something.

472
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:32,967
What did you think of?

473
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:39,574
Just this and that.

474
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,878
Water.

475
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:45,880
Wine.

476
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:48,116
Candle.

477
00:37:49,617 --> 00:37:51,052
X-ray photo.

478
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,154
Hair ties.

479
00:37:56,557 --> 00:37:57,859
I am very crazy.

480
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,762
What is this? Why did you laugh?

481
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,330
Did you really go crazy?

482
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:05,033
I thought I was better, but.

483
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,570
I think I am really going crazy, Ji Soo.

484
00:38:15,677 --> 00:38:16,611
Should I give you a hug?

485
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:19,947
No.

486
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,516
Should I give you alcohol?

487
00:38:22,817 --> 00:38:23,518
Yeah.

488
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,925
You drink it all.

489
00:38:46,841 --> 00:38:50,560
I report to you, Sir! First Lieutenant
Yoon Myung Joo, as of November 31, 2015

490
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:53,590
has received an order to go to
the Taebaek Medical Unit in Urk.

491
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,384
This is my report. Power of unity.

492
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:01,189
Come back safely.

493
00:39:02,156 --> 00:39:03,424
Don't get sick this time.

494
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,126
I am sorry for making you worry.

495
00:39:06,227 --> 00:39:09,097
-You, too, don't get ill, Dad.
-Okay.

496
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:11,733
Thank you for giving me
a fair transfer order.

497
00:39:12,033 --> 00:39:13,267
The only order that was unjust was

498
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:16,504
just him alone.

499
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:19,173
Because of that my
daughter has been in agony

500
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:21,676
and it was a total failure of tactic.

501
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:25,713
I know you only think about that punk,

502
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:30,351
but I think about you.

503
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,654
In between thinking about him,

504
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,124
think of the father who
thinks of his daughter.

505
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,094
If you can forgive,

506
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:42,964
then please forgive.

507
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,579
Why are we here at a bar
on a broad daylight?

508
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:02,950
I am trying to get used to the time
difference since it's night over there.

509
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:06,854
I'm going to be
dispatched again.

510
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:10,391
You're lucky to go back to Urk.

511
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:11,959
Do you envy me going back there?
Do you want to go?

512
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:13,227
Should we?

513
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:17,465
Those guys are going together,
so why can't we go together?

514
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,034
You are so nonsensical.

515
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,375
This is a parting gift.

516
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,710
It was in the bunkhouse so I grabbed it.

517
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,848
This is Sergeant First
Class Seo's girlfriend.

518
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:38,286
That's Captain Yoo's comrade.

519
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,026
Its legs are so short.

520
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:47,662
First Lieutenant Yoon, you beat me.

521
00:40:50,231 --> 00:40:51,365
When are you leaving?

522
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:53,968
I depart on Monday at dawn.

523
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,804
I have three days left,

524
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,840
so should we also drink for
three days without sleep?

525
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:02,009
-Would you cooperate?
-Yes, I will cooperate.

526
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,360
Strangely, I've been thinking about
nothing but the good times I had lately.

527
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,696
I think about the things
that he didn't do for me.

528
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:29,470
By the way, I would like to know how Captain
Yoo and Sergeant First Class Seo met.

529
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:32,273
I was curious about how
they became so close,

530
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:33,841
but I didn't get a chance to ask.

531
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,410
And now I have nobody to ask about it.

532
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:37,745
I know the answer to that.

533
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:42,116
They first met because of a woman.

534
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:45,353
A woman?

535
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:53,928
I will do that.

536
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:56,864
At any rate, I feel a
bit strange though.

537
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,935
I have already completed
my mission for now,

538
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:04,338
so don't forget to tell Captain Yoo
that we are together now okay?

539
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,971
I am the commander here.

540
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,973
Why don't we share the
umbrella that you have?

541
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,008
We are dating.

542
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:44,712
You mean us?

543
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:49,250
I am dating First
Lieutenant Yoon Myung Ju.

544
00:42:56,770 --> 00:42:58,526
I am dating First
Lieutenant Yoon Myung Ju.

545
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,629
How long have you two dated?

546
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:03,064
We have dated for a year now.

547
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:07,301
When did you first see Myung Ju?

548
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:09,537
I first met her a month ago.

549
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:13,474
But you been together for a year?

550
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:16,978
I would like to make it clear that

551
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:19,347
I am dating the First
Lieutenant Yoon Myung Ju.

552
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:24,018
Do you know that Myung Ju's father has
three stars on him?

553
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:31,158
I think that anyone can make as
many as three mistakes as you live.

554
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:35,396
Her father being an ex-convict wouldn't
be an obstacle for our love.

555
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:37,932
I will tell you this again.

556
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:40,334
I am going out with the First
Lieutenant Yoon Myung Ju.

557
00:43:42,637 --> 00:43:44,130
I hope that you will
definitely date her.

558
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:45,439
I will definitely date her for sure.

559
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,243
We've been together for a year now.

560
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:51,345
Yeah, I know. I envy you.

561
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:55,216
Are you giving up?

562
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:01,522
Don't you think I would also find someone to date
for a year that I have only known for a month?

563
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:05,726
I don't think we will be
fighting over Myung Ju.

564
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:12,166
Let's be on the same
side when we do fight.

565
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:23,377
It feels good to drink during the day.

566
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:34,989
Do you know that we have never
said "I love you" to each other?

567
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,692
We did it with our actions
instead of with words.

568
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:43,064
We held hands and even kissed without
even saying "I love you" to one another.

569
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:45,330
Wow, that's amazing. How daring.

570
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:46,734
How could you just say anything?

571
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:48,135
There's something that I couldn't say.

572
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:50,071
Let's say something
that we couldn't say.

573
00:44:50,371 --> 00:44:52,540
Be fair and alphabetically.

574
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:54,308
You should go first since
your name is Kang Mo Yeon.

575
00:44:54,308 --> 00:44:56,310
The person that wants to hear
it should go first though.

576
00:44:56,450 --> 00:44:58,012
Nope. It's ladies first.

577
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:00,347
If not, then it will by age.

578
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,540
Why are you constantly trying
to get me to say it first?

579
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:03,690
You didn't say it either, Captain Yoo.

580
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,519
-I love you.
-Oh, you startled me.

581
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,556
I love you.

582
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:12,059
Roger that.

583
00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:15,396
I love you, too.

584
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,265
I will be loyal to you
with all that I have.

585
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:19,700
Okay.

586
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:22,069
Do you pledge to the flag?

587
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:23,037
Yes, Sir.

588
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,372
Power of unity.

589
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,176
Should I just put it
in the cup like that?

590
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,479
But it's a little too erotic.

591
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:35,683
Ah, this lady! It's still early
in the evening, you know.

592
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:54,802
What do you think of me?

593
00:45:56,650 --> 00:45:58,572
Am I pretty because of the backlight?

594
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:10,284
You are pretty every single moment.

595
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,307
I really missed you.

596
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:34,842
So did I.

597
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:39,547
But how come you didn't come?

598
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:41,715
Because I was protecting peace.

599
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:44,885
What about all the
promises you made to me?

600
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:49,523
They didn't mean anything to you at all?

601
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:51,325
I was going to come

602
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:55,529
with all my might.

603
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:00,467
I was going to come to you.

604
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:03,904
But you didn't come.

605
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:09,043
You didn't come.

606
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:23,651
I am not going to read it.

607
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,921
I am never going to read it
even till the day I die.

608
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:31,692
You should feel aggravated, too.

609
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:38,032
I just checked my bags
in and I'm on my way in.

610
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:43,971
No. I will be getting to
Albania through Abu Dhabi.

611
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:47,174
It will be very such a
long ride over there.

612
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:48,842
Doc Pyo, I am getting a
call on the other line.

613
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:51,278
I will give you a call once I get there.

614
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:53,914
Hello.

615
00:48:56,370 --> 00:48:57,251
Daniel?

616
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:00,788
When did you get here?

617
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:04,458
What are you doing here anyways? By
the way, what is this thing here?

618
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:07,027
I am here to do a protest,

619
00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:08,762
but I am prohibited from
entering the country.

620
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,298
They told me that it will be okay
as long as I don't cross the line,

621
00:49:11,298 --> 00:49:14,201
so I was going to camp out
here and protest by myself.

622
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:15,970
You are so cool.

623
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:19,606
I am an international criminal who is prohibited
to enter into twelve different countries.

624
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:22,242
Well, bad men are what
women fantasize about.

625
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:24,345
Dr. Kang, are you on vacation now?

626
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:25,746
I will be volunteering.

627
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:27,748
You mean for the
Albanian Refugee Camp?

628
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:29,917
Dr. Chi Hoon had left a message.

629
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:33,454
This thing called volunteering
can be quite addicting.

630
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,690
Rather than such a grandeur purpose, I
have an ulterior motive for doing this.

631
00:49:37,230 --> 00:49:40,461
Tomorrow is the anniversary for his death,
so I'm going there so I don't forget.

632
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:07,154
From polio and tuberculosis to AIDS,

633
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:09,656
which were considered
as incurable diseases,

634
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:13,260
many of these have been conquered
by the improvements of medicines.

635
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:16,260
However, 14 million
people are still dying

636
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:18,899
due to medicines, not diseases.

637
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,636
I met Daniel at the airport.

638
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:24,371
It was neat.

639
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:27,608
I'm blood type O.

640
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:31,912
I just suddenly thought of that, in
case you thought I was really a doll.

641
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:36,216
They said there's a
desert here somewhere.

642
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:38,719
Do you think there's an oasis, too?

643
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:41,989
You can't obtain a patent for the sun.

644
00:50:42,310 --> 00:50:44,992
Those were the words of Dr. Salk,
who created the polio vaccine.

645
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,560
You've been demanding withdrawal of patents
for vaccines for contagious diseases.

646
00:50:48,762 --> 00:50:51,999
Don't you think patent protection is necessary
in order to develop new medication?

647
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:55,436
Majority of international pharmaceutical
company's income is used for marketing.

648
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,405
If they are going to weaponize the vaccines
for epidemics in order to make money,

649
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:01,642
then pharmaceutical companies are no
different than narcotic drug rings.

650
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:03,777
This is what Nelson Mandela said.

651
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:05,946
Life is more important than profits.

652
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:10,284
I've realized that there is no
profit worth more than life.

653
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:15,255
This is the kind of doctor I've become.

654
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:19,960
Do I look praiseworthy
from where you're at?

655
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:25,230
I'll watch it for the next week,

656
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,167
so try not to use your
wrist if possible.

657
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:29,670
Yes, I understand.

658
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:34,608
Commanding officer, don't make him work.

659
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:40,214
Yes, I understand.

660
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:44,985
But aren't you going to eat?

661
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:47,354
I make a killer ramen.

662
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,220
Why did you come all the way here?

663
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:55,729
Sergeant Kim Ki Bum.

664
00:51:57,097 --> 00:51:58,532
I'm the army type.

665
00:52:03,804 --> 00:52:05,706
Sergeant First Class Seo ate
a lot of ramen, too, right?

666
00:52:07,608 --> 00:52:10,110
Yes, he enjoyed frequently.

667
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:14,781
Let's eat. It's good.

668
00:52:18,852 --> 00:52:21,021
But you know what?

669
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,090
It's snowing outside.

670
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:26,860
-Really?
-Wow, it's amazing.

671
00:52:27,461 --> 00:52:29,763
It doesn't usually snow in Urk.

672
00:53:20,747 --> 00:53:22,182
I can do it myself.

673
00:53:25,190 --> 00:53:29,122
Usually dating is when things that "I can
do myself" are done by the other person.

674
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:08,528
You always risk your life
like this, don't you?

675
00:54:10,364 --> 00:54:12,032
I'm a man who is good at his job.

676
00:54:12,866 --> 00:54:16,703
And a part of my job
is not getting killed.

677
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:22,943
Liar.

678
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:28,849
I won't get hurt. I won't die.

679
00:54:31,852 --> 00:54:34,321
I'll make sure to come back. I promise.

680
00:54:39,726 --> 00:54:43,430
Where do you get off lying?

681
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:46,700
I love you.

682
00:54:49,002 --> 00:54:50,404
Don't make me laugh.

683
00:54:51,638 --> 00:54:52,939
I don't believe you.

684
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:04,885
This is headquarters.

685
00:55:05,519 --> 00:55:07,120
Beauty, please come in.

686
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,691
Please bring some lidocaine
on your way back.

687
00:55:14,828 --> 00:55:18,065
This is Beauty. Be there soon. Over.

688
00:55:42,856 --> 00:55:44,524
Stay right here.

689
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,328
Big Boss transmitting.

690
00:56:11,918 --> 00:56:15,222
I keep hearing ridiculous things lately.

691
00:56:25,499 --> 00:56:26,867
Big Boss transmitting.

692
00:56:49,523 --> 00:56:52,726
Pretty One, turn around. Over.

693
00:57:18,919 --> 00:57:20,353
This can't be.

694
00:57:30,870 --> 00:57:32,432
I can't believe this.

695
00:57:34,430 --> 00:57:36,670
This can't be.

696
00:58:12,939 --> 00:58:14,307
It's been a really long time.

697
00:58:18,678 --> 00:58:19,379
You...

698
00:58:22,315 --> 00:58:24,017
You were alive?

699
00:58:26,453 --> 00:58:31,458
I keep achieving that difficult mission.

700
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:44,905
You were alive.

701
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:49,309
You were alive.

702
00:58:51,478 --> 00:58:52,479
I'm sorry.

703
00:58:56,150 --> 00:58:57,083
I'm sorry.
