1
00:02:08,388 --> 00:02:09,641
It seems like...

2
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,373
...we're just colliding
while we're passing by.

3
00:02:19,643 --> 00:02:20,579
Move aside.

4
00:02:20,927 --> 00:02:23,113
I will move when we clear up
the misunderstanding.

5
00:02:25,155 --> 00:02:27,175
What he told you, it's all true.

6
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:29,888
-That bastard...
-My patient's not your bastard.

7
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:39,338
Doctor, your patient...

8
00:02:39,832 --> 00:02:43,548
...stole my friend's cellphone,
so we came here to retrieve it.

9
00:02:44,338 --> 00:02:46,678
Then we saw him getting a
beat-down, so we helped.

10
00:02:46,763 --> 00:02:49,526
He saved the person who
stole his cellphone?

11
00:02:50,532 --> 00:02:52,884
Beating him to a pulp
would make more sense.

12
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:59,219
Hello, police? This is the ER
of Haesung Hospital...

13
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:16,863
"Emergency Call"

14
00:03:16,957 --> 00:03:17,790
"Call Ended"

15
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:20,388
What do you think you're doing?

16
00:03:20,473 --> 00:03:21,926
I'm going to be honest with you.

17
00:03:23,177 --> 00:03:24,871
The police will make things complicated.

18
00:03:25,685 --> 00:03:26,554
Right?

19
00:03:27,932 --> 00:03:29,117
Give me the cellphone.

20
00:03:31,437 --> 00:03:33,871
Actually, we are military officers.

21
00:03:34,177 --> 00:03:35,728
And we're on leave.

22
00:03:36,237 --> 00:03:38,914
It's going to be trouble if we're
involved in an assault incident.

23
00:03:38,999 --> 00:03:40,708
We have to write reports and stuff.

24
00:03:41,917 --> 00:03:43,421
I ask for your cooperation.

25
00:03:43,948 --> 00:03:45,796
Why should I cooperate with you?

26
00:03:46,254 --> 00:03:48,464
Why should I care if you're
a solider or a gangster?

27
00:03:48,984 --> 00:03:50,522
I told you to give me the phone.

28
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,027
It will take about five
minutes to find it.

29
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:55,185
-Please wait here.
-Okay.

30
00:04:23,386 --> 00:04:26,378
How do you know Myeongju?

31
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:29,982
We're friends from the Military Academy.

32
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:35,083
Did you have to check that
when you already confirmed my identity?

33
00:04:36,087 --> 00:04:37,831
I look like a terrible liar.

34
00:04:38,965 --> 00:04:41,032
Murderers usually look friendly.

35
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:47,003
That is somewhat true.

36
00:04:49,016 --> 00:04:50,942
It creeps me out to hear you
say that with a straight face.

37
00:04:51,026 --> 00:04:52,575
We're the only ones here.

38
00:04:52,989 --> 00:04:54,313
Don't worry.

39
00:04:54,749 --> 00:04:58,404
My code is to protect the beautiful,
the elderly, and the children.

40
00:04:58,489 --> 00:05:01,785
That's a relief, since I
fit into one of those.

41
00:05:02,216 --> 00:05:03,244
No, you don't.

42
00:05:03,482 --> 00:05:04,799
As an elder.

43
00:05:12,891 --> 00:05:16,636
So what's your real name, Big Boss?

44
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:20,195
I'm Yoo Shijin. What about you?

45
00:05:21,683 --> 00:05:22,916
I'm Kang Moyeon.

46
00:05:26,304 --> 00:05:27,194
Nice to meet you.

47
00:05:28,777 --> 00:05:30,228
Let's not get too friendly.

48
00:05:40,293 --> 00:05:41,629
The wound's sutured.

49
00:05:41,744 --> 00:05:44,886
Until we take the stitches
out next week...

50
00:05:44,971 --> 00:05:46,612
...you need to keep it sterilized.

51
00:05:47,005 --> 00:05:49,480
-There's a hospital in the army, right?
-Can I come here?

52
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,878
-Isn't this place far?
-It's far.

53
00:05:54,096 --> 00:05:55,305
Can I come everyday?

54
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,904
That would be too much.
Maybe three times a week?

55
00:05:58,119 --> 00:06:00,603
Or four times a week
for a faster recovery.

56
00:06:02,081 --> 00:06:03,275
Will you be my attending doctor?

57
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,033
Why is that important?
It's just cleaning the wound.

58
00:06:07,437 --> 00:06:08,503
Of course, it's important.

59
00:06:10,075 --> 00:06:10,908
Especially...

60
00:06:11,619 --> 00:06:12,991
...the attending doctor's looks.

61
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,928
If you're choosing a
doctor based on looks...

62
00:06:18,013 --> 00:06:19,698
...then there's no better option.

63
00:06:20,266 --> 00:06:22,425
I'll make a reservation. Come at 2 PM.

64
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:29,950
Doctors don't have boyfriends.

65
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:31,386
They're too busy.

66
00:06:34,243 --> 00:06:36,009
Soldiers don't have girlfriends.

67
00:06:36,917 --> 00:06:37,868
They're job's too intense.

68
00:06:40,211 --> 00:06:41,912
Who should answer the question?

69
00:06:58,173 --> 00:06:59,314
What are you doing here?

70
00:07:01,938 --> 00:07:05,325
I'm sorry, but I have to stand you up.

71
00:07:09,818 --> 00:07:10,986
It must be an emergency.

72
00:07:11,071 --> 00:07:13,069
-Let's go to the ground floor...
-No.

73
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:18,254
-It came to pick me up.
-You? Why?

74
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,341
Did a war break out?

75
00:07:24,413 --> 00:07:27,777
Not here, but somewhere else. Don't worry.

76
00:07:28,257 --> 00:07:30,609
Then why is there
a chopper to pick you up?

77
00:07:30,694 --> 00:07:32,209
I'll explain it to you later.

78
00:07:32,826 --> 00:07:34,370
Instead, promise me one thing.

79
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:37,140
Let's meet next weekend.

80
00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:38,944
Not at the hospital, but somewhere else.

81
00:07:39,207 --> 00:07:40,574
You're not going to come for treatment?

82
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:42,489
I'll come back in one piece, so...

83
00:07:43,817 --> 00:07:45,491
...let's watch a movie together.

84
00:07:51,877 --> 00:07:53,992
Hurry, I don't have time.

85
00:07:55,645 --> 00:07:56,874
Would you like to or not?

86
00:07:59,113 --> 00:08:00,069
I'd like to.

87
00:08:01,378 --> 00:08:02,715
You made a promise.

88
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,074
How have you been?

89
00:09:37,346 --> 00:09:38,810
Why are you here so early?

90
00:09:39,189 --> 00:09:41,673
Our appointment's not
for another two hours.

91
00:09:41,758 --> 00:09:43,227
Did I confuse the time?

92
00:09:44,453 --> 00:09:46,043
I came very early.

93
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:50,103
Waiting for someone is pretty fun.

94
00:09:50,595 --> 00:09:53,376
Still, who comes two hours early?

95
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:59,167
But... why do you keep
avoiding eye contact?

96
00:09:59,252 --> 00:10:01,010
It's a matter of self confidence.

97
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:03,115
I don't have any makeup on.

98
00:10:03,781 --> 00:10:06,689
I was going to wash my hair
and change my clothes at home.

99
00:10:08,345 --> 00:10:09,630
You're already beautiful.

100
00:10:10,462 --> 00:10:13,329
Really? Why is that?

101
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:15,658
Is it because I'm beautiful on the inside?

102
00:10:16,748 --> 00:10:18,318
Is it okay for you if I don't shower?

103
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,148
Get in. I'll give you a ride.

104
00:10:21,155 --> 00:10:22,541
I guess it's not okay.

105
00:10:40,901 --> 00:10:43,850
This is the most exciting
moment at a theater.

106
00:10:44,209 --> 00:10:45,688
Right before the lights go out.

107
00:10:49,338 --> 00:10:51,408
This is the most exciting
moment of my life.

108
00:10:51,713 --> 00:10:55,030
The lights are about to go out
when I'm with a beautiful woman.

109
00:10:56,565 --> 00:10:57,775
Not an elderly person?

110
00:10:59,152 --> 00:11:01,289
It's dark so I mistook you
for a beautiful woman.

111
00:11:08,503 --> 00:11:11,180
Before you called me "hey you," right?

112
00:11:12,161 --> 00:11:12,998
So?

113
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:16,096
How old are you?

114
00:11:16,707 --> 00:11:18,298
You know my age from looking at my chart.

115
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:23,792
You were the one who
teased me first... Big bro.

116
00:11:29,705 --> 00:11:31,201
So I am the older one.

117
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,796
That was a lie. I'm the older one.

118
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:38,308
I don't think so. Let me check your ID.

119
00:11:39,524 --> 00:11:41,424
I was worried that you might be a minor.

120
00:11:58,038 --> 00:11:58,871
Salute.

121
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:01,299
Captain Yoo Shijin.

122
00:12:03,096 --> 00:12:04,002
Yes, that's right.

123
00:12:06,128 --> 00:12:07,115
Yes, I understand.

124
00:12:07,985 --> 00:12:08,818
Salute.

125
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,011
Is something wrong?

126
00:12:13,548 --> 00:12:14,888
I have to go.

127
00:12:14,973 --> 00:12:15,855
Right now?

128
00:12:16,417 --> 00:12:19,430
Yes, I'm sorry.

129
00:12:22,632 --> 00:12:24,734
Are you standing me up again?

130
00:12:27,531 --> 00:12:28,982
I'm really sorry.

131
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,141
Let's watch this movie together next time.

132
00:12:31,337 --> 00:12:32,281
We should leave for now.

133
00:12:32,366 --> 00:12:35,335
No, I'll just watch. You can leave.

134
00:12:36,528 --> 00:12:39,535
-Next time is better...
-It's okay. You can go.

135
00:12:46,471 --> 00:12:47,498
I'll call you.

136
00:13:19,623 --> 00:13:21,500
I'm sorry about the other day.

137
00:13:23,018 --> 00:13:24,270
For leaving you like that.

138
00:13:25,673 --> 00:13:29,933
What I want to hear is
an explanation, not an apology.

139
00:13:31,866 --> 00:13:33,682
Where did you come back from this time?

140
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,375
Did you take a helicopter again?

141
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:40,371
No. I didn't go far.

142
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,741
I can't go into details
because of the rules.

143
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,553
I see.

144
00:13:50,101 --> 00:13:51,406
You're not a spy, right?

145
00:13:59,367 --> 00:14:01,322
It was a very hard day for me...

146
00:14:02,713 --> 00:14:06,373
...but you popped into my
thoughts from time to time.

147
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,494
I wondered, "Exactly where did
the man I was attracted to go?"

148
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,077
"What could he be doing?"

149
00:14:16,932 --> 00:14:18,669
But even when I meet you like this...

150
00:14:18,798 --> 00:14:23,182
...you're saying I can't
hear your story.

151
00:14:23,473 --> 00:14:24,432
Because of the rules.

152
00:14:28,732 --> 00:14:29,687
I'm sorry.

153
00:14:30,658 --> 00:14:33,785
Is it something like the special forces?

154
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,036
It's similar.

155
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,738
You said you do a lot of
shoveling in your unit.

156
00:14:40,241 --> 00:14:44,212
The fact that you have a gunshot
wound means you were shot.

157
00:14:45,005 --> 00:14:45,980
That means...

158
00:14:47,526 --> 00:14:49,545
...your work involves shooting guns.

159
00:14:51,383 --> 00:14:52,465
So...

160
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:58,703
...it's kill or be killed.

161
00:15:00,169 --> 00:15:03,263
That's the kind of work you do.

162
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:10,115
Do you only fight the bad guys?

163
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:20,288
Everyday, I spend more than 12 hours...

164
00:15:21,684 --> 00:15:24,021
...in the operating room
to save people's lives.

165
00:15:25,417 --> 00:15:26,913
That's what I do.

166
00:15:27,706 --> 00:15:29,366
Fighting to save lives.

167
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:33,110
But your fight...

168
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:38,554
...is to protect others through death.

169
00:15:47,901 --> 00:15:49,222
I'm a soldier.

170
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,473
A soldier acts according to commands.

171
00:15:59,623 --> 00:16:01,839
Sometimes my strongly held principle...

172
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:05,500
...may mean something else for others...

173
00:16:08,095 --> 00:16:10,571
...but I still do my best
to carry out the mission.

174
00:16:14,782 --> 00:16:15,805
Until now...

175
00:16:19,566 --> 00:16:21,904
...I've lost three of my
fellow soldiers in action.

176
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,791
We do this job because...

177
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,811
...someone has to do it...

178
00:16:32,265 --> 00:16:35,546
...to protect my family,
you and your family...

179
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:38,525
...and everyone else who is
dear to them.

180
00:16:43,173 --> 00:16:44,652
I believe...

181
00:16:45,961 --> 00:16:48,994
...that I fight for the peace
and freedom of the land we live in.

182
00:16:54,562 --> 00:16:55,826
I'm a doctor.

183
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:58,900
I believe in the sanctity of all life.

184
00:16:59,671 --> 00:17:02,658
And there is no greater
value or ideology than that.

185
00:17:08,325 --> 00:17:09,256
I see.

186
00:17:16,146 --> 00:17:17,319
I'm sorry, but...

187
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,037
...this wasn't the kind
of date I was hoping for.

188
00:17:25,731 --> 00:17:26,623
I understand.

189
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:28,959
I'll be on my way.

190
00:17:29,727 --> 00:17:30,817
It was a pleasure.

191
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:36,922
Goodbye.

192
00:18:03,202 --> 00:18:06,519
"Taebak Army Base in Urk"

193
00:18:13,335 --> 00:18:15,464
"8 Months Later"

194
00:18:23,446 --> 00:18:26,943
The next topic is about the
dispatch of medical corps to Urk.

195
00:18:27,876 --> 00:18:30,661
I thought about taking volunteers.

196
00:18:31,108 --> 00:18:33,259
But because we want to
send the very best...

197
00:18:33,523 --> 00:18:37,356
...I would like to appoint the face
of our hospital, professor Kang Moyeon...

198
00:18:39,501 --> 00:18:42,775
...as the leader of the volunteer team.

199
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:45,965
You'll take it, right, professor Kang?

200
00:18:57,934 --> 00:19:01,765
Company Mowuru will be in charge of
your safety during your stay in Urk.

201
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,645
I'm the commander, Captain Yoo Shijin.

202
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:06,962
-Welcome.
-Hello.

203
00:19:07,047 --> 00:19:09,719
We will be taking the
helicopter behind us...

204
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,230
...to reach our destination,
Mowuru airfield.

205
00:19:18,005 --> 00:19:19,951
The rest of your supplies
will be transported by land.

206
00:19:20,036 --> 00:19:21,944
You will receive them
by tomorrow evening.

207
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:26,662
We will be leaving in 10 minutes at 13:25.

208
00:20:26,827 --> 00:20:29,287
Did he not see me or
is he pretending not to?

209
00:20:49,244 --> 00:20:50,317
Did you think about me?

210
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:54,257
Of course. How about you?

211
00:20:54,445 --> 00:20:57,234
I thought about you a lot. Like a man.

212
00:21:00,306 --> 00:21:02,993
This is for decor,
since it is our first date.

213
00:21:03,078 --> 00:21:04,079
I'll put it over here.

214
00:21:04,164 --> 00:21:06,011
Why not put it in the middle?

215
00:21:06,997 --> 00:21:08,888
A woman looks better with backlighting.

216
00:21:08,973 --> 00:21:11,426
It needs to be here
for me to look pretty.

217
00:21:11,885 --> 00:21:13,110
Don't move.

218
00:21:13,284 --> 00:21:16,112
I calculated the angle of
your gaze before placing it.

219
00:21:20,051 --> 00:21:22,506
You got hurt again.

220
00:21:23,053 --> 00:21:25,169
Did you get hurt again
while using the shovel?

221
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:33,267
How often do you think people hurt
their faces while using a shovel?

222
00:21:34,137 --> 00:21:35,496
So it wasn't the shovel?

223
00:21:35,581 --> 00:21:37,329
It's difficult but I managed to do it.

224
00:21:45,963 --> 00:21:49,340
I guess you're so busy that
you can't even wash your hair?

225
00:21:50,222 --> 00:21:52,129
I practically live in the operating room.

226
00:21:53,743 --> 00:21:57,032
Do you know how sexy I look
in the operating room?

227
00:21:57,963 --> 00:22:01,846
Even if you can only see this
much, I'm really pretty.

228
00:22:03,909 --> 00:22:06,454
I wish I could date that person.

229
00:22:07,165 --> 00:22:08,348
She must not be here today.

230
00:22:09,106 --> 00:22:10,439
Seriously!

231
00:22:10,828 --> 00:22:12,885
Being with men all the time,
my jokes tend to get overboard.

232
00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:15,412
I'm very sorry.

233
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:18,998
I understand.

234
00:22:50,768 --> 00:22:54,346
I'm glad to see you again.

235
00:23:58,672 --> 00:24:00,802
I didn't expect to see this kind of place.

236
00:24:00,887 --> 00:24:02,424
How could there be such a place as this?

237
00:24:02,965 --> 00:24:04,480
It's just stunningly beautiful.

238
00:24:06,738 --> 00:24:07,744
Then we should come again.

239
00:24:15,873 --> 00:24:19,741
People of Urk believe that if you
take a pebble from this beach...

240
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,790
...you will be able to return
here no matter what.

241
00:24:26,076 --> 00:24:26,909
Here.

242
00:24:30,624 --> 00:24:31,949
You just made that up now, didn't you?

243
00:24:32,617 --> 00:24:35,858
If it was true, then there
wouldn't be any pebbles left.

244
00:24:37,337 --> 00:24:41,352
The people who returned put the
pebbles back where they found them.

245
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:47,458
It's a beautiful legend.

246
00:24:49,204 --> 00:24:50,445
And that ship is fascinating.

247
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:03,425
But how come this ship is here like this?

248
00:25:04,491 --> 00:25:05,337
It was bewitched.

249
00:25:06,413 --> 00:25:08,879
You end up like this when you're
bewitched by something beautiful.

250
00:25:13,406 --> 00:25:14,893
Have you ever been bewitched?

251
00:25:18,926 --> 00:25:19,759
I have.

252
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:22,855
You should know.

253
00:25:46,564 --> 00:25:47,397
Here.

254
00:25:56,196 --> 00:25:57,623
(EN) "Hands off."

255
00:25:59,481 --> 00:26:02,763
(EN) Only Arab doctors can operate
on President Mubarek.

256
00:26:19,414 --> 00:26:20,926
Everyone take your hands
off and step back.

257
00:26:25,229 --> 00:26:28,687
Fine. I'm not trying to
change history here.

258
00:26:29,465 --> 00:26:34,135
But as soon as I take my
hands off, he will die.

259
00:26:39,234 --> 00:26:40,738
His blood pressure is dropping.

260
00:26:44,173 --> 00:26:47,277
Listen carefully. It's not a matter
over whether he lives or dies.

261
00:26:47,423 --> 00:26:50,382
The point is who will
take responsibility.

262
00:26:50,989 --> 00:26:52,537
Do as the Arabs say.

263
00:26:52,686 --> 00:26:53,943
And if the patient dies...

264
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:58,026
...we can blame it on the surgeon's error.

265
00:26:59,121 --> 00:27:02,468
Our troops will not intervene.

266
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:04,358
It's an order.

267
00:27:16,541 --> 00:27:19,987
Can you save this patient?

268
00:27:20,484 --> 00:27:21,317
What?

269
00:27:23,339 --> 00:27:25,056
I have to open him up to be sure...

270
00:27:25,362 --> 00:27:26,703
...but there may be bleeding
in the biliary tract...

271
00:27:26,787 --> 00:27:28,215
Enough with the big words.

272
00:27:28,691 --> 00:27:30,889
Just tell me whether
you can save him or not.

273
00:27:31,468 --> 00:27:32,343
As a doctor.

274
00:27:35,973 --> 00:27:37,967
What the hell are you doing?!

275
00:27:38,052 --> 00:27:39,112
Answer me.

276
00:27:52,136 --> 00:27:53,377
I can save him.

277
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:03,936
Then save him.

278
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:26,261
We're moving the bed
to the operating room.

279
00:28:27,809 --> 00:28:31,349
Get back! I'm telling
you for the last time!

280
00:28:31,434 --> 00:28:33,681
From this moment, protecting the
medical team and the patient...

281
00:28:34,811 --> 00:28:36,325
...is our foremost concern.

282
00:28:37,472 --> 00:28:41,120
Everyone form a line in
front of the line of fire.

283
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:54,653
I will permit shooting anyone who
threatens my command from this point on.

284
00:28:55,043 --> 00:28:59,169
Look, Captain. You better know
exactly what you're doing.

285
00:28:59,893 --> 00:29:03,396
You do your job. The doctor
will save her patient.

286
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:06,914
And I will protect what I have to.

287
00:29:10,771 --> 00:29:12,025
We will mobilize.

288
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,611
"Taebak Headquarters in Urk"

289
00:29:52,704 --> 00:29:58,094
We can't give an official
punishment for your disobedience.

290
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:01,957
However, the disciplinary
committee has decided that...

291
00:30:02,108 --> 00:30:03,695
...we cannot ignore your actions.

292
00:30:03,941 --> 00:30:08,096
Therefore, we will hold you responsible
for not complying with the regulations...

293
00:30:08,261 --> 00:30:10,165
...during the bomb disposal on May 18th.

294
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,049
As a result, your punishment
will be three months of pay cut.

295
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:14,842
Do you have any objections?

296
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,190
No, sir.

297
00:30:16,274 --> 00:30:20,766
Also, you will be excluded from the
screening for promotion to Major.

298
00:30:21,266 --> 00:30:22,870
Do you have any objections to that?

299
00:30:22,955 --> 00:30:25,601
-No, sir.
-Good. That would be all.

300
00:30:26,414 --> 00:30:27,247
Salute!

301
00:30:28,627 --> 00:30:31,609
Look Doctor, this is not a court case.

302
00:30:31,694 --> 00:30:33,161
Don't you know what a
disciplinary action is?

303
00:30:37,352 --> 00:30:38,185
Salute!

304
00:30:40,208 --> 00:30:41,041
I apologize.

305
00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:42,392
Let's go.

306
00:30:55,942 --> 00:30:58,891
Excuse me, what are you doing?

307
00:31:01,689 --> 00:31:03,511
Why did you do something
completely reckless?

308
00:31:03,596 --> 00:31:06,853
Reckless? Because of me,
a person's life...

309
00:31:06,938 --> 00:31:08,483
It wasn't because of you.

310
00:31:10,029 --> 00:31:12,091
Do you think I did that
to save one woman?

311
00:31:16,306 --> 00:31:17,798
Do you remember when
we first met in Korea...

312
00:31:19,009 --> 00:31:20,967
...I had a gunshot wound on my body?

313
00:31:23,376 --> 00:31:25,507
On my first day as commander
in the special forces...

314
00:31:26,214 --> 00:31:27,543
...one of my superiors told me...

315
00:31:29,067 --> 00:31:31,102
"A soldier's life is
shrouded in winding sheets."

316
00:31:33,069 --> 00:31:35,648
"When you risk your life for your
country in an unknown battlefield..."

317
00:31:36,957 --> 00:31:40,988
"...where you die is your grave,
and your shroud is your uniform."

318
00:31:42,278 --> 00:31:44,337
"It takes that much determination
to wear that uniform."

319
00:31:45,704 --> 00:31:47,525
"And once you've put on that uniform..."

320
00:31:47,962 --> 00:31:50,550
"...be honorable at every moment,
there's no excuse for falling short."

321
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,351
I owe my life to that superior.

322
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:04,284
That gunshot wound was from that very day.

323
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,251
Every decision that I make,
no matter how big or small...

324
00:32:09,203 --> 00:32:12,315
...includes my comrades' honor,
glory, and their sense of duty.

325
00:32:13,078 --> 00:32:14,641
It wasn't any different that day.

326
00:32:14,726 --> 00:32:17,018
I made a decision
including all of those...

327
00:32:17,345 --> 00:32:19,042
...and I have no regrets to my decision.

328
00:32:19,987 --> 00:32:21,427
But that doesn't mean...

329
00:32:23,569 --> 00:32:25,811
...the fact that I broke the
military law can be neglected.

330
00:32:30,802 --> 00:32:32,829
What happened in the military
should be handled by the military.

331
00:32:32,913 --> 00:32:34,457
So you, Dr. Kang, should....

332
00:32:37,481 --> 00:32:38,757
...just leave it alone.

333
00:32:42,318 --> 00:32:43,548
Because my concern...

334
00:32:46,041 --> 00:32:47,579
...interfered your affairs...

335
00:32:50,534 --> 00:32:51,945
...I am truly sorry.

336
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:22,430
Reach into the ceiling
of the kitchen cupboard.

337
00:33:23,157 --> 00:33:25,255
No wage, no promotion...

338
00:33:25,601 --> 00:33:29,131
...I figured you could use
some booze on a day like this.

339
00:33:41,135 --> 00:33:43,249
What is the matter?

340
00:33:45,026 --> 00:33:46,498
I was going to drink some water.

341
00:33:47,369 --> 00:33:49,805
But why are you leaving without drinking?

342
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:53,445
It seemed like you wanted to be alone.

343
00:33:53,545 --> 00:33:56,430
No. I want to be together with you.

344
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,519
I've said that a few times.

345
00:34:00,028 --> 00:34:01,815
Don't go. Come over here.

346
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:16,767
How about wine instead of water?

347
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,435
Dispatched soldiers are
not allowed to drink.

348
00:34:40,038 --> 00:34:41,910
Didn't you take it out to drink it?

349
00:34:41,995 --> 00:34:43,415
I was going to, but...

350
00:34:44,246 --> 00:34:47,348
...my plan failed because
there's a witness now.

351
00:34:55,006 --> 00:34:59,116
I'm sorry for acting up earlier.

352
00:34:59,648 --> 00:35:01,354
I was going to apologize first.

353
00:35:02,246 --> 00:35:03,452
Let's just say we both did.

354
00:35:03,573 --> 00:35:04,767
You didn't though.

355
00:35:10,065 --> 00:35:11,682
Don't be alarmed.

356
00:35:12,265 --> 00:35:13,510
Did I go too far again?

357
00:35:14,233 --> 00:35:16,375
-What did you ride to get here?
-I ran.

358
00:35:17,516 --> 00:35:19,768
I'm the only one fast enough
to get here this quickly.

359
00:35:21,683 --> 00:35:24,684
But I saw you getting
out of a car earlier.

360
00:35:27,112 --> 00:35:27,970
You did?

361
00:35:30,174 --> 00:35:31,205
Then, why did you ask?

362
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:32,758
Because I wanted to hear your joke.

363
00:35:37,151 --> 00:35:38,637
You look good in that dress uniform.

364
00:35:40,237 --> 00:35:42,766
I shouldn't say that to someone who
just received disciplinary measures.

365
00:35:44,992 --> 00:35:48,152
How did you know that this
was a dress uniform?

366
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:49,758
Why wouldn't I know?

367
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:52,197
Women have fantasies about uniforms, too.

368
00:35:53,858 --> 00:35:55,573
That's why I became a soldier.

369
00:36:03,388 --> 00:36:04,415
Is it good?

370
00:36:05,017 --> 00:36:05,850
A bit.

371
00:36:07,292 --> 00:36:08,450
Do you like alcohol?

372
00:36:12,445 --> 00:36:16,544
I wanted to watch a movie
and have a drink with you.

373
00:36:16,803 --> 00:36:19,245
It could have been a perfect date.

374
00:36:20,944 --> 00:36:22,161
Did you watch the movie?

375
00:36:22,816 --> 00:36:23,665
No.

376
00:36:23,889 --> 00:36:26,659
Why didn't you watch it?

377
00:36:26,798 --> 00:36:31,839
Because it's a movie I was
going to watch with someone.

378
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,080
And then I thought...

379
00:36:35,671 --> 00:36:37,646
...the next time I watch
a movie with a guy...

380
00:36:38,375 --> 00:36:40,449
...I should avoid good movies.

381
00:36:41,424 --> 00:36:44,850
Articles were released for that movie
until it had ten million viewers...

382
00:36:46,628 --> 00:36:47,898
But for me...

383
00:36:49,863 --> 00:36:53,057
...that movie meant Yoo Shijin,
so it made me think about you.

384
00:37:05,216 --> 00:37:06,686
You look like you really
want to drink this.

385
00:37:12,194 --> 00:37:13,720
It's not like there isn't another way.

386
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,511
Sleep well.

387
00:38:27,463 --> 00:38:28,927
Since you let me have this.

388
00:38:36,282 --> 00:38:38,216
"Big Boss"

389
00:39:06,284 --> 00:39:08,983
Oh no! What do I do?

390
00:39:09,969 --> 00:39:12,158
Hello? Hello?

391
00:39:13,118 --> 00:39:14,240
Captain Yoo?

392
00:39:14,838 --> 00:39:16,314
You take orders well, Dr. Kang.

393
00:39:16,399 --> 00:39:17,535
You borrowed a car.

394
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,294
My work is done and I'm about to leave.

395
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:24,913
Save me! Please save me!

396
00:39:25,092 --> 00:39:26,000
Where are you?

397
00:39:28,001 --> 00:39:30,345
What do you see right now?
Tell me whatever you see.

398
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:33,775
The car... The car
is stuck on the cliff.

399
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,486
Hold on. I'm on my way.

400
00:39:36,236 --> 00:39:37,168
I'll find you.

401
00:39:48,473 --> 00:39:52,081
Hello? Hello? Shijin?

402
00:39:52,569 --> 00:39:53,845
Please don't hang up.

403
00:39:57,143 --> 00:39:58,332
Save me!

404
00:39:59,338 --> 00:40:02,742
Is anyone there? Please save me!

405
00:40:06,248 --> 00:40:10,934
So mom, don't cancel the pension
insurance or the savings account.

406
00:40:11,469 --> 00:40:13,387
Put in the rest of the money
and you take it all, okay?

407
00:40:13,727 --> 00:40:16,765
I am really sorry for being
mean all the time.

408
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:19,354
I love you, Mom.

409
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:35,406
-Shijin!
-Don't move.

410
00:40:36,232 --> 00:40:37,255
Open all the windows.

411
00:40:42,635 --> 00:40:43,894
Why are you coming to the front?

412
00:40:43,979 --> 00:40:46,225
You're pushing it further, we'll fall!

413
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:47,658
Lean back.

414
00:40:49,333 --> 00:40:50,665
The ground can't last anymore.

415
00:40:51,697 --> 00:40:52,905
I'm going to make this car fall.

416
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:55,528
-What? No way.
-Look at me.

417
00:40:56,529 --> 00:40:58,856
-I can't do this!
-Look at me, Dr. Kang!

418
00:41:00,472 --> 00:41:03,916
Trust me and hold my hand tight.

419
00:41:05,331 --> 00:41:06,731
Just close your eyes for a moment.

420
00:41:08,287 --> 00:41:10,087
I will save you. I promise.

421
00:41:11,153 --> 00:41:12,159
I don't want to.

422
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:16,808
-Take your foot off the brake.
-No! I can't do this!

423
00:41:38,291 --> 00:41:41,698
The medical team is on
channel seven so you can use that.

424
00:41:42,092 --> 00:41:43,388
Channel three is for our troop.

425
00:41:45,855 --> 00:41:49,690
If you want to speak, press
this button and wait for a second.

426
00:41:52,625 --> 00:41:55,537
"This is Big Boss, calling for
medical team support. Over."

427
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:56,841
Like this.

428
00:41:56,925 --> 00:42:00,031
-Is Big Boss your nickname?
-It's a call sign.

429
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:01,123
Have you decided on one?

430
00:42:01,208 --> 00:42:04,805
Not yet. I....

431
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:05,723
Beauty?

432
00:42:06,612 --> 00:42:07,875
You must be crazy.

433
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,790
-You look similar.
-What?

434
00:42:10,266 --> 00:42:12,769
You mean I'm not a beauty
but I look similar to one?

435
00:42:13,412 --> 00:42:14,994
-Occasionally.
-Occasionally?

436
00:42:15,403 --> 00:42:16,236
Jeez.

437
00:42:18,447 --> 00:42:19,420
Seriously.

438
00:42:20,598 --> 00:42:22,953
May I interrupt your good time?

439
00:42:25,367 --> 00:42:27,849
Why are you here? Weren't you
deployed to the headquarters?

440
00:42:29,342 --> 00:42:30,893
I came here to marry you.

441
00:42:31,521 --> 00:42:34,289
Don't make jokes like that.

442
00:42:34,765 --> 00:42:37,171
Did I just make you nervous?

443
00:42:37,538 --> 00:42:38,427
Wow!

444
00:42:41,757 --> 00:42:43,168
I officially report to you.

445
00:42:43,304 --> 00:42:45,885
As of 2015, May 28th,
I, Lieutenant Yoon Myeongju...

446
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:48,752
...have been ordered to join
Medicube of Mowuru Company.

447
00:42:48,837 --> 00:42:50,137
Here to report for duty

448
00:42:50,866 --> 00:42:51,699
Salute.

449
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:57,949
I'm sensing that you pulled some
strings for your transfer.

450
00:42:58,295 --> 00:43:02,085
It's not easy to live in conflict
with the injustice that favors me.

451
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:05,981
I'll leave you to talk.

452
00:43:07,997 --> 00:43:10,102
You should at least say
hi before you leave.

453
00:43:12,268 --> 00:43:14,866
We're here now.
Let bygones be bygones.

454
00:43:18,011 --> 00:43:19,459
I don't have any spare hand to shake.

455
00:43:19,913 --> 00:43:21,157
Nor am I willing to forget.

456
00:43:30,583 --> 00:43:31,792
You're here.

457
00:43:31,972 --> 00:43:33,403
Over here, sir.

458
00:43:38,646 --> 00:43:40,660
A cake? What's the occasion?

459
00:43:40,745 --> 00:43:41,761
Sit over here, Doctor.

460
00:43:42,064 --> 00:43:43,887
I was about to go get you anyway.

461
00:43:43,978 --> 00:43:45,630
-It's farewell party.
-I see.

462
00:43:45,715 --> 00:43:47,064
Who's farewell party?

463
00:43:47,403 --> 00:43:49,002
For the commander.

464
00:43:49,633 --> 00:43:50,985
If it's the commander, then...

465
00:43:54,042 --> 00:43:55,409
Captain Yoo?

466
00:43:55,494 --> 00:43:58,883
Yes. His service time is done
so he is leaving tomorrow.

467
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,786
I am going back to Korea tomorrow.

468
00:44:08,922 --> 00:44:10,182
I heard that you already know.

469
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:12,593
I heard.

470
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:18,528
I was the last person in
this camp to find out.

471
00:44:19,891 --> 00:44:23,632
I was going to tell you
yesterday but you ran away.

472
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:25,043
Do you remember?

473
00:44:26,086 --> 00:44:27,541
Then you should have held on to me.

474
00:44:28,101 --> 00:44:31,067
You saved Private Ryan, but
you can't even hold on to me?

475
00:44:31,152 --> 00:44:33,227
I'm not so sure, but...

476
00:44:34,715 --> 00:44:37,559
...you being angry means that the
tables have turned over to my side.

477
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:40,594
-Am I right?
-You're wrong.

478
00:44:45,587 --> 00:44:49,502
Are you feeling confused, as always?

479
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:55,152
I see.

480
00:44:57,175 --> 00:44:58,559
Then let me ask you one thing.

481
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:01,004
Since this could be the last time.

482
00:45:04,967 --> 00:45:06,539
When I kissed you without permission...

483
00:45:06,624 --> 00:45:09,123
-Don't bring that up unless I...
-What should I do?

484
00:45:12,463 --> 00:45:13,804
Should I apologize...

485
00:45:16,106 --> 00:45:17,253
...or confess my love?

486
00:45:28,421 --> 00:45:31,731
You are really charming, Shijin.

487
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:37,384
You are charming but dangerous.

488
00:45:38,353 --> 00:45:39,885
I don't like the dangerous part.

489
00:45:41,243 --> 00:45:43,794
But every time our eyes meet,
I am charmed.

490
00:45:46,053 --> 00:45:50,123
That's why I wish there was more time.

491
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:55,746
So I can uncomplicate my thoughts
and get rid of the fears.

492
00:45:56,854 --> 00:45:58,110
And take the time to think...

493
00:45:59,243 --> 00:46:02,114
...about becoming the
girlfriend of this...

494
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:04,289
...dangerous yet charming man.

495
00:46:07,842 --> 00:46:09,500
But then...

496
00:46:10,629 --> 00:46:12,780
...you always leave like this.

497
00:46:13,957 --> 00:46:16,458
I can't argue with you for leaving...

498
00:46:17,005 --> 00:46:19,310
...nor can I ask you not to leave.

499
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:24,259
I feel like a fool for
keeping it all to myself.

500
00:46:26,286 --> 00:46:27,575
And right now...

501
00:46:30,728 --> 00:46:32,477
...I just hate you.

502
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,382
Apologize.

503
00:46:37,028 --> 00:46:38,264
I will accept your apology.

504
00:46:47,372 --> 00:46:48,322
I'm sorry.

505
00:46:49,234 --> 00:46:50,819
I hope all is well with you.

506
00:46:53,213 --> 00:46:54,046
Salute.

507
00:47:15,277 --> 00:47:16,534
You're coming home soon, right?

508
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:19,987
Hurry. I got some good wine.

509
00:47:20,839 --> 00:47:22,470
I don't drink with girls.

510
00:47:23,392 --> 00:47:26,456
Get a man too. A good one.

511
00:47:26,792 --> 00:47:28,736
What about the guy you met
halfway across the world?

512
00:47:28,903 --> 00:47:30,156
Second time's not the charm?

513
00:47:35,833 --> 00:47:39,040
No. He was the best.

514
00:47:40,745 --> 00:47:42,518
I shouldn't have accepted his apology.

515
00:47:42,832 --> 00:47:44,510
I should have ran and held on...

516
00:47:44,988 --> 00:47:46,553
...to confess my love.

517
00:47:48,256 --> 00:47:50,283
I'm the one who missed
all those opportunities.

518
00:47:51,328 --> 00:47:53,294
He would have lost all interest in me.

519
00:49:09,811 --> 00:49:12,600
Oh, no. What is going on?

520
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:02,647
Get out of the way!

521
00:50:09,973 --> 00:50:12,453
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay. Please help the patient.

522
00:50:13,001 --> 00:50:15,498
Sir, can you hear me?

523
00:50:15,583 --> 00:50:18,613
No external bleeding. He has pulse,
but is unconscious.

524
00:50:18,998 --> 00:50:20,401
He's in temporary shock.

525
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:22,279
Supply him with oxygen
while I give an IV.

526
00:50:22,364 --> 00:50:23,197
Yes.

527
00:50:37,047 --> 00:50:41,345
I've been given the
permission to be a doctor...

528
00:50:42,792 --> 00:50:48,311
...I faithfully pledge to give my life to serve humanity..

529
00:50:48,562 --> 00:50:50,162
Medical team! Medical team!

530
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:52,933
Doctor, it's an emergency.

531
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:58,393
The health and life of my
patients will be my priority..

532
00:51:00,410 --> 00:51:07,079
Regardless of their race,
religion or nationality...

533
00:51:08,129 --> 00:51:11,087
...I will faithfully carry out
my duties towards my patients.

534
00:51:12,965 --> 00:51:14,249
Heave!

535
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:15,486
One, two!

536
00:51:15,585 --> 00:51:16,840
Heave!

537
00:51:16,925 --> 00:51:18,021
One, two!

538
00:51:18,494 --> 00:51:20,372
Even when I'm under threat...

539
00:51:21,641 --> 00:51:25,610
...I will not use my knowledge
inhumanely.

540
00:51:29,247 --> 00:51:34,071
I hereby take this oath on my account...

541
00:51:35,835 --> 00:51:38,144
...and on behalf of my honor.

542
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,747
Is he a survivor? Should I
wake up the medical team?

543
00:52:03,554 --> 00:52:04,754
"Number of Deaths 13"

544
00:52:08,692 --> 00:52:12,754
"Power Plant Salvage Status"

545
00:53:42,103 --> 00:53:44,671
Attention!

546
00:53:46,216 --> 00:53:48,595
Salute to the commander!

547
00:53:49,096 --> 00:53:50,391
Salute!

548
00:53:52,488 --> 00:53:53,321
Salute.

549
00:54:01,082 --> 00:54:02,197
Thank you all for your hard work.

550
00:54:04,132 --> 00:54:06,496
-Is anyone injured?
-No, sir!

551
00:54:08,256 --> 00:54:09,089
Good.

552
00:54:09,658 --> 00:54:13,374
We'll begin the rescue
mission of the power plant.

553
00:54:13,569 --> 00:54:15,922
There's only one thing to keep
in mind during the mission.

554
00:54:17,591 --> 00:54:19,175
Do not get hurt.

555
00:54:23,772 --> 00:54:24,605
Understand?

556
00:54:24,890 --> 00:54:26,196
Yes, sir!

557
00:54:26,693 --> 00:54:29,518
That would be all. Back to your positions.

558
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:30,856
To position!

559
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:54,106
It's a good thing that you're safe.

560
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:55,956
I was really worried about you.

561
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:58,613
I should go now.

562
00:55:00,678 --> 00:55:01,815
Sergeant Major Seo.

563
00:55:08,952 --> 00:55:12,218
Do not get hurt. That's an order.

564
00:55:13,498 --> 00:55:17,164
Protect it with your life. Understand?

565
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:43,712
I was hoping that you weren't hurt.

566
00:56:50,202 --> 00:56:51,642
I regretted it this whole time.

567
00:56:53,399 --> 00:56:55,200
Leaving that morning
without seeing your face.

568
00:56:57,402 --> 00:56:58,638
I can't stay by your side.

569
00:57:00,171 --> 00:57:01,087
So, please...

570
00:57:04,221 --> 00:57:05,252
...be safe.

571
00:57:05,970 --> 00:57:07,124
You, too, Captain.
