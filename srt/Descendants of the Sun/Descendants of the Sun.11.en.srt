1
00:00:03,704 --> 00:00:06,106
They really are bloody diamonds.

2
00:00:07,608 --> 00:00:09,309
Are they real?

3
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:12,212
How much do you think they're worth?

4
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:14,815
We're the only ones who
know how many there are.

5
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:18,519
-Do you want to take one each?
-I never thought you'd be like this.

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,521
You're a wise woman.

7
00:00:24,806 --> 00:00:26,226
But what if we...

8
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:29,630
...really got infected?

9
00:00:30,004 --> 00:00:31,331
Are you afraid?

10
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,550
Aren't you afraid?

11
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:37,337
I've told you before...

12
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:39,950
what is it that I'm most afraid of.

13
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,410
But compared to his job,

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,950
I'm just afraid to be away from him.

15
00:00:46,524 --> 00:00:49,383
So there's nothing to worry about
for me since we are together now.

16
00:01:09,573 --> 00:01:10,737
Are you insane?

17
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,350
Get out of here. I'm under quarantine.

18
00:01:27,013 --> 00:01:28,138
It's me, isn't it?

19
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,498
I have to admit, this is a bit scary.

20
00:01:46,138 --> 00:01:47,018
Captain Yoo,

21
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:51,211
please take this man outside.

22
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:53,513
I'm not going anywhere.

23
00:01:55,994 --> 00:01:57,417
I'm going to stay here.

24
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:01,388
I'm going to stay here with you.

25
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:15,150
I've been confirmed as a patient.

26
00:02:16,147 --> 00:02:18,438
And you need to be quarantined
for making contact.

27
00:02:25,652 --> 00:02:27,347
It's my diagnosis as a doctor,

28
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,551
and my order as a soldier.

29
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,505
Please leave.

30
00:02:50,692 --> 00:02:52,506
What will happen to Myeongju?

31
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,729
I heard that the fatality
rate is more than 50 percent.

32
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:59,513
I heard that it is worse
than the Ebola virus.

33
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:00,830
Is it true?

34
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:02,732
Yes, it's true.

35
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:04,351
Will she die?

36
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:05,936
Or will she live?

37
00:03:06,632 --> 00:03:08,648
There is no 100 percent
in medical science.

38
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:10,235
However,

39
00:03:10,536 --> 00:03:13,527
for young and healthy
patients like Lieutenant Yoon,

40
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,363
the fatality rate decreases sharply.

41
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,480
Since they have a high level of immunity.

42
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,537
Thank you.

43
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:26,139
A cytokine storm?

44
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,226
Isn't it a good thing to
be young and healthy,

45
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:29,643
since you have a high level of immunity?

46
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,145
It's ironic,

47
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:35,522
but having a high level of
immunity can cause a problem, too.

48
00:03:35,603 --> 00:03:37,017
Then what do we do?

49
00:03:38,292 --> 00:03:39,920
Is there no way?

50
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,990
I'll try everything
possible to help fight it.

51
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:47,010
I'll try my best not to lose against it.

52
00:03:48,215 --> 00:03:51,898
Fighting against a virus
is a doctor's battle.

53
00:03:54,024 --> 00:03:56,236
I'm reassured to have
such a reliable comrade.

54
00:03:59,954 --> 00:04:02,743
A patient has been confirmed
with the M3 virus.

55
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:06,036
Thus, we will designate Medicube
as the base medical Centre...

56
00:04:06,117 --> 00:04:07,914
...for treating the M3 virus.

57
00:04:08,075 --> 00:04:11,985
The intensive care ward will
be used as the isolation ward.

58
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,787
Under the supervision
of the medical staff,

59
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:16,857
if we follow quarantine rules and
take care of our personal hygiene,

60
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,592
we can prevent additional infection.

61
00:04:18,673 --> 00:04:19,788
We shouldn't be off our guard, but...

62
00:04:19,869 --> 00:04:22,062
There's no need to be afraid.

63
00:04:22,257 --> 00:04:26,366
This is a hospital, and there are
patients that we need to treat here.

64
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,585
Do not falter, and regarding
our task

65
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:30,470
-just do your best.
-Just do your best.

66
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:38,044
"Descendants of The Sun
Episode 11"

67
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:44,233
What are you going to
do with your laptop?

68
00:04:44,344 --> 00:04:47,150
It's going to be boring.
I'll play computer games.

69
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:50,924
I'm going to use all my game items.

70
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:52,618
There's no need to be frugal now.

71
00:04:52,737 --> 00:04:54,427
38.7°C.

72
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,150
You're fever isn't going down.

73
00:04:57,221 --> 00:04:58,532
This will sting a bit.

74
00:04:59,276 --> 00:05:01,802
You were always great at drawing blood.

75
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:05,272
-You draw it out from your first go.
-I wasn't like that from the beginning.

76
00:05:05,716 --> 00:05:07,474
It was only after practicing...

77
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:10,377
on a doctor friend when
I was a student nurse.

78
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:11,678
You remember.

79
00:05:13,456 --> 00:05:14,844
I'm always grateful to it,

80
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:16,316
every time I draw blood.

81
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:18,568
Press it hard.

82
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:23,056
Why are you so gentle today?

83
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:24,850
Because I might die?

84
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,127
Do you think I'll be tested positive?

85
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:33,533
In my opinion, you just have a cold.

86
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,318
And your symptom is exaggerating pain.

87
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:37,704
Call me when you're sick.

88
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,509
What if I miss you?

89
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,810
I'll be back before then.

90
00:06:04,929 --> 00:06:07,552
You must be very bored inside there.

91
00:06:11,762 --> 00:06:13,373
I'm sorry for being here...

92
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:15,041
at a time like this.

93
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:17,544
If you're sorry, get out safely.

94
00:06:17,988 --> 00:06:19,789
I won't mind you making trouble.

95
00:06:19,915 --> 00:06:21,838
So just be healthy.

96
00:06:23,981 --> 00:06:25,880
How is Myeongju doing?

97
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:27,783
Is she all right?

98
00:06:27,878 --> 00:06:30,006
She's still a doctor, not a patient.

99
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,693
She's busy checking
Mr. Jin and herself.

100
00:06:36,719 --> 00:06:38,431
How about you? Are you all right?

101
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:40,850
Please tell her that I'm okay...

102
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,637
and she doesn't need to worry about me.

103
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:45,405
It's channel number three.

104
00:06:51,606 --> 00:06:53,213
You can talk to her.

105
00:06:53,792 --> 00:06:55,615
I'm repaying you for...

106
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:57,717
...helping me talk to
Doctor Kang last time.

107
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:00,720
Thank you.

108
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:02,722
I'm leaving.

109
00:07:15,231 --> 00:07:16,836
This is Yoon Myeongju speaking.

110
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,839
Sergeant Major Seo Daeyeong, answer me.

111
00:07:28,618 --> 00:07:29,716
Roger.

112
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:30,834
Hey.

113
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:33,219
It's Seo Daeyeong.

114
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:36,122
How are you doing?

115
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,150
I miss you.

116
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,468
Have you ate?

117
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:50,870
I miss you.

118
00:07:56,329 --> 00:07:58,044
How are you feeling?

119
00:08:03,841 --> 00:08:04,968
You are a fool.

120
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:07,354
I already told you the answer.

121
00:08:10,768 --> 00:08:12,092
I miss you.

122
00:08:23,928 --> 00:08:24,938
Have you...

123
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:27,223
...ate?

124
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,643
I miss you.

125
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,769
I know you do.

126
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,524
Are you crying?

127
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,165
Do you remember?

128
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:55,368
The white dress I wore...

129
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:57,680
...on our second meeting?

130
00:08:58,429 --> 00:09:00,140
You asked me,

131
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,342
if my concept was virgin ghost.

132
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:07,210
I keep thinking about that moment.

133
00:09:07,407 --> 00:09:09,482
It seems like that was a foreshadow.

134
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:12,585
I will really become a
virgin ghost if I die now.

135
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,287
And it feels so unfair.

136
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,725
You are an angel.

137
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:22,796
From the moment I met you,

138
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:28,201
you've been an angel
to me this whole time.

139
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:31,538
I want you to know that.

140
00:09:39,131 --> 00:09:41,147
You are so sweet when I'm sick.

141
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:47,420
But what's the difference...

142
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,223
...between a ghost and an angel?
They're both dead anyway.

143
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:20,720
Medicube will be segregated
until we get the test results.

144
00:10:21,449 --> 00:10:24,958
We are treating the outpatients
in a makeshift clinic.

145
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:28,361
When will we be getting
the vaccine we asked for?

146
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,047
I made an urgent request for that
to the head office last night.

147
00:10:31,134 --> 00:10:32,966
It will arrive tomorrow at the latest.

148
00:10:33,142 --> 00:10:36,736
Did you get to track the patient
zero and others contacts?

149
00:10:36,912 --> 00:10:41,007
We got the list of contacts
of Jin Yeongsoo and...

150
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:44,427
handed it over to the UN forces
for quarantine and examination.

151
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:46,496
-Here's the list of contacts.
-Stop right there.

152
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:49,282
Just stand there. Stay behind the desk.

153
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:52,986
What about Lieutenant Yoon?

154
00:10:53,169 --> 00:10:54,287
How is she doing?

155
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:56,039
-She looks okay.
-Does she?

156
00:10:56,963 --> 00:10:59,976
Okay. Send her to the US military
hospital as soon as possible.

157
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,634
We made a request for cooperation,
so we should send her when we can.

158
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:07,834
Medicube is the fixed medical
treatment facility for the M3 virus.

159
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:10,170
-We can't send patients anywhere.
-Do you think I don't know that?

160
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:11,571
Hey.

161
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,832
Just move her before things get worse.

162
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:16,721
We are just following
the reaction manual.

163
00:11:16,824 --> 00:11:18,711
Don't you want to go back home?

164
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,883
Do you want to live here forever?

165
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:26,186
It is a war against an epidemic
which we can't see with our eyes.

166
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,389
It's an enemy we've never encountered
before, and this is an actual battle.

167
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:30,973
If we don't follow the rules,

168
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,593
we can't win the battle.

169
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:37,363
Why are you being so stubborn
on sticking to the manual today?

170
00:11:38,963 --> 00:11:40,066
Fine, do as you planned.

171
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,467
But...

172
00:11:42,595 --> 00:11:45,531
I won't be able to go back home
if any one of you get sick.

173
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:47,290
Make sure not to get sick.

174
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:48,286
Understood?

175
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:49,375
Yes, Sir.

176
00:11:50,741 --> 00:11:51,444
Salute.

177
00:11:52,589 --> 00:11:56,184
At the Mowuru area, which recently
suffered from an earthquake,

178
00:11:56,303 --> 00:11:59,085
two Koreans are confirmed
to have been infected...

179
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,793
...with M3 virus, a contagious disease.

180
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,508
One male and one female patient
are confirmed to be infected.

181
00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:08,090
-I'm calling Moyeon.
-I'm calling Dr. Song.

182
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:10,196
Why isn't she answering my call?

183
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:12,599
His cellphone is off.

184
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,834
-Hello?
-Did Chihoon answer his phone?

185
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:18,137
Mother, it's me.

186
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:20,323
Did you saw the news?

187
00:12:22,299 --> 00:12:24,811
This time, it's a contagious disease.

188
00:12:25,546 --> 00:12:30,184
Why didn't they come back
when I sent them a flight?

189
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,751
So now you're upset?

190
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,686
I'm already dying inside.

191
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:36,289
-You are here.
-Yes, I'm here.

192
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:39,392
You're not doing anything,
so I came to you.

193
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:42,462
Do you think you have time
to have a vain discussion?

194
00:12:42,681 --> 00:12:44,483
Aren't you going to fly to
Urk in a chartered plane?

195
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:47,685
Why should I go there? There's a
disease spreading around that area.

196
00:12:47,788 --> 00:12:48,844
What did you say?

197
00:12:48,939 --> 00:12:50,637
Aren't you worried about your family?

198
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,939
How can you call yourself the
director of this hospital?

199
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:56,225
How can you send my son
to a place like that?

200
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,912
Bring him back right in front
of me within 24 hours.

201
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:02,399
Hang on. Get off me and
let's talk about it calmly.

202
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,189
What are you doing? Stop her.

203
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:05,618
Well...

204
00:13:06,138 --> 00:13:09,355
How can you say that to my precious
daughter-in-law? She's pregnant.

205
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,258
I think I'm a widow now.

206
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,362
Did you hear that? You are fired.

207
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:18,080
I'm going to cut ties
with your mother, too.

208
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:19,365
She's not my friend any more.

209
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,567
Gosh. Hang on.

210
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:24,270
I will bring him back. I will.

211
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:25,822
I will bring him myself.

212
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:27,440
Would you feel much better...

213
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,942
...if I bring him back by tomorrow?

214
00:13:30,538 --> 00:13:31,944
By tomorrow. Okay?

215
00:13:32,155 --> 00:13:33,079
No?

216
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,165
Doctor Pyo, it's me. I need a favour.

217
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:40,153
I'm looking for some old materials
that I can't find online.

218
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:42,329
There's too much to scan.

219
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:44,123
I'll just have to take
pictures and send them over.

220
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,316
What are all of these?

221
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,522
Wow, do doctors study
even when they are sick?

222
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:18,574
Soldiers go to war even when
they are sick, don't they?

223
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,250
That's right.

224
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:24,731
Do you want to eat something?

225
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,432
Do you want something else to eat?

226
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:30,002
No. I just want to know more about
this virus. That's why I'm eating.

227
00:14:30,101 --> 00:14:32,605
It requires physical strength.

228
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:36,093
If I were a soldier,

229
00:14:36,196 --> 00:14:38,211
this would be a war.

230
00:14:40,371 --> 00:14:41,514
Anyway, the dinner was good.

231
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:42,915
Thank you.

232
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,918
I hope you will win the war. Salute.

233
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,372
Can he survive?

234
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:11,344
Fortunately, he came around.

235
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:13,212
But his breathing isn't stable yet.

236
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:15,433
The following 2 to 3 three
days will be critical for him.

237
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,750
They found diamonds in his stomach.

238
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,318
He had this much inside.

239
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,723
So I was right. That's what I saw.

240
00:15:23,921 --> 00:15:24,624
Excuse me.

241
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:27,059
How much would this much cost?

242
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:31,531
There were about 30 pieces of
2-carat-diamond of the first water.

243
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:34,233
-It'd be about 2 billion won.
-2 billion...

244
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:36,803
Two billion won?

245
00:15:37,497 --> 00:15:38,304
What?

246
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:41,780
For two billion dollars...

247
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:45,178
Is it enough to risk his life?

248
00:16:00,202 --> 00:16:01,217
It's been a while since I last saw you.

249
00:16:02,297 --> 00:16:03,612
I was waiting for you.

250
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,298
I heard you went to the Headquarters?

251
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,700
When are we getting the
blood test results?

252
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,370
We will get the results
by tomorrow afternoon.

253
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:13,189
They will send us a fax as
soon as they get the results.

254
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,050
It is sooner than I expected.

255
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:16,275
That's good to hear.

256
00:16:16,539 --> 00:16:17,443
Exactly.

257
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:22,750
Speaking of blood test results,

258
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,885
what is your blood type?

259
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:28,988
Your ideal type.

260
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:34,910
Try one more.

261
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:37,413
Beautiful doll?

262
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:40,910
One more.

263
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,418
A doll?

264
00:16:45,864 --> 00:16:46,906
I lose.

265
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:49,509
I lost.

266
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:51,210
I just gave it a shot.

267
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:53,713
You cheer me up when I'm down.

268
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:56,432
I didn't have to do it, but I did.

269
00:16:59,037 --> 00:17:00,720
Don't worry.

270
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,557
Win your battle, so that
I don't have to worry.

271
00:17:04,945 --> 00:17:06,859
I want to hold hands and hug you.

272
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:09,078
It's tough to hold back.

273
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:14,834
-Did you have to go there?
-That was a joke to put you at ease.

274
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:16,435
I'm sure it wasn't a joke.

275
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:19,338
I'm off to fight now.

276
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:24,210
So what's your blood type?

277
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,113
The type that would get me
locked up in your heart?

278
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:31,083
Go. Go as fast as you can. Run.

279
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:33,019
-I can say worse.
-Just go.

280
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,193
Go on inside.

281
00:17:43,284 --> 00:17:45,398
Her breathing and
temperature are normal.

282
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:50,570
You're cured now. We'll go
somewhere safe tomorrow.

283
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,673
There's a virus here.

284
00:17:56,606 --> 00:17:57,810
Not again.

285
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,513
This is Lieutenant Yoon. The
isolation ward lost power.

286
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:02,315
Is there a back-up generator?

287
00:18:02,854 --> 00:18:06,158
The problem's with the wires.
I'll be right there.

288
00:18:06,362 --> 00:18:07,853
The cafeteria's also...

289
00:18:09,907 --> 00:18:11,424
Mr Jin's ventilator.

290
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,893
-Pack up for me.
-Okay.

291
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,704
What's wrong with him?

292
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:39,552
-Pass me the sedative, please.
-Okay.

293
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:46,359
What's wrong?

294
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:50,563
-I'm coming in.
-Don't!

295
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,498
You'll become infected.

296
00:18:53,976 --> 00:18:56,085
We'll take care of things in here.

297
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,971
Do what you can to get the power back.

298
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:01,574
10 minutes. It'll take 10 minutes.

299
00:19:01,806 --> 00:19:02,910
Okay!

300
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,856
My goodness!

301
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:24,410
Get me a stethoscope.

302
00:19:28,272 --> 00:19:29,402
Are you okay?

303
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:35,408
His pulse is weak. Get a
portable breathing pump.

304
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:41,814
One, two, three.

305
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,382
-He bit you.
-One, two, three.

306
00:19:43,508 --> 00:19:44,917
Get that looked at.

307
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,925
-What happened? Are you okay?
-Don't talk to me. I'm out of breath.

308
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,694
One, two, three.

309
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:55,895
I'll do it.

310
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:58,097
How long has it been?

311
00:19:58,397 --> 00:19:59,598
Two minutes. He bit

312
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:01,300
Chihoon's arm.

313
00:20:01,392 --> 00:20:03,210
-Lee Chihoon.
-Later.

314
00:20:03,401 --> 00:20:07,707
One, two, three. One, two, three.

315
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:10,443
Two, three.

316
00:20:36,796 --> 00:20:41,207
You know wounds increase the risk
of getting infected, don't you?

317
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:43,242
Yes.

318
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:46,979
Do you also know that...

319
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:50,483
he could have died if
it weren't for you?

320
00:20:56,856 --> 00:20:58,657
You're a real doctor now.

321
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:01,694
I'll take some blood.

322
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:07,299
We're done cleaning up. We'll go now.

323
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:08,601
Thank you.

324
00:21:20,576 --> 00:21:21,714
Will he...

325
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,883
get infected?

326
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,418
Let's hope not.

327
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:29,588
He'll be isolated for now.

328
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:31,590
Dr. Chihoon.

329
00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:33,993
You were awesome earlier.

330
00:21:37,218 --> 00:21:39,031
You looked like a doctor just now.

331
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:41,934
Let's go.

332
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:58,384
Why are you crying?

333
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:00,119
Does it hurt?

334
00:22:01,743 --> 00:22:03,122
Do you have another wound?

335
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,110
No.

336
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:08,294
Because I'm fine.

337
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:14,249
I'm okay now.

338
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,980
Now I can call my family.

339
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:22,775
What do you mean?

340
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:25,077
What's wrong with you, Lee Chihoon?

341
00:22:30,078 --> 00:22:30,983
You're in isolation?

342
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:32,985
Why?

343
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:34,787
Are you...

344
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:36,889
...infected by the M3 virus?

345
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:40,426
I could be, but not yet.

346
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:44,530
I guess I was isolated
to become a real doctor.

347
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:49,068
That's what you say after calling
for the first time in a month?

348
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,770
Do you know how worried I was?

349
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:56,089
I thought I was going to be
divorced during my pregnancy.

350
00:22:56,179 --> 00:22:57,276
Hey.

351
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:00,179
That's not a bad idea.

352
00:23:00,684 --> 00:23:03,415
You could get a fortune in alimony.

353
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:05,117
What?

354
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,488
I love you, Jang Heeun.

355
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:13,008
I love you so much.

356
00:23:13,805 --> 00:23:15,594
It really is you.

357
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:19,665
You're back.

358
00:23:34,894 --> 00:23:36,782
They just left the city.

359
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:38,989
They'll reach the UN
camp in three hours.

360
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,220
Please look after them for
me, the kids too.

361
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:46,759
Doctor Kang.

362
00:23:48,004 --> 00:23:51,924
The blood test results just came
in by fax. Everyone's negative.

363
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,332
-Really?
-Yes.

364
00:23:55,134 --> 00:23:57,507
That's great news.
Does Captain Yoo know?

365
00:23:57,594 --> 00:24:02,207
He passed me that fax.
He went to release Sergeant Major Seo.

366
00:24:09,511 --> 00:24:14,420
She just fell asleep after bossing the
others around and eating some food.

367
00:24:14,518 --> 00:24:16,021
I thought so.

368
00:24:17,952 --> 00:24:19,258
In some rare cases,

369
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:23,450
an infected person could
show no symptoms.

370
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:25,864
She's a rare woman.

371
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,884
I hope that's the case.

372
00:24:32,665 --> 00:24:33,472
By the way,

373
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:35,474
have you heard?

374
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,876
About what?

375
00:24:38,077 --> 00:24:42,715
Thanks to my fast response,
there are no further cases in the city.

376
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:45,290
Once everyone is vaccinated,

377
00:24:45,371 --> 00:24:49,472
the threat level will be lowered,
from Warning to Caution.

378
00:24:49,555 --> 00:24:50,656
For that,

379
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:54,126
the UN wants to thank the
Mowuru Company Commander,

380
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:55,127
which is...

381
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:56,729
...none other than me.

382
00:24:57,596 --> 00:25:01,800
They don't really have to,
but they say they want to.

383
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:07,606
Did you hear me?

384
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:11,250
What did you say?

385
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:16,682
Thanks to my speedy response
to the situation...

386
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:20,352
Snoopy to Big Boss, there's
an incident in the cafeteria.

387
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:22,019
I repeat, an incident in the cafeteria.

388
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,923
We request your assistance.

389
00:26:22,066 --> 00:26:23,982
It's good to see familiar faces.

390
00:26:25,284 --> 00:26:26,685
A former comrade.

391
00:26:27,193 --> 00:26:28,787
My lifesaver.

392
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:33,475
And my little red rose.

393
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,078
How are you, Fatima?

394
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:40,766
Do you think he's here to get
tested for the M3 virus?

395
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:42,250
The virus?

396
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:44,837
Don't worry, Doctor.

397
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:46,880
We already tested negative.

398
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:49,575
The US Army came in advance to test me.

399
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:51,143
Apparently,

400
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:53,950
I can't be sick.

401
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:57,549
They love me more than when I
was a Delta Force Captain.

402
00:26:57,649 --> 00:27:00,552
Be quick, and watch your mouth.

403
00:27:00,853 --> 00:27:02,554
Don't ever say...

404
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:05,457
we are on the same side.

405
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,159
Okay.

406
00:27:07,936 --> 00:27:09,628
We can catch up next time.

407
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:12,731
I'm just here to see my Korean friend.

408
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:14,633
He was very ill.

409
00:27:15,348 --> 00:27:16,535
Mr Jin.

410
00:27:17,436 --> 00:27:18,770
Can I see him now?

411
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:24,143
Your friends aren't welcome here.

412
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:25,560
So...

413
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:28,213
get lost.

414
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,399
Well...

415
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:33,785
I can always catch up
with him next time.

416
00:27:34,186 --> 00:27:36,388
But just one question.

417
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,124
I heard my stuff is here.

418
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:43,028
It's very expensive,

419
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:46,064
sparkly,

420
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,066
and women...

421
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:49,865
...adore it.

422
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,410
Can I see that instead?

423
00:27:57,215 --> 00:27:59,317
This is not a lost and found.

424
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:01,813
I will give you 10 seconds...

425
00:28:03,409 --> 00:28:05,734
...to get out of my face.

426
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:09,221
Ten.

427
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:11,173
Nine.

428
00:28:12,654 --> 00:28:14,159
You should've opened him up.

429
00:28:35,032 --> 00:28:36,848
It's immune globulin.

430
00:28:37,008 --> 00:28:38,850
I couldn't visit my friend empty-handed.

431
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:42,120
This is for you, Doctor.

432
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:49,628
Please bring him back.

433
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,198
I have a lot to say to him.

434
00:28:58,259 --> 00:28:59,771
Looks like everyone's busy,

435
00:29:00,076 --> 00:29:02,874
so we shall go.

436
00:29:12,439 --> 00:29:16,622
-He knows what the US Army's up to.
-And he figured out our plan too.

437
00:29:18,327 --> 00:29:20,225
Strengthen the security
around the barracks.

438
00:29:32,222 --> 00:29:35,440
Is that guy the jerk who was
going to do something to her?

439
00:29:36,722 --> 00:29:38,619
Please look after Dr. Song for me.

440
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,812
I'll stay with her for a while.

441
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,532
The blood test results came back.

442
00:29:45,122 --> 00:29:46,318
What does...

443
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:48,303
...Dr. Song's result say?

444
00:29:59,483 --> 00:30:01,300
The results are back.

445
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,601
Really?

446
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,203
Then I'm free to go.

447
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:07,939
Let's go.

448
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,442
Not yet. I haven't
told you anything yet.

449
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:13,061
A fever, headache,
cough and chest pains.

450
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:15,955
My early symptoms were similar
to the M3 or Ebola virus,

451
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:19,451
but my skin's still flawless,
and you still look beautiful,

452
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:21,453
so my eyesight is fine.

453
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,557
My symptoms were from
another, more common virus.

454
00:30:25,724 --> 00:30:27,159
It's called a cold.

455
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,331
Yes, you fool.

456
00:30:32,763 --> 00:30:34,050
You had a cold.

457
00:30:34,247 --> 00:30:35,967
I was so worried.

458
00:31:13,059 --> 00:31:15,140
What are you doing? Let go of me.

459
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,765
You hugged me first.

460
00:31:16,837 --> 00:31:18,660
I'm regretting it now.

461
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:20,028
Let me go.

462
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:25,066
-Catch my cold, catch my cold.
-You're so childish.

463
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:32,224
Read this first.

464
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:33,513
While being quarantined,

465
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,310
I thought about this harder than anything
I'd ever thought about in my life.

466
00:31:37,047 --> 00:31:38,563
I think I have found the answer.

467
00:31:46,534 --> 00:31:48,039
What is it?

468
00:31:55,347 --> 00:31:56,780
Cefotaxime?

469
00:31:58,071 --> 00:31:59,358
A cure for Lyme disease.

470
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,453
Where's Doctor Kang?

471
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:08,743
According to reports written in...

472
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:12,045
...2007 and 2011 by Medipeace
doctors who were in western Africa,

473
00:32:12,126 --> 00:32:15,183
it worked on an average of
85 percent of the cases.

474
00:32:15,323 --> 00:32:18,637
54 out of 63 people and
73 out of 85 were cured.

475
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:21,139
How did you find this out?

476
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:24,070
Cefotaxime isn't usually used for this.

477
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:26,912
I analyzed the DNA of the
M3 virus, and looked up...

478
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,815
the molecular and chemical
formula of antibiotics.

479
00:32:29,915 --> 00:32:31,950
Then I did a comprehensive
search that led me to...

480
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:34,085
-Really?
-No.

481
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:36,855
I looked up all the
annual M3 virus reports.

482
00:32:36,946 --> 00:32:38,857
Slowly and meticulously.

483
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:41,560
I respect you.

484
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,361
Let's test it.

485
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:48,016
-But on our list of our supplies...
-It isn't there.

486
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,302
Then call Daniel and ask...

487
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:52,137
-I did.
-Already?

488
00:32:52,204 --> 00:32:55,357
It will arrive together with the vaccines.
Have a good day.

489
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,014
-Did you two fight?
-I'm playing hard to get.

490
00:33:03,133 --> 00:33:06,550
My goodness. Do you know how
worried she was about you?

491
00:33:27,513 --> 00:33:28,523
Salute.

492
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:32,811
Dad.

493
00:33:35,051 --> 00:33:36,450
I'm sick.

494
00:33:38,617 --> 00:33:40,619
Did you not receive any report yet?

495
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,221
I have.

496
00:33:45,924 --> 00:33:47,710
But you never called.

497
00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:51,663
You have a 50 percent
chance of surviving.

498
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:55,267
As a father,

499
00:33:56,106 --> 00:33:58,709
or as a commander officer,

500
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:03,810
there's nothing that I can do.

501
00:34:06,754 --> 00:34:08,980
So I waited for you to call.

502
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:12,751
I'm that powerless.

503
00:34:14,653 --> 00:34:16,087
I won't lose.

504
00:34:16,755 --> 00:34:18,350
I will fight and live.

505
00:34:18,757 --> 00:34:20,292
Don't worry, Dad.

506
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:21,860
I won't worry.

507
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:23,324
You will fight.

508
00:34:24,855 --> 00:34:27,032
I hope you will.

509
00:34:28,913 --> 00:34:31,303
Instead, just do two things for me.

510
00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:37,208
Do you have that many favors to ask?

511
00:34:39,561 --> 00:34:40,779
First,

512
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,551
forgive me, Dad.

513
00:34:49,968 --> 00:34:51,573
Before coming here,

514
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:55,243
I threatened you that,

515
00:34:56,061 --> 00:34:57,495
you'd lose both...

516
00:34:58,052 --> 00:35:00,665
...a daughter and a lieutenant.

517
00:35:06,362 --> 00:35:08,250
I apologise for saying that.

518
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:13,878
It's okay.

519
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,881
Just get better.

520
00:35:19,651 --> 00:35:21,853
What's the second?

521
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,992
When I get better...

522
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:30,061
If I really don't die,

523
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:35,967
let Sergeant Major Seo stay in the army.

524
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:40,639
Don't make him leave, Dad.

525
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,590
Please?

526
00:35:47,112 --> 00:35:48,747
I overheard everything.

527
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:53,018
Yoon Myeongju, go outside.

528
00:36:00,529 --> 00:36:03,194
However, I won't have a
sergeant major as a son-in-law.

529
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:04,929
You have to quit being a soldier.

530
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:07,530
I, Sergeant Major Seo,

531
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:10,301
was granted permission
to date Lieutenant Yoon.

532
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:11,302
Salute.

533
00:36:11,493 --> 00:36:13,795
Did he really give permission?

534
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:14,980
Yes, Ma'am.

535
00:36:17,727 --> 00:36:20,111
I loved being with him so much,

536
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:22,814
so I pretended not to know.

537
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:27,752
I'm sorry, Dad.

538
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,158
You're always worried about me.

539
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,562
But I'm always worried about him.

540
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:43,168
That sounds more like my daughter.

541
00:36:44,436 --> 00:36:47,172
You're back to your usual self,
who always makes me worry.

542
00:36:56,538 --> 00:36:58,349
I'll call you again later, Dad.

543
00:36:59,117 --> 00:37:00,952
I think it's time to get an injection.

544
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,238
I have to hang up now.

545
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:12,897
Lieutenant Yoon.

546
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:15,600
Yoon Myeongju!

547
00:37:28,051 --> 00:37:29,280
Come on.

548
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,559
She has a fever of 41°C.

549
00:37:35,662 --> 00:37:37,538
The fever reducer won't work.

550
00:37:37,637 --> 00:37:39,524
This is what we were worried about.

551
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:42,110
-Overreaction of the immune system?
-Yes, the cytokine storm.

552
00:37:42,227 --> 00:37:43,228
Steroid, please.

553
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:45,230
Fill the tub with ice.

554
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:54,439
We need to bring her fever
down for her to be alive.

555
00:37:56,808 --> 00:38:01,014
Responding to symptoms that pop up
is the only thing we can only do.

556
00:38:01,095 --> 00:38:04,816
Essentially, we have to hope
that Sang Hyun's cure works.

557
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:06,417
Has the cure not arrived yet?

558
00:38:06,498 --> 00:38:09,187
It will arrive with the preventive
vaccines, so it should soon...

559
00:38:09,988 --> 00:38:11,189
It's Daniel.

560
00:38:11,682 --> 00:38:13,391
Hello? Have you arrived?

561
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:14,809
Pardon?

562
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,377
What?

563
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:24,602
The vehicle carrying the
preventive vaccines was stolen.

564
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:26,688
The vehicle...

565
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,773
...also carries Lieutenant Yoon's cure.

566
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,108
Who on earth stole it?

567
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:33,278
If we don't get it back in an
hour, it will be too late.

568
00:38:33,409 --> 00:38:36,314
It'll take at least four hours
if the hospital sends it again.

569
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:37,916
Could there be another way?

570
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:39,634
We need to find the thief.

571
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:41,234
Communications security,
I'll call back...

572
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,499
Captain Big Boss, come in.

573
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:45,790
This is Argus, over.

574
00:38:46,404 --> 00:38:48,092
What the hell are you doing?

575
00:38:50,409 --> 00:38:52,297
Bring back the medicine. Now.

576
00:38:52,397 --> 00:38:55,099
I'm a business man, not a soldier.

577
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:57,001
Instead of making orders,

578
00:38:57,602 --> 00:38:58,937
let's make a deal.

579
00:38:59,282 --> 00:39:02,480
Bring me the diamonds, if you
want to get your medicines back.

580
00:39:05,055 --> 00:39:06,259
I think I know...

581
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:08,150
...where Myeongju's medicine is.

582
00:39:20,815 --> 00:39:22,020
This is Snoopy.

583
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:23,828
We have located everyone.

584
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:35,580
-Where's Argus?
-He's busy.

585
00:39:36,441 --> 00:39:37,342
Where is it?

586
00:40:01,072 --> 00:40:01,949
Okay?

587
00:40:06,107 --> 00:40:07,021
Move.

588
00:40:14,377 --> 00:40:15,213
Yes.

589
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:18,816
Thank you for the diamonds.

590
00:40:22,604 --> 00:40:25,023
Stop right there!

591
00:40:36,999 --> 00:40:39,304
Scream if it hurts. It's all right.

592
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:41,556
I'm fine.

593
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,241
I can hold it.

594
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,842
Hold on a little longer.

595
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:46,344
The cure will be here soon.

596
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:50,718
-Doctor Kang.
-The medicine must be here. Stay with her.

597
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:59,410
What are you guys doing?

598
00:41:03,984 --> 00:41:05,296
Official duty.

599
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:09,367
This girl that you are taking
care of is under arrest...

600
00:41:09,454 --> 00:41:12,570
...for dealing stolen
medicine in the black market.

601
00:41:13,171 --> 00:41:15,780
The accomplice has already confessed.

602
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:29,787
There must be a misunderstanding.

603
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:31,289
She didn't steal it.

604
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:35,393
We gave those medicines to Fatima.
I gave them to her. So,

605
00:41:35,651 --> 00:41:37,562
you have no reason to arrest her now.

606
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:40,031
Even if you had given it to her,

607
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:44,035
she's still under arrest for
dealing in the black market.

608
00:41:44,135 --> 00:41:47,455
Are you that foreign doctor
who was at the scene?

609
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:53,845
-I don't understand why there's no
cure even with advances in medicine.

610
00:41:53,945 --> 00:41:55,630
It's because it's a
medicine that doesn't sell.

611
00:41:55,749 --> 00:41:57,257
If it doesn't sell, it doesn't make money.

612
00:41:57,344 --> 00:41:58,750
If it doesn't make money,
they don't make it.

613
00:41:58,868 --> 00:42:02,553
People are dying. How can they not
make it because it isn't profitable?

614
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,355
That's why people like us...

615
00:42:04,477 --> 00:42:06,657
do things that we're told not to do.

616
00:42:06,771 --> 00:42:08,893
And we go to places where
we're told not to go.

617
00:42:09,605 --> 00:42:11,229
We're hoping for the world to change.

618
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:12,810
After taking this medicine,

619
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:16,067
I hope Doctor Yoon gets cured like magic.

620
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,869
This is a herb that brings down fever.

621
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:19,670
Let's decoct it well.

622
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:21,572
Let's make magic happen.

623
00:42:27,577 --> 00:42:28,780
Will that...

624
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:30,464
be helpful?

625
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:32,750
We need to do everything we can.

626
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:35,653
Whether it's Western medicine,
Oriental medicine...

627
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:37,188
or a prayer.

628
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:42,260
To medical team. Medical team,
please gather in front of Medicube.

629
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,961
The cure has arrived. Over.

630
00:42:44,162 --> 00:42:45,463
All right. Over.

631
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:46,464
Let's go.

632
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:51,085
-Nurse Ha.
-Thank you for your work.

633
00:42:51,169 --> 00:42:53,671
-Here you go.
-Thank you for your work.

634
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:55,233
Her fever is 37.5°C.

635
00:44:16,521 --> 00:44:18,122
Where is Doctor Kang?

636
00:44:18,477 --> 00:44:19,891
I can't find her.

637
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:21,993
You're right.

638
00:44:22,293 --> 00:44:25,196
Yesterday, when the police
came to arrest Fatima,

639
00:44:25,279 --> 00:44:27,465
so she went to the
police station with them.

640
00:44:28,466 --> 00:44:29,767
What did you say?

641
00:44:30,368 --> 00:44:32,480
Are you sure they were the Urk police?

642
00:45:58,554 --> 00:46:00,858
It's just too bad that you got hurt.

643
00:46:01,753 --> 00:46:03,060
What should we do?

644
00:46:10,034 --> 00:46:13,037
I mean, the doctor can't treat you now.

645
00:46:15,277 --> 00:46:16,974
Get your hands off her.

646
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:19,176
Can't you see what's going on here?

647
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:20,978
Do you want to die?

648
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,682
Or do you want to get
your girlfriend killed?

649
00:46:26,651 --> 00:46:29,086
It's my turn to give the
orders now, Captain.

650
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:31,856
The only person these guys won't kill...

651
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:34,392
...is me.

652
00:46:37,061 --> 00:46:38,162
What do you want?

653
00:46:41,232 --> 00:46:43,434
Finally, you understand.

654
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:45,836
All right, let's talk.

655
00:47:07,631 --> 00:47:11,362
The weapons will be delivered
to North Urk at midnight.

656
00:47:11,629 --> 00:47:14,565
My own country will try to kill
me once the delivery is made.

657
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:18,202
But I want to live,
and I want the money.

658
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:22,106
So get me away out of this country...

659
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,208
after the delivery is made tonight.

660
00:47:24,414 --> 00:47:26,744
That's all I want. It's my escape route.

661
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:30,531
Come on.

662
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:33,334
Save me like you did the
last time, Captain.

663
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:37,021
Tonight at 2AM.

664
00:47:38,217 --> 00:47:39,824
You can't be too early,

665
00:47:40,698 --> 00:47:42,193
and you can't be too late.

666
00:47:42,393 --> 00:47:43,594
I wouldn't want to...

667
00:47:44,579 --> 00:47:46,597
...sell her on a personal grudge.

668
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:51,235
I will kill you with my own hands.

669
00:47:51,736 --> 00:47:53,571
I will make sure...

670
00:47:56,216 --> 00:47:58,309
...to kill you with my own hands.

671
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:03,714
I'm going to learn Korean just for you.

672
00:48:04,949 --> 00:48:06,083
Let's go.

673
00:48:36,714 --> 00:48:38,716
I have such good memories of Urk.

674
00:48:40,302 --> 00:48:41,619
And you...

675
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:46,357
...are the perfect person to
spend my last night with.

676
00:48:57,013 --> 00:48:58,636
This is Big Boss, do you copy?

677
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:05,276
Dr. Kang, listen carefully to what I say.

678
00:49:06,877 --> 00:49:09,897
I will make sure I
find you and save you.

679
00:49:15,008 --> 00:49:16,921
You do know that I'm a
great worker, right?

680
00:49:17,588 --> 00:49:19,210
I'll be there soon. So...

681
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:22,426
Don't be afraid, and don't cry.

682
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:26,630
Just wait for me.

683
00:49:28,471 --> 00:49:29,589
I'll be there soon.

684
00:49:41,537 --> 00:49:45,349
And I also look forward
to seeing you, Big Boss.

685
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:27,625
Are you insane?

686
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:30,811
Get a grip, will you?

687
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:32,713
A hostage rescue?

688
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,532
Do you think you're
Team Alpha right now?

689
00:50:34,999 --> 00:50:37,234
You're just a dispatched soldier.

690
00:50:37,334 --> 00:50:40,237
You're here publicly
on a peaceful mission.

691
00:50:40,614 --> 00:50:41,839
I need to go, Sir.

692
00:50:43,304 --> 00:50:45,609
-And I will go.
-You aren't going anywhere!

693
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,110
I must go, Sir.

694
00:50:48,193 --> 00:50:49,910
-I'll be back, Sir.
-Hey.

695
00:50:51,459 --> 00:50:52,850
Do you see this?

696
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:55,786
Do you see this blinking light?

697
00:50:55,853 --> 00:50:58,078
Line two is Commander Yoon, and
line three is the Blue House.

698
00:50:58,165 --> 00:50:59,373
What will you do with this?

699
00:51:09,014 --> 00:51:11,259
Salute. This is Lieutenant Colonel Park...

700
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:13,245
I'm the Chief of Foreign
Affairs and National Security.

701
00:51:13,411 --> 00:51:14,605
Let me be straight with you.

702
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:16,924
Is it an abduction?

703
00:51:20,586 --> 00:51:22,889
It's not exactly an abduction,
but it's something similar...

704
00:51:22,970 --> 00:51:24,081
It is an abduction, Sir.

705
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:25,916
Are you sure?

706
00:51:26,098 --> 00:51:28,886
That's not what we heard from the CIA.

707
00:51:28,986 --> 00:51:30,480
It is an abduction, Sir.

708
00:51:31,188 --> 00:51:32,289
The abductors are...

709
00:51:33,891 --> 00:51:35,693
...a total of 14 people, all armed.

710
00:51:35,793 --> 00:51:38,696
Skip that. I'll hear about the
situation from the US Army.

711
00:51:38,896 --> 00:51:41,332
I called to tell you this.

712
00:51:42,132 --> 00:51:45,269
Keep this confidential until
everything becomes perfectly clear,

713
00:51:45,381 --> 00:51:47,037
...and be on standby.

714
00:51:47,171 --> 00:51:47,649
Yes, Sir.

715
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:50,140
We have no time to standby.
We have no time to waste!

716
00:51:52,577 --> 00:51:54,178
I will begin the rescue mission...

717
00:51:55,412 --> 00:51:57,381
...according to the emergency
operation guidelines.

718
00:51:57,581 --> 00:51:58,882
What did you say?

719
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:02,553
Don't you understand that you must keep
it confidential and be on standby?

720
00:52:02,675 --> 00:52:04,355
Look here, Captain Yoo.

721
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:09,442
Just because I let things pass
with the VIP case before,

722
00:52:09,537 --> 00:52:11,929
do you think you can
just ignore my words?

723
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:15,410
This nation did not put a
gun in your hands for this.

724
00:52:16,367 --> 00:52:19,003
This isn't a matter of whether
one person dies or not.

725
00:52:19,222 --> 00:52:21,538
This problem is at a national level.

726
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:29,947
If the nation is indifferent
to a single person's death,

727
00:52:30,014 --> 00:52:31,849
that seems more problematic.

728
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:34,418
I'm not sure which nation you serve,

729
00:52:34,918 --> 00:52:36,954
but I will serve my nation.

730
00:52:40,624 --> 00:52:42,159
Are you crazy?

731
00:52:44,175 --> 00:52:47,580
Stop right there. If anyone
is there, stop Shijin!

732
00:52:48,766 --> 00:52:49,967
Stop.

733
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,302
You need to standby, Sir.

734
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,507
Are those gates strong?

735
00:52:57,107 --> 00:52:59,209
I've crashed a few cars before,

736
00:52:59,476 --> 00:53:00,911
and those gates will break.

737
00:53:05,173 --> 00:53:07,980
-You mustn't do this, Sir.
-Move, if you don't want to get hurt.

738
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:10,888
I'm only going to push forward.

739
00:53:11,293 --> 00:53:12,289
Captain Yoo!

740
00:53:16,593 --> 00:53:19,396
He wants to talk to you. It's the
commander of Special Forces.

741
00:53:24,908 --> 00:53:28,072
-Salute, this is Captain Yoo Shijin.
-I'll give you exactly three hours.

742
00:53:29,073 --> 00:53:31,875
I won't know where you are
for the next three hours.

743
00:53:32,376 --> 00:53:35,546
For those three hours, you aren't
the captain of Team Alpha,

744
00:53:35,646 --> 00:53:37,844
nor are you the company
commander of Mowuru Company.

745
00:53:37,947 --> 00:53:40,050
You are also not a
captain of the ROK Army.

746
00:53:40,317 --> 00:53:41,351
Do you object?

747
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:43,353
I do not, Sir.

748
00:53:43,454 --> 00:53:44,371
That's all.

749
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:46,056
Salute.

750
00:53:59,915 --> 00:54:01,538
How's Myeongju?

751
00:54:01,645 --> 00:54:04,041
She's not conscious yet, but
her temperature is dropping.

752
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:05,642
I think the medicine worked.

753
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:07,344
That's a relief.

754
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:10,880
I will be going out for a bit.

755
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:14,184
I am sorry...

756
00:54:16,153 --> 00:54:17,337
...for not seeing you before I leave.

757
00:54:18,956 --> 00:54:20,858
Why are you going out?

758
00:54:23,327 --> 00:54:25,662
Myeongju is awake.
I'll contact you again.

759
00:54:26,251 --> 00:54:27,281
Myeongju.

760
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:28,632
Excuse me.

761
00:54:53,657 --> 00:54:55,159
Good luck, Captain.

762
00:55:08,184 --> 00:55:09,589
Well done, Doctor.

763
00:55:11,909 --> 00:55:14,780
If you need anything,
you just let me know.

764
00:55:15,113 --> 00:55:17,247
I'm not sure why you brought me here.

765
00:55:17,748 --> 00:55:20,150
But if you were going to ask
for money, forget about it.

766
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:23,050
I have more debt than assets.

767
00:55:35,912 --> 00:55:37,201
In English.

768
00:55:39,403 --> 00:55:41,705
I can't have you think
that I'm a nice guy.

769
00:55:42,206 --> 00:55:44,208
Especially if I'm holding a gun.

770
00:55:44,908 --> 00:55:46,910
Now, how many times have I told you?

771
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:48,812
You're more likely to get shot...

772
00:55:49,621 --> 00:55:51,648
...being around a guy with a gun.

773
00:56:00,408 --> 00:56:01,291
No.

774
00:56:05,596 --> 00:56:10,767
Big Boss. He's smart, funny...

775
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:15,072
...and mysterious.

776
00:56:16,974 --> 00:56:17,774
But...

777
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:20,878
He has a lot of secrets.

778
00:56:21,979 --> 00:56:24,280
He'll disappear from time to time.

779
00:56:24,883 --> 00:56:26,383
He'll be hard to contact.

780
00:56:27,784 --> 00:56:29,186
And then, one day...

781
00:56:34,258 --> 00:56:36,360
He'll never come back.

782
00:56:43,851 --> 00:56:45,502
You should break up with him now.

783
00:56:50,483 --> 00:56:52,075
This is an advice,

784
00:56:53,377 --> 00:56:54,678
not a warning.

785
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:05,789
That kind of thing should be
said with a roll of cash...

786
00:57:05,889 --> 00:57:07,491
and a cup of water on the side.

787
00:57:08,449 --> 00:57:10,527
You can't make me break up
without giving me anything.

788
00:57:12,329 --> 00:57:14,731
You must be dying to
know what I'm saying.

789
00:57:15,732 --> 00:57:17,350
You don't deserve to know.

790
00:57:18,035 --> 00:57:19,453
You trash.

791
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:23,941
You are not easy.

792
00:57:25,532 --> 00:57:29,746
Big Boss, answer me.

793
00:57:37,853 --> 00:57:39,756
-Salute.
-When did Captain Yoo leave?

794
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:42,242
He exited through the
main gate at 17:30, Sir.

795
00:57:42,345 --> 00:57:43,560
What about Ms Kang?

796
00:57:43,742 --> 00:57:44,578
Well,

797
00:57:45,062 --> 00:57:47,197
she supposedly went to the local
police station yesterday.

798
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:48,799
But her return was not yet reported.

799
00:57:51,714 --> 00:57:52,636
Is something...

800
00:57:53,036 --> 00:57:54,037
...wrong, Sir?

801
00:57:57,450 --> 00:57:58,742
It's something bad.

802
00:58:12,723 --> 00:58:14,024
It's been a while.

803
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:17,828
Long time no talk.

804
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,010
Is everything okay?

805
00:58:20,397 --> 00:58:22,699
Let me use your last card.

806
00:58:25,302 --> 00:58:27,104
I need a chopper.

807
00:58:29,373 --> 00:58:31,110
I have a date again.

808
00:59:09,413 --> 00:59:12,616
"Descendants of The Sun"

809
00:59:19,322 --> 00:59:20,407
Drop your gun!

810
00:59:27,424 --> 00:59:28,519
Let's go.
