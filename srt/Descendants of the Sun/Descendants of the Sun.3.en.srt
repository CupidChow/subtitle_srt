1
00:01:12,188 --> 00:01:15,177
Isn't that soldier we saw last time?

2
00:01:15,276 --> 00:01:16,662
I think so, too.

3
00:01:20,952 --> 00:01:24,260
I'm in charge of your safety
during your stay in Urk.

4
00:01:24,702 --> 00:01:27,585
I'm the commanding officer,
Captain Yoo Shijin.

5
00:01:27,835 --> 00:01:28,811
Nice to meet you.

6
00:01:29,335 --> 00:01:30,652
-Hello.
-Hello.

7
00:01:30,847 --> 00:01:33,564
From here, we will be traveling
to Mowuru Airport,

8
00:01:33,774 --> 00:01:37,111
by CH-47,
the helicopter you see behind us.

9
00:01:42,258 --> 00:01:44,115
During transport, you're only allowed
to carry your personal items,

10
00:01:44,242 --> 00:01:47,004
in the duffel bag provided,
limited to one bag per person.

11
00:01:47,186 --> 00:01:51,931
-What in the world?
-How could this be?

12
00:01:53,626 --> 00:01:55,513
Your remaining luggage
will be transported through land route,

13
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:57,543
and you'll get them by tomorrow evening.

14
00:01:57,648 --> 00:01:58,481
Well then.

15
00:01:58,989 --> 00:02:02,331
We will leave in 10 minutes, at 1:25 PM.

16
00:02:43,456 --> 00:02:45,084
One, two, three!

17
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:48,607
"Episode 3"

18
00:03:06,412 --> 00:03:07,513
Welcome.

19
00:03:09,766 --> 00:03:10,743
Welcome.

20
00:03:15,661 --> 00:03:16,756
Welcome.

21
00:03:19,093 --> 00:03:20,466
That was natural, right?

22
00:03:20,906 --> 00:03:22,522
It sure was.

23
00:03:23,841 --> 00:03:25,466
That's the Medicube.

24
00:03:26,015 --> 00:03:27,647
And this looks like the place
where we'll be staying at.

25
00:03:28,824 --> 00:03:31,909
I'm almost 40 and it sucks
to stay at a military lodging.

26
00:03:32,027 --> 00:03:33,764
I like it because it feels like
we're on a field trip.

27
00:03:47,011 --> 00:03:49,701
Our carriers are not here yet,
so there's not much to organize.

28
00:03:49,793 --> 00:03:51,609
That's a good thing since we're all tired.

29
00:03:53,806 --> 00:03:54,687
Knock-knock.

30
00:03:57,042 --> 00:03:58,642
Have you been well?

31
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,355
You don't remember me?

32
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:08,007
The runaway from the hospital?

33
00:04:08,116 --> 00:04:09,528
Right, that thief?

34
00:04:09,647 --> 00:04:10,835
-My goodness!
-My gosh!

35
00:04:13,376 --> 00:04:15,813
I'm Private Kim Gibeom.

36
00:04:15,978 --> 00:04:19,669
What are you doing here?
This is so amazing.

37
00:04:19,786 --> 00:04:20,810
I know, right?

38
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,309
Try to run in place.

39
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,031
You want me to run in place?

40
00:04:24,176 --> 00:04:26,619
The ankle you sprained
was the right one, right?

41
00:04:26,762 --> 00:04:29,019
-I want to see if you are all better now.
-Okay.

42
00:04:30,806 --> 00:04:32,284
I'm all better thanks to you.

43
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:34,477
I got first class active duty
for my physical examination

44
00:04:34,976 --> 00:04:36,657
So, you no longer pickpocket?

45
00:04:36,786 --> 00:04:38,531
Private Kim Gibeom.

46
00:04:38,667 --> 00:04:39,524
As a Republic of Korea's soldier,

47
00:04:39,635 --> 00:04:40,691
I keep my honor and loyalty,

48
00:04:40,809 --> 00:04:42,539
and closely unite with my team
through comradeship.

49
00:04:46,772 --> 00:04:48,835
Quit doing that
or the springs will pop open.

50
00:04:48,964 --> 00:04:51,256
-You stop it.
-Stop what?

51
00:04:51,406 --> 00:04:52,581
Stop unpacking!

52
00:04:52,677 --> 00:04:54,355
If we are going to take off,
now would be the time.

53
00:04:54,486 --> 00:04:57,728
Do you know how many endemics
we could get in a remote place like this?

54
00:04:57,836 --> 00:04:58,613
How many?

55
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:00,525
I asked you because I don't know either.

56
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,437
Therefore, let's run before we get sick.

57
00:05:04,616 --> 00:05:05,603
Get out of here.

58
00:05:05,745 --> 00:05:07,532
Go back to your tent. Why are you here?

59
00:05:07,636 --> 00:05:10,644
Didn't you hear Moyeon and Chairman Lee's
conversation earlier?

60
00:05:10,763 --> 00:05:11,897
They said it's volunteering,

61
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:13,223
but this is actually a punishment.

62
00:05:13,356 --> 00:05:15,492
Why should we go through
other's punishment?

63
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:18,709
Having known you for almost 30 years
is my punishment.

64
00:05:18,814 --> 00:05:20,900
Is that how you really feel?
That knowing me is a punishment?

65
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,344
You thought it was a blessing, then?

66
00:05:24,577 --> 00:05:26,450
♪Springs, please pop out

67
00:05:26,538 --> 00:05:28,244
♪Prick on Ha Jaae's waist

68
00:05:28,365 --> 00:05:29,730
What a child!

69
00:05:37,031 --> 00:05:38,453
How are we supposed to do this?

70
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,372
Sir, I need to inspect your camera.

71
00:05:51,566 --> 00:05:53,020
Please erase the photos
you just took at once.

72
00:05:54,186 --> 00:05:55,886
It didn't come out well, right?

73
00:05:56,005 --> 00:05:56,893
Should I take another one?

74
00:05:56,994 --> 00:05:57,909
Never mind.

75
00:05:58,069 --> 00:05:59,873
We are not allowed
to have our pictures taken.

76
00:06:00,006 --> 00:06:01,354
Why is that, sir?

77
00:06:01,472 --> 00:06:04,052
Due to military regulations,
I can't tell you that.

78
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:05,685
That's the way they are.

79
00:06:05,885 --> 00:06:07,854
They have so many secrets they can't tell,

80
00:06:08,148 --> 00:06:10,576
due to rules and regulations.

81
00:06:14,368 --> 00:06:15,902
But how do you know that?

82
00:06:46,346 --> 00:06:48,828
Did he really not see me,
or is he just pretending?

83
00:07:24,784 --> 00:07:25,893
Aren't you going to open it?

84
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:27,375
I can open it later.

85
00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:29,184
I can't wait.

86
00:07:29,661 --> 00:07:30,978
What if there's Choco Pie in there?

87
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:33,289
It's more likely a terrorist bomb.

88
00:07:33,356 --> 00:07:35,241
Why do you have to be like that?

89
00:07:36,115 --> 00:07:38,830
A man only dies once not twice.

90
00:07:41,956 --> 00:07:43,032
You should open it up,

91
00:07:44,275 --> 00:07:45,209
like a real man should.

92
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:56,686
The red ginseng
is probably for Sergeant Im.

93
00:07:57,071 --> 00:07:58,894
The guitar strings are for Sergeant Choi.

94
00:07:59,306 --> 00:08:01,233
Drama DVDs for Staff Sergeant Gong.

95
00:08:05,216 --> 00:08:07,840
What's so good about her ex-boyfriend
who wears his boots wrongly,

96
00:08:08,128 --> 00:08:09,636
that she even sent gifts for his comrades?

97
00:08:10,436 --> 00:08:12,739
She's really hopeless.

98
00:08:12,851 --> 00:08:14,424
That is why I'm upset.

99
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,830
But, where is mine?

100
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:27,090
I can't believe this.

101
00:08:30,174 --> 00:08:33,674
It seems like
you didn't get anything either.

102
00:08:34,862 --> 00:08:38,322
My gift is on its way right now.

103
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:39,783
"Sergeant Major Seo, your gift
is on its way. I miss you everyday"

104
00:08:41,026 --> 00:08:42,528
I think she's getting deployed.

105
00:08:43,117 --> 00:08:44,439
You mean here?

106
00:08:46,216 --> 00:08:47,649
Salute.

107
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:49,506
I'm reporting to you, sir.

108
00:08:49,609 --> 00:08:51,100
Starting from 2015, May 21st,

109
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,182
I, Lieutenant Yoon Myeongju,

110
00:08:52,316 --> 00:08:54,188
has been ordered to be dispatched
to the medical corps,

111
00:08:54,292 --> 00:08:55,482
of Taebaek unit in Urk.

112
00:08:55,598 --> 00:08:56,776
This is my report to you, sir.

113
00:08:56,902 --> 00:08:58,267
Salute.

114
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:06,236
I will return back safely.

115
00:09:06,721 --> 00:09:08,421
So you are going go there after all?

116
00:09:08,556 --> 00:09:09,318
Yes.

117
00:09:09,811 --> 00:09:11,437
And I'm very happy that I might die.

118
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,536
I have always told you this,

119
00:09:12,644 --> 00:09:14,627
I prefer Yoo Shijin.

120
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:15,826
He is good enough to be a general.

121
00:09:15,945 --> 00:09:17,380
That's why he is also good enough
to be my son-in-law.

122
00:09:18,576 --> 00:09:20,607
You should know that it will only get
more difficult for Seo Daeyoung,

123
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:21,684
if you keep acting like this.

124
00:09:21,806 --> 00:09:23,067
A personal greed of the superior,

125
00:09:23,178 --> 00:09:24,885
is considered as army irregularities.

126
00:09:25,636 --> 00:09:27,667
Do you want to lose
another great subordinate?

127
00:09:27,816 --> 00:09:31,172
Seo Daeyoung remained as a soldier
because he understood my sentiment.

128
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,236
I never lost my subordinates.

129
00:09:33,356 --> 00:09:35,522
That's not because
you are great by all means father,

130
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:38,522
but that's because Sergeant Major Seo
is a real soldier.

131
00:09:39,489 --> 00:09:42,996
That is the reason why I love him.

132
00:09:43,176 --> 00:09:44,570
And the reason why I can't lose him.

133
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,590
If you try to stop my dispatchment again,

134
00:09:49,869 --> 00:09:51,972
you will lose me as your subordinate,

135
00:09:52,577 --> 00:09:54,439
and as your daughter.

136
00:09:55,057 --> 00:09:56,112
That's all for me to report.

137
00:09:56,676 --> 00:09:57,820
Seriously?

138
00:09:58,073 --> 00:10:00,524
Myeongju's boyfriend and that guy
are really there?

139
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:02,540
Yes, they were dispatched here.

140
00:10:03,699 --> 00:10:05,758
I was so nervous at the airport.

141
00:10:06,646 --> 00:10:07,802
It must've been obvious, right?

142
00:10:07,948 --> 00:10:09,500
I'm sure it was obvious.

143
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:11,104
You guys must be fated for each other.

144
00:10:11,255 --> 00:10:13,884
How can you meet each other again
halfway across the world?

145
00:10:14,095 --> 00:10:15,143
Are you happy to see him again?

146
00:10:15,256 --> 00:10:18,355
What do you mean happy?
It's really uncomfortable.

147
00:10:18,466 --> 00:10:20,478
Hello? Hello?

148
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:22,000
Can you not hear me?

149
00:10:22,268 --> 00:10:23,792
-Hello?
-Moyeon.

150
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:24,950
Hello?

151
00:10:25,716 --> 00:10:26,828
Kang Moyeon.

152
00:10:26,935 --> 00:10:29,301
But I can hear you. Hello?

153
00:10:34,132 --> 00:10:36,661
Gosh, I guess this really
is the middle of nowhere.

154
00:11:05,148 --> 00:11:05,848
Hey.

155
00:11:06,354 --> 00:11:08,577
That's dirty.

156
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,820
Wait.

157
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:20,293
Eat this.

158
00:11:34,706 --> 00:11:37,545
You shouldn't give it out
if you can't give it to everyone.

159
00:11:45,886 --> 00:11:48,253
You recklessly crossed
the safety zone fence.

160
00:11:48,426 --> 00:11:49,886
You crossed it, too.

161
00:11:50,006 --> 00:11:52,116
And you don't have any
thought of reflecting.

162
00:11:58,362 --> 00:11:59,699
Go to the training compound.

163
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:01,383
There's a party over there.

164
00:12:01,678 --> 00:12:03,717
You know Sergeant Choi, right?

165
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:05,881
-Yes!
-Yes!

166
00:12:09,739 --> 00:12:10,757
What did you say to them?

167
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:12,479
I said, I'll shoot them
if they don't leave.

168
00:12:13,243 --> 00:12:14,722
Don't lie.

169
00:12:15,748 --> 00:12:17,617
I call this a joke.

170
00:12:20,025 --> 00:12:21,252
I'm leaving first.

171
00:12:29,169 --> 00:12:30,196
Don't move.

172
00:12:38,277 --> 00:12:41,394
You just stepped on a mine.

173
00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:43,900
What did I step on? A mine?

174
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,118
Yes, on the right. I said don't move!

175
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:49,583
Really? Did I really step on a mine?

176
00:12:49,719 --> 00:12:53,382
What do I do? Will I die?

177
00:12:57,623 --> 00:12:59,765
Including the time in Military Academy,
I've been in the army for 15 years,

178
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,837
I've never seen a person live
after stepping on a mine.

179
00:13:01,946 --> 00:13:04,535
How can you say that?
A soldier shouldn't say that!

180
00:13:04,652 --> 00:13:06,334
Do something!

181
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,391
You said you were in the special force!

182
00:13:08,526 --> 00:13:10,136
In the movies,

183
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,598
they use a Macgyver knife
to disassemble the explosive.

184
00:13:12,694 --> 00:13:13,894
I saw something like that.

185
00:13:16,731 --> 00:13:19,059
Including years as a boy scout,
I've been on the field for 25 years,

186
00:13:20,306 --> 00:13:22,354
but a person who uses a Mcgyver knife
to disassemble an explosive?

187
00:13:23,308 --> 00:13:24,750
I've only seen one person.

188
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:28,388
See. There is such people. Who is it?

189
00:13:31,012 --> 00:13:33,149
The main character of the movie you saw.

190
00:13:35,322 --> 00:13:36,832
Hey, you jerk!

191
00:13:40,972 --> 00:13:45,374
Did you just curse at the only soldier
who can help you?

192
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:48,341
You said that you can't help me.
What should I do now?

193
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:49,620
Am I going to die?

194
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,885
You won't die.

195
00:13:51,826 --> 00:13:52,994
Is there a solution?

196
00:13:54,153 --> 00:13:55,060
Lift your legs.

197
00:13:57,956 --> 00:13:59,481
I'll step on it for you.

198
00:14:01,994 --> 00:14:03,809
What do you mean
by stepping on it for me?

199
00:14:03,928 --> 00:14:04,842
Then, will it not explode?

200
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:05,834
It will explode.

201
00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:08,517
I'll step on it and die for you.

202
00:14:08,643 --> 00:14:11,176
Does that make any sense?
What are you saying?

203
00:14:11,316 --> 00:14:13,038
Why would you die instead of me?

204
00:14:13,176 --> 00:14:17,048
Hurry up and bring someone who can help.
There must be a solution.

205
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,318
Stop giving up because you can't do it.

206
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,516
Hurry!

207
00:14:20,632 --> 00:14:21,573
Hurry...

208
00:14:36,952 --> 00:14:37,928
What is this?

209
00:14:39,182 --> 00:14:40,389
Why didn't it explode?

210
00:14:41,099 --> 00:14:42,293
Have you been well?

211
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:44,775
What is this?

212
00:14:46,003 --> 00:14:47,230
Was it a lie?

213
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:52,144
It was all a lie.

214
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:55,968
It was a lie. It was all a lie!

215
00:14:56,769 --> 00:14:58,308
What do you think you're doing?

216
00:15:01,096 --> 00:15:03,319
Are you okay? I was just...

217
00:15:04,149 --> 00:15:07,506
Forget it. Don't talk to me.
Don't even follow me.

218
00:15:20,572 --> 00:15:22,635
Dr. Kang, have some.
They taste really good.

219
00:15:22,749 --> 00:15:24,039
I'll eat later. Leave some for me.

220
00:15:24,146 --> 00:15:26,674
What should I leave you? A lot of meat?

221
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,313
Did something happen?

222
00:15:33,978 --> 00:15:35,773
-I made her cry.
-Already?

223
00:15:36,088 --> 00:15:38,207
I'm shocked at myself as well.

224
00:15:52,046 --> 00:15:52,962
Wait.

225
00:15:53,751 --> 00:15:54,664
I'm sorry.

226
00:15:56,275 --> 00:15:57,156
My joke went too far,

227
00:15:57,265 --> 00:15:58,512
because I spend most of my time
with the guys.

228
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,902
I'm really sorry.

229
00:16:03,902 --> 00:16:05,076
Okay.

230
00:16:48,961 --> 00:16:52,699
It's nice to meet you again.

231
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:20,152
Head count!

232
00:17:20,268 --> 00:17:21,035
-One!
-Two!

233
00:17:21,139 --> 00:17:21,749
-Three!
-Four!

234
00:17:21,837 --> 00:17:22,508
-Five!
-Six!

235
00:17:22,627 --> 00:17:23,321
-Seven!
-Eight!

236
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,233
Nine! End of count!

237
00:17:24,341 --> 00:17:25,852
Total count, nine. None missing.

238
00:17:25,996 --> 00:17:28,060
All here, ready for lights out!

239
00:17:28,187 --> 00:17:29,584
-Rest.
-Rest.

240
00:17:30,871 --> 00:17:32,444
Private Kim Gibeom.

241
00:17:36,642 --> 00:17:37,300
Hey!

242
00:17:39,922 --> 00:17:41,735
-Are you alright?
-Yes.

243
00:18:16,851 --> 00:18:19,599
They probably do this
every morning, right?

244
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:24,216
If they do this at night too,
I'll just live here.

245
00:18:24,327 --> 00:18:26,153
Let me know as soon as you decide.

246
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:27,475
So that I can retrieve my rent deposit.

247
00:18:35,313 --> 00:18:37,036
It seems like you can't sleep
because it's too noisy.

248
00:18:37,422 --> 00:18:40,554
I'm sorry but can you move
to the side a little bit?

249
00:18:45,186 --> 00:18:47,074
What's the schedule
for the medical team today?

250
00:18:47,195 --> 00:18:48,569
Morning or afternoon?

251
00:18:51,796 --> 00:18:53,422
Head of the group, halt in place.

252
00:18:54,372 --> 00:18:55,502
Stand still.

253
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:56,622
-One, two!
-One, two!

254
00:18:56,752 --> 00:18:58,146
End your morning run.

255
00:18:58,617 --> 00:19:00,154
Everyone, quickly head back
to the barracks.

256
00:19:00,297 --> 00:19:00,837
Dismissed.

257
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:01,995
-Dismissed!
-Dismissed!

258
00:19:02,104 --> 00:19:04,272
-Turn around!
-Turn around!

259
00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:07,204
Morning and afternoon.

260
00:19:08,768 --> 00:19:09,855
What is it like?

261
00:19:46,266 --> 00:19:46,934
Here.

262
00:19:47,712 --> 00:19:48,920
Hey, hey!

263
00:19:51,322 --> 00:19:53,084
It'll hurt a lot when I draw blood.

264
00:19:53,221 --> 00:19:55,030
I usually like pain, Doctor.

265
00:19:57,358 --> 00:19:58,254
What's going on?

266
00:19:58,382 --> 00:20:00,628
-Salute.
-Salute.

267
00:20:03,894 --> 00:20:04,890
Excuse me.

268
00:20:05,529 --> 00:20:07,059
You should have it done first.

269
00:20:07,176 --> 00:20:08,497
Don't just go.

270
00:20:11,226 --> 00:20:12,664
It's going to sting.

271
00:20:16,376 --> 00:20:19,677
That's weird. Why can't I find the vein?

272
00:20:21,609 --> 00:20:23,376
An officer always carries around a gun.

273
00:20:23,495 --> 00:20:24,534
A loaded one.

274
00:20:24,646 --> 00:20:27,201
Really? Then you should shoot me.

275
00:20:28,526 --> 00:20:29,860
Is it here?

276
00:20:32,369 --> 00:20:34,235
I haven't put it in yet.

277
00:20:41,981 --> 00:20:44,912
If you're still angry about yesterday...

278
00:20:45,023 --> 00:20:45,896
My gosh.

279
00:20:46,054 --> 00:20:48,801
I don't hold grudges
over those kind of things.

280
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,221
Is it here?

281
00:20:52,354 --> 00:20:53,110
It's here.

282
00:21:00,878 --> 00:21:02,459
You have to fill the vial with the blood.

283
00:21:02,973 --> 00:21:03,809
Yes.

284
00:21:07,945 --> 00:21:09,764
-You've all been working hard.
-Yes, sir.

285
00:21:09,859 --> 00:21:11,686
-Hello.
-Have you eaten?

286
00:21:11,921 --> 00:21:13,480
You've worked hard.

287
00:21:13,838 --> 00:21:15,623
Have you received the packages
for the workers?

288
00:21:16,118 --> 00:21:17,488
I came to collect them,

289
00:21:17,584 --> 00:21:19,540
and thought I should say hi.

290
00:21:20,289 --> 00:21:22,035
Thank you as always.

291
00:21:22,229 --> 00:21:24,645
You must have a lot of packages
to handle yourself.

292
00:21:24,927 --> 00:21:26,119
Don't mention it.

293
00:21:26,595 --> 00:21:29,348
You should come this weekend...

294
00:21:34,014 --> 00:21:34,909
What was that?

295
00:21:38,206 --> 00:21:39,134
This is your commanding officer.

296
00:21:39,269 --> 00:21:40,642
Report the situation
of main gate's guard post.

297
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:42,102
There is nothing out of the ordinary.

298
00:21:42,253 --> 00:21:44,396
Maybe an accident happened
on the mountainous road.

299
00:21:45,146 --> 00:21:46,691
If it's the mountainous road...

300
00:21:47,523 --> 00:21:49,665
Did one of our dump trucks flipped over?

301
00:22:17,446 --> 00:22:19,618
The vehicle looks like a UN cargo truck.

302
00:22:20,262 --> 00:22:21,858
We will check if there is any survivor.

303
00:22:51,461 --> 00:22:52,581
Freeze! Hands up!

304
00:22:52,686 --> 00:22:54,250
Don't shoot!

305
00:22:54,518 --> 00:22:56,226
I'm from the UN.

306
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:06,922
I'm hurt.

307
00:23:07,417 --> 00:23:09,852
I need treatment.

308
00:23:36,413 --> 00:23:38,004
He's not a UN's aid worker?

309
00:23:38,901 --> 00:23:40,607
UN aid workers
aren't allowed to carry guns.

310
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:42,294
But he has a gun.

311
00:23:43,373 --> 00:23:45,285
They have tattoos from foreign legions,

312
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:47,071
and their clothes don't fit properly.

313
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:49,847
So, why are they pretending
to be from the UN?

314
00:23:59,814 --> 00:24:01,115
After checking with the UN,

315
00:24:01,235 --> 00:24:03,450
their identification card
and vehicle were all fake.

316
00:24:04,446 --> 00:24:07,837
We appreciate all your help.

317
00:24:08,837 --> 00:24:09,670
Thank you.

318
00:24:09,806 --> 00:24:10,646
Thank you, sir.

319
00:24:18,006 --> 00:24:20,085
We will need to report this
to the headquarters.

320
00:24:20,414 --> 00:24:22,482
Reports are probably already stacked.

321
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:27,855
Salute!

322
00:24:30,021 --> 00:24:32,490
Are you alright? Is anyone hurt?

323
00:24:33,026 --> 00:24:34,500
It was just a car accident.

324
00:24:34,795 --> 00:24:36,311
Everyone must have been flustered.
Is everyone okay?

325
00:24:36,454 --> 00:24:39,343
Well, we're all used to emergencies.

326
00:24:39,466 --> 00:24:40,324
That's a relief.

327
00:24:40,878 --> 00:24:42,140
I'll get going because I have work to do.

328
00:24:43,346 --> 00:24:45,270
-I'm going to stop by the headquarters.
-Yes, sir.

329
00:24:47,826 --> 00:24:50,708
I'm sorry, but can I get
the wifi password?

330
00:24:50,834 --> 00:24:52,524
Are you talking about the base's wifi?

331
00:24:52,902 --> 00:24:55,719
I apologize, but civilians
are not allowed to use the wifi.

332
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:56,909
Security rules.

333
00:24:57,106 --> 00:24:58,494
Really?

334
00:24:59,796 --> 00:25:02,486
-What should I do...
-There's an internet cafe in the city.

335
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:05,441
Captain Yoo will drive pass by it.

336
00:25:05,956 --> 00:25:07,441
He can probably give you a ride.

337
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:08,881
Am I right?

338
00:25:10,853 --> 00:25:11,783
Sergeant Major Seo,

339
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,041
did you eat something wrong?

340
00:25:14,618 --> 00:25:16,282
Don't worry about me,
and have a safe trip.

341
00:25:16,543 --> 00:25:17,330
Salute!

342
00:25:36,106 --> 00:25:38,970
Yes. I can make the down payment now.

343
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:42,591
I'm overseas but I can do internet banking
with my phone.

344
00:25:43,153 --> 00:25:43,874
Yes.

345
00:25:44,264 --> 00:25:47,510
Then, I'll send it in an hour
and text you.

346
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:48,691
Yes.

347
00:25:51,922 --> 00:25:52,936
Are you moving?

348
00:25:53,137 --> 00:25:54,023
No.

349
00:25:54,415 --> 00:25:56,455
I'm going to quit working at the hospital
and open my own clinic.

350
00:25:56,926 --> 00:25:58,699
Is it because of
your scandal with the chairman?

351
00:25:59,566 --> 00:26:00,478
How did you know?

352
00:26:00,606 --> 00:26:02,179
That's the only thing
the medical team talks about,

353
00:26:02,526 --> 00:26:04,216
whenever you're gone.

354
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:09,637
I guess he wasn't a good guy.

355
00:26:10,375 --> 00:26:12,637
I wouldn't have come here
if he was a good guy.

356
00:26:14,094 --> 00:26:16,570
I didn't step down
for you to meet that kind of man.

357
00:26:16,678 --> 00:26:17,903
I didn't meet him but...

358
00:26:19,046 --> 00:26:20,094
It's too long to explain.

359
00:26:20,205 --> 00:26:23,931
Anyway, the behind story
of why I came here wasn't that pretty.

360
00:26:28,484 --> 00:26:29,746
What is that place?

361
00:26:36,086 --> 00:26:37,215
It's far.

362
00:26:38,313 --> 00:26:39,908
Did I ask about the distance?

363
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:44,289
But did you just get irritated at me?

364
00:26:44,429 --> 00:26:46,514
-Who did?
-You're throwing a fit right now.

365
00:26:46,609 --> 00:26:48,053
About what?

366
00:26:57,934 --> 00:27:00,347
This is the closest downtown.

367
00:27:00,846 --> 00:27:02,339
Memorize the landmark.

368
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:04,656
I might not be able
to come with you next time.

369
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:06,593
Okay.

370
00:27:13,885 --> 00:27:14,853
Wait.

371
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,785
You just need to use the internet, right?

372
00:27:27,542 --> 00:27:28,951
This wasn't the place
I planned to bring you to,

373
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:30,962
but this place has faster internet.

374
00:27:32,054 --> 00:27:33,089
Anyone here?

375
00:27:34,826 --> 00:27:36,928
It's that guy who acted arrogant before.

376
00:27:38,926 --> 00:27:40,439
Did the owner change?

377
00:27:41,109 --> 00:27:42,322
Isn't this Daniel's shop?

378
00:27:42,441 --> 00:27:44,825
Did Daniel say that this is his shop?

379
00:27:44,952 --> 00:27:47,206
Daniel and I are both the owners.

380
00:27:48,428 --> 00:27:49,830
Then, Daniel...

381
00:27:50,198 --> 00:27:50,802
Well...

382
00:27:51,405 --> 00:27:53,341
I heard he was banned from entering Korea.

383
00:27:53,686 --> 00:27:55,150
I don't know that fool.

384
00:27:55,413 --> 00:27:58,622
Even if the ban is lifted,
he can't enter my store.

385
00:28:01,026 --> 00:28:02,533
But who is this girl?

386
00:28:02,906 --> 00:28:05,903
Is she a doctor from Korea,
who came here to volunteer?

387
00:28:07,829 --> 00:28:10,327
She is! That ethanol scent!

388
00:28:14,306 --> 00:28:15,326
Who is she?

389
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:18,592
Her main job is a nurse of emergency
relief team from Peacemaker.

390
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:21,100
This hardware store might be her side job.

391
00:28:22,506 --> 00:28:24,679
She does a meaningful job,
which doesn't give much money.

392
00:28:24,777 --> 00:28:28,290
I'm doing it because it's fun,
and I don't need money.

393
00:28:31,442 --> 00:28:33,768
But are you a fortune teller?

394
00:28:34,474 --> 00:28:37,061
How did you know my main and side job?

395
00:28:37,206 --> 00:28:38,922
I think I heard it from Daniel,

396
00:28:39,698 --> 00:28:41,011
about his Korean-Russian wife.

397
00:28:41,101 --> 00:28:42,221
What do you mean "wife"?

398
00:28:43,326 --> 00:28:45,683
We're just comrades.

399
00:28:46,723 --> 00:28:48,576
But what brings you here?

400
00:28:49,046 --> 00:28:50,960
There's everything here except Daniel.

401
00:28:51,135 --> 00:28:51,730
Well...

402
00:28:51,846 --> 00:28:53,555
Can we use the wifi?

403
00:28:53,929 --> 00:28:55,183
Wifi?

404
00:28:56,163 --> 00:28:59,054
Let's see, the fi is...

405
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:02,305
Are you sure the wifi here works?

406
00:29:03,626 --> 00:29:07,098
If you search thoroughly, I'm sure
they will even have missiles.

407
00:29:11,146 --> 00:29:12,586
Wait here after you finish your business.

408
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:13,906
I'll be back in an hour.

409
00:29:15,786 --> 00:29:17,772
I'll leave the doctor here for a moment.

410
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:21,654
Don't get into a fight.

411
00:29:23,066 --> 00:29:24,315
She has a gun.

412
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:28,625
Wait.

413
00:29:29,386 --> 00:29:30,642
Don't worry.

414
00:29:31,134 --> 00:29:33,357
I'm sure there's a modem
around here somewhere.

415
00:29:39,727 --> 00:29:41,156
On Friday at 9 AM,

416
00:29:41,878 --> 00:29:45,570
a body and a suspect,
who we assumed to be black market dealers,

417
00:29:45,746 --> 00:29:47,190
were passed over to the local police.

418
00:29:47,545 --> 00:29:48,862
Necessary measures have been taken.

419
00:29:50,014 --> 00:29:51,989
I got the report,

420
00:29:52,101 --> 00:29:55,570
but they're not some lowly weapons dealer
at a local market.

421
00:29:55,698 --> 00:29:59,007
No one knows how deeply
and with whom they are connected.

422
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:02,594
I know that Alpha Team have no fear,

423
00:30:03,326 --> 00:30:06,526
but they have neither fear nor law.

424
00:30:10,579 --> 00:30:15,707
You cannot pretend to be the UN
to cross the border anymore.

425
00:30:16,466 --> 00:30:17,869
They know now,

426
00:30:18,166 --> 00:30:23,775
and have even dispatched the
Korean army to patrol the border!

427
00:30:32,266 --> 00:30:33,384
We switched over.

428
00:30:35,786 --> 00:30:37,321
Take it easy.

429
00:30:38,031 --> 00:30:39,594
If things go bad,

430
00:30:40,309 --> 00:30:42,604
there's only so much I can do.

431
00:30:46,416 --> 00:30:48,894
Well, you know,

432
00:30:50,012 --> 00:30:53,113
I have my people in high positions.

433
00:30:56,386 --> 00:30:58,047
Dead presidents.

434
00:31:06,584 --> 00:31:07,668
Congratulations.

435
00:31:08,831 --> 00:31:10,192
You just got promoted.

436
00:31:13,396 --> 00:31:14,597
Don't forget your present.

437
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,653
They were smuggling weapons.

438
00:31:19,475 --> 00:31:21,173
In other words, merchants of death.

439
00:31:21,409 --> 00:31:22,968
It's best not to run into them.

440
00:31:25,396 --> 00:31:26,066
Hey.

441
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:28,221
You know better.

442
00:31:33,044 --> 00:31:35,213
You and I both don't have much longer
until we go back.

443
00:31:35,492 --> 00:31:38,258
You and I will get promoted
once we go back.

444
00:31:38,385 --> 00:31:40,285
Let's avoid things that can be avoided.

445
00:31:40,397 --> 00:31:41,317
Alright?

446
00:31:41,841 --> 00:31:42,795
Yes, I understand!

447
00:31:43,936 --> 00:31:45,483
Write the report in details.

448
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:49,483
Yes,sir.

449
00:31:49,666 --> 00:31:50,983
And take this.

450
00:31:52,355 --> 00:31:54,713
There is an order for an urgent transfer.

451
00:31:56,022 --> 00:31:57,545
For Sergeant Major Seo?

452
00:31:57,898 --> 00:31:59,620
It's an order from the Special Forces,

453
00:31:59,732 --> 00:32:01,913
by the Commander of the Special Forces.

454
00:32:06,219 --> 00:32:08,061
I understand. You may go.

455
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:24,213
Halt!

456
00:32:25,625 --> 00:32:26,853
Attention!

457
00:32:27,516 --> 00:32:29,140
-Salute!
-Salute.

458
00:32:29,269 --> 00:32:31,324
Company 3 and Company 5, all clear!

459
00:32:31,464 --> 00:32:33,094
Rest.
-Rest!

460
00:32:33,782 --> 00:32:35,617
You've worked hard for the training.

461
00:32:35,989 --> 00:32:37,592
I came here to eat.

462
00:32:37,719 --> 00:32:39,560
Don't mind me and eat.

463
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,616
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

464
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:15,937
Sergeant Major Seo.

465
00:33:16,056 --> 00:33:17,960
Sergeant Major Seo.

466
00:33:18,099 --> 00:33:22,000
You're dating my daughter, right?

467
00:33:23,097 --> 00:33:24,231
Yes, that's right.

468
00:33:26,619 --> 00:33:29,032
I'm worried about my daughter's future.

469
00:33:29,728 --> 00:33:32,640
So, I wish...

470
00:33:32,756 --> 00:33:34,496
...you'd consider
my daughter's future, too.

471
00:33:35,756 --> 00:33:38,343
I believe you know what to do.

472
00:33:38,842 --> 00:33:41,024
Using the wisest method.

473
00:33:45,096 --> 00:33:46,326
Is it a command?

474
00:33:47,306 --> 00:33:49,400
I don't want it to be...

475
00:33:51,046 --> 00:33:53,778
...but I'm thinking of doing it
if I have to.

476
00:33:55,516 --> 00:33:58,421
Until when we can be honorable
to each other,

477
00:33:59,316 --> 00:34:01,847
you will have to decide that.

478
00:34:13,609 --> 00:34:15,204
"Sergeant Major Seo Daeyeong"

479
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:27,275
Your gift is on its way,
Sergeant Major Seo.

480
00:34:27,703 --> 00:34:29,647
I miss you every day.

481
00:34:30,028 --> 00:34:30,861
Salute.

482
00:34:35,575 --> 00:34:37,027
Did you wire the money?

483
00:34:37,956 --> 00:34:39,103
Thanks to you.

484
00:34:39,591 --> 00:34:43,222
But did something bad happen?

485
00:34:45,603 --> 00:34:48,105
My comrade has been commanded
to return to Korea.

486
00:34:49,826 --> 00:34:50,840
The sheriff.

487
00:34:52,241 --> 00:34:53,349
Non-commission officer?

488
00:34:57,051 --> 00:34:58,241
You studied a lot.

489
00:35:00,344 --> 00:35:02,916
Are you envious that your close comrade
is going home early,

490
00:35:03,011 --> 00:35:04,654
or are you sad that you're separating?

491
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:08,891
I'm frustrated
because the command is unfair.

492
00:35:09,112 --> 00:35:11,301
You said the command should be obeyed
no matter what.

493
00:35:11,415 --> 00:35:12,707
This command is...

494
00:35:14,577 --> 00:35:16,928
...not by the commander, but as a father.

495
00:35:20,637 --> 00:35:23,653
This melodrama with the entrance
of Yoon Myeongju's father,

496
00:35:23,987 --> 00:35:26,064
means they're still screening?

497
00:35:27,882 --> 00:35:29,549
I've been curious since before.

498
00:35:30,121 --> 00:35:32,954
How did Myeongju
and Sergeant Major Seo meet?

499
00:35:36,186 --> 00:35:37,463
You can do it!

500
00:35:37,583 --> 00:35:38,630
-You can do it!
-You can do it!

501
00:35:38,742 --> 00:35:40,911
-You can do it!
-You can do it!

502
00:35:42,796 --> 00:35:44,249
There was a long distance march.

503
00:35:45,025 --> 00:35:45,825
Go on.

504
00:35:46,908 --> 00:35:50,742
Lieutenant Yoon was the army surgeon
in charge that time.

505
00:35:58,998 --> 00:36:00,607
I'll carry the military gear for you,

506
00:36:01,212 --> 00:36:02,696
so I'll kill you if you give up.

507
00:36:02,804 --> 00:36:04,777
-Yes, sir!
-Go on up.

508
00:36:13,475 --> 00:36:15,982
This is the third time
you came back down here.

509
00:36:16,122 --> 00:36:18,637
-What is it?
-Take off your boots.

510
00:36:19,062 --> 00:36:21,709
Love from your comrades
or getting the first place are all great,

511
00:36:21,844 --> 00:36:25,220
but you can be discharged from military
due to the current state of your feet.

512
00:36:28,015 --> 00:36:29,816
Sergeant Major Seo Daeyeong.

513
00:36:29,926 --> 00:36:32,762
Even if I do get discharged,
I'm determined to win the first place.

514
00:36:38,484 --> 00:36:40,658
I hope you are not trying
to win the first place,

515
00:36:40,766 --> 00:36:43,563
just so that you can go on a vacation
to crash your ex-girlfriend's wedding.

516
00:36:43,992 --> 00:36:45,261
Nothing like that, right?

517
00:36:46,286 --> 00:36:47,325
It's something like that.

518
00:36:49,048 --> 00:36:50,103
Really?

519
00:36:53,917 --> 00:36:54,839
Yes.

520
00:36:55,822 --> 00:36:56,736
Get off.

521
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,966
Why get off here?

522
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,014
We're going to that beach from earlier.

523
00:37:02,532 --> 00:37:04,585
It'll be better to go
before things get busy.

524
00:37:10,914 --> 00:37:12,303
You said it's far.

525
00:37:13,073 --> 00:37:14,105
Because it's far.

526
00:37:14,986 --> 00:37:16,577
I want to be with you for a long time.

527
00:37:17,066 --> 00:37:17,977
It's over here.

528
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,815
Sergeant Major Seo ended up going
to his cheater ex-girlfriend's wedding.

529
00:37:31,225 --> 00:37:32,445
Together with Myeongju.

530
00:37:33,466 --> 00:37:35,061
If you're curious, follow me.

531
00:37:35,224 --> 00:37:38,150
Together? Why did Myeongju go?

532
00:37:53,426 --> 00:37:54,712
What are you doing?

533
00:37:55,069 --> 00:37:58,110
Congratulations on your plan
to crash your ex-girlfriend's wedding.

534
00:37:58,295 --> 00:38:00,636
Lucky for you, I'm also off duty.

535
00:38:01,022 --> 00:38:02,616
Isn't that a relief?

536
00:38:03,703 --> 00:38:06,696
I asked what are you doing.
Is my question hard to answer?

537
00:38:07,077 --> 00:38:08,227
Lieutenant Yoon.

538
00:38:08,374 --> 00:38:10,410
Was my answer hard to understand?

539
00:38:10,585 --> 00:38:12,513
If you are going
to wreck her wedding your way,

540
00:38:12,632 --> 00:38:14,141
she'll probably be relieved
for breaking up with you.

541
00:38:14,244 --> 00:38:16,267
There's no way she'd regret it.

542
00:38:16,645 --> 00:38:18,470
But if you go with me,

543
00:38:18,851 --> 00:38:20,764
we can make her regret all night.

544
00:38:21,495 --> 00:38:22,789
That was what my answer meant.

545
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,768
I'm tempted.

546
00:38:25,714 --> 00:38:27,279
But I have a condition.

547
00:38:28,187 --> 00:38:29,890
First, turn the rear mirror around.

548
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,997
As expected of her.
She's an expert at breaking couples up.

549
00:38:43,747 --> 00:38:46,540
But what was the condition?

550
00:38:47,935 --> 00:38:49,633
I'll appear from here.

551
00:38:54,887 --> 00:38:56,773
The person that my father
sees as husband material,

552
00:38:56,885 --> 00:38:58,664
is coming in as your new commander.

553
00:38:58,994 --> 00:39:00,902
My father said
he was my Military Academy senior.

554
00:39:01,062 --> 00:39:02,459
Lieutenant Yoo Shijin or something.

555
00:39:02,601 --> 00:39:05,105
He already here.
It's been two days since he came.

556
00:39:05,235 --> 00:39:06,831
That's fast.

557
00:39:13,336 --> 00:39:14,528
Anyways,

558
00:39:15,432 --> 00:39:17,776
just say that you're dating me.

559
00:39:19,412 --> 00:39:21,447
You don't like Lieutenant Yoo Shijin?

560
00:39:21,908 --> 00:39:24,281
-Why...
-His looks is not my style.

561
00:39:24,865 --> 00:39:26,415
He looks like a girl.

562
00:39:27,969 --> 00:39:29,399
-Deal?
-Deal.

563
00:39:30,189 --> 00:39:31,758
I like your reason.

564
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:34,421
Do you like my uniform?

565
00:39:34,927 --> 00:39:36,919
I purposely picked a white dress.

566
00:39:38,231 --> 00:39:41,611
If I let down my hair and wear heels,
I'll look very pretty.

567
00:39:41,731 --> 00:39:42,945
Prettier than the bride.

568
00:39:52,545 --> 00:39:53,513
How do I look?

569
00:39:53,616 --> 00:39:55,203
So, the concept for today is...

570
00:39:55,329 --> 00:39:56,900
Can't you tell?

571
00:39:57,798 --> 00:39:59,141
Is it virgin ghost?

572
00:40:01,808 --> 00:40:03,291
It's an angel.

573
00:40:09,285 --> 00:40:10,214
Let's go.

574
00:40:17,055 --> 00:40:18,230
So, what you're saying is,

575
00:40:18,888 --> 00:40:23,285
the person Myeongju's father
approved of is you?

576
00:40:23,655 --> 00:40:24,265
Yes.

577
00:40:25,948 --> 00:40:27,241
Please wait here for a moment.

578
00:40:38,815 --> 00:40:40,990
-Let's go.
-Wait a minute.

579
00:40:41,635 --> 00:40:42,627
So you are saying,

580
00:40:42,746 --> 00:40:46,191
Sergeant Major Seo,
Myeongju and you were a love triangle?

581
00:40:46,587 --> 00:40:47,294
Yes.

582
00:40:47,642 --> 00:40:49,642
-Hold my hand.
-And it's still valid?

583
00:40:51,691 --> 00:40:54,223
-Yes.
-Then, how about your opinion?

584
00:40:56,295 --> 00:40:58,294
Why are you curious about my opinion?

585
00:40:58,739 --> 00:40:59,908
You dumped me.

586
00:41:06,285 --> 00:41:07,587
I'm just asking.

587
00:41:10,487 --> 00:41:12,234
I'm just asking.

588
00:41:12,496 --> 00:41:14,685
I'm not curious about your opinion.

589
00:41:19,075 --> 00:41:21,035
Your face looked very curious.

590
00:41:29,275 --> 00:41:30,203
Take a sit.

591
00:41:35,975 --> 00:41:38,007
Hold on tight. Don't fly away.

592
00:43:11,838 --> 00:43:13,775
This place is really extraordinary.

593
00:43:13,895 --> 00:43:15,490
How can there be a place like this?

594
00:43:15,971 --> 00:43:17,601
It's amazingly beautiful.

595
00:43:19,835 --> 00:43:20,930
Then, come again.

596
00:43:28,946 --> 00:43:30,338
People of Urk believe,

597
00:43:31,125 --> 00:43:32,840
if they take the pebbles from this beach,

598
00:43:33,506 --> 00:43:35,966
they will be able
to come back here for sure.

599
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:39,961
Here.

600
00:43:43,687 --> 00:43:45,083
You just made that up, didn't you?

601
00:43:45,734 --> 00:43:47,829
If what you said is true,
you think there'll still be pebbles left?

602
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:49,070
All of them would have been gone.

603
00:43:50,435 --> 00:43:51,907
The people who came back,

604
00:43:52,372 --> 00:43:54,467
must have put the them back.

605
00:43:58,895 --> 00:44:00,511
The legend is beautiful.

606
00:44:02,315 --> 00:44:03,752
That ship is also amazing.

607
00:44:04,768 --> 00:44:06,013
I can go in there, right?

608
00:44:19,355 --> 00:44:22,688
But how come this ship is here like this?

609
00:44:23,635 --> 00:44:24,550
Because it's bewitched.

610
00:44:25,585 --> 00:44:27,059
If you are bewitched to a beautiful place,

611
00:44:27,186 --> 00:44:28,154
you become like this.

612
00:44:32,695 --> 00:44:34,100
Have you ever been bewitched?

613
00:44:38,115 --> 00:44:38,995
I have.

614
00:44:41,139 --> 00:44:42,078
You should know.

615
00:44:57,035 --> 00:44:58,067
Now that I think about it,

616
00:44:59,376 --> 00:45:01,246
I still haven't get your answer.

617
00:45:04,355 --> 00:45:05,550
Have you been well?

618
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,405
Are you still...

619
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:15,301
...sexy in the surgery room?

620
00:45:20,591 --> 00:45:22,152
I think you misunderstood.

621
00:45:22,694 --> 00:45:26,805
I didn't come to volunteer here
with a good intention.

622
00:45:27,875 --> 00:45:31,984
Someone higher up dragged me down.

623
00:45:32,595 --> 00:45:34,455
The place he sent me to is here.

624
00:45:34,916 --> 00:45:39,061
And now, I don't do surgeries anymore.

625
00:45:40,055 --> 00:45:42,495
Surgery skill didn't take me far
in my career.

626
00:45:43,355 --> 00:45:44,942
I will go back soon.

627
00:45:45,062 --> 00:45:48,666
And I need to climb back up
to my current position.

628
00:45:49,315 --> 00:45:50,469
I'm very busy.

629
00:45:52,935 --> 00:45:53,974
I see.

630
00:46:24,671 --> 00:46:25,660
Okay.

631
00:46:27,562 --> 00:46:28,598
Here.

632
00:46:31,015 --> 00:46:33,075
This is how you should eat,
when you come to a place like this.

633
00:46:33,179 --> 00:46:35,347
You will remember this taste forever.

634
00:46:42,123 --> 00:46:44,853
It's ready. The taste is perfect.

635
00:46:45,157 --> 00:46:46,425
Prepare your spoons.

636
00:46:47,515 --> 00:46:49,062
-Dig in!
-Wait!

637
00:46:50,267 --> 00:46:51,585
I'll take my portion first.

638
00:46:52,926 --> 00:46:55,767
He always makes it obvious
that he's from a rich family.

639
00:46:57,151 --> 00:47:01,285
Even so, taking the egg yolk
all for yourself is just not right!

640
00:47:02,035 --> 00:47:03,186
Dr. Song!

641
00:47:03,829 --> 00:47:05,796
Why did you use the spoon
you just ate with?

642
00:47:06,255 --> 00:47:07,987
Seriously. I won't eat it.

643
00:47:09,175 --> 00:47:10,415
What I'm saying is,

644
00:47:11,009 --> 00:47:13,690
doctors should be hygienic.

645
00:47:13,807 --> 00:47:16,140
How could we eat from the same bowl?

646
00:47:17,975 --> 00:47:19,454
So, I just starved instead.

647
00:47:20,018 --> 00:47:23,437
Everything else is okay,
but we don't have hot water...

648
00:47:23,775 --> 00:47:24,697
You scared me!

649
00:47:26,311 --> 00:47:28,112
Honey, I will call again.

650
00:47:29,875 --> 00:47:31,120
Hey, you...

651
00:47:35,287 --> 00:47:36,623
Please give me something to eat.

652
00:47:37,175 --> 00:47:38,703
I heard you guys will give out food,

653
00:47:38,895 --> 00:47:40,713
if I come here.

654
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:43,769
I couldn't come yesterday.

655
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:48,410
Talk to me from there. From there.

656
00:47:49,355 --> 00:47:53,726
You can't go around touching
people's clothes with those dirty hands.

657
00:48:00,315 --> 00:48:01,033
Hey!

658
00:48:22,695 --> 00:48:24,615
He suddenly vomited and fainted?

659
00:48:24,775 --> 00:48:25,607
Yes.

660
00:48:25,933 --> 00:48:28,777
I think he has malnutrition,
so I gave him IV drip.

661
00:48:29,455 --> 00:48:30,963
His voice was normal.

662
00:48:31,843 --> 00:48:33,629
It doesn't look like he has pneumonia.

663
00:48:33,819 --> 00:48:37,797
But it also doesn't look like malnutrition
is the only cause,

664
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:39,533
because his condition is really bad.

665
00:48:43,395 --> 00:48:45,477
Pain between the liver and the spleen?

666
00:48:45,738 --> 00:48:47,188
How about lead poisoning?

667
00:48:47,595 --> 00:48:50,783
Lead poisoning
doesn't show acute symptoms.

668
00:48:58,396 --> 00:49:00,316
Was he sucking on something?

669
00:49:00,855 --> 00:49:01,499
Yes.

670
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:04,388
He was sucking his fingers
while asking me something.

671
00:49:04,823 --> 00:49:07,209
But I don't know what he was saying.

672
00:49:07,435 --> 00:49:08,456
That's dirty.

673
00:49:09,602 --> 00:49:10,545
Eat this.

674
00:49:17,047 --> 00:49:18,829
We'll have to start with detoxification,

675
00:49:18,958 --> 00:49:22,504
so give him high concentration vitamin C
IV drip, as well as EDTA.

676
00:49:22,622 --> 00:49:23,996
Are you saying it is lead poisoning?

677
00:49:24,975 --> 00:49:26,848
It's anemia caused by malnutrition.

678
00:49:26,943 --> 00:49:28,813
But because lead was ingested,

679
00:49:28,915 --> 00:49:30,606
the red blood cells absorbed the lead,

680
00:49:30,726 --> 00:49:31,986
mistaking it for nutrients.

681
00:49:32,155 --> 00:49:34,398
Acute symptoms are shown,

682
00:49:34,885 --> 00:49:36,697
because lead level suddenly increased.

683
00:49:37,815 --> 00:49:39,095
Captain Yoo, you're awesome.

684
00:49:39,847 --> 00:49:41,050
I'll bring the medicine.

685
00:49:46,327 --> 00:49:47,546
Let me know when he wakes up.

686
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:49,905
I can interpret for you.

687
00:49:50,375 --> 00:49:52,124
Thank you for your help.

688
00:49:55,689 --> 00:49:58,037
But from now on, let the medical team,

689
00:49:58,148 --> 00:49:59,767
-take care of medical...
-If you're grateful,

690
00:50:00,473 --> 00:50:01,987
then that's the end of it.

691
00:50:03,085 --> 00:50:03,989
What do you mean?

692
00:50:04,095 --> 00:50:05,514
You said life has dignity,

693
00:50:05,815 --> 00:50:07,820
and there's no higher value
that can surpass that.

694
00:50:08,995 --> 00:50:10,726
I'm saying that you are too different,

695
00:50:11,093 --> 00:50:13,000
from the Dr. Kang I once knew.

696
00:50:14,815 --> 00:50:16,607
Anemia from malnutrition,

697
00:50:16,767 --> 00:50:18,426
and symptoms of lead poisoning,

698
00:50:18,755 --> 00:50:20,756
are now illnesses
that rarely occur in Korea.

699
00:50:20,878 --> 00:50:23,196
In this country,
they are as common as the cold.

700
00:50:23,936 --> 00:50:25,666
Even if the illness is rare,
it would've been better,

701
00:50:26,619 --> 00:50:28,209
if the doctor who came knew about it.

702
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:29,666
Of course, that is true.

703
00:50:30,292 --> 00:50:31,166
However,

704
00:50:31,522 --> 00:50:35,387
not all doctors in this world
are like Schweitzer.

705
00:50:35,985 --> 00:50:36,789
Of course.

706
00:50:38,215 --> 00:50:39,925
Some doctors should be on TV.

707
00:50:42,085 --> 00:50:43,395
If you'll excuse me.

708
00:51:15,335 --> 00:51:18,089
The entire Medicube area is under FPCON.

709
00:51:18,207 --> 00:51:19,335
"FPCON: Force Protection Condition"

710
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:45,081
What's going on?

711
00:51:45,201 --> 00:51:46,621
Is there a war going on somewhere?

712
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:49,102
If that's true,
I'm going to treat the enemies too,

713
00:51:49,205 --> 00:51:50,411
since I took the oath.

714
00:51:52,425 --> 00:51:53,966
The entire medical team must gather.

715
00:51:57,719 --> 00:52:00,441
Is Medicube's field hospital,
the area of interest?

716
00:52:00,615 --> 00:52:02,766
A VIP patient is being transferred
to Medicube.

717
00:52:04,391 --> 00:52:05,399
How much time do we have?

718
00:52:11,395 --> 00:52:13,276
It's President Mubarat of the Arab league,

719
00:52:13,395 --> 00:52:15,599
who was returning
from his visit to North Urk,

720
00:52:16,095 --> 00:52:18,982
to establish agreement
on Middle Eastern peace treaty.

721
00:52:19,901 --> 00:52:21,963
As a royalty of Abu Dhabi,
who's third in line for succession,

722
00:52:22,127 --> 00:52:26,551
he's been leading political compromise
for sectarian conflict and border dispute.

723
00:52:26,652 --> 00:52:28,557
He is known
to be the power behind the throne.

724
00:52:29,135 --> 00:52:30,386
He's a strong candidate
for the Nobel Peace Prize,

725
00:52:30,498 --> 00:52:32,275
for his role
in the Middle Eastern peace treaty.

726
00:52:32,455 --> 00:52:33,592
But to his opposition,

727
00:52:33,688 --> 00:52:35,592
he's their number one target
for assassination.

728
00:52:38,335 --> 00:52:40,549
Get the car ready.
I'm heading to the Blue House.

729
00:52:57,975 --> 00:53:00,199
These are the medical records
sent by the VIP patient's doctor.

730
00:53:01,995 --> 00:53:02,809
Okay.

731
00:53:09,789 --> 00:53:10,884
What is this?

732
00:53:11,045 --> 00:53:12,050
If everything is concealed,

733
00:53:12,194 --> 00:53:13,646
what exactly do they expect us to do?

734
00:53:14,205 --> 00:53:15,507
In VIP patients' charts,

735
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:17,694
there are more lies than truth anyway.

736
00:53:17,815 --> 00:53:18,654
You mean,

737
00:53:18,829 --> 00:53:20,440
they record false information
on their patients' charts?

738
00:53:20,975 --> 00:53:23,021
What kind of crazy doctors would do that?

739
00:53:23,775 --> 00:53:25,011
Doctors like me.

740
00:53:25,995 --> 00:53:28,995
Like how poor patients
need doctors like Schweitzer,

741
00:53:29,148 --> 00:53:31,851
VIPs need special doctors too.

742
00:53:32,393 --> 00:53:34,813
Their medical history
can be their weakness.

743
00:53:34,955 --> 00:53:38,504
That's why a president's health status
is a national secret.

744
00:53:52,139 --> 00:53:53,196
What's the situation?

745
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,561
Nothing unusual.

746
00:53:54,673 --> 00:53:56,367
Emergency treatment is being performed.

747
00:53:56,985 --> 00:53:57,868
Okay.

748
00:53:58,633 --> 00:54:00,251
The Blue House has been briefed
of this situation,

749
00:54:00,392 --> 00:54:02,118
so keep me updated
down to the little details.

750
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:04,763
Yes, over.

751
00:54:05,054 --> 00:54:09,212
Blood pressure is 175/110,
and pulse is 100.

752
00:54:09,475 --> 00:54:12,903
Blood pressure is high,
pulse is fast and irregular,

753
00:54:13,022 --> 00:54:13,822
and he feels drowsy.

754
00:54:13,935 --> 00:54:15,156
This appears to be hypoglycemia.

755
00:54:15,267 --> 00:54:17,287
His chart stated that he has diabetes.

756
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:18,893
Do you think there's any problem
with his insulin?

757
00:54:19,015 --> 00:54:20,593
Let's take care of that first.

758
00:54:20,712 --> 00:54:22,935
-Get him 50 percent glucose IV drip.
-Okay.

759
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:24,124
Wait.

760
00:54:26,726 --> 00:54:29,719
This is a prescription
from the president's doctor.

761
00:54:31,619 --> 00:54:33,035
Nitroglycerin?

762
00:54:34,115 --> 00:54:35,661
Why vasodilator?

763
00:54:35,976 --> 00:54:38,035
He's a diabetic, so isn't it
the side effect of the insulin?

764
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:39,801
I told you that the chart
is not to be trusted.

765
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:41,994
If you switch the diagnosis with
the symptoms, it makes sense.

766
00:54:42,235 --> 00:54:43,987
He's not having hypertension
due to hypoglycemia.

767
00:54:44,116 --> 00:54:46,018
He's having hypoglycemia
due to heart problems.

768
00:54:46,585 --> 00:54:47,613
Please give this to him.

769
00:55:03,535 --> 00:55:05,155
His blood pressure is suddenly dropping.

770
00:55:05,544 --> 00:55:06,879
Set the IV flow rate to maximum.

771
00:55:12,295 --> 00:55:13,093
What's this?

772
00:55:13,863 --> 00:55:15,038
Abdominal distension?

773
00:55:15,915 --> 00:55:17,291
Hey, what's going on?

774
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:22,462
What's the situation?

775
00:55:22,625 --> 00:55:24,509
Abdominal distension
and drop in blood pressure?

776
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:26,077
Hemoperitoneum?

777
00:55:28,275 --> 00:55:29,672
He's bleeding into his abdominal cavity.

778
00:55:29,815 --> 00:55:31,984
There's something else
that they're hiding about this patient.

779
00:55:32,265 --> 00:55:33,859
I'll be able to tell if I open him up.

780
00:55:34,315 --> 00:55:35,280
I'm going to do an open abdominal surgery.

781
00:55:35,378 --> 00:55:36,957
-Get the operating room ready.
-Okay.

782
00:55:37,077 --> 00:55:38,213
Hands off!

783
00:55:40,015 --> 00:55:41,703
I can't let you do that.

784
00:55:42,045 --> 00:55:44,430
I can't let you operate on him.

785
00:55:45,195 --> 00:55:47,925
The president's doctor
will be here in an hour.

786
00:55:49,335 --> 00:55:51,708
What do you mean? He won't last an hour.

787
00:55:51,845 --> 00:55:53,347
If I don't operate now,

788
00:55:55,049 --> 00:55:56,180
it won't even be 20 minutes.

789
00:55:56,315 --> 00:55:59,989
I can't allow just anyone to put a knife
through the leader of the Arab world.

790
00:56:00,098 --> 00:56:03,805
You are not listening. He will die
if I don't operate in 20 minutes.

791
00:56:05,143 --> 00:56:06,123
Hands off!

792
00:56:09,505 --> 00:56:12,805
Only Arab doctors can operate
on President Mubarat.

793
00:56:29,493 --> 00:56:30,968
Everyone, hands off, and step away.

794
00:56:35,294 --> 00:56:36,086
Fine.

795
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:38,802
I'm not trying to change history here.

796
00:56:39,465 --> 00:56:41,732
But as soon as I take my hands off,

797
00:56:42,735 --> 00:56:44,179
he will die.

798
00:56:49,215 --> 00:56:50,855
His blood pressure keeps dropping.

799
00:56:55,085 --> 00:56:56,053
Listen carefully.

800
00:56:56,323 --> 00:56:58,201
Whether he lives or dies,
that's not the problem here.

801
00:56:58,385 --> 00:57:01,373
The point is who will
take responsibility for it.

802
00:57:01,905 --> 00:57:03,442
Do what the Arabs want.

803
00:57:03,598 --> 00:57:04,924
So if the patient dies,

804
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:06,734
we can put the responsibility
on the doctor,

805
00:57:06,848 --> 00:57:08,938
for not operating on him.

806
00:57:10,095 --> 00:57:13,508
Our force will not intervene
at all costs.

807
00:57:14,174 --> 00:57:15,327
This is an order.

808
00:57:27,492 --> 00:57:31,012
Can you save this patient?

809
00:57:31,386 --> 00:57:32,123
What?

810
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:36,048
I won't know for sure until I open him up,

811
00:57:36,293 --> 00:57:39,197
-but there's bleeding in the biliary...
-Enough with the complicated stuff.

812
00:57:39,483 --> 00:57:41,911
Just tell me
whether you can save him or not,

813
00:57:42,425 --> 00:57:43,415
as a doctor.

814
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:48,909
You bastard!
What are you doing right now?

815
00:57:49,018 --> 00:57:50,091
Answer me.

816
00:58:03,055 --> 00:58:04,436
I can save him.

817
00:58:14,055 --> 00:58:15,107
Then, save him.

818
00:58:55,505 --> 00:58:58,323
"Descendants Of The Sun"

819
00:58:58,455 --> 00:59:00,021
There's about to be a war.

820
00:59:00,149 --> 00:59:03,307
I'm going to kill all of you!

821
00:59:03,435 --> 00:59:04,998
His blood pressure is dropping fast.

822
00:59:05,101 --> 00:59:06,259
There's too much bleeding.

823
00:59:06,375 --> 00:59:07,423
What are we going to do?

824
00:59:07,562 --> 00:59:10,002
If something bad happens to this patient,
aren't we all going to die?

825
00:59:10,108 --> 00:59:14,012
Dismiss Captain Yoo Shijin of his duties
for disobeying command,

826
00:59:14,135 --> 00:59:15,742
and get ready to place him
under detention.

827
00:59:16,285 --> 00:59:17,880
Why did you do something that useless?

828
00:59:18,025 --> 00:59:19,339
Useless?

829
00:59:19,483 --> 00:59:20,880
Because of me, one person's life...

830
00:59:20,975 --> 00:59:22,509
I haven't seen Captain Yoo around.

831
00:59:22,645 --> 00:59:23,806
Did he go somewhere?

832
00:59:23,908 --> 00:59:26,020
According to military code, he'll go
to prison for disobeying command.

833
00:59:26,117 --> 00:59:27,419
How could you not know,

834
00:59:27,546 --> 00:59:29,578
when you're the one who argued
to proceed with the surgery?
