1
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,618
If you're a doctor, you must not
have a boyfriend since you're busy.

2
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:51,501
If you're a soldier, you must not
have a boyfriend since it's hard.

3
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:07,050
Power of unity.

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,350
BEST ONE MINUTE OF EACH EPISODE.

CHINA SURPASSES 3 BILLION VIEW ONLINE.

7
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,314
If I had known that I would die...

8
00:01:37,314 --> 00:01:40,183
in a foreign country, I would have lived a carefree
life instead of trying to become a professor.

9
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,454
Yoo Si Jin, are you on your way here?

10
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,458
You're not coming.
You're not on your way.

11
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,760
RUNNER OF THE SUN.

12
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,930
DON'T WAIT! THE BIRTH OF COUNTLESS PARODIES!

13
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,930
ENTIRE PRODUCTION COMPLETED IN 258 DAYS!

14
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,080
For how long do I have to stay this way?

15
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,720
STORIES OF KANG MO YEON BURSTING
OUT LAUGHING WITHOUT EVEN TRYING.

16
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:10,447
YOO SI JIN WASN'T ALWAYS COOL.
HIS FLAWS REVEALED FOR THE FIRST TIME.

17
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,382
This is more real, you know.

18
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,684
The star isn't always cool.

19
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,254
This is what's real.

20
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,256
One, two, three!

21
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:22,659
This will be fun.

22
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,665
He doesn't look out for himself
for the sake of his country.

23
00:02:28,932 --> 00:02:31,434
Special Forces Captain Yoo Si Jin.

24
00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:33,069
Power of unity!

25
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,878
For actor Song Joong Ki to became
Captain Yoo Si Jin in the drama,

26
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:46,316
he had to work hardest
on the action scenes.

27
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:54,324
I prepared a lot with our
martial arts director.

28
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:02,566
I knew I was going to have
to push myself harder.

29
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,170
Good!

30
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,147
Now, then.

31
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,800
He's quick and has an intense gaze.

32
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,870
Just because you are big and strong
doesn't mean you can fight well.

33
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:29,025
He's fast and has the smarts
to use objects around him.

34
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:33,196
We discussed that we want the action
scenes to be light and optimistic.

35
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,765
I worked hard to get
that kind of action.

36
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:39,936
Hey! What the hell! Huh?

37
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,760
Just say that you're sorry!

38
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,506
I'm sorry!

39
00:03:44,608 --> 00:03:47,877
Jordan who appears in this role.

40
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,381
I had a lot of physical scenes with him.

41
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:55,452
The person who played the role of
Jordan is Matthew. {Matthew is the best!

42
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,260
The beginning of the recording of the drama,
there were so many actions scenes day and night.

43
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,167
Yoo Si Jin jokes around
in this situation?

44
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,173
-You get hit twice...
-Right...

45
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,150
Have the camera come in closer. Closer.

46
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,260
Did you get in trouble?

47
00:04:20,377 --> 00:04:22,045
-Right.
-I got a cut.

48
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,760
You did it too hard?

49
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,250
My steps were twisted. At the
first step, I got tangled.

50
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:28,885
Ah, really?

51
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,890
Next time, I'll do something...

52
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,250
Unless you get a bigger injury
than this, you'll go unnoticed.

53
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,026
What do I do...

54
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:51,107
I was supposed to play
the role of a sniper.

55
00:04:51,441 --> 00:04:54,044
Because the sun came up, we
weren't able to film it.

56
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:12,862
The air was cool and I thought at
first it would be a little scary,

57
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,933
but it was fun.

58
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:21,705
It wasn't just simply
movements of the body.

59
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,007
Within each of those movements,

60
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:27,677
it was filled with meaning and emotion.

61
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,900
Depending on the action,
determining how to use your body

62
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:36,786
to show more of who the character is.

63
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:41,191
And he was able to show him through
that. So, the Yoo Si Jin character

64
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:46,730
seemed more real than character out of a fantasy.
Song Joong Ki was able to bring him to life.

65
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,665
Hey, guys down there!

66
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,690
Everybody, stop moving.

67
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,738
There were some realistic
actions scenes as well.

68
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,707
Now, strike!

69
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,778
You can't flinch.

70
00:06:03,012 --> 00:06:08,017
Is this hyung part of the
martial arts team? Actor?

71
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,154
He's an actor.

72
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,800
They dominate.

73
00:06:13,923 --> 00:06:15,600
He's the star of this scene.

74
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,527
Get ready for the next scene!

75
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,745
The reason why acting as
a soldier was natural.

76
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,653
It's only been three months
since I was discharged. Sorry.

77
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,501
It isn't difficult.

78
00:07:00,804 --> 00:07:01,790
So pretty.

79
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:05,975
-I think you can remove the sandbags in there now.
-Now?

80
00:07:06,643 --> 00:07:08,411
Just breathe.

81
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,248
This is it.

82
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,050
You ready?

83
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,519
Looks like you'll hit me.

84
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,856
Aren't the makeup team helping?

85
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,500
This isn't right.

86
00:07:24,661 --> 00:07:26,396
It's okay, it's okay.

87
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:29,165
They could edit this to look
as if we're bothering you.

88
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:31,267
Wipe off your hands.

89
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:35,205
Looks like you need to
clean off your body.

90
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,808
-Should I wipe it for you?
-Try wiping it.

91
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:42,312
You... you should wipe it.

92
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:50,320
One, two, three...

93
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,428
Hey, over here...

94
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,601
Actually, tomorrow...

95
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,537
Yes, it won't look good anyway.

96
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,440
-Answer me!
-Then save him.

97
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:12,175
Then save him.

98
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,811
That's it.

99
00:08:15,144 --> 00:08:18,147
Let's put this face on Joong Ki.

100
00:08:18,882 --> 00:08:20,940
Answer me!

101
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,085
I can save him.

102
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:23,853
Then save him.

103
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,526
Don't miss Descendants of the Sun.

104
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,201
Descendants of the Sun with Sergeant First
Class Seo, the third story for today.

105
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,502
Today...

106
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,272
Here is Song Joong Ki who has
the role of Yoo Si Jin.

107
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,039
Power of unity.

108
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,400
Please introduce yourself
and your character.

109
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:49,279
I have the role of Captain Yoo Si Jin

110
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,148
who loves Sergeant First Class Seo...

111
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:54,217
Love?

112
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,853
-Bro...
-Bromance?

113
00:09:03,526 --> 00:09:05,430
Why? That's nothing.

114
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,568
Does it seem as if something
will appear if I take this off?

115
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:22,478
Gross. I don't think it
was supposed to be like this.

116
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:29,619
They say there are a lot
of beauties in Urk.

117
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:34,123
Kim Tae Hee working in the
field, Sistar in the vineyard...

118
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,600
Should we change to Sistar?

119
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,950
Yoo Si Jin, AOA. Seo Dae Young, Sistar.

120
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,064
Rock, paper, scissors! Just one round!

121
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,465
Rock, paper, scissors!

122
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:43,960
Sistar!

123
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,569
I hear there are many beauties in Urk.

124
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:51,040
Kim Tae Hee in the field,
Sistar in the vineyard.

125
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:09,592
Hello...

126
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:15,632
A latte for me. Espresso for him.

127
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:19,002
I don't know if he knows
what he's drinking.

128
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,204
For this...

129
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,805
Nice to meet you.

130
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:23,673
Cut!

131
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,242
Why are they laughing?

132
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,448
Should I lift my pinkie?

133
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,017
Is it good?

134
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,790
Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday to you!

135
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:44,727
Happy birthday, dear Seo Dae Young!

136
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,730
Happy birthday to you!

137
00:10:50,767 --> 00:10:54,737
Isn't the subordinate going to
greet his superior? Attention.

138
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,540
-Power of unity!
-Power of unity.

139
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,643
Happy birthday.

140
00:11:05,114 --> 00:11:06,516
He has this kind of charm.

141
00:11:08,618 --> 00:11:10,353
He likes to joke and play around.

142
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:16,893
But when we go into a shoot, he's very
focused. I could learn that from him.

143
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:21,397
I think he does well at
controlling the tempo.

144
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:23,833
I will report for the
transfer right now.

145
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,980
I've been dismissed from my post so I
am no longer your immediate supervisor.

146
00:11:28,137 --> 00:11:33,242
Today, all the commands given by
my direct supervisor were just.

147
00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:40,283
I report to you, Sir. As of May 24, 2015,
I, Sergeant First Class Seo Dae Young,

148
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,940
have been ordered to transfer
to the Special Warfare Command.

149
00:11:43,086 --> 00:11:44,420
End of report.

150
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,022
Power of unity!

151
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,896
I am in charge of the medical team's
safety during your stay in Urk.

152
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,866
I am Mohuru Company's
commander, Yoo Si Jin.

153
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,769
The first thing that I felt
when I look at the script was,

154
00:12:00,369 --> 00:12:02,205
"Wow, it's a real page-turner."

155
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:06,809
The second thing was that it
was refreshing. Particularly,

156
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,946
the fact that it was a character
who worked for the military,

157
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,249
I didn't recall seeing that
in any of the other dramas.

158
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,520
Wow, a story about love between
a soldier and a doctor?

159
00:12:19,522 --> 00:12:20,656
It was fresh and new.

160
00:12:20,857 --> 00:12:23,092
It made a strong impression, yes.

161
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,530
What are you doing?
Please push it faster!

162
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,975
He's not masculine in the physical sense so much,

163
00:12:39,575 --> 00:12:43,412
but what he shows through
his eyes as he acts

164
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,449
is very masculine,

165
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:49,786
and also has an effeminate
quality as well.

166
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,950
For the role of a soldier who has an
overflowing sense of humor and justice,

167
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,525
I thought that he would be a
perfect fit for that character.

168
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,959
Just relax.

169
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,595
While admiring my sexy backside.

170
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,564
I missed you. What else could I do?

171
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:04,233
Somehow I accomplished
that difficult task.

172
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,872
It's quite incredible.

173
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,609
Really, just like Writer Kim Eun Sook
said, it's the ultimate fantasy.

174
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,812
Could a man like him really exist?

175
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,680
I am a man,

176
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:21,951
but this guy is really cool.

177
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,288
It makes me think, "Who else
could have been Yoo Si Jin,

178
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,790
if not Song Joong Ki?"

179
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:30,760
To that extent, it was a

180
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,595
perfect casting.

181
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:38,267
This man's patriotism which cannot
be found anywhere in this world.

182
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:41,871
The belief that I must protect the children,
beauties, and the elderly,

183
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:45,408
even if a bullet goes into my temple, the
conviction that what's wrong is wrong,

184
00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:47,510
and as a result,

185
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:49,946
the honor I uphold as a soldier.

186
00:13:52,148 --> 00:13:54,116
That's what patriotism means to me.

187
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:57,053
Yoo Si Jin's sense of honor,

188
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,487
his patriotism,

189
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,424
the sense of responsibility
that he has for his job.

190
00:14:02,225 --> 00:14:05,027
About these things, Writer Kim Won Suk

191
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:08,397
told me many different things
for about half an hour.

192
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:12,501
Until then, I only thought that it fell into
the romantic-comedy genre that was very fun

193
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,172
and that I could just portray
it the way I read it.

194
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:19,942
But once hearing what Writer
Kim Won Suk said to me,

195
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:22,578
I got the sense that there was something
much more sincere and earnest underlying it.

196
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,249
Ah, this genre isn't something
I can look on so lightly.

197
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:29,452
Raise it up and turn.

198
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,121
Now you point the guns.

199
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,423
Then save him.

200
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:41,831
Hold it like this and then like this.

201
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:43,799
Straight ahead.

202
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:46,669
The lines which the writers
wrote are very palatable,

203
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:48,304
but...

204
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:52,208
I had to constantly think about
how I could do them justice.

205
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,577
"I have to take it beyond the script."

206
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,946
I worried about it repeatedly.

207
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,549
For a few days before shooting that particular
scene, I tensed up because I wanted to do well.

208
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,521
Within that time, I kept
going over the script.

209
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:09,325
All of a sudden I thought, "Ah,
for these kinds of scenes,

210
00:15:09,692 --> 00:15:13,496
"I shouldn't tense up
but be more relaxed."

211
00:15:14,096 --> 00:15:15,231
I can save him.

212
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:25,875
Then save him.

213
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:34,116
Through just a simple comment, he
expresses his deep and honest feelings.

214
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,584
Yoo Si Jin.

215
00:15:37,286 --> 00:15:39,889
The one thing that was difficult was
that the wind was blowing so much.

216
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:43,125
He was emotionally prepared, but
the photo wouldn't catch on fire.

217
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:46,329
And because it wouldn't light up...

218
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:50,640
To be honest, the emotion that's
captured in the first take is the best.

219
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,769
It's not easy to act in that kind
of an unfavorable situation.

220
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:58,007
But he did so well, and from
seeing him cry like a child,

221
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:01,811
I was very touched as well.

222
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,682
A great scene that came out
of difficult circumstances.

223
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,931
When I first read that scene,

224
00:16:22,531 --> 00:16:23,766
I was very moved.

225
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,304
I believe that most men would
have the same feelings.

226
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,980
Agus was my hero,

227
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:35,644
my role model, and my everything.

228
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,348
But the sense of betrayal you
feel because of that person,

229
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,452
and the fact that I
killed my own role model,

230
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:46,060
but that it was a choice
that couldn't be helped

231
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:48,624
because I love Kang Mo Yeon more.

232
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,160
Because she is more precious to me.

233
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,631
Are you aiming for a head-shot?

234
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,803
It's a heart-shot. My
target is so pretty.

235
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:08,610
Descendants of the Sun. Just like the
title, the actress who shined brightly,

236
00:17:08,711 --> 00:17:09,979
Song Hye Gyo.

237
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,749
"I'm doing a project with Song Hye Gyo?"

238
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:18,054
"As lovers at that?" I
couldn't believe it at times.

239
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,057
Outside of shooting, we
helped each other a lot

240
00:17:21,157 --> 00:17:25,127
and was considerate of each other.

241
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,496
I think we were both
alike in our sincerity.

242
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:32,701
She's honest and outgoing.
And for a top star,

243
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,670
she has a very easy-going side to her.

244
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,406
I felt sure that she wouldn't
measure and calculate

245
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:40,676
but that she would be able
to just enjoy the character.

246
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,882
Doctor, and Yoo Si Jin's
lover, Kang Mo Yeon.

247
00:17:47,883 --> 00:17:48,100
You!

248
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:51,960
Even for a 20-year-veteran
actor like Song Hye Gyo

249
00:17:52,054 --> 00:17:54,390
some of the character's
actions were new to her.

250
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,428
You're already beautiful.

251
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,629
I wonder why?

252
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,232
Maybe because my eyes are beautiful?

253
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,040
Usually in dramas, you
don't see a woman being

254
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:10,990
so forward or be that opinionated.

255
00:18:11,107 --> 00:18:13,609
Even from the first episode,
Kang Mo Yeon was...

256
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:16,946
If you're a doctor, you must not
have a boyfriend. Since you're busy.

257
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:20,983
"If you're a soldier, you must not have a
girlfriend. Because it's too intense."

258
00:18:20,983 --> 00:18:22,820
Someone who could give
that kind of response,

259
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:25,920
I wondered how many female characters there
could be with that kind of personality.

260
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:28,090
The patient's head...

261
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:31,227
-Right over here.
-About here?

262
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,897
Yes. Clear. Clear shot?

263
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,665
It's so cold.

264
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:40,236
It was my first time playing
the role of a doctor.

265
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:45,274
To be honest, I felt a bit burdened, and
since there was so much medical lingo,

266
00:18:45,474 --> 00:18:47,610
I wondered if I really could

267
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:52,640
express all those lines
well and expertly.

268
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:55,017
I think I had a lot of
those kinds of worries.

269
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,294
Cue!

270
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:14,003
EVERYONE CRACK UP. FINALLY NG.

271
00:19:14,136 --> 00:19:15,404
Please prep.

272
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,440
What was it again?

273
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,940
NG AGAIN BECAUSE OF LAUGHTER.

274
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:24,146
I started cracking up...

275
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,348
I won't do that.

276
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,654
You told me I would be the
one to get it this time!

277
00:19:31,887 --> 00:19:36,258
Shouldn't skill be the reason for a
promotion at least once out of three times?

278
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,628
Why can't I memorize it?

279
00:19:46,068 --> 00:19:47,403
I'm not going to do surgeries anymore.

280
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:51,207
I'm saying that you seem so far in character
from the Doctor Kang I met before.

281
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:55,030
Not all doctors in this world is Dr.
Schweitzer.

282
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:01,116
Dr. Kang Mo Yeon's compromise with
reality that everyone identified with,

283
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,152
but...

284
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,688
In a foreign land of Urk,

285
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:08,524
she started to change.

286
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:11,427
From a doctor who does broadcasts,

287
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,530
to a doctor who aids patients.

288
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,967
Doctor! You worked hard today.

289
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:22,504
I teared up just by looking
at Manager Go's face.

290
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,840
He smiled so brightly,

291
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:29,790
but I had a memory of
that smile being so sad.

292
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,647
I was right in front of
the monitor at that time.

293
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,552
And I thought, "That's the cut."

294
00:20:37,052 --> 00:20:39,788
When I saw the episode, the
sadness came through so well.

295
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:44,593
That I will dedicate my life to serve

296
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,495
I solemnly vow.

297
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:52,334
Regardless of race,
religion, nationality

298
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:55,237
position in society...

299
00:20:55,938 --> 00:20:58,874
I'll fulfill my duty to my patients.

300
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,915
Now... nice shot, nice shot...

301
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,484
Where is it...

302
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,187
I'll run away.

303
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:13,856
You unplugged it.

304
00:21:16,792 --> 00:21:18,027
Look up at Si Jin?

305
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,680
It's embarrassing.

306
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:21,870
Ah, looking up...

307
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,300
You went there not knowing
Si Jin was there.

308
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,404
But go, take it, and check him?

309
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,876
You have to look up very, very quickly.

310
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:37,212
-Okay.
-Since you didn't know Si Ji was there.

311
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:42,418
I was hoping he would...

312
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,368
What's your blood type, Dr. Kang?

313
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:02,805
Your idea type? Beautiful type? A doll?

314
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,485
Do you like me that much?

315
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:18,810
-Putting my call sign in your car?
-Yes!

316
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,988
You scared me.

317
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:25,410
Anyway, I apologize, for
acting cute at my age.

318
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,528
I'm sorry.

319
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:28,797
I'll say that now.

320
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:32,267
I was embarrassed at times because

321
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:35,540
I did my best not to act
cutesy when I was acting.

322
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:40,580
More than emotional scenes, I think
I worried more about those scenes.

323
00:22:40,676 --> 00:22:44,480
I do have those side to me, so...

324
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:48,117
I was able to act naturally.

325
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:55,060
Do you remember? You
remember this place?

326
00:22:55,157 --> 00:22:57,092
Remember?

327
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:00,162
At this rate, you're not drunk.
It's more like dementia.

328
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:04,840
Chicken and beer... Great,
chicken and beer! I like it!

329
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,169
Let's have another drink.

330
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,390
Chicken and beer! Great! I like it!

331
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,909
Let's... Great, chicken and beer?

332
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,347
Ahjussi.

333
00:23:19,848 --> 00:23:21,917
Ahjussi, hurry up.

334
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,660
We have to have another
glass of beer and chicken.

335
00:23:24,787 --> 00:23:26,422
Hurry. Huh?

336
00:23:26,855 --> 00:23:29,124
How much longer must I do this?

337
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:30,392
Wanna die?

338
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:33,429
What are you doing?

339
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:38,780
I thought we didn't have
that scene at first.

340
00:23:38,901 --> 00:23:41,880
In the beginning, when we got together

341
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:45,641
to drink and talk, I got drunk.

342
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:47,409
When I get drunk...

343
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:50,412
I become very hyper like that.

344
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,883
I acted in that scene based
on my personal experience.

345
00:23:58,330 --> 00:23:59,354
I'm sorry.

346
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:03,459
Before I signed the form with
the Lieutenant Colonel...

347
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,595
For me that scene...

348
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:10,666
my heart was breaking
when we were taping that.

349
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:15,904
When I think of Mo Yeon, that
scene is memorable to me.

350
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,943
Song Hye Kyo's tearful acting
that made the viewers cry.

351
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:29,885
Her tears in the drama
meant a lot of things.

352
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:53,108
It was more memorable than
a hundred script lines,

353
00:24:53,308 --> 00:24:55,100
and there were some exciting parts.

354
00:24:55,110 --> 00:25:01,450
It was fascinating to see
her eyes filled with tears,

355
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:06,255
instead of dropping tears drop by
drop simply because she was sad.

356
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:25,040
If you become bewitched by a beautiful
thing, you become like this.

357
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,608
Have you ever been bewitched?

358
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:28,710
I think you know.

359
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,891
You look like you really
want to drink this.

360
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:48,430
It's not like there is no other way.

361
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:12,754
From the beginning,

362
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:17,693
the director told me to stare at her,

363
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:21,129
to gaze at her.

364
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:28,070
Up until then, I wondered about it
because I couldn't quite understand him.

365
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:33,976
When I was filming, I realized
what his directions meant.

366
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:36,745
"Oh, that's what he meant."

367
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,460
She's keeping her drink no matter what.

368
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,722
I'm keeping the drink no matter what.

369
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:50,359
It's Song Hye Kyo!
Song Hye Kyo appeared!

370
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,160
Hey!

371
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,058
Good.

372
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:25,394
I thought we were in a staring contest.

373
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:28,130
I won!

374
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:46,660
Her eyes, looking at the
helicopter, was mysterious.

375
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:51,253
I thought it was a
very appropriate gaze.

376
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:55,657
You wrote it here, too?

377
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:57,993
I'm sorry.

378
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:05,180
It's saying that's how
sorry my heart feels.

379
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:12,280
Quickly dismiss to your quarters.

380
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,408
Dismissed!

381
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:19,247
You really are hating me.

382
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:22,551
You're definitely too into it.

383
00:28:29,224 --> 00:28:32,027
After meeting a special forces guy,
I get to try all sorts of things.

384
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:36,832
Special Forces... I'll go again.

385
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:40,569
What are you going to do if
it's a man or a woman...

386
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:43,872
Cue!

387
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:48,176
Some very good wine just came in.

388
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,347
Some very good...

389
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:53,882
I'm going crazy...

390
00:28:58,687 --> 00:29:00,160
Don't do it like this, but like this.

391
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:03,410
Okay. Like this. I did it well, right?

392
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:04,880
-Just like that.
-Give me some compliments.

393
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:06,960
Yes, do it like that. Keep typing.

394
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:13,335
Like this and lift it. Then grab it.
And then...

395
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,604
You're pinching me.

396
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,774
I can really do it myself.

397
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:22,711
Ow, it really hurts.

398
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:25,747
Why don't you pull them all out!

399
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:28,016
Her hair got so messy!

400
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:29,918
I'm jealous for everything
about them to be honest.

401
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:34,956
Since we were happy only in the
flashbacks, and were always hurting.

402
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:38,527
Sergeant First Class Seo knows where
First Lieutenant Yoon is hiding.

403
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:42,430
He wants to hold onto
her but he doesn't.

404
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:46,535
For the sake of First Lieutenant Yoon's
pride, as she's trying hard to hide.

405
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:53,408
Because Sergeant First
Class Seo is a good man.

406
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:58,413
They had a fight, and First Lieutenant Yoon broke
up with him for Sergeant First Class Seo's sake.

407
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:01,583
That's why First Lieutenant
Yoon can't lose.

408
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:07,155
Because First Lieutenant
Yoon is a good woman.

409
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:11,020
I lost this fight.

410
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:12,027
Don't be like this.

411
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,195
I'll get going.

412
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:17,900
It's a scene in which you
will feel these two people

413
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:19,935
really did love each other,
and it's a heartbreaking love

414
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:24,420
that we had to convey in the scene.

415
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:28,944
It was a scene I worked hard on.

416
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:31,880
Don't you dare go.

417
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:35,317
Stop there. Seo Dae Young, stop there.

418
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:41,089
Sergeant First Class Seo Dae Young, you're
leaving without saluting your superior?

419
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:03,778
I came to do this because they said it's a
melodrama. What kind of melodrama is this?

420
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:07,082
Director, the water temperature
is different. Is that okay?

421
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,090
-It's okay.
-Okay.

422
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:18,800
There were many planes taking off.

423
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:24,340
There was lots of background noise, so it was
hard to get into the emotion of the scene.

424
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:31,440
It was really hot and there were many
complications in terms of filming.

425
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:35,610
It was an emotional scene for Ji Won and
I didn't want her to feel stressed.

426
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:39,314
So we purposely did a lot of rehearsals.

427
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:42,250
Hit him hard.

428
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:46,288
I don't think your feelings
are showing up well.

429
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:50,992
Let's think as if this
is figure skating.

430
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,929
You are Kim Yuna at this moment.

431
00:32:14,716 --> 00:32:15,617
My stomach.

432
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:16,770
We'll begin.

433
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:19,387
Okay, do a good job.

434
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,996
Should I do it closer?

435
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:28,997
Like that?

436
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:34,703
You two look very friendly.

437
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:35,970
That sounds nice.

438
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:38,340
Can't I be friendly with my man?

439
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:43,712
The weather is nice and the
man next to me is nice.

440
00:32:50,819 --> 00:32:51,753
Enter.

441
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:55,590
Are you crazy? We are...

442
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,500
It was really late at night.

443
00:33:09,604 --> 00:33:12,941
We were filming as we saw
the rising morning sun.

444
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:15,977
Everyone was tired,

445
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:19,047
and those four leads'

446
00:33:19,347 --> 00:33:23,785
care for one another were
present in that scene.

447
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:28,023
So, rather than Yoon Myung
Ju and Seo Dae Young,

448
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:34,095
I believe that because of Kang Mo Yeon and Yoo Si
Jin, the beauty of that couple was reflected more.

449
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:37,832
Whenever they are having romantic
scenes, we come here for a walk.

450
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:39,360
The mood is good.

451
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:41,703
It's been a long time since
we came out to watch.

452
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:44,500
When you two act out a sad scene,
we always come out to watch.

453
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:45,780
Let's be with them here.

454
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:48,209
Why are you doing that?

455
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:50,078
We're okay.

456
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,679
I didn't see it.

457
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,882
Take the scene.

458
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,853
I don't like him like this.

459
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:00,789
Look.

460
00:34:04,893 --> 00:34:06,528
This is my real girlfriend.

461
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:11,199
This is my comrade. We fought
together in Urk and won.

462
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,580
Should I sit in the middle?

463
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:29,651
Yes. Sit, sit. It looks cool here.

464
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:32,320
-Is this your first time here?
-It's my first time here.

465
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:34,189
Are you trying to get the best angle?

466
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:37,425
Should we take the intro slate?

467
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:39,494
Shin Bo Ra is coming in.

468
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,098
-Hello!
-Hello.

469
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:46,634
-We've never met, right?
-Yes.

470
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:48,603
Mr. Lee Seung Joon.

471
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:51,806
Our bachelor. Cute and loveable.
Cute and loveable.

472
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:53,041
Thank you.

473
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:55,076
And Dr. Lee Chi Hoon.

474
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,560
-Cutie pie.
-My goodness, thank you.

475
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:58,813
Cutie pie.

476
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:01,149
And Jo...

477
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:02,880
No, no, no...

478
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:04,085
The bad guy!

479
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:09,260
Actually, I heard we were scheduled with those
associated with Descendants of the Sun.

480
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:12,120
I ran here without asking
or questioning a thing.

481
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:14,929
Did you not come to meet
Song Joong Ki and Jin Goo?

482
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:17,132
Is that noticeable?

483
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:19,560
We noticed this much.

484
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:25,540
I'm thankful. After Descendants of the Sun got
so successful, I only appear briefly, you see.

485
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,460
-I'm only in it briefly.
-You had a big impact.

486
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:31,120
I never imagined being referred
to as being "the nation's"...

487
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:35,250
Does it make sense to have the word "nation's"
precede "disgusting trash?" It's ridiculous.

488
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:37,552
A reporter called me
the "nation's trash."

489
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:42,657
You must be curious what
we're going to do here.

490
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:45,527
What we prepared is called,

491
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:51,366
"Descendants of the Sun various chart."

492
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,330
Various chart?

493
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:53,134
Yes.

494
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:54,380
NOVELTY CHEMISTRY COUPLE.

495
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:58,530
UNEXPECTED NOVELTY CHEMISTRY COUPLE LIST.

496
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:01,376
Do you have a couple that you imagined?

497
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:03,790
Well... me and...

498
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,147
There is? Who?
-There is.

499
00:36:06,147 --> 00:36:07,482
Argus.

500
00:36:07,649 --> 00:36:09,070
Argus!

501
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,618
That's right.

502
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,253
Is it not?

503
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,889
Argus even visited you at the hospital.

504
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,830
Saying he came to see his friend.

505
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,160
I know. Why did you eat that?

506
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:21,460
For me, I thought it would
be nice to be in it.

507
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:25,900
Like... Seung Joon hyung
and I are always together.

508
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,690
Like this?

509
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:28,480
We also had one.

510
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:31,670
-That's right.
-I thought there would be some of that.

511
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,440
With Chi Hoon... Blek... Bleki?

512
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:34,309
Yes, yes.

513
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:35,543
That little kid.

514
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:37,478
Right, Bleki.

515
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:39,010
That's right.

516
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:41,880
I think there would be no end to this.

517
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:43,820
Everything would be linked.

518
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:49,130
NOVELTY CHEMISTRY COUPLE, THIRD PLACE.

519
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,062
Sergeant Choi. That's right.

520
00:36:54,395 --> 00:36:56,770
There was something at times.
Getting on each other's nerves.

521
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,640
Reprimand?

522
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,634
Why do you always...

523
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:04,850
I really don't like it.
Do you understand?

524
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,960
There, really...

525
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:08,570
I felt for Dr. Kang Mo Yeon.

526
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:12,080
Who is your sister-in-law? They need to be
married for her to be your sister-in-law.

527
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,716
Just follow the program, man.

528
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:19,053
For me... I don't like Dr. Kang.

529
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:22,740
NOVELTY COUPLE, THIRD PLACE, FIERY BATTLE OF
NERVES, CHOI WOO GEUN AND KANG MO YEON.

530
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:25,290
Isn't Kang Mo Yeon and Sergeant
Choi a bit unexpected?

531
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:30,910
When you look back, there are a lot of instances
where Sgt. Choi helps and saves Kang Mo Yeon.

532
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,620
That's right.

533
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:36,160
When you look at that, I think the
chemistry between them isn't that bad.

534
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:38,706
It's good? Park Hoon is there, right?

535
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,900
I heard that he's really fun.

536
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:42,010
Yes. He's really funny.

537
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,610
-He has a nickname.
-What is it?

538
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,640
Choively.

539
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:46,560
-Really?
-Yes.

540
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,550
He's Sergeant Choi but he's...

541
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,140
Lovely?

542
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:52,186
He was called Choively
because he's so lovely.

543
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,789
"I need to escort the Medical
Team Leader Dr. Kang."

544
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:58,626
"I'm preparing to escort the
Captain as well." Perfect.

545
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:00,962
Mission complete.

546
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:04,265
That's today's talk with Choively.

547
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,540
He's cool still.

548
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,169
He's cool and then...

549
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,260
The pain of a divided nation
of North and South Korea...

550
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:13,308
Did you hear him?

551
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,310
I expressed it with my camouflage.

552
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:19,580
NOVELTY CHEMISTRY COUPLE, SECOND PLACE.

553
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,316
Who are you talking about?

554
00:38:21,316 --> 00:38:24,830
You know that, you kept on saying things to me
about doing a surgery on a patient that was dying!

555
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,455
That old man who looks like he's
from Urk who reprimanded you.

556
00:38:27,455 --> 00:38:28,520
Captain and Lieutenant Colonel...

557
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,260
They're couple like that?

558
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:31,590
They're a couple?

559
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,262
Those two? Ah, so funny...

560
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:35,470
This is really a novelty.

561
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:36,464
How unique...

562
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:39,067
Lieutenant Colonel was also fun.

563
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,060
He's really funny.

564
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,303
Is that so?

565
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,306
I was thinking how he would be upset.

566
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:51,646
Hey, Yoo Si Jin! Are you
threatening me now?

567
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:57,251
If ever you are threatening me...
it is working.

568
00:38:58,830 --> 00:38:59,987
What should I do now?

569
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:04,080
NOVELTY COUPLE, SECOND PLACE, TOM AND
JERRY OF DOTS, YOO SI JIN AND PARK BYUNG SOO.

570
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:08,229
NOVELTY CHEMISTRY COUPLE, FIRST PLACE.

571
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:13,201
No, these people should come back when told to. Why
are they making my insides rot with such variety?

572
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:16,504
Is it just rotting now? My
insides are all rotten.

573
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:19,350
That's so unexpected.

574
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:22,110
I couldn't think of this.

575
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,113
Is this time for you to
have a debate at your desk?

576
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,310
Aren't you going to go to Urk right now!

577
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:30,470
Why would I go there? I heard there
is an infectious disease going on.

578
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,055
Why go there? Go and bring
my Chi Hoon in front of me!

579
00:39:35,056 --> 00:39:37,730
NOVELTY COUPLE, FIRST PLACE, FIGHTING
COUPLE, PARK JOON GEUM AND HAN SEOK WON.

580
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:41,796
Wow. Those two got
picked for first place.

581
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,364
Wow.

582
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:49,270
When I watch it, I wonder who is my mom

583
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,990
and waited for it.

584
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,180
In your script, it's not
written who will play it?

585
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:57,380
Yes. Honestly, I also don't
know how it is cast.

586
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:59,747
You have never seen her in person?

587
00:39:59,747 --> 00:40:00,920
Yes, I haven't seen her once.

588
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:02,220
We've never seen your mother.

589
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,117
Yes.

590
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:06,354
Then, a video message.
Even just like this.

591
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:08,055
Go and tell her.

592
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:13,995
Mother, I... I wasn't
able to call you Mother

593
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:18,199
and I haven't gotten to
see you and greet you.

594
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:23,280
Congratulations for first place. In the future
I'll work hard to be a son that receives love.

595
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:24,972
Thank you.

596
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:30,645
SWEET REVERSAL,
TOP THREE BEST SCENES WITH A TWIST.

597
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,514
Is there some reversal
scenes that come to mind?

598
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:35,970
Not a scene, but

599
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:42,023
for me, what's fun is the one where that
friend Lee Yi Kyung would be saved.

600
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:45,359
He was trapped under the
collapsed building.

601
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,428
He was waiting for rescue.

602
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:52,767
And then, I really thought he was having
a hard time and that he would die.

603
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:54,600
Then he said "It's so
bothersome I'll just die."

604
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:56,304
That's right.

605
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:59,307
So bothersome. I'll just die.

606
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,160
It was a short twist but
it was cute and fun.

607
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:04,070
Do you have one?

608
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:11,030
First Lieutenant Yoon, wearing that white dress
and moved to the front seat, and said, "Angel."

609
00:41:11,152 --> 00:41:12,920
I'm an angel.

610
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:14,840
That scene.

611
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:17,160
That scene is really pretty, right?

612
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:20,390
-It sounds like you're saying Ji Won was pretty.
-doesn't seem like a scene with a twist.

613
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,440
That doesn't have any relation at all.

614
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:26,140
Just... it was just according to
your personal standards, right?

615
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,602
That's great.

616
00:41:28,669 --> 00:41:32,650
SWEET REVERSAL, THIRD PLACE.

617
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:35,710
16:43...

618
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,478
Three days.

619
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,447
-That's just what you said.
-That's right.

620
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:46,220
I want to try no nights and 3 days.

621
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,110
I think that will be a trend.

622
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:55,296
Why? Like chicken and beer made a
big hit? No sleep for three days?

623
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:58,740
That is really an opposite situation.

624
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:00,001
Who...

625
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:04,220
Do you remember here?

626
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:06,641
Song Hye Gyo is really
good at acting drunk.

627
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:10,845
No, I don't remove my shoes
in someone else's house.

628
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,710
Are you seducing me right now?

629
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,760
Chicken and beer? Call!

630
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:17,040
I like that.

631
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:21,222
SWEET REVERSAL, SECOND PLACE.

632
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,770
Sergeant Seo, a package
came from Shin Joo Yeong.

633
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:28,860
-The package
-This. This.

634
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,699
Where are you right now?

635
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:34,520
They really ran so hard.

636
00:42:35,369 --> 00:42:36,837
Should I wait? Over.

637
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,774
The paper won't come off.

638
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:43,810
Look at how it's shaking.
They really ran so hard.

639
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:49,140
He's good at this.

640
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:54,021
Isn't there another one? Where
they eat the chicken soup?

641
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:58,125
You will answer together. Sergeant
Seo, is it the right or left?

642
00:42:58,430 --> 00:42:59,100
1, 2, 3.

643
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,880
-Right.
-Left.

644
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,599
-Left.
-Right.

645
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:09,804
Let's say you got caught in a situation
like that, what would you do?

646
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,607
How could I?

647
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:15,309
That's so obvious.

648
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,430
I would just kneel.

649
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:19,750
Just kneel and say sorry.
There's no other way.

650
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,080
Kneel right away. Are you tired?

651
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:23,920
-No, no. It's fun.
-How is it?

652
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:25,553
Then shout!

653
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:28,422
It's okay. The vibe is good.

654
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:32,790
SWEET REVERSAL FIRST PLACE.

655
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,898
Why did he shuffle?

656
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:41,736
That was so random.

657
00:43:42,937 --> 00:43:47,980
If I knew I was going to die like this, professor
or whatnot, I should have lived half-heartedly.

658
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:50,611
How embarrassed would she be.

659
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:52,810
The writer is really great, I think.

660
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,582
Scenes like this.

661
00:43:56,517 --> 00:43:58,552
Everyone heard.

662
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:05,280
And in the end, Joong Ki does
something cool in the end.

663
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:06,170
That's right.

664
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:08,195
That's why I took the fork crane.

665
00:44:08,963 --> 00:44:11,332
I needed to cause trouble.

666
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:16,030
When she ran and arrived, he looked

667
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,705
at the direction of the door.

668
00:44:17,705 --> 00:44:20,941
I got kissed by a really awesome man.

669
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,111
She ran out just like that.

670
00:44:24,478 --> 00:44:26,947
How embarrassing would that be.

671
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:41,095
It was worth to be first place.

672
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:46,100
That's why despite the actors you work with
in a production, when I get home my wife...

673
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,401
What does she say?

674
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:50,538
She would say, "Don't
bother my Joong Ki."

675
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:52,273
I worked so hard.

676
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:59,547
I was walking and ask her for water and she
would just tell me to go ahead and drink.

677
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:02,750
That's why the men of South
Korea are suffering.

678
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:07,088
This scene had the best viewer
rating in that episode.

679
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,830
It came to 34.6%.

680
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,024
It was worth it.

681
00:45:10,024 --> 00:45:11,180
It was.

682
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:20,868
SCENE STEALER.

683
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:24,870
These three are in the list so probably
that's why they were the ones invited.

684
00:45:25,005 --> 00:45:28,309
Or they got called because they
were the ones who had time.

685
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:33,180
We have too much time.

686
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:36,751
Then for what reason
we have them here...

687
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,280
For the scene stealer part...

688
00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:41,922
SCENE STEALER, THIRD PLACE.

689
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:44,080
Tell him to come here!

690
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:45,059
Here he is.

691
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:47,895
I wasn't able to be first.

692
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:49,697
What if you knew?

693
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:52,099
Even as I watch, I was
really disgusting.

694
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:54,440
Look at that expression. So hateful!

695
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:56,971
I feel so dizzy that I could die.

696
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:01,609
You acted so well.

697
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:03,500
Thank you.

698
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:04,411
You are really...

699
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:06,514
Be sure to put garlic.

700
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,349
You!

701
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:09,717
Please leave the site.

702
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:10,630
You leave.

703
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:12,319
Leave.

704
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:13,854
Move.

705
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,540
SCENE STEALER, THIRD PLACE, NATIONAL VILLAIN
WHO BRING FORTH ANGER, JIN YOUNG SOO.

706
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:31,806
SCENE STEALER, SECOND PLACE.

707
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:34,275
Oh!

708
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:36,110
He's here.

709
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:39,513
Pregnant?

710
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:42,216
Baby?

711
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:47,188
It will really hurt.

712
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:51,225
Will you be able to bear it?

713
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:05,940
-How long has he been like this?
-2 minutes.

714
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,540
-He bit Dr. Chi Hoon's arm.
-Lee Chi Hoon.

715
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:09,677
Later.

716

SCENE STEALER, SECOND PLACE,
WANNABE SCHWEITZER, LEE CHI HOON.

SCENE STEALER, FIRST PLACE.

718
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:20,700
I heard you were held hostage.

719
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:22,523
Professor Song.

720
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:24,430
Is this the first place?

721
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:25,400
Is it first place?

722
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,594
It's first place!

723
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,229
Dr. Song.

724
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:32,633
My symptoms are similar to the
virus, too. Haven't you had the flu?

725
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:36,170
Their usual conversations
are also very interesting.

726
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:41,442
-Those two look so good together.
-I was worried!

727
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:49,650
Whoa!

728
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:51,752
Wow!

729
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:59,240
He said he hated it that much.
It must be an event for you.

730
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:03,230
Dr. Song is such a great man.

731
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:07,270
SCENE STEALER, FIRST PLACE,
DEVOTED SONG SANG HYEON.

732
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:13,874
He is the epitome of devotion.

733
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:17,611
I was watching and his
smile was like this.

734
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:20,180
It was a smile that was so natural.

735
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:24,652
That's that, too. There was a scene near the
end where he was disinfecting something.

736
00:48:24,919 --> 00:48:26,353
Yes. Yes.

737
00:48:27,788 --> 00:48:30,300
When I first mentioned the folder?

738
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:32,660
The password was 1030, right?

739
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:34,660
Right, right! How do
you remember all that?

740
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:36,363
I'm really a fan, I tell you.

741
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:38,780
So she said, "10's to 30's".

742
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:40,768
She really watched our drama well.

743
00:48:40,970 --> 00:48:43,003
Please give me a hand.

744
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:46,774
I was the 1st placer,

745
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:48,609
but you get the applause.

746
00:48:48,810 --> 00:48:50,778
Congratulations.

747
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:55,416
He expresses any roles he plays so well.

748
00:48:56,230 --> 00:48:58,500
Is this the end to how you feel?
You are 1st though?

749
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:00,154
Well... do you give me something?

750
00:49:00,287 --> 00:49:03,057
Since you came in 1st, to your mother...

751
00:49:04,625 --> 00:49:06,393
A video message.

752
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:12,340
If not, how about say
something to Ha Ja Ae.

753
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:15,280
I think it would be nice to say
something. You had great chemistry.

754
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:17,037
Seo Jung Yeon, I suddenly miss you.

755
00:49:17,310 --> 00:49:18,605
Will I be able to see you today?

756
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:21,380
It feels like he's acting.

757
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:24,078
-It has been a while since we saw each other.
-She came to the company dinner.

758
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:26,313
Company dinner? That time I was...

759
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:29,240
What are we talking about right now?

760
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:33,854
You can talk about
personal matte rs later.

761
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:37,157
Anyway, a hand for all of you.

762
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:41,595
And also, to the three of you who showed
great acting in Descendants of the Sun,

763
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:45,299
it was a happy time to be
able to share it with you.

764
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:51,705
I know it was hard but thank you so much for giving
the drama to the viewers who love the drama.

765
00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:54,808
We are the ones who are thankful.

766
00:50:02,116 --> 00:50:04,051
YOO AH IN.

767
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:11,125
Then what do I do now?

768
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:13,827
Why would you ask me that?

769
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:16,230
Next customer, please.

770
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:24,240
LEE KWANG SOO.

771
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:26,974
The U.S. Delta Force team
used this gun in the desert.

772
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:29,800
I'm sorry. That's annoying.

773
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:31,378
I will start from the beginning.

774
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:32,980
He's not as funny as you thought, right?

775
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:36,310
THAT YOO SI JIN!

776
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:41,789
The target is safe.

777
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:42,920
LEE JONG HYUK.

778
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:44,958
Bang!

779
00:50:47,490 --> 00:50:49,296
Hurry and get on. Let's go home.

00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:58,539
MAY 2015 DOTS SCRIPT READING.

781
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:01,675
Hello, I'm Kim Ji Won who
plays Yoon Myung Ju.

782
00:51:02,570 --> 00:51:04,812
I'm Jin Goo who plays Seo Dae Young.

783
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:10,250
I'm Song Hye Gyo who plays Kang Mo Yeon.

784
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:16,623
I'm Song Joong Ki who just got
discharged from the military.

KIM EUN SUK.

786
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:22,963
I am Kim Eun Suk who is
in charge of the writing.

787
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:28,769
It was writer Kim Eun Suk
and Kim Won Seok, together.

788
00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:32,639
It's a production where
they collaborate together,

789
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:36,110
so it was a production that
I was very interested in.

790
00:51:36,677 --> 00:51:39,513
LEE EUNG BOK.

791
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:43,820
Please pay special attention to
protecting the script from leaking.

792
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:47,588
I want to shoot a melodrama with Dr.
Kang but it's a blockbuster.

793
00:51:56,310 --> 00:51:59,099
I was just discharged from the military and I
was asked if I wasn't worried about anything.

794
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:02,903
Why would I have none?

795
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:05,272
It would be a lie if I said I had none.

796
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:08,775
But I trusted in the strength of this script
so the a lot of my worries were gone.

797
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:17,384
Cut. Okay.

798
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:18,986
Sorry.

799
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:22,623
A place that doesn't exist in this world

800
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:27,628
but a place that seemed to
exist, it all started there.

801
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:31,331
But why is this boat here?

802
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:36,970
it was bewitched. If something is bewitched
by something beautiful, it becomes this.

803
00:52:37,210 --> 00:52:40,474
Our drama title is "Descendants of the Sun."
We wanted a place where the sun is strong.

804
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:46,947
In that place where there is strong
sunlight, an environment that is exotic.

805
00:52:56,130 --> 00:53:02,663
I'm Captain Yoo Si Jin who is in charge of
protecting the medical team while you're in Urk.

806
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:05,060
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

807
00:53:05,070 --> 00:53:09,636
We'll limit one military bag for everyone to carry
their personal belongings while you're here.

808
00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:10,837
What?

809
00:53:11,070 --> 00:53:14,007
In ten minutes, we will depart at 1325.

810
00:53:14,374 --> 00:53:16,640
SEPTEMBER 2015

811
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:18,612
Plus 10.

812
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:22,883
50 minutes. We will depart.

813
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:25,385
We will depart in 25 minutes.

814
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:28,822
1325.

815
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:33,393
I can't do math. I'm weak in math.

816
00:53:33,830 --> 00:53:36,063
Cover your shirt.

817
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:39,700
We'll take it once more.

818
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:40,880
Who are you answering to?

819
00:53:40,890 --> 00:53:42,080
Can the others not see.

820
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:43,804
2, 3...

821
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:51,278
That is the Medi Cube. And
that seems like our dormitory.

822
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:53,847
We wanted it to have the feel
of a dilapidated church,

823
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:57,100
but in that background we
would need a lot of people.

824
00:53:57,110 --> 00:54:00,921
Honestly, if we were to film it all abroad
we would need to get a very big budget

825
00:54:01,090 --> 00:54:02,400
and that would be difficult.

826
00:54:02,410 --> 00:54:06,400
Overseas filming in itself,
we could do it in Korea

827
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:08,740
but there were things that we could
not get in the overseas filming.

828
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:12,065
So anyway, we thought we
should settle it in Korea.

829
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:15,969
We decided and we got a place.

830
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:19,306
It took about 50 days to build the set.

831
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:22,240
You are with Sergeant
Seo Dae Young for DOTS.

832
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:23,660
-That's not it.
-Taebaek.

833
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:26,146
Taebaek is nice but the wind is so cool.

834
00:54:26,570 --> 00:54:28,815
It really looks like Greece, right?

835
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:33,887
The set is really fun. Self camera.

836
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:35,722
Can't you see the red light?

837
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:38,500
-Pretty?
-The main camera is recording sky.

838
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:40,594
Min Seok, sit here for a while.

839
00:54:40,850 --> 00:54:42,080
Icon of...

840
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:45,699
I heard that Song Hye Gyo
sunbaenim treats you very well.

841
00:54:46,990 --> 00:54:48,902
Please tell us in detail.

842
00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:52,360
-Do well.
-I understand.

843
00:54:52,370 --> 00:54:53,740
Then...

844
00:54:54,070 --> 00:54:56,143
Now...

845
00:54:57,010 --> 00:55:00,720
She treats me so well
and she's a sunbae.

846
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:02,282
Not that obvious talk.

847
00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:04,885
-There really must be nothing.
-She's pretty.

848
00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:07,940
Everyone in the country and a
lot of other people know that.

849
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:10,260
She's Tsundere.

850
00:55:10,270 --> 00:55:12,059
-What's that?
-What's Tsundere?

851
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:14,080
-What is that?
-I don't know. What's that?

852
00:55:14,090 --> 00:55:16,963
The type that's pissy,
but takes care of you.

853
00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:18,999
Do you want to die?

854
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:22,369
You mean she gets pissy?

855
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:25,072
Come in.

856
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:26,273
Wait.

857
00:55:26,670 --> 00:55:27,708
Why?

858
00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:29,110
I'm sorry.

859
00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:32,420
I think it's correct. Don't take
big steps. I'll follow you...

860
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:33,480
I will try that again.

861
00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:38,518
Wait. I'm Sorry. Being with just men...

862
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,120
I'm really sorry.

863
00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:42,989
I get it.

864
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:52,733
I'm blocking you.

865
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:56,370
I think this is good.

866
00:55:57,930 --> 00:55:59,373
It's nice to see you again.

867
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:03,777
Wait. I'm sorry.

868
00:56:05,410 --> 00:56:07,514
Being with just men,
my joke was overboard.

869
00:56:08,982 --> 00:56:10,050
I'm really sorry.

870
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:14,221
I get it.

871
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:20,527
The next time we go camping...

872
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:23,280
I sound like a pension owner.

873
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:24,731
Yoo Bin come here.

874
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:27,300
You have to keep up your build.

875
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:29,900
No. I lost at rock-paper-scissors.

876
00:56:29,910 --> 00:56:30,804
What did I do?

877
00:56:34,910 --> 00:56:36,280
You're so cool.

878
00:56:36,290 --> 00:56:37,844
That looks good.

879
00:56:39,790 --> 00:56:41,681
How would I cut it?

880
00:56:42,416 --> 00:56:44,418
Song Hye Kyo is here.

881
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:46,660
DOTS with Sergeant Seo Dae Young.

882
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:49,556
Please put a subtitle here.

883
00:56:51,370 --> 00:56:52,759
What are you doing?

884
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:56,520
Unraveling with Sergeant First Class
Seo. Who will you unravel today?

885
00:56:56,530 --> 00:56:57,330
Yes.

886
00:56:58,890 --> 00:57:00,780
It's Kang Mo Yeon who is at the back.

887
00:57:00,967 --> 00:57:04,640
Should we unravel Kang Mo Yeon?
Is there anything?

888
00:57:04,650 --> 00:57:06,970
She's too perfect. That's her flaw.

889
00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:08,730
-Right.
-She's a mess.

890
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:11,645
Yesterday, that expensive beef...

891
00:57:11,930 --> 00:57:12,913
I ate it.

892
00:57:13,290 --> 00:57:15,849
I heard she bought
Korean beef yesterday.

893
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:18,752
That's great.

894
00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:21,288
There's a rumor she's raising
a cow inside that van.

895
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:24,758
A cow inside that big van?

896
00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:27,093
Wow.

897
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:31,298
-That's good.
-Right?

898
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:41,408
We thought if this could be possible.

899
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:45,260
In a drama with a military background,

900
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:50,717
a movie-like and such, how
much of it is possible?

901
00:57:51,950 --> 00:57:56,022
The producers big worry was making the
earthquake scene be as realistic as possible.

902
00:57:57,050 --> 00:57:58,525
What on earth...

903
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:05,960
The earthquake would just be cool

904
00:58:05,970 --> 00:58:11,271
if only the visual effect was rich.

905
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:15,540
Because the lead actors weren't
experiencing the earthquake,

906
00:58:15,550 --> 00:58:19,180
I thought the earthquake
wouldn't hit home.

907
00:58:19,190 --> 00:58:23,100
I wanted to make the
earthquake be a fearful one.

908
00:58:23,110 --> 00:58:28,255
Using things such as
birds and other sounds.

909
00:58:28,490 --> 00:58:31,992
We took it from that perspective.

910
00:58:32,450 --> 00:58:33,460
What is that?

911
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:35,362
It's an earthquake!

912
00:58:46,610 --> 00:58:51,180
I... I've had my underwear wet before,

913
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:55,040
but it's the first time being covered
in powder. Inside, on my whole body...

914
00:58:55,050 --> 00:58:56,616
Line, line. Foot.

915
00:58:56,690 --> 00:59:00,120
The important thing is that
they don't know it's me.

916
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:04,190
I... They could confuse
me for Song Joong Ki.

917
00:59:08,290 --> 00:59:13,333
More important than the earthquake was after
the earthquake. The after math set.

918
00:59:14,090 --> 00:59:16,036
It would be obvious if we used CG.

919
00:59:16,570 --> 00:59:19,973
Somehow we had to have the
place to be able to shoot it

920
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:24,110
and thankfully, the Taebaek set,

921
00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:29,416
there was a vacant building so
we were able to shoot there.

922
00:59:29,950 --> 00:59:35,740
On the last day, we brought 20 bags of
gray dust and spread it everywhere.

923
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:41,840
When you look at movies or dramas with
destruction, you see so much dust piled on.

924
00:59:41,850 --> 00:59:45,865
I heard when things are destroyed
like that for real, dust piles on.

925
00:59:46,110 --> 00:59:48,540
When we spread out about a ton of it,

926
00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:53,740
they all became one pile
and looked that way.

927
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:04,551
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

928
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:06,860
-Here's the patient.
-Patient!

929
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:09,189
The Alpha Team gets off the helicoper,

930
01:00:09,189 --> 01:00:12,459
and while we walk, they
said they heard shrieks.

931
01:00:12,790 --> 01:00:17,764
So, Yoo Si Jin comes to
the rescue like the hero.

932
01:00:18,610 --> 01:00:23,169
I hear it was chaotic with
everyone not knowing what to do.

933
01:00:23,890 --> 01:00:27,841
But Si Jin looks for Mo Yeon
first without getting noticed.

934
01:00:28,810 --> 01:00:33,580
Mo Yeon is unsure, but her
eyes are fixed on Si Jin.

935
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:37,450
While I was reading the script, I
thought, "Seriously, what do I do?"

936
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:44,457
Wow, the writers are so awesome.
What do I do? Wow...

937
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:47,027
I got so excited.

938
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:52,599
And he says his lines... saying
he didn't want her to get hurt...

939
01:00:54,968 --> 01:00:57,904
Saying he regretted all this time
not seeing her before he left.

940
01:00:58,190 --> 01:01:01,007
Saying be careful. Then he takes off.

941
01:01:01,610 --> 01:01:03,710
Drives you crazy.

942
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:05,980
Where you see him is over here.

943
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:08,940
Let's try. We'll rehearse on camera now.

944
01:01:08,950 --> 01:01:09,716
Sorry.

945
01:01:33,707 --> 01:01:35,575
I was hoping you didn't get hurt.

946
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:42,982
I regretted all this time.

947
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:47,987
Be careful.

948
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:49,923
You, too, Captain.

949
01:01:56,410 --> 01:02:01,150
The responsibility of this woman as a doctor and
the work of a soldier was clearly different.

950
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,236
That's why they kept parting.

951
01:02:03,370 --> 01:02:06,310
Due to the earthquake, they
started working together,

952
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:08,808
so the melodrama worked like that.

953
01:02:10,050 --> 01:02:11,640
Come from the back and...

954
01:02:11,650 --> 01:02:14,547
-Please leave the site.
-Hey, you!

955
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:16,282
Get out!

956
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:20,487
Aren't you going to move? What's your position?
What year did you get out of the ROTC?

957
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:22,655
We're the army!

958
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:25,225
I said the army!

959
01:02:25,430 --> 01:02:27,710
Are you finished? That's fine then.

960
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:29,100
Cue!

961
01:02:29,110 --> 01:02:29,829
Throw!

962
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:37,871
Over there to the left.

963
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:40,774
Let me find the rock.

964
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:49,682
I'll try again.

965
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:51,851
We're doing it again
because of Joong Ki.

966
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:53,153
Cue!

967
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,557
We turned off the gas.

968
01:02:57,810 --> 01:02:59,125
So frustrating...

969
01:03:01,290 --> 01:03:02,896
Just rescue.

970
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:08,101
-I got scared.
-This is more real.

971
01:03:08,510 --> 01:03:10,403
The lead isn't always cool.

972
01:03:11,470 --> 01:03:14,374
This is real. Nice...

973
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:27,387
We did make sure it was safe, but

974
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:31,240
the actors themselves insisted that
they'll go into the small space,

975
01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:35,662
and we kept throwing
gravel on top of them.

976
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:39,165
They endured that and continued on.

977
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:41,434
I think parts like that
fit the characters.

978
01:03:56,049 --> 01:03:57,684
If you want to rescue one,

979
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:01,888
are you saying the other one dies?

980
01:04:02,050 --> 01:04:06,192
We rescue the one most likely to survive
according to the doctor's recommendation.

981
01:04:07,090 --> 01:04:10,830
So, you're saying I
should make the decision?

982
01:04:11,490 --> 01:04:13,170
Do you know how much
you're worth to Argus?

983
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:16,120
Ugh, I'm sick. Doctor...

984
01:04:16,130 --> 01:04:18,004
Call the doctor.

985
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:30,880
Blood... blood...

986
01:04:30,890 --> 01:04:32,518
Did you rip it?

987
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:35,855
Wow, this is sweet.

988
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:40,860
2, 3, 4...

989
01:04:42,030 --> 01:04:45,298
In our drama, it's not because they're

990
01:04:45,410 --> 01:04:48,268
doctors or soldiers that
made for a good drama,

991
01:04:48,470 --> 01:04:51,638
they take pride in their work and

992
01:04:51,910 --> 01:04:54,250
feel the sense of duty
in an unseen place.

993
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:58,611
If it's about a story of people who work
hard, it can bring inspiration to people.

994
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:01,580
OCTOBER 2015, BEGINNING OF FILMING IN GREECE.

995
01:05:01,714 --> 01:05:04,784
There were numerous
difficulties to film overseas.

996
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:08,755
Unexpected rain and wind
tied the team's feet.

997
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:11,691
The schedule was constantly changing.

998
01:05:12,910 --> 01:05:14,928
The weather didn't help us.

999
01:05:15,428 --> 01:05:17,630
There were so many scenes to film.

1000
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:21,520
But it rained a lot and was very windy.

1001
01:05:21,530 --> 01:05:24,270
Because the staff members
had so much equipment,

1002
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:31,210
they took boats for 20 hours for a distance
you can cover in an hour on the plane.

1003
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:40,830
As you can see, you may not believe what you
see, but all those tents that collapsed...

1004
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:44,380
and somewhat of a mess
next to the graffiti...

1005
01:05:44,390 --> 01:05:47,694
They prepped it yesterday, but
because of the rain and wind,

1006
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:51,410
everything is a mess. But they
like the way it's all messed up.

1007
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:54,801
The aura... so, the director...

1008
01:05:54,930 --> 01:05:56,269
filmed it the way it is.

1009
01:06:01,808 --> 01:06:03,142
The village is completely empty.

1010
01:06:04,590 --> 01:06:07,080
-You have to move closer.
-I'm sorry.

1011
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:09,916
Again!

1012
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:13,152
We're taping the Greece
portion for an episode.

1013
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:16,422
We're taping a goblin village scene.

1014
01:06:17,170 --> 01:06:20,126
It's not because the
real goblins come out.

1015
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:22,528
That's not why we call
it Goblin village.

1016
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:26,399
Because the kids
disappeared, that's why...

1017
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:33,072
-Naturally emphasize...
-Yeah, yeah, naturally emphasize...

1018
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:36,170
-It doesn't matter.
-It doesn't matter.

1019
01:06:36,180 --> 01:06:39,278
Say it any way you want.

1020
01:06:41,914 --> 01:06:43,416
How do I do this?

1021
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,425
Do you know what it means?

1022
01:07:00,830 --> 01:07:04,070
Most of the child actors were
cast in their native land.

1023
01:07:04,450 --> 01:07:06,973
Greece doesn't have a very
well developed drama culture.

1024
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:09,275
Many of them acted for the first time.

1025
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:23,489
-Now.
-Okay.

1026
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:27,827
Get hit in the stomach and fall.

1027
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:31,397
Bang, bang, bang!

1028
01:07:34,190 --> 01:07:35,501
We'll start.

1029
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:39,238
The Greek friends who did
the Fatima rescue scene

1030
01:07:39,472 --> 01:07:41,207
are student actors.

1031
01:07:41,730 --> 01:07:45,478
They came to experience the location.

1032
01:07:46,446 --> 01:07:49,649
They had a hard time because
we didn't quite click well.

1033
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:50,783
Cue!

1034
01:07:58,040 --> 01:07:59,959
Didn't it move too fast?

1035
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:09,268
Action!

1036
01:08:10,269 --> 01:08:11,737
Let me use your gun.

1037
01:08:12,870 --> 01:08:13,940
Now!

1038
01:08:40,170 --> 01:08:41,534
Now, let's go.

1039
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:45,130
I was going to say bye, but you ran off.

1040
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:49,180
In a very poor condition,
they were able to focus.

1041
01:08:49,190 --> 01:08:52,640
They acted very well
and we finished well.

1042
01:08:52,650 --> 01:08:55,930
Working in such a poor condition...

1043
01:08:55,940 --> 01:08:59,051
I felt so bad toward the
actors and I let them know.

1044
01:08:59,230 --> 01:09:02,421
We can try it and retake in Korea.

1045
01:09:02,610 --> 01:09:05,925
But when I reviewed it after we got
back, that scene turned out so well.

1046
01:09:06,050 --> 01:09:08,161
The actors... Actually...

1047
01:09:08,530 --> 01:09:10,740
compared to previous takes,

1048
01:09:10,750 --> 01:09:13,610
the lighting or filming
condition wasn't that great.

1049
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:16,090
It could've turned out not too pretty.

1050
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:18,504
But their emotions
were conveyed so well.

1051
01:09:20,730 --> 01:09:22,074
Should I apologize...

1052
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:25,578
or confess?

1053
01:09:36,722 --> 01:09:39,659
How did he come up with such
a line in that situation?

1054
01:09:39,850 --> 01:09:41,727
I thought it was very refreshing.

1055
01:09:42,094 --> 01:09:45,631
But I didn't think it would receive such
a response. People love that scene,

1056
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:49,335
so I was taken aback.

1057
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:56,576
When should we take it?

1058
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:59,378
I think it's scheduled for Friday.

1059
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:00,580
Cue!

1060
01:10:31,890 --> 01:10:35,414
The man will wave at you saying to come.

1061
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:38,184
Who's the angry woman and the
one who won't believe you?

1062
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:42,655
Sorry...

1063
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:49,395
Whatever...

1064
01:10:51,464 --> 01:10:52,698
Use the full shot.

1065
01:10:55,370 --> 01:10:57,780
It wasn't that location,
but it was that area.

1066
01:10:57,790 --> 01:11:02,040
It's a location where it
turns golden and green.

1067
01:11:02,050 --> 01:11:05,411
They burned it down
and turned all black.

1068
01:11:05,470 --> 01:11:08,414
We scouted the location the
day before and filmed it.

1069
01:11:10,970 --> 01:11:11,951
Like this?

1070
01:11:12,170 --> 01:11:13,152
Like this?

1071
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,230
Get away from each other and
then pull her neck like this.

1072
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:23,162
Ah, like this and then...

1073
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:25,298
Part... Good!

1074
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:30,890
We'll film you pretty.

1075
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:32,890
-I have to ask my mom.
-You didn't ask her yet?

1076
01:11:32,890 --> 01:11:34,990
You didn't ask? We kissed so many times.

1077
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,176
-I have to ask my mom.
-Should've asked already.

1078
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:38,611
Sit on this.

1079
01:11:40,050 --> 01:11:41,947
I think I just confessed.

1080
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:44,116
Should I apologize?

1081
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:46,652
How do you think I'd take your apology?

1082
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:39,338
THE TWO CRACK UP SUDDENLY.

1083
01:12:39,810 --> 01:12:42,541
THE REASON IS?

1084
01:12:43,175 --> 01:12:47,046
THE SEA CAPTAIN IS LYING DOWN IN
CENTER TO BALANCE THE WEIGHT.

1085
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:54,186
Move past this and like this.

1086
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:57,022
Do I come here alone? With my beauty?

1087
01:12:57,700 --> 01:12:59,892
Do I come here alone? With my beauty?

1088
01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:01,794
Give me another one.

1089
01:13:17,777 --> 01:13:18,878
What did you wish?

1090
01:13:20,290 --> 01:13:23,983
Please let this man kiss me.

1091
01:13:25,885 --> 01:13:27,119
Would it come true?

1092
01:13:29,755 --> 01:13:31,857
It's not like there's no way.

1093
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:49,742
-When the camera moves...
-I see.

1094
01:13:49,970 --> 01:13:53,612
About here. Don't look here then...

1095
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:57,149
Right then.

1096
01:13:59,690 --> 01:14:03,510
He wanted to do the action scene himself
as much as possible without a body double.

1097
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:08,327
Starting with the full shot, whether it was wide
angle or not and whether his face showed or not...

1098
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:12,180
He wanted to be in the
center of that action scene.

1099
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:14,800
He worked hard to overcome
the difficulties.

1100
01:14:15,390 --> 01:14:21,340
Those scenes worked out well, but
it did lead to him getting injured.

1101
01:14:21,770 --> 01:14:24,440
It was episode 14.

1102
01:14:24,450 --> 01:14:26,645
So many staff members
were nervous about it.

1103
01:14:26,790 --> 01:14:27,646
Cue!

1104
01:14:42,870 --> 01:14:44,797
Leaving one month to
wrap up the filming...

1105
01:14:44,997 --> 01:14:47,867
they had to face the crisis
of Song Joong Ki's injury.

1106
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:53,672
I felt bad toward Director Lee Yong Bok.

1107
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:56,208
Because he knows me very well,

1108
01:14:56,570 --> 01:14:58,677
while we were filming the action scene,

1109
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:03,983
I tried to get a perfect scene out of it.
I'm very well aware of my weaknesses.

1110
01:15:04,350 --> 01:15:08,010
I tried harder, but the director
thought it was dangerous for me.

1111
01:15:08,087 --> 01:15:12,725
And strangely, when the camera
starts rolling, I became like that.

1112
01:15:13,310 --> 01:15:18,063
I thought to myself, "Be careful, be
careful," but I got hurt in the end.

1113
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:26,038
Song Joong Ki came back to location in
two weeks. Despite his injured body,

1114
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:29,708
he worked hard and thoroughly
expressed Yoo Si Jin.

1115
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:33,312
You will not let...

1116
01:15:35,620 --> 01:15:39,010
I'm supposed to do that from
that point on. And from there...

1117
01:15:39,020 --> 01:15:40,753
It can pour down here and...

1118
01:15:40,930 --> 01:15:43,822
Do it one more time dramatically.

1119
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:55,180
I'm going to ask you one more time!

1120
01:15:55,190 --> 01:15:57,970
The scene from Argus'
home in episode 12,

1121
01:15:58,060 --> 01:16:02,608
they were all recorded
after he got injured.

1122
01:16:02,970 --> 01:16:06,378
I'm sure he himself was
very frustrated, but.

1123
01:16:06,590 --> 01:16:10,860
Song Joong Ki's acting ability
faced with that was unbelievable.

1124
01:16:10,870 --> 01:16:15,421
He taped that scene when
he can hardly walk.

1125
01:16:18,850 --> 01:16:22,194
I'll do it from the beginning.
It's almost there.

1126
01:16:23,910 --> 01:16:25,497
I would never let you die.

1127
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:28,634
But still...

1128
01:16:29,980 --> 01:16:31,503
There's 30 seconds left.

1129
01:16:33,350 --> 01:16:35,007
I'm dead.

1130
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:39,044
I'm dead.

1131
01:16:39,310 --> 01:16:41,080
Hye Kyo noona called me.

1132
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:45,551
She knows my personality.

1133
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:47,720
"I know...

1134
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:51,790
you're hard on yourself
and are struggling.

1135
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:55,227
I know, but don't."

1136
01:17:01,930 --> 01:17:04,603
Bite hard, okay?

1137
01:17:04,830 --> 01:17:08,570
He must've been shocked himself.

1138
01:17:08,580 --> 01:17:11,777
He didn't have many filming
days left and he got hurt.

1139
01:17:11,990 --> 01:17:15,350
He felt so bad and was struggling.

1140
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:19,618
Thankfully, if you watch episode 15...

1141
01:17:19,860 --> 01:17:23,080
Captain Yoo disappears and the
times I struggled alone...

1142
01:17:23,090 --> 01:17:25,424
That portion remained.

1143
01:17:25,950 --> 01:17:28,594
So, I said I'd film that portion first.

1144
01:17:30,930 --> 01:17:32,598
You got my coat perfectly.

1145
01:17:32,610 --> 01:17:36,235
I'm sorry, what do I do? I'm
ruining your clothes even.

1146
01:17:36,950 --> 01:17:38,537
Ugh, I don't want to.

1147
01:17:38,990 --> 01:17:40,506
Put it on.

1148
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:52,284
Why can't a Special Forces soldier clean fish?
You can even come back to life after dying.

1149
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:54,687
I won't get hurt or die, but...

1150
01:17:56,030 --> 01:17:57,890
I can't touch fish.

1151
01:17:59,030 --> 01:18:00,693
I'll let you off since you're so cute.

1152
01:18:01,830 --> 01:18:04,096
I'll open up the fish. Scalpel.

1153
01:18:06,530 --> 01:18:09,268
Ugh, such a cold-blooded,
tear-less woman.

1154
01:18:10,850 --> 01:18:12,071
That's good.

1155
01:18:12,790 --> 01:18:14,573
What else would you call it but fish?

1156
01:18:14,850 --> 01:18:15,808
Fish.

1157
01:18:16,350 --> 01:18:17,376
Fish.

1158
01:18:18,530 --> 01:18:21,280
You're a kid. Kid.

1159
01:18:21,860 --> 01:18:22,848
Fish.

1160
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:24,983
You're such a kid.

1161
01:18:25,250 --> 01:18:27,252
What kind of jerk taught
you such a thing?

1162
01:18:28,060 --> 01:18:29,588
A jerk named Yoo Si Jin.

1163
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:32,758
Joo Si Jin and...

1164
01:18:33,510 --> 01:18:35,327
I don't like his name.

1165
01:18:38,930 --> 01:18:39,832
Cue!

1166
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:46,138
It feels like an intro
to a very long report.

1167
01:18:49,470 --> 01:18:50,375
Let's go.

1168
01:18:52,980 --> 01:18:56,148
It's a wrap!

1169
01:18:57,990 --> 01:19:01,640
258 days filled with passion
as hot as the sun...

1170
01:19:01,754 --> 01:19:03,188
This is how it ended.

1171
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:07,126
It left a deep impression
on the viewers' hearts.
