1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,622
Can you save this patient?

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:06,990
What?

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,761
I won't know for sure
until I open him up,

4
00:00:10,994 --> 00:00:12,600
but somewhere in the biliary
tree, there is bleeding...

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:13,830
Enough with the complicated stuff.

6
00:00:14,164 --> 00:00:17,868
Just tell me whether or not you
can save him... as a doctor.

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,700
You bastard! What are
you doing right now?

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:23,707
Answer me.

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,577
I can save him.

10
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:36,953
Then save him.

11
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,203
We're moving the bed
to the operating room.

12
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:58,290
Get back! I'm telling
you for the last time.

13
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,710
From this moment forward, protecting
the medical team and the patient

14
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,213
is our first and foremost duty.

15
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,085
Team, line up in front of the guns.

16
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:19,096
From this moment on,
whoever is of threat,

17
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:21,631
I give you permission to shoot.

18
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:26,036
Look, Captain, you better know
exactly what you're doing.

19
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:30,107
You do your job. The doctor
will save our patient,

20
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,777
and I'll protect what I have to.

21
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,216
We're transporting him now.

22
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,360
The VIP is now in the operating room.

23
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,890
I am told that our team and Mubarat's guards
have their weapons drawn at each other.

24
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,590
Medically speaking, our medical
team's decision is the right one.

25
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,009
Making the right medical decision
is not what's important right now!

26
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,878
We're talking about President
Mubarat of the Arab League here!

27
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,020
What happens if something goes wrong?

28
00:02:44,114 --> 00:02:48,285
If something goes wrong, our government
will have problems with every Arab nation!

29
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,855
We will start the surgery. Scalpel.

30
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,999
You crazy bastards! Stop right now!

31
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,372
Yoo Si Jin! Seo Dae Young!

32
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,809
Why isn't anyone answering me!

33
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:28,250
Power of unity! Special forces are in full armor at
the drill ground. Taebaek Unit FPCon level 1...

34
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:32,362
Do I not have ears? I got
it, so get the car ready!

35
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,297
Power of unity.

36
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:41,280
Because of you bastards, we've
been issued FPCon level one.

37
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,073
We are about to go to war now.

38
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,544
Whoever can hear me, make sure
you tell Yoo Si Jin this.

39
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:52,249
Go get the doctors right now and stop the operation
immediately. Also, handover the VIP to the Arabs.

40
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:56,253
Or else I will shoot
everyone for disobedience!

41
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,150
If you start this then you won't be able
turn back. If you change your mind...

42
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,394
Over here, Sunbae.

43
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,131
This is a subcostal incision, right?

44
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,467
There wasn't a record of
any surgery on his chart.

45
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:16,306
That's why, except for what was confirmed, you
shouldn't trust anything with this operation.

46
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,742
That is why this operation is dangerous.

47
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:22,070
The patient, us, and even the
soldiers that are outside...

48
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,648
If we stop this because it's dangerous
then this patient will die.

49
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,851
And as doctors we really don't
have any choice in the matter.

50
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:37,961
We will cut the abdomen open now.

51
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,576
You know, for 1.6 billion Arabs,

52
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,913
you are pointing the knife
on the heart of peace.

53
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:00,050
The doctor is just
operating on a patient

54
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,686
who needs surgery.

55
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:09,090
I was doubting it earlier but it's true.
This patient had a GB surgery before.

56
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,762
The adhesion between the tissues is severe.
We'll start by removing this first

57
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:15,932
in order and with precision. Bovie.

58
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:25,120
His blood pressure is falling too
rapidly. He's losing too much blood.

59
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,576
Please pump more blood into him.

60
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:31,147
-His blood pressure is going down even further.
-What do we do?

61
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,783
If something happens to this
patient, are we all going to die?

62
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,252
I'm a father now...

63
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,924
If anything goes wrong,
you will pay for this.

64
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:46,963
Insyaallah.

65
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,667
God's Will be done.

66
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,007
This won't do.

67
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:03,000
We don't have time. Let's just take care
of the adhesion, stop the bleeding, and...

68
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,948
Nurse Jang, you need to do
the transfusion faster.

69
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:09,552
We can handle this amount of bleeding.

70
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,522
After removing the tissue adhesion,
we can take care of hemorrhage.

71
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:16,326
Just do as we had originally planned
in sequence with confidence.

72
00:06:16,693 --> 00:06:17,410
But...

73
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,497
Stop with your whining and bring 10
more packs of Red Blood Cells.

74
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,900
We will start again.

75
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,105
We will proceed with adhesion removal.

76
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:45,822
-What's the situation over there?
-They are still operating on him.

77
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,732
I think the Arab
doctor-in-charge has arrived.

78
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:18,588
Everything is okay now since we
were able to repair the aneurysm.

79
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,623
His blood pressure is stabilizing.

80
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,638
Good. We will calmly clean up our
surroundings and will do the angiorrhaphy.

81
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:55,558
Seems like all of the
surgical operation went well.

82
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,060
It'll leave a scar.

83
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,930
It could have been better
if I had the right chart.

84
00:08:01,197 --> 00:08:06,803
Well, the patient still needs to wake
up to call the surgery a success.

85
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:10,110
I'd still be worried if I were you.

86
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,680
If I just sat around and worried and did
nothing, you would have a dead body now.

87
00:08:14,811 --> 00:08:16,713
He could still die!

88
00:08:20,383 --> 00:08:21,818
Don't you think we know that?

89
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,925
Are you okay?

90
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,832
I will stay here so why don't
you go and get some rest.

91
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,166
I am fine.

92
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,069
I am just a little hungry.

93
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:46,576
Why don't you go with Nurse Ha and Nurse Choi and
get some food? We would be able to rotate later.

94
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,977
Yes, ma'am.

95
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,413
By the way...

96
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,883
What do we do if he doesn't wake up?

97
00:08:56,452 --> 00:09:01,291
There will be a case report
on Hepatic artery aneurysm,

98
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,162
and the world history will change...

99
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:10,133
Would there be any problem
during the recovery period?

100
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:15,610
Although the surgery went well,
post-surgery is where we need to...

101
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:19,342
You don't need to explain anything. We are just
left with the results of the surgery that's all.

102
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,780
We were able to avoid the worst kind
of friction like an armed clash,

103
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,250
but we need some kind of
justification for diplomatic means.

104
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:31,888
Don't you think we should take an anticipatory
measure regarding the ones that are accountable?

105
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,701
This is the Commander. Connect
me to the signal corps.

106
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,407
Sergeant First Class Seo, can you hear
me? This is the Commander speaking.

107
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,110
Unity in power. This is Sergeant
First Class Seo Dae Young.

108
00:09:55,144 --> 00:09:59,616
Release Captain Yoo Si Jin from his
position for disobeying orders,

109
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,718
and put him in detention.

110
00:10:09,258 --> 00:10:12,762
I know. As your superior, I
am proud of your actions.

111
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,464
You've worked hard,

112
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:17,266
but my order still stands.

113
00:10:18,067 --> 00:10:18,935
Carry out the change.

114
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,863
Sergeant Gong Cheol Ho.

115
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:55,038
Captain Yoo Si Jin, for
disobeying your order,

116
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,374
you're dismissed as Company Commander and
will be taken to temporary detention.

117
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:08,484
I'm not running off. I've been summoned.

118
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:19,262
Please take care of the
follow-up measures.

119
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:38,848
Is that Ahjussi really
keeping an eye on us?

120
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,518
I don't think he's standing there
hoping to get some cup noodles.

121
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,459
It hasn't been three minutes yet.

122
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:55,064
It's not that. I keep questioning myself
if I counted the gauze correctly.

123
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,835
You don't think it's inside the patient
and we just sewed it up, right?

124
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,005
What kind of joke is that?

125
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:06,320
Besides, our Nurse Ha is as sharp
as a knife when it comes to that.

126
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:09,378
Should I go back and count them again?
How many did we have originally?

127
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,980
What are you saying right now?

128
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,753
As per the orders,

129
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,990
you will be detained here in the
supply storage until further notice.

130
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,829
I wish it had been the
food storage area.

131
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,102
Power of unity.

132
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,306
Seo Dae Young, wait outside.

133
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:39,842
Power of unity.

134
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:53,422
You crazy bastard. The Captain is in
detainment and the squad is a mess.

135
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,859
-I apologize.
-Why did you do something that you'll be sorry for?

136
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:01,110
Do you know how many people might
lose their jobs because of you?

137
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,966
-I have nothing to say.
-Of course. You shouldn't have anything to say!

138
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:11,340
If only you stay out of trouble, you could get
promoted at every chance, getting every star.

139
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,376
You are the one that's
shooting yourself in the foot.

140
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:16,979
I don't regret it.

141
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:21,017
I am the one that made these decisions.

142
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,387
I will take responsibility
for everything, sir.

143
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:32,128
You better stand by what you just said.

144
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:38,734
Where is Captain Yoo?

145
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:41,260
He is on standby for detention.
Visitation is not allowed.

146
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,673
Please, just for five minutes.

147
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:52,715
Hey, Seo Dae Young, where is that
crazy doctor named Kang Mo Yeon?

148
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:55,451
Go get her and bring her here. I want
to see what her face looks like.

149
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,650
I will do that when the VIP wakes up...

150
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:01,490
I'm... Kang Mo Yeon.

151
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,931
What about the VIP? Not yet?

152
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,750
We are just waiting right now.

153
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,936
Anybody can say that. What if he
doesn't wake up after we wait?

154
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,409
The diagnosis and treatment were all
based on medically rational decisions.

155
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,112
You seem to be so confident.

156
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:26,415
You don't mind being canned by the hospital since
you would be able to open up your own, right?

157
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:28,184
You are such a well-to-do doctor after all.

158
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:32,255
You completely ruined Yoo Si Jin's life.

159
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,824
His current situation is...

160
00:14:34,824 --> 00:14:38,194
more than a decade's worth of service and
future success are now all went down the drain.

161
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:42,450
If the VIP doesn't wake up, then the rest of
his life will be going down the drain, too.

162
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,134
It's all because of your so-called
"rational" decision, doctor.

163
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,910
Let's still try to
make sure he wakes up.

164
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:58,281
By doing that, both of our careers
will go on without a problem.

165
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,052
I am asking you a favor here.

166
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:13,896
Power of unity.

167
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,980
The VIP situation will be reported every hour...

168
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,838
That's enough.

169
00:15:23,406 --> 00:15:25,975
I don't want to see your face either so pack up
your things and go to the airport now.

170
00:15:26,242 --> 00:15:27,740
There is no change in your transfer order.

171
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:31,070
That's true, sir. But, when the Company Commander
is unavailable, as second-in-command, I...

172
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,816
You should have been nitpicky like
this earlier and stopped him.

173
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,719
Do you also want to go through disciplinary
action for disobeying my commands?

174
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,023
Staff Sergeant Choi, you will be the
temporary commander from now on.

175
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,220
Seo Dae Young, you will obey my commands
and go back. Do you understand me?

176
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,161
Yes, I understand.

177
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:51,934
You two listen to me carefully.

178
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,970
Even if you do get investigated
upon your return to Korea,

179
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:57,773
Yoo Si Jin will be responsible for this incident,
he would have to carry the weight all by himself.

180
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,575
Keep that in mind.

181
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,112
Go.

182
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,500
Are you leaving now?

183
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,235
I will be leaving at 21:00.

184
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,673
Have you thought about
not leaving at all?

185
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,409
Why don't you try resisting
a little this time?

186
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:38,948
I am not escaping by my own
will, but it's a command.

187
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,687
I am sorry that I have to leave
before you at a time like this.

188
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,356
I will report for the
transfer right now.

189
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:53,996
I'm dismissed from my post, I'm no longer your
supervisor. Why would you want to report to me?

190
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:02,405
The command that I got from my direct
supervisor today was all correct.

191
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:09,578
Also, all the commands I received from my
direct supervisor today were very honorable.

192
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,617
I will see you back home,
Company Commander, sir.

193
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:22,391
I'll buy you soju...
for 3 days straight.

194
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:39,730
I report to your sir. As of May 24, 2015,
I, Sergeant First Class Seo Dae Young,

195
00:17:39,842 --> 00:17:42,178
have been ordered to transfer
to the Special Warfare Command.

196
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:45,314
End of report. Power of unity.

197
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,616
Power of unity.

198
00:17:58,928 --> 00:18:01,464
At 20:50. You have exactly 10 minutes.

199
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:14,043
Excuse me there. This is Kang Mo Yeon.

200
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:19,782
Let's get going.

201
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,617
Yes, sir. We will get going right now.

202
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,840
I am so glad to see you.

203
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,944
Are you here to visit me?

204
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,720
I am sorry.

205
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:00,823
You didn't do anything to owe
an apology, Doctor Kang.

206
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:07,596
The patient is not able
to wake up just yet.

207
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:15,137
Don't you think you have too many
men that you are worrying about?

208
00:19:16,438 --> 00:19:22,411
Don't be so such an easy woman. And starting from
now on, you should only worry about me, Dr. Kang.

209
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:32,087
When I saw you earlier, I realized
what you said before was true.

210
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,491
What?

211
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,228
That you are sexy in the operating room.

212
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,896
But why did you do it?

213
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:47,536
You had the option to make a decision
against that situation earlier.

214
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,606
It didn't have to be
like that, you know.

215
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:51,907
I told you already.

216
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:57,012
That beautiful ladies, the elderly and
children should be protected. That's my rule.

217
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,282
Beauties and the elderly.

218
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:05,187
They were both right in front of me but I
wasn't able to protect either properly.

219
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,295
You were very brave today.

220
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:17,433
Do you know that?

221
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:27,876
Are you crying right now?

222
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:38,240
Is it okay in there?
Do you need anything?

223
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,122
I first need C-4 or RDX.

224
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,860
What is that?

225
00:20:43,025 --> 00:20:44,059
It's a bomb.

226
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:49,231
I was okay until now, but I suddenly
want to break the door and get out.

227
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,166
Because of somebody.

228
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:00,042
How can you joke at this moment?

229
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:06,615
I know I shouldn't, but I
keep doing the hard things.

230
00:21:07,716 --> 00:21:08,550
Me.

231
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,626
I think time's up.

232
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:28,504
Here. Thought you might need it.

233
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:37,012
I will get going now.

234
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:38,747
Thank you.

235
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:43,485
It is just what I needed.

236
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:23,352
This man is not sick anymore.

237
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,889
What are you doing? Step away!

238
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,191
Hey! He's just a kid!

239
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:30,959
What? What's wrong?

240
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:37,599
President, can you see me?

241
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,538
Please follow my fingers.

242
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,447
He woke up! He woke up!

243
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:57,553
We're alive. I thought my
life would have ended here.

244
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:00,660
The patient lives to save the doctor.

245
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:02,170
It's really a relief.

246
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:05,300
My family may be well off, but it didn't look
like it was something that can be taken care of.

247
00:24:05,394 --> 00:24:08,063
Ah, your family isn't that well off?

248
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:12,468
This was the second time in my medical career
where I was that scared in the operating room.

249
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:13,969
When was your first?

250
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:18,474
When I was operating on her mother. I was
so nervous something would go wrong.

251
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:23,312
They said to gather. The
patient is being transferred.

252
00:24:25,781 --> 00:24:28,217
Attention! Salute!

253
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:49,671
Rest.

254
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:56,879
VIP is currently on the way to
the city with his practitioner.

255
00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:01,183
I heard that the surgery was a sucess
and the atmosphere here is not so bad.

256
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,151
Situation is over.

257
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:04,820
That's a relief.

258
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,822
Yes, don't worry.

259
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,524
Please arrive safely.

260
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:13,295
There is a whining kid next to me
so I will turn on the speakerphone.

261
00:25:14,997 --> 00:25:17,165
This is Communications and Information
Services Private Kim Ki Bum.

262
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,868
How can you do this to me?

263
00:25:20,836 --> 00:25:22,804
How can you just leave like this?

264
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:27,576
Of course, I just leave. I
left the dictionary with you.

265
00:25:27,976 --> 00:25:30,012
Continue your preparation
for the GED exam.

266
00:25:30,312 --> 00:25:33,549
Staff Sergeant Choi, watch
him to make sure he studies.

267
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,484
Yes, I will make sure he does.

268
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:37,419
Power of unity.

269
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:40,522
Okay. Work hard. I'm hanging up.

270
00:26:25,367 --> 00:26:27,636
You are exactly the
person I was looking for.

271
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,505
But what do I do if he is present here?

272
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:33,942
Where are you going?

273
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:37,179
Are you running away again?

274
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:40,949
I am asking if you are
running away again.

275
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:49,591
Sergeant First Class Seo Dae Young.
I was ordered...

276
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,099
to return to our home country.

277
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:03,138
Tell me it is a feigned retreat.

278
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:06,875
Tell me to wait for you.

279
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:13,048
Tell me that you will
return at all cost.

280
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:25,360
There are lots of mosquitoes. Please make
sure to wear your uniform even if it's warm.

281
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:51,687
What is this?

282
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:55,657
What do you want me to do?

283
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:58,593
Please take care of yourself
at your deployment area.

284
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,069
Power of unity.

285
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:15,711
Why hug me? Why touch me?

286
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:18,747
If you touched me, be
responsible for it!

287
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,783
You said you can't be happy
with lingering feelings.

288
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,052
You give considerations for
other women so easily.

289
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:27,689
Why don't you at least
do that for me then?

290
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:35,831
Did you love that woman a lot?

291
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,899
Why are you curious about that?

292
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:41,670
There are certain levels
and intensity to revenges.

293
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:45,407
I made a promise to her
that I will make her happy.

294
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:51,246
I don't think she will be happy
if you mess up her wedding.

295
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:54,416
People can't be happy if they
have lingering feelings.

296
00:28:56,870 --> 00:29:02,758
You are not going for a revenge but
to give considerations for her?

297
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:15,740
How did you...

298
00:29:15,871 --> 00:29:20,220
I was wondering who you were getting
married to. I saw him on the way here.

299
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:21,660
You haven't greeted him
by any chance, did you?

300
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:22,760
I can, on the way out.

301
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,379
Oppa, that...

302
00:29:27,716 --> 00:29:31,119
Nice to meet you. Congratulations
on your wedding.

303
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,350
Who is she?

304
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,756
Thought I might need to say hello.

305
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,325
Thank you for letting this man go.

306
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:39,694
I am Staff Sergeant Seo's girlfriend.

307
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:45,300
It would be awkward to call each other ex and
current girlfriend, so call me Doctor Yoon.

308
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,802
I am a doctor.

309
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:49,010
Is she really your girlfriend?

310
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,539
I have nothing else to
say, other than that.

311
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:59,281
I don't think I will be thinking
about you, thanks to this person.

312
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:05,353
So live well without being anxious
since you went anyway.

313
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,391
I sincerely congratulate
you on your wedding.

314
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,802
Do you regret it?

315
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,039
No, it feels good.

316
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,744
I feel regretful.

317
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:31,112
What do you mean?

318
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,714
I don't know.

319
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:35,550
Well, I feel a little strange.

320
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:39,554
Since I did my part,

321
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:42,730
don't forget to tell Captain
Yoo Si Jin that we're dating.

322
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,925
Don't worry.

323
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,750
I said, "I wouldn't marry Yoo Si Jin."

324
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,171
When did I ever say that I was
never going to get married?

325
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,506
What the heck did you say?

326
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:04,246
What came out of my mouth was, "I'm dating First
Lieutenant Yoon Myung Joo." It was only that.

327
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:10,051
But then why are there rumors around the
entire base that we slept together?

328
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,121
Because the soldiers'
imagination is amazing?

329
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:18,627
Staff Sergeant Seo, do
you find this funny?

330
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:21,296
Well, I don't find it not funny.

331
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:25,901
Is this about someone else?

332
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:28,880
How do guys think that dating and
sleeping together are the same thing?

333
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:31,600
That's what men do.
Don't worry about it.

334
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:35,176
If you worry, it's sleep... losing.

335
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,760
-It's sleeping?
-It's my mistake.

336
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:40,115
Don't try to be funny.

337
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,784
Are men's minds only filled
with thoughts about sex?

338
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:45,954
Because of this I'll always be sleep...

339
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,890
It'll be a losing fight.

340
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:55,664
I may not know how to win, but I
know how to make the score even.

341
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:57,198
What is that?

342
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:59,334
We can just make the rumors into truths.

343
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:02,437
Make the rumors true...

344
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:06,090
What do you see me as?

345
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,008
Are you okay?

346
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:10,090
-I didn't know you were like this!
-I'm sorry.

347
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,313
How can you?

348
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,118
First Lieutenant Yoon Myung Joo has been reported
to have arrived at the Taebaek Base in Urk.

349
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:21,189
And Sergeant First Class Seo Dae Young has been
reported to have left the Urk airport at 13:00.

350
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,293
It's a call from the Blue House.

351
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:26,661
Connect me.

352
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,935
-This is the Commander.
-This is Lee Hyun Soo.

353
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:39,941
Just a moment ago, the Arab League made an
unofficial request  the surgery on the VIP.

354
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:45,380
To put it simply, they insist that "there
was no surgery in the first place."

355
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,949
Therefore, "no visit was
ever made to Medi Cube."

356
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,420
"We don't want any records to remain on
this matter..." is what they're saying.

357
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:57,625
Our government has promised full
cooperation on this matter.

358
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,863
With regarding Captain Yoo Si Jin, whether you
give him disciplinary action or commend him,

359
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:05,166
we will respect the Army's decision.

360
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,104
We will take the necessary measures.

361
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:14,642
Yoo Si Jin is still in detention, right?

362
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:15,910
Yes, that's right.

363
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:20,580
Expunge all records regarding the
surgery, and release Yoo Si Jin.

364
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:22,450
Move forward with the
disciplinary hearing.

365
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:25,286
A disciplinary hearing
instead of commending him?

366
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:29,124
Connect me to the Major
General on the Taebaek Base.

367
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,566
There are this many beans in Urk?

368
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:43,238
None of you guys stopped this?

369
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:46,130
For our Company Commander who spent
1 night and 2 days in detention

370
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:50,445
and has been safely released from prison, I
have prepared a cube of tofu in the center,

371
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:55,316
surrounded by Tofu Stew on the right and Tofu
Kimchi on the left. There is even a star here.

372
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,618
"Released from prison?"

373
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,720
Is that not it?

374
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,123
Then... "chool-mol"?

375
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:08,763
"Flash appearance?" "Chool-dong"
you punk. The Captain has been deployed.

376
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:11,950
What's wrong with him?

377
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:13,735
I'll teach him more.

378
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:17,405
First, take this.

379
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:20,341
You two are saved by
Staff Sergeant Choi.

380
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,715
-Everybody attention!
-Attention!

381
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:30,185
The Company Commander
will say one thing.

382
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,120
We had an emergency...

383
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,657
and things were out of place not having the second
in line commander, but you guys worked hard.

384
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:41,496
Although today's party is filled with tofu, I'll
treat everyone to Samgyeopsal this weekend,

385
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,800
so everyone enjoy your meal. That's all.

386
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:47,802
Thank you for the food!

387
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,345
Why are you just leaving?

388
00:34:58,370 --> 00:34:59,747
Aren't you here to see me?

389
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:02,851
Later. Enjoy your meal.

390
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:07,222
No. Let's meet now.

391
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:26,674
I thought you were just posing
as a doctor, but I guess not.

392
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:29,344
-You really saved him.
-You said to save him.

393
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,346
Gosh, you listened well to that.

394
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:36,117
I think you said to leave the
medical issues to the medical team.

395
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:38,360
It seems like you hold grudges.

396
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:40,388
You became carefree overnight.

397
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:50,165
You said to just say "thank
you' if you're thankful.

398
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:55,403
Thank you for trusting me.

399
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,209
It was really scary, right?

400
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:05,446
Honestly, yeah a little.

401
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,550
You were scared too, right?

402
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:11,753
It's a situation that I'm quite used to.

403
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,095
And it kept bothering me but
I didn't have a chance.

404
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:25,967
When I said that there needed to be doctors
who appear on TV, I didn't mean it.

405
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,204
I hope you won't think too much of it.

406
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:32,040
Well, it's not wrong.

407
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:36,670
It's wrong for a doctor who said she will still
save a patient, even with a gun to her head.

408
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,714
Well, if you insist, I guess.

409
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:45,853
But do you think he'd really shoot me?

410
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,659
I don't want to hear it.

411
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,629
Don't tell me. Don't tell me.

412
00:36:56,231 --> 00:36:57,298
Company Commander!

413
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,485
Hello! Welcome, Doctor
Kang and Captain Yoo.

414
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:23,750
Because of your quick judgements,
I heard my life was saved.

415
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,095
Because of that, God has
given me more time to work.

416
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:29,464
I thank you in God's name.

417
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:34,002
You have chronic heart disease,
so stress is really dangerous.

418
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:38,473
For the time being, you need to
try ignoring stressful problems.

419
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:46,581
Of course, doctors start nagging
regardless of nationality.

420
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:50,818
War is easy and peace is hard.

421
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:54,222
Perhaps that is why
dictators live a long life.

422
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:59,640
It seems like I can connect more
with soldiers than with doctors.

423
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:03,364
It seems like I can connect more
with soldiers than with doctors.

424
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:09,580
I will respect the
doctor's recommendations.

425
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:12,440
There must be a reason
from God for all of this.

426
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:16,678
It was an honor to treat
such an astounding person.

427
00:38:17,078 --> 00:38:21,282
I need to give you my gratitude.
This is a small gift of gratitude.

428
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:32,060
It's not just any business card.

429
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,296
This card will save you
in about any situation,

430
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,532
anywhere there are Arabs.

431
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:45,606
But, since you're giving me
one, can you give me 2 instead?

432
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:49,960
Since there are two people and
this one can get wet and ruined.

433
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:53,214
Since there are two people, and
this one can get wet and ruined.

434
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,393
I guess this card is like a "Free Pass."

435
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,862
Give me one. I'll confirm it.

436
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:13,601
I will drive.

437
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:17,271
I will take the car for the day.

438
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:20,700
How could you use that card
for a mere rental car?

439
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:22,844
It's not like you used it to
attain the rental company itself!

440
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,212
Aren't you crazy?

441
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,249
I didn't know you were a
man without thoughts.

442
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,250
Don't you have ambition?
Like there's stuff like oil!

443
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,255
In their neighborhood, oil can be
rigged from anyone's backyard!

444
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,057
If we just sold that oil...

445
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:39,093
Ah, we were his lifesaver.

446
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:42,263
That man was ready in his
heart to give anything!

447
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:46,370
Do you feel that wronged?
I think I used it well.

448
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,935
What do you mean you used it well?

449
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,107
I have two and a half hours
left until returning to base,

450
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:58,179
and if I step on the pedal, we
can get there in 30 minutes.

451
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:01,749
So for the next 2 hours,
I'll be on a date with you.

452
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:07,188
Wow. You're crazy. You used
that card all for a date.

453
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:11,410
And who said I'd date with you?

454
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,927
I wasn't asking for opinions.

455
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,596
Let's have some tea.

456
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,532
You should ask for some opinions.

457
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:29,310
Oh, what a waste. What a waste.

458
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:33,548
This is mine so don't
think about touching it.

459
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:39,420
What should I use this for?
Should I start my clinic in Arab?

460
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,357
I should've taken a photo with him!

461
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:46,394
I would've hit the jackpot if I hung that
picture on the wall at my Clinic, right?

462
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:51,599
Why did you become a doctor, Dr. Kang?

463
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:55,102
Because I was good at the
sciences, particularly math.

464
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:57,171
You're good at persuading.

465
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:00,308
I thought a doctor will
make a lot of money.

466
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,479
I believe that it's better to live a life
with money than to be chased around by money.

467
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:08,483
Regardless of what others say, my specialty
is gaining as much effort as I put into work.

468
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:12,053
I think that setting up a hospital
in Kangnam is good business.

469
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,892
I can't let myself down.

470
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:22,763
Then why do you keep on
pretending you are a bad person?

471
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,836
It fits me to say that I
became a doctor to earn money.

472
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,473
There were many things
when you weren't there.

473
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:35,276
I've changed during that time.

474
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:40,830
I think you didn't change
at all, Captain Yoo.

475
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,150
I got more handsome, but I
guess it's not noticeable.

476
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:46,487
You joked like before.

477
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:50,391
The way you laugh was pretty.

478
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:01,102
Wait a minute.

479
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,773
Yeah, it is me.

480
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:07,975
UN?

481
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,614
Who?

482
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:25,960
-I am sorry.
-Again?

483
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:29,880
-You have to go again?
-Yes. For the car, Teacher Kang...

484
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:32,033
I guess the ending of our
date didn't change at all.

485
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,302
Whether it is in Korea or here.

486
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:36,704
Where are you going?

487
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:38,773
You can't tell me
because of regulations?

488
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:42,143
Is that a place that you
can't go together with me?

489
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:44,879
It isn't like you can't
go to that place.

490
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:48,449
There's nothing for me to
gain by taking you there.

491
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:51,840
Why do you always look for
a way to gain something?

492
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:53,421
The work I do,

493
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:56,958
is disadvantageous for our relationship.

494
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:03,297
Even then, what if I want
to go together with you?

495
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:45,439
Yeah, that's good.

496
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:49,243
Good luck guys. Get back to work.

497
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:51,646
Hey captain. Captain.

498
00:43:53,914 --> 00:43:55,010
-What is that?
-Mask.

499
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,317
Okay. Okay.

500
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:01,322
Kimchi. One... Two... Three.

501
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:03,491
Kimchi.

502
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:29,450
Let's go.

503
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,585
Better get to work.

504
00:45:06,310 --> 00:45:09,323
It was a hard day. Rest.

505
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:12,059
Were you comforting people?

506
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:16,697
At that... memorial service.

507
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:18,132
You waited for a long time.

508
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,768
You must have been curious
about me in the car.

509
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:26,207
He was a fellow soldier
who fought beside me.

510
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,710
-But why?
-To keep peace.

511
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:35,660
So about that... so you... Captain Yoo..

512
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:40,254
So let's not talk about that.

513
00:45:43,370 --> 00:45:46,894
Look. I told you it was
disadvantageous if we come together.

514
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:50,831
Rest deeply.

515
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:54,128
Excuse me.

516
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:04,490
I don't see Captain Yoo.
Where did he go?

517
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,941
He's at the main base. Today
is his disciplinary hearing.

518
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:08,776
Disciplinary action? What
disciplinary action?

519
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,046
Wasn't that work finished well?

520
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:13,681
It looks like it wasn't.

521
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:16,650
Commands, in a soldier's life, are gold.

522
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:20,721
How does the doctor, who demanded to do the surgery
that everybody told her not to do, not know this?

523
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:27,120
URK TAEBAEK UNIT MILITARY HEAQUARTERS.

524
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:32,399
I'm saying this again. We can't put an exact
punishment for the disobeying of our commands.

525
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:37,972
But. We advise you to
never disobey us again.

526
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:42,376
In conclusion about the
situation on May 18,

527
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:47,414
For proper obedience of orders, we
give you 3 months of punishment.

528
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:50,384
-Do you have any objections?
-No, sir.

529
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:55,055
Also, you are to stay here when the
other soldiers go back to Korea.

530
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:58,058
-Again, do you have any objections.
-No, sir.

531
00:47:58,450 --> 00:47:59,927
Good. That's it.

532
00:48:00,828 --> 00:48:01,428
Power of unity.

533
00:48:14,608 --> 00:48:17,380
How did you get caught in
such a flimsy booby trap?

534
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:18,879
You're so out of line.

535
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:23,117
-When did you come?
-I came yesterday.

536
00:48:23,870 --> 00:48:25,286
You did suffer a bit.

537
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:27,521
Don't respect me too much.

538
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:34,540
Hey, you could start a business in Kangnam. Why
did you come to the dark hold called the army?

539
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:38,098
This man... I have a goal too!

540
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:40,701
I am going to put stars on my shoulders.

541
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:45,390
Senior, seeing how you made a mistake,
maybe I will be able to get it before you.

542
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,841
Oh, congratulations.

543
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:54,214
Seeing that you aren't looking for Sergeant Seo as
you got here, you probably know that he left.

544
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:58,185
I met him at the airport.

545
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:01,655
No wonder. Is the airport okay?

546
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:05,125
Whose side are you on, Senior?

547
00:49:05,559 --> 00:49:07,828
Well, I'm always on my country's side.

548
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:12,800
Thank you.

549
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:19,540
Oh she is someone I have seen
so many times somewhere.

550
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:21,175
Me too. Leave.

551
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:26,146
This situation rose because of
me so why can't you change it?

552
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:29,760
Why does Captain Yoo Si Jin have to take all
the responsibility when he has no fault?

553
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:33,554
Why isn't he at fault? Soldiers are meant to
follow all orders, whether they like it or not!

554
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:39,850
You're a doctor, so you saved a life.
That's what a doctor does.

555
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:42,296
Army problems are different
than medical problems.

556
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:45,366
I was there so I will
serve as a witness.

557
00:49:45,610 --> 00:49:48,602
I'll take responsibility
for the things I need to.

558
00:49:50,037 --> 00:49:54,842
Look doctor. This is not a court case.
Do you not know punishment?

559
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:59,380
Yoo Si Jin has been punished for.

560
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:01,782
Can you take responsibility
for these things?

561
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:07,187
Power of unity.

562
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:11,325
I am sorry. Please come out.

563
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:27,975
Hello. What are you doing now?

564
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:32,479
Why did you do such useless stuff?

565
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:33,981
Useless stuff?

566
00:50:34,915 --> 00:50:36,200
Because of me, the life of a person...

567
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:37,651
It isn't because of you.

568
00:50:39,253 --> 00:50:41,388
Do you think I did that to save a girl?

569
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:50,264
Do you remember the bullet wound on
my body when we first met in Korea?

570
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:56,737
The first day I was assigned a Special
Forces Sergeant, this Sunbae told me this.

571
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,340
"A soldier lives with wearing
shroud at all times."

572
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:04,845
"As you die at the unknown
battlefront for your country,

573
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:10,084
the place you lay down becomes your grave,
and your uniform becomes your shroud."

574
00:51:11,552 --> 00:51:13,720
"You must wear the uniform with
that kind of determination."

575
00:51:15,022 --> 00:51:16,757
"If you wore the uniform with
that kind of determination,

576
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:19,760
be honorable at every moment.
There is no reason not to be."

577
00:51:25,699 --> 00:51:27,534
I owe my life to that sunbae.

578
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:33,540
That's when I got that gunshot wound.

579
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,411
I'm saying that big or small,
all the decisions I make

580
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:41,515
includes my comrades' honor,
glory and sense of duty.

581
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:43,860
It applies to that situation as well.

582
00:51:43,984 --> 00:51:46,220
I made a decision upon
consideration of all those things,

583
00:51:46,587 --> 00:51:48,388
and I don't regret on my decisions.

584
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:50,691
But that does not mean...

585
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:55,028
the fact that I broke the
military law can be neglected.

586
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,802
The military will take care
of the military problems.

587
00:52:02,070 --> 00:52:07,941
So you should leave it
alone please, Dr. Kang.

588
00:52:11,490 --> 00:52:16,950
My worries must've
barged in your business.

589
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:21,155
I am really sorry.

590
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:09,536
Power of unity. Where are you?

591
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:11,638
Have you arrived safely?

592
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,441
I'm on top of the road.

593
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:15,709
Crossroads of choices?

594
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:18,412
Road. Road.

595
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:20,781
I am on top of the road
that leads to the barracks.

596
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,083
Are you saying that you're
on the way to barracks?

597
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:27,854
No. Just a road. Long Road.
I am talking about "Road".

598
00:53:28,370 --> 00:53:30,490
Oh, let it be.

599
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:32,826
Did you see Myeong Joo?

600
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:34,361
Is that important now?

601
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:38,150
I couldn't even get a promotion.
And I got a pay cut.

602
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,400
Of course you deserve your pay cut.

603
00:53:40,990 --> 00:53:43,437
How much money are you going
to use because of a girl?

604
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:45,539
It isn't because of a girl.

605
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,840
As a soldier who makes the protection of his home
country's citizen as the first priority, I...

606
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:50,810
Because that citizen was pretty.

607
00:53:50,944 --> 00:53:52,546
This man, seriously.

608
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:55,415
Did you call me in order to do this?

609
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:58,986
I didn't call you in order to do this.
I am doing this since I called you.

610
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,222
Did you see Myeong Joo?

611
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:06,493
Sergeant Seo, do you even know how
much the international call costs?

612
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:11,765
How much money are you going
to use because of a girl?

613
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:33,253
Power of unity.

614
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,690
-Okay. You've worked hard.
-Yes.

615
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:54,574
Put your hand inside the cupboard.

616
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,344
A pay cut along with a failure
to secure a promotion,

617
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:01,248
I thought you might want some
alcohol on the day like today.

618
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:15,395
What is the matter?

619
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:18,598
To drink some water.

620
00:55:19,499 --> 00:55:21,868
Then why are you just leaving?
You should drink and leave.

621
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:25,640
Because I thought you
wanted to be alone.

622
00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:28,508
No. I want to be together with you.

623
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:30,644
I said that multiple times.

624
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:33,980
Don't go and come. This way.

625
00:55:46,326 --> 00:55:48,795
How about wine instead of water?

626
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:11,618
Expeditionary soliders are
not allowed to drink.

627
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:14,060
Didn't you bring it out
in order to drink?

628
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:19,493
I was going to just a while ago, but I
am doomed because now there's a witness.

629
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:31,171
I'm sorry for acting up before.

630
00:56:31,838 --> 00:56:35,542
I was going to apologize.
Let's just say we both did.

631
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:36,843
You didn't though.

632
00:56:42,149 --> 00:56:43,750
Why are you scared again?

633
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:47,430
Did I go too far again? What
did you ride to get here?

634
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,522
I ran here.

635
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:52,092
It's only possible that I was able to
arrive at this time because it was me.

636
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:56,863
I saw you earlier that you
got off from the car.

637
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:00,267
I guess you saw...

638
00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:04,971
-Then why did you laugh?
-Because I wanted to hear a joke.

639
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:10,977
The uniform suits you well.

640
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:14,381
Although it's not something
to say to a person

641
00:57:14,881 --> 00:57:17,584
who got punishment and returned
with clothes on that suits well.

642
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:22,689
How do you know if this
is the dress uniform?

643
00:57:23,023 --> 00:57:24,391
Why wouldn't I know?

644
00:57:24,891 --> 00:57:27,060
Women do have fantasies
about dress uniforms.

645
00:57:28,530 --> 00:57:30,497
It is the reason why I became a soldier.

646
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:39,105
Is it good?

647
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:43,109
A bit. Do you like alcohol?

648
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:51,017
I want to watch a movie and
have a drink with you.

649
00:57:51,410 --> 00:57:53,854
I could have been a perfect date.

650
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:57,023
Did you watch the movie?

651
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:58,225
No.

652
00:57:58,525 --> 00:58:01,228
Why didn't you watch it?

653
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:06,399
Because it was a movie that I was
going to watch with someone.

654
00:58:08,201 --> 00:58:09,769
And I thought about it.

655
00:58:10,337 --> 00:58:12,405
When I watch a movie
with a guy next time,

656
00:58:13,073 --> 00:58:15,008
I should avoid a fun movie.

657
00:58:16,042 --> 00:58:19,746
Everyday, there were news articles about that
movie till it broke record of ten million viewers.

658
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:27,687
But that movie... made me think about you
because it was about Yoo Si Jin for me.

659
00:58:36,696 --> 00:58:39,199
I guess you really want to drink it.

660
00:58:41,801 --> 00:58:43,537
It isn't like there
are no other methods.

661
00:59:16,570 --> 00:59:20,206
Do you know exactly what
Captain Yoo Si Jin's job is?

662
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:22,790
I went against God's will for no reason.

663
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,960
There must've been a
reason I was slowly dying.

664
00:59:24,970 --> 00:59:26,913
Please hurry up! It's breaking.

665
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,616
Please save me. Please save me.

666
00:59:30,183 --> 00:59:32,670
Please wait just a moment. I
will go there. I will find you.

667
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:34,054
Who is the farewell party for?

668
00:59:34,254 --> 00:59:35,855
It is a farewell party for Captain.

669
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:38,391
Captain Yoo?
