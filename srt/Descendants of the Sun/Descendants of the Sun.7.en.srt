1
00:00:37,482 --> 00:00:38,942
I was hoping you weren't hurt.

2
00:00:44,932 --> 00:00:46,286
I've been regretting...

3
00:00:48,062 --> 00:00:49,971
...not saying goodbye to you
before I left on that day.

4
00:00:52,194 --> 00:00:53,481
I can't be by your side,

5
00:00:55,002 --> 00:00:55,954
So please...

6
00:00:59,057 --> 00:01:00,165
...be careful.

7
00:01:00,822 --> 00:01:01,917
You too, Captain.

8
00:01:43,161 --> 00:01:45,001
"Episode 7"

9
00:01:47,472 --> 00:01:49,046
This is the Taebaek Corps rescue team.

10
00:01:49,854 --> 00:01:51,552
Is anyone in there?

11
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:54,175
If there is, knock three times!

12
00:02:06,074 --> 00:02:07,734
It looks like my judgment was wrong.

13
00:02:09,634 --> 00:02:10,478
No.

14
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:14,098
If most of the afternoon
shift staff members,

15
00:02:14,294 --> 00:02:16,015
escaped using the east stairway,

16
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,528
then this is the right
place to start searching.

17
00:02:18,934 --> 00:02:20,693
We've finished cutting off the gas pipe.

18
00:02:21,359 --> 00:02:22,637
How is the situation over there?

19
00:02:22,722 --> 00:02:23,590
Well...

20
00:02:24,246 --> 00:02:26,835
Over there is a hundred
times better than here.

21
00:02:27,091 --> 00:02:28,859
The building there is practically intact.

22
00:02:29,317 --> 00:02:31,864
The rubble blocking the entry
aren't even half of what's here.

23
00:02:32,211 --> 00:02:34,535
-Let's start with that side.
-No, we can't.

24
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,179
There are still loose rocks falling.

25
00:02:36,264 --> 00:02:37,610
What loose rocks?

26
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,498
It's only a few pebbles.

27
00:02:40,648 --> 00:02:43,607
If that scares you so much, how are you
going to manage the rescue operations?

28
00:02:44,124 --> 00:02:45,515
You're frustrating, seriously.

29
00:02:45,884 --> 00:02:49,256
After an earthquake, a building that
hasn't collapsed is much more dangerous.

30
00:02:49,341 --> 00:02:51,160
The outside may look fine,

31
00:02:51,245 --> 00:02:54,742
but the inside is unstable
due to the shock from the earthquake.

32
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,543
Even the slightest movement
from our equipment,

33
00:03:04,628 --> 00:03:06,938
could cause a bigger secondary damage.

34
00:03:07,915 --> 00:03:08,771
I can hear it!

35
00:03:09,443 --> 00:03:13,292
It's faint but I can definitely
hear the signal of a survivor.

36
00:03:20,495 --> 00:03:23,294
Prepare an endoscope and secure
the inside view as much as you can.

37
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:24,218
Yes, I got it.

38
00:03:33,573 --> 00:03:34,660
Hey.

39
00:03:34,991 --> 00:03:38,095
What use is a young man
like you with no strength?

40
00:03:38,514 --> 00:03:40,560
Hit it louder.

41
00:03:41,368 --> 00:03:42,703
It hurts...

42
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:45,789
Hurry, hurry.

43
00:03:46,047 --> 00:03:47,370
Safety first.

44
00:03:48,031 --> 00:03:49,604
Safety first.

45
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:52,215
Yes, you're right. Safety comes first.

46
00:03:52,513 --> 00:03:54,893
I'm really sorry.

47
00:03:55,153 --> 00:03:57,661
We built it saying that it'd be strong,

48
00:03:57,947 --> 00:04:01,176
but who would have known
an earthquake is going to happen?

49
00:04:02,227 --> 00:04:04,788
Anyway, hold on a little longer.

50
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,830
They're looking for us outside...

51
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:09,890
-Can you hear something?
-No, wait...

52
00:04:10,031 --> 00:04:11,317
Did you hear that?

53
00:04:12,725 --> 00:04:13,682
Who is it?

54
00:04:14,294 --> 00:04:15,067
Who is it?!

55
00:04:15,152 --> 00:04:16,275
Is that a rescue team?

56
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:17,773
Isn't that Manager Go's voice?

57
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:19,105
Yes? It's right!

58
00:04:19,824 --> 00:04:21,005
-Yes, you're right.
-Mr. Park.

59
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:22,787
-Manager Go?
-Where are you?

60
00:04:22,894 --> 00:04:25,246
Manager, I think we're above you!

61
00:04:25,524 --> 00:04:27,181
Hold on just a little longer.

62
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:29,840
The rescue team is on their way.

63
00:04:30,197 --> 00:04:33,402
Yes, yes, over here. We're over here!

64
00:04:33,824 --> 00:04:35,140
Please hurry!

65
00:04:35,803 --> 00:04:37,435
There are a lot of injured people!

66
00:04:38,094 --> 00:04:39,003
Hurry!

67
00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:41,814
Removing the pile of concrete,

68
00:04:41,899 --> 00:04:44,339
which is blocking the entry,
is most crucial.

69
00:04:44,424 --> 00:04:46,329
A pulley won't be able to bear the weight.

70
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:47,995
Then we have to drill a hole.

71
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,787
Say something that makes sense!

72
00:04:50,203 --> 00:04:53,427
This is reinforced concrete
made for specialized building.

73
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,124
It will take us more than three days
to drill through concrete that thick.

74
00:04:56,247 --> 00:04:57,414
We need to find an alternative.

75
00:04:57,542 --> 00:05:00,279
Why are you trying to find difficult ways
to do it when there's an easy way?

76
00:05:00,525 --> 00:05:02,185
I said let's use machinery!

77
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,010
How many times do I have to tell you that
entering that way with heavy equipment,

78
00:05:05,094 --> 00:05:07,180
is dangerous for everyone inside
because of the weak structure?

79
00:05:07,983 --> 00:05:09,516
Then, look here.

80
00:05:09,778 --> 00:05:12,561
Here, here.
Isn't the office area safe to enter?

81
00:05:13,264 --> 00:05:16,629
You said there weren't any signals
from the survivors over here.

82
00:05:16,714 --> 00:05:19,304
Let's use possible methods first please!

83
00:05:19,595 --> 00:05:21,043
There are some important
documents in the office.

84
00:05:21,128 --> 00:05:25,227
Are you saying we should disregard
people's lives for some documents?

85
00:05:25,312 --> 00:05:26,412
Hey, you.

86
00:05:27,152 --> 00:05:28,840
I think you're somewhat confused.

87
00:05:29,013 --> 00:05:30,613
The person in charge of this site is me,

88
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:33,632
the Urk Electric Power Corporation
Chief Manager.

89
00:05:33,717 --> 00:05:34,559
Me!

90
00:05:34,739 --> 00:05:37,500
So you do whatever I tell you to do...

91
00:05:37,584 --> 00:05:40,892
At a disaster site, the commander of the
rescue team has the final authority.

92
00:05:41,684 --> 00:05:42,678
And that's me.

93
00:05:47,824 --> 00:05:50,601
Which bastard keeps on letting
civilians enter the rescue site?

94
00:05:50,827 --> 00:05:51,684
Hey you!

95
00:05:51,864 --> 00:05:53,095
Please leave the site.

96
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,420
-You leave.
-Please leave.

97
00:05:54,504 --> 00:05:55,652
You leave instead, you bastard.

98
00:05:55,872 --> 00:05:57,546
Won't you get out of my way?
Hey, you bastard!

99
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,108
Hey, you, piece of rice!

100
00:05:59,198 --> 00:06:00,874
You understand me, bastard?

101
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,854
Tell the Lieutenant Colonel
to come out, you bastard!

102
00:06:03,804 --> 00:06:06,112
Let me go, you bastard!

103
00:06:07,003 --> 00:06:10,459
If we can't go from the top, how about
going in from the bottom using air bags?

104
00:06:10,544 --> 00:06:11,379
Not possible.

105
00:06:11,464 --> 00:06:14,029
The maximum weight an airbag
can withstand is only 10 tons.

106
00:06:14,114 --> 00:06:15,313
That's for one airbag.

107
00:06:15,572 --> 00:06:18,276
But if we used four at the pressure
point and lifted it at the same time,

108
00:06:18,361 --> 00:06:19,620
it might be possible.

109
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:29,153
But we only have one air pump.

110
00:06:29,484 --> 00:06:31,954
It is impossible to supply air
to all four of them simultaneously.

111
00:06:32,794 --> 00:06:34,101
That's the problem.

112
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,949
What if we fill the rest with water?

113
00:06:40,806 --> 00:06:42,522
The hydrant water supply lines
are still working.

114
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:45,158
We can cover the airbags with tarpaulin,

115
00:06:45,528 --> 00:06:48,495
and fill three airbags
with water simultaneously.

116
00:06:48,794 --> 00:06:50,033
It is connected.

117
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:54,890
It might work,

118
00:06:55,007 --> 00:06:57,642
but I don't think a water-filled air bag
won't last for a long time.

119
00:06:57,754 --> 00:06:59,668
As soon as we secure enough space
to slide through,

120
00:07:00,036 --> 00:07:01,288
we can install supporting
stands from inside,

121
00:07:01,373 --> 00:07:02,680
and keep it open as long as possible.

122
00:07:04,614 --> 00:07:05,682
Let's give it a try.

123
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,206
The plan has been decided. Let's hurry.

124
00:07:08,306 --> 00:07:09,329
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

125
00:07:26,788 --> 00:07:28,283
I think it's gastrointestinal perforation.

126
00:07:28,384 --> 00:07:29,660
It may lead to peritonitis, if untreated.

127
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,829
Transfer him to the Medicube.

128
00:07:30,914 --> 00:07:32,314
We don't have any
transportation vehicles.

129
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:35,458
Vehicle 3 is under repair, so only
vehicle 2 is going around now.

130
00:07:35,543 --> 00:07:37,024
I can't believe this.

131
00:07:37,245 --> 00:07:38,465
Can we use a phone yet?

132
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:39,557
No.

133
00:07:40,037 --> 00:07:41,130
Doctor! Doctor!

134
00:07:41,215 --> 00:07:42,050
Doctor!

135
00:07:42,135 --> 00:07:42,976
Here you go.

136
00:07:43,061 --> 00:07:44,893
-Here you are.
-Where did you get this from?

137
00:07:44,978 --> 00:07:46,757
There's that one foreign doctor, right?

138
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:48,633
He brought some patients to Medicube.

139
00:07:48,778 --> 00:07:51,722
He said that a village near
the city nearly disappeared.

140
00:07:51,903 --> 00:07:53,503
And told me to give these around.

141
00:07:53,651 --> 00:07:55,770
You should use channel number three.

142
00:07:56,841 --> 00:07:58,345
Doctor Kang, can you hear me?

143
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,250
Daniel? Thank you so much
for the walkie-talkies.

144
00:08:01,335 --> 00:08:02,641
Thanks to you, our job became easier.

145
00:08:03,264 --> 00:08:04,451
Nurse! Nurse!

146
00:08:04,536 --> 00:08:06,506
If you're thankful, then give me
permission to use the OR.

147
00:08:06,591 --> 00:08:08,252
It's a massive bleeding
and a skull fracture,

148
00:08:08,337 --> 00:08:10,469
but they said I can't use the OR
without your permission.

149
00:08:10,554 --> 00:08:12,077
I don't even have
the guardian's permission,

150
00:08:12,162 --> 00:08:14,147
and I'm about to do a surgery
in front of the OR. Over.

151
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:16,237
It sounds like a medical litigation
waiting to happen.

152
00:08:16,322 --> 00:08:17,649
Is the manager next to you?

153
00:08:18,025 --> 00:08:19,362
You can hear me, right?

154
00:08:20,006 --> 00:08:22,249
What? Do you want him
to make an appointment?

155
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:23,907
Do you think we're in Samcheondong?

156
00:08:25,126 --> 00:08:26,543
I'm opening it.

157
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,624
It's open. Thank you.

158
00:08:32,551 --> 00:08:33,594
Please save his life.

159
00:08:33,686 --> 00:08:36,699
Save him so he can file
a suit against you.

160
00:08:36,784 --> 00:08:39,540
Roger! I sent Yehwa to you
in case you need an extra hand.

161
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:42,518
I'll need both hands and feet.
Thank you. Over.

162
00:09:03,804 --> 00:09:06,496
Trusting in air bags
that might explode anytime.

163
00:09:06,668 --> 00:09:10,585
You're telling me that you're going
to crawl in underneath that concrete.

164
00:09:11,994 --> 00:09:15,889
Who's crazy enough to do that,
unless they have a death wish?

165
00:09:17,736 --> 00:09:18,607
We're doing it.

166
00:09:20,054 --> 00:09:21,844
We've completed installing airbags.

167
00:09:53,273 --> 00:09:54,607
Situation room.

168
00:09:54,703 --> 00:09:56,960
We have secured an access to the basement.

169
00:09:57,484 --> 00:10:00,169
We will initiate a rescue.

170
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:02,546
Please send the medical team to the site.

171
00:10:17,354 --> 00:10:18,352
We are alive.

172
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,417
-You're safe!
-I'm here.

173
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:21,792
Thank God you're alive.

174
00:10:26,724 --> 00:10:27,564
Are you okay?

175
00:10:30,584 --> 00:10:31,465
This way.

176
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:37,208
Patient, what is you name?

177
00:10:37,308 --> 00:10:40,203
Park Yongman. I'm Park Yongman.

178
00:10:40,367 --> 00:10:41,532
I'm okay.

179
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,054
but somewhere below where we were...

180
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:44,876
I don't know exactly where they are...

181
00:10:46,111 --> 00:10:47,712
I heard the Manager Go in there.

182
00:10:48,989 --> 00:10:51,579
They are searching
for more survivors right now.

183
00:10:52,644 --> 00:10:53,721
Don't worry.

184
00:11:12,622 --> 00:11:15,400
Blood pressure 60/30. Drowsy condition.
Get him an IV.

185
00:11:15,484 --> 00:11:16,325
Yes.

186
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:19,880
We're all out.

187
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:22,741
-Here.
-Thank you.

188
00:11:26,024 --> 00:11:26,950
Abdominal hemorrhage?

189
00:11:27,034 --> 00:11:28,796
He has abdominal distention
and a weak pulse.

190
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,581
He lost consciousness.
Inject 10ml of Epinephrine.

191
00:11:55,022 --> 00:11:56,493
His pulse is back.

192
00:11:57,284 --> 00:11:59,357
It looks like a shock induced
by abdominal hemorrhage.

193
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,603
I need to perform laparotomy.

194
00:12:00,688 --> 00:12:02,217
Please prepare a transportation
to Medicube.

195
00:12:02,382 --> 00:12:04,023
All the operating rooms
in Medicube are full.

196
00:12:04,108 --> 00:12:05,369
How far is the HQ from here?

197
00:12:05,454 --> 00:12:07,573
Even by helicopter, it will
take at least thirty minutes.

198
00:12:07,658 --> 00:12:08,940
This patient won't last that long.

199
00:12:09,024 --> 00:12:10,476
Then we'll have to do it here.

200
00:12:11,584 --> 00:12:12,827
Do what here?

201
00:12:13,303 --> 00:12:14,846
His pulse is irregular.

202
00:12:15,259 --> 00:12:16,111
The surgery.

203
00:12:16,753 --> 00:12:18,263
It's not suitable here.

204
00:12:19,157 --> 00:12:20,707
Over there, where the sun is,
will be good.

205
00:12:20,955 --> 00:12:22,749
-It's too dark in here.
-Are you out of your mind?

206
00:12:22,834 --> 00:12:24,467
How can you operate
with doing a CT scan?

207
00:12:24,551 --> 00:12:26,170
We can't even confirm
where he is bleeding.

208
00:12:26,255 --> 00:12:28,002
So that's why we have to open
his stomach and examine it.

209
00:12:28,087 --> 00:12:29,951
Is there another way for this patient?

210
00:12:31,345 --> 00:12:34,626
You want to cut him open in the middle
of a rescue site, filled with cement dust?

211
00:12:35,024 --> 00:12:36,999
Do you know how many side
effects could happen?

212
00:12:37,105 --> 00:12:39,142
Septicemia, fat embolism, kidney
failure, kidney adhesion...

213
00:12:39,227 --> 00:12:41,387
Is there another way for this patient?

214
00:12:42,669 --> 00:12:44,700
Choose quickly. He's your patient.

215
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:48,561
I'm going crazy.

216
00:12:52,202 --> 00:12:53,784
Please get the surgical scalpel set.

217
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,377
Also get as much as Betadine and
antiseptic gauze as possible.

218
00:12:56,462 --> 00:12:57,311
Yes.

219
00:13:00,051 --> 00:13:02,004
First, we have to move
him out of the shade.

220
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:08,436
Yehwa, please help us here!

221
00:13:09,983 --> 00:13:12,048
Doctor, here you go.
It's set on channel three.

222
00:13:12,132 --> 00:13:12,989
Thank you.

223
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:15,620
Doctor, here!

224
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,129
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

225
00:13:20,214 --> 00:13:21,470
I'm really sorry.

226
00:13:21,954 --> 00:13:22,897
It's fine.

227
00:13:23,066 --> 00:13:25,697
If you're injured, just stay still.
I'll do it.

228
00:13:25,987 --> 00:13:26,895
I'm sorry.

229
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:30,480
Please get me the surgical
scalpel set and Betadine.

230
00:13:31,629 --> 00:13:33,211
Was there another aftershock here?

231
00:13:33,353 --> 00:13:35,532
No, it was my fault.

232
00:13:35,617 --> 00:13:37,525
What are you looking for? Vitamins?

233
00:13:38,592 --> 00:13:39,986
How much of Betadine?

234
00:13:40,211 --> 00:13:41,292
Everything there is.

235
00:13:41,377 --> 00:13:43,119
Can I take the disinfectants too?

236
00:13:43,204 --> 00:13:44,047
Excuse me.

237
00:13:56,566 --> 00:13:57,853
We'll sit down for a moment.

238
00:14:01,094 --> 00:14:02,683
-I'll take care of her.
-Yes.

239
00:14:23,521 --> 00:14:24,981
It's anesthetic.

240
00:14:30,414 --> 00:14:31,867
This is really frustrating.

241
00:14:33,214 --> 00:14:35,306
Are you saying you won't get
the shot because you're afraid of shots?

242
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:37,826
Even though you're in this much pain?

243
00:14:38,914 --> 00:14:40,501
She doesn't even speak English.

244
00:14:43,245 --> 00:14:44,090
Look.

245
00:14:44,663 --> 00:14:45,961
This is anesthetic.

246
00:14:50,904 --> 00:14:51,995
Just let go.

247
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,704
This person, really.

248
00:14:57,903 --> 00:14:59,967
No. No anesthetics.

249
00:15:00,634 --> 00:15:02,210
I'm pregnant.
Anesthetics is dangerous for the baby.

250
00:15:02,294 --> 00:15:03,899
What are you saying?

251
00:15:03,984 --> 00:15:05,275
Then what do you want me to do?

252
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:16,943
My baby.

253
00:15:21,274 --> 00:15:22,170
You're pregnant?

254
00:15:24,278 --> 00:15:25,128
Baby?

255
00:15:31,126 --> 00:15:32,249
No anesthetic.

256
00:15:32,334 --> 00:15:34,810
No anesthetics no matter what.

257
00:15:35,364 --> 00:15:37,745
Hurry and do it, just do it.

258
00:15:39,334 --> 00:15:40,319
I'm going crazy.

259
00:15:45,984 --> 00:15:47,647
It's going to really hurt.

260
00:15:49,914 --> 00:15:51,151
Can you endure it?

261
00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:53,329
Okay?

262
00:15:57,024 --> 00:15:57,869
Okay.

263
00:16:05,374 --> 00:16:06,373
Then, I'm doing it.

264
00:16:08,774 --> 00:16:12,623
One, two, three.

265
00:16:34,274 --> 00:16:36,251
Doctor Kim! Doctor Kim!

266
00:16:41,784 --> 00:16:44,189
Hi. I'm Martin from the World Times.

267
00:16:44,381 --> 00:16:45,842
Is this the casualty count?

268
00:16:47,124 --> 00:16:48,609
My name is Gibeom.

269
00:16:48,694 --> 00:16:49,911
Ah, yes.

270
00:16:49,996 --> 00:16:51,808
You're with the Korean army, right?

271
00:16:52,614 --> 00:16:54,433
Could you fill me in on the situation?

272
00:16:55,778 --> 00:16:57,129
What do I say?

273
00:16:57,706 --> 00:16:59,030
I am a soldier!

274
00:17:00,974 --> 00:17:01,835
Okay?

275
00:17:02,242 --> 00:17:03,893
Nurse Ha! Nurse Ha!

276
00:17:04,487 --> 00:17:06,880
She is a doctor... that's not it.

277
00:17:07,904 --> 00:17:09,177
She's Nightingale.

278
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:10,788
Come on, come on, come on!

279
00:17:11,654 --> 00:17:13,114
He's a real American. An American.

280
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,340
Are you a nurse?

281
00:17:14,425 --> 00:17:15,599
May I ask you a couple of things?

282
00:17:15,684 --> 00:17:16,980
I am busy.

283
00:17:23,366 --> 00:17:24,220
Doctor Song!

284
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:26,452
He is a doctor! Come on, come on, come on!

285
00:17:27,624 --> 00:17:28,895
This is an American person.

286
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,753
What is the latest situation?
The casualty count is...

287
00:17:31,838 --> 00:17:35,390
I'm not good at English.
So, I beg your pardon.

288
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:39,899
This is Medicube. Is there
a doctor available to come here?

289
00:17:39,984 --> 00:17:41,735
We're short-handed.

290
00:17:42,384 --> 00:17:44,032
This is Doctor Song, I'll be there.

291
00:17:44,124 --> 00:17:45,659
Yes. Quickly please.

292
00:17:45,744 --> 00:17:46,789
Got it. Over.

293
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,595
Hey! Hey! Hey!

294
00:17:55,273 --> 00:17:58,004
I will do the interview
if you take me to the hospital.

295
00:17:58,487 --> 00:17:59,874
Come on. Hurry!

296
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:02,798
Okay.

297
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:12,076
Wow, so cool.

298
00:18:12,787 --> 00:18:15,876
He is normally useless
but he is very useful as a doctor.

299
00:18:18,174 --> 00:18:20,496
Attention! We're in need of type AB blood.

300
00:18:20,581 --> 00:18:23,221
Urgently! Anyone who hears,
please respond back quickly.

301
00:18:23,627 --> 00:18:27,379
Private Kim Gibeom, here.
I am blood type AB.

302
00:18:29,284 --> 00:18:31,107
Please wipe here. I can't see well.

303
00:18:32,175 --> 00:18:33,924
Stabilize the retractor here.

304
00:18:34,444 --> 00:18:35,754
He's blood type AB.

305
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,845
I'll be taking your blood.
It will sting a bit.

306
00:18:42,617 --> 00:18:43,539
Doctor Kang,

307
00:18:44,594 --> 00:18:45,588
Did you get hurt?

308
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:46,760
Not me,

309
00:18:47,016 --> 00:18:48,599
but they need a doctor to go inside.

310
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:50,146
Quickly, it's urgent.

311
00:18:55,787 --> 00:18:56,846
Manager!

312
00:19:00,068 --> 00:19:01,441
The doctor is here.

313
00:19:02,064 --> 00:19:04,549
It's dangerous. Why did you
come all the way here?

314
00:19:04,634 --> 00:19:06,230
I'll give you some painkillers for now.

315
00:19:09,954 --> 00:19:13,106
Do you have any sensation
in your leg or toes?

316
00:19:13,914 --> 00:19:18,125
At my age, what strength
would I have down there?

317
00:19:23,865 --> 00:19:26,280
It's moving, right?

318
00:19:28,424 --> 00:19:32,179
It was hurting so much until now.

319
00:19:32,787 --> 00:19:37,171
Seeing your face took all that pain away.

320
00:19:37,504 --> 00:19:39,768
Yes. You did well.

321
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:44,517
How long will it take to lift this up?

322
00:19:45,294 --> 00:19:48,479
There's another patient
that you have to see.

323
00:19:50,642 --> 00:19:52,019
Hurry.

324
00:19:52,154 --> 00:19:52,996
It hurts.

325
00:19:53,328 --> 00:19:54,350
Hurry, hurry.

326
00:19:54,434 --> 00:19:55,412
Don't move.

327
00:19:55,746 --> 00:19:57,485
You are lucky it missed your heart.

328
00:19:57,614 --> 00:19:58,716
But if you move,

329
00:19:59,024 --> 00:20:00,417
it might hit your spine.

330
00:20:01,384 --> 00:20:03,385
Am I going to die?

331
00:20:03,654 --> 00:20:05,036
Try to stay still.

332
00:20:05,478 --> 00:20:06,416
You won't die.

333
00:20:08,626 --> 00:20:11,916
We have to cut the steel beam and move
his impaled body to the operating room.

334
00:20:13,568 --> 00:20:15,118
Please cut it about here.

335
00:20:15,684 --> 00:20:18,006
Let's discuss the situation.

336
00:20:18,768 --> 00:20:19,685
Go ahead.

337
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,507
Just the two of us.

338
00:20:32,284 --> 00:20:33,771
Is there a problem?

339
00:20:35,017 --> 00:20:38,312
The problem is that
both sides are connected.

340
00:20:52,078 --> 00:20:54,321
If we lift the concrete off
of Manager Go's side,

341
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,211
the beam will be raised.

342
00:21:01,424 --> 00:21:03,613
Then , it will go through
the other patient.

343
00:21:04,205 --> 00:21:06,271
What if you cut the beam first?

344
00:21:07,424 --> 00:21:10,276
That will change
the structure's stability,

345
00:21:11,193 --> 00:21:14,262
and the concrete slabs won't be
able to support the extra load.

346
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:18,665
In order to save one side,

347
00:21:19,621 --> 00:21:21,129
the other side

348
00:21:21,214 --> 00:21:22,993
will have to die,
is that what you're saying?

349
00:21:25,527 --> 00:21:27,141
Scientifically, there isn't any other way.

350
00:21:27,226 --> 00:21:28,998
Medically, there isn't any
other option, either.

351
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:32,180
In these circumstances, we have to
follow the rules of rescue and priority.

352
00:21:33,002 --> 00:21:34,439
According to the doctor's judgment,

353
00:21:34,534 --> 00:21:37,154
we have to first save the person
with the higher chance of survival.

354
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:39,629
So, you're telling me

355
00:21:40,325 --> 00:21:41,665
to make the choice right now?

356
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:44,771
Who to kill of the two, and who to save?

357
00:21:45,047 --> 00:21:45,896
Yes.

358
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:47,617
That is...

359
00:21:48,911 --> 00:21:50,751
...what you must do right now.

360
00:22:03,144 --> 00:22:05,766
They are currently preparing
for whichever side it will be.

361
00:22:06,113 --> 00:22:07,458
It will be ready in ten minutes.

362
00:22:12,161 --> 00:22:13,258
Has the decision been made?

363
00:22:13,539 --> 00:22:14,669
Give me ten minutes.

364
00:22:14,754 --> 00:22:16,048
There isn't any time.

365
00:22:21,511 --> 00:22:22,538
Go ahead and do that.

366
00:22:32,074 --> 00:22:34,742
She made that request as a doctor.

367
00:22:35,544 --> 00:22:37,791
-We'll do our final check as well.
-Yes, sir.

368
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:48,238
What is this? Captain Yoo,
haven't you started working?

369
00:22:49,895 --> 00:22:51,916
So frustrating, seriously!

370
00:22:52,355 --> 00:22:55,603
You said that one of them
won't make it anyway.

371
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,728
Then quickly wrap things
up with the easier one,

372
00:22:59,813 --> 00:23:01,530
and start breaking through
to the office, okay?

373
00:23:03,292 --> 00:23:05,071
We are preparing in the order of priority.

374
00:23:05,536 --> 00:23:07,722
Where do you think you're going,
I'm not finished talking!

375
00:23:09,832 --> 00:23:11,708
Do you know exactly
what those documents are?

376
00:23:12,388 --> 00:23:14,042
Those documents are,

377
00:23:14,127 --> 00:23:17,388
treaties on peaceful business
reconstruction with the Urk government.

378
00:23:18,232 --> 00:23:20,750
This country may be paying me,

379
00:23:20,835 --> 00:23:24,152
but as a Korean citizen, I'm saying
this because of my patriotism.

380
00:23:25,086 --> 00:23:28,153
When I go to karaoke rooms,
I always starts with the national anthem.

381
00:23:28,476 --> 00:23:29,603
Do you get it now?

382
00:23:29,891 --> 00:23:32,397
This is a problem at a national level.

383
00:23:33,989 --> 00:23:35,061
You're a soldier.

384
00:23:36,401 --> 00:23:39,220
Shouldn't a soldier do his duty
for his country first and foremost?

385
00:23:39,572 --> 00:23:43,077
The problem in this mess
isn't who is going to live or die.

386
00:23:43,161 --> 00:23:44,022
Hey.

387
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,010
"Hey"?

388
00:23:46,537 --> 00:23:47,436
Did you just...

389
00:23:47,521 --> 00:23:49,587
Yeah, I'm talking to you, you jerk.

390
00:23:51,927 --> 00:23:52,820
Nation.

391
00:23:53,963 --> 00:23:55,070
What is a nation?

392
00:23:55,732 --> 00:23:58,680
The lives and the safety
of its citizens is a nation's priority.

393
00:23:58,781 --> 00:24:00,246
What that means is,

394
00:24:01,651 --> 00:24:03,548
even if a jerk like you is in danger,

395
00:24:03,731 --> 00:24:06,889
the nation will do whatever
it takes to save him.

396
00:24:07,244 --> 00:24:08,650
As a soldier...

397
00:24:09,415 --> 00:24:13,063
...nothing is more important
than saving the life of a Korean citizen.

398
00:24:14,921 --> 00:24:16,741
If those documents
are so important to you,

399
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,075
then go dig them up yourself.

400
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:30,726
I can't believe this.

401
00:24:34,071 --> 00:24:35,761
You're making a big mistake right now.

402
00:24:35,851 --> 00:24:36,964
Then I'll be thankful.

403
00:24:38,273 --> 00:24:39,120
Get lost.

404
00:24:42,791 --> 00:24:44,056
Watch out!

405
00:25:06,021 --> 00:25:07,200
Is everyone okay?

406
00:25:07,862 --> 00:25:09,768
Everyone is okay over here!

407
00:25:10,496 --> 00:25:11,957
Over... over there.

408
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:29,664
Are you okay?

409
00:25:32,001 --> 00:25:33,272
Oh me...

410
00:25:33,625 --> 00:25:34,474
Yes, I'm fine.

411
00:25:35,894 --> 00:25:36,751
I'm...

412
00:25:37,621 --> 00:25:40,587
Reporting, there's a live
wire in the work zone.

413
00:25:40,671 --> 00:25:41,863
Check over everything again.

414
00:25:41,948 --> 00:25:43,207
Yes, I will.

415
00:26:07,235 --> 00:26:10,663
Once the rescue operation starts and
the concrete slab gets lifted,

416
00:26:10,748 --> 00:26:12,810
it will be extremely painful
during the process.

417
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,245
Painkillers won't be any use.

418
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:15,580
He has three kids.

419
00:26:16,539 --> 00:26:18,115
A boy and two girls.

420
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:19,500
Excuse me?

421
00:26:19,846 --> 00:26:21,401
That guy over there...

422
00:26:22,001 --> 00:26:23,849
I may not know much,

423
00:26:24,187 --> 00:26:25,980
but it will be difficult
to save both of us, right?

424
00:26:31,419 --> 00:26:32,625
It's okay.

425
00:26:33,001 --> 00:26:36,274
Since the days of speeding on the highways
through the deserts of Saudi Arabia,

426
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:38,146
I've worked globally for 30 years.

427
00:26:38,231 --> 00:26:40,282
I can sense what's going on.

428
00:26:40,441 --> 00:26:42,290
I understand the gist of it.

429
00:26:45,161 --> 00:26:46,559
No matter what happens,

430
00:26:47,111 --> 00:26:48,643
we're going to do the best we can.

431
00:26:49,771 --> 00:26:50,635
Okay,

432
00:26:51,304 --> 00:26:52,579
please do so.

433
00:26:55,839 --> 00:27:00,795
It's great just laying here
and staring at the sky,

434
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:02,973
without having to do any work.

435
00:27:03,719 --> 00:27:06,017
I feel so blessed.

436
00:27:07,938 --> 00:27:10,813
I worked long enough and earned enough,

437
00:27:11,378 --> 00:27:12,837
to send my kids to college.

438
00:27:17,231 --> 00:27:19,551
Can you give me more painkillers?

439
00:27:20,361 --> 00:27:22,279
It hurts like crazy.

440
00:27:23,651 --> 00:27:25,209
No more painkillers.

441
00:27:25,651 --> 00:27:28,754
You have to go under anesthesia
for your surgery later on.

442
00:27:31,041 --> 00:27:32,382
Can you clench your fist?

443
00:27:40,111 --> 00:27:41,483
Am I going to live?

444
00:27:42,671 --> 00:27:45,366
Please, save me. Please.

445
00:27:46,891 --> 00:27:48,406
I didn't move one bit.

446
00:27:49,649 --> 00:27:50,922
I promise.

447
00:27:52,931 --> 00:27:53,774
Good.

448
00:27:59,893 --> 00:28:01,521
I'll need to make the incision,

449
00:28:01,691 --> 00:28:03,007
3cm from here.

450
00:28:03,261 --> 00:28:04,766
-At the right angle.
-Yes.

451
00:28:11,805 --> 00:28:14,022
When this patient survives,
get him to buy you a meal.

452
00:28:14,301 --> 00:28:15,486
Will he survive?

453
00:28:15,571 --> 00:28:17,019
Aren't you in the process of saving him?

454
00:28:17,481 --> 00:28:18,774
Are you talking about me?

455
00:28:20,306 --> 00:28:22,287
Private Kim Gibeom.

456
00:28:22,977 --> 00:28:25,322
Are you saying that I'm saving a person?

457
00:28:26,311 --> 00:28:28,200
May I brag to Sergeant Major Seo?

458
00:28:28,323 --> 00:28:29,471
Wait your turn.

459
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:31,020
Because I'm going to first.

460
00:28:41,566 --> 00:28:44,329
Yehwa, we didn't come to Urk for this.

461
00:28:44,757 --> 00:28:48,246
They didn't come to Urk
to get hurt either.

462
00:28:48,791 --> 00:28:49,984
You'll keep your promise?

463
00:28:50,069 --> 00:28:52,683
Of course. It's a blood promise.

464
00:28:53,035 --> 00:28:56,149
A, There's the head of Haesung Hospital.

465
00:28:56,575 --> 00:28:59,178
B, The head of Mowuru Power Plants.

466
00:28:59,499 --> 00:29:03,003
C, The head of the Taebaek Unit.

467
00:29:03,531 --> 00:29:04,828
Who do you want to interview?

468
00:29:05,232 --> 00:29:08,158
-D, Daniel Spencer.
-Daniel Spencer!

469
00:29:09,342 --> 00:29:11,916
He wasn't in your options!

470
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:15,625
It'd be nice to have someone
who's a veteran with disaster scenes.

471
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:21,093
I know, you guys think that
he's so famous and smart, but...

472
00:29:22,724 --> 00:29:24,116
it's all about the look.

473
00:29:24,201 --> 00:29:26,586
That's exactly why we want Daniel.

474
00:29:26,961 --> 00:29:30,237
Not only can he talk,
but he's also got the look.

475
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:34,010
These rotten tabloids!

476
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,239
Both situations don't look good.

477
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:48,261
There's a danger
of second explosion,

478
00:29:48,346 --> 00:29:49,858
because of the oxygen tanks
used for welding.

479
00:29:52,264 --> 00:29:53,597
The ground here isn't firm.

480
00:29:54,371 --> 00:29:55,963
-Be careful.
-Yes, sir.

481
00:30:00,852 --> 00:30:02,023
Sergeant Major Seo!

482
00:30:02,845 --> 00:30:03,695
What happened?

483
00:30:03,988 --> 00:30:05,380
The floor gave way.

484
00:30:05,465 --> 00:30:06,917
Sergeant Major Seo fell!

485
00:30:07,001 --> 00:30:08,946
Didn't something happen
to Sergeant Major Seo?

486
00:30:09,031 --> 00:30:10,068
Can I take this bandage off?

487
00:30:10,153 --> 00:30:11,364
-Private Kim, sit down!
-But...

488
00:30:11,449 --> 00:30:13,092
Sit down or this man dies.

489
00:30:18,351 --> 00:30:19,544
3.0 suture scissors.

490
00:30:20,059 --> 00:30:21,311
Ah... yes.

491
00:30:31,085 --> 00:30:32,109
Wolf to Command.

492
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:35,150
Luckily, I fell on top of sand,
so I didn't sustain a big injury.

493
00:30:35,331 --> 00:30:36,353
I'm okay.

494
00:30:37,081 --> 00:30:39,307
That's a relief.
Sergeant Major Seo seems to be fine.

495
00:30:39,391 --> 00:30:40,467
Be quiet.

496
00:30:40,615 --> 00:30:41,661
You're distracting me.

497
00:30:52,704 --> 00:30:54,423
We are ready.

498
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:58,771
Have you decided?

499
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:03,838
In Manager Go's case, necrosis
in his leg muscles have already begun.

500
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,617
Once you remove the concrete slab,

501
00:31:06,701 --> 00:31:08,708
there is a high probability
of him having crush syndrome.

502
00:31:10,608 --> 00:31:15,642
As for the local worker, the steel frame
is preventing him from bleeding out.

503
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:17,185
Even if we move him to the OR,

504
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:19,694
it would not be easy
to stop massive blood loss.

505
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:24,504
In this circumstance, if you were me...

506
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:27,770
...who would you save?

507
00:31:33,019 --> 00:31:34,688
Why are you asking me that?

508
00:31:35,636 --> 00:31:36,751
You've examined them,

509
00:31:37,269 --> 00:31:38,350
and diagnosed them.

510
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:41,455
Now make the call.

511
00:31:42,642 --> 00:31:43,570
But still,

512
00:31:44,352 --> 00:31:47,013
you are more experienced, than I am.

513
00:31:47,385 --> 00:31:49,372
I thought you would be able
to make the best choice.

514
00:31:49,501 --> 00:31:50,342
The best?

515
00:31:51,171 --> 00:31:53,746
Do you think
what we are doing is what's best?

516
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:58,706
In a rescue site, there is no
such thing as the best decision.

517
00:31:59,762 --> 00:32:01,170
We're just solving the problems...

518
00:32:02,017 --> 00:32:03,433
...that are in front of us.

519
00:32:03,687 --> 00:32:05,397
I know that, but...

520
00:32:05,932 --> 00:32:09,227
I've been treating people all day
without structure or protocol.

521
00:32:09,312 --> 00:32:10,391
I don't know if this is right...

522
00:32:10,476 --> 00:32:11,624
You are doing well.

523
00:32:12,662 --> 00:32:14,928
Despite the poor conditions,
you either do your best...

524
00:32:15,492 --> 00:32:17,181
...or do nothing and let them die.

525
00:32:17,672 --> 00:32:19,271
It's either one or the other.

526
00:32:20,172 --> 00:32:21,910
This is not the time to whine.

527
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,028
We don't expect you...

528
00:32:26,251 --> 00:32:28,292
...to have absolute perfection
or the skill of a God

529
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:33,160
A doctor who can't even find
a proper treatment for a common cold.

530
00:32:34,928 --> 00:32:36,882
All I expect from you is...

531
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:38,768
...that level of diagnosis

532
00:32:41,662 --> 00:32:43,143
So tell me your decision...

533
00:32:45,332 --> 00:32:46,215
...as a doctor.

534
00:33:00,692 --> 00:33:01,961
The order of rescue is...

535
00:33:12,569 --> 00:33:14,120
The steel beam went through his chest,

536
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:16,327
but I'm not sure if it touched the spine.

537
00:33:16,412 --> 00:33:18,006
Luckily, he's still responsive.

538
00:33:18,091 --> 00:33:20,090
Administer general antibiotics
and take an X-ray...

539
00:33:20,175 --> 00:33:21,038
I know.

540
00:33:22,219 --> 00:33:23,771
You already said that over the radio.

541
00:33:24,649 --> 00:33:26,601
Leave this patient to me
and go get some rest.

542
00:33:26,686 --> 00:33:28,208
No, I will do it.

543
00:33:28,293 --> 00:33:30,146
The portable x-ray is set up, right?

544
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:31,670
We're out of film.

545
00:33:31,755 --> 00:33:33,014
The sterilizer is broken too.

546
00:33:33,212 --> 00:33:34,117
It's a mess right now.

547
00:33:34,202 --> 00:33:35,921
Even if it's a mess, let's do something.

548
00:33:36,006 --> 00:33:37,888
Sanghyun, you come in too.
I can't do it alone.

549
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:39,053
Let's go.

550
00:33:48,266 --> 00:33:49,361
He's under.

551
00:33:49,446 --> 00:33:50,581
This patient...

552
00:33:52,127 --> 00:33:54,037
...will not die here today.

553
00:33:56,607 --> 00:33:57,922
We will take out the beam,

554
00:33:58,308 --> 00:33:59,500
with speed and accuracy.

555
00:34:00,374 --> 00:34:01,240
Ready?

556
00:34:02,268 --> 00:34:05,744
one, two, three.

557
00:35:47,284 --> 00:35:49,334
His vitals are stable.

558
00:35:50,062 --> 00:35:51,250
You did a great job.

559
00:35:51,814 --> 00:35:53,002
You too.

560
00:35:57,419 --> 00:35:58,313
Well done.

561
00:35:59,627 --> 00:36:00,683
Salute!

562
00:36:26,773 --> 00:36:27,611
Salute!

563
00:36:29,392 --> 00:36:30,696
You all did a great job today.

564
00:36:31,252 --> 00:36:32,856
Now that the back up is here,

565
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:34,149
you can all go and rest.

566
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,383
-Good job.
-Thank you.

567
00:37:07,962 --> 00:37:10,535
They have reported that the rescue
operation is still going on.

568
00:37:10,732 --> 00:37:13,301
Fortunately, our soldiers
did not sustain any major injuries.

569
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:15,634
I received the report
that they are all safe.

570
00:37:15,799 --> 00:37:17,315
Then, Lieutenant Yoon also?

571
00:37:17,399 --> 00:37:19,196
Yes. She's fine.

572
00:37:20,059 --> 00:37:23,412
I stopped Captain Yoo from leaving too.

573
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:27,395
I know you are worried,
that is why I asked you to come.

574
00:37:28,516 --> 00:37:30,884
I'm not worried about a soldier
who is doing his work.

575
00:37:32,489 --> 00:37:34,603
I'm ashamed to say this but...

576
00:37:35,529 --> 00:37:38,786
I'm relieved that my daughter
is with Captain Yoo.

577
00:37:42,178 --> 00:37:45,152
I think highly of Captain Yoo.

578
00:37:46,029 --> 00:37:48,147
Shijin will easily become a general.

579
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:49,419
I have high expectations for him.

580
00:37:50,306 --> 00:37:53,036
I'm not sure if he is a
man of such caliber.

581
00:37:53,121 --> 00:37:54,853
He is a very admirable soldier.

582
00:37:54,989 --> 00:37:57,154
He has a lot of loyal people around him.

583
00:37:57,239 --> 00:38:00,660
My Shijin seems to be blessed
to have such kind people.

584
00:38:04,659 --> 00:38:07,014
We have just been inform
by the Taebaek Corps that,

585
00:38:07,099 --> 00:38:10,394
the medical team are safe and
are carrying rescue operations.

586
00:38:10,479 --> 00:38:11,688
Don't worry too much.

587
00:38:14,189 --> 00:38:17,112
Oh my! Child, are you alright?

588
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:19,035
Yes. I'm alright.

589
00:38:19,209 --> 00:38:20,725
That's a relief, Mother-in-law.

590
00:38:22,608 --> 00:38:24,528
When will the return flight
for the medical team be ready?

591
00:38:24,818 --> 00:38:27,274
The aircraft will be sent as soon
as the local airport is normalized.

592
00:38:27,387 --> 00:38:29,224
When will that be. No...

593
00:38:29,311 --> 00:38:31,772
Let me talk with Chihoon first.

594
00:38:31,857 --> 00:38:34,078
I need to hear his voice personally
to put my heart at ease.

595
00:38:34,163 --> 00:38:36,622
Their communication network
are not recovered yet.

596
00:38:36,707 --> 00:38:39,329
The calls can only go through via the
satellite phone in the headquarters.

597
00:38:39,459 --> 00:38:40,848
-Right now, we can't...
-Hey!

598
00:38:41,788 --> 00:38:43,670
I contributed to that satellite.

599
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:46,063
Put me through to him right away.
Right now!

600
00:38:48,865 --> 00:38:52,507
Your mother-in-law yelled at
the chairman, "Hey!"

601
00:38:54,408 --> 00:38:58,179
I heard that the hospital land
belongs to Chihoon's family.

602
00:39:00,378 --> 00:39:03,796
Madam, I have done nothing
to upset you, right?

603
00:39:10,419 --> 00:39:12,076
I'm sure he died.

604
00:39:20,177 --> 00:39:21,665
Oh my goodness.

605
00:39:31,399 --> 00:39:32,382
Are you done?

606
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:34,255
Yeah. Just a while ago.

607
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:38,254
Did the patient survive?

608
00:39:38,549 --> 00:39:39,530
For now.

609
00:39:43,243 --> 00:39:44,146
But you...

610
00:39:45,109 --> 00:39:46,371
I don't have a lighter.

611
00:39:50,894 --> 00:39:52,651
I'm asking if you're okay?

612
00:40:02,019 --> 00:40:03,681
What would I ask?

613
00:40:05,048 --> 00:40:06,387
Please give me one cigarette.

614
00:40:07,594 --> 00:40:09,658
What kind of doctor smokes?
Quit it this instant.

615
00:40:26,322 --> 00:40:27,228
Doctor.

616
00:40:27,953 --> 00:40:28,792
Nurse.

617
00:40:31,013 --> 00:40:32,062
Watch out!

618
00:40:32,529 --> 00:40:33,877
-Ah seriously.
-Nurse!

619
00:40:34,372 --> 00:40:35,404
Nurse!

620
00:40:44,094 --> 00:40:45,605
I am telling you to bring a doctor.

621
00:40:45,689 --> 00:40:47,366
Why don't you understand?

622
00:40:47,543 --> 00:40:48,494
You can't do this.

623
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:49,448
This...

624
00:40:50,184 --> 00:40:51,188
What's going on?

625
00:40:51,329 --> 00:40:53,592
Ms. Ha, that guy is...

626
00:40:53,677 --> 00:40:56,285
Oh yes. Now I have someone
who can understand me.

627
00:40:57,159 --> 00:40:58,191
You know me, right?

628
00:40:58,344 --> 00:41:01,339
I'm the chief manager of the
power plant, Jin Yeongsoo.

629
00:41:01,424 --> 00:41:02,574
What if I know you?

630
00:41:03,249 --> 00:41:07,078
I've been standing all day,
so my blood sugar dropped.

631
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:10,206
I am dizzy to death.

632
00:41:10,355 --> 00:41:11,199
Oh my.

633
00:41:12,256 --> 00:41:13,674
I'm dying.

634
00:41:13,878 --> 00:41:15,187
Oh my goodness.

635
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:23,885
Can you give me some glucose
or a vitamin shot over here?

636
00:41:24,124 --> 00:41:25,645
Give some to me.

637
00:41:26,369 --> 00:41:27,974
Put in some garlic too.

638
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:30,402
I told him he can't.

639
00:41:30,492 --> 00:41:32,065
It's fine. Get back to work.

640
00:41:32,874 --> 00:41:33,762
Okay.

641
00:41:36,339 --> 00:41:37,632
This is the B ward's head.

642
00:41:37,717 --> 00:41:41,190
There's a patient who's dying
because he wants vitamins.

643
00:41:41,589 --> 00:41:44,548
If there's a doctor
that is dying of boredom,

644
00:41:45,011 --> 00:41:47,367
please come here and
take care of the patient, over.

645
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,157
Is that so?

646
00:41:49,242 --> 00:41:51,349
What's the patient's condition?

647
00:41:51,618 --> 00:41:53,761
He seems to be needing immediate
attention for his eyes.

648
00:41:54,058 --> 00:41:55,305
Unless if he blind,

649
00:41:55,389 --> 00:41:58,799
there's no way that he can't see
the state the other patients are in.

650
00:41:59,206 --> 00:42:01,401
But he's saying that he's tired to death.

651
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,821
His mouth seems well alive though.

652
00:42:02,906 --> 00:42:05,540
He's full of bullshit.
I'm turning off. Over.

653
00:42:05,776 --> 00:42:07,144
Please!

654
00:42:09,957 --> 00:42:11,111
What is your name?

655
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:12,209
Ha Jaae.

656
00:42:12,709 --> 00:42:14,226
What did you say your name was earlier?

657
00:42:14,311 --> 00:42:15,412
What?

658
00:42:17,309 --> 00:42:18,563
Did you just speak to me informally?

659
00:42:18,648 --> 00:42:21,683
I thought you wanted us to be friends
because you talked informally first.

660
00:42:22,045 --> 00:42:23,301
We've done exchanging names.

661
00:42:23,621 --> 00:42:24,638
How old are you?

662
00:42:27,159 --> 00:42:28,753
Wow, really.

663
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,695
You. Just wait and see.

664
00:42:31,779 --> 00:42:35,143
Yes, yes, yes, yes. I'll do just that.

665
00:42:35,649 --> 00:42:36,862
Nurse Choi, come here.

666
00:42:38,458 --> 00:42:40,267
The sterilizer broke,
so we have a lot of work to do.

667
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:42,150
-Let's go.
-Yes, ma'am

668
00:42:43,979 --> 00:42:44,934
Hey!

669
00:42:48,847 --> 00:42:49,859
What do we do?

670
00:42:50,439 --> 00:42:53,528
With the remaining ration,
it will be hard to feed everyone,

671
00:42:53,829 --> 00:42:55,581
including the medical team
and the injured.

672
00:42:57,169 --> 00:42:59,022
We just got back from
a site of life and death,

673
00:42:59,339 --> 00:43:00,922
and another problem awaits.

674
00:43:02,366 --> 00:43:04,789
Well, we'll have to try to extend
our combat ration as much as we can.

675
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:19,412
I figured you'll be starving.

676
00:43:31,658 --> 00:43:32,765
Will this do?

677
00:43:34,243 --> 00:43:37,425
I've brought enough for 100 people.
For now.

678
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:39,377
Perfect. You are the best.

679
00:43:40,329 --> 00:43:43,011
We will buy you drinks for 100 people.

680
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:47,825
It's on Sergeant Seo.

681
00:43:49,639 --> 00:43:51,327
I had my pay cut.

682
00:43:57,317 --> 00:43:59,994
Squad One, come out and
get your meal.

683
00:44:13,553 --> 00:44:15,589
Sit down and listen while eating.

684
00:44:15,768 --> 00:44:16,634
At ease.

685
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,461
You worked hard without any sleep.

686
00:44:21,147 --> 00:44:24,485
The headquarter has contacted
your parents, so do not worry.

687
00:44:25,189 --> 00:44:26,579
As soon as the communication
network is recovered,

688
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,122
we'll let you make video calls.

689
00:44:28,493 --> 00:44:29,608
So please wait a bit.

690
00:44:29,973 --> 00:44:32,881
-Yes, Sir.
-Yes, Sir.

691
00:44:34,722 --> 00:44:37,187
We will continue to work
at the rescue site tomorrow.

692
00:44:37,754 --> 00:44:39,210
It will be another rough day.

693
00:44:39,439 --> 00:44:41,866
So after you finish your dinner,
go to sleep immediately.

694
00:44:43,405 --> 00:44:51,061
Don't think too deeply about the situation
we have seen today.  Forget about it.

695
00:44:52,057 --> 00:44:55,252
You guys only need
to follow commands well,

696
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:00,770
because I will always give you
the right commands.

697
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:03,338
Understand?

698
00:45:03,582 --> 00:45:05,629
-Yes, Sir.
-Yes, Sir.

699
00:45:07,615 --> 00:45:08,455
End of roll call.

700
00:45:44,554 --> 00:45:45,690
Was coming here,

701
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:47,780
Seo Daeyoung's will,

702
00:45:47,865 --> 00:45:49,206
or was it my father's command?

703
00:45:52,514 --> 00:45:55,602
Sending the most capable soldiers
to the most dangerous places,

704
00:45:55,864 --> 00:45:57,348
is commander's responsibility.

705
00:45:59,308 --> 00:46:01,622
I don't know why you're taking his side.

706
00:46:03,053 --> 00:46:04,845
For your information,
I'm not doing well.

707
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:06,389
Please call him.

708
00:46:06,644 --> 00:46:08,149
He is probably worried.

709
00:46:12,692 --> 00:46:14,236
How about you?

710
00:46:16,605 --> 00:46:19,207
If I wasn't safe, how would you have felt?

711
00:46:27,819 --> 00:46:29,386
All the times I ran away from you...

712
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,678
...I would have regretted them.

713
00:46:38,774 --> 00:46:40,342
And you're just standing there like that?

714
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:35,001
Move over.

715
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:36,400
It is my job.

716
00:47:36,485 --> 00:47:38,923
I will do your job, so move over.

717
00:47:45,065 --> 00:47:47,577
It's so inconvenient
without the sterilizer.

718
00:47:48,083 --> 00:47:50,066
Are you really not scared?

719
00:47:50,919 --> 00:47:52,144
What did I tell you?

720
00:47:52,271 --> 00:47:54,996
You should've ran away with me
when we had just arrived.

721
00:47:55,659 --> 00:47:58,988
Only if I was married, I could've run off
using my family as an excuse.

722
00:47:59,073 --> 00:48:00,750
You should've had then.

723
00:48:00,835 --> 00:48:03,138
-What have you been doing with your life?
-You're not the one to talk.

724
00:48:07,398 --> 00:48:08,683
Repeat after me.

725
00:48:09,329 --> 00:48:10,912
1030.

726
00:48:10,997 --> 00:48:13,716
1030. What is that?

727
00:48:13,801 --> 00:48:15,269
It's the password to my laptop.

728
00:48:16,099 --> 00:48:19,584
If I die here, go to the C drive
in my laptop.

729
00:48:19,669 --> 00:48:21,596
If you look there,
under the hospital documents,

730
00:48:21,681 --> 00:48:23,246
there should be a zip folder.

731
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:25,844
Please delete that folder.

732
00:48:25,967 --> 00:48:27,317
I am asking you for a favor as a friend.

733
00:48:27,402 --> 00:48:28,516
What is in there...

734
00:48:30,429 --> 00:48:31,395
Disgusting.

735
00:48:32,357 --> 00:48:33,354
Delete it immediately.

736
00:48:33,439 --> 00:48:35,867
You're going to see worse things
than you're imagining.

737
00:48:35,952 --> 00:48:39,142
-My gosh.
-That's why you have to do it yourself.

738
00:48:39,227 --> 00:48:41,038
Hey, you perverted bastard. 1030?

739
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:42,657
From 10 to 30 years old?

740
00:48:42,742 --> 00:48:43,869
Delete it immediately.

741
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:47,105
-Over my dead body.
-Oh my god.

742
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:48,529
This is all ready.

743
00:48:48,796 --> 00:48:50,107
Let's turn off the fire and go back in.

744
00:48:50,499 --> 00:48:51,507
It is all done.

745
00:48:53,519 --> 00:48:55,180
I am telling you to delete it.

746
00:48:55,885 --> 00:48:58,544
Hey. No, don't do that.

747
00:48:58,629 --> 00:49:01,034
You're so disgusting. My goodness.

748
00:49:02,889 --> 00:49:04,656
-Is he conscious?
-Not yet.

749
00:49:04,762 --> 00:49:06,792
I think we have to watch
him until tomorrow.

750
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:14,306
It's this patient, right?

751
00:49:14,704 --> 00:49:16,453
The patient who had surgery at the site.

752
00:49:16,538 --> 00:49:17,772
He has consciousness.

753
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:26,467
He is getting better.

754
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:28,951
Please check his vitals every three hours.

755
00:49:32,158 --> 00:49:33,495
She fractured her foot.

756
00:49:33,643 --> 00:49:35,530
Since she's pregnant,
we performed it without anesthetic.

757
00:49:35,615 --> 00:49:37,999
I think it hurt a lot.
She held it in well.

758
00:49:38,256 --> 00:49:39,594
Your baby is brave.

759
00:49:41,466 --> 00:49:43,492
But isn't that your phone?

760
00:49:43,577 --> 00:49:45,593
I had some classical music
that I always listen to.

761
00:49:45,678 --> 00:49:47,035
I wanted to help calm the baby.

762
00:49:48,463 --> 00:49:49,753
You've completely become a doctor.

763
00:49:49,979 --> 00:49:51,384
You've completely become a father as well.

764
00:49:57,548 --> 00:49:59,337
He listens to classical music?

765
00:50:00,978 --> 00:50:01,962
My gosh.

766
00:50:25,341 --> 00:50:26,655
The shoes were a great help.

767
00:50:28,302 --> 00:50:29,744
Thank you very much.

768
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:41,969
"Rescue Status:
18 deceased, 41 injured"

769
00:51:03,573 --> 00:51:08,165
"Unidentified person"

770
00:52:02,939 --> 00:52:04,761
-Be careful.
-I got this.

771
00:52:17,809 --> 00:52:18,963
Hey you rotten rascal!

772
00:52:19,048 --> 00:52:21,625
No matter how well you hide,
you can never hide from me.

773
00:52:21,709 --> 00:52:24,202
Let go and let's talk this out.

774
00:52:24,287 --> 00:52:25,585
Hello, Doctor.

775
00:52:26,112 --> 00:52:27,634
You're doing a great job.

776
00:53:11,209 --> 00:53:12,055
Salute!

777
00:53:14,019 --> 00:53:15,355
Is there anything you need?

778
00:53:16,572 --> 00:53:18,539
I'm just looking around. Nothing much.

779
00:53:19,526 --> 00:53:22,153
Didn't you hurt your shoulder?

780
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:24,544
Right.

781
00:53:25,379 --> 00:53:27,150
-Can you take a look at it for me?
-Yes, Sir.

782
00:53:33,784 --> 00:53:35,122
How did you bear the pain?

783
00:53:35,411 --> 00:53:36,672
I think you need stitches.

784
00:53:36,902 --> 00:53:37,999
No wonder.

785
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:39,492
It hurt a lot.

786
00:53:40,096 --> 00:53:41,989
-I will call the medical team.
-No, it's fine.

787
00:53:42,143 --> 00:53:43,010
I'll go myself.

788
00:53:43,236 --> 00:53:44,528
Please come this way.

789
00:53:56,754 --> 00:53:58,210
How did this happen?

790
00:54:01,688 --> 00:54:03,413
I was rescuing people
without taking caution.

791
00:54:11,135 --> 00:54:12,500
I am okay.

792
00:54:16,259 --> 00:54:17,398
Did you hear me?

793
00:54:18,929 --> 00:54:20,281
I was asking you inside my head though.

794
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:23,081
Yes.

795
00:54:23,538 --> 00:54:24,687
I heard it loud and clear.

796
00:54:32,025 --> 00:54:36,002
I'm glad you were here on the scene.

797
00:54:38,934 --> 00:54:40,362
I'm thankful...

798
00:54:43,328 --> 00:54:44,538
...that you fought here with me.

799
00:54:50,681 --> 00:54:51,853
Thank you too, Captain.

800
00:55:00,031 --> 00:55:02,840
I didn't mean to be mean to you earlier.

801
00:55:02,938 --> 00:55:04,122
I know.

802
00:55:07,398 --> 00:55:08,254
You know?

803
00:55:08,411 --> 00:55:10,449
Do you know how many years
I've been a doctor?

804
00:55:12,532 --> 00:55:16,786
The person who has seen
more deaths than the soldiers,

805
00:55:17,449 --> 00:55:19,040
is a doctor who hold the scalpel.

806
00:55:21,737 --> 00:55:23,157
If my words of comfort are too clumsy,

807
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:25,483
then I'll give up trying.

808
00:55:27,247 --> 00:55:28,086
But...

809
00:55:30,591 --> 00:55:32,931
...I really want you to be all right...

810
00:55:34,908 --> 00:55:35,897
...with all my heart.

811
00:55:44,035 --> 00:55:45,077
Then,

812
00:55:45,566 --> 00:55:47,241
instead of saying weird
things to comfort me,

813
00:55:47,563 --> 00:55:49,378
please do something you're good at.

814
00:55:50,131 --> 00:55:51,252
Something I'm good at?

815
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:55,158
What are you talking about?

816
00:55:56,316 --> 00:55:57,495
You're good at making jokes.

817
00:55:58,614 --> 00:56:02,228
Because I think what I need
the most now is a joke.

818
00:56:06,847 --> 00:56:08,247
You are really pretty now.

819
00:56:11,173 --> 00:56:12,445
You can't see me though.

820
00:56:12,689 --> 00:56:14,007
I saw you earlier.

821
00:56:15,659 --> 00:56:17,094
You are someone who is always pretty.

822
00:56:19,986 --> 00:56:21,336
Don't be serious.

823
00:56:21,567 --> 00:56:22,624
It was a joke.

824
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:32,532
I really missed you.

825
00:56:36,354 --> 00:56:37,719
No matter what I did,

826
00:56:40,346 --> 00:56:41,554
I kept thinking of you.

827
00:56:49,202 --> 00:56:50,595
I tried tiring myself out.

828
00:56:52,062 --> 00:56:53,175
I tried very hard to forget.

829
00:56:55,612 --> 00:56:57,499
I drank and did everything I could.

830
00:57:01,041 --> 00:57:02,724
Even then, I still missed you.

831
00:57:13,276 --> 00:57:15,029
Was this something
you never thought you'd hear?

832
00:57:18,759 --> 00:57:20,218
Then you should think on it.

833
00:57:21,684 --> 00:57:23,086
This time, I'm being serious.

834
00:58:09,311 --> 00:58:12,252
"Descendants of the Sun"

835
00:58:12,779 --> 00:58:14,139
Do you always...

836
00:58:14,918 --> 00:58:16,705
...need to risk your life doing something?

837
00:58:16,789 --> 00:58:18,362
I'm a man who is good at his work.

838
00:58:19,248 --> 00:58:22,365
And my work includes me not dying.

839
00:58:22,577 --> 00:58:23,971
How is everything inside?

840
00:58:24,056 --> 00:58:25,158
I won't be surprised if
it collapsed any time soon.

841
00:58:25,243 --> 00:58:27,785
It's an aftershock! Get out quickly!

842
00:58:28,309 --> 00:58:30,325
Sorry. I am sorry.

843
00:58:30,409 --> 00:58:33,000
What's that noise?
Check the power plant immediately!

844
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:34,906
What's happened to your hand?

845
00:58:35,384 --> 00:58:38,143
Big Boss, Big Boss, do you copy?!

846
00:58:39,309 --> 00:58:41,053
I'm getting ready to run
whenever I need to.

847
00:58:41,533 --> 00:58:42,712
I can't fall down here.

848
00:58:42,797 --> 00:58:44,219
Is there anyone out there?

849
00:58:44,789 --> 00:58:47,132
There is a dead person here.
