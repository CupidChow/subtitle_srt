1
00:00:01,702 --> 00:00:02,603
Is something...

2
00:00:03,604 --> 00:00:04,771
...wrong, Sir?

3
00:00:07,626 --> 00:00:09,226
It's something bad.

4
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,745
Let me use your last card.

5
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,816
I need a chopper.

6
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,585
And...

7
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,456
have a date again.

8
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:52,986
"Episode 12"

9
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,562
I am okay now.

10
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,614
The medicine treatment is working.

11
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:22,816
That's a relief.

12
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,939
But why are you wearing these clothes?

13
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:31,925
Are you going somewhere?

14
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:37,931
Right now, we have completely lost
contact with Dr. Kang and Big Boss.

15
00:01:38,716 --> 00:01:42,235
Dr. Kang who can't be
reached is kidnapped,

16
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:45,305
and the big boss who doesn't take calls...

17
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,709
...seems to have started
a one-man operation.

18
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:53,780
-Then now...
-You said my gift was on the way...

19
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:56,583
Can I open that gift now?

20
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:32,919
Hold onto them.

21
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:36,523
If you lose it, you know that I have
to pay to get another one, right?

22
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:44,598
You know you must come back, right?

23
00:02:50,665 --> 00:02:54,173
Right now, we'll begin
a black ops mission.

24
00:02:54,276 --> 00:02:57,294
We expect an armed clash
with armed guards,

25
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:59,396
and there is no backup other than us.

26
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:01,915
This is an out of uniform mission,

27
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:04,017
and we may not come back alive.

28
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:06,219
If you don't want to take
part, you are excused.

29
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:08,455
Any questions?

30
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:09,856
No, sir.

31
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:11,758
Good.

32
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:13,760
The break is over.

33
00:03:14,999 --> 00:03:16,596
From this moment on,

34
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,336
everyone is back on the Alpha Team.

35
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,539
"Transfer..."

36
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:08,475
The deal with North Urk is done.

37
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:10,093
They transferred all the money.

38
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,666
Bye bye.

39
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:23,081
We're in the money. We're
in the... Right now.

40
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,991
We're in the money.

41
00:05:38,117 --> 00:05:39,339
What should we do with kids?

42
00:05:39,426 --> 00:05:41,741
Shoot everything that doesn't
fit in the suitcase.

43
00:05:44,162 --> 00:05:46,580
Take care of the kids.

44
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,881
Yes, sir.

45
00:05:52,696 --> 00:05:54,230
Go! Go! Go! Go!

46
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:58,124
Go, kids! Run! Go! Go!

47
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,251
Drop your gun!

48
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:27,337
What are you doing here?

49
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:30,423
Then, what are you doing standing
here with your hands up?

50
00:06:31,214 --> 00:06:32,826
I got a little nervous
thinking I was all alone,

51
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,529
but then I welcomed you
with my arms open.

52
00:06:36,802 --> 00:06:38,098
No need to be nervous.

53
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:40,800
All of the Alpha Team members
have returned from their break.

54
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,906
I will thank everyone
properly once we get back.

55
00:06:47,089 --> 00:06:51,011
Captain Big Boss will now give the
Alpha Team the operational order.

56
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:56,216
Piccolo, Harry Potter,
keep the children safe,

57
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:59,436
-and take them out of here quickly.
-Yes, Sir.

58
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,657
Wolf and Snoopy will be on
a hostage rescue mission...

59
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:05,754
...with me.

60
00:07:05,841 --> 00:07:07,610
-Yes, Sir.
-Yes, Sir.

61
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:09,896
What?

62
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:12,599
Who started what mission?

63
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:16,903
At 20:20 our time, the Republic
of Korea's special forces team,

64
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:20,740
-on an unofficial black ops mission...
-Lieutenant General Yoon!

65
00:07:21,005 --> 00:07:23,009
With whose permission...

66
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:25,728
This is driving me nuts...

67
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:30,417
The US Army has promised to rescue
the hostage within 24 hours.

68
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,820
The Korean army went to
rescue a Korean national.

69
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,722
I don't believe there's any
reason for incomprehension.

70
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:39,225
This isn't just a simple
hostage situation.

71
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:42,629
What if our military gets wrongly
involved and ruins the CIA operation?

72
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:44,931
Who will be responsible for that?

73
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:47,659
I am fully aware of diplomatic stance...

74
00:07:47,731 --> 00:07:49,836
Stop interrupting me.

75
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,740
This is a national security
matter that needs to be...

76
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,092
...delicately handled in a
political and diplomatic way.

77
00:07:56,372 --> 00:07:59,646
So let's just leave the hostage
rescue operation to the US army,

78
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:03,750
while we maintain our security
and control the press...

79
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,353
Hey! You politician over there.

80
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,692
What did you just say earlier?

81
00:08:14,115 --> 00:08:15,996
I heard it wrong, right?

82
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:19,499
If you heard it wrong,
listen carefully again.

83
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,936
To you people, maybe national security...

84
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,338
...means governing from a secret room and,

85
00:08:25,425 --> 00:08:28,141
spewing out diplomacy nonsense
in front of cameras,

86
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:32,729
but to my subordinates, it's a country
they protect while dedicating their youth,

87
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:36,182
and duty and order they carry out while
putting their lives on the line!

88
00:08:36,994 --> 00:08:38,502
The reason they answer the
call of the country that...

89
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:40,086
...doesn't even recognize
their name or honor them...

90
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:45,492
...while they get captured or killed
during a mission is because,

91
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:50,413
they firmly believe that one Korean's
life is the national security itself.

92
00:08:53,195 --> 00:08:56,503
As the Commander, I will take full
responsibility from this moment on,

93
00:08:57,003 --> 00:09:00,206
so you carefully pick out a tie to wear,

94
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,376
gather up the reporters and
engage in politics elegantly!

95
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:05,979
Seriously.

96
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,882
You taking the responsibility means...

97
00:09:10,027 --> 00:09:13,253
...you can take off your uniform, right?

98
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:18,224
If it's honorable, anytime.

99
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,288
Ms. Yehwa prepared this medicine.

100
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:31,204
She said it will help you recover.

101
00:09:31,962 --> 00:09:33,473
You'll drink it in one shot.

102
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,781
I made a few people worry?

103
00:09:47,945 --> 00:09:52,392
Although this is not something to
discuss with someone who nearly died...

104
00:09:54,222 --> 00:09:56,429
Did something really happen
to Team Leader Kang?

105
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,247
Did you not hear anything
from Sergeant Seo?

106
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,444
Was Dr. Kang really kidnapped?

107
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:03,536
Did Captain Yoo and them
go to rescue Dr. Kang?

108
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,221
Please do not worry.

109
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:07,707
He will definitely rescue her...

110
00:10:08,637 --> 00:10:09,943
...in one way or another.

111
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,046
What way?

112
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,049
You will not want to know.

113
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,635
Time's up.

114
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:41,040
Let's see if your boyfriend
kept his promise.

115
00:10:41,376 --> 00:10:42,876
Let's get you dressed up.

116
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:44,861
And let's go.

117
00:10:58,942 --> 00:11:01,761
I think he is still inside the building.
Let's move quickly.

118
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,964
Start the mission.

119
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:22,248
I have a secret retreat route.

120
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:23,650
Like you asked.

121
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,985
I only asked for a retreat route,

122
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:28,788
but, kindly, a guide came with it.

123
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:33,159
I kept my word.

124
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,528
So... should you.

125
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,364
Let the hostage go.

126
00:11:52,121 --> 00:11:53,446
Did you hit her?

127
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,317
All snipers on standby.

128
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,052
Wolf transmitting.

129
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:01,036
I got his location.

130
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:10,463
Hold. Hold! All marksman hold your fire!

131
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:13,633
Snoopy...

132
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:18,354
Do you recognize the bomb
type attached to the hostage?

133
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:21,741
From the looks of it, it's
a common time bomb vest.

134
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:24,706
But the detonator in his hand; as soon
as he let's it go, the bomb will go off.

135
00:12:24,825 --> 00:12:26,333
How about just cutting of his wrist...

136
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,313
Please hold!

137
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:30,316
If you shoot the target,
the vest will explode.

138
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,605
Is there no other way?

139
00:12:31,693 --> 00:12:33,102
I will go over there right now.

140
00:12:54,591 --> 00:12:56,809
Quit playing around and
let the helicopter land.

141
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:59,912
Let her go first, or else...

142
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,714
...you do not land.

143
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:06,252
I have to be in a safe
area first, or else...

144
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:13,876
...she dies.

145
00:13:17,678 --> 00:13:19,966
There should be a wireless transmitter
connected to the detonator.

146
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:21,467
So, please buy more time.

147
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,370
What are they saying, Doctor?

148
00:13:26,721 --> 00:13:30,226
About the weather, such a
beautiful day they say.

149
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:31,736
You wanna die?

150
00:13:34,411 --> 00:13:35,815
Are you crazy?

151
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:38,985
I guess you can say that.

152
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:40,186
So...

153
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:42,321
Don't scare her.

154
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,690
Don't touch her.

155
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,507
Don't talk to her.

156
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:50,229
It's only me you should deal with.

157
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:53,533
Take me instead.

158
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:56,466
No, thank you.

159
00:14:00,481 --> 00:14:03,976
It's much more fun, traveling
with a beautiful lady.

160
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,379
Look on her left shoulder.

161
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,148
Faint green light on the
shoulder to the right.

162
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:10,950
I am sure.

163
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,380
I'm sorry for being late.

164
00:14:26,842 --> 00:14:28,134
Don't move.

165
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:29,836
Just stay where you are.

166
00:14:32,198 --> 00:14:33,204
You believe me, right.

167
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:37,894
Be sure not to move.

168
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:43,750
What are you doing?

169
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:45,918
Take aim.

170
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:31,497
How long will it take?

171
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,216
I only need a minute. I can
disarm it in one minute.

172
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,902
Please do not move.

173
00:15:36,325 --> 00:15:37,837
It's not that I'm moving.

174
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,822
I'm trying not to move, but...

175
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:40,840
Look at me.

176
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,332
Look at my eyes.

177
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:49,215
Do you remember when I pulled a
prank on you with the landmine?

178
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:53,119
You told me bring a professional then.

179
00:15:54,171 --> 00:15:56,789
I've been in the military for 15
years, including military academy,

180
00:15:57,371 --> 00:15:59,874
and I've never seen a bomb that
Sergeant Choi could not disarm.

181
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,595
He is the best in our army.

182
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:06,499
So don't worry.

183
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:09,669
You definitely won't die.

184
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:12,672
But still...

185
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,541
There's only 30 seconds left.

186
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:17,977
In case I die, go somewhere
far away, hurry!

187
00:16:18,888 --> 00:16:21,214
You have no idea what we
can do in 30 seconds.

188
00:16:24,495 --> 00:16:25,518
I am done.

189
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:26,619
I will take it off of her.

190
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:27,620
See.

191
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:32,895
We've successfully removed the vest,
but I wasn't able to disarm it.

192
00:16:33,006 --> 00:16:34,093
It's going to explode.

193
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:35,995
Please cover!

194
00:16:45,727 --> 00:16:47,228
Big Boss, to your left!

195
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:18,337
Forget about this.

196
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:09,989
Call from Korea, Captain.

197
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,391
Salute.

198
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:14,776
Captain Yoo Shijin.

199
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:17,697
Mission completed. I'm on my way back.

200
00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:20,333
The target has been shot,

201
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:22,635
and the hostage is safe.

202
00:18:25,629 --> 00:18:27,815
I will disconnect the
radio and be on standby.

203
00:18:28,837 --> 00:18:32,044
I will accept any necessary
disciplinary action​.

204
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,114
You worked hard to
carry out the mission.

205
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:38,217
There won't be a reward
for your efforts but,

206
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,119
there won't be any
disciplinary action either.

207
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:43,055
-That will be your reward.
-Commander Yoon!

208
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:45,758
Don't think about anything and
stay comfortably, that is all.

209
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,529
What a real screwed up unit.

210
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:57,753
Can we put it in the minutes that this
mission was ordered by you, Commander?

211
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,239
I am pleading for that.

212
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,644
Some problems will arise,

213
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:07,913
but thanks for your responsibility,
it'll get resolved very easily.

214
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:11,017
The Blue House has been
briefed on this matter,

215
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:13,819
Let's decide on the level of
discipline under diplomatic rapport...

216
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:17,724
The President is here.

217
00:19:17,812 --> 00:19:19,018
-Right now?
-Yes.

218
00:19:19,105 --> 00:19:20,242
-Here?
-Yes.

219
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:27,266
I saw the report and came over.

220
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:28,567
Please sit.

221
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,772
I heard the hostage is now safe.

222
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:36,609
Yes, but the CIA...

223
00:19:36,684 --> 00:19:40,688
...is strongly protesting the solo
mission that was carried out.

224
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:44,650
We have been put in an awkward
diplomatic situation.

225
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:47,019
This will be a burden to the
trade negotiations as well.

226
00:19:47,901 --> 00:19:50,489
Before this becomes a burden
on an administrative level,

227
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:55,294
you must strongly penalize the person
who gave out the order for the mission.

228
00:19:57,173 --> 00:19:58,297
Is that how it is?

229
00:20:01,078 --> 00:20:04,203
I am Special Forces
Commander Yoon Giljoon.

230
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:06,772
I think the same.

231
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,876
I will take all of the responsibility.

232
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,678
I think differently.

233
00:20:14,069 --> 00:20:19,057
What kind of responsibility will you take
for a successful hostage rescue mission?

234
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:21,954
The hostage is safe,

235
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:24,372
and the problem is about
politics and diplomacy.

236
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:25,844
Then...

237
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,426
That's my responsibility.

238
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:30,362
I will take all of the responsibility.

239
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,998
However, President...

240
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:35,408
Please investigate and report
any expected issues...

241
00:20:35,487 --> 00:20:37,569
...from the foreign security affairs team.

242
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:47,162
Thank you for saving our citizen.

243
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:53,402
And thank you for making everyone
return without a single one hurt.

244
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,476
This is my first time
seeing a gun wound.

245
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:47,082
Coming out to this wide world, I
sure am seeing all kinds of things.

246
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:49,341
I think you'll need few stitches.

247
00:22:49,437 --> 00:22:50,536
Right.

248
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,722
Bite on this first, and you
get a bottle of Vodka.

249
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:56,525
Your homeland will
remember your sacrifice.

250
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,445
Why?

251
00:22:59,761 --> 00:23:01,981
Originally, this is how a
gun wound is taken care of.

252
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:03,172
Haven't you watched any movies?

253
00:23:03,275 --> 00:23:06,989
In a horror movie, you know that
noisy doctors like you die first?

254
00:23:07,204 --> 00:23:08,420
You bite the pen.

255
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:16,428
You've worked hard.

256
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,298
I was worried about you.

257
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:21,606
What do I do?

258
00:23:21,697 --> 00:23:23,702
-Make her bite on to it first.
-Hey!

259
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:33,195
One! Two! Three! Four!

260
00:23:33,736 --> 00:23:36,415
One, two, three, four.

261
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:39,718
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

262
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:43,621
While moving, you will sing!
The song is "A cool man!"

263
00:23:43,718 --> 00:23:45,324
-There are!
-There are!

264
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,792
-many!
-many!

265
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:49,628
Cool men!

266
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:56,936
He's so tall!

267
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:58,671
Sergeant Major Seo!

268
00:24:00,391 --> 00:24:01,874
See me for a bit.

269
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:06,078
Yes.

270
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:11,633
I am saying this after watching
and hearing it over and over,

271
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:16,889
Why do you have to do those obscene things
everyday? It's so harmful, seriously!

272
00:24:23,996 --> 00:24:25,097
Ah, Sergeant Major Seo.

273
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,700
Sergeant Seo!

274
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,722
How's your wound?

275
00:24:58,397 --> 00:25:00,799
I couldn't ask you this yesterday
because I wasn't thinking straight.

276
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,216
How is Fatima?

277
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:04,003
She's okay.

278
00:25:05,248 --> 00:25:07,439
She's being treated at
headquarter's emergency center.

279
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,442
Fortunately,
they say she is good.

280
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:12,945
Is it true?

281
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:15,063
What do you mean?

282
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,850
You seem to lie to me often.

283
00:25:21,153 --> 00:25:23,956
You told me, they brought the
Ghost Village kids to a safe place.

284
00:25:25,157 --> 00:25:27,760
But those children were there.

285
00:25:31,764 --> 00:25:33,866
I'm sorry for lying.

286
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:37,369
I did it in case you were worried.

287
00:25:39,071 --> 00:25:41,673
So what other lies did you say,

288
00:25:42,975 --> 00:25:44,792
just in case I got worried?

289
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:50,516
How did you get this?

290
00:25:51,817 --> 00:25:53,318
While shoveling at the unit.

291
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:55,921
Are you okay? Did anyone get hurt?

292
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:57,990
It was a simply a car accident.

293
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,792
Everyone must have been taken back.
Are they okay?

294
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:01,593
Can I ask what happened?

295
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:04,196
Something came up for me
to go to Headquarters.

296
00:26:05,831 --> 00:26:07,533
There are...

297
00:26:10,536 --> 00:26:11,737
...no other lies.

298
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,741
Liar.

299
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:23,749
What is behind the
lies you just told me?

300
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:28,420
I understand now.

301
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:31,406
The lies you tell,

302
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:37,512
are not lies that I can challenge, fight
about lying, or whine about breaking up.

303
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:41,133
Behind the lies you tell,

304
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,735
someone's life depends on it,

305
00:26:44,278 --> 00:26:48,273
politics and diplomacy get involved,
and the country take actions about it.

306
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:50,976
And your jokes were made...

307
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:55,747
...to hide those unspeakable things.

308
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,329
In the future,

309
00:26:59,424 --> 00:27:02,821
you will continue to try hard to joke in
order to hide those unspeakable things,

310
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:04,523
and I won't be able to believe them.

311
00:27:05,003 --> 00:27:06,725
In the end...

312
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:09,795
There won't be anything left
to talk about with each other.

313
00:27:14,254 --> 00:27:15,357
For me, I just want to talk about,

314
00:27:15,746 --> 00:27:20,272
how I got mad in the morning because
of someone's crappy parking job,

315
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:24,643
how I wavered between eating kimchi
stew or bean paste stew for lunch,

316
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,447
or how I got frustrated because I
didn't get my delivery on time.

317
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:32,918
I just want to talk about
those little things...

318
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:37,222
Then talk about it.

319
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,027
Every word from you is important to me.

320
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,031
I know.

321
00:27:48,032 --> 00:27:49,268
I believe you...

322
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:51,737
I do, but...

323
00:27:55,087 --> 00:27:57,376
I can not say those things to a person...

324
00:27:59,578 --> 00:28:01,280
...who blocks a bullet with his body.

325
00:28:10,815 --> 00:28:12,724
Do you want to break up with me?

326
00:28:20,394 --> 00:28:23,001
I'm considering whether...

327
00:28:25,304 --> 00:28:26,705
...you're a man I can handle.

328
00:28:35,803 --> 00:28:37,115
Big Boss.

329
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:38,983
He's smart,

330
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:40,886
funny,

331
00:28:41,587 --> 00:28:43,188
and mysterious,

332
00:28:44,704 --> 00:28:45,537
but...

333
00:28:46,331 --> 00:28:48,827
...he has a lot of secrets.

334
00:28:52,249 --> 00:28:54,433
He'll disappear from time to time,

335
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:56,535
will be hard to contact.

336
00:28:58,036 --> 00:28:59,438
And then one day,

337
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,512
he'll never come back.

338
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:20,592
"Name: David Argus"

339
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:26,231
Received the gift, Big Boss.

340
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:28,734
Thanks to you,

341
00:29:28,834 --> 00:29:32,237
over 200 people have to write
thousands of pages of reports,

342
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:33,372
again.

343
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,843
Now, I realized what I had just did.

344
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:40,126
My apology.

345
00:29:40,212 --> 00:29:43,131
It's a good day when the failed
operation results only in paper work,

346
00:29:43,226 --> 00:29:44,716
instead of our lives lost.

347
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,052
You don't have to apologize to anyone.

348
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:50,355
Thanks for not reporting on that day.

349
00:29:50,756 --> 00:29:51,957
Because of you,

350
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:56,224
I was able to avoid
struggles with my own troops.

351
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:58,630
No, I reported you.

352
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,700
Just a little bit late.

353
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:09,107
Seems very lonely, with no honor.

354
00:30:09,631 --> 00:30:11,443
And no country to serve.

355
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:16,031
See you again.

356
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,484
Big Boss!

357
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:25,006
Even if I never see you again,

358
00:30:25,535 --> 00:30:26,825
you stay alive.

359
00:30:27,526 --> 00:30:28,827
You stay well.

360
00:30:39,055 --> 00:30:42,453
The patients will leave on Wednesday,
two days before the medical team.

361
00:30:42,556 --> 00:30:44,443
We will be taking the
Friday night flight.

362
00:30:44,543 --> 00:30:47,546
So, the Haesung Hospital Volunteer team...

363
00:30:47,647 --> 00:30:50,449
...will officially disbands on Thursday.

364
00:30:51,932 --> 00:30:53,952
We're really going.

365
00:30:54,035 --> 00:30:56,154
Say it honestly. Are
we fired or disbanded?

366
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:57,856
Why? Are you sad?

367
00:30:57,956 --> 00:30:59,758
You were the one who
wanted to go so badly.

368
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,627
That's right, I'm not
super excited about this.

369
00:31:02,719 --> 00:31:03,729
Am I the only one?

370
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:05,630
Me too.

371
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:08,223
I feel weird.

372
00:31:09,564 --> 00:31:10,535
Me too.

373
00:31:10,754 --> 00:31:11,536
Well...

374
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,658
Then, shall we go?

375
00:31:17,142 --> 00:31:19,561
This is our last round in Urk.

376
00:31:31,651 --> 00:31:33,859
Lieutenant Yoon, you are indeed a soldier.

377
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:35,443
Why are you recovering so fast?

378
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,862
Why are you asking why?

379
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:38,335
It's because I'm young.

380
00:31:39,573 --> 00:31:41,366
Seeing you're already picking
a fight, you're recovered.

381
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:44,569
After two days of being stable,
you can be discharged.

382
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,329
I understand. So please stand still.

383
00:31:49,424 --> 00:31:51,243
Who is treating whom right now?

384
00:31:52,225 --> 00:31:53,445
What are you doing?

385
00:31:53,924 --> 00:31:55,347
You are taking your medicine well, right?

386
00:31:55,844 --> 00:31:57,945
Make sure it doesn't get infected.

387
00:31:58,033 --> 00:31:59,851
You can shower after two days.

388
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,454
You can be discharged.

389
00:32:07,856 --> 00:32:11,696
Starting tomorrow, please prepare porridge
for his meals and adjust his antibiotics.

390
00:32:12,998 --> 00:32:15,100
You have passed the critical stage.

391
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,203
But because of you,
many people almost died.

392
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:21,573
You will be summoned in South Korea,

393
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:23,642
so I hope you get the
punishment you deserve.

394
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,243
Diamonds...

395
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:27,895
My diamonds...

396
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,816
Your diamonds have been
turned over to the US.

397
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:32,317
You won't be able to find them forever.

398
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:35,220
I'm letting you know,
so that you could suffer.

399
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,698
You're not uncomfortable
anywhere, right?

400
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:50,502
You're the healthiest patient
who will return to Korea.

401
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:53,755
If I go back to Korea, it's cold right?

402
00:32:55,207 --> 00:32:56,808
I don't like the cold...

403
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:59,010
Doctor, doctor!

404
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:00,412
Doctor!

405
00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:02,414
This fax came.

406
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:04,716
It says something about Dr.
Lee Chihoon.

407
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,122
The results must be back.

408
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:07,118
Wait!

409
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,622
Can you give it to me?

410
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:18,930
You...

411
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,634
-...can't come in here.
-We're all returning to Korea.

412
00:33:22,812 --> 00:33:24,503
Doctors and patients, everyone.

413
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:27,405
Good for you,
you won't be seeing me anymore.

414
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,881
I didn't get it.

415
00:33:37,657 --> 00:33:39,851
I didn't get it! I'm not dying!

416
00:33:40,252 --> 00:33:41,669
You like that you're not dying?

417
00:33:51,026 --> 00:33:52,130
Me too.

418
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:57,335
I like it too! That you're not dying!

419
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,325
-Thank you.
-Don't say thank you.

420
00:34:04,393 --> 00:34:07,078
You don't have to say sorry.
Because I won't either.

421
00:34:33,189 --> 00:34:34,406
Ah, you scared me!

422
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:38,593
When did you come?

423
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:41,196
Did you walk here again?

424
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,650
You're all healed.

425
00:34:46,351 --> 00:34:48,653
I am not sick anymore.
I'm all better.

426
00:34:50,015 --> 00:34:52,724
Ah, wait here for a bit!
I will give you something.

427
00:34:54,428 --> 00:34:55,927
Ta-da!

428
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:57,929
When you grow big, wear it.

429
00:34:58,097 --> 00:34:58,998
I'm giving it to you.

430
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,616
And, when you need money, sell it.

431
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,103
You know there are less than 50
pairs of these in the world.

432
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,871
Not this.

433
00:35:07,085 --> 00:35:09,299
-A goat.
-I know, kid!

434
00:35:09,387 --> 00:35:11,776
I will miss you too. But...

435
00:35:12,005 --> 00:35:13,895
Bleki is the name of the village.

436
00:35:14,012 --> 00:35:16,715
-What is your real name?
-Buy me a goat.

437
00:35:16,815 --> 00:35:20,051
Not this. I want to raise a goat.

438
00:35:20,185 --> 00:35:22,587
Oh, Chwadi!

439
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:26,891
-That is your name.
-Yes, goat.

440
00:35:27,168 --> 00:35:29,260
Buy me a goat.

441
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:32,364
-I want to raise a goat.
-Okay.

442
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:36,267
I know how you feel.
I'm also happy that I met you, kid!

443
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:40,171
I will miss you a lot.

444
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:46,077
Fool, don't think about repaying me.

445
00:35:47,869 --> 00:35:49,180
Just think for yourself.

446
00:35:49,848 --> 00:35:50,787
Okay?

447
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,841
Do you want to break up with me?

448
00:36:38,514 --> 00:36:41,315
Alright on to the next one
boys, let's go!

449
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:42,600
Captain!

450
00:36:43,456 --> 00:36:47,439
-Let's take one together.
-You want another one? You and I? Alright.

451
00:36:48,338 --> 00:36:49,541
Ready.

452
00:36:49,641 --> 00:36:52,444
One, two three...

453
00:38:05,694 --> 00:38:07,118
You too...

454
00:38:08,817 --> 00:38:10,221
...should forget this.

455
00:38:53,082 --> 00:38:55,800
Do you want to have some coffee with me?

456
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:00,705
Please make the coffee, Captain.

457
00:39:01,429 --> 00:39:02,740
I'll be at the cloisters.

458
00:40:02,907 --> 00:40:06,304
Before you arrived, I made two
rounds at the Medicube.

459
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:12,243
I was happy for lieutenant
Yoon's fast recovery.

460
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:16,948
But when I was going to tie my hair,
there was no hair tie available.

461
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:20,268
Even though I searched all over
the place, I couldn't find any.

462
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:24,455
Naturally, hair ties are just supplies.

463
00:40:32,659 --> 00:40:34,165
Starting from now on,

464
00:40:35,056 --> 00:40:37,769
I am going to tell you all
the trivial matters too.

465
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:42,273
What I mean is, I will try my best
to deal with the way you are.

466
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,876
So you should also...

467
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:48,246
...try your best to
deal with my chattiness.

468
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:54,435
But please promise me
one thing in return.

469
00:40:57,655 --> 00:40:59,958
Please give me the right
to feel anxious.

470
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:05,296
All those times that you
won't be in front of me...

471
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:07,699
...can't always be a constant
insecurity or worry.

472
00:41:08,567 --> 00:41:09,867
So...

473
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,871
...when you're going to be doing
something really dangerous,

474
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,273
let me know.

475
00:41:16,541 --> 00:41:17,742
For example,

476
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,445
if you tell me that you're
going to the department store,

477
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:24,465
then I will understand that you're
going on a difficult mission.

478
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:29,053
When you're going to be in
a life or death situation,

479
00:41:29,748 --> 00:41:32,757
at least,
don't make jokes and be oblivious.

480
00:41:40,721 --> 00:41:42,033
Then,

481
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:44,652
I will ask you one last question.

482
00:41:47,595 --> 00:41:49,440
Is it me or the country?

483
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:54,912
You need to answer wisely because
this will be the only time I'll ask.

484
00:41:56,814 --> 00:41:58,216
For now it will be Kang Moyeon.

485
00:41:59,217 --> 00:42:00,418
For now?

486
00:42:01,012 --> 00:42:03,121
You said that you will
only ask me this once?

487
00:42:03,314 --> 00:42:05,923
But that was before hearing,
"It's Kang Moyeon for now."

488
00:42:06,391 --> 00:42:07,820
What are you gonna do
if I ask you twice?

489
00:42:07,907 --> 00:42:09,427
It will still be Kang Moyeon.

490
00:42:10,595 --> 00:42:11,712
Really?

491
00:42:13,765 --> 00:42:14,966
What about the country?

492
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,269
The country doesn't get jealous.

493
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:19,871
It just trusts me.

494
00:42:20,772 --> 00:42:23,408
Why do I have to be
in this kind of love?

495
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,811
Who treats the country like mother-in-law
and the nation like sister-in-law?

496
00:42:38,153 --> 00:42:41,059
There won't be anything that you
would have to worry about, Dr.Kang.

497
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,162
I will promise you that.

498
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,101
I don't know.

499
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,239
You are so cute.

500
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,258
That one, I know.

501
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:17,578
I am fine now.

502
00:43:17,862 --> 00:43:21,365
The fever has gone down, and
I'm super hungry right now.

503
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:24,585
I want samgyetang.

504
00:43:25,372 --> 00:43:27,688
-Chicken stew with ginseng?
-I also want some pork belly.

505
00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:29,874
Let's go eat them once
we're back in Korea.

506
00:43:30,475 --> 00:43:32,460
-I also want soju and beer.
-Gosh.

507
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:35,196
Since you are craving alcohol, it means
you are feeling completely better.

508
00:43:35,422 --> 00:43:36,914
I am starting to realize,

509
00:43:37,016 --> 00:43:39,299
that all the things that I happen to like
starts with the letter S.

510
00:43:39,717 --> 00:43:42,186
Chicken stew with ginseng, pork belly.

511
00:43:42,587 --> 00:43:43,588
Soju and beer,

512
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:45,205
and Seo Daeyeong.

513
00:43:46,776 --> 00:43:47,692
That's so fascinating.

514
00:43:47,892 --> 00:43:50,461
Even the word 'fascinating'
starts with the letter S.

515
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:51,762
Scam Artist.

516
00:44:09,686 --> 00:44:10,681
I love you.

517
00:44:18,579 --> 00:44:21,592
Ah, seriously, Commander sir.

518
00:44:21,724 --> 00:44:25,127
You put a soy sauce lid inside
of that chicken belly, Sir!

519
00:44:25,232 --> 00:44:26,971
Oh, this wasn't dates?

520
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:29,033
That's not edible!

521
00:44:29,653 --> 00:44:31,135
-Even when you cook it?
-Pardon?

522
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:33,754
You should put this in there too.
When it's cooked, it's very tasty.

523
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:36,153
It's very tasty indeed. You know what
you're talking about, Deputy Commander.

524
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,141
For goodness sake!

525
00:44:37,661 --> 00:44:39,661
Can the two of you stay
out of here, please?

526
00:44:39,757 --> 00:44:43,161
Hey, this is all about the hard-working
hands and sincerity that goes in.

527
00:44:43,248 --> 00:44:45,483
All you have to do is put
this in and boil it right?

528
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:46,583
That's right. That's right.

529
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:48,035
Salt, salt, salt!

530
00:44:48,725 --> 00:44:51,022
Yes! That's right!

531
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,746
There you go.

532
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:01,632
This is so touching.

533
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:03,634
You look really good
in those aprons too.

534
00:45:04,122 --> 00:45:07,822
Well, I am the type that likes
to make promises for the future.

535
00:45:07,939 --> 00:45:11,509
You two have worked so hard so we prepared
this to help regain your strength.

536
00:45:11,609 --> 00:45:12,907
But I don't know if it
will taste any good.

537
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:15,913
This is really delicious! The
seasoning is perfect too!

538
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:18,216
As expected from Private Kim!

539
00:45:18,283 --> 00:45:19,100
Isn't that right?

540
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:21,586
I think I will miss Private Kim's
cooking even when I go back to Korea.

541
00:45:21,686 --> 00:45:23,187
When I was receiving the
commissioned training,

542
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:25,375
I used to go this ginger chicken stew
shop in front of my school quite often.

543
00:45:25,747 --> 00:45:26,757
That's true.

544
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:29,360
I saw you and Min Yoongi eating
samgyetang together at that restaurant.

545
00:45:29,427 --> 00:45:30,928
We didn't go together.

546
00:45:31,028 --> 00:45:33,555
He just followed me because he
said that had something to tell me.

547
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:36,067
I think you're still misunderstanding that
I wedged between your relationship...

548
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,856
You did interrupt. What did he need
to talk to you about anyways?

549
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:40,771
He was just saying that there was
no relationship between you two.

550
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:42,873
Did he say that he had
nothing to do with me?

551
00:45:42,965 --> 00:45:45,267
Yes. He said that you two are
nothing but study partners...

552
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:46,677
Just studying partners?

553
00:45:47,164 --> 00:45:50,047
We weren't just study partners.
We had a thing since April!

554
00:45:50,131 --> 00:45:52,751
He asked me to go eat with him starting
from March when school resumed.

555
00:45:52,854 --> 00:45:55,267
The April that I was talking
about was the year before.

556
00:45:55,354 --> 00:45:58,357
-Wasn't it just one-sided love?
-I said we had a thing going on!

557
00:46:06,238 --> 00:46:09,350
It seems like they were on bad terms with
each other because of this Yoongi guy.

558
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:12,136
I think she won't be able to sleep
because she misses him so much.

559
00:46:12,246 --> 00:46:14,238
-That's a misunderstanding sir.
-That's a misunderstanding indeed.

560
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:16,841
They were making such a
fuss about a picture to us,

561
00:46:16,917 --> 00:46:19,319
and they were having a nice
relationship elsewhere.

562
00:46:19,509 --> 00:46:21,012
I am heated up right now.

563
00:46:21,116 --> 00:46:25,216
I feel like killing whoever this guy
is that was messing with these girls.

564
00:46:28,309 --> 00:46:30,221
He must be a doctor at
a hospital somewhere.

565
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:33,333
We should hold a grasp of this
guy and go do an FEO on him.

566
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:40,798
I don't know if I can
hold it in if I see him.

567
00:46:41,499 --> 00:46:44,402
Shooting will be too accurate,
while explosion will be too boring.

568
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:52,757
What kind team-kill is this?

569
00:46:52,837 --> 00:46:54,939
Who was the one that started talking
about our time as students?

570
00:46:55,046 --> 00:46:57,148
But still, how can you bring Min
Yoongi into this conversation?

571
00:46:57,248 --> 00:46:59,250
Now is not the time to fight about that.

572
00:46:59,344 --> 00:47:01,519
How are we going to clean up this mess?

573
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,739
How did we revealed our past
while eating samgyetang?

574
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:07,425
Don't worry about me.

575
00:47:07,728 --> 00:47:09,226
Worry about yourself.

576
00:47:10,127 --> 00:47:11,139
Why shouldn't I?

577
00:47:11,234 --> 00:47:13,831
All I have to do is pretend
to be really sick.

578
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:15,633
I was brought back to life anyway.

579
00:47:15,733 --> 00:47:17,450
My past wouldn't be such a big deal.

580
00:47:17,685 --> 00:47:19,203
Darn, I envy you.

581
00:47:29,046 --> 00:47:31,649
I am okay, I think I have a
little fever that's all.

582
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:36,087
So hot! I think you'll be worried.
I am really okay, though.

583
00:47:36,184 --> 00:47:37,771
I know, you do look fine to me.

584
00:47:38,391 --> 00:47:40,591
I guess it's because you were thinking
too much about that Yoongi dude,

585
00:47:41,192 --> 00:47:42,793
that your face is glowing so much.

586
00:47:44,295 --> 00:47:45,496
You're not falling for it.

587
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:48,415
Well, I have something
to discuss with you.

588
00:47:50,791 --> 00:47:51,669
With me?

589
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:56,674
So, you had a thing going on with Yoongi
but only a discussion with me?

590
00:47:57,074 --> 00:47:58,976
Can't I?
-You thought I would allow that?

591
00:47:59,176 --> 00:48:03,447
Fine then. Speaking of Yoongi, I should
give him a call so I can hear his voice.

592
00:48:04,448 --> 00:48:05,960
Call him. See what happens.

593
00:48:06,047 --> 00:48:07,952
I think I should call him
just out of curiosity.

594
00:48:15,875 --> 00:48:17,794
From now on, listen to what I
have to say very carefully.

595
00:48:18,284 --> 00:48:19,597
What are you going to say?

596
00:48:19,697 --> 00:48:20,898
As of now,

597
00:48:21,205 --> 00:48:25,308
I like Yoo Shijin the most out of
all the men that exist in this world.

598
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:30,273
With him, I've drank tea few times,
fell in water together,

599
00:48:30,374 --> 00:48:32,276
overcame an infectious disease together,

600
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:34,845
and also got bullet wound
from his gunshot.

601
00:48:35,346 --> 00:48:37,248
Despite all of that,

602
00:48:38,032 --> 00:48:40,217
Yoo Shijin is the guy I like so damn much.

603
00:48:40,818 --> 00:48:42,019
It's because...

604
00:48:42,386 --> 00:48:45,388
He is never cowardly,

605
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:48,025
is honorable in every moment I see,

606
00:48:48,192 --> 00:48:50,694
and handsome every time I have seen him.

607
00:48:52,495 --> 00:48:53,697
Any objection?

608
00:48:55,466 --> 00:48:56,500
No, I do not.

609
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:59,303
Then I have something to discuss with you.

610
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,372
Do you want to hear it or not?

611
00:49:04,773 --> 00:49:07,695
Honestly, I wanted to hear everything
you just said ever since I was born.

612
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:12,783
-I am gonna go see Fatima tomorrow.
-Okay.

613
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:17,588
So I was wondering if Daniel and Yehwa
can be Fatima's guardians by chance.

614
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:21,959
Those two people always show up
and then disappear suddenly.

615
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,162
Instead of them, there is...

616
00:49:26,358 --> 00:49:27,932
...just one person you can trust.

617
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:30,534
Although you might be displeased.

618
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:31,460
A guardian?

619
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:35,172
Do you remember when I asked
you about the black market?

620
00:49:36,312 --> 00:49:37,897
The kid is there.

621
00:49:38,509 --> 00:49:39,810
You saved her.

622
00:49:46,684 --> 00:49:50,120
-Wow, look at her.
-Why did you choose me for a guardian?

623
00:49:53,368 --> 00:49:56,377
I trust the ones who bring me luck.

624
00:49:57,962 --> 00:50:00,981
Okay. But I heard you're
heading back to Korea.

625
00:50:01,065 --> 00:50:01,932
Yeah.

626
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:05,336
Thanks for everything, Valentine.

627
00:50:06,537 --> 00:50:07,721
Good luck to you.

628
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:09,139
Thank you.

629
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:12,943
You need to listen to her.

630
00:50:13,971 --> 00:50:15,900
She is not as nice as me.

631
00:50:15,967 --> 00:50:20,449
And write me letters to the
address that I gave you.

632
00:50:20,552 --> 00:50:21,952
No.

633
00:50:23,166 --> 00:50:24,588
Then just call me.

634
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:26,457
No.

635
00:50:26,657 --> 00:50:28,125
Gosh, seriously.

636
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:31,228
Hey, why do I, who pays money,
have to beg so earnestly?

637
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:34,031
-Is there no solution to your attitude?
-Hey, lady!

638
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:36,233
Be nice.

639
00:50:38,095 --> 00:50:40,571
Thank you for everything. I'll
always be thankful. Stay safe.

640
00:50:43,526 --> 00:50:46,443
Wow, you really have the potential
to be great when you grow up.

641
00:50:48,913 --> 00:50:51,299
I will always wonder how you are doing,

642
00:50:51,415 --> 00:50:53,734
so stay in touch.

643
00:50:53,926 --> 00:50:55,519
Just to let you know,

644
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:58,688
I meant every word that I just said.

645
00:50:58,789 --> 00:50:59,890
I know.

646
00:51:26,221 --> 00:51:28,352
What is the very first thing you want
to do when you go back to Korea?

647
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:33,324
I want to fill the bathtub
with hot water and jump in.

648
00:51:33,624 --> 00:51:34,858
How about you, Captain?

649
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:37,161
I want to watch you doing that.

650
00:51:41,265 --> 00:51:42,466
Let's watch a movie.

651
00:51:42,666 --> 00:51:44,134
The movie we couldn't watch last time.

652
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:48,439
It is really hard to
watch a movie together.

653
00:51:49,651 --> 00:51:50,741
I'd like that.

654
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:54,645
When we go to Korea, let's not do
something like kidnapping or rescuing,

655
00:51:54,745 --> 00:51:56,447
but do everything that other people do.

656
00:51:56,947 --> 00:52:00,451
Watching a movie, dining, drinking
tea and taking me back home.

657
00:52:00,551 --> 00:52:02,353
And filling the bathtub with
water when you get home.

658
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:06,473
Stay there.

659
00:52:07,905 --> 00:52:10,027
Go back first. I will go there soon.

660
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:13,030
Don't go to the hotel with the chairman.

661
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:15,839
Don't cheat on me with Yoongi either.

662
00:52:16,415 --> 00:52:17,933
I told you to stop.

663
00:52:18,014 --> 00:52:19,136
And this...

664
00:52:26,818 --> 00:52:29,813
You are still keeping this with you?

665
00:52:31,415 --> 00:52:34,518
People of Urk believe that if they
take a pebble from this beach,

666
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:37,621
they will be able to come
back no matter what.

667
00:52:40,891 --> 00:52:41,592
Here.

668
00:52:48,131 --> 00:52:50,034
You can try it this time, Dr. Kang.

669
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:52,236
Whether you come back again or not.

670
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:09,153
You've worked hard.

671
00:53:12,306 --> 00:53:13,657
You too, Captain.

672
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:56,133
You woke up early.

673
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,702
Because I don't want to
miss even one second of it.

674
00:53:59,203 --> 00:54:01,405
Stay safe, my pigeons.

675
00:54:04,108 --> 00:54:07,511
Oh, but there is a person
that we haven't seen before.

676
00:54:08,011 --> 00:54:10,948
-Who is it?
-Right? Way in the front.

677
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:13,817
He is quite different.

678
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:20,574
-Wow.
-Oh my gosh.

679
00:54:31,853 --> 00:54:34,071
He used to hate it so much.

680
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:37,040
I guess it is a special event for you.

681
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:40,744
Dr. Song is a really good guy.

682
00:54:44,037 --> 00:54:46,950
Can't you two really go out?

683
00:54:47,317 --> 00:54:50,420
I will go back in first because I
haven't packed everything yet.

684
00:54:51,722 --> 00:54:52,839
What should I do?

685
00:54:53,524 --> 00:54:56,293
I think I made a mistake again.

686
00:54:56,593 --> 00:54:58,095
You didn't do anything wrong.

687
00:54:58,362 --> 00:55:00,898
It's because Nurse Ha is as
good person as Dr. Song.

688
00:55:01,265 --> 00:55:03,383
Like a middle-aged
version of Candy Candy.

689
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,585
What do you mean by that?

690
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:08,071
The kid doesn't have to know.

691
00:55:11,675 --> 00:55:13,076
"Haesung Medicube"

692
00:55:14,285 --> 00:55:16,580
-Let's go now.
-Yes.

693
00:56:21,631 --> 00:56:23,666
One, two, three.

694
00:56:26,352 --> 00:56:27,651
Okay. Attention.

695
00:56:29,587 --> 00:56:30,604
Salute.

696
00:56:42,666 --> 00:56:45,419
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

697
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:48,255
I think it's too far to
get to the workplace.

698
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:51,358
It was nice to step out of my room
to walk straight to Medicube.

699
00:56:51,539 --> 00:56:53,927
And appreciating those
pigeons every morning.

700
00:56:54,027 --> 00:56:55,362
Let's go together.

701
00:56:55,492 --> 00:56:56,596
Hello.

702
00:56:56,980 --> 00:57:00,584
But doesn't today feel like
our first day of work?

703
00:57:00,706 --> 00:57:02,386
I know, right? Me too.

704
00:57:02,486 --> 00:57:06,456
I also feel the same. It is cold.

705
00:57:06,556 --> 00:57:08,158
Good morning.

706
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:11,461
We really are back.

707
00:57:37,854 --> 00:57:40,691
"Descendants of The Sun"

708
00:57:40,845 --> 00:57:42,359
What is all this mess?

709
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:43,961
When did these men came back?

710
00:57:45,062 --> 00:57:47,664
My goodness! Sofa, here!

711
00:57:47,731 --> 00:57:50,067
By chance, are you taking me home?

712
00:57:50,167 --> 00:57:51,568
I really won't send you back home.

713
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:55,672
We will be in charge of the perimeter
on the 17th floor of the building.

714
00:57:55,772 --> 00:57:57,324
How could you do this?

715
00:57:57,441 --> 00:57:59,626
How can you let me know
about it this way?

716
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:02,429
All my runaways equals
a hundred of my words!

717
00:58:02,551 --> 00:58:03,947
Let's stop.

718
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:08,618
What is your identity to have a
shootout in the middle of Seoul?

719
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:11,288
Backup required! Backup required!

720
00:58:11,421 --> 00:58:14,224
I love you, Yoon Myeongju. Very much.
