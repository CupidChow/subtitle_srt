1
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,457
Then let me ask you one thing

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,526
since this might be the last time.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,462
About the time when I kissed
you without your consent.

4
00:00:12,462 --> 00:00:13,730
I told you not to bring
that up until I...

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:14,798
What should I do?

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,606
Should I apologize or should I confess?

7
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,853
You are really amazing.

8
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:42,492
You're amazing, but
you're too dangerous.

9
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,095
And because you're
dangerous, I don't like it.

10
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,966
But every moment our eyes
met has been charming.

11
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,003
I'm going to have to
blow you off this time.

12
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:55,972
You're leaving?

13
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,344
Is something the matter?

14
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,047
-I think I have to go.
-Now?

15
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,515
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:10,187
I can't say the details
because of the rules.

17
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,923
-Was he your colleague?
-He was a comrade in combat.

18
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,926
So that means, Captain Yoo also...

19
00:01:15,926 --> 00:01:17,027
So let's not

20
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:21,598
talk about that.

21
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,838
That's why I wish we had more time.

22
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:33,210
So that I can clear my complicated
thoughts and get rid of those fears.

23
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,012
Although it's dangerous,

24
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,516
should I become this
amazing man's girlfriend?

25
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,152
I need some time to think about it.

26
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,023
But, Yoo Si Jin,

27
00:01:48,225 --> 00:01:50,527
you seem to always leave for somewhere.

28
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,930
Can I even argue why you always do this?

29
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,967
Or can I beg you not to go?

30
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,705
I feel like a fool for
weighing over it alone.

31
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,308
And now I just

32
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,980
resent Yoo Si Jin.

33
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,719
Please apologize. I'll
accept your apology.

34
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,298
I'm sorry. Please stay healthy.

35
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,434
Power of unity.

36
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,759
One, two, three,

37
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:34,670
four! One, two, three, four!

38
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,460
One, two, three, four! A cool... man!

39
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,748
Oh, hello!

40
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,080
Where is Captain Yoo? He
wasn't in captain's office.

41
00:03:56,219 --> 00:03:58,521
He left last night.

42
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,124
He booked a budget airline flight.

43
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,094
The flight back home should
have departed by now.

44
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,263
Power of unity.

45
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,703
So heartless.

46
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:32,703
=Decandents of The Sun=
Episode 6

47
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:38,628
Wow, this photo is still here.

48
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:39,863
Father.

49
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,567
Like your mother said, you should
have been a prosecuting judge.

50
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,804
Who gives recognition to
a soldier these days?

51
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:53,260
If I only had brains, maybe. But
since I was born athletic as well,

52
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:55,111
it would have been a waste
to be a prosecuting judge.

53
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,416
General Yoo, you need to stay
healthy and live a long life.

54
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:03,119
Wait till your son, me, becomes a Colonel
and we can take a picture together.

55
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,357
Who says they'll put stars on someone
like you without any influential support?

56
00:05:08,124 --> 00:05:10,660
What a joke. You haven't
even become a major yet.

57
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,030
Are you okay?

58
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,032
I just did as you taught me.

59
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,134
Please be proud of me.

60
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,536
Being a soldier...

61
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,040
Sometimes being in confinement is
more honorable than promotion.

62
00:05:26,376 --> 00:05:27,143
Well done.

63
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,715
I'm ready. Please come in.

64
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:36,286
Please go in. I'll bring Mother in.

65
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,154
Okay.

66
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,797
Now, I'm taking it.

67
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,300
One, two, three.

68
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:57,040
Trainee number 17, ready to go down.

69
00:05:57,841 --> 00:05:59,342
Going down now.

70
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:09,420
Please save me!

71
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,788
Save me!

72
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,761
Down, up, down, up.

73
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,765
Down, up, get down.

74
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,700
One, two,

75
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,235
up.

76
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:28,110
Your body looks fine, but is
there a problem with your brain?

77
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,039
-No.
-Exchange mission.

78
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,508
Exchange mission.

79
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,560
-Do you want to kill your instructor?
-Yes.

80
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,053
Your body is not capable of it.

81
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,460
I'll give you 30 seconds. Run to guardhouse
and come back. Turn left.

82
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:52,760
If you see me outside, I'll put down
my rank and we can fight anytime.

83
00:06:52,896 --> 00:06:54,998
Let's get stronger today!

84
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,367
Run.

85
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:03,506
Super good looking trainee.

86
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,676
Ready to go down. Going down now.

87
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,851
Put me down.

88
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,891
Oh!

89
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,364
Cut it out, trainee.
Hurry up and come down.

90
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:34,337
Look closely. That is a
A+ airborne posture.

91
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,942
Whoa!

92
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,717
Aren't you on leave?
What are you doing here?

93
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:51,187
What could I do when I missed you?
When are you finished?

94
00:07:51,754 --> 00:07:54,257
Hurry up and finish so
we can have some soju.

95
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,095
Did your father's retirement
ceremony go well?

96
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,731
I thought I was going to die
collecting all the flower bouquets.

97
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,834
It's good to see you healthy.
Power of unity.

98
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,069
Power of unity.

99
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:12,175
Hey, hey. It's been a year
since we got together, right?

100
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:16,846
Let's order soju by the box.
And drink shots by the glass.

101
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:21,684
What do you mean glass? Let's get drunk.

102
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:25,455
-Do you know them?
-I gave them a monster's training before.

103
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,191
It's all right.

104
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,610
Do I look like a soldier?

105
00:08:31,694 --> 00:08:34,410
Anyone can tell you're a soldier.

106
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,164
Oh?

107
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,267
Sergeant First Class Seo?

108
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,237
Isn't this Sergeant First Class Seo?

109
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,606
Looks like the disguise failed.

110
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,142
Do you have a exit plan?

111
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,411
Look towards 5 o'clock.

112
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,449
That's it. It's the monster trainer Seo.

113
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,219
Do you remember me?

114
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:00,723
Didn't you promise us in every training?

115
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:04,627
If we meet outside of class, we
put down our ranks and fight.

116
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,796
If we meet outside,

117
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,933
but this isn't outside. This is inside.

118
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,268
How can I put down my rank?

119
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,706
Really, you guys...

120
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,778
It would be nice to keep such
fond memories in your heart.

121
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,170
Fond memories in my heart?

122
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,051
-Run on the count of three. One...
-Three!

123
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,300
Is there a soccer match
today or something?

124
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,336
Try and guess!

125
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,873
At 2:30. Three!

126
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,976
No, no, this isn't it!

127
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,838
Stop there! Stop right there!

128
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,607
Catch them! Catch them!

129
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,190
That way! That way!

130
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,392
This way, this way! Over there!

131
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,002
You count very strangely. How
does three come after one?

132
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:30,339
It's because I only did sports. The one who
studied should have done the counting.

133
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,630
Gosh, those punks.

134
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,714
I guess the mighty instructor
from hell has his time up too.

135
00:11:39,215 --> 00:11:44,120
Is now the time? I should
give it to you once, too.

136
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,760
Do you remember when I was an army cadet,
what you put me through?

137
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:49,759
I do remember. Shall we go at it now?

138
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,099
I don't remember. I only have
memories of being happy.

139
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,302
That sobered me.

140
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,374
Did you have the wine I left behind?

141
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,243
I did taste it.

142
00:12:07,677 --> 00:12:08,945
Did you drink it alone?

143
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,813
I drank it with Doctor Kang.

144
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,783
Is it going well?

145
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:19,722
It didn't go well. For some reason, I always
feel like I got dumped when I'm on vacation.

146
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:27,764
I still think about it a little
but things will be okay soon.

147
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,334
There's nobody who doesn't
give in after ten tries.

148
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,772
That's coming from someone who hasn't
even tried once out of that ten.

149
00:12:36,773 --> 00:12:41,310
It isn't that I haven't tried.

150
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,248
I think we might be fools.

151
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,918
But I think us being a set
is creating some synergy.

152
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,525
I'll be going now.

153
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,250
Where are you going?

154
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,363
I'm going home. Isn't
this my neighborhood?

155
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:11,090
Did you come this way on purpose?
Is this how you discriminate?

156
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,042
Enjoy your leave. Power of unity.

157
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:20,416
Aren't you even going to offer me some
ramen? When your house is nearby?

158
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,683
Hello? Hello?

159
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,653
Seo Dae Young, did you
just answer my call?

160
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,525
You really answered!

161
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:07,430
Why did you answer? What's wrong?

162
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:14,403
Say something since you answered anyway.

163
00:14:17,807 --> 00:14:22,278
Never mind. Okay, just listen then.

164
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,414
Just don't hang up. Got it?

165
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:34,924
I'm doing fine. And I'm keeping my uniform on.
That's why I haven't been bit by mosquitoes.

166
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:40,663
I'm healthy because of the training.
And I miss you so much.

167
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,504
Did you see Captain Si Jin yet? He
teased me a lot before he left.

168
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,707
Asking what's so great about Seo Dae Young
that I'd chase you all the way here.

169
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:55,444
Saying that everything about my is
pretty, especially that I have no pride.

170
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,449
So what if I don't have any pride?

171
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,420
When Seo Dae Young loves me this much.

172
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:37,853
Are you listening?

173
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:44,093
If you're listening, at least let
me hear you breathing like a human.

174
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:58,820
It's your leave soon, isn't it? Come
quickly, I have a good wine picked out.

175
00:15:58,941 --> 00:16:00,509
I don't drink with women.

176
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:03,913
Find me a man, too. A good one at that.

177
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,984
What about your halfway-around-the-world
destiny? Not so great when you saw him again?

178
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:19,195
No, he was the best.

179
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:25,167
I shouldn't have accepted his apology. I
should have run after him and held on.

180
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,070
I should have held onto
him and confessed.

181
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,510
He probably thinks I'm not worth it

182
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:39,181
since I missed all those chances.

183
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,723
Hey, hey!

184
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,891
There you go.

185
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,213
You can do basic
translations, can't you?

186
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:54,783
If you suck on these, your
stomach will hurt a lot.

187
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,587
Promise me you won't
suck on these anymore.

188
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,122
Got it?

189
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,760
If you suck on these, you'll be shot.

190
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:14,069
You must wash your hands before you eat.

191
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:19,408
If you don't wash your
hands before eating,

192
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,544
you'll be shot.

193
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,688
Why are the children laughing? Are
you translating it strangely?

194
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,724
You have to get through
to them with laughter.

195
00:19:59,882 --> 00:20:03,219
Power of Unity. Where is your
current location Sergeant Seo?

196
00:20:03,652 --> 00:20:06,455
-I am at the unit.
-I came here to Yang Pyung to do some fishing.

197
00:20:07,256 --> 00:20:10,125
Ah, the mountain and the water is good.

198
00:20:10,526 --> 00:20:12,161
There's no other healing camp.

199
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,296
Then, why'd you call?

200
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,533
I'm bored.

201
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,569
Can't you come here?

202
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:25,174
-It's scary to fish at night, too.
-That's right.

203
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,420
Something might happen, Sergeant Seo!

204
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,816
I'm not going to do surgery anymore.

205
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,719
Apparently my surgical skills
can't be counted as experiences.

206
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,256
I'm going to go back
soon and when I go back

207
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,825
I have to go back to where I was

208
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:18,594
so I'm very busy.

209
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,864
Is that right?

210
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:29,571
Here.

211
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:37,079
I thought it would come
quicker for you, Captain.

212
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,852
Check it, if it really comes back.

213
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:47,282
-No way.
-Yes, it's that car.

214
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:50,185
It's a wasteful skill for
someone who's a doctor.

215
00:22:51,153 --> 00:22:53,322
Maybe that's why I like the
hardware store better.

216
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,693
-I heard you're leaving today.
-Yes.

217
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:59,595
I was thankful for many things.

218
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:05,234
It might not cover more than the parts,
but I wanted to at least do this.

219
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:07,035
If you really feel that way,

220
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:11,840
would you rather pay
back at $10 each month?

221
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:17,146
I would like that. I'll
pay back in installment.

222
00:23:17,846 --> 00:23:20,230
Thank you. While living a good life,

223
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,384
if you want to suffer a
little, give me a call.

224
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,989
Volunteering, relief activities,
or something like that...

225
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,858
I think this was enough for my lifetime.

226
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,461
I need to go back to my place.

227
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,931
Are you going to keep
staying here, Daniel?

228
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,501
It seems like I will be for this year.

229
00:23:39,935 --> 00:23:43,105
But who knows? This job doesn't
let me stay put for long.

230
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,873
Go back safely.

231
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:49,545
Be healthy. Send my
regards to Ye Hwa, too.

232
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,146
Everyone's waiting for you,
but what are you doing?

233
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:28,116
-It's going to end in five minutes.
-Why didn't you start five minutes earlier?

234
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:33,050
HepatAmine, Huriamin...

235
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,624
I feel like I won't see you again, so
can I ask you something?

236
00:24:35,624 --> 00:24:36,658
You can't.

237
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,595
Where's the box of IVs...

238
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:41,597
Do you like Si Jin Sunbae?

239
00:24:46,668 --> 00:24:49,771
What an obvious answer. Very well, then.

240
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,141
What did you hear? I
didn't say anything.

241
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:56,178
You did. With your whole body.

242
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,946
Wait a second.

243
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,551
It's Si Jin Sunbae.

244
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,153
You called well.

245
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,540
Kang Mo Yeon-si, Kang Mo Yeon-nim,
Kang Mo Yeon-yang.

246
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:11,326
Our ranking hasn't been settled,
so I'm not sure what to call her.

247
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,729
Does this doctor like you?

248
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,898
Hey, Yoon Myung Ju!

249
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:23,338
You're not giving me your name and rank
even though I'm the one who's calling?

250
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:26,942
Why'd you call? Are you
my sunbae or boss?

251
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:31,046
Right now, a neighborhood brother. I'm
drinking coffee with Sergeant Seo.

252
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:35,250
For me, latte. Him, espresso.

253
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,787
I don't know if he knows
what he's drinking.

254
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:43,425
He knows. I taught him.

255
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,731
-But what were you talking about earlier?
-Just...

256
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:51,733
In an attempt to embarrass her.

257
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:55,337
I am in middle of psychological warfare
with an acquaintance named Kang Mo Yeon.

258
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,939
An acquaintance?

259
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,609
Why are you bothering a civilian?

260
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,245
So you've changed the subject.

261
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,447
Aren't you curious about my
acquaintance's reaction?

262
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:08,216
Hang up!

263
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,353
How is it? Is she mad?

264
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:14,923
She is mad, but because the way she's
dressed, she looks pretty even when angry.

265
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:21,096
-Good luck.
-Power of Unity.

266
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,033
I thought he would ask for
you, but he just hung up.

267
00:26:25,901 --> 00:26:28,003
-That must mean he was overwhelmed.
-Of course.

268
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:31,239
He wouldn't have forgotten my face
this quickly after how many nights?

269
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:37,279
-Is that why he likes you?
-Medical Team! Medical Team!

270
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:42,751
Let's all gather to take a picture.

271
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,855
Let's go take a picture.
We came here for that.

272
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:49,124
-Team Leader Kang!
-I'm going.

273
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,997
I came here to do that, but that's
not the only thing I came for.

274
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,866
I couldn't do everything since
you started talking to me,

275
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:00,302
so check the supplies again

276
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:02,671
make sure you allow UN
to properly take over,

277
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:06,074
and be healthy until you go back.

278
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:17,119
Let's go home! Yay!

279
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:23,358
We're taking it! One, two, three.

280
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,465
Yes!

281
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:33,101
Thanks for all your hard work until now.

282
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:36,104
Good work!

283
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,775
As a sign of thanks, the division commander,

284
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,611
with the cooperation of the Air Force,
has provided helicopter transportation.

285
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:49,700
Then, we don't have to ride
the bus for four hours?

286
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:53,689
We will deliver you to Urk International
Airport under 30 minutes.

287
00:27:57,390 --> 00:28:00,640
Due to limited spaces, we will
send a group of people first...

288
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:02,030
Rock-paper-scissors!

289
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:09,538
Rock, paper, scissors!

290
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:13,975
-Come on!
-Hurry up!

291
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,378
Rock, paper, scissors!

292
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:23,530
Wow! It's really amazing!

293
00:28:23,752 --> 00:28:25,654
It's so beautiful!

294
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,889
We see this when we leave.

295
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:31,680
-It's wasteful.
-Look at that water color, wow.

296
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,463
People need to live
seeing such great sights.

297
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,750
We shouldn't be locked
in the operating rooms,

298
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:42,270
looking at intestines, colons,
or duodenum all day long...

299
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:44,806
Captain Yoo always used to say this, but

300
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,677
when we look at this, it's a
country we want to protect.

301
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,888
This should do.

302
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:24,272
Are you not going to hurry up?

303
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:36,651
You're so good looking. I...

304
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:39,390
Manager!

305
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,590
Hey, sleepmonster, Mr. Kang.

306
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:48,763
Safety hat. Safety hat on site. Aren't you
going to be diligent about wearing it?

307
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:51,199
My hair is going to get messed up.

308
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,872
Keep that up and your head's going to blow
up and you'll croak, you rotten rascal.

309
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,320
Next I need... bowls.

310
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:18,393
Where are the bowls...

311
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,106
Earthquake! Get out!

312
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:38,860
The hat! The hat!

313
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:40,608
Get out!

314
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,936
Manager!

315
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:41,202
What? What in the world is this?

316
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,280
URK 6.7 MAGNITUDE EARTHQUAKE.

317
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,570
Communication Network
Headquarter Office.

318
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,264
This is Captain Yoo Si
Jin from Alpha Team.

319
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:14,769
Connect me to anyone who is most up to date on Mohuru
situation. Without hanging, immediately now.

320
00:34:25,947 --> 00:34:27,370
Yesterday at four in the
afternoon local time...

321
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:31,619
Yes, the aid group is indeed scheduled to fly
home today but we are unable to reach them.

322
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:33,988
Yes. Yes, I understand.

323
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:39,500
This earthquake took place at 200 kilometers
outside Urk capital in the region of Mohuru.

324
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:42,380
The shake was said to have
felt in the capital of Minami.

325
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:46,350
Oh no. Oh no. What about my Chi Hoon?

326
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:50,004
It's okay. It will be okay.
Nothing will happen.

327
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:53,975
Am I supposed to know just because?
I just saw the news too.

328
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:57,312
I'm going into an emergency briefing right now
so I'll let you know as soon as there's news.

329
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:00,849
Injury and death toll is
currently under investigation.

330
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,840
This has been KBS news, Reporter Hwang.

331
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:08,150
We contact the headquarter but are still unable to
locate Lieutenant Yoon Myung Ju at Mohuru site.

332
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,580
And the aircraft request from airforce?

333
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:12,127
It's being provided. It's ready
for take off in ten minutes.

334
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,290
We will use all channels
to locate Lieutenant Yoon.

335
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:17,932
There is no time to waste on a lieutenant
during a mission. Don't do anything useless.

336
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:22,337
Seo Dae Young's been left out of the dispatch
personnel roster. Summon him and add him.

337
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:27,075
Sergeant Seo Dae Young submitted a request
to volunteer and he's already on standby.

338
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:29,811
Did you get a car ready?

339
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:31,346
Yes, I did.

340
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:45,894
How many times did I tell
you it can't be done?

341
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,440
The order is for the personnel aboard
the helicopter to return home first.

342
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:51,980
Since you never know, you
should leave while you can.

343
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:56,030
Why do you make me repeat myself? Do you
want to keep wasting time like this?

344
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,430
We'll take full responsibility,
so just take us there!

345
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,280
I can't. Please go. As ordered to,

346
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:03,978
I'm responsible for the medical team.

347
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:07,982
If this the earthquake, we are the
ones most needed at the site.

348
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:12,100
We have our colleagues left here as well.
We can't return home without them.

349
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,955
Why do you keep trying to we say not to?

350
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:19,460
I really don't like this.
Do you know that?

351
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:22,397
You just told us. Thank
you for those words.

352
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:28,310
What is the status of
central rescue dispatch?

353
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,573
It's a region still under dispute.

354
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,276
Legally, it's difficult to
dispatch civilian officials.

355
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:38,780
Can't and it's difficult
aren't real measures.

356
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:41,830
Our hospital medical team that
went there for volunteer aid

357
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,752
we don't yet have verification
whether they are alive or dead.

358
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:48,022
This is Commander Yoon Gil
Jun of Special Task Command.

359
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:52,220
My troop has rescuing
civilians as our top goal.

360
00:36:52,327 --> 00:36:54,600
I promise you that we'll use
whatever method possible.

361
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:56,931
So I'm asking what you're going to do?

362
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:59,234
If something bad happens
to our medical team,

363
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:06,941
If it's money, our Haesung Group
will provide whatever the amount.

364
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,470
Let's do whatever quickly.

365
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,949
The fastest C-17 tactical transport aircraft
will in 30 minutes at the hour of 01:00 exact,

366
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,852
depart Suwon Airport
to arrive at location.

367
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,922
In the transport aircraft, we
have from our special task

368
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,759
only the most veteran
personnel we drafted aboard.

369
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,332
Do you get your vacation hours back?

370
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:38,473
Although I'm only doing what needs to be
done, you can still respect me for it.

371
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:55,456
Ja Ae!

372
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:58,626
Ja Ae! Ja Ae!

373
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:02,870
Where's Han Ja Ae? Han Ja Ae!

374
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,667
Be quiet! I'm right here.

375
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:08,336
But why did you come? You didn't leave?

376
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:13,474
Are you all right? If you're
okay, then it's okay.

377
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:15,780
Are you all right? Was anybody injured?

378
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:18,800
It shook quite a bit, but
fortunately everyone is okay.

379
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:21,683
The phones don't connect, and
we can't contact anyone.

380
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:24,719
I was scared to death.

381
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:29,023
It's okay, don't cry. It's fortunate
that everyone is all right.

382
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:33,094
First, let's not scatter and be on standby here
and I'll try to get in contact with Seoul.

383
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,499
How is his condition?

384
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:42,236
Dislocated shoulder, but fortunately the
army doctor popped it back in at one go.

385
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:46,407
It's nothing much. I'm fine.

386
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:50,778
The barracks personnel didn't
suffer major injuries.

387
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:54,615
But why did you return? Is it
more severe near the airport?

388
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:57,140
Really? The planes aren't taking off?

389
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:59,620
No, there's nothing
major near the airport.

390
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:04,525
We couldn't reach you, so how could we leave?
That's why we turned the helicopter around.

391
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:10,231
That's a relief. I thought
we couldn't go home.

392
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:14,302
Medicube, Medicube, is there
an army doctor? Army Doctor!

393
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,071
This is Yoon Myung Ju, what is it?

394
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,007
This is the development center site.

395
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:22,143
it collapsed.

396
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:24,979
What did you say? I can't hear you.

397
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,449
The development center has collapsed.

398
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:35,056
Oh no!

399
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:41,389
Please put on your medical vests so
that the patients can easily find you.

400
00:40:41,389 --> 00:40:43,020
You all know the emergency
triage color tags system right?

401
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:45,380
Green for walking wounded,
}yellow for observation patients.

402
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:47,790
Patients that need immediate
treatment are tagged red.

403
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:51,720
Also, critical patients that
can not be treated on site,

404
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:53,634
will be tagged black, the same
color tag for the deceased.

405
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,370
Do not treat the patients
that are tagged black.

406
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:58,806
And focus on the patients
who can be saved.

407
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:01,740
Should we get prescription orders
from you for morphine or demerol?

408
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,644
No, it's impossible for me
to send an order each time.

409
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:06,660
Make the best judgement you can given
the circumstances and make the call.

410
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:09,350
Please take the best action possible.

411
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,419
Okay, let's go now.

412
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,416
Here!

413
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:52,226
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine. Here's a patient.

414
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:55,120
Patient! Patient, can you hear me?

415
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:58,132
He has some external hemorrhage.
He has a pulse, but he's unconscious.

416
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:01,870
He's in a state of temporary shock.
Help me get an IV started on him.

417
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,603
Okay.

418
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,015
Okay.

419
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,384
Nurse.

420
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,621
How is his condition?

421
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,757
Doctor!

422
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,092
Ah, wait.

423
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:31,200
I'm the chief manager in charge of this site.
Did the building investigation begin yet?

424
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:34,201
The building keeps collapsing, so we have
ceased any entrances into the building.

425
00:42:34,201 --> 00:42:36,971
But more than anything, do you have
a head count on all the employees?

426
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,940
We can't find Manager Koo.

427
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:40,675
Well,

428
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:44,890
It's the afternoon shift today, plus Manager Goo,
then there's about 30... how am I supposed to know!

429
00:42:45,012 --> 00:42:47,014
-What?
-Manager Go is probably out.

430
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,718
Let's do it like this for now.

431
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:55,389
I left something important
in the office, so...

432
00:42:56,624 --> 00:42:58,390
I'm going! Just wait!

433
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,470
-What?
-Please leave this area.

434
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:02,663
Hey, I have to get to the office! Hey!

435
00:43:03,698 --> 00:43:05,499
Doctor Ha! Doctor Ha!

436
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:07,668
Oh my God!

437
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:10,037
It's upper GI bleeding.

438
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,374
Doctor Chi Hoon! Doctor Chi Hoon!

439
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,464
For the love of God,
this is driving me nuts!

440
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:40,668
A person is here! Why
isn't anyone coming?

441
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:43,804
I said a person is here!

442
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,107
Someone is dying.

443
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,441
Manager?

444
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:52,279
I can't see. I can't see.

445
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,583
Hurry, hurry!

446
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:57,652
Hurry!

447
00:43:57,850 --> 00:43:59,987
Who is it?

448
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,492
It's me. Don't worry.

449
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:07,795
Hurry. It hurts.

450
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,731
I'm going to die!

451
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:13,167
What is it? Are you hurt?

452
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:17,204
Are you very hurt? Ah, seriously
why can't get out of this!

453
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:20,608
In any case, wait just a little.

454
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:23,644
Ok?

455
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:27,748
A person is here!

456
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:31,786
Is anyone outside?

457
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:35,856
Please save me today!

458
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:46,801
I'll take care of this patient.
Please go over there.

459
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:51,739
There's a doctor though.

460
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:57,178
No, leave this with me and go.

461
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:05,519
How is this patient's condition?

462
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:09,990
I still feel his pulse, so we
can save him if we keep going.

463
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:31,812
Even though he has a mild pulse, due to severe
hemorrhaging, he suffered a cardiac arrest.

464
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:36,117
I'm sorry to say, but
this patient is deceased.

465
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:37,284
No!

466
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,122
I can do it. I can save him.

467
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:45,593
Stop now.

468
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:52,399
-Time of death, Urk time...
-Don't!

469
00:45:54,468 --> 00:45:57,171
Wait, he was fine.

470
00:45:57,930 --> 00:45:59,340
He was okay.

471
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:04,411
He was normal, so we put
a yellow tag on him.

472
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,148
I called this one.

473
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:13,387
Pull yourself together!
Are you not going to?

474
00:46:14,255 --> 00:46:15,556
Now is not the time.

475
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:19,260
Stop whining and act like a doctor.

476
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:23,731
How am I a doctor?

477
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:27,301
I can't even color tag
a patient properly,

478
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:30,771
so how am I a doctor?

479
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:39,313
You are a doctor. Someone
who is very needed here.

480
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:41,549
You're that kind of doctor,

481
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:47,054
so you call this patient's time of death, and
go to where doctors are needed right now.

482
00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:51,892
Go to those patients who can be saved.
Can't you hear them crying out for help?

483
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:19,453
I'm asking you, Lee Chi Hoon.

484
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:34,969
Time of death,

485
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:39,807
Uruk time,

486
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:46,614
3:40p.m.

487
00:48:10,650 --> 00:48:12,039
Work hard.

488
00:48:32,359 --> 00:48:35,462
Hey, Kang Mo Yeon, you're
all right, aren't you?

489
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:38,399
Hurry up and call me. You must please.

490
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:43,604
I said I bought the wine.
Come quickly and drink it.

491
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:56,016
Now that I've been given permission
to pursue my medical profession,

492
00:48:57,090 --> 00:49:02,320
I solemnly take an oath to spend the rest
of my life volunteering to save people's lives.

493
00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:03,958
Medical team! Medical team!

494
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,161
Doctor, it's an emergency!

495
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:12,766
I will think about my patients'
health and lives first and foremost.

496
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:18,706
Regardless of race,
religion, or nationality

497
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:21,909
I will go beyond a social
status that transcends,

498
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,579
to meet my obligations to my patients.

499
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,220
One, two! Up!

500
00:49:31,352 --> 00:49:32,920
One, two!

501
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:36,190
Even if I am in danger,

502
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:41,061
I will not misuse of my knowledge.

503
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:53,374
It's a relief you weren't hurt badly.

504
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:05,986
What's wrong? Does it hurt somewhere?

505
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:21,001
This oath I take,

506
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:24,938
of my own volition

507
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:28,909
I devote my honor to it.

508
00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:42,689
Is he a survivor? Shall
I get the medical team?

509
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:40,374
Please help me. My friend is sick.

510
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:56,823
Attention!

511
00:52:58,130 --> 00:53:00,494
Salute to the commander!

512
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,429
Unity!

513
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:05,098
Unity!

514
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:22,816
You all have worked so hard.
Nobody is hurt right?

515
00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:24,051
No Sir!

516
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:27,020
That's good.

517
00:53:27,588 --> 00:53:30,190
You don't have to report the state now, I've
heard it on my way here so I will just skip that.

518
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:35,662
Starting from now, we'll start a full-fledged
structure tactic inside of the power plant.

519
00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:39,733
-Is anyone oppose to this?
-No sir!

520
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:42,769
Good.

521
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:47,708
Strategically speaking, there is
one thing you need to know...

522
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:56,550
Do not get hurt. If we get hurt then the
relief workers will lose their lives too.

523
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,053
-Understood?
-Understood sir!

524
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:03,423
You're dismissed. You may all
go back to your positions now.

525
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:05,025
We are going back to
our positions now sir!

526
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:34,688
I am glad that you are safe.
I was very worried about you.

527
00:54:36,410 --> 00:54:37,291
Well then.

528
00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:40,694
Sergeant Seo!

529
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:50,937
Please don't get hurt.
This is an order.

530
00:54:52,110 --> 00:54:56,076
Guard it with your life.
Do you understand me?

531
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,629
I was hoping that that you didn't get hurt...

532
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:30,537
I regretted this whole time...

533
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:34,141
For leaving without seeing
your face that morning.

534
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,277
I can't be by your side...

535
00:56:38,810 --> 00:56:40,046
so please...

536
00:56:42,810 --> 00:56:44,050
Take care of yourself.

537
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:46,019
You too, Captain.

538
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:13,540
You should let him know first.
He will be worried.

539
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:17,844
How about you? If I wasn't
safe, how would you have felt?

540
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:23,820
It means he is willingly going to walk into that
pile of concrete. He is asking for his own death.

541
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:26,052
-I'm going in. Give me some water.
-Let's go together.

542
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:29,756
It's aftershock!

543
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:32,592
What is this noise? Hurry up
and check the power plant!

544
00:58:32,870 --> 00:58:34,160
Dispatch. Dispatch?

545
00:58:34,330 --> 00:58:36,563
Sunbaenim! Sunbaenim!

546
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,160
Get them out now!

547
00:58:38,170 --> 00:58:40,534
The structure has gotten weaker.
If it collapses again...

548
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:44,304
It's useless to say it's
dangerous, isn't it?

549
00:58:44,810 --> 00:58:47,474
Hurry up! It's collapsing! Help me!

550
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:49,510
We've been disconnected.

551
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:50,977
Is anybody there?

552
00:58:51,590 --> 00:58:53,647
A person died here!
