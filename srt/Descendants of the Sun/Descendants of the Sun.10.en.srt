1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:01,618
God!

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:06,656
Save him.

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,394
You do your duty as a doctor.

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,497
If the need to kill comes,

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,768
I'll do it.

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,074
Don't save him.

7
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:27,744
Please, just let him die. Please.

8
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:41,458
It's a shock caused by a hemorrhage.
We need to move him inside.

9
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:46,496
It's your call.

10
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:51,902
You can put your gun down
and move him inside. Or just...

11
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:54,838
let him die here.

12
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,208
I recommend...

13
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:01,311
choosing the latter.

14
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,654
Hold tight.

15
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,024
It hurts like hell.

16
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,693
Are you giving me any painkillers?

17
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,671
I forgot because I'm
not a skilled doctor.

18
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,482
Wolf transmitting. Big Boss, Big Boss.

19
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,330
Do you hear me? Respond Big Boss.

20
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,287
I think the Korean army is coming.
Should we gather our side?

21
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,590
If Korean army is here,

22
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,427
-then we should retreat.
-But,

23
00:01:53,096 --> 00:01:54,297
they're not for you guys.

24
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,868
Then we should head back.

25
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:01,905
You can't take her.

26
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,042
I removed the bullet, but you
better get to the hospital first.

27
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,579
Only the best treatment is done, so...

28
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,748
you don't die right away.

29
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,288
Pretty, when I see you again,

30
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:23,326
promise, you're going to
die with that lovely face.

31
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:28,732
If you are going to leave,
run as fast as you can.

32
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,968
And, far away as you can.

33
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,372
My kindness is up to here.

34
00:02:46,172 --> 00:02:47,372
Descendants of the Sun
Episode 10

35
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,395
You're saying that Captain Agus quit?

36
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,265
Yes. Now, he's an arms dealer.

37
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:06,069
I met him at Downtown once.

38
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:13,076
When switching career from special task force,
it's either mercenary soldier or a criminal.

39
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:16,112
A special force member who took off
his uniform to follow after money.

40
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:19,883
I guess it's just a common progression.

41
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,365
They say that after a disaster, the following
disaster is measles and cholera. It's true.

42
00:03:37,534 --> 00:03:41,838
First it's an unprecedented surgery, then
earthquake and now, it's contagious diseases.

43
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,974
That's why as soon as we got
here I said let's run away...

44
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,844
Let's go.

45
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,880
Come over here. We're done.

46
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:53,817
The fever went down, but
we can't be relieved yet.

47
00:03:54,217 --> 00:03:56,019
For some, I see signs of pneumonia.

48
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,359
The pneumonia isn't too bad. We've had
enough training to handle measles too.

49
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,528
You go and change your clothes. Wash
the blood from your hands, too.

50
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,230
But, what blood is that?

51
00:04:20,243 --> 00:04:21,144
Save him.

52
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,147
You do your duty as a doctor.

53
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,420
If the need to kill comes, I'll do it.

54
00:04:38,628 --> 00:04:39,963
You know you're with a dangerous man.

55
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,701
There's more chance of getting
hurt being with a guy with a gun.

56
00:04:55,645 --> 00:04:59,449
Doctor Kang! You know the
girl you brought back?

57
00:04:59,816 --> 00:05:02,118
She's saying that she's leaving.
What should I do?

58
00:05:11,094 --> 00:05:14,130
Eat first. Let's talk after.

59
00:05:15,031 --> 00:05:18,310
Why did you save him? You
should have just let him die?

60
00:05:18,501 --> 00:05:22,850
You could have been a murderer if I
just let him die. I saved you from it.

61
00:05:23,006 --> 00:05:25,140
You stopped me from becoming a murderer.

62
00:05:25,308 --> 00:05:27,610
But, you can't stop me
from getting killed.

63
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:33,049
There is an army out there,
so you never get killed.

64
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,453
Army? You want me to trust soldiers?

65
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:42,258
Have you experienced war? Have
you seen a soldier in a war?

66
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:48,131
I didn't think so, so get out
of my way because I'm leaving.

67
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,468
What are you doing?

68
00:05:51,701 --> 00:05:54,504
You can blame me all you want, but

69
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:56,539
eat first.

70
00:06:00,076 --> 00:06:02,879
And, pull yourself together
if you want to run away.

71
00:06:06,983 --> 00:06:08,720
So, continue.

72
00:06:08,852 --> 00:06:11,450
So, we ran there and we saw.

73
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:15,470
The power plants are buried halfway below the
ground. The ground is continuing to spread apart.

74
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:20,830
The truck are smashed like beer cans. Patients
keep flowing out. And the mines keep blowing up.

75
00:06:21,364 --> 00:06:22,899
It was a mess.

76
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:27,003
Then, why are some people still there?

77
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,706
Ah, everyone wanted to come,

78
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,376
But, there are still patients there.
And they lack medical staff.

79
00:06:34,344 --> 00:06:36,946
Staying a few more days
may seem like nothing,

80
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,316
but us, who came first,
are feeling sorry.

81
00:06:43,086 --> 00:06:46,623
I'm sorry in the midst of your conversation,
but why didn't Chi Hoon come?

82
00:06:46,956 --> 00:06:50,990
He was definitely on the list for those who will
return, but why didn't he ride the airplane?

83
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:53,920
Ah, that's because right before we left,

84
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:57,060
There was a patient that urgently needed to
come to Korea. So, he gave up his ticket.

85
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:59,550
Oh, Lee Chi Hoon is a doctor now.

86
00:06:59,736 --> 00:07:03,573
Is it really because of a patient?
He's not cheating on me?

87
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,944
I mean how can he not call even once?

88
00:07:08,645 --> 00:07:12,749
Think about it carefully.
Was there nothing weird?

89
00:07:13,049 --> 00:07:15,084
Now that I look back, he was weird.

90
00:07:15,318 --> 00:07:18,888
Putting his illness aside, should I say
that it felt like he was being chased?

91
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:21,424
Who?

92
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,360
That pesky fake patient that
snatched up Dr. Lee's seat.

93
00:07:24,461 --> 00:07:27,430
He made that fuss to get a ticket,
but he didn't get on the plane.

94
00:07:27,964 --> 00:07:31,868
They couldn't find him, so
they left with one seat open.

95
00:07:32,435 --> 00:07:34,870
-Daebak.
-Then, did he sit in that seat?

96
00:07:35,071 --> 00:07:35,772
Who?

97
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,441
My soul.

98
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:48,010
I... like that side of Doctor Song.
I think he's very fun.

99
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,118
Nurse Choi.

100
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:53,122
Me too.

101
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:56,626
Seems like the measles is already
spreading in the refugee camps.

102
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:59,629
UN's already issued an
warning about measles too.

103
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,598
I got the call from the headquarters.

104
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:04,534
I packed enough MMR vaccines.
So, don't worry.

105
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:09,339
There are more than 10 kids left in the village.
Wouldn't it be better if I went with you?

106
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,140
Are you going to act so
senseless like this?

107
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,777
The person-in-charge of security
tomorrow is Sergeant First Class Seo.

108
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:19,280
It's a visitation both business and personal.
So let's have the civilian stay out of it.

109
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,017
You're in the deep.

110
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,253
You're leaving early
in the morning, right?

111
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,410
Why are you so friendly? I think
we still have leftover grudge?

112
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,726
It seems that I am a much more
honorable person than you.

113
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:31,995
Have a safe trip.

114
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,735
She's not scared of the
sister-in-law act anymore.

115
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:46,075
Wow, the weather is so nice.

116
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,846
The guy sitting next
to me is even better.

117
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,618
What's so great about going with a dark skinned
solider to a civil affairs operations?

118
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,021
It's because my standards are high.

119
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,890
Are you sure your standards are high?

120
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,726
Do you not see the mirror every morning?

121
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:09,165
If you're not going to look,
show me your handsome face.

122
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:19,142
Have you ever thought about
what you'll do if you quit?

123
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,177
Are you serious?

124
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,812
For me.

125
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,149
What are you talking about?

126
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:31,654
It's a dangerous duty, and we have
to be apart most of the time.

127
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,026
Are you saying this for me?

128
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,828
You're worried about me?

129
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,164
Worried about us?

130
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,436
For some reason it seems like I
should feel touched right now.

131
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,238
I'm fine.

132
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,909
I like the current
Sergeant Seo Dae Young.

133
00:09:56,112 --> 00:10:01,484
The Seo Dae Young I know is either wearing
an uniform or not wearing an uniform.

134
00:10:02,485 --> 00:10:03,620
It's only one of those two.

135
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:08,358
Unless I take it off, nobody
is touching that uniform.

136
00:10:32,482 --> 00:10:34,217
It doesn't seem as if anyone is here.

137
00:10:35,785 --> 00:10:37,153
The village is completely empty.

138
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,040
URK TAEBAEK, UNIT HEADQUARTERS.

139
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,830
You should know who he is.
Runaway American soldier, Agus.

140
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,832
Currently, an illegal arms dealer.

141
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:54,170
I'm aware that this man was there in the
operations where we lost Captain Kim Jin Suk.

142
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:56,506
Yes, that's true.

143
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:10,600
Through UN Senate Chief, American CIA has
sent request for cooperation from us.

144
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:13,322
Is this a joint operation against
illegal firearms exchange?

145
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,223
No.

146
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:18,161
This mission isn't about
justice, it's politics.

147
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,900
This is North Urk's current
second-in-command, Amang.

148
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,670
The wish is to erect a coup in North Urk
and establish a Pro-American government.

149
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,306
That's why through Argus,

150
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,509
the plan to sell firearms
in large amounts to Amang.

151
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,086
The Delta Force Captain is already
carrying out his mission.

152
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,723
They said this is a friend
you know very well.

153
00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:01,170
Until their operations is finished. To
reword it, while they are manipulating Agus,

154
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,160
I'm requesting that you cooperate
in avoiding any conflict with them.

155
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:06,242
We won't carry out
precautionary measures.

156
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:09,011
But maintaining security of area
is a basic task of Forces Troop.

157
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:11,414
-Yoo Si Jin.
-Captain Yoo Si Jin.

158
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:16,753
This is what the Field Commander is personally
requesting. This is not just a situation report.

159
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:20,256
I flew all the way over here
to get a hold of you guys.

160
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,091
In 10 minutes, you have to fly again.

161
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:25,094
It means I've expressed my good faith.

162
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,230
It's an order.

163
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,467
From now on, our soldiers are not to
involve themselves in these matters.

164
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:34,871
Yes sir.

165
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:41,644
We checked with police and they moved the children
from goblin village to the CTA orphanage.

166
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:43,846
But something seems off.

167
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:48,918
Captain?

168
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,456
From this moment on,

169
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,260
we are not to involve ourselves
in any of Agus's matters.

170
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,265
I just came back from headquarters.

171
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,702
What I'm about to tell you

172
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,006
is top-tier confidential.

173
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,236
Because you looked like
you needed some sugar.

174
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,272
I'm giving you the last one.

175
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,546
Thank you.

176
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,381
Do you want to share?

177
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:56,452
I'll get fat. Drink it quickly,
thinking of it as medicine.

178
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,794
What happened to the children
from goblin village?

179
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,529
Because I haven't seen
Lieutenant Yoon yet.

180
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,865
It was taken care of properly.

181
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:12,430
The Urk government is putting them under
the protection of a specialized agency.

182
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,769
That's great.

183
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:18,241
The children who were brought to MediCube weren't
treated too late so they're in good health.

184
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,243
So that's why you were so busy.

185
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,745
Without enough time for
you to tie your hair.

186
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,849
Hold this for a bit.

187
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:31,220
Whenever you ask me to hold something
for a bit, you tend to do weird things.

188
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:35,124
Oh, you can't. I wasn't
able to wash my hair today.

189
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:37,793
Why not? Because you
didn't have enough water?

190
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:41,360
You typically don't even wash it so
why are you pretending like you do?

191
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:42,732
That's not me.

192
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,234
Exactly when will I meet Dr. Kang?

193
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,141
I can do it myself.

194
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:57,380
Usually dating is when things that "I can
do myself" are done by the other person.

195
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,016
I will do it for you later too.

196
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,452
The things that you can
do by yourself, I will.

197
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,455
Keep your promise.

198
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,810
This is Dormitory B. Some medical supply and
personal packages have arrived from Korea.

199
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,508
Oh, package. Package.

200
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:30,212
Are you leaving me
because a package came?

201
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:34,784
-Package or me?
-Of course it's you.

202
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:42,058
This is from Doctor Pyo.

203
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,361
As expected, there's
nobody like Doc Pyo.

204
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,831
Ah, the smell of Korea.

205
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,768
The smell of Korean boxes.

206
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,707
Oh, I will deliver this myself.

207
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,142
Looks like relations are
good between you two.

208
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,316
Did anything come for you?

209
00:16:07,316 --> 00:16:08,951
You should ask for yours,
why would you ask for mine?

210
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,587
Surprising enough,
something came for you.

211
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,790
Who sent it?

212
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,060
I did.

213
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,670
This for you.

214
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,638
240, right?

215
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:34,643
Doctor Song.

216
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,347
I don't need a thanks.

217
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,149
I'm 230.

218
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:44,754
It's okay. No one will know.

219
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,889
I know.

220
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:10,279
Sergeant Seo. There's a package from someone
named Shin Jae Young. Where are you? Over.

221
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,783
Where are you right now?

222
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:19,188
At the kitchen. Should I wait, over?

223
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,098
-Oh! That surprised me.
-I'm going to have to inspect this real quick.

224
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,701
Oppa, stay strong. Heart?

225
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,571
I miss you, oppa. Heart?!

226
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,960
Ha?

227
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,608
Does Sergeant Seo have a younger sister?

228
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,978
-Sergeant Seo is an only child!
-That shouldn't be my fault.

229
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,216
Can you do that?

230
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:32,561
Hey.

231
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,531
What is it? Why is Yoo Si Jin here?

232
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:43,072
The day we met Si Jin oppa.
We send our memories to you.

233
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,842
These men. Yoon,

234
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,011
bring your gun.

235
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,182
-It's a misunderstanding.
-It's definitely a misunderstanding.

236
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:56,986
Misunderstanding?

237
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:01,624
When the evidence is this clear.
A misunderstanding?

238
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:05,410
I guess I see your best
smile through this photo.

239
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,762
I wasn't smiling in that.

240
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:11,033
It looks like I'm smiling but I'm
just funny looking. Isn't that right?

241
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:15,271
It's my younger cousin. Don't you know that
my younger cousin is a flight attendant?

242
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,873
Then a package came from
just your younger cousin,

243
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,820
but you two ran here as a set?

244
00:19:19,975 --> 00:19:21,777
Because they played as a set.

245
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,081
Between the two of them, which
one is the younger cousin?

246
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,016
-Yes?
-Excuse me?

247
00:19:27,016 --> 00:19:30,186
You will answer on the count of three at the same
time whether it's left side or the right side.

248
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,253
One, two, three.

249
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,421
-Left.
-Right.

250
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,358
-Left.
-Right.

251
00:19:40,829 --> 00:19:45,100
I only participated in a blind date arranged by
Lieutenant Colonel, nothing more, nothing less.

252
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:49,630
Are you throwing him
under the bus right now?

253
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:50,739
Yes, I am.

254
00:19:52,174 --> 00:19:56,812
You must have kept in touch with her throughout
in Urk, seeing that she knows this address.

255
00:19:57,112 --> 00:20:00,716
Did you really? Why did you
do that, Sergeant Seo?

256
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,885
I can't understand this guy.

257
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:07,389
That just took a lot for him to say.
I'm saying he did well.

258
00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:09,625
Never mind that. Follow me.

259
00:20:10,893 --> 00:20:12,995
-Yes, I'm coming.
-Aren't you standing still?

260
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:19,568
I thought she was talking to me. Because
it has become a habit for me to follow.

261
00:20:20,436 --> 00:20:22,871
You better go quickly.

262
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,074
I wish we could stay together.

263
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:30,646
Power of unity.

264
00:20:33,515 --> 00:20:36,320
I hope you wouldn't misunderstand.
It's all in the past.

265
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:41,724
Yeah, right, in the past. Then
did this come from the past?

266
00:20:42,891 --> 00:20:44,026
It came from Seoul.

267
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:49,360
I was right. It was obvious
it was a blind date.

268
00:20:49,465 --> 00:20:54,370
Are you talking about the first birthday party of
Bravo team Park's son? The day they disappeared?

269
00:20:57,573 --> 00:20:59,908
They said that a high school
alumnus' father had passed away.

270
00:21:00,309 --> 00:21:03,560
It doesn't make sense that the two
of them would have the same alumni.

271
00:21:03,712 --> 00:21:05,748
They couldn't get their story
straight with us either.

272
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:08,120
They were both dressed
differently that day.

273
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:11,420
I thought they both would be
hosting a first birthday party.

274
00:21:13,756 --> 00:21:17,550
Is this the reason you avoided me? I
thought my dad was the stumbling block.

275
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,395
It's true your father was
the stumbling block.

276
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,963
What did you just say?

277
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:26,460
-What did I just say?
-Never mind that. How far did you two go?

278
00:21:26,568 --> 00:21:28,137
We went as far as the army entrance.

279
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:31,106
Am I asking about that right now?

280
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:34,700
How far did you go? Was
there skinship or not?

281
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:40,180
I didn't! It was really pure.
I only drank some tea.

282
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,920
What a gentleman.

283
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:43,018
You flatter me.

284
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,660
So you enjoyed tea with a woman.

285
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:50,340
Here I thought when we parted you looked like
you'd never even see the letter W in Woman ever.

286
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:54,563
I felt sorry for you by myself. Not know
you were having such a great time.

287
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,032
I didn't have a good time.

288
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:01,760
And to be honest, it was due to that camaraderie
that I had no choice but to be dragged to it.

289
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,439
Camaraderie your house.

290
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:07,476
It's not that you couldn't help it, your face looks
as if you couldn't contain yourself.

291
00:22:07,476 --> 00:22:08,310
You liked it so much.

292
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,113
You saw it so briefly, I think
you're misunderstanding it.

293
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:16,051
I had kept a stone-face. I only
drank tea with this expression.

294
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:18,053
Don't make me laugh!

295
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,640
How do I know if you drank
tea with or gave her a ride?

296
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:21,724
I didn't give her a ride.

297
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,561
If you lie, you'll only
make things worse.

298
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:30,699
I did give her a ride.

299
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:34,636
It wasn't my car. It was
Lieutenant Colonel's car.

300
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:40,776
I really couldn't understand
why he brought a car.

301
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,878
You're telling me to believe that?

302
00:22:42,878 --> 00:22:44,480
I'm telling you to forget that.

303
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:47,649
I really don't even
remember her name now.

304
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:52,488
You don't remember the name but you came running
when you heard the three words, Shin Ji Young?

305
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:54,823
That isn't it.

306
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,992
This is so irritating.
Really ticking me off.

307
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:01,397
Just know that this person saved you.

308
00:23:01,597 --> 00:23:03,365
Who is it? Is it a man?

309
00:23:03,699 --> 00:23:08,140
I don't think it's the time for it. If it's a woman or
if it's a man, what are you going to do about it?

310
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,639
If it's a woman, I'll buy a meal and
if it's a man, I'll buy him a drink.

311
00:23:12,007 --> 00:23:13,275
Because I owe them.

312
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:18,013
It's the chairman, why?

313
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,787
It's the chairman, why?

314
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,525
Doc Pyo!

315
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:32,261
If I sent you something, girl,

316
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:36,031
"Thanks." "I got it."
Shouldn't you say something?

317
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:38,960
Sorry. I was busy so
I haven't opened it.

318
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:41,970
Why are you so busy? Dating?

319
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,840
I heard you and that captain
or whatever kissed!

320
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:45,874
How did you know?!

321
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:49,912
How else would I know? I heard it.
I also heard you two fought today.

322
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,747
How did you know that too?

323
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:53,282
You've been pegged, girlfriend.

324
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:56,885
I guess you are really dating.

325
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:58,187
Hey, you...

326
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:00,456
Just a minute. Doctor Jang
wants to talk to you.

327
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:05,627
Doctor, it's me.

328
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:10,332
By chance, are you lying that Lee Chi
Hoon is alive when he's actually dead?

329
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:14,036
What are you talking about? You
still haven't been in contact?

330
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:15,070
No.

331
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:19,007
Did I get my engagement broken off?

332
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:23,212
This punk. Wait a moment.
He's probably doing rounds.

333
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:39,495
It's a painkiller. It
will sting a little.

334
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:44,933
Never mind that. Why don't you just go?

335
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:47,569
Just seeing you gives me pain.

336
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:57,012
Get that away! Why would I get a shot
not knowing what you'll give me?

337
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:02,351
If you were me, would you
want to be treated by you?

338
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:09,358
Don't you hear me? I said to go,
because I'm not going to get the shot.

339
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:17,332
Please save me.

340
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:26,942
Please pull me out.

341
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:35,017
I did it because I was scared. You
were right about everything you said.

342
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:41,223
In that moment, I wasn't a good doctor.

343
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:48,864
I'm very sorry for
running away by myself.

344
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:59,975
You're really self-centered.
You want to confess to me

345
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:04,713
and get rid of some of that burden?

346
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:07,816
If I could get rid of it that
easily, I already would have.

347
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:14,690
I just don't know what to do.

348
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:19,861
Please tell me. I'll do
what you tell me to.

349
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:26,268
No matter how I think about it,

350
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:30,606
there's nobody to save me but you.

351
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:35,444
Even if I'm the only one, don't reach out
to me. You didn't take my hand either.

352
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:38,380
You didn't rescue me!

353
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:46,421
So don't reach out your hand towards me, because
I'm not going to take your hand either.

354
00:26:54,770 --> 00:27:00,636
I'll ask Doctor Song, so
please get your shot.

355
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:22,958
Lee Chi Hoon, where are you? Why
aren't you in the Medi Cube?

356
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:25,560
While I'm saying it nicely,

357
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:39,641
You're really sick.

358
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:49,785
When did you get here? Did
you come by yourself again?

359
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:55,857
You worry me. Why do you go
around alone so dangerously?

360
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:04,733
Why are you so sick?

361
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:19,281
Where did he hide himself?

362
00:28:21,249 --> 00:28:25,520
Doctor Han, Doctor Song, Doctor Kang,
this is the pharmacy. Please come here.

363
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:26,755
There's a big problem!

364
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:39,000
Amazing they got this off.
What's missing?

365
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:42,070
The narcotics painkillers packages.
They've all disappeared.

366
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:45,340
Codeine, morphine, fentanyl,
levorphanol. All of it.

367
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,109
When was the last time it was checked?

368
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:52,247
11:00 AM. There wasn't anyone unfamiliar
and no patients missing, how did this happen?

369
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:57,686
Even if no patients
disappeared, one person has.

370
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:01,757
This is Medi Cube. Has
anyone seen Fatima today?

371
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:05,026
Tommy, it's me.

372
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,462
I stole the pills like you told me to.

373
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,264
Where shall I bring them?

374
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:12,968
Okay, I miss you a lot.

375
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:15,203
We should run away after selling these.

376
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:16,304
I love you.

377
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:20,208
Fatima wouldn't be here though.

378
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,410
There's information here.

379
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,349
How have you been?

380
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:31,119
Looks like you need something more
than my welcome. What do you need?

381
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:33,922
Information.

382
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:38,393
A red dress, 15 year old girl.

383
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:41,062
She's stealing narcotics.

384
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,731
I keep telling you,

385
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:47,702
we sell in here everything
but women and information.

386
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:53,542
You don't have to. But there
must be someone else who could.

387
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:59,080
Hey, please help us. She's
only fifteen years old.

388
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:04,085
We need to find her
before someone else does.

389
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,395
Where's the black market for narcotics?

390
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,218
It should be near here.

391
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,980
How do we find it here?
Do we have to go dig everywhere?

392
00:30:42,858 --> 00:30:43,660
It's over there!

393
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,906
Son of a bitch! Were you lying
to me this whole time?!

394
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:01,977
No, Fatima, no. You trusted me too much.

395
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:05,647
Follow me before I beat you harder.

396
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,930
Bitch, you want to die?

397
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,818
Stop it! Don't hit her!

398
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:12,554
Isn't he a soldier?

399
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:13,855
Why is he here?

400
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:16,358
Don't worry, we've got
more weapons than him.

401
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:25,467
I don't know what you guys are
looking for? I hope it's not us.

402
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:29,571
More guns? Why are there guns everyday?
What kind of country is this?

403
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:32,574
It's because you were acting
alone without any discussion.

404
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:35,580
If we came a little later,
Fatima might have been hit more.

405
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:36,678
Yes, good job.

406
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,380
Because we're about to get
shot but Fatima is fine.

407
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:40,715
What the hell are they talking about?

408
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:45,754
Who cares? Put your gun down
if you don't want to die.

409
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,856
What are we going to do?

410
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:49,824
It isn't like there isn't a way.

411
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:53,728
7 guns. Dr. Kang, you
take the right side

412
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:55,597
I'll take the left side.

413
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,167
Don't be scared.

414
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,503
Okay.

415
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,272
Let's make a deal.

416
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:08,910
I'll drop my weapon. Let the girls go.

417
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,679
What the hell are you talking about?

418
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:16,117
You'll put your gun down and
girls, get on your knees now.

419
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:20,922
I thought I could fool him.

420
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,330
You think that makes sense now?

421
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,491
End of jokes.

422
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,661
From now on, listen
to me very carefully.

423
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:32,534
When I say, "now," run away no matter what
and bring the car and wait by the door.

424
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,902
Five minutes will do.

425
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,771
If five minutes pass and I'm not out

426
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:41,343
just leave no matter what. That's helping
me. Do you understand what I'm saying?

427
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,780
What does that bastard keep saying?

428
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:49,117
Shut up and drop your weapon.

429
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,055
Okay. Oh, oh, oh.

430
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,725
Okay, I'll drop it,
I'm going to drop it.

431
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:01,463
Do I just drop it? Do
you like this spot?

432
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:08,403
I can't use this gun anyway.

433
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:12,941
If I shoot this gun, I'll have
to write too many reports.

434
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:17,846
So what I'm saying is,
let me use your guns.

435
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:19,948
Now!

436
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:08,363
Five minutes have passed,
why isn't he coming out?

437
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,932
I don't know! I have no choice!

438
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,326
What the fuck?

439
00:34:43,364 --> 00:34:44,990
Get in quickly! Fatima, come on!

440
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,934
Hurry!

441
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:58,513
Wow, awesome! This is totally exciting!

442
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,282
Nobody would be following
us, would they?

443
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,084
We did it!

444
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:07,322
I'm still excited! Did you
become a soldier for this?

445
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:10,959
I fought off the enemy!

446
00:35:11,226 --> 00:35:13,080
You do know that you almost
fought me off as well, right?

447
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:14,696
Of course I thought you would avoid it

448
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:16,598
I had it all calculated!

449
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:21,136
With calculations like that, how did
you make it through med school?

450
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:26,841
Oh! Oh? Oh.

451
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,318
Why is the car like this?

452
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,856
Why wouldn't know when you
crushed it that much?

453
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,460
Now that's three wrecked
cars, this woman.

454
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,918
I don't have any plans of
having a superior son-in-law.

455
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,353
So instead, take off
your military uniform.

456
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,590
Go into Myung Ju's maternal family's
business and learn the work.

457
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,926
Think about it until you
complete your dispatch,

458
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:21,262
and when you return to the
country, come with your decision.

459
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:32,006
You really don't listen!

460
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:36,244
It's dangerous so I'm sure I told
you to stay put where it was safe.

461
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:42,116
It's lonely where it's safe.

462
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:47,055
After two steps to the
left, face me directly.

463
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:53,261
You've been ignoring your
superior's words too often lately.

464
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,164
Face toward the front.

465
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:03,404
One step forward.

466
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,870
What are you doing right now?

467
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:17,518
I'm not trying to make up. I'm
just having physical contact.

468
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,270
The kids are watching.

469
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,610
Where are there kids over there?

470
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,290
Do you know that this is a harassment?

471
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:25,860
Why? Is it too harsh because it's
not from a flight attendant?

472
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,334
It's harsh because it's First
Lieutenant Yoon Myung Ju.

473
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,873
The kids are watching.

474
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,577
I can win against anyone.

475
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:59,394
Big Boss transmitting. Location is roughly
15 km from the city towards the barracks.

476
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:02,864
Car is down. If there is any
soldier within radius, contact me.

477
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,835
I'll let go for a moment.

478
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,737
I can't win against this guy.

479
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,739
He's of no help to me.

480
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:17,011
Wolf transmitting. Currently on landmine
operation, direction of Goblin Village.

481
00:38:17,178 --> 00:38:18,346
What's the matter?

482
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:21,849
Why do you always get stuck on the road?

483
00:38:21,849 --> 00:38:23,318
No kidding.

484
00:38:23,584 --> 00:38:25,219
Just send anyone.

485
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,323
Transmission received.
Will send Sergeant Gong.

486
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:43,538
How would she know to only select
the narcotic painkillers to take?

487
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:48,343
She must have had a life of first learning
what is expensive and what is cheap.

488
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:51,120
The things that save the most people,

489
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:55,249
disinfectants, antibiotics, and
vaccinations are all inexpensive medicines.

490
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,319
It would have been good if she had
a life of learning that first.

491
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,491
You know what you did wrong...

492
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:06,227
would be what in English?

493
00:39:08,629 --> 00:39:10,131
It looks like she understood.

494
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:16,137
From now on, you do whatever I say.

495
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:17,872
You have no choice.

496
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,340
Go back to school first.

497
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:21,020
Why do you even care?

498
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:23,778
Why wouldn't I care when I saved you!

499
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,049
And don't talk back! When you talk back, I'm
forced to speak more with my broken English.

500
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:30,585
I'm about the throw up. In any case,

501
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:35,857
I'll pay for your tuition,
so finish school first.

502
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,126
Of course, it's not free.

503
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:42,163
I'm just lending it to
you, so pay back after.

504
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,364
Okay?

505
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:49,370
It seems like she understood
everything I said, right?

506
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,306
Especially the part where you
said it wasn't for free.

507
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:54,175
I rolled my tongue, so that
it would appear that way.

508
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:57,845
I did promise. I did.

509
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:05,953
I didn't wash my hair.

510
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:19,567
What are you doing?

511
00:40:20,802 --> 00:40:23,704
I'm drying my hair. The
air here is the best.

512
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,541
You finally washed your hair.

513
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:28,810
Did you really wash your hair?

514
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:30,745
Is the water coming out fine?

515
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:32,079
Go to sleep!

516
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:36,484
It's such a wasteful for the night
to just go to sleep, isn't it?

517
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,287
Want to go eat ramyun?

518
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:43,391
What is it? This insincere offer?

519
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:48,496
It's a very sincere temptation.

520
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:51,999
Call!

521
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:56,620
Power of unity. The boiling
water is on standby.

522
00:40:56,737 --> 00:40:58,506
Refreshing two bowls of ramyun.

523
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,508
I will prepare it.

524
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:05,546
What happened to the car?
Can it be fixed?

525
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,249
I'm still looking into it.

526
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:11,619
Do you know how much the debt for damaging
Daniel's car is? And you do it again today.

527
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:13,488
And even the tuition fee for that girl.

528
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:17,058
Are you really going to pay
for Fatima's school fees?

529
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,261
-Why?
-It seems like you're suitable for doctor's coat.

530
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:24,065
Touching someone else's life

531
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,968
makes your responsibility
for that person bigger.

532
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,605
I'm just doing what I can to my ability.

533
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,540
Even if it's haphazard.

534
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:36,711
You know who said that, right?

535
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,650
Me, well... I don't forget that well.

536
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:42,316
You can't take responsibility
for everyone that you meet.

537
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:44,210
It's not like the world
will change that way.

538
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:46,420
Even though it doesn't change the world,

539
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,956
it will change the life of Fatima.

540
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:53,094
And to Fatima, it will be something
to see that the world changed.

541
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:54,829
Then that will do.

542
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,940
You told me you weren't
that kind of doctor.

543
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:00,134
You said I was that kind
of doctor after seeing me?

544
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:03,571
Why are you always being so charming?

545
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,740
I've already fallen nonetheless.

546
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:09,176
A woman with a lot of debts

547
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:12,079
is easier to dump the more debt she has.

548
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,718
Thank you for saving today.

549
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:24,292
I have prepared two refreshing bowls.

550
00:42:25,726 --> 00:42:27,128
Thank you.

551
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,497
I will enjoy the food.

552
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:35,970
Oh? At a time like this? Why?

553
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:38,839
Don't you have a lantern?
The ramyun will bloat.

554
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:43,377
Should we try eating late night
snacks special forces style?

555
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:47,582
So funny! What is this?

556
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:50,885
I get to do all sorts of things
meeting special forces man.

557
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,522
It seems that you were
made for the army.

558
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:57,091
Let's change that to a
special forces lover.

559
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,926
Then what other things would I do?

560
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:01,295
Ah! Should we try soccer?

561
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:05,199
I need to tell the others when I go to
back to Korea about military soccer.

562
00:43:06,133 --> 00:43:08,269
Here, refreshingly, one shot.

563
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,805
One shot.

564
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:18,679
It's finally coming out.

565
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:23,451
Aish! If I knew this would happen,
I would have just drank water.

566
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:50,337
Aish! This feces smell!
Ah, seriously!

567
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:10,024
Chief Manager Shin is
arrested in the airport?

568
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:12,893
Yes. He was arrested for
fraudulent identity.

569
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:17,264
But it wasn't by American Army or
INTERPOL but by Mohuru Police.

570
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,668
The embassy is in the state
to confirm his identity.

571
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:25,940
It means there's someone who mobilized the
Mohuru Police Chief to attain Chief Jin.

572
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:28,008
Could it possibly
because of the diamond?

573
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:32,546
The diamond... if it's this
big, how much would it be?

574
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:33,914
Diamond?

575
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:37,718
Tell me in detail.

576
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:40,554
I saw it every time the the material
loading trucks came through.

577
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:43,057
He placed it in the safe.

578
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:58,470
Materials vehicles? Ones
that cross the borders?

579
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,576
He always managed the
materials trucks personally.

580
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:06,547
On some days he would
have blood on his leg.

581
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:12,586
That diamond... it was real?

582
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:16,290
That unlucky bastard. I
thought he was suspicious.

583
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:17,858
Why are you saying that
suspicious thing now?

584
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:21,762
I was busy coming back to life
from the dead. What do you expect?

585
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:25,766
It seems like it was because of the diamond that's
why he was insistent on going to his office.

586
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:28,302
That's right. That's why.

587
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:31,572
If the diamond is this
big, how much would it be?

588
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,674
I don't have a good feeling about this.

589
00:46:33,941 --> 00:46:35,609
Usually, in circumstances
like this, the police

590
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:38,760
a corpse from a bizarre death arrives.

591
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:41,315
That corpse was Manager Shin.

592
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:43,717
I'm getting the sense we may need
to write a very long report.

593
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:46,487
I get a feeling that I will
be writing that long report.

594
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:51,759
Where are you going?
How much would it be?

595
00:46:54,628 --> 00:46:55,930
They don't know.

596
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:18,352
We looked everywhere. We cannot find it.

597
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:19,687
Did you really?

598
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:26,794
You didn't look through his stomach.

599
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:30,698
Bring the table.

600
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:02,930
Get down!

601
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:05,099
Hands up!

602
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:32,526
Don't move.

603
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:39,066
If you do, you will die this time.

604
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:48,375
Target secured.

605
00:48:52,370 --> 00:48:54,048
The target is safe.

606
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:00,020
Do we really just leave the rest?

607
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:08,963
By our plan, we just get
our country's bad guys.

608
00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:12,633
For now, the alpha team is retreating.

609
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,537
Are the diamonds that
you have from Agus.

610
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:52,139
What?

611
00:49:54,110 --> 00:49:57,277
Diamonds? What diamonds
are you talking about?

612
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:02,449
I was literally dragged out without any
pants on so how can I have such a thing?

613
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:07,921
Listen carefully.

614
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:11,225
I have to how much you
are worth to Agus.

615
00:50:11,770 --> 00:50:15,162
So I can see what's in it for me
since I am taking care of your ass.

616
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:21,702
I am in pain, so call the doctor for me.

617
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:23,137
The doctor is here.

618
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:26,273
I think I found what the
client is looking for

619
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:29,643
I think he is passed the
age to be chewing rocks.

620
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,548
Did he swallow this?

621
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:42,089
Hey mister, it's no use
playing sick like this now.

622
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,634
His breathing is weak
and so is his pulse.

623
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:57,237
The diamonds inside his stomach is
causing him to have an enterohemorrhage

624
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:01,408
I inform that there is an emergency patient here.
Medical Team, prepare the operating room please.

625
00:51:08,582 --> 00:51:10,617
I paged Senior Hong but why is
Lieutenant Yoon here instead?

626
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:13,253
Senior Hong is not well today
so I paged her instead.

627
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,888
The substitute is ready to work.

628
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:17,420
The blood pressure is
constantly going down.

629
00:51:17,430 --> 00:51:20,294
I will hurry it up. I will get to doing
the abdominal operation right away. Mass.

630
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:26,967
The bleeding is very heavy.

631
00:51:27,290 --> 00:51:30,137
So did this patient really
swallow all those diamonds?

632
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:33,740
Yeah. I think it looks like we'll get to
really see diamonds made out of blood.

633
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:36,443
It's a mess inside.
Please hold this for me.

634
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:37,211
Okay.

635
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:46,820
Oh, I am so sorry. I think I
got the wrong blood vessel.

636
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:47,888
I got it.

637
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,562
It's not the blood vessel.

638
00:51:57,010 --> 00:51:58,899
The tumor connected to the
lymphoma has popped open.

639
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:01,535
The actual bleeding is from the diamonds

640
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:04,338
but what is controlling the lymphoma.

641
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:11,445
If he wasn't pretending to cough
and have breathing problems...

642
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,283
Everyone stop what you are doing.

643
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,386
Everyone drop what you are doing and
step away from the operating table now!

644
00:52:22,290 --> 00:52:25,893
Coughing, difficulty in breathing,
stomach hemorrhage, and lymphoma

645
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:28,162
as I combine all the symptoms here

646
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:32,733
this patient is showing an intense
and infectious Virus symptom.

647
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,903
I can make a rough guess that this is
related to an M virus malignant pestilence.

648
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:38,972
Until we get an accurate
diagnosis the operating room

649
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:41,375
will be off limits and I will take
measures to make that happen.

650
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:49,216
All of you leave this room except for Lieutenant
Yoon and I who are already contaminated.

651
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:50,784
What about the operation?

652
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,954
I think the both of us would
have to finish the job.

653
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:06,900
What is a meningitis virus? I would like
you to explain it to me in detail please.

654
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:10,537
It is one of the euryphagic
infectious disease.

655
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:15,309
The only way to find out if it's either
an M2 or M3 is to go through a PCR test.

656
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,846
What's the difference?

657
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:24,518
If it's M2 then it would
be more severe than a flu

658
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,455
and if it's M3 then it's
tumor caused by lymphoma.

659
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:35,028
Oh no, it's dangerous over here so you
have to talk from where you are at.

660
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:37,864
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

661
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:43,103
How could he be such in pain right away?
We would just have to wait and see.

662
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:45,239
We are drawing blood right now.

663
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:50,577
Yoon Myung Ju.

664
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:53,247
But it's still quite admirable.

665
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:56,250
Don't you think you ran over here even faster...

666
00:53:56,516 --> 00:53:57,790
than the time when you received the package?

667
00:53:57,790 --> 00:53:59,253
Are you okay?

668
00:54:00,590 --> 00:54:04,658
Wow. Did I make the mighty
Seo Dae Young scared?

669
00:54:11,570 --> 00:54:12,866
What do I have to do?

670
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:15,002
What should I do for you? Just tell me.

671
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:20,073
An answer. "The day I met you" heart was

672
00:54:20,570 --> 00:54:23,160
from the one on the left or
right side... who wrote it?

673
00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:25,312
Left side. She was very charming.

674
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:27,514
Oh is that so?

675
00:54:28,190 --> 00:54:29,916
She must have been very charming.

676
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:36,823
And I guess this man would answer
a question just because I asked.

677
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:39,660
It's because it didn't seem like
the time to be joking around.

678
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:45,165
We are so dead alright.

679
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:48,635
I guess everything that we say is like a
last wish before we die or something.

680
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:56,810
Why don't you both lighten up your faces
already. We won't die on you okay?

681
00:54:57,150 --> 00:55:00,047
Of Course. It's all ready now.

682
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:04,430
Anyhow, do you think there would would be a
hospital with a lab for a PCR test in the vicinity?

683
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:08,355
I heard that the general hospital won't allow you
to do an examination until tomorrow morning or so.

684
00:55:09,770 --> 00:55:12,826
There is a US military base within 20 minutes
from here and they do have one infirmity lab.

685
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:14,530
But I am not so sure if
they will cooperate.

686
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:17,631
-I can take care of that problem.
-I will get the moving vehicle prepared.

687
00:55:36,717 --> 00:55:39,553
Don't worry. A virus
outbreak is our problem too.

688
00:55:42,430 --> 00:55:44,458
His blood pressure and pulse are stable.

689
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:49,229
We did everything we
could do as surgeons.

690
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,534
What do we do now?

691
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:57,237
All we can do now is to
wait for the test result.

692
00:55:57,830 --> 00:56:00,974
That goes for both the
patient and ourselves.

693
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:07,481
The blood sample that you guys gave...

694
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:10,517
It's confirmed to be M3 virus.

695
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:13,720
Are you sure it's the M3 virus?

696
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:15,820
The patient test positive,

697
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:18,959
and one of the two doctors
also tested positive.

698
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:25,365
Who? Which one tested positive?

699
00:56:35,242 --> 00:56:37,811
It really is Blood Diamond after all.

700
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:40,914
I suppose those are real diamonds right?

701
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:44,918
I wonder how much those would cost?

702
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:49,089
We are the only ones who
knows how many there are.

703
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:51,658
Should we each take some?

704
00:56:53,790 --> 00:56:55,395
I didn't see you as that
kind of person though.

705
00:56:58,020 --> 00:56:59,232
You are quite wise.

706
00:57:24,458 --> 00:57:25,459
Are you crazy?

707
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:29,463
Hurry up and leave! I'm on duty right...

708
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:04,598
I guess it's me.

709
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:38,865
There could be a problem due to
the narrowness of the brain.

710
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:40,033
Then what do we do?

711
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:42,580
I think they got the clue about
the tactics of the Americans.

712
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:44,370
I think that they got the grasp
of our strategy as well.

713
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:46,300
The situation that we were worrying
about has just started after all.

714
00:58:46,310 --> 00:58:47,173
Lieutenant Yoon.

715
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:50,043
The vehicle that was bringing
over the medicine were all robbed from what I hear.

716
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:52,245
Please stay with us while
we treat Lieutenant Yoon.

717
00:58:52,510 --> 00:58:55,282
Whoever stole it, we
should catch that bastard.

718
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:58,418
Where is doctor Kang? I don't
seem to see her around anywhere.

719
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:01,922
The cops came by here yesterday and I think
she went to the police station with Patima.

720
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:03,080
What did you just say?

721
00:59:03,090 --> 00:59:05,158
This is Agus. Over.

722
00:59:05,970 --> 00:59:07,160
Let's make a deal.
