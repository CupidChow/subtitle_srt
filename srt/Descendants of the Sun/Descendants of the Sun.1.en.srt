"Demilitarized Zone
Military Demarcation Line"

2
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,635
"680 meter, south side point"

3
00:00:34,577 --> 00:00:36,165
At around 1:20 AM,

4
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,468
three members of the North Korean
special force,

5
00:00:38,597 --> 00:00:40,629
who crossed the Military Demarcation
Line of the Demilitarized Zone,

6
00:00:40,764 --> 00:00:43,697
committed armed trespass into our
military division three border dwelling.

7
00:00:43,893 --> 00:00:47,311
They took hostage of two of our soldiers
who were on guard duty,

8
00:00:47,675 --> 00:00:50,505
and are continuing their
sit-in until this hour.

9
00:00:51,757 --> 00:00:52,756
Sit-in?

10
00:00:53,335 --> 00:00:57,367
Are you trying to start a war,
by sending three special forces?

11
00:00:58,711 --> 00:01:00,634
It is to provoke a provocation.

12
00:01:00,781 --> 00:01:02,201
In the Demilitarized Zone,

13
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:05,828
the side that shoots first
is the one violating the agreement.

14
00:01:06,465 --> 00:01:09,457
Their goal is to provoke our military,

15
00:01:09,839 --> 00:01:10,882
to use military force first,

16
00:01:11,135 --> 00:01:13,523
in order to gain a negotiation card,

17
00:01:14,095 --> 00:01:15,262
at the international treaty.

18
00:01:19,024 --> 00:01:20,949
So, what are we supposed to do?

19
00:01:21,393 --> 00:01:23,513
We can't just fall
for the provocation and attack,

20
00:01:24,063 --> 00:01:26,966
but we have our soldiers held as hostages.

21
00:01:27,097 --> 00:01:29,360
We can't just sit here and watch, right?

22
00:01:29,983 --> 00:01:31,771
We need to return them quietly.

23
00:01:32,913 --> 00:01:36,176
We've dispatched Alpha Team,
from the Special Force.

24
00:01:46,062 --> 00:01:47,712
Halt. State your purpose.

25
00:01:50,223 --> 00:01:52,109
I'm Captain Yoo Shijin of the Alpha Team.

26
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,779
Our Alpha Team will take care of it,

27
00:01:54,394 --> 00:01:56,005
from here on out.

28
00:02:14,685 --> 00:02:15,724
What are you doing right now?

29
00:02:15,832 --> 00:02:17,247
It's the Demilitarized Zone,

30
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,133
so we'll need to resolve this
with South and North dialogue.

31
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:37,287
This is the operation controller!

32
00:02:38,914 --> 00:02:40,914
Are our soldiers inside okay?

33
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,256
Let's stop this now. We'll send you home.

34
00:02:46,382 --> 00:02:48,510
They don't look like they'll leave easily.

35
00:02:49,225 --> 00:02:50,058
Let's go inside.

36
00:02:53,982 --> 00:02:57,196
Big Boss transmitting.
I'm going in with Wolf.

37
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,882
Piccolo transmitting. I have a visual.

38
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:11,326
Snoop transmitting. Explosives in place.

39
00:03:11,433 --> 00:03:13,106
Operation Harry Potter on standby.

40
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:14,941
Explosives?

41
00:03:15,327 --> 00:03:17,033
Then what do we do about those two?

42
00:03:17,133 --> 00:03:19,914
It's our last resort,
in case negotiation fails.

43
00:03:23,643 --> 00:03:26,514
The path is open. Stop this and go back.

44
00:03:28,143 --> 00:03:30,418
The situation will get more complicated
when the sun rises.

45
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:32,432
Leave while we are letting you.

46
00:04:10,593 --> 00:04:11,918
We can't leave that easily.

47
00:04:20,085 --> 00:04:23,116
We need to at least beat up some
South Korean special task soldiers...

48
00:04:23,731 --> 00:04:25,200
...as a warrior of the Republic.

49
00:04:32,044 --> 00:04:32,855
Fine.

50
00:04:34,923 --> 00:04:35,922
Let's fight.

51
00:05:48,714 --> 00:05:51,647
Do you usually hold the knife
with your right hand?

52
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:26,433
Comrade,

53
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,180
you won't be able to kill me.

54
00:07:30,043 --> 00:07:33,387
Given that South Korea
has a lot of eyes on it,

55
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:35,689
you won't be able to shoot first.

56
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:40,106
But we're different.

57
00:07:43,725 --> 00:07:45,107
It's been 70 years since the division,

58
00:07:45,209 --> 00:07:46,524
but there's still a misunderstanding.

59
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,274
If it's to protect our country,

60
00:07:50,522 --> 00:07:52,558
our military will definitely
shoot whenever and wherever.

61
00:08:00,456 --> 00:08:02,245
Let's not make any more mistakes.

62
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:05,465
I won't interfere when an enemy
makes a mistake.

63
00:08:05,914 --> 00:08:07,445
I can't come as a warrior,

64
00:08:07,898 --> 00:08:09,834
but leave as a dead person.

65
00:08:12,253 --> 00:08:13,239
Put it down.

66
00:08:16,985 --> 00:08:19,921
It was nice meeting you,
Captain Yoo Shijin.

67
00:08:20,048 --> 00:08:21,330
Just because it's nice meeting me,

68
00:08:22,426 --> 00:08:24,334
let's not meet annually,

69
00:08:25,124 --> 00:08:26,331
Senior Lieutenant Han Jungjoon.

70
00:08:39,475 --> 00:08:40,299
Let's go.

71
00:08:46,843 --> 00:08:48,007
Big Boss transmitting.

72
00:08:49,172 --> 00:08:52,045
Alpha Team has resolved the situation.

73
00:09:00,148 --> 00:09:07,140
"Descendants Of The Sun
Episode 1"

74
00:09:26,603 --> 00:09:28,291
Did you shoot with your eyes closed?

75
00:09:28,395 --> 00:09:29,946
Your rank is Private.

76
00:09:30,074 --> 00:09:32,799
Don't you think the gun barrel
looks a bit twisted?

77
00:09:32,903 --> 00:09:35,406
I can't adjust the clicker
and the score won't come out properly.

78
00:09:36,162 --> 00:09:37,186
It's rusted.

79
00:09:37,733 --> 00:09:39,026
Are you going to play another round?

80
00:09:39,136 --> 00:09:40,338
This...

81
00:09:40,725 --> 00:09:42,748
Can't the clicker be adjusted?

82
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:46,060
You can't just touch this so carelessly!

83
00:09:46,203 --> 00:09:46,986
This is a copy of the gun,

84
00:09:47,108 --> 00:09:49,898
used by American Delta Force Team
in desert warfare.

85
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,952
So, misters,

86
00:09:51,555 --> 00:09:54,015
if you carelessly use these
like you did in military,

87
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,184
they'll break.

88
00:09:56,031 --> 00:09:57,198
This isn't a gun.

89
00:09:57,994 --> 00:10:01,011
It's a thief! It's a thief! Hey!

90
00:10:01,483 --> 00:10:05,379
Hey! Catch that thief!

91
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,111
The thief is coming this way.

92
00:10:08,087 --> 00:10:09,293
We'll borrow these real quick.

93
00:10:10,823 --> 00:10:13,722
Gosh, we're on our break.

94
00:10:17,025 --> 00:10:18,874
The shooting range is short
because they're toys.

95
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:20,140
About 5 meters.

96
00:10:20,263 --> 00:10:22,157
Currently he's about 10 meters away.

97
00:10:25,514 --> 00:10:26,572
Seven meters.

98
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:29,809
Hey, you there! Move!

99
00:10:29,943 --> 00:10:31,282
Five meters.

100
00:10:35,715 --> 00:10:36,497
Now.

101
00:11:06,073 --> 00:11:07,390
The motorcycle has no problems.

102
00:11:07,947 --> 00:11:08,985
Have you reported it to the police?

103
00:11:09,105 --> 00:11:10,288
It's fine.

104
00:11:10,652 --> 00:11:13,613
It's more of a headache
to call the police over a coupon thief.

105
00:11:13,753 --> 00:11:16,999
Anyway, that friend and I
have nothing to do with each other,

106
00:11:17,123 --> 00:11:19,348
so don't tell me to
come or what not, okay?

107
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:29,455
Hello.

108
00:11:29,566 --> 00:11:31,375
There was a motorcycle accident
and there's a patient.

109
00:11:33,868 --> 00:11:35,669
It's okay. It doesn't hurt.

110
00:11:38,175 --> 00:11:39,396
Lie down.

111
00:11:39,823 --> 00:11:41,157
If you move too much,
your spine might get dislocated,

112
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,681
and you'll suffer
for the rest of your life.

113
00:11:45,657 --> 00:11:47,425
What are you doing right now?

114
00:11:47,787 --> 00:11:50,957
Trying to realize a society of justice
by giving you emergency first aid.

115
00:11:55,261 --> 00:11:57,546
Let me buy two of those stuffed animals
over there.

116
00:11:59,365 --> 00:12:01,307
Those aren't for sale.

117
00:12:01,419 --> 00:12:02,884
Even if they're not, just sell them.

118
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:06,492
Or else I'll take them all.

119
00:12:08,793 --> 00:12:12,412
And lend me a marker if you have one.

120
00:12:13,713 --> 00:12:14,981
A... A marker?

121
00:12:32,256 --> 00:12:34,020
Your girlfriend is very pretty.

122
00:12:34,133 --> 00:12:36,073
It feels like I met my ideal type.

123
00:12:36,773 --> 00:12:38,867
You two look good together.

124
00:12:40,445 --> 00:12:42,505
This one's a fellow soldier.

125
00:12:42,885 --> 00:12:43,945
Exactly...

126
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,137
Why would you accept these, exactly?

127
00:12:48,253 --> 00:12:49,300
Should I not have accepted these,

128
00:12:49,412 --> 00:12:51,519
when he genuinely asked us
to never come again while giving us these?

129
00:12:53,185 --> 00:12:55,821
With such a weak heart,
how are you so hard when it comes to war?

130
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,025
I just don't understand you.

131
00:12:59,923 --> 00:13:01,159
That kid from before,

132
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,776
I wonder if he'll be okay.

133
00:13:02,926 --> 00:13:03,839
From what I saw,

134
00:13:03,966 --> 00:13:05,042
when he was falling from the motorcycle,

135
00:13:05,161 --> 00:13:06,994
he used the lateral drop technique.

136
00:13:07,633 --> 00:13:09,869
He looked like an athlete. He'll be fine.

137
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:13,186
I was that age too.

138
00:13:14,496 --> 00:13:16,980
Athletes need to have the right seniors.

139
00:13:17,492 --> 00:13:19,818
Why? Does it bother you?

140
00:13:20,283 --> 00:13:22,318
Because you remembered your dark past?

141
00:13:23,315 --> 00:13:24,433
It makes me feel sad and a bit bitter.

142
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:30,356
When you were that age,
did you do a lot of bad things?

143
00:13:30,493 --> 00:13:32,073
I made people do bad things.

144
00:13:32,758 --> 00:13:34,794
So you make your noir,

145
00:13:34,963 --> 00:13:36,964
and you make that poor kid a criminal.

146
00:13:37,857 --> 00:13:38,790
Merciless person.

147
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,344
Look at that. Look at you.

148
00:13:47,599 --> 00:13:48,557
Is it the unit?

149
00:13:49,033 --> 00:13:50,276
It is...

150
00:13:52,543 --> 00:13:53,892
...but it's not our unit.

151
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:56,578
-Don't pick up.
-I'm going to pick up.

152
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:58,680
I'm going to pick up and call her here,

153
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,894
so meet her and take care
of business like a man...

154
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,886
-I'll buy you food. Beef.
-Gosh.

155
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:04,931
I make enough money to buy beef.

156
00:14:05,057 --> 00:14:06,525
17 years old liquor.

157
00:14:06,663 --> 00:14:08,019
17 years old?

158
00:14:08,128 --> 00:14:10,573
-It's still a minor!
-Blind date with my cousin,

159
00:14:10,676 --> 00:14:11,334
who works in aircrafts.

160
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:12,350
Is she in the Air Force?

161
00:14:12,463 --> 00:14:13,143
She's a stewardess.

162
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:15,474
There are photos of her
with her stewardess friends on her SNS.

163
00:14:16,344 --> 00:14:19,270
So you've been hiding this desirable
family connection all this time?

164
00:14:19,912 --> 00:14:21,452
Give me your phone already.

165
00:14:22,853 --> 00:14:23,943
Hurry, hurry.

166
00:14:31,551 --> 00:14:33,843
Are you teasing me right now?

167
00:14:34,334 --> 00:14:37,621
Why are you only looking
where there aren't any pockets?

168
00:14:38,683 --> 00:14:39,548
Before...

169
00:14:45,587 --> 00:14:46,421
Are you okay?

170
00:14:50,037 --> 00:14:53,139
Excuse me, is this the patient?

171
00:14:53,783 --> 00:14:56,041
Yes, we did an emergency...

172
00:14:58,128 --> 00:14:59,509
Did you get pickpocketed?

173
00:14:59,612 --> 00:15:02,239
-That kid... Does he want to die?
-You said you pitied him.

174
00:15:02,352 --> 00:15:04,045
Where did they say the hospital was?

175
00:15:10,111 --> 00:15:10,787
What's going on?

176
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:14,691
Take these off. This is so embarrassing.

177
00:15:14,803 --> 00:15:17,722
Don't move.
We'll move him inside like this.

178
00:15:19,302 --> 00:15:20,787
Sir, I said it doesn't hurt.

179
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,798
Really, I'm okay.

180
00:15:22,909 --> 00:15:23,821
Excuse me.

181
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,481
The patient's cell phone.

182
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,917
Yes, thank you for your hard work.

183
00:15:31,132 --> 00:15:33,227
"Yoon Myeongju"

184
00:15:34,102 --> 00:15:35,068
Hello?

185
00:15:35,816 --> 00:15:38,579
No, this is Haesung Hospital's
emergency room.

186
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:41,918
This phone's owner was brought here,
due to a motorcycle accident.

187
00:15:42,354 --> 00:15:43,589
Are you his guardian?

188
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:52,051
This is the motorcycle accident patient.

189
00:15:53,872 --> 00:15:55,164
There's a chart here.

190
00:15:57,452 --> 00:15:58,775
Who wrote this?

191
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:00,728
The ones who made me like this.

192
00:16:01,673 --> 00:16:03,858
Please take this off of me, seriously.

193
00:16:03,983 --> 00:16:06,955
I got it so don't move around.
Please change it into ours.

194
00:16:07,072 --> 00:16:07,696
Yes.

195
00:16:09,183 --> 00:16:11,580
Whoever did the emergency first aid
did an extremely good job.

196
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:13,032
It's very neat and pretty.

197
00:16:14,204 --> 00:16:15,252
Let's see.

198
00:16:15,387 --> 00:16:17,071
Suspected rib fracture...

199
00:16:17,863 --> 00:16:19,363
Your ribs are fractured.

200
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:20,859
Your ankle...

201
00:16:22,998 --> 00:16:24,498
Your ankle is sprained.

202
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:26,966
Are you a thief?

203
00:16:27,173 --> 00:16:27,887
Sorry?

204
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,511
It says so right here.

205
00:16:30,313 --> 00:16:33,595
"Thief. Treat as painfully as possible."

206
00:16:33,913 --> 00:16:36,869
What you saying? I'm the victim.

207
00:16:36,995 --> 00:16:39,400
Take care of the accident
with your insurance company.

208
00:16:39,523 --> 00:16:43,370
We'll have to take an X-ray
to examine your ribs and ankles.

209
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:45,231
Dr. Kang, the director is calling you.

210
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,073
That's right.

211
00:16:46,177 --> 00:16:47,982
-Let me know when the X-ray is done.
-Okay.

212
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,172
Here's your phone.

213
00:16:55,051 --> 00:16:56,743
I answered a call from your guardian.

214
00:16:56,853 --> 00:16:59,855
The X-ray takes a while,
so please wait here.

215
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,907
I totally got screwed over.

216
00:17:18,322 --> 00:17:20,529
I got shot at while trying to run away.

217
00:17:21,954 --> 00:17:23,019
That's not it.

218
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:24,683
It'll take too long to explain.

219
00:17:26,123 --> 00:17:27,097
For now...

220
00:17:27,557 --> 00:17:29,020
Bring the motorcycle here.

221
00:17:31,813 --> 00:17:34,215
I'm finished with the thesis you assigned.

222
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:36,147
You worked hard.

223
00:17:36,924 --> 00:17:39,143
Was it any help to your studies?

224
00:17:39,638 --> 00:17:42,007
Yes. I got a lot of studying done.

225
00:17:43,409 --> 00:17:45,828
You did a good job
with the charts as well.

226
00:17:46,718 --> 00:17:50,115
You only have to do the interview,
in order to become a professor, right?

227
00:17:50,313 --> 00:17:52,482
Yes, I've been getting...

228
00:17:57,156 --> 00:17:58,331
...ready.

229
00:18:01,423 --> 00:18:04,097
I'm sorry. A patient is running away so...

230
00:18:04,263 --> 00:18:07,199
Is he running away without paying
after receiving the treatment?

231
00:18:07,373 --> 00:18:08,825
He didn't even receive treatment,
and he's running away.

232
00:18:08,944 --> 00:18:09,809
If you're done talking...

233
00:18:09,935 --> 00:18:12,672
Go catch him quickly.
He should be treated.

234
00:18:12,802 --> 00:18:14,746
Medicine is a benevolent art after all.

235
00:18:14,846 --> 00:18:16,738
Well then. I'll get going.

236
00:18:19,979 --> 00:18:21,090
Nurse Choi.

237
00:18:21,265 --> 00:18:21,967
Yes?

238
00:18:22,493 --> 00:18:23,867
Where did this patient go?

239
00:18:25,447 --> 00:18:27,098
He was here until just a moment ago.

240
00:18:28,943 --> 00:18:31,279
I said I really have to go.

241
00:18:31,883 --> 00:18:34,840
If I lay down here,
the entire hospital will get loud.

242
00:18:34,983 --> 00:18:36,277
He ran away?

243
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:38,044
You didn't see that?

244
00:18:39,123 --> 00:18:39,917
I'm sorry.

245
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,535
He was almost out of the parking out.

246
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:42,940
Look at his more swollen ankle now.

247
00:18:43,402 --> 00:18:45,335
Gosh, this is so irritating.

248
00:18:46,148 --> 00:18:47,767
If I get caught by my boss,

249
00:18:47,892 --> 00:18:51,149
I won't be laying in this ER,
but in the ICU.

250
00:18:51,963 --> 00:18:54,747
But with what right is this
hospital bringing me back here?

251
00:18:55,147 --> 00:18:57,102
Isn't it up to the customer
to leave or stay?

252
00:18:58,133 --> 00:19:00,838
It's not by right
but by obligation, customer.

253
00:19:01,113 --> 00:19:03,747
If you're going to go,
sign a treatment waiver,

254
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,608
and pay for the treatment
you already received.

255
00:19:05,732 --> 00:19:06,487
Excuse me?

256
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:08,851
Why would I pay money?

257
00:19:08,961 --> 00:19:10,446
I haven't had anything done
since I've gotten here.

258
00:19:10,556 --> 00:19:12,539
You met with a doctor.

259
00:19:12,645 --> 00:19:13,738
You need to pay the consultation fee.

260
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,833
-And if I can't pay?
-We need to call the police.

261
00:19:20,177 --> 00:19:21,561
These people, really...

262
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,372
Okay, fine.

263
00:19:23,471 --> 00:19:24,883
My friend is supposed to come anyway,

264
00:19:24,973 --> 00:19:26,717
so I guess I can just lay down
until he gets here.

265
00:19:27,442 --> 00:19:30,212
The bed is the other way, customer.

266
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:32,922
I'm going to the bathroom.

267
00:19:33,123 --> 00:19:34,319
You expect us to believe that?

268
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,361
I won't skip out
on the hospital fee, okay?

269
00:19:36,722 --> 00:19:38,140
I can just leave
my cell phone with you, right?

270
00:19:39,024 --> 00:19:41,994
They're all over me. Let go of me!

271
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,148
Gosh, they really don't have any manners.

272
00:19:46,623 --> 00:19:49,001
That little punk.

273
00:19:52,871 --> 00:19:56,368
Big Boss? You have got to be kidding  me.

274
00:19:56,497 --> 00:19:59,783
They need to be sent to the military
to get themselves together.

275
00:20:00,135 --> 00:20:01,894
-Let's work.
-Okay.

276
00:20:05,232 --> 00:20:07,175
This punk is still not answering
the phone.

277
00:20:14,457 --> 00:20:15,910
He's dead, if he get caught.

278
00:20:16,053 --> 00:20:20,029
Is that why you tried to figure out
the location of the funeral home?

279
00:20:20,423 --> 00:20:22,464
Gosh, what a meticulous person.

280
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:26,660
The ER is this way.

281
00:20:26,793 --> 00:20:28,210
I am going.

282
00:20:34,646 --> 00:20:36,081
I'm outside. Where are you?

283
00:20:38,984 --> 00:20:39,888
You're here?

284
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,401
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

285
00:21:02,513 --> 00:21:03,751
This will sting.

286
00:21:04,298 --> 00:21:07,134
I am going to suture,
so please prepare 3-0 nylons.

287
00:21:07,312 --> 00:21:07,910
Okay.

288
00:21:11,016 --> 00:21:11,992
Hold on.

289
00:21:14,168 --> 00:21:15,229
Hello.

290
00:21:19,872 --> 00:21:20,705
Hello.

291
00:21:30,149 --> 00:21:31,355
Big Boss?

292
00:21:32,308 --> 00:21:33,160
Yes.

293
00:21:34,014 --> 00:21:36,265
But why do you have that phone?

294
00:21:36,513 --> 00:21:38,577
The patient left his phone with me.

295
00:21:39,351 --> 00:21:40,347
Are you his guardian?

296
00:21:40,474 --> 00:21:41,862
I'm not the patient's guardian,

297
00:21:42,164 --> 00:21:43,402
but I'm the guardian of the phone's owner.

298
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:44,904
You don't feel any sensation, right?

299
00:21:45,311 --> 00:21:46,560
We'll wrap it up now.

300
00:21:49,694 --> 00:21:51,300
Where did
the motorcycle accident patient go?

301
00:21:53,163 --> 00:21:54,349
Why is he not here?

302
00:21:55,075 --> 00:21:56,527
Did he go to the X-ray room?

303
00:22:01,774 --> 00:22:03,679
Who am I speaking with right now?

304
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,195
Are you perhaps...

305
00:22:05,584 --> 00:22:07,797
...the people who wanted
to send him to the mortuary?

306
00:22:07,928 --> 00:22:09,495
Are you talking about the mortuary?

307
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,075
There seems to be
some kind of misunderstanding...

308
00:22:13,186 --> 00:22:16,693
Nurse Choi, tell these
men to go wait outside.

309
00:22:16,978 --> 00:22:17,851
Let the security team know,

310
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:19,706
and tell them to make sure
they aren't causing any trouble.

311
00:22:23,373 --> 00:22:24,367
Now.

312
00:22:24,653 --> 00:22:26,645
You can't be here. Please wait over there.

313
00:22:26,764 --> 00:22:27,713
Wait...

314
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:28,973
Hurry.

315
00:22:53,384 --> 00:22:56,160
Judging from the way he left my phone,
I think he ran away.

316
00:22:57,716 --> 00:23:00,436
Yes, it does seem like he ran away.

317
00:23:00,835 --> 00:23:02,240
We should go look for him outside.

318
00:23:02,899 --> 00:23:04,266
He couldn't have gone far.

319
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,193
Yes, he couldn't have gone far.

320
00:23:08,232 --> 00:23:09,847
You should go ahead quickly .

321
00:23:21,253 --> 00:23:22,105
My stomach!

322
00:23:23,393 --> 00:23:24,639
My stomach is suddenly...

323
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,829
I think it's my appendix.

324
00:23:26,143 --> 00:23:28,163
-The appendix isn't over there.
-Right, it's over here.

325
00:23:28,993 --> 00:23:30,023
What's wrong with me?

326
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,761
You were correct.
The appendix was on that side.

327
00:23:38,852 --> 00:23:40,587
This guy really wishes to die.

328
00:23:41,968 --> 00:23:42,834
Let's go.

329
00:23:45,604 --> 00:23:46,936
They look like gangsters, right?

330
00:23:47,503 --> 00:23:49,140
The boss and the big boss.

331
00:23:51,215 --> 00:23:53,145
Was I being too harsh on them?

332
00:23:53,805 --> 00:23:56,731
Don't worry.
I use knives better than them.

333
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:03,491
Do you know where you're going?

334
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,235
I do have a place in mind.

335
00:24:05,594 --> 00:24:07,745
There were guys looking like gangsters...

336
00:24:22,873 --> 00:24:24,641
Do you really need to find your phone?

337
00:24:25,371 --> 00:24:27,121
It seems like they can fight well.

338
00:24:27,344 --> 00:24:29,061
There is a reason that I must find it.

339
00:24:29,924 --> 00:24:30,640
Why?

340
00:24:32,233 --> 00:24:34,608
Is there something in the phone?

341
00:24:36,128 --> 00:24:37,429
You aren't very honorable.

342
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:38,566
Is it a good one?

343
00:24:38,828 --> 00:24:39,533
Yes.

344
00:24:41,453 --> 00:24:43,766
Hey, you gangsters over there!

345
00:24:44,322 --> 00:24:46,826
Everybody, stop what you are doing!

346
00:24:47,389 --> 00:24:49,200
Who are you guys?

347
00:24:49,301 --> 00:24:51,309
Just keep going where you were going.

348
00:24:51,566 --> 00:24:54,263
Don't try to act tough.

349
00:24:56,373 --> 00:24:58,167
We have some business with him.

350
00:24:58,286 --> 00:24:59,627
Then, get in line.

351
00:24:59,997 --> 00:25:01,845
You fools.

352
00:25:05,173 --> 00:25:06,879
Please save me this once.

353
00:25:07,992 --> 00:25:08,720
Hey,

354
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,727
did you perhaps steal their phone as well?

355
00:25:13,926 --> 00:25:14,924
What is the reason?

356
00:25:15,133 --> 00:25:16,124
Why are they hitting you?

357
00:25:16,276 --> 00:25:18,005
Please save me this once...

358
00:25:18,563 --> 00:25:21,005
I'll return your phone right away.

359
00:25:21,464 --> 00:25:22,201
Hey.

360
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:25,038
Look at the number of them.

361
00:25:25,744 --> 00:25:28,122
Is this what you consider a fair trade?

362
00:25:28,439 --> 00:25:30,979
Since Gibeom wants to leave the circle,

363
00:25:31,089 --> 00:25:32,672
they said he has to pay
the withdrawal fee.

364
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,684
It's five million won.

365
00:25:35,273 --> 00:25:36,452
Withdrawal fee?

366
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:37,839
Well...

367
00:25:38,193 --> 00:25:40,407
Is this normal in the dark sides?

368
00:25:41,209 --> 00:25:42,846
Everything is expensive nowadays.

369
00:25:44,065 --> 00:25:45,867
So, you were one of us.

370
00:25:46,575 --> 00:25:48,447
You'll find nothing if you search him.

371
00:25:48,877 --> 00:25:50,487
Should you and I settle this instead?

372
00:25:50,595 --> 00:25:52,909
That's a good idea. Settle it with me.

373
00:25:53,471 --> 00:25:55,348
If money is the issue,
let's settle it with money.

374
00:25:57,301 --> 00:25:58,693
I have quite a lot of money.

375
00:25:59,049 --> 00:26:01,081
Whoever has confidence,
come and take this wallet.

376
00:26:01,212 --> 00:26:02,255
Then, I'll give it all to you.

377
00:26:02,747 --> 00:26:04,374
-Really?
-For real?

378
00:26:04,548 --> 00:26:05,867
Stay out of this.

379
00:26:06,576 --> 00:26:07,375
Yes.

380
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,751
I'm his brother.

381
00:26:11,722 --> 00:26:12,722
What's your name?

382
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,862
Gibeom. Kim Gibeom.

383
00:26:16,515 --> 00:26:17,608
I am Gibeom's brother.

384
00:26:18,733 --> 00:26:21,217
If you take this wallet,
I'll give you the withdrawal fee.

385
00:26:21,416 --> 00:26:22,250
Try and take it.

386
00:26:26,953 --> 00:26:28,767
You're dead, if it's an empty wallet.

387
00:26:50,468 --> 00:26:52,197
You even carry around this knife?

388
00:26:55,852 --> 00:26:57,035
This won't do.

389
00:26:57,225 --> 00:26:58,523
They're useless gangsters.

390
00:26:59,332 --> 00:27:00,415
Let's break them up.

391
00:27:02,848 --> 00:27:04,403
Everyone with knives,
take out all your knives.

392
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:06,162
Everyone with guns,
take out all your guns.

393
00:27:06,436 --> 00:27:07,578
Bring it on.

394
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:08,570
Hey.

395
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:10,769
If you look at the numbers, we'll win.

396
00:27:11,368 --> 00:27:12,584
Take out all your knives.

397
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,409
Why did you say such nonsense?

398
00:27:23,752 --> 00:27:25,081
I'm regretting it.

399
00:27:26,375 --> 00:27:28,069
At least there aren't any guns.

400
00:27:28,178 --> 00:27:29,486
Get them!

401
00:27:35,308 --> 00:27:36,729
Doctor, please look at this.

402
00:27:37,124 --> 00:27:38,792
There seems to be a problem with the lung.

403
00:27:43,443 --> 00:27:45,029
That motorbike accident patient,

404
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,563
I believe that he ran away again.

405
00:27:49,849 --> 00:27:50,943
His guardian came.

406
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:51,921
Again?

407
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:54,011
Where is his guardian?

408
00:28:08,642 --> 00:28:09,863
Yoon Myeongju?

409
00:28:13,335 --> 00:28:14,905
Kang Moyeon?

410
00:28:16,742 --> 00:28:18,838
Are you this patient's guardian?

411
00:28:18,949 --> 00:28:20,444
Are you his attending physician?

412
00:28:21,131 --> 00:28:22,324
Where is the patient?

413
00:28:22,926 --> 00:28:24,703
Let me see his chart first.

414
00:28:25,594 --> 00:28:26,567
Coming into someone else's hospital,

415
00:28:26,696 --> 00:28:28,458
why would you look at
someone else's patient's chart?

416
00:28:29,215 --> 00:28:30,384
It seems that,

417
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:32,503
there must be a man in the middle
for us to meet.

418
00:28:32,623 --> 00:28:34,564
I don't have time to joke around with you.

419
00:28:34,686 --> 00:28:36,131
Just give me the chart.

420
00:28:36,602 --> 00:28:38,162
To me, he's an important person.

421
00:28:39,858 --> 00:28:40,766
An important person?

422
00:28:40,906 --> 00:28:42,131
Is he badly hurt?

423
00:28:43,183 --> 00:28:45,702
How can the attending physician
not know that her patient ran away?

424
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:47,515
Where did the patient go?

425
00:28:48,623 --> 00:28:50,352
That's what I want to ask.

426
00:28:50,749 --> 00:28:52,566
It seems that
this important person of yours,

427
00:28:52,678 --> 00:28:54,326
left the hospital without even paying.

428
00:28:54,824 --> 00:28:55,971
Since you're here,

429
00:28:56,074 --> 00:28:57,876
do you want to pay for his medical bills?

430
00:28:58,748 --> 00:28:59,932
Call the security team,

431
00:29:00,041 --> 00:29:01,969
and tell them to search
the men's bathroom.

432
00:29:02,105 --> 00:29:02,895
And even if they can't find him,

433
00:29:03,006 --> 00:29:05,459
make sure you receive the payment
from his guardian over here.

434
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,413
How can you just leave like this?

435
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:11,925
Talk with Nurse Choi.

436
00:29:12,461 --> 00:29:15,268
If we captured twice,
a patient who doesn't want to be treated,

437
00:29:15,383 --> 00:29:17,200
I think that the hospital
has done their best.

438
00:29:17,668 --> 00:29:18,813
I need to go since I'm busy.

439
00:29:23,245 --> 00:29:24,554
Where is the men's bathroom?

440
00:29:24,932 --> 00:29:25,700
It's over there.

441
00:29:26,928 --> 00:29:28,141
Amazing.

442
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:30,243
Yoon Myeongju is in ER right now.

443
00:29:30,338 --> 00:29:31,432
Yoon Myeongju?

444
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:32,808
Military Academy graduate, Yoon Myeongju?

445
00:29:32,943 --> 00:29:35,132
Yes, that girl who received
commissioned education or whatever,

446
00:29:35,252 --> 00:29:37,156
the rude girl who interned with us!

447
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:38,000
I know.

448
00:29:38,127 --> 00:29:39,238
That pretty army surgeon, Yoon Myeongju,

449
00:29:39,357 --> 00:29:41,309
who stole the senior you had a crush on.

450
00:29:42,035 --> 00:29:42,876
Hey.

451
00:29:43,058 --> 00:29:45,178
Who are you saying is pretty?

452
00:29:45,278 --> 00:29:46,481
You're pretty if your eyes are big?

453
00:29:46,574 --> 00:29:47,558
You're pretty if your nose is high?

454
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:49,681
If you have a face well put together,
you're pretty?

455
00:29:49,847 --> 00:29:51,257
Hey, that's all because of makeup.

456
00:29:51,355 --> 00:29:53,339
-She's pretty even without makeup.
-Even without makeup...

457
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:57,736
That senior and Yoon Myeongju
didn't go out.

458
00:29:57,886 --> 00:29:59,791
Enough about the past.

459
00:29:59,902 --> 00:30:01,523
But why the emergency room?
Did she get hurt?

460
00:30:01,749 --> 00:30:04,381
No, her boyfriend is hurt.

461
00:30:04,501 --> 00:30:06,199
But no matter how you look at him,

462
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:08,104
the oldest his boyfriend can be
is 20 years old.

463
00:30:08,229 --> 00:30:09,223
Isn't she crazy?

464
00:30:09,329 --> 00:30:11,923
What are you talking about?
Myeongju's boyfriend is a soldier.

465
00:30:12,607 --> 00:30:13,721
What do you mean a soldier?

466
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:15,713
-His hair is long.
-He is a soldier.

467
00:30:15,825 --> 00:30:19,448
Her love story is very famous
among her comrades.

468
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:20,954
Myeongju's boyfriend
is a non-commissioned officer.

469
00:30:21,109 --> 00:30:22,162
Non-commissioned officer?

470
00:30:22,807 --> 00:30:23,838
What is that?

471
00:30:24,621 --> 00:30:25,735
Among military ranks,

472
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:28,438
there are staff sergeant,
first class sergeant and master sergeant.

473
00:30:28,585 --> 00:30:31,247
You're the weird one
for knowing that stuff.

474
00:30:31,355 --> 00:30:33,450
Anyhow, Myeongju's boyfriend
is a sergeant major.

475
00:30:33,553 --> 00:30:35,011
He went to college through
General Equivalency Diploma.

476
00:30:35,348 --> 00:30:37,350
But Myeongju is Military Academy graduate
commissioned officer.

477
00:30:37,467 --> 00:30:38,473
And she's an army surgeon.

478
00:30:38,585 --> 00:30:40,179
Her dad is a three-star general.

479
00:30:40,315 --> 00:30:42,026
Is there any chance
their relationship can work out?

480
00:30:42,855 --> 00:30:43,720
Is that so?

481
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:49,635
Then, who's the one
who left his phone and ran away?

482
00:30:57,142 --> 00:30:58,425
What happened to this patient?

483
00:30:59,005 --> 00:31:01,402
Nurse Choi! Call Dr. Kang, hurry!

484
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,446
There was a little accident.

485
00:31:14,358 --> 00:31:15,363
What happened?

486
00:31:17,306 --> 00:31:19,101
I heard that you got hurt,
but you're fine.

487
00:31:21,241 --> 00:31:22,096
Follow me.

488
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:34,251
What happened to this patient?
Why is he like this?

489
00:31:34,386 --> 00:31:35,665
Something happened.

490
00:31:35,998 --> 00:31:37,995
An unsavory accident.

491
00:31:38,212 --> 00:31:40,228
This isn't an accident. It's an assault.

492
00:31:40,807 --> 00:31:43,117
How can two adults do this to a kid?

493
00:31:43,225 --> 00:31:44,459
What are you talking about?

494
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,949
Sir, who did this to you?

495
00:31:47,085 --> 00:31:48,449
Did this person do this to you?

496
00:31:48,825 --> 00:31:50,125
That's not it.

497
00:31:50,529 --> 00:31:52,229
He saved me.

498
00:31:52,692 --> 00:31:55,822
Sir, this is the hospital, so it's okay.

499
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:59,248
We have a security team,
so you can tell the truth.

500
00:31:59,395 --> 00:32:00,850
Did this person hit you?

501
00:32:01,037 --> 00:32:05,168
Gosh. I said he's not the one who hit me.

502
00:32:08,881 --> 00:32:10,521
No matter how many times he says no,

503
00:32:11,227 --> 00:32:12,313
you're not going to believe him, right?

504
00:32:17,929 --> 00:32:21,672
I'll give you painkillers.
You'll also take full body X-ray.

505
00:32:22,288 --> 00:32:23,716
Nurse Ha, after his dressing...

506
00:32:23,843 --> 00:32:26,462
Don't worry. I'll take him there myself.

507
00:32:26,925 --> 00:32:28,369
Nurse Choi, please call the security room.

508
00:32:28,472 --> 00:32:30,019
Tell them we'll go there
to check the CCTV.

509
00:32:30,185 --> 00:32:31,687
I'll call the police.

510
00:32:34,491 --> 00:32:36,192
Excuse me, wait a minute!

511
00:32:37,502 --> 00:32:39,696
Excuse me, wait a minute!

512
00:32:43,217 --> 00:32:44,156
Move.

513
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,745
I'll move, after we clear
this misunderstanding.

514
00:32:48,676 --> 00:32:50,756
Everything that kid said is true.

515
00:32:50,875 --> 00:32:53,450
-That kid...
-Is that patient your kid?

516
00:33:01,323 --> 00:33:02,812
Your patient,

517
00:33:03,386 --> 00:33:07,087
stole my comrade's phone,
so we came to find his phone.

518
00:33:07,851 --> 00:33:10,275
He was beaten up by a gang,
so we saved him.

519
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:13,002
You saved the thief who stole the phone?

520
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:16,447
It's more convincing
if you were the assailant.

521
00:33:19,933 --> 00:33:21,180
Is this the police?

522
00:33:21,292 --> 00:33:22,680
This is Haesung Hospital's emergency...

523
00:33:39,123 --> 00:33:40,781
"Emergency number"

524
00:33:42,664 --> 00:33:43,866
What do you think you are doing?

525
00:33:43,973 --> 00:33:45,469
I'll tell you straightforwardly.

526
00:33:46,694 --> 00:33:48,418
Police can be a bit of a problem.

527
00:33:49,237 --> 00:33:50,137
Right?

528
00:33:51,441 --> 00:33:52,654
Give me my phone.

529
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:57,455
Actually, we're soldiers.

530
00:33:57,650 --> 00:33:59,328
We're soldiers on leave.

531
00:33:59,768 --> 00:34:02,364
It can be troublesome,
if an assault case is known reported.

532
00:34:02,535 --> 00:34:04,292
We'd have to write reports here and there.

533
00:34:05,441 --> 00:34:06,910
I ask for your cooperation.

534
00:34:07,486 --> 00:34:09,337
Why should I cooperate with you?

535
00:34:09,751 --> 00:34:12,014
What's there to know
if you're a soldier or not?

536
00:34:12,495 --> 00:34:14,038
Give my phone back.

537
00:34:18,845 --> 00:34:22,236
Every South Korean men have this,
so you won't believe me.

538
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:29,036
If you say this is forged,
there's nothing I can say.

539
00:34:30,349 --> 00:34:31,536
What college did you graduate from?

540
00:34:32,725 --> 00:34:33,903
This is Haesung Hospital,

541
00:34:34,041 --> 00:34:35,314
so did you graduate
from Myeongin University?

542
00:34:35,896 --> 00:34:36,816
Why are you asking that?

543
00:34:36,933 --> 00:34:38,542
Do you know Yoon Myeongju by chance?

544
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,309
You two should be from the same class.

545
00:34:43,374 --> 00:34:44,783
How do you know her?

546
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,179
Are you,

547
00:34:50,372 --> 00:34:52,372
staff sergeant or first class sergeant
or master sergeant,

548
00:34:52,872 --> 00:34:54,007
or something like that...

549
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:55,664
-Peace officer.
-Yes, that's right.

550
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:56,972
Peace officer.

551
00:34:58,401 --> 00:34:59,448
Are you that person?

552
00:35:02,469 --> 00:35:05,331
I'm not that person,
but let's go together.

553
00:35:06,803 --> 00:35:08,530
Someone will confirm my identity.

554
00:35:15,085 --> 00:35:16,864
It's been a very long time.

555
00:35:17,608 --> 00:35:18,644
Yes, that's right.

556
00:35:20,381 --> 00:35:25,056
It must have been hard to avoid me,
but you look good.

557
00:35:25,505 --> 00:35:26,540
Yes, that's right.

558
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:30,339
When will we be able to remove honorifics
and speak casually?

559
00:35:32,476 --> 00:35:34,761
You won't speak to me,
if we don't use honorifics?

560
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:35,761
Yes, that's right.

561
00:35:35,873 --> 00:35:37,775
I'll really kill you.

562
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,714
How long are you going to avoid me?

563
00:35:40,258 --> 00:35:42,159
Why won't you pick up my calls?

564
00:35:43,529 --> 00:35:45,688
Why won't you even let me
confirm your safety?

565
00:35:47,553 --> 00:35:49,498
When will you stop running away?

566
00:35:52,037 --> 00:35:53,121
Answer me.

567
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:55,806
It's not like I don't know the reason.

568
00:35:57,607 --> 00:35:58,472
I just...

569
00:36:00,615 --> 00:36:02,369
...want to hear your voice.

570
00:36:04,447 --> 00:36:07,091
It's not the reason that you think of.

571
00:36:08,934 --> 00:36:12,363
I hope you don't think
I left on your behalf.

572
00:36:14,186 --> 00:36:15,505
I had a change of heart.

573
00:36:17,915 --> 00:36:20,154
There is nothing to explain
the change of heart.

574
00:36:22,531 --> 00:36:23,558
That's it.

575
00:36:24,924 --> 00:36:25,911
I don't believe you.

576
00:36:26,249 --> 00:36:28,439
-I'll get going,
-Don't do that.

577
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:29,558
if we're done here.

578
00:36:31,757 --> 00:36:34,235
Don't you dare. Stay there.

579
00:36:34,934 --> 00:36:36,345
Seo Daeyeong, stay there.

580
00:36:37,539 --> 00:36:38,790
Sergeant Major Seo.

581
00:36:39,932 --> 00:36:42,234
You're leaving
without saluting your superior?

582
00:37:09,624 --> 00:37:10,842
Stand right there.

583
00:37:12,211 --> 00:37:13,510
Stand there the whole night.

584
00:37:14,672 --> 00:37:16,083
Stand there until you die.

585
00:37:18,601 --> 00:37:20,480
I'm never going to receive
your allegiance.

586
00:37:33,404 --> 00:37:34,197
You little...

587
00:37:35,577 --> 00:37:37,091
You're inflicting cruel treatment.

588
00:37:37,204 --> 00:37:39,124
It's a moral education
for a coward soldier.

589
00:37:40,584 --> 00:37:41,673
What do you need?

590
00:37:43,054 --> 00:37:44,234
I'm an unidentified soldier,

591
00:37:44,346 --> 00:37:45,483
in need of my honor to be restored.

592
00:37:47,052 --> 00:37:49,933
You need to verify our identity
to this person here.

593
00:37:50,041 --> 00:37:51,784
She's not going to believe me.

594
00:37:52,644 --> 00:37:54,654
It's better to trust an acquaintance
over a stranger.

595
00:37:54,758 --> 00:37:55,779
So, tell me.

596
00:37:56,755 --> 00:37:57,756
Is that right?

597
00:37:59,534 --> 00:38:02,761
Then, report these two people
to the police.

598
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:04,888
They're runaway soldiers.

599
00:38:08,062 --> 00:38:09,330
Hey, you punk!

600
00:38:11,648 --> 00:38:13,251
Please give me back my cellphone.

601
00:38:13,368 --> 00:38:15,003
Your identity has been confirmed.

602
00:38:15,564 --> 00:38:16,559
Please return it to him.

603
00:38:19,421 --> 00:38:20,588
Now that it has come to this,

604
00:38:21,176 --> 00:38:23,588
I'm going to investigate this phone later.

605
00:38:27,206 --> 00:38:28,331
Is our misunderstanding resolved now?

606
00:38:28,432 --> 00:38:29,751
Only your identity has been confirmed.

607
00:38:29,886 --> 00:38:31,433
The assault is another case.

608
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:32,508
Follow me.

609
00:38:37,878 --> 00:38:39,994
It'll take about five minutes
to find the footage.

610
00:38:40,282 --> 00:38:42,080
-Please wait here.
-Okay.

611
00:39:10,247 --> 00:39:13,251
How do you know Myeongju?

612
00:39:15,172 --> 00:39:16,899
She was my junior at the Military Academy.

613
00:39:19,005 --> 00:39:21,914
My identity was verified.
Must you confirm this too?

614
00:39:22,969 --> 00:39:24,831
I don't look like I'm good at lying.

615
00:39:25,856 --> 00:39:27,925
Murderers generally give off a good vibe.

616
00:39:32,118 --> 00:39:33,959
It seems so.

617
00:39:35,886 --> 00:39:37,797
I'll get scared,
if you suddenly become serious.

618
00:39:37,935 --> 00:39:39,512
It's just the two of us here.

619
00:39:39,852 --> 00:39:41,195
Don't worry.

620
00:39:41,621 --> 00:39:44,179
Protecting beauties, elders and children,

621
00:39:44,359 --> 00:39:45,255
is my rule.

622
00:39:45,389 --> 00:39:48,739
That's a relief,
since I fit into one of those categories.

623
00:39:49,118 --> 00:39:51,586
-No, you don't.
-The elders category.

624
00:39:59,737 --> 00:40:03,562
Big Boss, what’s your name?

625
00:40:04,279 --> 00:40:07,101
I'm Yoo Shijin. And you?

626
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:09,885
I'm Kang Moyeon.

627
00:40:13,137 --> 00:40:14,071
Nice to meet you.

628
00:40:15,664 --> 00:40:17,215
Don't act friendly.

629
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:43,458
I think you just made eye contact with me.

630
00:40:47,065 --> 00:40:48,176
What sport did you do?

631
00:40:50,175 --> 00:40:53,190
I did judo until my junior year.

632
00:40:55,427 --> 00:40:57,224
Why didn't you fight back?

633
00:40:58,897 --> 00:41:00,585
So that it will end sooner.

634
00:41:03,986 --> 00:41:07,295
But, how did you know I was an athlete?

635
00:41:08,638 --> 00:41:10,086
Your position when you were getting hit.

636
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,674
You learn how to get hit first
before you hit.

637
00:41:14,566 --> 00:41:16,261
I did taekwondo.

638
00:41:18,126 --> 00:41:19,278
Since elementary school.

639
00:41:19,762 --> 00:41:20,720
Were you any good?

640
00:41:21,904 --> 00:41:22,554
Well...

641
00:41:22,732 --> 00:41:24,541
I won gold medals...

642
00:41:26,112 --> 00:41:26,759
And...

643
00:41:27,494 --> 00:41:29,914
Mr. Kim Gibeom, is your guardian here yet?

644
00:41:30,033 --> 00:41:31,294
Your hospitalization documents
need to be completed.

645
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,291
I told you I didn't have a guardian.

646
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:34,972
He has a guardian.

647
00:41:42,283 --> 00:41:43,251
My gosh!

648
00:41:46,365 --> 00:41:47,191
My goodness!

649
00:41:59,464 --> 00:42:00,691
That's right, just like that!

650
00:42:03,955 --> 00:42:04,990
That's right.

651
00:42:07,653 --> 00:42:10,075
That's right!

652
00:42:22,354 --> 00:42:23,467
Good job!

653
00:42:27,022 --> 00:42:28,738
Now I know what happened.

654
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:30,545
I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.

655
00:42:31,959 --> 00:42:33,228
If you're really sorry,

656
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,506
can you treat me?

657
00:42:34,634 --> 00:42:36,011
I really do have somewhere that hurts.

658
00:42:36,798 --> 00:42:38,194
Where are you hurt?

659
00:42:39,715 --> 00:42:40,516
Here.

660
00:42:42,774 --> 00:42:43,699
Here?

661
00:42:46,175 --> 00:42:48,134
You're exaggerating.

662
00:42:49,044 --> 00:42:50,286
I'm not exaggerating.

663
00:42:57,394 --> 00:42:58,227
My goodness.

664
00:43:04,365 --> 00:43:07,479
It looks like your stitches opened up
from the fight earlier.

665
00:43:07,928 --> 00:43:09,261
When did you get hurt?

666
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:13,158
It's been a few days.

667
00:43:13,702 --> 00:43:15,161
How did you get hurt?

668
00:43:16,613 --> 00:43:18,271
While I was shoveling at my base.

669
00:43:19,247 --> 00:43:20,967
Soldiers are ought to shovel.

670
00:43:21,454 --> 00:43:22,577
Is that right?

671
00:43:23,287 --> 00:43:24,972
What a strange base.

672
00:43:25,163 --> 00:43:26,775
Getting shot while shoveling.

673
00:43:27,668 --> 00:43:29,097
Isn't this a gunshot wound?

674
00:43:30,838 --> 00:43:33,398
You've seen a gunshot wound before?

675
00:43:33,525 --> 00:43:35,167
I haven't seen one in Korea,

676
00:43:35,322 --> 00:43:37,732
but did see it in Africa,
when I did volunteer work.

677
00:43:42,714 --> 00:43:44,369
I'm saying this since you already know,

678
00:43:45,404 --> 00:43:48,700
but this is actually
a scar from Normandy.

679
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:53,906
Back then, the bullets
were pouring like rain.

680
00:43:54,295 --> 00:43:56,605
I went through them
to save my fellow solider.

681
00:43:56,962 --> 00:43:57,730
I did that.

682
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:02,623
Was that solider's name,
Private Ryan by any chance?

683
00:44:10,958 --> 00:44:12,358
The suture is done.

684
00:44:12,541 --> 00:44:14,612
The stitches can be removed after a week,

685
00:44:14,716 --> 00:44:17,517
but you'll need
to have them sterilized by then.

686
00:44:17,854 --> 00:44:20,323
-There's a hospital in the army, right?
-Can I come here instead?

687
00:44:21,908 --> 00:44:23,750
-Isn't this hospital far?
-It is.

688
00:44:24,914 --> 00:44:26,121
Can I come everyday?

689
00:44:26,242 --> 00:44:27,512
That's too much.

690
00:44:27,622 --> 00:44:28,675
If you come three times a week,

691
00:44:28,893 --> 00:44:31,516
or four times a week,
you'll get better quickly.

692
00:44:32,949 --> 00:44:34,132
Are you agreeing to be my doctor?

693
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:35,259
Is the doctor important,

694
00:44:35,371 --> 00:44:36,894
when you're just
getting your wound sterilized?

695
00:44:38,238 --> 00:44:39,362
It's important.

696
00:44:40,839 --> 00:44:43,766
Especially the doctor's beauty.

697
00:44:46,634 --> 00:44:48,729
If beauty is the standard
for choosing a doctor,

698
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,536
then there is no better choice.

699
00:44:51,064 --> 00:44:52,054
I'll make you an appointment.

700
00:44:52,197 --> 00:44:53,349
Come at 2 PM.

701
00:44:59,006 --> 00:45:00,866
You're a doctor, so I think
you don't have a boyfriend.

702
00:45:01,197 --> 00:45:02,229
Because you're busy.

703
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,930
You're a soldier, so I think
you don't have a girlfriend.

704
00:45:07,724 --> 00:45:08,749
Because your job is hard.

705
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:12,736
Who should answer the question?

706
00:45:38,672 --> 00:45:39,472
Sergeant Major.

707
00:45:39,799 --> 00:45:42,235
Is this one better or this one?

708
00:45:42,354 --> 00:45:44,556
-Please show me the right one again.
-This one?

709
00:45:45,077 --> 00:45:47,361
Where are you going, dressing up?

710
00:45:47,754 --> 00:45:49,962
I’m going to Haesung Hospital
the day after tomorrow.

711
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:50,698
To get my wound cleaned.

712
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:51,965
Medical corp is right in front here,

713
00:45:52,068 --> 00:45:54,712
but he insists on traveling
for an hour and a half to clean his wound.

714
00:45:55,922 --> 00:45:57,601
Physical strength means national strength.

715
00:45:57,752 --> 00:45:59,179
I need to receive my treatment,

716
00:45:59,283 --> 00:46:01,925
at the hospital
with the best facilities in Korea,

717
00:46:02,454 --> 00:46:03,642
so I can have the strong body and mind,

718
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:05,537
to defend the motherland.

719
00:46:06,624 --> 00:46:08,158
The doctor must be pretty.

720
00:46:09,726 --> 00:46:11,448
There are no pretty doctors
at the army hospital.

721
00:46:11,565 --> 00:46:12,574
There is.

722
00:46:13,554 --> 00:46:14,297
I know who it is.

723
00:46:14,384 --> 00:46:16,027
Are you talking about
Lieutenant Yoon Myeongju?

724
00:46:16,789 --> 00:46:18,722
She is very pretty.

725
00:46:19,314 --> 00:46:21,837
But she was dumped harshly
by the guy that she was dating.

726
00:46:21,954 --> 00:46:25,171
Whoever that bastard is,
I want to see his face.

727
00:46:28,157 --> 00:46:29,504
Why are you guys doing this?

728
00:46:29,654 --> 00:46:30,414
You punk.

729
00:46:31,417 --> 00:46:34,186
Why are you risking your life
for your curiosity?

730
00:46:35,827 --> 00:46:38,374
Did I change something?

731
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:41,778
I am going to Haesung Hospital
the day after tomorrow too.

732
00:46:42,524 --> 00:46:43,738
Please give me a ride.

733
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:46,044
Why are you going there?

734
00:46:49,314 --> 00:46:51,329
The hospitalization fees are settled.

735
00:46:51,727 --> 00:46:52,409
My goodness.

736
00:46:52,526 --> 00:46:54,428
It's not like soldiers get paid that well.

737
00:46:57,154 --> 00:46:58,392
Take care of your body well.

738
00:46:58,504 --> 00:47:01,574
If you're going to do something bad,
don't do it in front of me.

739
00:47:04,252 --> 00:47:05,640
I'm going to get my treatment.

740
00:47:10,428 --> 00:47:11,689
Make sure to take your medicine.

741
00:47:12,397 --> 00:47:14,220
Eat before you take your medicine.

742
00:47:15,084 --> 00:47:17,135
I'm thankful that you paid for me,

743
00:47:18,227 --> 00:47:19,436
but I can't pay you back.

744
00:47:20,434 --> 00:47:21,799
Don’t use this as an excuse,

745
00:47:21,899 --> 00:47:24,391
-to try to teach me life lessons...
-I don't plan on preaching.

746
00:47:25,081 --> 00:47:25,797
Go.

747
00:47:26,287 --> 00:47:27,001
I'm leaving.

748
00:47:28,394 --> 00:47:29,231
Wait.

749
00:47:33,322 --> 00:47:34,942
I'm sorry...

750
00:47:37,292 --> 00:47:38,403
...for stealing your phone.

751
00:47:38,709 --> 00:47:40,449
Okay, I got it.

752
00:47:42,054 --> 00:47:43,441
Wait.

753
00:47:47,201 --> 00:47:48,540
Getting beat up doesn't work,

754
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:50,691
giving them money doesn't either...

755
00:47:52,312 --> 00:47:53,190
How did you...

756
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:56,233
...escape from them?

757
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,238
I escaped to somewhere
they can never follow me to.

758
00:48:04,078 --> 00:48:05,849
Where is that?

759
00:48:15,364 --> 00:48:16,875
Please get out of the way!

760
00:48:17,354 --> 00:48:19,467
Nurse Ha, we probably need more blood.

761
00:48:19,581 --> 00:48:21,292
I'll prepare five more bags for now.

762
00:48:23,082 --> 00:48:24,501
Please move!

763
00:48:26,718 --> 00:48:28,154
What are you doing? Increase the speed!

764
00:48:43,522 --> 00:48:44,949
"Operation room"

765
00:48:48,061 --> 00:48:51,659
"Operation room"

766
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:01,668
"Operating surgeon: Kang Moyeon"

767
00:50:02,904 --> 00:50:03,720
Hello.

768
00:50:04,212 --> 00:50:05,438
Mr. Yoo Shijin?

769
00:50:06,735 --> 00:50:08,124
It's Kang Moyeon.

770
00:50:09,433 --> 00:50:10,718
Are you done with the surgery?

771
00:50:11,004 --> 00:50:14,210
Yes, I heard you came by.

772
00:50:14,624 --> 00:50:16,726
This is the first time
a doctor blew me off.

773
00:50:19,097 --> 00:50:20,952
There was an urgent operation.

774
00:50:22,003 --> 00:50:23,150
Did the patient survive?

775
00:50:23,401 --> 00:50:24,099
What?

776
00:50:24,226 --> 00:50:26,043
The patient who had the urgent operation.

777
00:50:27,634 --> 00:50:29,623
Yes, we saved the patient.

778
00:50:30,813 --> 00:50:31,805
You're so cool.

779
00:50:33,415 --> 00:50:35,434
Is this your phone number?

780
00:50:36,855 --> 00:50:37,603
Yes.

781
00:50:38,885 --> 00:50:40,292
So, you got my number.

782
00:50:40,678 --> 00:50:42,295
You can save my number.

783
00:50:44,874 --> 00:50:46,481
I definitely want to see you tomorrow.

784
00:50:48,399 --> 00:50:50,627
Are you always this straight forward?

785
00:50:50,983 --> 00:50:53,165
I meant I really want
to get treated tomorrow.

786
00:50:53,562 --> 00:50:54,629
Of course.

787
00:50:55,506 --> 00:50:57,752
-That's what I meant too.
-I don't think so.

788
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:00,704
Do you really not trust your doctor?

789
00:51:01,965 --> 00:51:03,495
Did you take your medication?

790
00:51:04,447 --> 00:51:07,248
If I don't take my medicine,
will it get worse?

791
00:51:07,653 --> 00:51:09,359
Will I have to be
hospitalized or something?

792
00:51:11,051 --> 00:51:12,749
What time should we meet
for appointment tomorrow?

793
00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:19,318
Instead of that,
should we see each other now?

794
00:51:26,796 --> 00:51:27,712
You don't want to?

795
00:51:30,035 --> 00:51:32,658
No, please come.

796
00:52:26,322 --> 00:52:28,942
"Two UN workers are kidnapped"

797
00:52:38,911 --> 00:52:39,641
Salute.

798
00:52:40,403 --> 00:52:42,887
Current location is Haesung Hospital,
Gangnam, Seoul.

799
00:52:43,305 --> 00:52:44,828
Yes, I'll stand by.

800
00:52:45,476 --> 00:52:46,446
Yes, understood.

801
00:52:52,273 --> 00:52:53,258
Have you arrived?

802
00:52:53,403 --> 00:52:55,210
Yes, I'm here.

803
00:52:55,418 --> 00:52:57,309
But something came up,
so I need to go back.

804
00:52:58,255 --> 00:53:01,243
You're leaving? Where are you right now?

805
00:53:01,504 --> 00:53:02,520
I'm on the rooftop.

806
00:53:02,884 --> 00:53:05,925
The rooftop? Which rooftop?

807
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:13,013
What are you doing here?

808
00:53:15,614 --> 00:53:16,630
I'm sorry,

809
00:53:17,243 --> 00:53:19,073
but I'm going to have
to blow you off this time.

810
00:53:24,437 --> 00:53:25,556
It must be an emergency.

811
00:53:25,675 --> 00:53:27,675
-You should go to the first floor...
-No.

812
00:53:29,276 --> 00:53:31,759
-They're here for me.
-You?

813
00:53:32,085 --> 00:53:32,910
Why?

814
00:53:34,473 --> 00:53:35,981
Did a war break out?

815
00:53:39,995 --> 00:53:43,797
Somewhere, but not here, so don't worry.

816
00:53:44,243 --> 00:53:46,584
Then why is a helicopter
coming to get you?

817
00:53:46,698 --> 00:53:48,302
I'll explain it later.

818
00:53:49,029 --> 00:53:50,651
But please promise me something.

819
00:54:03,795 --> 00:54:06,316
Let's meet next weekend.

820
00:54:06,621 --> 00:54:08,151
Not at the hospital, but somewhere else.

821
00:54:08,326 --> 00:54:09,747
Aren't you going to come to get treated?

822
00:54:09,873 --> 00:54:11,690
I'll come back healthily,

823
00:54:12,995 --> 00:54:14,714
so let's watch a movie together.

824
00:54:21,044 --> 00:54:23,262
Hurry up, I don't have time.

825
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:26,108
Yes or no?

826
00:54:28,268 --> 00:54:29,241
Yes.

827
00:54:30,554 --> 00:54:31,940
You made a promise.

828
00:56:13,464 --> 00:56:15,197
We've entered operation area.

829
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:17,858
We will now begin tactical flight.

830
00:56:24,242 --> 00:56:25,545
How far have we come?

831
00:56:26,073 --> 00:56:27,736
We've been in flight for seven hours.

832
00:56:29,445 --> 00:56:30,746
Then our destination is...

833
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:31,648
Yes...

834
00:56:43,954 --> 00:56:44,890
Harry Potter.

835
00:56:45,009 --> 00:56:46,334
Staff Sergeant Gong Cheolho.

836
00:56:46,477 --> 00:56:48,756
The mosquitoes here are the worst.
Be careful.

837
00:56:49,004 --> 00:56:50,257
Yes, sir.

838
00:56:53,345 --> 00:56:55,464
But, why are we taking off
our identification tags?

839
00:56:55,934 --> 00:56:57,982
If we are killed during the operation,

840
00:56:58,457 --> 00:57:00,243
we need to be unidentifiable.

841
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:37,482
Where are we right now?

842
00:57:40,974 --> 00:57:42,218
Afghanistan.

843
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:36,720
"Descendants Of The Sun"

844
00:58:36,834 --> 00:58:38,410
This is not a sparring
but an actual warfare.

845
00:58:38,524 --> 00:58:40,214
There is a possibility
of dying or killing.

846
00:58:40,318 --> 00:58:41,449
Did you think about me?

847
00:58:41,952 --> 00:58:43,023
Of course, I did.

848
00:58:43,127 --> 00:58:44,424
How about you, Mr. Yoo Shijin?

849
00:58:44,554 --> 00:58:45,663
Of course I did. A lot.

850
00:58:45,794 --> 00:58:48,158
Dr. Kang, I really
wasn't going to call you.

851
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:50,587
Aren't you embarrassed?
Aren't you ashamed?

852
00:58:51,304 --> 00:58:53,136
We have decided to send the Alpha Team.

853
00:58:53,477 --> 00:58:54,992
Which place are you talking about?

854
00:58:55,144 --> 00:58:56,134
Kang Moyeon.

855
00:58:56,446 --> 00:58:59,318
I'm assigning you as the team leader
of the Volunteer Corps.

856
00:58:59,461 --> 00:59:01,208
Unidentified explosive is
found around the unpaved area.

857
00:59:01,354 --> 00:59:05,785
You're doing a job that might
get you killed, Mr. Yoo Shijin.
