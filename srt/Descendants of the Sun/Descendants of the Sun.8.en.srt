1
00:00:03,784 --> 00:00:05,283
Mister!

2
00:00:12,642 --> 00:00:14,070
No matter what I did,

3
00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:17,691
I kept thinking of you.

4
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:21,309
I tried tiring myself out.

5
00:00:22,056 --> 00:00:23,154
I tried very hard to forget.

6
00:00:23,987 --> 00:00:25,942
I drank and did everything I could.

7
00:00:29,434 --> 00:00:31,067
Even then, I still missed you.

8
00:00:43,885 --> 00:00:45,637
Was this something
you never thought you'd hear?

9
00:00:49,019 --> 00:00:50,384
Then you should think on it.

10
00:00:51,978 --> 00:00:53,246
This time, I'm being serious.

11
00:01:09,454 --> 00:01:10,371
Go get some rest.

12
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,166
I was going to take you back,

13
00:01:13,966 --> 00:01:16,435
but I'm afraid I can't since
it's too late. I should go now.

14
00:01:18,846 --> 00:01:20,789
I'm going to the headquarter
for a situation report.

15
00:01:23,786 --> 00:01:25,588
You can make calls
at the military headquarters, right?

16
00:01:27,181 --> 00:01:29,092
I have a call to make.

17
00:01:34,165 --> 00:01:37,240
Jacquito Company, report
on the casualties as of now.

18
00:01:38,503 --> 00:01:41,762
As of now, 3 missing,
20 dead, 42 injured.

19
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,790
No further damage. Over.

20
00:02:04,067 --> 00:02:06,259
The communication is cut off at
the Mowuru Company as well, right?

21
00:02:06,804 --> 00:02:09,189
Yes. How long do you think
it'll take for restoration?

22
00:02:09,274 --> 00:02:12,099
We're working hard, but I think
it'll still take about 2 to 3 days.

23
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,285
The briefing will take place in 5 minutes.

24
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,221
Okay.

25
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:24,993
I was with him...

26
00:02:26,074 --> 00:02:27,996
...at his last moment.

27
00:02:30,437 --> 00:02:36,693
There was something he wanted me
to tell you, so I called you.

28
00:02:38,844 --> 00:02:42,494
It's great just laying here
and staring at the sky,

29
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,477
without having to do any work.

30
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,512
I feel so blessed.

31
00:02:49,576 --> 00:02:52,252
I worked long enough and earned enough,

32
00:02:52,337 --> 00:02:53,796
to send my kids to college.

33
00:02:54,028 --> 00:02:56,875
So the rest is up to them.

34
00:02:57,484 --> 00:02:58,800
My wife...

35
00:03:05,174 --> 00:03:06,778
There's not much to say about her.

36
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:11,020
She and I spent more time looking
at pictures of each other,

37
00:03:11,104 --> 00:03:13,694
rather than at each other's faces.

38
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:17,530
My Oknam...

39
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:19,874
She will really have
to spend the rest of her life,

40
00:03:19,974 --> 00:03:21,154
looking at my picture now.

41
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:30,521
With regarding his pension, aside from
the amount issued by the company,

42
00:03:31,424 --> 00:03:34,216
he said that his nephew
will take care of it for you.

43
00:03:37,124 --> 00:03:37,980
Yes.

44
00:03:39,884 --> 00:03:40,940
And one more thing...

45
00:03:46,465 --> 00:03:50,615
...he told you not
to live alone for too long.

46
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:20,027
All the emergency surgeries are over.

47
00:04:20,765 --> 00:04:22,979
I appreciate your hard work, Doctor Song.

48
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:32,623
-It looks like a wedding ring, right?
-Yeah.

49
00:04:33,951 --> 00:04:34,988
Did you steal it?

50
00:04:40,524 --> 00:04:42,382
It belongs to the patient
who just went through surgery.

51
00:04:44,604 --> 00:04:46,125
But I can't give it back to him.

52
00:05:13,964 --> 00:05:17,180
You can keep it like this
until your left arm heals properly.

53
00:05:18,874 --> 00:05:19,953
Thank you.

54
00:05:27,634 --> 00:05:29,029
Are you really going to be like this?

55
00:05:29,315 --> 00:05:30,429
Then what am I supposed to do?

56
00:05:30,514 --> 00:05:32,794
I promised them an interview
in exchange for some blood.

57
00:05:32,955 --> 00:05:34,791
They already donated blood.
What should I do now?

58
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,755
So, what are you going to do?

59
00:05:39,147 --> 00:05:39,996
To the right.

60
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:41,974
You should help a bit.

61
00:05:42,154 --> 00:05:43,294
Aren't you hungry?

62
00:05:43,755 --> 00:05:45,382
Let's finish it quickly and eat.

63
00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:46,449
To the left.

64
00:05:46,534 --> 00:05:48,921
Don't be like that and
make use of your looks a little bit.

65
00:05:49,085 --> 00:05:50,352
What else are you going to use it for?

66
00:05:53,035 --> 00:05:54,637
I will use it on you.

67
00:05:54,865 --> 00:05:55,867
Use it to make you my wife.

68
00:05:55,952 --> 00:05:57,250
Keep calling me your wife.

69
00:05:57,335 --> 00:05:58,198
Keep calling?

70
00:05:58,573 --> 00:05:59,633
I'll take that as a permission.

71
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,422
Lantern, on the left side.

72
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:08,535
Continue doing it later.

73
00:06:08,687 --> 00:06:09,748
Didn't you say you were hungry?

74
00:06:09,946 --> 00:06:11,201
I will go get something.

75
00:06:33,348 --> 00:06:34,537
By the way,

76
00:06:34,676 --> 00:06:36,933
that guy who's fixing the car outside...

77
00:06:38,494 --> 00:06:39,846
Who is he?

78
00:06:39,931 --> 00:06:41,877
I saw him earlier in our operation room.

79
00:06:42,928 --> 00:06:46,606
Some type of Peacemaker
relief doctor or something.

80
00:06:47,334 --> 00:06:48,463
For real?

81
00:06:49,514 --> 00:06:51,104
Why would he do that
with such a handsome face?

82
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:54,531
Are you talking about Doctor Daniel?

83
00:06:55,084 --> 00:06:56,582
Yeah, you know him?

84
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:59,595
I knew it.
I recognized him right away.

85
00:06:59,784 --> 00:07:01,635
I should have tried talking to him...

86
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,240
What's with this obsessive stalking?

87
00:07:03,325 --> 00:07:04,879
I'm a big fan of his.

88
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:07,385
He's not just any Schweitzer.

89
00:07:07,939 --> 00:07:09,823
He's Schweitzer with
Bill Gates's background.

90
00:07:10,158 --> 00:07:12,801
He's the son of an enormous
hedge fund company owner in Canada.

91
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:13,890
-For real?
-Really?

92
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:18,145
Yes! Because of that, he's really
famous within the NGO community.

93
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:22,114
His mom is Korean, so he's famous
in Korea for that as well.

94
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:25,280
If he is rich like that,
why would he work with an NGO?

95
00:07:25,364 --> 00:07:28,670
Because he is that rich
and has no worries, so he does that.

96
00:07:28,754 --> 00:07:30,142
He needs something to worry about.

97
00:07:32,236 --> 00:07:34,736
Where is Doctor Kang?
Still at the military headquarters?

98
00:07:57,804 --> 00:07:59,065
Please don't look at me.

99
00:08:05,936 --> 00:08:08,273
Is there any dark and
quiet place around here?

100
00:08:11,334 --> 00:08:13,415
That's what a man would usually say.

101
00:08:16,305 --> 00:08:20,075
Then, do you want me to pretend
as if it's someplace quiet?

102
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:29,342
You did a good job today.

103
00:08:38,994 --> 00:08:42,865
I need to hear your answer
so that I can wipe your tears.

104
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:47,978
Look at me for a moment.

105
00:09:01,571 --> 00:09:02,409
Wow.

106
00:09:03,945 --> 00:09:05,657
Shame on them.

107
00:09:07,695 --> 00:09:09,870
It's like they don't know
what happened down here.

108
00:09:11,604 --> 00:09:13,270
I thought it would be comforting...

109
00:09:13,866 --> 00:09:15,589
I have already been comforted...

110
00:09:16,579 --> 00:09:17,857
...by you.

111
00:09:27,254 --> 00:09:28,600
Thank you...

112
00:09:30,124 --> 00:09:31,332
...for coming back.

113
00:09:34,777 --> 00:09:37,330
If you weren't there today,

114
00:09:38,604 --> 00:09:40,359
I might have run away.

115
00:09:42,984 --> 00:09:45,115
If you have a plan to run away,
let's run away together.

116
00:09:45,745 --> 00:09:47,056
Running away...

117
00:09:47,141 --> 00:09:49,193
...is more fun when a man and
a woman do it together.

118
00:10:15,184 --> 00:10:16,142
Okay.

119
00:10:16,632 --> 00:10:17,492
The dia...

120
00:10:17,695 --> 00:10:19,984
The diamonds are stored
in a safe place, but...

121
00:10:20,637 --> 00:10:22,329
You know how it is.

122
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:24,517
Please, give me some more time.

123
00:10:29,479 --> 00:10:31,267
That's not what you promised.

124
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,443
But there's like a natural disaster!

125
00:10:35,921 --> 00:10:40,232
A natural disaster's one of
the busiest times for men like you and I.

126
00:10:40,498 --> 00:10:42,032
Second only to war.

127
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,389
You have until tomorrow
to bring me the diamonds.

128
00:10:44,522 --> 00:10:47,869
But, there are so many eyes watching.

129
00:10:55,887 --> 00:10:57,453
No excuses.

130
00:10:57,538 --> 00:10:59,122
Just act quick.

131
00:10:59,834 --> 00:11:01,344
Tomorrow before sunset.

132
00:11:01,957 --> 00:11:02,790
Got it?

133
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,374
-Got it?
-Got it.

134
00:11:12,526 --> 00:11:13,496
Got it.

135
00:11:38,617 --> 00:11:39,498
Water.

136
00:11:40,752 --> 00:11:41,616
It's water.

137
00:11:43,363 --> 00:11:45,214
Is anyone there?

138
00:11:47,424 --> 00:11:49,239
Help me, please.

139
00:11:58,654 --> 00:12:01,479
I can't be bothered. I'll just die.

140
00:12:04,994 --> 00:12:07,097
Hey, you sleepyhead.

141
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,439
Your safety hat.

142
00:12:09,912 --> 00:12:12,579
Always wear a safety hat
when you're on site.

143
00:12:12,664 --> 00:12:13,754
Safety hat.

144
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:17,474
Keep that up and your head's going
to blow up and you'll croak,

145
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:18,807
you rotten rascal.

146
00:12:20,526 --> 00:12:22,835
I wore my safety hat,

147
00:12:25,405 --> 00:12:28,453
so hurry and come to save me.

148
00:12:50,294 --> 00:12:52,281
What a weight off my shoulders.

149
00:12:52,366 --> 00:12:54,075
You should have done this earlier.

150
00:12:55,004 --> 00:12:58,430
Let's go straight through
into the office like this.

151
00:12:58,514 --> 00:12:59,766
Okay, stop.

152
00:13:04,024 --> 00:13:05,614
Stop the excavator.

153
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:08,666
Alpha Team,
resume the search for survivors now.

154
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,937
-Medics, get ready as well.
-Radio signal is okay.

155
00:13:11,022 --> 00:13:13,401
Why?! What more search do you need?!

156
00:13:13,486 --> 00:13:15,463
There are still three people missing.

157
00:13:15,548 --> 00:13:17,200
What frustrating nonsense is that?!

158
00:13:17,285 --> 00:13:20,595
In this situation, you should assume
the missing as deceased by now!

159
00:13:21,543 --> 00:13:23,721
It will be the doctors
who makes that call.

160
00:13:25,014 --> 00:13:26,687
Hey you, Three Strips.

161
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:27,897
I guess you're in charge today...

162
00:13:27,982 --> 00:13:30,526
-Please leave the site.
-Leave where? Do you hear my words?!

163
00:13:31,304 --> 00:13:32,165
Get out.

164
00:13:34,574 --> 00:13:36,252
Anyone missing is still alive.

165
00:13:36,646 --> 00:13:38,936
We will not give up
on the survivors until the end.

166
00:13:39,364 --> 00:13:42,200
Let's begin the search party.

167
00:13:43,014 --> 00:13:45,004
-What's impossible...
-We make possible!

168
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,505
I'm going crazy.

169
00:14:06,187 --> 00:14:07,949
We're the rescue team
from the Taebaek Unit!

170
00:14:10,624 --> 00:14:12,130
Is there anyone in there?

171
00:14:12,614 --> 00:14:14,345
If there is, please knock three times.

172
00:14:28,427 --> 00:14:30,464
If it doesn't work,
I'll make it happen, too.

173
00:14:31,234 --> 00:14:33,326
I'll find the survivors, too.

174
00:14:33,991 --> 00:14:35,628
We're the Taebaek Rescue Unit.

175
00:15:19,994 --> 00:15:20,852
Hey!

176
00:15:22,901 --> 00:15:24,859
Are you from rescue team?

177
00:15:25,229 --> 00:15:27,328
Oh! How do I get him out?

178
00:15:27,489 --> 00:15:30,618
Please save me.

179
00:15:30,715 --> 00:15:32,029
Hurry!

180
00:15:32,128 --> 00:15:34,148
I'm a doctor!

181
00:15:52,014 --> 00:15:54,543
It's an aftershock! Get out quickly!

182
00:15:59,554 --> 00:16:01,676
Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?

183
00:16:01,896 --> 00:16:03,546
I'm okay!

184
00:16:04,084 --> 00:16:06,760
Please get me out. Hurry!

185
00:16:07,504 --> 00:16:08,353
Grab my hand.

186
00:16:28,694 --> 00:16:30,961
What are you waiting for?
The building is collapsing!

187
00:16:31,464 --> 00:16:32,699
Hurry up!

188
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:34,975
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

189
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:38,224
Where are you going? Hey! Hey!

190
00:16:38,374 --> 00:16:39,751
Get me out!

191
00:16:58,276 --> 00:16:59,149
Are you okay?

192
00:17:01,404 --> 00:17:03,087
There's someone inside...

193
00:17:03,894 --> 00:17:06,038
Are you alright? Are you hurt?

194
00:17:06,154 --> 00:17:07,022
Are you hurt anywhere?

195
00:17:07,724 --> 00:17:09,293
There's someone inside.

196
00:17:09,805 --> 00:17:11,280
Hurry, it's collapsing!

197
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:13,342
There's a person in there. He's Korean.

198
00:17:18,836 --> 00:17:20,204
Wait here and watch.

199
00:17:20,384 --> 00:17:23,195
If the power building starts to sway
and lean by 10 degrees or more,

200
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,127
blow this whistle.

201
00:17:24,212 --> 00:17:25,147
Yes, Sir.

202
00:17:26,264 --> 00:17:28,018
Put me through to the situation room.

203
00:17:28,661 --> 00:17:29,933
Are you all right?

204
00:17:30,297 --> 00:17:31,259
I'm okay.

205
00:17:31,494 --> 00:17:34,240
If the Richter scale reads higher than 5.0
or if you hear his whistle blowing...

206
00:17:34,325 --> 00:17:37,095
I got it so give me your
hand for a little bit.

207
00:17:41,051 --> 00:17:43,014
How in the world
do you call yourself fine?

208
00:17:43,294 --> 00:17:45,606
I'm putting a compression bandage on you
and you are going to wear it.

209
00:18:14,855 --> 00:18:16,601
Where is this?

210
00:18:18,978 --> 00:18:20,324
The third floor basement?

211
00:18:22,596 --> 00:18:24,127
I'm going crazy, jeez.

212
00:18:25,554 --> 00:18:27,208
Save me!

213
00:18:28,364 --> 00:18:30,684
Please get me out of here!

214
00:18:35,474 --> 00:18:37,124
Can you hear me?

215
00:18:37,874 --> 00:18:40,480
Survivor! Can you hear me?!

216
00:18:40,564 --> 00:18:43,264
Yes, I can hear it. I can hear it well.

217
00:18:44,394 --> 00:18:46,295
Please save me!

218
00:18:46,898 --> 00:18:48,030
Help!

219
00:18:52,105 --> 00:18:54,219
-Where is he?
-In the third floor basement.

220
00:18:54,304 --> 00:18:56,359
Alpha Team is securing
a passage right now.

221
00:18:56,444 --> 00:18:57,787
Tell them I'm coming.

222
00:19:02,316 --> 00:19:03,595
I'll come with you.

223
00:19:05,012 --> 00:19:06,442
Give me the first aid kit

224
00:19:07,338 --> 00:19:08,746
Dr. Kang, you will wait here.

225
00:19:08,831 --> 00:19:10,230
I have to check the patient's condition.

226
00:19:10,314 --> 00:19:13,294
The first rule of a rescue site
is to not create a new victim.

227
00:19:13,684 --> 00:19:16,584
The patient's emergency medical
care will be carried out

228
00:19:16,684 --> 00:19:18,490
by the rescue unit until
safety of the area is secured.

229
00:19:18,814 --> 00:19:19,671
I see.

230
00:19:19,976 --> 00:19:20,927
Wolf to Situation Room.

231
00:19:21,228 --> 00:19:22,603
Do you read?

232
00:19:22,724 --> 00:19:24,597
In five minutes
the survivor will be secured.

233
00:19:24,783 --> 00:19:25,769
Please send in a medical kit.

234
00:19:25,854 --> 00:19:27,582
Roger that. I'm going down now.

235
00:19:37,737 --> 00:19:39,245
What are you doing right now?

236
00:19:40,354 --> 00:19:42,350
Do you think I can't read?

237
00:19:42,434 --> 00:19:44,079
It's better to make sure.

238
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:48,792
For your information,
I graduated as top of my class,

239
00:19:48,877 --> 00:19:50,164
at West Point,

240
00:19:50,294 --> 00:19:51,347
which means,

241
00:19:51,466 --> 00:19:53,133
I came on top among English-speaking...

242
00:19:53,222 --> 00:19:56,441
Report to me as soon as
you check the survivor's vitals.

243
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:00,392
Here.

244
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:05,759
I will come back and
talk to you in English so...

245
00:20:06,594 --> 00:20:07,766
...let's see each other later.

246
00:20:22,844 --> 00:20:25,502
Mister, did you bring anything to eat?

247
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,990
This guy just keeps giving me water.

248
00:20:28,074 --> 00:20:29,588
He said I shouldn't eat anything.

249
00:20:33,128 --> 00:20:33,981
You came empty-handed.

250
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,934
His seems to be healthy,
and he's noisy.

251
00:20:36,356 --> 00:20:37,486
But the problem is over there.

252
00:20:38,231 --> 00:20:40,642
I think we'll need to widen
the space using a hydraulic pump,

253
00:20:40,727 --> 00:20:42,737
but it might take some time
since that space is too narrow.

254
00:20:43,144 --> 00:20:44,632
But how did you get yourself here?

255
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:49,182
How did someone working
on the east wing get to the west wing?

256
00:20:49,921 --> 00:20:51,362
This is the west wing?

257
00:20:52,444 --> 00:20:55,041
I just crawled through
whatever space I could find.

258
00:20:56,454 --> 00:20:58,928
I crawled sideways when
I should've crawled upwards.

259
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:01,940
Just quickly get me out of here.

260
00:21:02,024 --> 00:21:04,762
Right now, I'm hungry and in pain.

261
00:21:05,174 --> 00:21:06,585
Where does it hurt the most?

262
00:21:07,082 --> 00:21:08,603
Blood pressure is 130/110.

263
00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:10,490
Pulse is 85.

264
00:21:10,574 --> 00:21:12,970
I think the left ankle and the
right shoulder might be fractured.

265
00:21:13,054 --> 00:21:14,379
Seems like his vital signs are good.

266
00:21:14,464 --> 00:21:17,293
For now, give him glucose and
painkillers through an IV drip.

267
00:21:17,424 --> 00:21:20,320
But do you know how to find
the vein for the IV line?

268
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,582
I will be able to find it.

269
00:21:22,384 --> 00:21:23,615
Have you done it before?

270
00:21:24,397 --> 00:21:25,800
We were trained in the army.

271
00:21:29,604 --> 00:21:31,141
Have you really done this before?

272
00:21:32,604 --> 00:21:34,310
Why is everyone underestimating me today?

273
00:21:35,742 --> 00:21:37,252
It's either your arm or your forehead.

274
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,239
Is that okay?

275
00:21:38,324 --> 00:21:39,516
The forehead hurts more.

276
00:21:40,727 --> 00:21:41,845
My arm, then.

277
00:21:43,894 --> 00:21:47,378
I'm going to give him IV fluids
and 30mg of the NSAID.

278
00:21:51,984 --> 00:21:55,594
I think we will need
one more hydraulic pump.

279
00:21:57,074 --> 00:21:58,172
I think so, too.

280
00:21:59,399 --> 00:22:01,298
I think someone needs
to go out and bring it.

281
00:22:01,399 --> 00:22:02,314
Yes.

282
00:22:03,082 --> 00:22:05,319
I think you have to go out and bring it.

283
00:22:06,595 --> 00:22:08,269
I'll stay here.

284
00:22:08,354 --> 00:22:09,668
The passageway is narrow.

285
00:22:10,063 --> 00:22:11,161
The hard work...

286
00:22:11,782 --> 00:22:12,917
...is all yours.

287
00:22:16,792 --> 00:22:18,109
I'll be right back.

288
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:42,170
How long have I been trapped here?

289
00:22:42,254 --> 00:22:43,803
This is the third day.

290
00:22:44,664 --> 00:22:46,621
That's a bit over 50 hours.

291
00:22:48,636 --> 00:22:49,754
Are there a lot of...

292
00:22:51,397 --> 00:22:52,707
...people who died?

293
00:23:00,686 --> 00:23:01,759
There are many who died,

294
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:04,672
and many whom we rescued.

295
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,641
You survived, too.

296
00:23:12,074 --> 00:23:13,991
We don't know that yet.

297
00:23:15,964 --> 00:23:18,290
But why is it so itchy?

298
00:23:24,765 --> 00:23:26,226
Dr. Kang, do you hear me?

299
00:23:29,218 --> 00:23:31,690
He is having difficulty breathing,
and his blood pressure is also dropping.

300
00:23:32,504 --> 00:23:34,118
I'm sure I administered it properly.

301
00:23:34,634 --> 00:23:36,436
-It is because you gave it properly.

302
00:23:36,971 --> 00:23:37,810
-What?

303
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:41,378
It's a rare case,
but he might be allergic to NSAID.

304
00:23:41,463 --> 00:23:44,222
In a short while, his airway
will begin to swell as well.

305
00:23:44,835 --> 00:23:45,708
What should I do?

306
00:23:45,793 --> 00:23:47,381
Double the amount of IV fluids.

307
00:23:47,466 --> 00:23:50,436
He'll be fine if you give him
Pheniramine, so don't worry.

308
00:23:51,385 --> 00:23:54,366
It you don't have that in your kit.

309
00:23:54,451 --> 00:23:55,289
What should we do?

310
00:23:55,374 --> 00:23:56,852
Did you hear that, Sergeant Major?

311
00:23:56,937 --> 00:23:58,248
I'll bring it to you.

312
00:23:58,333 --> 00:23:59,764
I'll find it and give it to you.

313
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,391
How is everything inside?

314
00:24:06,561 --> 00:24:07,691
It isn't good.

315
00:24:08,014 --> 00:24:09,430
I won't be surprised
if it collapsed any time soon.

316
00:24:09,514 --> 00:24:10,650
Here you go.

317
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:21,613
It's not an aftershock.

318
00:24:21,854 --> 00:24:24,414
What's that noise?
Check the power plant immediately!

319
00:24:47,842 --> 00:24:48,825
What is happening?

320
00:24:49,631 --> 00:24:50,499
Is it another aftershock?

321
00:24:52,398 --> 00:24:53,520
Situation room. Situation room!

322
00:24:53,605 --> 00:24:55,990
What's going on now?
I barely survived as it is!

323
00:24:56,074 --> 00:24:57,488
What's happening now?

324
00:24:58,034 --> 00:24:58,876
Move out of the way!

325
00:25:02,806 --> 00:25:04,061
Captain Yoo, are you okay?

326
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:05,347
Captain Yoo!

327
00:25:06,496 --> 00:25:07,735
Please answer.

328
00:25:08,354 --> 00:25:09,228
Captain Yoo!

329
00:25:09,701 --> 00:25:10,752
Captain Yoo!

330
00:25:15,649 --> 00:25:16,797
We lost contact.

331
00:25:18,986 --> 00:25:21,676
Big Boss, Big Boss, do you copy?!

332
00:25:22,574 --> 00:25:24,678
Chief Manager Jin
is digging with an excavator.

333
00:25:24,763 --> 00:25:27,718
That son of a bitch bastard.
Drag him over here immediately!

334
00:25:31,724 --> 00:25:33,575
You bastard! Stop right now!

335
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,866
There's people down there. You scumbag.

336
00:25:45,674 --> 00:25:47,274
I've caught the crazy bastard.

337
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:49,376
Lock him up somewhere
so he can't run away.

338
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:52,964
If anything bad happens to anyone,
I'll break his skull.

339
00:25:53,081 --> 00:25:55,029
Alpha Team, get all your equipment
and get here right now.

340
00:25:55,114 --> 00:25:56,026
We're running out of time.

341
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,200
Yes, Sir!

342
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,739
If the ground becomes unsteady and
there's a secondary collapse...

343
00:26:05,524 --> 00:26:06,666
It'll be dangerous.

344
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,124
But you don't care, right?

345
00:26:12,234 --> 00:26:13,231
Salute.

346
00:26:35,871 --> 00:26:37,018
Mister!

347
00:26:38,657 --> 00:26:39,581
Mister!

348
00:26:41,044 --> 00:26:43,542
Mister, are you okay?

349
00:26:45,664 --> 00:26:47,308
Mister, you didn't die, right?

350
00:26:48,868 --> 00:26:50,773
Please get up, Mister.

351
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:51,789
Hey.

352
00:26:55,064 --> 00:26:56,235
I guess he is dead.

353
00:26:59,213 --> 00:27:00,276
Hello!

354
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:02,114
Is there anyone out there?

355
00:27:02,775 --> 00:27:05,106
There's a dead person here!

356
00:27:05,576 --> 00:27:06,477
Help!

357
00:27:08,358 --> 00:27:10,840
Don't call me "Mister".

358
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:13,834
Are you okay?

359
00:27:14,401 --> 00:27:15,248
Mister.

360
00:27:15,488 --> 00:27:18,037
I thought you were dead.

361
00:27:22,282 --> 00:27:23,900
I told you don't call me that.

362
00:27:26,185 --> 00:27:28,161
Why does that matter now?

363
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:32,183
It's always matters.

364
00:27:37,964 --> 00:27:39,017
Are you hurt anywhere?

365
00:27:42,044 --> 00:27:44,224
I don't think it is the time
for you to worry about me.

366
00:27:44,624 --> 00:27:46,899
Mister, look at you.

367
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:49,162
Your wrist is bleeding.

368
00:27:49,736 --> 00:27:50,628
I guess you're right.

369
00:27:54,644 --> 00:27:56,564
-Your foot is out now.
-Ouch.

370
00:28:01,144 --> 00:28:03,102
What good is that?

371
00:28:03,426 --> 00:28:05,253
The passageway is blocked.

372
00:28:06,177 --> 00:28:08,268
It's the same as being trapped.

373
00:28:13,096 --> 00:28:14,199
This is Big Boss.

374
00:28:14,805 --> 00:28:16,337
Does anyone read me?

375
00:28:18,564 --> 00:28:19,691
This is Big Boss.

376
00:28:19,754 --> 00:28:20,645
Situation room.

377
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:21,886
-Alpha Team.
-I was doubting,

378
00:28:21,986 --> 00:28:23,110
why I was so lucky to survive.

379
00:28:24,165 --> 00:28:27,085
Forget about it.
I'll just think myself as good as dead.

380
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,986
Don't worry. You won't die.

381
00:28:29,814 --> 00:28:32,265
What are you saying,
we even lost radio contact.

382
00:28:35,564 --> 00:28:37,001
I said we're going to
get out of here alive.

383
00:28:38,124 --> 00:28:39,004
Hey, kid,

384
00:28:39,554 --> 00:28:41,068
isn't your girlfriend waiting?

385
00:28:41,372 --> 00:28:43,143
I don't have a girlfriend.

386
00:28:44,922 --> 00:28:46,180
Do you have one?

387
00:28:48,642 --> 00:28:49,943
Earlier over the radio,

388
00:28:51,164 --> 00:28:52,961
you heard that female
doctor's voice, right?

389
00:28:55,342 --> 00:28:57,674
I really like her, but.

390
00:29:00,013 --> 00:29:01,340
I was rejected about three times.

391
00:29:02,542 --> 00:29:03,459
Should I have died?

392
00:29:03,544 --> 00:29:06,090
Oh my gosh. How are you still alive.

393
00:29:06,522 --> 00:29:08,960
If it were me, I would have
died of embarrassment.

394
00:29:09,801 --> 00:29:11,944
I somehow made it through that difficulty.

395
00:29:14,549 --> 00:29:16,984
This is the situation room.
Big Boss, do you copy?

396
00:29:18,321 --> 00:29:20,121
Please answer me.

397
00:29:22,914 --> 00:29:24,201
I'm going to go crazy.

398
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:28,151
He will be okay.

399
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,959
We will be able to get
in touch with him soon.

400
00:29:32,114 --> 00:29:33,829
But what were you doing since earlier?

401
00:29:38,274 --> 00:29:40,052
I'm getting ready to run
whenever I need to.

402
00:29:40,538 --> 00:29:41,887
I can't fall down here

403
00:30:01,534 --> 00:30:03,035
I was hoping you weren't hurt.

404
00:30:09,435 --> 00:30:10,548
You, too, Captain.

405
00:30:14,322 --> 00:30:15,527
But that woman,

406
00:30:16,309 --> 00:30:18,093
must be worried sick right now.

407
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,734
She must think I'm dead.

408
00:30:21,571 --> 00:30:22,970
"If I knew this is going to happen,"

409
00:30:23,612 --> 00:30:25,543
"I should have said yes
when he confessed to me."

410
00:30:26,585 --> 00:30:27,839
That's probably what she's thinking.

411
00:30:29,684 --> 00:30:31,195
So you think she deserved it?

412
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:33,751
No.

413
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:37,041
I'm worried.

414
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:42,874
Give me your arm.

415
00:30:50,844 --> 00:30:51,955
What's your name?

416
00:30:52,924 --> 00:30:54,266
Kang Minjae.

417
00:30:54,633 --> 00:30:55,669
Kang Minjae.

418
00:30:55,754 --> 00:30:57,343
But what are you doing?

419
00:30:57,594 --> 00:30:58,507
This is medicine.

420
00:30:59,088 --> 00:31:00,079
Medicine?

421
00:31:01,466 --> 00:31:02,711
What medicine?

422
00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:04,651
In case you're the only one...

423
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:06,684
...who gets out of here.

424
00:31:07,904 --> 00:31:09,443
What are you talking about?

425
00:31:09,574 --> 00:31:11,265
If I were to get out,
you should get out with me.

426
00:31:13,214 --> 00:31:14,185
Stop talking.

427
00:31:15,494 --> 00:31:16,860
Your throat is starting to swell.

428
00:31:16,945 --> 00:31:18,172
Don't talk and just stay still.

429
00:31:18,257 --> 00:31:19,459
So...

430
00:31:20,321 --> 00:31:22,014
Gosh, my throat is swollen.

431
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:24,910
See? I'm dying.

432
00:31:24,994 --> 00:31:26,753
I said you're not going to die.

433
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:28,830
Don't you trust me?

434
00:31:29,624 --> 00:31:30,954
I'm told I look really trustworthy.

435
00:31:31,044 --> 00:31:32,157
I don't think so.

436
00:31:33,944 --> 00:31:35,276
It's because you're hurt right now.

437
00:31:36,054 --> 00:31:39,191
Anyway, I have faith in my comrades.

438
00:31:39,514 --> 00:31:42,152
So you should try and
believe in them, too.

439
00:32:02,644 --> 00:32:03,713
He's here.

440
00:32:04,914 --> 00:32:05,768
In the future,

441
00:32:06,318 --> 00:32:09,084
if you're still alive, answer right away.

442
00:32:12,677 --> 00:32:13,516
See?

443
00:32:14,924 --> 00:32:15,870
We're saved.

444
00:32:15,954 --> 00:32:18,964
The survivors are getting out soon.
Medical team, be on standby.

445
00:32:24,314 --> 00:32:25,365
Are you okay?

446
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:29,988
What's your name?

447
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,752
I'm alive.

448
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,280
"Kang Minjae. Suspected fracture
on left ankle and right shoulder"

449
00:32:41,276 --> 00:32:42,910
This is patient has been
in a motorcycle accident.

450
00:32:43,121 --> 00:32:44,258
His chart is right here.

451
00:32:45,958 --> 00:32:47,211
Who wrote this?

452
00:32:48,641 --> 00:32:50,164
Who wrote this?

453
00:32:50,834 --> 00:32:54,373
That old soldier who saved my life.

454
00:32:56,754 --> 00:32:59,794
It's nice to make it out alive.

455
00:33:00,536 --> 00:33:03,122
I also get to see
a pretty doctor like you.

456
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:07,996
This is what I get for saving him.

457
00:33:08,972 --> 00:33:10,484
I told you I'm not that old.

458
00:33:11,787 --> 00:33:13,379
Please transport him to the Medicube.

459
00:33:36,944 --> 00:33:38,213
Bring another stretcher over here.

460
00:33:43,346 --> 00:33:44,468
Are there anymore injured people?

461
00:33:45,307 --> 00:33:47,077
Me. It's for me.

462
00:33:47,536 --> 00:33:48,473
I'm the survivor.

463
00:33:55,224 --> 00:33:56,327
I'll treat that patient.

464
00:34:01,118 --> 00:34:03,239
-Do you remember what happened earlier?
-What are you talking about?

465
00:34:03,324 --> 00:34:06,684
Nothing came to mind when you heard
that Sergeant Major Seo was okay?

466
00:34:07,427 --> 00:34:10,163
I was the one who sent
him out at that time.

467
00:34:10,268 --> 00:34:13,047
Couldn't you tell that I was
being kinder than usual?

468
00:34:13,336 --> 00:34:14,190
Salute.

469
00:34:14,853 --> 00:34:16,475
I will take care that patient,

470
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,697
so Dr. Kang will treat this fake patient.

471
00:34:24,759 --> 00:34:26,724
I'm really hurt.

472
00:34:27,172 --> 00:34:28,782
I really got injured.

473
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,111
Who said anything?

474
00:34:31,476 --> 00:34:32,914
I'll treat you.

475
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:36,412
Are you going to keep holding my wrist?

476
00:34:43,154 --> 00:34:44,872
What is up with this calmness?

477
00:34:48,963 --> 00:34:50,064
Are you all right, Sir?

478
00:34:51,575 --> 00:34:52,441
Let go.

479
00:34:53,181 --> 00:34:54,483
What should we do with this bastard?

480
00:34:54,994 --> 00:34:56,538
Let me go!

481
00:34:57,924 --> 00:34:59,175
I told you to keep your hands off me.

482
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,549
Everybody looks fine to me.

483
00:35:04,746 --> 00:35:07,364
Look. The survivors made it out alive.

484
00:35:07,945 --> 00:35:09,312
Isn't that good enough?

485
00:35:09,614 --> 00:35:10,941
What's the problem?

486
00:35:17,764 --> 00:35:18,993
Please calm down.

487
00:35:19,714 --> 00:35:20,934
-Let go!
-Please calm down.

488
00:35:23,325 --> 00:35:24,667
Oh my god, blood. Why you...

489
00:35:27,326 --> 00:35:28,423
Hey! You!

490
00:35:32,594 --> 00:35:33,665
He's so cool.

491
00:35:44,852 --> 00:35:46,092
It really stings.

492
00:35:52,644 --> 00:35:54,857
Are you doing that on purpose or...

493
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:56,852
...are you only good at surgeries?

494
00:35:57,010 --> 00:35:57,858
Ouch, that stings.

495
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:04,015
I came out alive,
and you won't even talk to me.

496
00:36:05,314 --> 00:36:06,405
Such a cold woman.

497
00:36:15,974 --> 00:36:17,504
You think this is a joke?

498
00:36:18,804 --> 00:36:20,803
You nearly died out there.

499
00:36:28,174 --> 00:36:29,861
I told you that it stings a lot just now.

500
00:36:32,514 --> 00:36:34,135
I was terrified.

501
00:36:34,999 --> 00:36:36,611
At the thought of you dying.

502
00:36:43,594 --> 00:36:45,492
I went in because I believed in you.

503
00:36:48,398 --> 00:36:50,107
You wouldn't leave me to die, would you?

504
00:36:50,192 --> 00:36:51,477
Do you always...

505
00:36:52,429 --> 00:36:54,188
...need to risk your life doing something?

506
00:36:54,284 --> 00:36:55,917
I'm a man who is good at his work.

507
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:57,695
And my work includes...

508
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:00,898
...me not dying.

509
00:37:06,004 --> 00:37:07,860
Captain, the Lieutenant Colonel is here!

510
00:37:07,944 --> 00:37:09,463
Right now? Where is he?

511
00:37:09,548 --> 00:37:10,389
Please lie down.

512
00:37:10,738 --> 00:37:12,470
He can't order a patient to come to him.

513
00:37:12,554 --> 00:37:13,994
The Lieutenant Colonel
is allowed to do so.

514
00:37:14,155 --> 00:37:16,479
Stay put until you get all the IV fluid.

515
00:37:16,564 --> 00:37:18,427
If you want to keep doing
your beloved work...

516
00:37:18,607 --> 00:37:21,535
...of risking your life, with a fit body,
lie back down.

517
00:37:22,884 --> 00:37:24,984
Tell the Lieutenant Colonel
that if he has something to say,

518
00:37:25,069 --> 00:37:27,096
come here and say it himself.

519
00:37:28,464 --> 00:37:30,270
Are you telling me to tell him that?

520
00:37:30,354 --> 00:37:31,969
Do you want to see me
go into detention...

521
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:32,943
What did you just say?

522
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:35,680
Salute.

523
00:37:35,765 --> 00:37:37,172
It's fine. At ease.

524
00:37:39,142 --> 00:37:40,130
Are you severely injured?

525
00:37:40,215 --> 00:37:41,857
-No, sir.
-Yes, he is.

526
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,275
Yes, I am definitely
severely injured, sir.

527
00:37:48,293 --> 00:37:50,550
I was notified that Haesung Hospital
is sending a plane,

528
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:52,738
for the return of
the medical team in two days.

529
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,243
Prepare to go to the airport at
13:00 the day after tomorrow.

530
00:37:56,883 --> 00:38:00,014
Dr. Kang, please prepare a list
of passengers and let me know.

531
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,241
Yes, sir.

532
00:38:12,449 --> 00:38:15,154
You, with the "two stars".

533
00:38:15,851 --> 00:38:17,137
Are you the Lieutenant Colonel?

534
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:19,985
I need a word with you.

535
00:38:23,035 --> 00:38:25,221
See this? Do you see this?

536
00:38:26,177 --> 00:38:27,930
I'm asking if you can see this!

537
00:38:30,247 --> 00:38:31,092
You.

538
00:38:31,826 --> 00:38:34,670
You mooched off a salary
from my hard-earned taxes.

539
00:38:35,101 --> 00:38:36,825
What century do you
think you're living in?

540
00:38:36,925 --> 00:38:38,853
How could a soldier beat up a civilian?

541
00:38:39,754 --> 00:38:42,554
I did it because I had a
reason for everything.

542
00:38:42,644 --> 00:38:44,019
The living have to live, don't they?

543
00:38:46,341 --> 00:38:47,205
Look.

544
00:38:47,622 --> 00:38:50,562
I will not let this slide so easily.

545
00:38:51,059 --> 00:38:53,199
I'll get a written medical record,
and file a civil complaint,

546
00:38:53,284 --> 00:38:56,181
to the Ministry of National Defense,
file a petition to the Blue House...

547
00:38:57,066 --> 00:38:59,153
I'm going to file civil and criminal
complaints against all of you,

548
00:38:59,238 --> 00:39:03,049
and I'm going to strip you all
off your uniforms, so be prepared.

549
00:39:03,993 --> 00:39:05,949
I'll take this to the court.

550
00:39:07,114 --> 00:39:09,306
Let's do that.
Let's take this to the court.

551
00:39:09,624 --> 00:39:10,525
Sounds good to me.

552
00:39:11,314 --> 00:39:14,679
You were at a restricted military area,
a civilian rescue site, for that matter,

553
00:39:14,764 --> 00:39:17,192
and almost killed people
with your excavator.

554
00:39:17,277 --> 00:39:19,199
Let's see how the court thinks about this.

555
00:39:19,324 --> 00:39:20,552
After your complaint is filed,

556
00:39:20,637 --> 00:39:22,862
I'll take you to a military trial,

557
00:39:23,384 --> 00:39:25,251
for willful negligence and
attempted murder, too,

558
00:39:25,336 --> 00:39:27,847
so prepare another a few copies of your
medical records while you're at it.

559
00:39:28,648 --> 00:39:29,889
I'm not a soldier.

560
00:39:29,974 --> 00:39:30,981
Is that so?

561
00:39:31,141 --> 00:39:36,017
You punks, while mooching off salaries
from hard-earned taxes,

562
00:39:36,102 --> 00:39:38,995
how could you lose control over
a civilian at a rescue site!

563
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,904
Pack your military gear immediately!

564
00:39:41,542 --> 00:39:42,782
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

565
00:39:43,794 --> 00:39:45,332
100 laps around the base.

566
00:39:46,014 --> 00:39:46,953
Except for the patient.

567
00:39:47,357 --> 00:39:49,264
Yoo Shijin, you finish getting your IV.

568
00:39:49,434 --> 00:39:50,364
Yes, sir.

569
00:39:50,707 --> 00:39:52,761
Instead, run 200 laps after you're done.

570
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:58,369
I'll run the laps with my comrades
this instant, Sir!

571
00:40:01,564 --> 00:40:02,943
Stay in line.

572
00:40:05,477 --> 00:40:07,496
Wait a second, I have a question.

573
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:10,229
You both were the ones who hit him.

574
00:40:10,314 --> 00:40:11,233
Why am I here?

575
00:40:12,916 --> 00:40:14,623
I just can't hold back my curiosity.

576
00:40:14,708 --> 00:40:17,061
If my wrist was okay,
I would have beat the hell...

577
00:40:17,162 --> 00:40:19,526
-Me?
-...out of that asshole.

578
00:40:20,694 --> 00:40:21,791
The timing is a bit odd.

579
00:40:21,876 --> 00:40:23,913
This is why you shouldn't have
hit him halfheartedly.

580
00:40:23,998 --> 00:40:26,324
You should have beat him up to death.

581
00:40:26,577 --> 00:40:29,094
Goodness me, you timing is also odd.

582
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:31,302
Make sure you count how many laps we did.

583
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:32,900
We ran seven laps, Sir.

584
00:40:32,985 --> 00:40:34,990
Already 27 laps? Oh my.

585
00:40:35,074 --> 00:40:37,132
No, Sir. Just seven.

586
00:40:37,253 --> 00:40:40,519
If this man says 27, then it's 27 laps!

587
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:41,990
Yes, Sir!

588
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:49,416
I have to consult my doctor.

589
00:40:49,944 --> 00:40:51,419
If I go on, I might die.

590
00:40:56,626 --> 00:40:57,865
You took the IV out.

591
00:40:59,155 --> 00:41:01,624
I wasn't lying
when I said you needed to rest.

592
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,154
Then, you shouldn't have come.

593
00:41:04,097 --> 00:41:05,702
You are my biggest problem,

594
00:41:05,787 --> 00:41:07,074
when it comes to resting.

595
00:41:08,063 --> 00:41:10,205
What have you done wrong
to deserve this punishment?

596
00:41:11,455 --> 00:41:12,646
I didn't do anything wrong.

597
00:41:13,109 --> 00:41:15,777
But you're doing this
because it's an order, right?

598
00:41:17,614 --> 00:41:21,004
You people are extremely
unreasonable and rigid.

599
00:41:21,124 --> 00:41:22,614
It's proof that rules exist.

600
00:41:22,699 --> 00:41:24,007
I don't care much for rules.

601
00:41:24,354 --> 00:41:26,597
I just wish you would stay alive.

602
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,507
Take this 30 minutes after your meal.

603
00:41:35,404 --> 00:41:36,333
Thank you...

604
00:41:38,053 --> 00:41:38,939
...for saving my life.

605
00:41:40,054 --> 00:41:42,284
I'll give you the list of personnel
set for departure later.

606
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:44,574
Has the list...

607
00:41:45,022 --> 00:41:45,976
...been finalized?

608
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,417
I'm on my way to discuss it.

609
00:41:51,628 --> 00:41:54,533
Are you on that list as well?

610
00:41:59,044 --> 00:41:59,958
Are you?

611
00:42:00,892 --> 00:42:01,936
This is...

612
00:42:02,716 --> 00:42:04,930
...my chance to leave you behind.

613
00:42:30,108 --> 00:42:31,338
Is everyone here?

614
00:42:32,215 --> 00:42:33,521
In two days time,

615
00:42:34,196 --> 00:42:37,478
a plane will arrive to take
the medical team back to Korea.

616
00:42:39,138 --> 00:42:41,022
Our volunteering period is over,

617
00:42:41,395 --> 00:42:43,874
and you can all go back now.

618
00:42:44,232 --> 00:42:47,423
Or you can also choose to stay behind.

619
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:51,590
If you decide to not board this flight,

620
00:42:51,817 --> 00:42:53,518
I don't know when the next flight
will be available.

621
00:42:54,644 --> 00:42:57,620
Until yesterday, we endured mindlessly,

622
00:42:58,274 --> 00:43:00,345
but today, we have a choice.

623
00:43:01,284 --> 00:43:03,123
Raise your hands if you want to stay.

624
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:12,473
The patient with a concussion
in bed 8 needs an MRI.

625
00:43:12,784 --> 00:43:15,917
Please give my seat to transport
that patient to Korea.

626
00:43:18,434 --> 00:43:19,513
Hey, Ha Jaae!

627
00:43:20,126 --> 00:43:22,725
How could you raise your hand?

628
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:26,502
Please give my seat
to the patient in bed 10.

629
00:43:27,167 --> 00:43:29,434
If you'll excuse me,
I need to check on a patient.

630
00:43:29,964 --> 00:43:31,054
I'll leave first.

631
00:43:36,284 --> 00:43:37,567
What's with them?

632
00:43:37,747 --> 00:43:40,328
If they leave like that,
what becomes of us?

633
00:43:41,554 --> 00:43:44,559
Dr. Kang, I'm really sorry,

634
00:43:45,258 --> 00:43:46,314
but I want to leave.

635
00:43:46,424 --> 00:43:47,678
Yes, we should leave.

636
00:43:47,763 --> 00:43:49,134
Let's all go back.

637
00:43:49,674 --> 00:43:51,355
It's nothing to be sorry about.

638
00:43:51,944 --> 00:43:53,646
The same goes for all of you.

639
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:55,408
Don't leave with a heavy heart.

640
00:43:55,834 --> 00:43:58,820
You've already done more than enough.

641
00:43:59,154 --> 00:44:00,424
Those who will be going back,

642
00:44:00,509 --> 00:44:02,462
please feel free to raise your hands.

643
00:44:11,433 --> 00:44:12,985
You can raise your hand too.

644
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:14,677
Why do you call me out specifically?

645
00:44:14,997 --> 00:44:16,247
I'm not leaving!

646
00:44:20,418 --> 00:44:21,910
Leave my seat open, though.

647
00:44:23,024 --> 00:44:24,578
My soul will sit there.

648
00:44:31,304 --> 00:44:34,913
By the way, where is Doctor Lee Chihoon?

649
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:47,662
Gosh, I'm itchy.

650
00:44:49,948 --> 00:44:50,810
Ugh, sand.

651
00:45:07,888 --> 00:45:08,738
Hey,

652
00:45:10,236 --> 00:45:11,988
you told me you were a doctor earlier,

653
00:45:12,484 --> 00:45:13,831
but you weren't.

654
00:45:14,674 --> 00:45:18,824
Are doctors who ignore and leave their
patients behind considered doctors?

655
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:31,449
What are you doing?

656
00:45:31,816 --> 00:45:33,466
You didn't hear
that we were having a meeting?

657
00:45:34,863 --> 00:45:35,773
I'm sorry.

658
00:45:38,204 --> 00:45:40,225
They said you found that patient.

659
00:45:41,016 --> 00:45:42,616
You did something great, Lee Chihoon.

660
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:47,917
Our return flight has been arranged.

661
00:45:48,143 --> 00:45:50,355
Some are staying, and some are leaving.

662
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:53,258
I put you on the list,
so don't feel pressured and just leave.

663
00:45:53,742 --> 00:45:55,189
Your wife is nearing her due date.

664
00:45:55,484 --> 00:45:56,825
You should be there with her.

665
00:45:58,514 --> 00:45:59,371
Yes.

666
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,554
Hey.

667
00:46:04,455 --> 00:46:05,694
What has happened to your hand?

668
00:46:11,224 --> 00:46:12,060
Hey.

669
00:46:12,862 --> 00:46:15,083
-Yeah.
-Have you seen Manager Go?

670
00:46:16,161 --> 00:46:19,164
I barely escaped death,
where is that old geezer?

671
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:22,739
He is not worried about me, is he?

672
00:46:23,924 --> 00:46:24,998
He's over there.

673
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:38,471
"Go Jaeul, Male, 54"

674
00:46:40,941 --> 00:46:42,269
This old man.

675
00:46:44,264 --> 00:46:46,335
Didn't you say you would live
if you wore a safety hat?

676
00:46:47,849 --> 00:46:49,509
That's how I survived.

677
00:46:51,104 --> 00:46:53,318
I listened to you for the first time...

678
00:46:54,924 --> 00:46:57,314
How can you do this to me?

679
00:46:57,708 --> 00:47:00,156
How could this happen?

680
00:47:00,893 --> 00:47:01,736
Why?!

681
00:47:01,821 --> 00:47:03,030
Why...?

682
00:47:16,377 --> 00:47:18,084
Why did you do this?

683
00:47:41,252 --> 00:47:42,644
This is the Captain of Mowuru Company.

684
00:47:43,204 --> 00:47:45,602
I'll provide a brief report of
the search efforts that took place today.

685
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:48,427
We have one survivor,
who is  undergoing treatment,

686
00:47:48,694 --> 00:47:51,387
and two have been confirmed as dead.

687
00:47:52,588 --> 00:47:53,777
There are no more missing persons,

688
00:47:54,759 --> 00:47:56,464
at the power plant.

689
00:47:57,635 --> 00:47:59,056
I officially announce,

690
00:47:59,647 --> 00:48:01,332
the end to the search
of missing personnel,

691
00:48:01,417 --> 00:48:03,951
at Mowuru Power Plant as of 11:00 today.

692
00:48:05,244 --> 00:48:08,009
You all did your best during
these unpredictable times of disaster.

693
00:48:09,193 --> 00:48:12,903
Haesung Hospital's medical team
and soldiers of the Taebaek Unit,

694
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:14,893
thank you for all of your hard work.

695
00:48:15,494 --> 00:48:16,528
-Good job.
-Great job.

696
00:48:16,628 --> 00:48:18,438
-Great job.
-You did well.

697
00:48:19,884 --> 00:48:20,992
-Good job.
-Great job.

698
00:48:22,794 --> 00:48:26,016
Starting now, the official responsibility
for this power plant,

699
00:48:26,193 --> 00:48:28,769
is transferred back to
Urk Electric Power Corporation

700
00:48:28,854 --> 00:48:30,557
In its entirety.

701
00:48:31,124 --> 00:48:35,169
Whether I dig ground or build a palace,

702
00:48:35,397 --> 00:48:38,590
I don't even want to see any trace
of soldiers or doctors here.

703
00:48:41,944 --> 00:48:42,982
What is this sound?

704
00:48:44,722 --> 00:48:45,947
Four days ago at this time,

705
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:49,075
an earthquake occurred.

706
00:48:50,284 --> 00:48:51,821
From this day on,

707
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:55,557
a siren to commemorate the victims
will go off at this time.

708
00:48:57,028 --> 00:48:59,165
Whenever you hear this siren,
stop what you're doing...

709
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:03,845
...and observe a moment of silence
and pray for the victims.

710
00:49:07,024 --> 00:49:08,638
Squad, attention.

711
00:49:17,855 --> 00:49:18,726
Everyone,

712
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:20,821
pay your tributes.

713
00:49:33,431 --> 00:49:35,431
"Power plant accident memorial"

714
00:49:41,873 --> 00:49:44,270
We're relatively used to death,

715
00:49:44,354 --> 00:49:45,775
since we see a lot of it
at the hospital.

716
00:49:46,365 --> 00:49:49,174
But I think this situation was different.

717
00:49:49,618 --> 00:49:51,549
You body will recover after you rest,

718
00:49:51,634 --> 00:49:54,384
but you will be
psychologically traumatized.

719
00:49:55,444 --> 00:49:58,040
After experiencing this,
I don't think there's much to life.

720
00:49:58,124 --> 00:49:59,931
You don't know what might
happen in the future.

721
00:50:01,669 --> 00:50:02,840
With that said,

722
00:50:03,671 --> 00:50:05,255
I'm getting a new car
when I go back to Korea.

723
00:50:05,967 --> 00:50:07,450
What kind of car should I get?

724
00:50:08,434 --> 00:50:10,057
Why are you asking me?

725
00:50:10,874 --> 00:50:12,934
Why can't I ask you?

726
00:50:13,019 --> 00:50:14,893
We've been through so much together.

727
00:50:18,264 --> 00:50:20,850
-You should date!
-You should date!

728
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:22,373
Stop it!

729
00:50:23,174 --> 00:50:24,569
Oh, it's working!

730
00:50:24,768 --> 00:50:26,000
-Really?
-What?

731
00:50:26,177 --> 00:50:27,603
-This is amazing.
-It's really working now.

732
00:50:27,688 --> 00:50:28,539
-It's working.
-It is.

733
00:50:28,624 --> 00:50:30,158
The network is back up...

734
00:50:33,382 --> 00:50:34,817
I guess you already know then.

735
00:50:35,604 --> 00:50:38,563
I guess you were all carrying your
phones despite having no signal.

736
00:50:40,284 --> 00:50:41,434
Salute.

737
00:50:43,594 --> 00:50:47,284
My mother seems to be doing fine.

738
00:50:47,472 --> 00:50:50,060
She is going around shopping
so her legs must be doing fine.

739
00:50:50,324 --> 00:50:52,451
She's been drinking a lot of coffee,

740
00:50:52,552 --> 00:50:54,007
that means, she still
has a lot of friends.

741
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:56,830
My friends are so chill.

742
00:50:56,914 --> 00:50:59,933
None of them asked how I was doing.
All they want is extra lives for games.

743
00:51:00,541 --> 00:51:01,396
Oh crap.

744
00:51:02,179 --> 00:51:05,154
My ex-boyfriend is getting married.

745
00:51:05,254 --> 00:51:07,951
Why is he sending such text message
to someone at a disaster scene?

746
00:51:12,664 --> 00:51:13,631
Hello?

747
00:51:14,981 --> 00:51:18,340
We decided to transport
four patients in our stead.

748
00:51:18,437 --> 00:51:21,073
The staff manager knows
about the patients, so ask him if needed,

749
00:51:21,162 --> 00:51:23,489
and get them the needed examinations,
even if you have to cut in line.

750
00:51:23,573 --> 00:51:26,069
Hey, how could you worry about
a patient at a time like this?

751
00:51:26,154 --> 00:51:28,462
They sent that plane
to bring you people back.

752
00:51:28,547 --> 00:51:31,060
The TV station and the VIP ward
have been in a mess without you.

753
00:51:31,145 --> 00:51:33,943
What are you going to do about this?
You've become quite the Schweitzer.

754
00:51:34,885 --> 00:51:36,029
You're right.

755
00:51:36,393 --> 00:51:37,849
I guess I was that kind
of doctor after all.

756
00:51:37,934 --> 00:51:39,544
Don't go nuts trying to save humanity.

757
00:51:39,629 --> 00:51:41,493
Return home the next chance you get.

758
00:51:41,837 --> 00:51:43,452
Because you are the most
important person to me.

759
00:51:45,117 --> 00:51:46,259
Don't worry.

760
00:51:46,574 --> 00:51:48,817
The situation is no longer dangerous.

761
00:51:49,724 --> 00:51:52,637
Hey, is Lee Chihoon playing around
over there or something?

762
00:51:52,722 --> 00:51:54,761
Heeun has been whining about
how he won't pick up his phone.

763
00:51:54,846 --> 00:51:56,120
It's driving me nuts!

764
00:52:39,978 --> 00:52:42,673
Even in this hard and
exhausting disaster site,

765
00:52:43,334 --> 00:52:45,682
why does he seem so handsome?

766
00:52:46,616 --> 00:52:49,002
I am thankful of his mere existence,

767
00:52:49,474 --> 00:52:52,422
but look at him fixing that over there!

768
00:53:01,611 --> 00:53:02,893
Is this not working?

769
00:53:02,978 --> 00:53:03,814
Yes.

770
00:53:05,884 --> 00:53:07,538
I mean, yes.

771
00:53:07,687 --> 00:53:09,775
It won't turn on.

772
00:53:10,156 --> 00:53:12,772
I heard that you are good at
fixing this kind of stuff.

773
00:53:12,857 --> 00:53:14,033
You came to the right place.

774
00:53:14,118 --> 00:53:16,359
I am good at fixing
both people and machines.

775
00:53:16,444 --> 00:53:18,154
I am pretty much good
at fixing just about anything.

776
00:53:18,354 --> 00:53:19,902
The only thing I can't seem
to fix very well...

777
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,359
...is a woman's heart.

778
00:53:22,471 --> 00:53:23,674
Oh my!

779
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:37,374
Hey!

780
00:53:40,932 --> 00:53:41,833
Let me take a breather.

781
00:53:42,304 --> 00:53:43,920
Why am I seeing this unnecessary scene...

782
00:53:44,134 --> 00:53:46,234
...in a situation like this?

783
00:53:47,284 --> 00:53:48,594
All right, break it up.

784
00:53:50,014 --> 00:53:51,414
What's with this crowd?

785
00:53:51,703 --> 00:53:53,400
Why don't you all leave already? Leave!

786
00:53:55,757 --> 00:53:57,474
Have you called your father?

787
00:53:58,264 --> 00:54:01,231
To my father, no news is great news.

788
00:54:02,227 --> 00:54:03,341
What about you?

789
00:54:04,243 --> 00:54:05,077
Right.

790
00:54:05,584 --> 00:54:07,530
You wouldn't need to call anybody
since she's already here.

791
00:54:08,144 --> 00:54:09,457
You saved on your phone bill.

792
00:54:09,962 --> 00:54:11,719
I don't know how long it's been,
since the last time,

793
00:54:11,804 --> 00:54:13,498
we've worked together
in the same military unit.

794
00:54:14,046 --> 00:54:16,578
I guess it takes an earthquake
to make that happen.

795
00:54:16,663 --> 00:54:18,189
Exactly.

796
00:54:18,502 --> 00:54:21,454
This is why you should use
this chance to get pregnant.

797
00:54:23,877 --> 00:54:28,164
Shijin, the Commander is on the phone,
asking to speak with his son-in-law...

798
00:54:40,454 --> 00:54:43,708
Hey, did you just hang up on
the Commander like that?!

799
00:54:43,793 --> 00:54:45,099
I just hung up on my dad, sir.

800
00:54:45,184 --> 00:54:46,529
"Son in law"?

801
00:54:48,979 --> 00:54:51,797
I think you may have misheard it.

802
00:54:52,184 --> 00:54:54,086
They say that you can't
trust anyone in this world.

803
00:54:54,171 --> 00:54:55,660
Is this how you guys play around?

804
00:54:55,907 --> 00:54:57,891
We never messed around together.

805
00:54:58,252 --> 00:55:00,049
Doesn't it sound like somebody is jealous?

806
00:55:00,134 --> 00:55:01,244
What are you saying now?

807
00:55:03,976 --> 00:55:04,880
On second thought.

808
00:55:05,422 --> 00:55:06,849
She's was the one who
said the wrong thing,

809
00:55:06,934 --> 00:55:08,158
but why are you taking it out on me?

810
00:55:08,243 --> 00:55:10,348
You can't seem to say anything to her.

811
00:55:10,623 --> 00:55:11,486
Geez.

812
00:55:11,879 --> 00:55:13,414
You are such a coward.

813
00:55:13,634 --> 00:55:16,640
I better go so I can get my treatment.

814
00:55:16,724 --> 00:55:18,319
My heart...

815
00:55:19,016 --> 00:55:20,407
...is extremely hurt.

816
00:55:37,144 --> 00:55:39,490
Are you the type to come into
a man's room without knocking?

817
00:55:39,574 --> 00:55:42,183
I guess somebody really was jealous.

818
00:55:43,092 --> 00:55:43,934
Keep going.

819
00:55:44,019 --> 00:55:45,258
What will you do if I was jealous?

820
00:55:45,343 --> 00:55:46,630
I'm going to give you a reward.

821
00:55:46,715 --> 00:55:47,948
A big one.

822
00:55:49,186 --> 00:55:50,503
You can look forward to it.

823
00:55:54,064 --> 00:55:56,839
Mic test. Check, one, two.

824
00:55:56,924 --> 00:55:58,474
Check, one, two, three.

825
00:55:59,572 --> 00:56:01,958
You really did fix it after all.

826
00:56:02,193 --> 00:56:03,462
This is how I treat my patients.

827
00:56:03,547 --> 00:56:05,112
Music changes a lot of things.

828
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:07,438
I will make the song selection then.

829
00:56:07,598 --> 00:56:08,562
That's fine by me.

830
00:57:00,894 --> 00:57:04,792
We're the only ones here.

831
00:57:06,376 --> 00:57:08,066
There is music, too.

832
00:57:09,401 --> 00:57:11,835
Isn't this romantic?

833
00:57:16,187 --> 00:57:18,242
How can you just not do anything?

834
00:57:18,494 --> 00:57:20,621
Don't you think that you should
be doing something by now?

835
00:57:21,486 --> 00:57:23,268
-Yes, I do
-See, what did I tell you?

836
00:57:32,283 --> 00:57:33,356
Go ahead and do it.

837
00:57:40,765 --> 00:57:42,944
I think it's time for evening roll call.

838
00:57:44,464 --> 00:57:45,471
Salute.

839
00:58:05,994 --> 00:58:07,218
What's the next song?

840
00:58:07,303 --> 00:58:08,422
I am not so sure.

841
00:58:08,638 --> 00:58:10,148
It's Dr. Kang's playlist.

842
00:58:12,804 --> 00:58:14,753
If I had known that I would
die in a foreign country,

843
00:58:14,838 --> 00:58:17,943
I would have lived a carefree life instead
of focusing on becoming a professor.

844
00:58:19,721 --> 00:58:22,027
Yoo Shijin, are you on your way?

845
00:58:23,257 --> 00:58:25,523
You're not coming.
I don't think you're coming.

846
00:58:25,852 --> 00:58:28,676
I don't think I can hold out
till you get here.

847
00:58:33,501 --> 00:58:34,529
Even so,

848
00:58:35,446 --> 00:58:39,155
you would be the first
to find me if I die.

849
00:58:43,726 --> 00:58:45,072
You know what?

850
00:58:45,796 --> 00:58:47,680
If I had known would die like this,

851
00:58:48,307 --> 00:58:52,077
I should have confessed
my true feelings to you.

852
00:58:53,704 --> 00:58:56,965
I got kissed by an amazing man.

853
00:58:57,684 --> 00:58:59,617
My heart flutters whenever
I thought about that.

854
00:59:29,191 --> 00:59:31,569
"Descendants of the Sun"

855
00:59:31,654 --> 00:59:33,570
Isn't it too early to call it a day?

856
00:59:33,655 --> 00:59:34,759
Do you want to have
ramyun with me?

857
00:59:34,844 --> 00:59:37,285
It's not like I asked for it three
times a day after each meal.

858
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:40,260
I want us to be in a romantic movie, but
it always ends up being an action movie.

859
00:59:40,344 --> 00:59:42,979
Since we've already ruined two cars,
let's ruin some lipstick as well.

860
00:59:43,064 --> 00:59:45,120
Do you still like Seo Daeyoung
after seeing him again?

861
00:59:45,204 --> 00:59:46,909
-Yes, I do.
-Seo Daeyoung, what about you?

862
00:59:46,994 --> 00:59:49,717
They kidnap kids
and keep them for sex-trafficking.

863
00:59:49,802 --> 00:59:52,803
There's more chance of getting hurt,
being around a guy with a gun.
