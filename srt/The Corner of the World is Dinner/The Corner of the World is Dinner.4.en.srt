1
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:41,280
Teacher Liang

2
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,719
This is hand-ground coffee

3
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:44,080
Added sugar and creamer specially

4
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,719
Thank you

5
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,639
Sorry, so sorry Teacher Liang

6
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,000
I'll wipe it right away

7
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,439
It's fine, I'll go to equipment dept

8
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:57,719
Sorry Teacher Liang, it was accidental

9
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,520
No worries, laptop's waterproof

10
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,360
There's always a certain flavor

11
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,240
And a unique way

12
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,319
That often reminds us

13
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,319
Of where tomorrow leads

14
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,439
And where yesterday came from

15
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,639
Here, let me

16
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,400
Nian'er, your train ticket home

17
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,599
Is it for next week?

18
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,360
Next Saturday

19
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,439
Buy it early

20
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:45,319
Tickets are hard to get these days

21
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,919
Mhm

22
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,360
I'll miss you

23
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,400
Me too

24
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,039
I'll miss you all

25
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,759
Take good care of yourself

26
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,319
Oh, inside this box

27
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,719
Are your favorite

28
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,680
From this past year

29
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,560
Movie books we collected together

30
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,759
And limited edition posters

31
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:04,159
Keep them as mementos

32
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,800
Thank you for this time together

33
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:11,520
And thank you too

34
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:14,360
Let me walk you out

35
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:16,120
Okay

36
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:37,920
Nian'er, when are you coming home?

37
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:41,480
Mom, I might not make it back

38
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:42,720
Couldn't get tickets

39
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,079
Don't lie to me

40
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:46,319
I know you never bought tickets

41
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:48,639
Don't you want to come home?

42
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,120
Nian'er...

43
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:52,040
Since your father passed

44
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,600
And I married Uncle Wang

45
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:56,240
Life's gotten better

46
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,600
Uncle Wang's a good man

47
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:00,879
He treats you well

48
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,079
Can't you treat him and his son

49
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,759
As family?

50
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:07,279
You have a home

51
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,800
Make this your real home

52
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,800
Better than drifting outside

53
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,079
Okay?

54
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:16,959
Uncle Wang's been saying

55
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:18,639
He keeps asking about you

56
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:21,439
Mom, I know

57
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,920
I'm doing fine now

58
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:25,639
Busy with work

59
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,360
My roommates take good care of me

60
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:30,720
Then...what do you eat there?

61
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,040
Made two dishes today

62
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,000
Sweet and sour ribs

63
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,279
And lotus root salad

64
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:39,879
Mom, gotta go

65
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:40,839
Someone's at the door

66
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:47,360
Coming

67
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,240
Uncle Landlord

68
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Heard they both moved out today

69
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,920
Came to check the place

70
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,720
When are you planning to

71
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,800
Uncle, I'm not moving

72
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,959
That's not what they told me

73
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:07,279
They must've misunderstood

74
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,680
I never said I'd move

75
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,319
I'll rent it alone

76
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,680
I'll pay full rent

77
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,439
My job's pretty stable

78
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:17,639
Rent won't be late

79
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,879
But I thought you'd leave too

80
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,439
Already rented it out

81
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,439
If I break contract now

82
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:23,800
I owe 1000 yuan penalty

83
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,040
I'll pay the penalty

84
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,959
This place feels like home

85
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,879
Used to it, got attached

86
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,959
Fine, prepare the contract

87
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:00,240
Can someone grab my phone?

88
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,639
Ting Jie, this is too sudden.

89
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:46,600
We don't know what to do.

90
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,200
This matter is quite complicated.

91
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,679
Simply put, investors pulled out.

92
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,279
Our funding chain is completely broken.

93
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,039
Ting Jie, in such short time...

94
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,559
I can't possibly find another job.

95
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:57,919
Sorry, Nian'er.

96
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,200
The company is really dissolving.

97
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,600
I can barely take care of myself now.

98
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,759
Oh, by the way...

99
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:04,799
About severance and salary details...

100
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:06,159
Just contact accounting directly.

101
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:07,279
You won't be shortchanged.

102
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,559
Ting Jie, thank you for your hard work.

103
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,200
There's really nothing left.

104
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:16,759
Sue if you want to.

105
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,879
Ting Jie told me to come to you.

106
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:20,679
She promised my salary and severance.

107
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,279
Go ahead and sue then.

108
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:23,679
Those were Ting Jie's exact words.

109
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,919
What are you doing?

110
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:52,000
Can I post this here?

111
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,320
No ads allowed there.

112
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,240
Then I'll put it below.

113
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,039
No, against rules. Take it down.

114
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:24,759
Spend 15 yuan, add 3 more...

115
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:26,759
...get a 9-yuan drink.

116
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:27,679
Interested?

117
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:29,679
No thanks.

118
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,639
Okay.

119
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:34,360
Need it heated?

120
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,919
Excuse me...

121
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:39,519
Can I post a rental ad there?

122
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,240
There?

123
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:45,120
Thanks.

124
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,840
No problem.

125
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:47,840
No, against regulations.

126
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,960
Please heat it up.

127
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:56,559
I'm not going.

128
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:57,759
Meeting my boyfriend this afternoon.

129
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:00,279
Heard the advisor will soon...

130
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:01,519
...drag you into organizing events.

131
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:04,399
Won't be so free then.

132
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,600
Let's rent a place together.

133
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,799
Good idea.

134
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,720
Wow, this cake is adorable!

135
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,279
But it's too expensive.

136
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,279
We could split the cost and try it.

137
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:18,519
Never mind, let's eat at the cafeteria.

138
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,399
Alright.

139
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:20,960
Hey, wait.

140
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:23,120
What do you want?

141
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:25,879
I have a room for rent.

142
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:27,120
Interested in seeing it?

143
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,919
The room...

144
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,840
My place is great -

145
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,960
...warm in winter, cool in summer.

146
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,879
Close to your school too -

147
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:33,120
...just 5 minutes walk.

148
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,120
Let's go see it then.

149
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:37,559
Let's go.

150
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:39,720
Wait a minute.

151
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,519
Have you decided?

152
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:48,960
The room's nice...

153
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,080
But between us two...

154
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,679
...we can only pay one person's rent.

155
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:53,559
You know...

156
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,679
We're students with little money.

157
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:57,600
Can't even afford cake.

158
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,559
But I'm not doing well either.

159
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,519
Just got laid off.

160
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:05,080
No savings.

161
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,360
Think about it.

162
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,399
We don't absolutely need it.

163
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,360
Rents have dropped around here.

164
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,720
Plenty of vacancies too.

165
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:13,919
You won't easily...

166
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:15,759
...find roommates soon, right?

167
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:19,519
That's true, but...

168
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:21,080
Sorry...

169
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,120
Hello?

170
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,840
Ms. Liang?

171
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,759
Your package is at the door.

172
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,759
Package?

173
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,720
Oh, okay.

174
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,720
Think it over.

175
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,919
I'll get my package.

176
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,879
Surprise!

177
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,399
What's wrong?

178
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,080
Why aren't you replying to my WeChat?

179
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,360
Are you ghosting me?

180
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,919
Trying to be like Du Fei or He Shuhuan?

181
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:08,720
Didn't you tell me last time

182
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,080
your roommate was moving out?

183
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,639
So I planned to come keep you company

184
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:12,919
Officially moved in today

185
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:15,600
I rented the apartment below yours

186
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,080
Right downstairs

187
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:22,080
You just came like this?

188
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,360
Your luggage?

189
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,799
Sent by courier, hasn't arrived yet

190
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,200
I came out first

191
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,799
Let's be clear first

192
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:38,320
We don't share apartments with guys

193
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:39,440
No worries

194
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,759
You're here to rent, right?

195
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:42,440
Sorry about this

196
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:44,600
I'm taking over this whole place

197
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:45,840
You two better leave now

198
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,360
My apologies

199
00:13:57,919 --> 00:13:59,600
Peng, are you really moving in?

200
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,399
Absolutely

201
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,000
I'll stay with you days, go downstairs at night

202
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,000
I'll cover rent for both rooms

203
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,799
Share the joy, I'll take the hardship

204
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:11,759
But for no reason

205
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:13,360
paying rent for two extra rooms

206
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,360
and adding half-hour to your commute

207
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,600
Doesn't seem right

208
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,000
Then I'll make it up elsewhere

209
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,159
What do you mean?

210
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:24,799
Oh right

211
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,639
What is it?

212
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,559
This contains my most important things

213
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,720
My laptop

214
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:40,120
Keep it safe for me

215
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,799
Lots of important stuff inside

216
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,559
Keep it waterproof, dustproof and...

217
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:45,759
No, drop-proof

218
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,840
Don't worry

219
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,960
This portion of "wife tofu"

220
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,279
isn't enough for both of us

221
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,559
It's Mapo Tofu

222
00:14:59,039 --> 00:14:59,679
Let's go

223
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,720
Where to?

224
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,480
Eat out

225
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,279
Here

226
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:17,679
Haven't had this in ages

227
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:18,799
Try mine

228
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:24,200
Good?

229
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,120
Same old flavor

230
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:27,720
Some vinegar

231
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:28,919
Just a little, come on

232
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,720
Want to try mine?

233
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,320
Mine has scallions?

234
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,519
Let me pick them out

235
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,799
Tasty, right?

236
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,759
Wait a sec

237
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:37,679
So full

238
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,360
Off work, let's go

239
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,159
Let's sit a while longer

240
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,399
Okay

241
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:15,920
Hey, did you take the wrong box?

242
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,640
This one's full of kitchenware

243
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,720
Oh, must've been a mix-up

244
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:21,799
What now?

245
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:22,920
Come back and get it

246
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:25,160
We're already on the train

247
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,279
Keep the kitchenware

248
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:28,920
But I can't cook

249
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,039
Learn! You're so smart

250
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,519
I haven't found work yet

251
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:42,519
And Peng's so picky about food

252
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:46,039
Might as well learn cooking

253
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,200
Save on living costs

254
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,319
And eat healthier together

255
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,000
We'll get through this

256
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,759
Peel potatoes, slice and julienne

257
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,319
No problem, I can do this

258
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,839
Slice and julienne

259
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,359
Can't make complex dishes

260
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:23,599
Start with simple ones

261
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,240
These seeds

262
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,240
Should all be removed, right?

263
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,759
Scallion sections

264
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,519
How long's a "section"?

265
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,240
Seems cooked

266
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,440
Just stir twice more

267
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:37,960
My first ever cooked dish

268
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,559
Dinner's ready

269
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,359
Must post this on Moments

270
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,240
Stop taking photos

271
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,559
These shredded potatoes look awful

272
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,039
No they don't

273
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:00,039
This is Nian'er's first-ever cooked dish

274
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:01,480
Gotta show it off

275
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:05,960
Okay

276
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,680
Let's eat

277
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:10,440
Done, posted it

278
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:13,240
Come on, quick! Try some

279
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,000
Eat more

280
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,519
You have some too

281
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:27,839
I'll eat too

282
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Perfect with rice

283
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,000
Just looks a bit ugly

284
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:40,920
Not ugly at all

285
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:42,920
These peppers aren't spicy, try them

286
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,200
Why'd you stop eating?

287
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,599
Promise me something, okay?

288
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:09,839
What is it?

289
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,319
No matter what problems we face

290
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,359
Let's never separate

291
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,519
Okay

292
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:44,480
Let's try something different today

293
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,079
Take the eggs out when 70-80% cooked

294
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,519
They'll cook more later

295
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:52,759
Don't fry them completely

296
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,440
The secret to this dish

297
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,880
Isn't frying but braising

298
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,039
Add some sugar

299
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,759
To balance the tomato's acidity

300
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:22,720
You look beautiful cooking

301
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:25,519
Go wait outside

302
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:26,480
It'll be ready soon

303
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:41,559
What's wrong today?

304
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,599
At work I'm like this tomato

305
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:49,920
Stir-fried into mush

306
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,359
I got laid off

307
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,200
It's okay

308
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,400
Their loss for firing you

309
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:10,920
As long as we're together

310
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,200
I fear no hardship

311
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:10,640
I graduated from a top school

312
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,279
Was mid-level at a big company

313
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:17,680
Made six figures right after college

314
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:26,960
Now I've been job hunting so long

315
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,119
Still can't find anything

316
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:36,640
I...

317
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,160
I know you're feeling down

318
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,519
But you must believe

319
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:49,319
This is all temporary

320
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:52,079
I feel I've tried my hardest

321
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:10,839
Can't I survive without the 996 grind?

322
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:14,359
Is it really impossible?

323
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:24,599
This isn't anyone's fault

324
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,240
And it's not about effort

325
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:30,119
You just need patience now

326
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,920
And don't be so hard on...

327
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:42,279
Let's eat

328
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:02,440
Everything in the kitchen

329
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,039
Like old friends returning

330
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:08,920
Slowly but surely gathers around me

331
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,759
I'm mastering my kitchen

332
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:15,880
But wonder

333
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:19,839
If I can master my future

334
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:35,559
Nian'er

335
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:36,279
Yeah?

336
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:37,920
I'm going out

337
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,039
Come back soon

338
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,839
Made your favorite pork in chili oil

339
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:43,319
Okay

340
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:42,279
"The number you dialed is powered off"

341
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,480
Du Peng?

342
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:52,279
But eating spicy pork for late snack

343
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:53,720
Seems sinful, no?

344
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,960
Not at all

345
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,680
No way

346
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,920
What? What did you say?

347
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,880
Said she nodded when asked if you're together

348
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,680
No no

349
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,720
She thought about it

350
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,039
I misheard as Yin Zhanqi
