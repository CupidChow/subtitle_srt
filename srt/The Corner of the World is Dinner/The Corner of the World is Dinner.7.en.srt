00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,439
Hello

2
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:55,400
This is Li Zhenggui's

3
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,840
Art Livestream

4
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,840
Welcome, welcome, welcome

5
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,599
New friends, feel free to follow

6
00:02:58,599 --> 00:02:59,199
New friends, feel free to follow

7
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:00,120
And set up a fan sign

8
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:28,719
Let me say it again

9
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:30,759
This is an art livestream

10
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,080
Not your nightclub

11
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,080
I'm here to sell paintings

12
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,960
Not here to perform

13
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,680
Thank you

14
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:02,560
You're the ones acting all righteous

15
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,520
If you like it so much

16
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,080
black stockings and pole dancing

17
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,240
why not go dance yourselves

18
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,199
Start your own livestream

19
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,240
I'll come over

20
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,319
and send you gifts

21
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,039
How about that

22
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,000
How did I break any livestream rules

23
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,480
If people insult me

24
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,680
I can't talk back?

25
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,800
Zhenggui

26
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:37,120
Show a little respect

27
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,399
for my hard work

28
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,319
I got up early

29
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:40,959
This was a lot of trouble

30
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:44,879
What's wrong with you

31
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:47,160
You've been down since yesterday

32
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:54,480
I'm going through

33
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,759
the biggest turning point of my life

34
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,759
What kind of turning point is that serious

35
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:03,720
I don't want to be an artist anymore

36
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:05,920
I want to live an ordinary life

37
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:06,920
Keep it simple

38
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,120
You

39
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:11,519
Except you don't have to work every day

40
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,879
How is your life not ordinary

41
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:16,680
Livestreaming is work too, okay

42
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,360
I just don't want to do it now

43
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:28,879
As an artist every day

44
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,199
I face online trolls

45
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,240
I really

46
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:32,759
suffer

47
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,000
Why not try a side job

48
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,560
to take your mind off things

49
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:41,680
Hui

50
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,480
Can you help me look

51
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,160
I

52
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,240
I want to try something new

53
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,839
The coffee shop downstairs from our office

54
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:55,759
is hiring a barista

55
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,519
Want me to ask for you

56
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,959
Am I going to be a barista

57
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,000
Miss

58
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,519
You haven't even started working

59
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:10,720
I'm heading to work now

60
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,680
Coffee

61
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,519
Done

62
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:42,079
Your coffee

63
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:42,720
Thank you

64
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,600
Take care

65
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,279
Welcome

66
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:46,439
Sit anywhere

67
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,720
Hello

68
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,839
Would you like to order anything

69
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,160
Zhang Hui referred me

70
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:03,920
You're Li Zhenggui

71
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,720
That's right

72
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:07,279
Do you know your interview

73
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:08,879
is two hours late

74
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,279
It's already ten o'clock

75
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,720
I've opened for business

76
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,279
Did you forget to set an alarm

77
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:14,480
Or did something hold you up

78
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,439
No, I never set alarms

79
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,600
I think waking up naturally

80
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,040
is better for my health

81
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,680
You just woke up

82
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,360
Can I try

83
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,600
your coffee while I'm here

84
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,639
To wake myself up

85
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,439
Ma'am

86
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:29,160
You know you're here for an interview, right

87
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,480
Of course

88
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,680
Did you know

89
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:41,040
Coffee beans

90
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,480
are actually coffee cherry seeds

91
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,639
And when ripe

92
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,199
they can be red or purple

93
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,120
But different varieties

94
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,839
can be yellow or orange too

95
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,560
A latte, please

96
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,720
Okay

97
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,720
Work hard

98
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,480
Got it

99
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,560
What's so special about that

100
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,160
It's natural

101
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,160
Here

102
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,839
Your latte

103
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,519
Thank you

104
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,879
Looks pretty good

105
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,240
Not bad

106
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:38,720
Give it a like

107
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:39,759
Sure

108
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,120
Why is my coffee different from theirs

109
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,039
Are you discriminating against customers

110
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:47,159
Sir

111
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,120
No, no, no

112
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,200
You ordered an Americano

113
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,720
He ordered a latte

114
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,720
Lattes come with latte art

115
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:55,600
Latte art is an art form

116
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,279
Art is unique

117
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,440
So it's not about you

118
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,360
Why not try a latte yourself

119
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:03,159
I want exactly what he has

120
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:04,440
Alright

121
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,360
Why do I feel like you're here to perform

122
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:14,720
Perform

123
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:27,159
Hui

124
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:28,360
You don't look well

125
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,279
Are you okay

126
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:31,120
I don't know what's wrong lately

127
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,320
I'm sleepy all day and night

128
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:35,360
Maybe I'm getting old

129
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,519
Can't stay up late anymore

130
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,720
I was just about to find you

131
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,960
These are the new resumes

132
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,720
I've screened them

133
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,279
Take a look

134
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,519
See if any fit your department

135
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,519
Alright, thanks

136
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:43,159
Okay

137
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,200
Nian

138
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,240
I'm working overtime again today

139
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,559
Can't go grocery shopping

140
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,519
That's just how it is

141
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:08,879
I'll message her on WeChat

142
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:12,039
Just mentioning her annoys me

143
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,279
The coffee shop manager just called me

144
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:16,279
Said Li Zhenggui was fired

145
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:24,200
That's just her personality

146
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,159
Nothing you can do

147
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,240
Okay

148
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,559
Hui

149
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:43,519
Coming, coming

150
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,919
Come again

151
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,519
Take care on your way.

152
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,799
Zhenggui

153
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:03,440
You came to buy groceries today.

154
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,519
That's right.

155
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:06,159
The other two don't have time today.

156
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,559
It's fine.

157
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:08,919
I remember before,

158
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,240
they never let you buy groceries.

159
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:11,919
That was before.

160
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:12,720
Now, without me,

161
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,960
they'd go hungry.

162
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:20,120
Can you stop staring at them like that?

163
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:20,960
The way you stare

164
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,639
makes me feel uneasy.

165
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:24,840
Uncle

166
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:26,919
Did you forget what I do?

167
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,600
I'm an artist.

168
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,120
So I'm admiring

169
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,919
nature's creations.

170
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:33,840
Beautiful.

171
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,519
No matter how beautiful,

172
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,720
won't it end up in your stomach tonight?

173
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,320
It's not the same.

174
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:43,279
There's brilliance in that moment of life.

175
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:45,519
Sixty-one jin.

176
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,279
Boss

177
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,679
Don't worry.

178
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:04,960
With me here,

179
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,080
not a single cat

180
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,480
can get near these shrimp.

181
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:12,840
Zhenggui

182
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,679
How about you watch the stall for me?

183
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:16,919
No problem, no problem.

184
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:18,879
But, Uncle,

185
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:20,399
what I really want to say is

186
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,240
the freshness of these shrimp

187
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,279
decreases over time.

188
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,759
So most people

189
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:31,360
wait until the market is about to close

190
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,279
to sell at a lower price.

191
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:36,519
But I'm not taking advantage.

192
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:38,559
I just think it's fair

193
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,840
six thirty.

194
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,720
At six thirty,

195
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:44,720
if these shrimp aren't sold,

196
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,080
sell them to me for half price.

197
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,919
Thirty.

198
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,799
Deal.

199
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:55,919
Wait, you said

200
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:56,879
no backing out.

201
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,039
Put the gun away.

202
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,480
Carrying this is really tiring.

203
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,759
I wonder why my art journey

204
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:15,159
is so full of obstacles.

205
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:19,559
Living in a place with these red and green fabrics,

206
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,080
how can I become a master?

207
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:23,279
Zhenggui

208
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,639
It's really tough for you.

209
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,720
I'm back.

210
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:43,519
Look how much I brought.

211
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:44,639
So many shrimp!

212
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:45,559
How much did it cost?

213
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:46,720
Didn't go over budget.

214
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,519
You're making us a feast today.

215
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,399
Of course.

216
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,879
I'll put them in the kitchen first.

217
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,720
What are you doing?

218
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:17,240
I think our neighborhood committee

219
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:19,279
has poor taste.

220
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:20,639
When I came back,

221
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:21,919
I saw those cloth strips

222
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,440
and almost cried.

223
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,879
Of course.

224
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,759
Our Li Zhenggui is a true artist.

225
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,840
Our ordinary stuff

226
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,519
could never impress you.

227
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:35,559
What do you mean?

228
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:37,519
Did I offend you?

229
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:43,519
How's the coffee shop job

230
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,080
going today?

231
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,440
Pretty good.

232
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:55,080
I think the manager is nice.

233
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,919
But

234
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,360
all the customers today

235
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,759
were amazed by my latte art.

236
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:01,840
Totally impressed.

237
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,279
They even wanted to tip me.

238
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:04,679
Who am I?

239
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,080
I'm Li Zhenggui.

240
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:07,679
I never accept tips.

241
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:10,159
I just want my art to be appreciated.

242
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:17,720
Who is it?

243
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:22,360
You're home?

244
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,000
Yu Dama

245
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,679
May I come in?

246
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:24,480
Sure, sure.

247
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,440
Please change your shoes.

248
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,039
Change shoes.

249
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:35,759
Your house

250
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,440
has the same layout as mine.

251
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:39,360
It's beautiful.

252
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,720
Solid wood.

253
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,519
Writing desk.

254
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,440
Looks like an antique.

255
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,720
Chopping table.

256
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,440
Chopping table, huh?

257
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,320
I know this one.

258
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:55,519
We use this to feed our cat at home.

259
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:56,480
Cat bell.

260
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,519
Cat bell.

261
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,039
Timer, Dama.

262
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:00,320
Timer.

263
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:02,080
So creative!

264
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:05,559
Your house is really nice.

265
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,519
It feels so cozy.

266
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,360
Your house

267
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,080
has the same layout as ours,

268
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,080
but there's something

269
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,720
it looks truly grand.

270
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,000
So beautiful.

271
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,080
Dama, why don't you have a seat?

272
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:21,759
This sofa

273
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:22,720
is so soft.

274
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,320
Yu Dama, you're here.

275
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:29,039
All three of you are here.

276
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,080
I was just passing by.

277
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,919
Came to take a look.

278
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:31,600
Alright.

279
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:37,320
Yu Dama

280
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:38,840
You're not here to

281
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,639
put up those cloth strips

282
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,240
in our house, are you?

283
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,440
Actually,

284
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:46,720
I came to talk about that.

285
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:48,519
No, please don't.

286
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:49,440
Because I think

287
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,240
Zhenggui

288
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,159
Let Dama finish what she's saying.

289
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,480
Here's the situation.

290
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,720
The higher-ups assigned our community

291
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,759
an important task.

292
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,160
They want our neighborhood committee

293
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,279
to promote Jiangzhou's tourist spots.

294
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:10,359
Everyone

295
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,200
has been searching for a skilled artist.

296
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,480
We hope for long-term help

297
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,079
with designing posters and banners.

298
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,920
So our street

299
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,279
looks more refined and cultured.

300
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,680
And more beautiful.

301
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:27,119
So you're saying

302
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:30,039
you want a professional

303
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:32,119
to design these long-term?

304
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,720
That's right.

305
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:36,680
You're one of the talents we have in mind.

306
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:38,119
Me? I...

307
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:39,519
Are you joking?

308
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:41,720
How could I joke about this?

309
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:44,559
We've visited your art livestream.

310
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,519
We all admire your work.

311
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:48,000
Everyone gave you high praise.

312
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,680
We think you're truly talented.

313
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,640
And you have youthful energy.

314
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,720
Plus, you're creative.

315
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:54,920
Li Zhenggui,

316
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:56,000
finally someone

317
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,680
truly appreciates your art.

318
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,359
So my talent

319
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:02,200
isn't just for the livestream.

320
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,519
It can help others too.

321
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,400
Alright then.

322
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,079
It's settled.

323
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,240
Take care, Yu Dama.

324
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,000
Oh, right—

325
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,920
There's one more thing.

326
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:13,160
Today is Safety Awareness Day.

327
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,039
This is an old building.

328
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:16,640
Since I'm here,

329
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,960
let me check your kitchen.

330
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,799
Take a look at the gas and such.

331
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,480
Check the safety measures.

332
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,000
Please.

333
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,160
It's very clean in here.

334
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,279
The gas stove is well maintained.

335
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,039
But don't get complacent.

336
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:41,160
You must keep safety a top priority.

337
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,920
No carelessness allowed.

338
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,680
Yu Dama,

339
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:46,119
wait a moment.

340
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:51,519
Please take this.

341
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,519
We bought too much.

342
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:53,680
Help us use some up.

343
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,839
No, no, that's not right.

344
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:55,720
Why not?

345
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,079
These shrimp are delicious.

346
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:58,920
If we wait till tomorrow, they'll spoil.

347
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,720
Alright then.

348
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:00,960
I'll take these shrimp

349
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,519
to the senior care kitchen.

350
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,920
I'll thank you on their behalf.

351
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,079
No need to thank me.

352
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:08,799
I just asked you to help Li Zhenggui find a job this afternoon.

353
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,079
And you found one by tonight.

354
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:11,519
I should be thanking you.

355
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:12,559
Did I play my part well?

356
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:13,519
Did I give myself away?

357
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,200
All good.

358
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,160
Your place is really clean.

359
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,359
You keep it spotless.

360
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:19,440
Hope you keep up

361
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,079
this spotless spirit.

362
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:21,920
No need to see me out.

363
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,279
I'm taking the shrimp now.

364
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:25,079
Take care, Yu Dama.

365
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,640
I guarded those shrimp all day,

366
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,680
how could you just give them away?

367
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:36,920
Sorry!

368
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,480
Just think of it as

369
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,519
a contribution to the senior care kitchen.

370
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,839
Don't be mad.

371
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,839
So what are we eating tonight?

372
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:45,680
To celebrate your new job,

373
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,359
we're having a feast tonight.

374
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,000
Burgundy Beef Stew.

375
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,839
That'll do.

376
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,119
Red wine beef stew

377
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,000
originated in Burgundy, France.

378
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:13,880
There,

379
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,799
they're famous for Pinot Noir red wine.

380
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,440
Legend has it

381
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,960
Burgundy farmers

382
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,240
after a hard day's work

383
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,440
would buy cheaper,

384
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,440
tougher cuts of beef

385
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,359
that are harder to cook.

386
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,480
They'd slow-cook them in local red wine

387
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:34,559
until the beef turned tender.

388
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:38,359
The wine gives the beef a unique flavor.

389
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:41,039
Snow falls outside,

390
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,880
while the family gathers inside,

391
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:48,559
enjoying a rich, comforting dinner.

392
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,240
They'd add root vegetables

393
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,839
to soak up the hearty gravy.

394
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:33,599
Over time,

395
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,200
this affordable, tasty dish

396
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,680
became popular across France.

397
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,440
But what made it loved worldwide

398
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,319
was an American TV chef—

399
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:24,319
Julia Child.

400
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,640
I first learned about it

401
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,839
from my favorite actress

402
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:34,559
Meryl Streep's biopic

403
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,559
Julie & Julia.

404
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,880
Julie, an office worker,

405
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,920
struggles with a fast-paced, unrewarding job.

406
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:44,640
Her kitchen becomes her only escape.

407
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,839
With her husband's support,

408
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:49,039
she decides to spend a year

409
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:53,039
cooking every recipe from Julia's book.

410
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,920
She starts a blog

411
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,960
to document her daily progress.

412
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,279
She hopes that through cooking

413
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,519
she'll find her true self

414
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,160
and rediscover her love for life.

415
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:09,039
There's a line in the film

416
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,799
that's cheesy but heartfelt:

417
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,200
You are the butter to my bread,

418
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:19,079
you are the breath of my life.

419
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,240
You're the butter on my bread,

420
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,720
the breath in my life.

421
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:36,880
It smells amazing.

422
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,720
I'm going crazy.

423
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:40,920
This wine must be expensive.

424
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,680
Dinner isn't over budget again, is it?

425
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,599
The wine is Li Zhenggui's private stash.

426
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:45,599
So it's not over budget.

427
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,680
Alright.

428
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,880
Then tonight,

429
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,000
since you used my wine

430
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,200
as your cooking wine,

431
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:57,640
I'll eat a little more.

432
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,640
No matter what happened today,

433
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,720
when night comes,

434
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,599
we deserve the best dinner.

435
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,759
Cheers to dinner.

436
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,240
Cheers to Li Zhenggui's new job.

437
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:15,960
Let's eat!

438
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,240
I want to eat rice.

439
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,200
Pumpkin counts as a staple.

440
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,039
I want rice.

441
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,119
Then I want a bowl too.

442
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,839
So our barista—

443
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,319
Was work smooth today?

444
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:18,599
It went well.

445
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,559
But I think...

446
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,200
The community committee needs me now.

447
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:26,119
I think I should

448
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:28,400
use all my talent and skills

449
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:29,640
to serve others.

450
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:33,920
Should I go to the café tomorrow

451
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,599
and help you quit your job?

452
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,799
No need.

453
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:40,039
I can handle small things myself.

454
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:41,160
No trouble.

455
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,799
Can't be helped.

456
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,200
What can I say? Everyone loves me, right?

457
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,160
So talented.

458
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:49,559
Zhenggui.

459
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:51,319
Actually, whatever we do,

460
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:53,240
we have to rely on our own effort.

461
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,359
Don't forget—

462
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:56,160
financial independence.

463
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,079
Got it.

464
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,440
We all know you're capable.

465
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:01,960
So with this new job,

466
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,640
you'll give it your all.

467
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:06,119
Definitely.

468
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:29,960
Hello, everyone.

469
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:31,640
Friends in the Art Livestream,

470
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,960
it's Little Zhenggui.

471
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,839
Any fans out there?

472
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,240
If there are fans,

473
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,000
remember to send some gifts.

474
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:55,200
Alright.

475
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,519
So today I want to

476
00:29:57,519 --> 00:29:59,519
officially announce to everyone

477
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,200
this is my last livestream.

478
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,359
Thank you all for your support.

479
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,440
I'll miss you.

480
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:09,880
Bye-bye.
