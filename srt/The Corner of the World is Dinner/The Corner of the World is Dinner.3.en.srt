1
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:36,599
Teacher Guo

2
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:38,400
This food critic Ego

3
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,919
about Ratatouille

4
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:40,919
I think we can totally

5
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,159
follow the direction you mentioned

6
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,240
Let's try again

7
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,840
We might get unexpected results

8
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,400
Okay, let's do it again

9
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:47,800
I'm ready, okay

10
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,960
Sound speak

11
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:52,199
Ready, action

12
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,439
Not everyone

13
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:56,680
can become a great artist

14
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,960
But a great artist

15
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,479
can come from anywhere

16
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,759
Cut

17
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,240
Teacher Liang, what's wrong?

18
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,159
It's not your fault

19
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:06,759
We have a minor technical issue

20
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:07,960
Please take a break

21
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,199
Okay, okay

22
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,199
Maintenance department?

23
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:16,039
This is Liang Nian'er from audio

24
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:17,520
Our studio is leaking

25
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,240
Can Teacher Gao Lei come over?

26
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,319
Okay, thank you

27
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:27,680
Teacher Liang

28
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,039
I heard you on the phone

29
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:30,879
Is there an equipment issue?

30
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,080
Let me help fix it

31
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,479
No need, just a small issue

32
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,439
I can handle it

33
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,879
No thanks

34
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,080
Nian'er

35
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,439
To enjoy the best food

36
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:20,399
No eating before dinner

37
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:22,879
Hui

38
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,120
Hey, why are you still here?

39
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,759
I saw you hadn't come down

40
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:31,720
I was waiting for you

41
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,639
So I came up

42
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:35,519
We can talk tomorrow

43
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,399
Here's the thing

44
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:40,040
After dinner at your place

45
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,560
I...

46
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,600
Right, I almost forgot

47
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,600
I haven't thanked you yet

48
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,519
Now that you mention it

49
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:49,920
I was too abrupt last time

50
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,480
Didn't consider your feelings

51
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:53,480
The gift was too expensive

52
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,000
It was nothing, no need to thank me

53
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,600
I consider you a friend

54
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:58,120
That's why I'm more grateful

55
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,360
Hui

56
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:11,399
Actually, I've always liked you

57
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,079
You're beautiful

58
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,079
Talented and filial

59
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,959
So I actually want to

60
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,040
work with you

61
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,199
I'm happy too

62
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,879
Then why that day

63
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,639
ask me to pretend to be your boyfriend?

64
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,319
Why not ask someone else?

65
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:41,560
Yi Han

66
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,000
Last time I was impolite

67
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,040
I talked with my parents

68
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,959
They accept my single status

69
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,600
And right now

70
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,000
I can't start a new relationship

71
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,480
If I gave you the wrong impression

72
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,680
I apologize

73
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,360
Here's the thing

74
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,279
My roommates

75
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,240
They all like you

76
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,319
Especially Zhen Gui

77
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,800
She says you're a good brother

78
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:21,800
There'll be other times

79
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:34,040
I'm so unlucky

80
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:36,079
Got a huge pimple

81
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,720
Ruins my livestream

82
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,079
Designed so many clothes

83
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:41,480
But only sold one

84
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:44,639
Hui, take a look

85
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,600
What happened to you two?

86
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,240
Got hurt fixing equipment

87
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:02,240
Cut myself peeling apples

88
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,759
Should've checked the almanac

89
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,399
This year's unlucky

90
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,120
Stop gloating

91
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,639
Careful

92
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,199
Give it to me

93
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:21,000
Put it here

94
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,240
This reduces swelling

95
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,680
My foot hurts when I move

96
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,839
My hand too

97
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,519
Can't work now

98
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,079
My injury is nothing serious.

99
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,680
I've already applied medicine and bandaged it.

100
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:49,439
Wait, little Zhen Gui.

101
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,600
You consider acne an injury?

102
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,639
Of course! It hurts a lot.

103
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,560
Come on, cheer up you two.

104
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,399
Look at how you're acting.

105
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,120
I was just thinking.

106
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,240
What should we do about dinner tonight?

107
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,720
What's there to consider?

108
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,720
Of course I'll cook.

109
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:10,759
No.

110
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:12,279
Wait, why not?

111
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,680
My injury is on my face.

112
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,000
But my hands and feet work fine.

113
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,079
You, stop causing trouble.

114
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,839
Let's just order takeout.

115
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,800
I'll do it.

116
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,639
It looks okay.

117
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,440
It is okay.

118
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:05,200
This fish clearly died in the water.

119
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,679
Then got fished out.

120
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,480
Our carefully selected five-star takeout.

121
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:23,720
I told you.

122
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,639
Takeout is unhealthy and expensive.

123
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,799
Please don't forget.

124
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,879
We have a grand goal.

125
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,720
My main job is design.

126
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,080
Is there any difference between design and cooking?

127
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,120
They're both forms of art.

128
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,120
Good-looking food can't taste that bad.

129
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,919
Not everyone.

130
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:10,679
Can become a great artist.

131
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,720
But every great artist.

132
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,919
Can come from anywhere.

133
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:17,840
Not everyone.

134
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,080
Can become a great artist.

135
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,440
But every great artist.

136
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,879
Could come from anywhere.

137
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:27,840
What exactly are you trying to say?

138
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,600
I've decided.

139
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,639
Ms. Li Zhen Gui.

140
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,600
Tonight you should boldly give it a try.

141
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,399
I'll go buy groceries.

142
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,960
No, even if Nian'er lets you cook.

143
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,919
I won't allow you to go shopping.

144
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,000
If you let her shop.

145
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
She'd bring the whole supermarket back.

146
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,440
Our daily food budget is only 100 yuan.

147
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:53,480
I absolutely won't let you splurge.

148
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,320
This is my bottom line.

149
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,240
Fine, no shopping then.

150
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,879
As a future master chef.

151
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,240
Even if there's just one vegetable left in the fridge.

152
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,840
I can still make a feast.

153
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,120
Fine, use what's in the fridge.

154
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,080
But... but I have one condition.

155
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:20,519
You two.

156
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,480
Need to go rest in your rooms.

157
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:23,679
Recover from your injuries.

158
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:27,279
Stop hovering and giving orders.

159
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,879
Nagging like old ladies.

160
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,039
Go.

161
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,279
Slow down, my hand isn't working well.

162
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,080
Recovering, recovering.

163
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,200
How to prepare beef slices.

164
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:02,039
Tuna.

165
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,039
That should do it.

166
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,120
What's the big deal.

167
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,759
Today I'll make the world's most delicious.

168
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:31,159
Clay Pot Beef with Chopped Chilies.

169
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,960
Haven't even started yet.

170
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,440
And already making a big fuss.

171
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:32,960
Zhen Gui.

172
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,759
Please don't put raw eggs.

173
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:35,960
In the microwave.

174
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,600
They'll explode.

175
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,720
Got it, old lady.

176
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,480
Old lady, how about that?

177
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,519
Understood, old lady.

178
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,440
Dinner's ready!

179
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:35,720
This is my Clay Pot Beef with Chopped Chilies.

180
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,000
Steamed eggs, tuna kimchi fried rice.

181
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,680
Dig in.

182
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,200
Ouch, my finger.

183
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,759
It's poisoned.

184
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,240
How is it?

185
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:51,400
Looks strong.

186
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,640
Tastes mild.

187
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:56,799
But quite addictive.

188
00:20:57,119 --> 00:20:58,519
Meaning.

189
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,759
Not bad.

190
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,319
Can you taste a hint of apple?

191
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:21,200
Hmm, a little.

192
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,720
Because recently.

193
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,200
She said she's been craving apples.

194
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,160
So today I specifically.

195
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,920
Added some apple.

196
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,519
Who taught you this fried rice?

197
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:44,400
Does it taste wrong?

198
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:48,079
There's a magical flavor here.

199
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,960
Can you teach me how?

200
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,279
Secret.

201
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,759
This fried rice is delicious.

202
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,000
This fried rice is delicious.

203
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:06,319
Don't just pick out the tuna though.

204
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:16,319
Take this egg...

205
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,880
and mix it with the rice.

206
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:22,200
Mix them together - so good!

207
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,519
Impressive.

208
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:15,799
Here's to...

209
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:23,880
To my first dinner for everyone.

210
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,440
To dinner!

211
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:38,720
What's your secret for these dishes?

212
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,759
Well, there is a secret.

213
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:43,200
I think...

214
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:45,039
Only rigid people...

215
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,759
follow recipes exactly.

216
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,920
The world isn't static.

217
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:56,440
We should live each day...

218
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,480
to its fullest.

219
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:01,119
Make life colorful and rich.

220
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:03,640
That's why dinner matters so much.

221
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:08,359
Zhen Gui, I'm really impressed.

222
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,799
But...

223
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,279
Even though I feel accomplished today,

224
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,759
you should keep cooking dinners.

225
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,960
Since when are you so humble?

226
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:25,160
Growth!

227
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,519
Understand? Growth!

228
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:29,359
Have you grown lately?

229
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,240
And you...

230
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,720
What about that guy from work...

231
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:32,680
Yin Zhanqi?

232
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,400
Wasn't he pursuing you?

233
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,160
He seems nice.

234
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,279
How's that going?

235
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:47,240
Anyway...

236
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,119
I once saw a food show...

237
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:50,960
called "Meishi Zongdongyuan".

238
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,240
There was a quote...

239
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,000
I found interesting.

240
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:58,680
People keep looking backward...

241
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:01,680
and miss what's ahead.

242
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,039
Turns out we're not today's victims...

243
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:35,519
The kitchen is.

244
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,359
And my new iPhone.

245
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,200
What happened to it?

246
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:46,160
Fell into the beef dish!

247
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,519
Hence the apple flavor.

248
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,119
Li Zhen Gui!

249
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,880
Ah! Ah! Ah!

250
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,799
Whatever!

251
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,440
For this wonderful dinner...

252
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,279
It's all worth it.
