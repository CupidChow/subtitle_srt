1
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,400
I've slept for eight hours.

2
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:57,400
But I'm still so sleepy.

3
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,360
Sis, help me turn it off.

4
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:28,240
Nian'er

5
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:29,960
No,

6
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,639
I feel like every morning

7
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,439
I just did this yesterday morning.

8
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,960
Why has it turned into

9
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,120
having to do this every morning?

10
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,759
It's a Calorie-Burning Day every morning.

11
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:41,039
You only get up early once a week.

12
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,280
What are you complaining about?

13
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:44,199
For our dinner,

14
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:45,960
we have to get some exercise.

15
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,879
To balance calorie intake and burn.

16
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:48,960
So it all evens out.

17
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,680
One hour of moderate exercise

18
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,639
burns three to four hundred calories.

19
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,680
It's really good for you.

20
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:57,840
Hui

21
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:59,039
What's wrong?

22
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,280
Are you feeling unwell?

23
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,639
I think work's been too tiring lately.

24
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:04,560
I walk around the office all day.

25
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,479
Feels like I've burned all my calories.

26
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,080
Have I lost weight recently?

27
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,919
Then maybe you should rest.

28
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,240
Yeah, I'll rest too.

29
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,000
Why?

30
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:18,560
I burn calories even when I sleep.

31
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,319
Sleeping counts as exercise too.

32
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:21,040
Exactly.

33
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,240
I use my brain a lot when I dream.

34
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,319
Why don't you say

35
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:26,199
when you eat,

36
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,519
you're burning calories too?

37
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,199
Why don't you say

38
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:29,079
when you sleepwalk,

39
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,399
that's exercise too?

40
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,560
Come on.

41
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,000
Do ten more and you can rest.

42
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,720
No,

43
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,639
The reason you're working out

44
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,360
is it because of Du Peng?

45
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,759
Want to beat him up?

46
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,279
Hui, how about this:

47
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,279
Why not hire Du Peng at your company

48
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,680
and give him a hard time?

49
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,519
Don't mess around.

50
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:54,519
No, Nian'er,

51
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:55,439
let me tell you,

52
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,279
if you really

53
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:59,120
want to get back at Du Peng,

54
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:00,519
I've got plenty of ways.

55
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,639
Just tell me.

56
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:03,079
Okay, ten.

57
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:07,000
One.

58
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:10,639
Two.

59
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,399
Three.

60
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,040
Four.

61
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:24,079
Teacher Liang,

62
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:24,920
I'm leaving work now.

63
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,600
Maybe it's time to give it back to him.

64
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,959
Here you go.

65
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,839
It's lunchtime now.

66
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,800
I got you an extra portion.

67
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:34,399
Now that you mention it,

68
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,199
do you know who I am?

69
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,040
You're Liang Nian'er's good friend.

70
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,519
You're pretty well-informed.

71
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,079
That's because

72
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,600
Because of what?

73
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,720
It's nothing.

74
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:57,680
Because you secretly met Nian'er

75
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,839
and know I'm the one

76
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:00,160
who lives with her.

77
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,199
You could say that.

78
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,480
Since you know

79
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,800
I'm her close friend,

80
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,160
I appreciate your kindness.

81
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,800
You...

82
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,519
What?

83
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:16,879
Are you mad?

84
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,759
Say something.

85
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,600
Cat got your tongue?

86
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,480
You really don't have to do this.

87
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,399
I came here four months ago.

88
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,639
I've been wanting to find Nian'er.

89
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:34,879
But when I saw

90
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,560
her with you all,

91
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,680
she looked happy and content.

92
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,480
I felt I shouldn't disturb her.

93
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,160
So I...

94
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,399
Don't you think you have a responsibility

95
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:49,399
to make up for all the hurt you've caused her?

96
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:50,680
I know I was wrong.

97
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,439
I want to see her too.

98
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,639
But I'm afraid.

99
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,439
Do you still love Nian'er?

100
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,040
I...

101
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,879
Now, it's more about...

102
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,240
I came to tell you today

103
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,959
I think she hasn't let you go yet.

104
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:32,320
But...

105
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,840
As a man,

106
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,080
you should talk to her and make things clear.

107
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,639
Don't hold her back anymore.

108
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:46,360
Such a coward.

109
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:57,799
In this world,

110
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:00,720
men who hurt Nian'er deserve to starve.

111
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:13,240
You really are a coward.

112
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,840
You really said that about him?

113
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,879
Not a single word off.

114
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:16,679
Well said.

115
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,440
If it were me,

116
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,679
I'd say the same.

117
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,000
I think Nian'er

118
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,600
wants to say that to him too.

119
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,039
But she can't bring herself to say it.

120
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:24,000
Then I'll say it for her.

121
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:26,120
About you going to see Du Peng,

122
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,600
don't tell Nian'er, okay?

123
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,080
Don't be fooled by how Nian'er

124
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,039
seems so carefree.

125
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,080
She actually doesn't like

126
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,519
others meddling in her love life.

127
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,000
She can handle it herself.

128
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:37,320
True.

129
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:40,440
Isn't that Zhen Gui?

130
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,000
Director Li.

131
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,360
Li Yihan.

132
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,879
From now on,

133
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:45,879
please call me Director Li.

134
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,200
Zhen Gui,

135
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,279
next time you come,

136
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,039
let me know in advance.

137
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:53,000
I'll treat you to a meal.

138
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,320
By the way, Zhang Hui,

139
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,440
the research report is due, right?

140
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:04,000
I'll give you five more minutes.

141
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,399
Okay.

142
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:12,720
How did I end up taking orders from you?

143
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:15,799
He convinced over ten veteran staff to quit.

144
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,000
After joining the new company,

145
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,200
the new boss fired all the old staff.

146
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:21,440
That's just too tragic.

147
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,039
Is there some kind of scheme here?

148
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,240
Li Yihan returned to the company seamlessly.

149
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,000
He made a big show of loyalty.

150
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,720
Our sales department happened to need people.

151
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:32,639
He was promoted straight to sales director.

152
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:34,200
Two ranks above me.

153
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:37,879
A real master of office politics.

154
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,159
Are you saying there's a feast tonight?

155
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,440
Yes, there is.

156
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,639
Did I forget some special occasion?

157
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,240
We have guests today.

158
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,399
I'll get the door.

159
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,279
Be polite.

160
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,399
Hello.

161
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,879
Hello.

162
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:45,480
Didn't expect Nian'er to invite

163
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,240
him today.

164
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:54,519
Have some water.

165
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:55,200
Thank you.

166
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,240
Did Nian'er invite you here?

167
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,000
No, no, no.

168
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,120
My friend lives nearby.

169
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,120
I just happened to pass by.

170
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:08,799
So I dropped in to visit Teacher Liang.

171
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,639
We all know about you two.

172
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,240
So let's get straight to the point.

173
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,840
Why do you like our Nian'er?

174
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,120
I don't really know.

175
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,440
I just do.

176
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,679
I want a real answer.

177
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,039
I like watching her cook.

178
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:49,679
When she's cooking,

179
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
she's totally focused.

180
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,159
It's beautiful.

181
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,919
Our Nian'er truly is a kitchen goddess.

182
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:05,879
So, no wonder.

183
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,000
Zhengui.

184
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:09,639
Did you take a carrot?

185
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,440
Teacher Liang.

186
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,679
Why are you here?

187
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,039
I just happened to pass by today.

188
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:16,039
So I stopped in to visit.

189
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,200
These two are still pretending.

190
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,200
Clearly, Nian'er invited a man for dinner.

191
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,600
Stay and have dinner with us later.

192
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,759
Okay.

193
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,279
Have a seat.

194
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:51,960
Wait, that's not right.

195
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,799
It's your first time at our place.

196
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:58,759
So how have you seen her cook before?

197
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,559
Last year, at a team-building camp.

198
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:01,799
Nian'er showed off her cooking skills.

199
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:03,720
Since then, I...

200
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,440
So that's it.

201
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:16,559
There's someone else?

202
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:17,600
They're here.

203
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,399
Hello.

204
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,320
Nian'er, Du Peng is here.

205
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:33,120
Stay calm.

206
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:36,679
Liang Nian'er, don't forget

207
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:39,279
why you invited him to this dinner.

208
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:40,840
There's nothing

209
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,759
a dinner can't fix.

210
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,480
Did Nian'er invite Du Peng today

211
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,879
and not Yin Zhanqi?

212
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:43,159
This is so awkward.

213
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:43,960
What should we do?

214
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,000
It's fine, let me handle it.

215
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,399
Let me introduce everyone.

216
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,960
This is Yin Zhanqi.

217
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,039
Nian'er's suitor.

218
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,440
This is Du Peng.

219
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,320
Her ex.

220
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,400
Hello.

221
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:15,400
Hello.

222
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:16,640
Hello, hello.

223
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,519
Mission accomplished.

224
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:03,880
The dishes are ready.

225
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:22,400
Let me introduce everyone.

226
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:23,599
This is

227
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:24,400
Yin Zhanqi.

228
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:25,880
A colleague.

229
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:28,599
And this is

230
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:29,640
Du Peng.

231
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:30,880
My friend.

232
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,200
Already introduced.

233
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,440
Tonight we're having

234
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:54,119
Braised Lamb Chop Hot Pot.

235
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,640
Such a delicious dish.

236
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,240
Some guests even brought gifts.

237
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:04,640
Some came empty-handed.

238
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,039
I told him not to bring anything.

239
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,640
So he's just here for a free meal.

240
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,200
What would you like to drink?

241
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,240
Water is fine for me.

242
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,000
Thank you.

243
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:22,599
Have some juice.

244
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,559
I'll pour for everyone.

245
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,039
Is orange juice okay?

246
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,920
Sure.

247
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:40,319
Thank you.

248
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:43,119
Here.

249
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:06,519
Welcome, both of you.

250
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,000
Welcome.

251
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,839
Thank you.

252
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:09,559
Thank you.

253
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:14,839
Everyone, eat the lamb chops while they're hot.

254
00:22:58,279 --> 00:23:00,119
Is work going well for you lately?

255
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,119
It's been going pretty well.

256
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,119
It's been ages since I had such a feast.

257
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:13,359
This is my first time eating

258
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,119
lamb chops made by Nian'er.

259
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:16,640
It's delicious.

260
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,519
Thank you.

261
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:21,880
You're welcome.

262
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,759
First time.

263
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:25,920
Will it also be the last?

264
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:26,960
Eat more.

265
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,480
I have to work overtime tonight.

266
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,400
Then I won't bother you.

267
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:51,319
I'll walk you out.

268
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,880
Let's just say goodbye here.

269
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,599
You still have guests at home.

270
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,680
This is the laptop

271
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,200
you left here before.

272
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:15,559
It should still work.

273
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,319
So, can I sometimes

274
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:30,640
come over for dinner at your place?

275
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,680
I don't think so.

276
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:46,319
Du Peng.

277
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:04,640
Thank you for showing up again.

278
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:07,880
It gave me a chance

279
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,720
to give myself closure.

280
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:14,400
Let's end it here.

281
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:17,720
Let's stop here.

282
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,720
I've thought it through these past days.

283
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,880
When we first got together,

284
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,759
you said

285
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,079
no matter what problems we face,

286
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:31,240
even if it's hard, we shouldn't break up.

287
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:38,400
But now I want to tell you

288
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:41,319
if we break up,

289
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,200
we shouldn't get back together.

290
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:49,920
Let's be strangers from now on.

291
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,240
Otherwise,

292
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,960
both you and I will lose badly.

293
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,720
I'm no longer afraid of losing.

294
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:19,920
Okay.

295
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:22,559
Thank you.

296
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:29,839
Good luck.

297
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,319
Bye.

298
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,240
Why aren't you keeping the guest company?

299
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:23,839
He said he needs to wash the dishes.

300
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:25,640
I'm not that close with him,

301
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,480
so it's fine.

302
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,880
There's a secret about Nian'er hidden here.

303
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,960
Nian'er has been saving money.

304
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,000
Isn't it all for her late grandmother?

305
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:47,240
But there's another secret.

306
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:50,839
Nian'er grew up with her grandmother.

307
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:52,920
Her father passed away early.

308
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,839
Her mother remarried soon after.

309
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,599
The person closest to Nian'er

310
00:27:56,599 --> 00:27:57,799
was her grandmother.

311
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,319
Her grandfather was an Altay aid official.

312
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:03,319
He died in the line of duty there years ago.

313
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:05,079
So before her grandmother passed away,

314
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:06,519
she wished for her ashes

315
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:07,559
to be sent to Xinjiang,

316
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:09,119
to be buried with her husband.

317
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:14,559
And to plant a tree there.

318
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,759
To remain forever in Altay's soil.

319
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,240
But moving a grave

320
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,319
is not an easy thing to do.

321
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,960
Nian'er insists on fulfilling her grandma's wish.

322
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,720
But her aunt spoke up.

323
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:29,119
She said moving the grave is fine,

324
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,799
but the money for the plot

325
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:32,119
and the funeral expenses

326
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:33,319
must all be paid back to them.

327
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:34,039
How much?

328
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,880
A lot.

329
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,920
No wonder she's been saving so hard.

330
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,079
Thank you.

331
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:05,599
It's nothing.
