00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,639
Hello everyone

2
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,080
Welcome friends from Century Real Estate

3
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,960
I'm today's instructor Zhang Hui

4
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,479
Nice to meet you all

5
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,400
The purpose of today's class

6
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,759
is to help everyone

7
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,680
through the project management module

8
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,759
better achieve your sales targets

9
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,599
Teacher Zhang

10
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,719
We're all real estate agents

11
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,879
We don't deal with project management

12
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,960
Let's not waste time, okay?

13
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,400
Get to the point

14
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,000
I think this student

15
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,039
raised a very good question

16
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,240
Yes, we're in real estate sales

17
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,039
Why should we learn project management?

18
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,840
I'm curious too

19
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,639
Why did you ask this question?

20
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:09,400
So I'd like to ask you

21
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,759
How do you view your work?

22
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:14,000
How do you understand project management?

23
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,599
Our job

24
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:17,800
is to sell houses quickly and efficiently

25
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,360
As for project management

26
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,599
Let me answer that for you

27
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,199
Project management

28
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:27,039
isn't just simple process management

29
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:30,240
It involves project planning, execution

30
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,560
monitoring, and closing

31
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,520
In real estate sales

32
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,599
we need to use

33
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,479
project management concepts and methods

34
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:40,159
to plan our sales process

35
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,360
Let's look at the PPT

36
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,039
Hello? Yes, go ahead

37
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,000
Okay, got it

38
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,160
Thank you all for your cooperation

39
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,839
If what you learned today

40
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,240
was helpful to you

41
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,120
please fill out

42
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,399
a positive feedback form

43
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,120
Thank you

44
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:29,000
If you're satisfied

45
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,279
with today's class

46
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:32,240
please check this box, yes

47
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,959
Thank you all, thank you

48
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,879
Do you think the supervisor is targeting us?

49
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,920
Teaching project management to salespeople

50
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,160
Do they even need it?

51
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,680
And calling them potential users

52
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,879
Most importantly

53
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:56,879
He knows your specialty is business consulting

54
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,879
This is like making a blacksmith do carpentry

55
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,800
If we lose this deal

56
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,399
it'll be a disaster

57
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,639
Yihan, thank you so much today

58
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,839
You, a team leader, came as my assistant

59
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:09,639
I'll treat you to dinner soon

60
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:10,519
No problem, no problem

61
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,879
You spoke really well today

62
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:14,360
You shut him up with just a few words

63
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,399
I see your schedule

64
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:19,759
is packed with classes

65
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:21,639
Probably no time for meals

66
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:22,639
Not really

67
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,079
Be careful of low blood sugar

68
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:28,360
My cousin brought this chocolate from abroad

69
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,879
For your low blood sugar, keep it

70
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,079
Well...

71
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,600
Teacher Zhang, I didn't know

72
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,879
if you eat chocolate

73
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,920
I'll be more careful

74
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,319
No, it's not that

75
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,639
Oh, and also

76
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,560
I answered a call for you outside

77
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,879
That guy said he can't pretend to be your boyfriend

78
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:55,639
He'll return the 5000 yuan soon

79
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:01,319
No, it's like this, like this

80
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:04,160
You go ahead, I'll... I'll go work

81
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,920
Well...

82
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:09,480
Call me anytime you need

83
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,560
I'll be here

84
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,519
Yihan, are you free tonight?

85
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:19,439
How about dinner at my place tonight?

86
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,439
Sure

87
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,360
Now let's play a truth-telling game

88
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:39,560
where you must answer within three seconds

89
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,480
One rule: no lying

90
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:47,480
How did your love story with Hui begin?

91
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,959
(empty line for timing)

92
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:53,439
It was a stormy night with thunder and lightning

93
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:58,279
When Hui looked at me with her gentle,

94
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:00,680
clear and bright eyes like water

95
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,759
I knew we were meant to be together

96
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:05,920
Because I was instantly struck by her charm

97
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,920
Be serious

98
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,920
How long have you actually been dating?

99
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,240
About half a year

100
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,319
To be precise, six months and eight days

101
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:20,680
Because I remember every single day

102
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,439
I've been with Hui

103
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:22,920
Yes yes, including today

104
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,079
Exactly eight days

105
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,079
Brother Yihan, you're so attentive

106
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:28,879
That's only natural

107
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:29,680
That's what love is

108
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:31,639
Where was your first date?

109
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:33,240
It was at...

110
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,519
a very impressive...

111
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,720
very very... elegant

112
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,720
and romantic café

113
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:41,000
Their coffee...

114
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,399
and French pastries

115
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,199
were absolutely delicious

116
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,519
And the ambiance was great

117
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,000
As Hui's boyfriend,

118
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,040
what would you like to say to her?

119
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:00,000
Actually sometimes

120
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,639
I don't feel like her boyfriend

121
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,800
Because she's so strong, independent and confident

122
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,079
She doesn't seem to need anyone to rely on

123
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:11,800
And me...

124
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,319
I'm more like her personal comedian

125
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,600
When she's unhappy

126
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,600
or bored

127
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,240
I use my humor to cheer her up

128
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,480
Right

129
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,879
What would you give up for Hui?

130
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,920
I'd give up everything for Hui

131
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:34,320
Because she's the most

132
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,960
important person in my heart

133
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:43,399
Hui

134
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,159
Zhenhui

135
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,039
Let's have a quick meeting

136
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,399
Have a seat first

137
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,240
Okay

138
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:50,960
Just sit for a while

139
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:06,879
What do you two think?

140
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,399
No problem, he lies without blinking

141
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,399
His acting is decent

142
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,960
Why did you choose him as fake boyfriend?

143
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:18,840
Not because he's particularly clever

144
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,519
But because the fake boyfriend I hired

145
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,799
bailed on me last minute

146
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,480
And Li Yihan was happy to help me out

147
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,399
Isn't it because he's decent-looking?

148
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:32,399
Do I seem that shallow to you?

149
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,799
If you both think it's fine

150
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:37,600
then I'm relieved about my mom

151
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,480
As you know

152
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:41,960
my mom is a teacher

153
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,720
She's very strict about everything

154
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,679
and quick to make big issues out of things

155
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,279
I'm afraid she'll notice something's off

156
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:55,600
Understood

157
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:57,759
Let me practice with you

158
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:07,480
Pretty convincing

159
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:09,559
I can't stand you guys

160
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:10,679
I'll go grocery shopping

161
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:11,799
What does auntie like to eat?

162
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:12,600
Pasta

163
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,360
For auntie, not you

164
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,639
Anything's fine

165
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,279
Okay

166
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,240
Auntie

167
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:32,879
Coming

168
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,039
Let's see what to buy today

169
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:35,840
These shrimp look good

170
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,879
Are these sea shrimp 24 per pound?

171
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:38,519
Yes

172
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:39,279
One pound

173
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:40,519
Yes, one pound

174
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:41,480
These are good

175
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,240
See, I've only got this much left

176
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,000
Give me one pound

177
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,759
Okay

178
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,120
No no, make it two pounds

179
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,159
Okay

180
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:56,320
Double eight

181
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,279
I'm back

182
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,559
Is it pasta?

183
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:02,440
Yes

184
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,080
How long until auntie arrives?

185
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,120
About fifteen minutes

186
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:08,720
Let me help you

187
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,399
You go play with them

188
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,919
Come on, whose turn is it?

189
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:17,279
Here, bomb

190
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:40,120
Zhengui, can I borrow your white wine?

191
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,759
Okay, but I've been saving it

192
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:43,600
No time

193
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,200
Cooking sometimes requires a sense of ceremony

194
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:57,480
Like pasta

195
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,279
Without this step

196
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,480
The cooked result

197
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,320
Always seems to lack something

198
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:05,159
Cook for exactly twelve minutes

199
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:07,480
To achieve the perfect texture

200
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,480
In Italian it's called

201
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,399
Al dente

202
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,200
That pleasantly chewy texture

203
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:19,840
Sauce is the soul of pasta

204
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:23,240
First sauté bacon in butter

205
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,399
With mushrooms and onions

206
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,000
Then add plenty of fresh milk

207
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,279
And light cream

208
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,279
Some black pepper

209
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:43,600
And salt

210
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,919
Add perfectly cooked pasta

211
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:51,840
Coat every strand with thick sauce

212
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,279
Simmer on low heat

213
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,279
Don't forget parsley garnish

214
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,919
Pasta pairs perfectly with pumpkin cream soup

215
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,639
While steaming pumpkin

216
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:35,200
Let's make a Tuna Vegetable Salad

217
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,120
The salad's tanginess

218
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,559
Balances the cream's richness

219
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,440
Steamed pumpkin

220
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,440
Blend into smooth puree

221
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,039
Onion

222
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:12,240
Mushrooms

223
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:13,480
Sauté until fragrant

224
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:16,000
Add water and simmer

225
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:23,679
Salt

226
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:28,159
Sugar

227
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,559
Add some of each

228
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:40,519
Serve in white porcelain

229
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,960
Most beautiful

230
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,480
Drizzle with light cream

231
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,120
Perfect

232
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,720
Mom, auntie

233
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:18,000
Long time no see

234
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,000
You brought gifts for me?

235
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,320
Don't flatter yourself

236
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,360
Not for you

237
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,799
For your friends

238
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,840
Little Zhengui

239
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,080
You've grown so tall!

240
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,000
I'm twenty-four now

241
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,440
Mom, this is Nian'er

242
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,639
The one I always mention

243
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:37,480
Hello auntie

244
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,399
Hello Nian'er

245
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:39,879
Hui often talks about you

246
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,480
Why are you cooking?

247
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,159
I wanted to treat you out

248
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:46,039
This is too much trouble

249
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:47,000
No trouble at all, auntie

250
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,480
I love cooking for everyone

251
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:50,159
Please sit, I'll keep cooking

252
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:50,840
Okay

253
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,639
Come sit inside

254
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:54,679
Hello auntie

255
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,279
Hello

256
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:03,840
For steak, first add black pepper

257
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,159
And sea salt

258
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,919
Marinate

259
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:18,960
Give it a massage to absorb flavors

260
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,919
Heat oil in pan

261
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,600
Sear each side for 45 seconds

262
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,200
Precise heat and timing control

263
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,679
Is key to perfect steak

264
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:48,360
Add some butter

265
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,000
Elevates the steak

266
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,639
Floral with pine notes

267
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,600
Rosemary flavor

268
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,400
Slice against grain for tenderness

269
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,640
Auntie, this drink is for you

270
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,039
Welcome to our home

271
00:17:58,319 --> 00:17:59,480
Thank you, little Zhengui

272
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:01,319
Dinner is served

273
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:09,400
Nian'er cooked all these dishes

274
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,119
I've never had any of these

275
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:14,440
Thank you Nian'er

276
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,640
My pleasure, auntie

277
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:17,279
Perfect color, aroma and taste

278
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,640
Let's eat everyone

279
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,640
Before the food gets cold

280
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,240
Welcome back to our home, Auntie.

281
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,119
Welcome.

282
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,519
Thank you, thank you.

283
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:39,160
Auntie.

284
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:43,599
This is the Creamy Shrimp Pasta.

285
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:46,640
And this steak.

286
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,200
If medium-rare isn't to your taste,

287
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,279
we've specially prepared medium-well for you.

288
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,319
Thank you, Nian'er. So thoughtful.

289
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,240
Let's eat.

290
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,240
Delicious.

291
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:50,640
Really delicious.

292
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:21,599
So, Xiao Li...

293
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,119
How long have you been with our Hui?

294
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,240
Auntie, Hui'er and I have known each other for half a year.

295
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,920
To be precise, six months and eight days.

296
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,319
Oh my, you remember so clearly.

297
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,440
How did you meet?

298
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,680
At a seminar... in the park.

299
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:49,440
Shouldn't you think this through?

300
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,759
Or discuss it properly?

301
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:54,000
Was it the park or the seminar?

302
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,519
Mom, I...

303
00:21:57,519 --> 00:21:59,000
Auntie, here's what happened...

304
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:03,559
The three of us were strolling in the park,

305
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:06,440
when Brother Yihan...

306
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,640
was walking his dog.

307
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:11,319
His dog misbehaved...

308
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:12,799
It came over to us...

309
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,960
and peed near us.

310
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,759
He kept apologizing profusely,

311
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:19,400
and after apologizing...

312
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:21,119
Later we met again...

313
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:22,000
And then...

314
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Later on...

315
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,240
at a business management seminar.

316
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,240
It was our second meeting.

317
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,240
She was on stage then,

318
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,440
giving an excellent presentation.

319
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,160
I was deeply attracted by her unique charm.

320
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,079
I think Hui'er...

321
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:36,839
is a cultured, well-raised girl.

322
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:39,839
I see.

323
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,039
Auntie, I see you enjoy the shrimp.

324
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:46,759
Here, have some more.

325
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,839
Nian'er, this dish is so delicious.

326
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:50,119
I must eat more.

327
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:56,240
Xiao Li, what do you do?

328
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,160
Auntie, we work at the same company,

329
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,200
just in different positions.

330
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,440
I'm in sales.

331
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,880
What are your career plans

332
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,039
for the future?

333
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:07,240
Well...

334
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,559
I plan to...

335
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,119
First develop ourselves at the current company,

336
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,160
learn and improve our skills,

337
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,400
and expand our network.

338
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,279
When we've improved enough

339
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:18,279
and gained enough experience,

340
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:19,880
we'll start our own studio.

341
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:22,160
Your parents...

342
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,240
Mom, that's enough.

343
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,880
Let me toast Auntie.

344
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:33,720
When I was little, my parents were often away.

345
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,039
You took care of me.

346
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,319
I'm so grateful to you.

347
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,480
I was so lonely at home,

348
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,440
and often came to your place for meals.

349
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,240
Seeing your happy family

350
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,640
always made me feel warm.

351
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,920
I felt so happy.

352
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:47,799
I've always envied Hui'er

353
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:49,480
because you cook so well too.

354
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,680
Thank you.

355
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:01,680
See you next time.

356
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:04,799
Thank you, little Zhen'gui.

357
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,119
Nian'er, thank you for tonight.

358
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:08,200
Not at all, Auntie.

359
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:09,880
Mom, let's go.

360
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:11,200
I'll see you out.

361
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,759
Auntie, take care on your way.

362
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:13,920
Alright, goodbye.

363
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,279
A mother's love is truly great.

364
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,400
Why are you suddenly so emotional?

365
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:27,400
I remember when we were kids,

366
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,200
Hui told me

367
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,519
her mom didn't like shrimp.

368
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,559
But just now,

369
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:36,640
I remember she actually did like them.

370
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,599
She just knew Hui loved them,

371
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:42,720
so she pretended not to like them.

372
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:48,799
I don't think she should lie to her mom.

373
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:50,799
She should find a proper boyfriend.

374
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,119
Lying to Hui's mom was wrong,

375
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:56,640
but finding someone just to avoid lying

376
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,039
isn't the right solution either.

377
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:02,240
Whatever.

378
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,640
Just don't get involved with that Li Yihan.

379
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,400
That's all that matters.

380
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,200
Why?

381
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,640
That Brother Yihan,

382
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,839
I think a considerate man like you

383
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:20,000
is really rare in this world.

384
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:23,400
Shall we exchange contacts

385
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,640
and keep in touch?

386
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,000
Why?

387
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,440
Your dad's finally retiring for good this time.

388
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:45,240
After working as a rehire for so many years,

389
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,000
it's time he took care of his health.

390
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:49,880
You'll have to watch his drinking then.

391
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:51,640
If you were home,

392
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,319
he wouldn't touch a drop.

393
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:54,640
If I say one word,

394
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,799
he has ten thousand comebacks ready.

395
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:57,039
I won't provoke him.

396
00:25:58,119 --> 00:26:01,200
Mom, my career's going really well now.

397
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,440
That apartment Uncle saw before,

398
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,880
the smaller unit next door looks perfect.

399
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,599
Let me save up some more,

400
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,799
then I can buy it outright.

401
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,279
Is the bathroom still leaking at home?

402
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:15,200
And Uncle told me

403
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,279
there's always a gas smell in the kitchen.

404
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:19,119
You should get that checked.

405
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,440
Save your money for yourself.

406
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:23,200
Don't always worry about us.

407
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,680
Also,

408
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:29,200
you've been avoiding your dad's calls.

409
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,640
Is it because he keeps nagging about marriage?

410
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,920
Driving you crazy with it?

411
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,519
I've told him so many times,

412
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:37,880
but he won't listen to me.

413
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,720
Now it's all he ever talks about.

414
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,880
Mom, does Dad think

415
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:51,400
I'm a failure for not being married?

416
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,599
That's not what he means.

417
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,920
He just wants you to find true happiness.

418
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:07,079
Hui,

419
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,720
that Li Yihan earlier,

420
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:14,240
he's not really your boyfriend, right?

421
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:19,519
It's delicious.

422
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:26,839
If you'd really been dating six months,

423
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,640
how could he not know?

424
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,200
Mom, I'm sorry.

425
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,880
About breaking up with Runze...

426
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,400
I already knew.

427
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:45,200
But don't worry,

428
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,640
your father doesn't know.

429
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,440
How did you find out?

430
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,039
Your uncle told me.

431
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:57,240
You blocked us from that post,

432
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,279
but forgot to block your uncle.

433
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:01,880
You forgot to exclude him.

434
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,079
Don't be upset.

435
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:07,920
Don't worry about your dad.

436
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:10,119
If he nags you about it,

437
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:12,240
I have ways to handle him.

438
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,039
Hui, can I ask you something?

439
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,680
You were with Runze so long.

440
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:27,759
Why break up suddenly?

441
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,799
I thought he truly loved me,

442
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:33,599
but when we discussed

443
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:35,440
engagement, I realized

444
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,519
he wouldn't give up

445
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:39,319
the whole forest for one tree.

446
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:42,440
Maybe I'm not good enough,

447
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,920
or he has other options.

448
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:51,440
Mom, have I failed

449
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,480
your expectations again?

450
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,400
Hui, remember this:

451
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:01,119
Having a boyfriend or getting married

452
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:03,079
isn't what we expect from you.

453
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,519
I've spent my whole life

454
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:09,200
living up to others' expectations.

455
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:12,039
So my daughter

456
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,880
should live her own way -

457
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:19,680
safe, healthy, and truly happy.
