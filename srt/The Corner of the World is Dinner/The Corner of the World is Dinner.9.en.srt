1
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:38,840
Right now, the three of you are dancing well.

2
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,479
But it's still missing something.

3
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:43,319
At the moment, Li Zhenggui is the best dancer.

4
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,599
But Li Zhenggui, don't get cocky.

5
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,039
You need to motivate those

6
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,759
who aren't dancing as well.

7
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,280
Unity is strength.

8
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:51,560
Only then can we accomplish

9
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,159
the task assigned by the organization.

10
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:54,879
Gain three thousand followers.

11
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:57,719
So the three of you can

12
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,000
choreograph a dance that's

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,719
practical for everyday life.

14
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,719
Down-to-earth.

15
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,919
Sunny, positive, full of energy.

16
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,639
How did one livestream

17
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:14,680
end up losing twenty?

18
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,319
Let's just treat it as rehearsal.

19
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,040
Working on the weekend?

20
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,600
I just made some hot tea.

21
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,800
Have a cup before you go.

22
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,639
I have an important meeting tomorrow.

23
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:55,040
So,

24
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,680
I need to head to the office to prepare.

25
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,480
I'll skip the tea for now.

26
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,399
It's my turn to take out the trash today.

27
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,000
It's fine.

28
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,800
I'll do it on my way.

29
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,199
Have you noticed

30
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,040
that Hui's been acting a bit

31
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,959
strange lately?

32
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:18,480
I think she's got something on her mind.

33
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,600
I asked her about it.

34
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,279
But she didn't say a word.

35
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:31,720
Where are you going?

36
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,879
To practice dancing.

37
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,279
Are you dancing in the bathroom?

38
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,079
Bathroom first.

39
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,800
Relief.

40
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,240
This is the training system

41
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,639
we designed for BG Company.

42
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:50,800
Director Ma,

43
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,439
I've finished my report.

44
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:52,319
Please give your instructions.

45
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,920
That was impressive.

46
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,920
No wonder you're our company's

47
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,439
senior training consultant.

48
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,519
Very precise positioning.

49
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:59,199
And the needs analysis is thorough.

50
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,439
The setup of this training system

51
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,079
really matches our major client's

52
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:07,240
organizational development needs at BG Company.

53
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:08,519
Thank you, Director Ma.

54
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:09,480
You're too kind.

55
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:10,240
Director Ma,

56
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,240
actually, I've been following

57
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,800
this project all along.

58
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,839
Plus, I have a great relationship

59
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:16,279
with their Director Chen.

60
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:17,959
This project,

61
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:19,680
from initiation to research,

62
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,480
was all organized and arranged by me.

63
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,160
Yihan, share your thoughts

64
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,480
on this proposal.

65
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,160
Okay.

66
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:27,680
First of all,

67
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,680
this project

68
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,360
wasn't it dumped here before he left?

69
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,439
If Zhang Hui hadn't kept following up,

70
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,920
this project would've failed.

71
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,480
He still has the nerve to talk.

72
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,519
But the training volume

73
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:40,040
is a bit conservative.

74
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,800
Zhang Hui,

75
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,920
this can't keep up with BG's growth.

76
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,600
Right?

77
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,360
Director Li,

78
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,519
project implementation takes time.

79
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:49,639
If we go too aggressive at first,

80
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:51,279
and something isn't perfected,

81
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,360
or needs improvement,

82
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,639
and we don't improve it,

83
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:54,560
it'll end up hurting

84
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,879
our reputation and the client's interests.

85
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,120
First,

86
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,480
whether the project is complete

87
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,319
is what you, as a consultant,

88
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:05,120
must address immediately.

89
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,879
But whether the training volume is enough

90
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,439
has nothing to do with being

91
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:11,959
conservative or aggressive.

92
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:12,319
Zhang Hui,

93
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,240
if you're not capable,

94
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,439
just say so anytime.

95
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:15,560
Director Ma,

96
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,160
I worked my way up from the front lines.

97
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,399
So her excuses don't fool me.

98
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,600
This proposal

99
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,720
does fit

100
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,680
BG Company's previous requirements.

101
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:29,639
But recently,

102
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,439
BG headquarters is planning global layoffs.

103
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:33,040
And this round

104
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,439
will soon affect our China branch.

105
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:37,240
Also, the market now

106
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,360
is shifting toward

107
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,920
AI-assisted online methods.

108
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,480
But our proposal is still

109
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:44,199
mainly traditional and offline.

110
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,120
Li Yihan,

111
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:48,680
if you took this proposal

112
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,000
to BG right now,

113
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:52,439
do you think they'd accept it?

114
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:57,120
Yes, that's right, Director Ma.

115
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,240
Your insight into the training market

116
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:01,720
is truly visionary.

117
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,879
It also makes up for

118
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,800
our shortcomings.

119
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,000
That's right.

120
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,199
I just recently

121
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,800
returned after some time away.

122
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,920
I came back in response to the company's call.

123
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,959
I'm back at my post.

124
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:17,319
So the main person in charge

125
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,800
is still Zhang Hui.

126
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,480
She's fully responsible.

127
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,360
Don't worry.

128
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:23,000
I'll follow your instructions

129
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,279
and urge her to improve it quickly.

130
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:34,879
I didn't expect you to do this.

131
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:36,720
I trusted you with such an important client.

132
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,240
And this is how you did the market research?

133
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,159
If it weren't for

134
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,919
Director Ma's sharp insight,

135
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,440
this project would've failed.

136
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,639
If BG is gone,

137
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:47,120
you're out immediately.

138
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:49,879
Alright then.

139
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:51,879
Everyone understands the importance of this proposal.

140
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:52,720
That's enough.

141
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:54,480
Let's wait and see.

142
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,440
That's it for today's meeting.

143
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,159
Meeting adjourned.

144
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,039
Director Ma, take care.

145
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,559
Did you see that?

146
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:30,600
You need to have this.

147
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,840
You have to lift it up.

148
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,919
Your face needs to be raised.

149
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,279
This is the crown shape.

150
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:37,679
Palm.

151
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,840
Look at how they're dancing.

152
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,679
Did you see that?

153
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,519
Yu Dama is really dancing well.

154
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,960
You were probably like me
when you were young.

155
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,440
A talented and beautiful woman.

156
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,879
Director Ma

157
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,879
Let me show you.

158
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:00,240
This is my revised proposal.

159
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,279
Briefly explain what you changed.

160
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:08,720
Director Ma

161
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:11,279
The AI online training you mentioned

162
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,000
is definitely a future trend.

163
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,759
But

164
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:15,320
online training is actually for

165
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,519
individual skill development.

166
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:17,840
But for BG Company,

167
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,519
the system we designed

168
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,399
is aimed at future managers.

169
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,440
Those future managers

170
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,440
need more focus on

171
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,679
interpersonal skills and influence.

172
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:26,279
So

173
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:27,080
the online model

174
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,799
may not help them much.

175
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:31,080
They still need offline training.

176
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,120
Director Ma

177
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,440
I found some recent research papers

178
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:40,480
and attached them at the end.

179
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,000
These can support

180
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,320
my previous proposal.

181
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,879
Isn't this our company's solution?

182
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:06,240
Why does the other company
have the exact same thing?

183
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,240
This company—

184
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:15,879
Is it the one Li Yihan

185
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:17,320
switched to before?

186
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,000
Director Ma

187
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:18,960
Ma.

188
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,879
Zhang Hui

189
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,000
If you have any issues,

190
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,120
report to me immediately,

191
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,440
not bypassing the chain of command.

192
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:30,360
Director Ma

193
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,080
About this matter—

194
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:33,679
Zhang Hui

195
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,519
Why do you think their company

196
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:38,879
has our business secrets?

197
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:41,320
Secrets?

198
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,120
What secrets?

199
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,000
What's going on?

200
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,440
This—this can't be, this—

201
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,799
This...

202
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,600
Director Ma

203
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,440
I understand now.

204
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,799
It must be

205
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:57,080
those who joined the competitor

206
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,120
who did this.

207
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,120
They were upset about being fired

208
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,120
so they took our secrets

209
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,480
to trade for their future.

210
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:04,639
Those people are really—

211
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:05,399
Li Yihan

212
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:07,000
How can you be so sure

213
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,840
it was those former employees?

214
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:10,360
Director Ma

215
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,039
Here's the situation.

216
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:12,519
I just got the news myself.

217
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:14,679
So I rushed over to report to you.

218
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,000
Zhang Hui

219
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,799
You didn't do this, did you?

220
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:25,799
You're upset I got promoted
and you didn't.

221
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:27,559
And you resented me rejecting your plan.

222
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:29,240
So you took revenge on me
and the company.

223
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,879
Li Yihan, don't make baseless accusations.

224
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:32,960
Director Ma

225
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,440
Give me a few minutes.

226
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,360
I can find out

227
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,120
which account downloaded

228
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,799
these files.

229
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:48,720
To prevent leaks,

230
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,039
our R&D team

231
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:51,799
specifically asked IT

232
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:53,440
to set up a system.

233
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,799
Once a file is downloaded,

234
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:56,120
it leaves a digital trail.

235
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:02,879
And for these files,

236
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:04,639
all the download accounts are

237
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,159
Li Yihan.

238
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,879
You convinced twelve senior staff
to quit together,

239
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:20,639
waiting for a chance to rise.

240
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,039
And you smeared me and the old staff.

241
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,000
I couldn't figure out

242
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
why the other company
would help you

243
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,639
set up such a big trap.

244
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,840
Ruining all the old staff's futures,

245
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,759
while you returned to the company
unscathed,

246
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:33,720
and got promoted and a raise.

247
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,039
Now I understand.

248
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:38,600
Zhang Hui

249
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,360
Don't think you can frame me
with fake evidence.

250
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,879
and accuse me falsely.

251
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,879
You think—

252
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:44,960
Director Ma

253
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,879
Director Ma, let me explain.

254
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:19,720
Just dance like this.

255
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:20,600
Yes, yes, yes.

256
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,480
Your hand must be like this.

257
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,000
Yes, yes.

258
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,240
Stick your butt out.

259
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,919
Li Zhenggui

260
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,440
That's how it should be.

261
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,320
In life,

262
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,480
you must try new things.

263
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,600
Great dancing.

264
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,879
I can see you have real potential.

265
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:37,519
Keep working hard, keep it up.

266
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:39,000
Your hand should be like that.

267
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,919
My back can't take it anymore.

268
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,720
Everyone,

269
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,879
thanks for watching.

270
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,080
Bye-bye.

271
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,399
See you next time.

272
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:51,240
How many new followers?

273
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,240
Two hours.

274
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:54,919
Twenty followers.

275
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,960
When you were dancing just now,

276
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,440
there were thirty old men watching.

277
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,519
I only got twenty in two hours.

278
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:04,080
Do you know why?

279
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,519
Because those thirty old men

280
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:08,000
are all bachelors.

281
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,039
My body can't keep up anymore.

282
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,240
My back can't compare to you young folks.

283
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,240
Keep working hard.

284
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:18,039
I'm your fan now.

285
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:19,440
Keep it up!

286
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:22,519
My neck isn't good.

287
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:23,639
And my back, I—

288
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:28,720
Me too.

289
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,080
Two hours.

290
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:31,320
Twenty followers.

291
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,200
That's a bit slow.

292
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,480
Yes, yes, yes.

293
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,279
No, that's not enough.

294
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,919
I need to come up with something clever.

295
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,679
Help me! Come back quickly!

296
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:54,480
Come home and save me!

297
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,320
Hui

298
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,159
Are you free after work?

299
00:15:59,159 --> 00:15:59,960
Let's get together.

300
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,519
Not today.

301
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:01,279
I have things to do at home.

302
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,039
I'm heading home now.

303
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:02,360
Next time.

304
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,080
Bye.

305
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,440
Don't make it too heavy.

306
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,639
That would be too flashy.

307
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:07,759
For her look,

308
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,960
Don't make the outfit like

309
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,000
the White Lady's hairstyle.

310
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,720
Zhenggui

311
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:14,399
It's fine.

312
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,799
If it's fine, why call us to help?

313
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,720
If you don't come back soon,

314
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,840
she's going to drive me crazy.

315
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,279
How do you want us to help?

316
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:40,039
Travel through time with me.

317
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,680
Hello, everyone.

318
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,440
Welcome to my livestream.

319
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,240
This is our Jiangzhou ancient town.

320
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:26,680
Xuanxi

321
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,400
It's built on a river,

322
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,880
so it's named after the river.

323
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,960
Up to now,

324
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,519
it has seven hundred fifty years of history.

325
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:38,839
These three are our invited guests.

326
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:40,480
Come on, say hi to everyone.

327
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,799
First time on camera,

328
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,400
feels like being a star.

329
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,519
Of course!

330
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:50,640
Just look at

331
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:52,240
who picked the outfits.

332
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:57,519
Relax a bit.

333
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:00,240
Pretend we're just traveling.

334
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,680
Traveling.

335
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,400
Coming to the ancient town,

336
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,400
there's a special title.

337
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,880
It's called Beautiful China.

338
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,799
Here, there are not only

339
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:12,000
trendy, bold old town streets,

340
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,119
but also fun, modern shops.

341
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:19,119
And unique East-West fusion buildings.

342
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:20,920
Plus a food street for eating and drinking.

343
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:23,599
In this dreamy, lit-up Jiangnan,

344
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:25,079
you can experience

345
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,880
the romance of traveling through time.

346
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,880
That's all for today's stream.

347
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:50,720
Thank you for watching.

348
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,359
See you next time.

349
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:54,079
Bye.

350
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:56,559
How many new followers?

351
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:58,079
Three.

352
00:18:58,519 --> 00:18:59,759
Only three?

353
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,480
Just three short.

354
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,759
The video account reached two thousand.

355
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,079
Still a bit away from three thousand,

356
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,000
just a little short.

357
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,559
Let's call today's promo a success.

358
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,119
We did it!

359
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:16,680
It was worth it.

360
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,839
I'll cook a feast for you tonight.

361
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:25,160
Hui

362
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:26,880
Where do you feel unwell?

363
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,559
Feels a bit seasick.

364
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,319
Was the stream too long today?

365
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:33,359
It's fine, we're almost there.

366
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,960
Hot oil brings out the spices' aroma.

367
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:10,759
Mix everything together.

368
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,160
Cilantro beef salad.

369
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:14,319
Perfect.

370
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,799
Next, let's make Tom Yum soup.

371
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:30,799
In Thai,

372
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,599
Tom Yum means sour and spicy.

373
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,359
Yum means shrimp.

374
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,359
A rich, tasty soup.

375
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:37,400
Fresh and appetizing.

376
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,440
Hui will surely love it.

377
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:29,559
Smells amazing.

378
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,039
Mistake, mistake.

379
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,440
What's wrong?

380
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:43,200
Didn't we just finish

381
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,759
the task Yu Dama gave us?

382
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,759
Yeah.

383
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:47,119
That's why it was a mistake.

384
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,920
When I'm streaming,

385
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:51,519
why is it so hard to gain followers?

386
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:55,119
Why is that?

387
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,559
Because I underestimated my own beauty.

388
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:01,599
I thought I looked great in modern clothes.

389
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:02,400
But I didn't expect

390
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,680
that in ancient costume,

391
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:10,720
my charm is at its peak.

392
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,480
Still,

393
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,279
today is a victorious day.

394
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:19,720
Let's celebrate!

395
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:21,680
To victory!

396
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,680
To victory!

397
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:23,920
To dinner!

398
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:34,160
Hui

399
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,960
This is your favorite lettuce salad.

400
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:37,720
I made it just for you.

401
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,039
Try it.

402
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,759
Specially made?

403
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,119
It's so delicious.

404
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,319
It made me cry.

405
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,279
What's wrong?

406
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,319
I added wasabi in it.

407
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,519
I heard wasabi relieves stress.

408
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,480
Not that much, though.

409
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,240
Hui

410
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,440
It's good to cry out your sadness.

411
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,720
We're always here for you.

412
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:14,319
I'm pregnant.

413
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,160
But we've already broken up.

414
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:40,039
If this world

415
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,279
let men have babies instead,

416
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:45,359
a lot of things would be different.
