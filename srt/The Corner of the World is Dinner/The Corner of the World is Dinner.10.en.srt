1
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,360
This one.

2
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,719
This one.

3
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:37,719
And this one.

4
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:42,639
These ingredients all look expensive.

5
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:43,879
There's abalone, too.

6
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,400
I've been saving these for a long time.

7
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,120
I've wanted to eat them for ages.

8
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,159
Alright.

9
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,240
It's a birthday party.

10
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,360
If the meal costs a bit more,

11
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,159
that's fine.

12
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,159
Exactly.

13
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:55,599
Look, it's our birthday.

14
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,199
A beautiful girl celebrating her birthday.

15
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:57,800
One year older.

16
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,240
Think of it as compensation.

17
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,360
Okay.

18
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,919
But Li Zhenggui,

19
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:04,159
you can only pick three dishes.

20
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,080
Three?

21
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,120
That's... really hard to choose.

22
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:16,280
Take these.

23
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,319
These three.

24
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,120
Don't show me.

25
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,319
Why?

26
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,479
It's a birthday party.

27
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:29,759
Leave some suspense.

28
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:30,879
I want a surprise.

29
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:33,680
Li Zhenggui.

30
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,360
It's Nian'er's birthday.

31
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,120
So it's Nian'er's birthday party.

32
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,599
What's mine is hers.

34
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,560
What's hers is mine.

35
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,560
That's what best friends do.

36
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,439
See you at dinner.

37
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,280
Why don't you pick one too?

38
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:57,560
You're pregnant, is there anything you want?

39
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,719
Nian'er.

40
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:06,280
Cong-ge.

41
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,199
There's a big project tonight.

42
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,319
You have to stay.

43
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,560
You know how it is.

44
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,560
Some celebrities like to be late now.

45
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:12,439
No, Cong-ge,

46
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:13,120
I have something today—

47
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,960
I'm parking now.

48
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,960
I'm downstairs.

49
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,520
Coming, coming.

50
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,120
It's really important.

51
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,560
Here we go again.

52
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,639
Nian'er.

53
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,439
Why aren't you home yet?

54
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,879
Hurry up!

55
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:28,199
We can't wait any longer

56
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:31,360
to celebrate your birthday.

57
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,120
Hui.

58
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,439
She got off work extra early.

59
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,720
Li Zhenggui.

60
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,720
Sorry.

61
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,879
I might have to work late tonight.

62
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,480
You and Hui don't need to wait for me.

63
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,279
How about we postpone until tomorrow?

64
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:49,000
You can't postpone a birthday to tomorrow!

65
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:53,079
I really can't help it.

66
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,839
How about this—

67
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:57,000
You two use the emergency fund

68
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,240
and go eat something nice outside.

69
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,040
Sorry.

70
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,079
Nian'er is so unreliable.

71
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,240
You can't blame Nian'er for this.

72
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,079
That's just how work is.

73
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,360
I stayed up all night

74
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,800
just for tonight's feast.

75
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,800
Stop thinking only about your feast.

76
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,720
Don't forget,

77
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,240
today is Nian'er's birthday.

78
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,759
If she can't cook,

79
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:46,160
we can buy the ingredients ourselves

80
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,399
and cook ourselves.

81
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:52,560
You think so too,

82
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,360
but it sounds unreliable, right?

83
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,519
Can't cook.

84
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,079
Then let's make a birthday cake.

85
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,000
Look over here.

86
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:11,199
I've got a bunch of cake recipes saved.

87
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,399
They're all here.

88
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,480
Let's go.

89
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,040
Change clothes, change clothes!

90
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,680
Surprise!

91
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,519
Happy birthday!

92
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:57,079
How did you—

93
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:58,639
Are you surprised?

94
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,600
But—

95
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,079
We have to thank Yin Zhanqi for opening the door.

96
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,480
Happy birthday!

97
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,399
Thank you.

98
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,199
Look,

99
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,480
this cake isn't store-bought.

100
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,959
Hui and I made it ourselves.

101
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,959
You two made it?

102
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,920
But Li Zhenggui did most of the work.

103
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,240
Not really...

104
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,759
But while we were making it,

105
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:23,199
there were a few little mishaps.

106
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,079
But it was worth it.

107
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,519
Thank you both.

108
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:32,319
It's your birthday.

109
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,800
It's rare for us to show off our skills.

110
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,800
Make a wish!

111
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,399
Okay.

112
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:08,360
Hello?

113
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:10,279
Mom.

114
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:11,560
I'm not home right now.

115
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,079
Okay, okay.

116
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:14,160
I'll call you later.

117
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,800
Bye.

118
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,600
Thank you.

119
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,959
Is it good?

120
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,240
Not bad.

121
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,159
Yes.

122
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:38,559
I told you it was good.

123
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:48,559
Mom

124
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,279
Li Zhenggui

125
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,840
Long time no see.

126
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,840
Come here, let me take a look.

127
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,840
You finally gained some weight.

128
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,240
Of course.

129
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:58,480
Come, let's sit and talk.

130
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,720
Mom

131
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,000
Is there something you need?

132
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,039
Why did you ask me out?

133
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:11,919
I need your help with something.

134
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:17,720
What could I possibly help with?

135
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,159
The ten percent shares you hold for me—

136
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,039
Transfer them to me this month.

137
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,320
Just for now.

138
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,480
Is something wrong with the company?

139
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,480
Nothing's wrong.

140
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:40,159
Don't ask so many questions.

141
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,039
Did you and Dad have a fight?

142
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,440
If something's going on,

143
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,240
just tell me directly.

144
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,960
Your dad and I—

145
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:57,559
We...

146
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:00,360
are divorced.

147
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,399
Divorced?

148
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,000
It's not April Fool's Day.

149
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,480
I'm in a tough spot right now.

150
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,960
If even you won't help me,

151
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,759
things will be even harder for me.

152
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:25,120
Wait, Mom—

153
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:28,360
You and Dad have been together for years.

154
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:30,399
Was it all fake?

155
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:31,559
Decades as husband and wife—

156
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:32,919
You just end it like that?

157
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,159
Li Zhenggui,

158
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:38,559
There are things

159
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:40,879
I've never told you.

160
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,759
When there's time,

161
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:45,240
I'll explain it to you slowly.

162
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,759
I don't need explanations.

163
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:48,799
I just want a whole family.

164
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:50,600
I know.

165
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,200
Given the situation now,

166
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:53,559
it's hard for you to accept.

167
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:55,000
But you need to understand,

168
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,159
people have to pay for their mistakes.

169
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:58,639
There are consequences.

170
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:00,559
I won't enable your dad anymore.

171
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:04,039
Wait, what did Dad do wrong?

172
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,360
Why do you want those shares?

173
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,679
To kick him out of the company.

174
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:10,240
You only tell me after the divorce?

175
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,279
What do you take me for?

176
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,960
Your dad—

177
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,919
He cheated on me.

178
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,120
He wants me out of the company too.

179
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,320
What am I supposed to do?

180
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:42,480
I need some time.

181
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:45,320
Li Zhenggui,

182
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:48,879
I need a little time.

183
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,039
Li Zhenggui...

184
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:11,039
Why has Li Zhenggui been gone so long?

185
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,080
She's back.

186
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,879
Come here!

187
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,039
We saved a piece of cake for you.

188
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,320
Are you hungry?

189
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:58,720
It's fine if you don't want cake.

190
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,000
I'll make you something else.

191
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,120
What do you want to eat?

192
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:02,519
I'm not hungry.

193
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:19,600
Have some water.

194
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,240
Right.

195
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:26,759
Your dad just sent you a delivery.

196
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,200
Take a look.

197
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,480
You lost your bank card.

198
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:50,960
This is my dad's supplementary gold card.

199
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,320
Why did your dad suddenly

200
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,279
give you his own credit card?

201
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:58,000
Because I'm their bargaining chip now.

202
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:06,960
I'm fine.

203
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,879
I'm tired.

204
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,759
I'm going to bed.

205
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,279
Don't worry.

206
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,240
Good night.

207
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,399
She just said "bargaining chip."

208
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,679
I think so.

209
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:57,320
My mom told me

210
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,360
Li Zhenggui's parents

211
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,840
are getting divorced now.

212
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,639
It even went to court.

213
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,440
Parents suddenly become enemies.

214
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,600
Li Zhenggui must feel awful.

215
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,039
Look at her these days.

216
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,840
She spends every day at the bar.

217
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:14,480
She won't come home

218
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,840
unless she's drunk.

219
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:17,799
She's so self-destructive now.

220
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:18,440
I...

221
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:20,000
It makes me angry to see her like this.

222
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,679
I understand how she feels.

223
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:25,080
She can't solve this problem.

224
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:27,200
She can only escape by drinking.

225
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,799
Does running away help?

226
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,080
Does drinking help?

227
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,080
She's only hurting herself in the end.

228
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,000
She's so down and out now.

229
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,440
I really should scold her.

230
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,960
Don't scold her.

231
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:41,519
Especially now,

232
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:43,960
we should be understanding and patient.

233
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,240
Otherwise,

234
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,320
tonight,

235
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,559
let's make something tasty.

236
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:49,000
Talk to her, cheer her up.

237
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:52,120
That's all we can do.

238
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,039
Young people nowadays

239
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,240
face all kinds

240
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,440
of uncertainty in life.

241
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:08,039
A little humor, a lot of composure—

242
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,279
that's how they cope.

243
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:11,840
I've tried.

244
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,679
I've let go.

245
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:13,960
I've made peace.

246
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:16,440
In short, no self-torment.

247
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,600
Today, I'll make a vegetarian

248
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,919
Vegetarian Sukiyaki.

249
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,879
With this gentle sweetness,

250
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:25,000
to soothe Li Zhenggui's hangover.

251
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:26,720
I hope

252
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,399
it can also comfort

253
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,320
her restless heart.

254
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,119
Sukiyaki...

255
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,440
Looks delicious.

256
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,599
This is vegetarian Sukiyaki.

257
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:15,119
Also called Vegetarian Sukiyaki.

258
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,000
Buddha-like, that's nice.

259
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,440
Buddha-like means not worrying.

260
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,839
No need to think about anything.

261
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:29,680
Just go with the flow for a day.

262
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,559
Let Li Zhenggui have a drink for a day.

263
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:50,359
Eat up.

264
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:51,359
Let's dig in.

265
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,160
Stop drinking.

266
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,480
Look at yourself right now.

267
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:19,400
Your dark circles are almost on the floor.

268
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,200
Isn't that great?

269
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,000
No need for eyeshadow now.

270
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,079
Fine, I won't drink anymore.

271
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,680
My problems are none of your business.

272
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,480
I'm tangping—it's my choice, my life.

273
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:41,359
Li Zhenggui

274
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:43,759
Avoiding problems won't solve anything.

275
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:45,000
You still have the two of us.

276
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,680
If the sky falls, we'll face it together.

277
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,119
There's no alcohol at home.

278
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:53,359
I'm going out for a drink.

279
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:54,359
Oh, right.

280
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:56,119
Tomorrow.

281
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:57,279
Is Auntie

282
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:00,200
meeting your ex's parents to talk?

283
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:05,000
Good luck to you both.

284
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,319
Li Zhenggui

285
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:07,400
Hui

286
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:09,160
Let her have some time alone.

287
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,799
I understand what both of you mean.

288
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,079
Mom.

289
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,440
The reason I didn't let you join

290
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:49,599
is because

291
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:51,200
I know

292
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:54,200
you wanted to protect me.

293
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,599
His parents are decent people.

294
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:01,799
They also criticized Runze.

295
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:03,759
They also said

296
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:07,599
What did they say?

297
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,839
His mom said they could compensate you.

298
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,240
I don't want their compensation.

299
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,319
Let me finish, listen to me.

300
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:20,920
They said

301
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,640
they'd give you some money.

302
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:25,839
As for the child,

303
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:28,839
it's up to you to decide.

304
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,240
They said you're still young.

305
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,559
Don't let the child

306
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,119
hold back your future.

307
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:45,920
They really said that.

308
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,079
Hui

309
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,240
Listen to me, Hui.

310
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,599
We don't need to care what others think.

311
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,920
Just live our own lives well.

312
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,519
As long as your conscience is clear.

313
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,799
Always remember,

314
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,079
no matter what you decide,

315
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:13,000
your dad and I

316
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,599
will always be your strongest support.

317
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,200
Don't cry.

318
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:27,920
We're all adults now.

319
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:36,480
No more tears, okay?

320
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,119
Hui

321
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,680
Let's go home first.

322
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:27,000
How are you feeling?

323
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,839
Why didn't Auntie come back with you?

324
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:32,839
My mom wanted to take care of my dad.

325
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,000
She went back.

326
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,559
My mind is a mess right now.

327
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,680
I really don't know what to do.

328
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:52,440
Li Zhenggui

329
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,440
Still no news?

330
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:56,839
Li Zhenggui messaged me.

331
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:58,000
She said she's staying at a hotel.

332
00:25:58,319 --> 00:25:59,559
She wants to be alone.

333
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:00,880
She asked us not to bother her.

334
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:08,839
Looks like she doesn't want to come back yet.

335
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:15,680
If something ends badly,

336
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:17,759
it means it's not truly over.

337
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,599
All we can do now

338
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:20,960
is wait.

339
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:27,839
You should rest for a bit.

340
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:29,000
I'll go make you dinner.

341
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,039
Don't bother.

342
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:33,119
I'm not hungry.

343
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:35,039
Hungry or not,

344
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,680
you still need to eat dinner.

345
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:43,720
It's for him to eat.

346
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,559
Everything's tidied up.

347
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:20,599
See?

348
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,880
I finally got a chance

349
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,640
to clean up her mess.

350
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:27,680
Isn't everything back in order now?

351
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,359
Chaos is a kind of order too.

352
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:36,960
I promise,

353
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,440
once she's back,

354
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,640
in less than a day,

355
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:41,880
it'll be messy again.

356
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:46,799
That rascal Li Zhenggui.

357
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:47,920
Hurry back, will you?

358
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:49,920
The house is suddenly so quiet.

359
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:51,519
I'm not used to it.

360
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,240
Nian'er

361
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,279
I'm planning to quit my job.

362
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,839
Quit?

363
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,680
Have the baby.

364
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,160
Then you really shouldn't quit.

365
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:09,079
Without a job,

366
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:09,720
no income,

367
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,960
how will you raise the child?

368
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,440
I've saved up some money.

369
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:23,440
It should last for a while.

370
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,839
Didn't I just get promoted?

371
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,640
My workload increased a lot.

372
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,640
With my current health,

373
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,240
I can barely manage.

374
00:28:32,599 --> 00:28:34,200
But as the months go by,

375
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,119
this workload

376
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:36,519
I definitely can't keep up.

377
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:38,400
Then talk to the company,

378
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:38,920
see if you can

379
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,039
reduce your workload a bit.

380
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:42,440
Even though the company fired Li Yihan,

381
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,400
the competition is still fierce.

382
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:47,640
I'm quitting.

383
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,920
Plenty of people want my position.

384
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,240
So,

385
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:53,880
instead of waiting for the company

386
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,599
to find a reason to fire me,

387
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,799
I'd rather resign myself.

388
00:28:57,799 --> 00:28:59,519
But you're pregnant!

389
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,240
Online they keep saying birth rates are low.

390
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,519
Shouldn't companies care more for pregnant women?

391
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:08,240
A company isn't a charity.

392
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,319
They won't pay people to do nothing.

393
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:11,079
Besides,

394
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:13,160
since I got pregnant,

395
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,839
I realized promotions, raises, cars, houses—

396
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:17,000
for me,

397
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,079
they don't seem that appealing anymore.

398
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:27,200
Honestly, I've thought about this for a long time.

399
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,440
If I have to

400
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,720
choose between work and my child,

401
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,960
make a choice,

402
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,000
I'd choose my child without hesitation.

403
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,759
Alright then.

404
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:47,440
Since you've made up your mind,

405
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,599
I support you.

406
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,599
Don't worry.

407
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:52,839
You still have me.

408
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,119
I'll make sure you and the baby

409
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:57,319
are both healthy and chubby.

410
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:06,720
Nian'er

411
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:09,599
I'm planning

412
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:12,359
to go home and get ready for the baby.

413
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,720
You're going back home?

414
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,079
My parents are getting older.

415
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,599
I've been out here on my own

416
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:23,039
working hard for so long,

417
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,839
rarely having time with them.

418
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:28,880
Now that I'm having a child,

419
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,200
I suddenly understand

420
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,279
my mom's concern for me.

421
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,000
So I plan to return to my hometown

422
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,480
and be with my parents

423
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,319
to welcome this new baby together.

424
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,200
Yin Zhanqi

425
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:57,480
is a really good person.

426
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:01,240
Yin Zhanqi truly is a good guy.

427
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,079
But I've come to realize

428
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,000
marriage and love aren't the same.

429
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,599
Maybe Yin Zhanqi

430
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:11,960
is someone very suitable for marriage,

431
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,599
but he doesn't truly love me.

432
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,920
He seems to treat you really well.

433
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,039
He wants to cherish you above all else.

434
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,400
The day after my birthday,

435
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,839
he tried to ask my colleagues about my age.

436
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:33,599
After he found out how old I am,

437
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,440
he said,

438
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,000
"If you don't have a baby soon, it'll be too late."

439
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:45,039
There are other details, but I won't get into them.

440
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:47,359
In his eyes,

441
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:49,680
I'm a good wife and mother,

442
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:51,680
someone fit for marriage,

443
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,240
but not Liang Nian'er herself.

444
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:00,160
This isn't a path I have to take.

445
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,559
So I decided

446
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,240
before we ever got together,

447
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:09,359
to turn him down.

448
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,359
I already turned him down yesterday.
