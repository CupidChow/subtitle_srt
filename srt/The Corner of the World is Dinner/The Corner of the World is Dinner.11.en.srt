1
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,520
Longan, Poria, and Chinese yam

2
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:39,639
Goji berries

3
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,199
Hui, you called me?

4
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,280
The coffee shop owner told me

5
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,080
Zhen Gui showed up

6
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,360
I'm waiting for her at the entrance

7
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:10,960
Come quickly

8
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,479
Okay

9
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:12,560
Send me your location

10
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,199
Okay

11
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,919
You take the front, I'll take the back

12
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,000
We can't let her get away

13
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,120
There's no back door

14
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,560
Go, go, go

15
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:12,839
I really didn't expect it

16
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:14,839
I always see her lounging around

17
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:17,360
Doodling on the sofa

18
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,639
I thought she was just scribbling

19
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,720
Turns out

20
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:24,480
Her drawings are actually pretty good

21
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:27,639
What?

22
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,800
Doesn't Zhen Gui always say

23
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,160
she can't find her direction

24
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,759
All these years

25
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:36,560
she's never finished anything?

26
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,360
So, think about it

27
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,040
Why don't we help her publish this art book?

28
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,639
We both like it

29
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,639
Others will surely appreciate her art too

30
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,480
I happen to know a famous editor

31
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:51,000
But

32
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,920
Editor Chi is right here

33
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:08,759
This is the place you mentioned

34
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:09,959
The private kitchen that's supposed to be amazing

35
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:10,879
Yes, this is it

36
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,480
Isn't this just a regular apartment building?

37
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,279
Yeah

38
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,279
I'm leaving

39
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,120
I swear, I'm not lying

40
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,480
I'm not going

41
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,480
Why would I lie to you?

42
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:22,600
Hello, Editor Chi

43
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,639
We've been waiting for you

44
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,360
Editor Chi, this is...

45
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:29,439
Smells so good

46
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,480
Isn't it cute?

47
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:42,480
It's pretty cute

48
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,319
Editor Chi, please wait a moment

49
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,120
There's more

50
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,040
No rush, no rush

51
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,639
No rush, no rush

52
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:52,480
It's fine, it's fine

53
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,759
What a feast

54
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,839
What's this?

55
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:04,040
Let me introduce the dishes

56
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,560
Basque-style stewed chicken

57
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,920
Rosemary prawns

58
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:08,480
Teriyaki salmon

59
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,480
Are all the dishes ready?

60
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,800
Please, help yourself

61
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:24,639
Delicious

62
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,040
Try some fish

63
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,279
This fish is so tender

64
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,600
Have a prawn

65
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,319
Delicious

66
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,000
So tasty

67
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,320
Editor Chi

68
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,000
This private kitchen meal

69
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,320
How do you like the taste?

70
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,200
Delicious

71
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,559
It's unbelievably good

72
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:10,240
It soothes me from the inside out

73
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,080
And what about Zhen Gui's picture book?

74
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,080
It comforts the soul

75
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:21,000
So publishing it shouldn't be a problem, right?

76
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,240
Our publishing house

77
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,960
is planning an event

78
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:28,559
with the theme "Discovering the Good and Beauty in Life"

79
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,960
This picture book

80
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,919
fits our selection criteria perfectly

81
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:34,840
But

82
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,240
You'll need to provide a 20,000 yuan

83
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,360
initial startup fee

84
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,279
Okay

85
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,960
It's really good

86
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,080
Ma Yong Yong

87
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,840
I really like his work

88
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,639
So, what about Zhen Gui's picture book?

89
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:23,960
By the way

90
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,000
Can you get Ma Yong Yong's autograph for me?

91
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,960
Zhen Gui's book is pretty good

92
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,960
Let's talk about it later

93
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:57,360
Sis

94
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,519
How much is this book?

95
00:10:58,799 --> 00:10:59,600
Eighteen

96
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,320
Wait a moment

97
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,480
I'll go find my mom

98
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:22,879
Baby

99
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,879
The flowers at home have bloomed

100
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:25,799
They smell wonderful

101
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:26,679
Smell them

102
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,039
This

103
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,480
is from the mother of that autistic child

104
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,519
She wrote it to me

105
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,039
She said she's very grateful to me

106
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,240
Because of my drawings

107
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,879
her child

108
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,120
started to love the beauty of this world

109
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:28,039
She said she's tried for six years

110
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:30,039
and was about to give up

111
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,919
But because of me

112
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:35,559
she's found hope again

113
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,039
Before, I

114
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:45,679
often said I just wanted to take it easy.

115
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,519
I wanted to slack off.

116
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,639
But deep down, I couldn't accept it.

117
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,519
Because I couldn't find a way out.

118
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,039
But the truth is,

119
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:59,240
we can't just lie down and give up.

120
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,639
If you do that,

121
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,240
you miss out on so many chances.

122
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,120
I don't want to waste my youth.

123
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,519
Thank you all.

124
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,080
It's all thanks to Nian'er.

125
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:16,240
Her cooking impressed Editor Chi.

126
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,000
And Hui,

127
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,720
she took a risk and brought Editor Chi home.

128
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,279
But Zhen Gui,

129
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:22,480
how did you get

130
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,919
the reader's letter and this picture book?

131
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:25,240
We both couldn't reach you.

132
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,960
Did the publisher finally call you?

133
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,480
No.

134
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,679
This manuscript—

135
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:32,240
I lost it a long time ago.

136
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,360
I thought I'd misplaced it.

137
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,320
But that day, while browsing a bookstore,

138
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,120
I accidentally saw this picture book.

139
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,159
I thought I'd hit the jackpot.

140
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:43,000
Someone found my manuscript,

141
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,720
and even published it.

142
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,360
So I rushed to the publisher.

143
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:48,879
And then—

144
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:51,440
I really did get lucky.

145
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,240
You two are my lucky stars.

146
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,480
You love me.

147
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:59,480
Of course we love you.

148
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,759
I love you both too.

149
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:02,440
Since you love us,

150
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,240
next time, don't

151
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,679
disappear without a word.

152
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,639
Don't run away from problems.

153
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:07,440
Talk to us.

154
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,840
We'll help you figure it out.

155
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:14,879
I'm sorry.

156
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:17,720
I won't avoid things anymore.

157
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,279
But—

158
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:21,360
I've made up my mind.

159
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,960
I want to go back home

160
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,240
and stay for a while.

161
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,039
No matter what happens,

162
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,360
I want to give it a try.

163
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,000
I want to see if I can

164
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,559
save my parents' relationship.

165
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,320
You're leaving too?

166
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,080
Me too.

167
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:04,480
Take two.

168
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:12,679
Sorry, sorry.

169
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,279
Be careful.

170
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,480
You bumped my leg.

171
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,879
You walk inside.

172
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:19,320
I'll check over there.

173
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:31,720
Two pieces.

174
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:36,480
These are all on sale.

175
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:40,519
These two are expensive.

176
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:42,120
I'll look for regular ones.

177
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,879
I picked these out specially.

178
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:44,960
I want this one.

179
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,919
We're going over budget today.

180
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:48,240
It's my treat tonight.

181
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,399
I'm making you all

182
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,720
an unforgettable meal.

183
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,639
Now I don't want to leave even more.

184
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:55,360
What should I do?

185
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,120
Then my plan worked.

186
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,600
Tonight's dinner

187
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,080
is about saying goodbye,

188
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,200
and new beginnings.

189
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:23,039
I'll use the freshest ingredients of the season

190
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,879
to make them a truly special dish.

191
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:31,080
Countless spring bamboo shoots fill the forest,
(An ancient Chinese poem about the bamboo shoot season)

192
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,200
hidden from passersby.
(An ancient Chinese poem about the bamboo shoot season)

193
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:36,600
This season,

194
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,360
nothing is fresher than bamboo shoots.

195
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,679
After Grain Rain,

196
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:43,600
you'll have to wait until next year.

197
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,480
I want to pour all my best wishes

198
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:52,360
into this rich Yan Du Xian.

199
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:42,680
While it simmers,

200
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,640
I'll make Tang Bu Shuai,
(a sweet glutinous rice dessert from Guangdong, symbolizing sweetness and togetherness)

201
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,680
Sweetness and togetherness, a happiness that sticks with us.

202
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,799
Sweetness and togetherness, a happiness that sticks with us.

203
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:05,480
The soup is thick now.

204
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,240
Time to add the bamboo shoots.

205
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,400
Scoop out the rice balls, cool them in water.

206
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,799
Brown sugar, warm water.

207
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:55,960
Melt it over low heat.

208
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,400
Pour in the cooked rice balls.

209
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,880
Simmer on low heat.

210
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,920
Keep stirring so it doesn't burn.

211
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,599
Coat them in thick caramel sauce.

212
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:28,640
Finally, sprinkle with sesame and dried osmanthus.

213
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:40,240
Prepare Changsha-style Spicy Mapo Tofu.

214
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,039
Zhen Gui can't live without spice.

215
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:43,559
She kept complaining

216
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:45,680
she hasn't had anything spicy in days.

217
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,799
The secret to Changsha-style Spicy Mapo Tofu

218
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,279
is garlic and chili peppers.

219
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:54,599
And doubanjiang.

220
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,960
Let me introduce

221
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,920
a special dessert from Guangdong—

222
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,759
Tang Bu Shuai,
(a sweet glutinous rice dessert from Guangdong, symbolizing sweetness and togetherness)

223
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,359
Changsha-style Spicy Mapo Tofu.

224
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,160
Nian'er's version of Yan Du Xian.

225
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,039
Try it now!

226
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:03,519
This is my culinary masterpiece.

227
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:11,680
Start with the soup.

228
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,480
Why not have something sweet?

229
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,480
Eat more.

230
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:36,119
This meal is truly unforgettable.

231
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,680
Thank you.

232
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,680
May our future be just as wonderful.

233
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:51,480
Wishing us a beautiful future.

234
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:53,880
Wishing us a beautiful future.

235
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,039
No one else can rent my room.

236
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,240
I want that too.

237
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,680
This is my royalty payment.

238
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,680
You have to accept it.

239
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,599
I want to help you fulfill your wish.

240
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,400
Take Grandma back to Xinjiang.

241
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,240
Thank you.

242
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:47,880
Hui.

243
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:49,799
I drew this.

244
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,440
This is how I imagine

245
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,480
your baby will look.

246
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,680
Doesn't it look like you as a child?

247
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,200
So cute.

248
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:01,680
Okay.

249
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,599
I'll accept it for the baby.

250
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:08,359
But—

251
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,720
I haven't prepared gifts for you yet.

252
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:13,039
I don't have a gift either.

253
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,920
This picture book,

254
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:20,240
and last night's dinner,

255
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,440
are the best gifts you've given me.

256
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:42,200
When will we meet again?

257
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,000
I don't know.

258
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,839
But I do know—

259
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:50,200
our future will be beautiful.
