1
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,120
Sleepwalker

2
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,599
Never wake her up

3
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,919
She'll turn dumb

4
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:42,759
Though she's already dumb enough

5
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,840
What mischief are you up to now?

6
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:17,199
I just really miss

7
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,120
when we snuggled under blankets as kids

8
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,560
and shared our dreams

9
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,519
and shared snacks together

10
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,759
We were neighbors back then

11
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,839
Admit it

12
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Were you faking sleepwalking again

13
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,920
to scare Sis Nian'er?

14
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,720
Life needs some fun, don't you think?

15
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,600
Plus only her room has snacks

16
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,720
What was I supposed to do?

17
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,399
You've loved snacks since childhood

18
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:43,480
My mom still talks about it

19
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,439
Says whenever you visited

20
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,959
you'd even nibble on nearly expired bread

21
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,519
from our fridge

22
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,120
That's my only hobby

23
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,720
How could I just give it up?

24
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,639
You never come to my bed without reason

25
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:08,040
Not sleeping at this late hour

26
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,079
You must want something

27
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,720
I woke up suddenly

28
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:20,439
and realized

29
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:25,439
tomorrow's our first anniversary

30
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,079
Not tomorrow - today

31
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,199
It's past midnight already

32
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:29,959
Right

33
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:32,639
Shouldn't we celebrate?

34
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,959
Nian'er's cooked for us a whole year

35
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,439
I've gained five pounds

36
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,560
My mom cooked for twenty years

37
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,439
and wasn't this effective

38
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,480
But she's been having trouble walking

39
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,519
Shouldn't we

40
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,800
take her out for a nice meal?

41
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:54,519
If you really want to thank Sis Nian'er

42
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:56,199
learn to cook properly

43
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:58,000
One meal out means

44
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,600
days of home cooking after

45
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,600
Speaking of spending, I must say

46
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,040
Aren't you weaned yet?

47
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,120
Talk of financial independence

48
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:09,600
for a whole year now

49
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,079
The flagpole fell

50
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,800
and we just left it there

51
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,839
Also

52
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,519
Our company's doing poorly

53
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,439
Whole department got pay cuts

54
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,240
Who says I'm not weaned?

55
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,639
This month I returned

56
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,800
all money to my parents

57
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,040
I'm officially broke now

58
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:31,199
Plus my livestream earnings

59
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,600
won't be withdrawable for days

60
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:35,639
You're right

61
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,720
This year we should probably

62
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,240
live more simply

63
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:46,600
Like eating... chips

64
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:53,199
Wipe your hands before chips

65
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,839
I've been truly happy this year

66
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:14,120
I'll be self-sufficient soon

67
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,560
But

68
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:21,600
One thing puzzles me

69
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,680
What really is life?

70
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,639
Life

71
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,079
is like train travel

72
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,480
Sometimes you board wrong trains

73
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,480
but still reach right places

74
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,480
Like me

75
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,639
I never planned to teach

76
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,319
Now sleep tight

77
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,680
Mind your head

78
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,519
and body

79
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:13,799
Not my brilliant brain?

80
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,799
But Cong Ge

81
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,440
today's Sunday

82
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:29,679
Morning

83
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:39,840
Twelve hours straight

84
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:40,799
Youth is wonderful

85
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,200
Young? We're almost thirty

86
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:46,519
Zhenggui sleepwalked again

87
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:47,360
Aren't you scared?

88
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,200
Oh, used to it

89
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,039
What do you two want to eat today?

90
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:59,759
Today is our first anniversary.

91
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:01,440
I think we can have seafood.

92
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,519
We can have lobster as the main course.

93
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,480
Paired with champagne.

94
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,679
And two - one brown crab, and...

95
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:08,919
Stop right there, Li Zhenggui.

96
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,120
Alright, it's rare we both have a day off.

97
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,919
Get ready and let's go to the supermarket.

98
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:16,080
Let's splurge a little.

99
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,039
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

100
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,919
Change clothes, change clothes.

101
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:23,639
Let's go.

102
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,679
Hurry up.

103
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:30,039
The brown crabs will sell out.

104
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:46,720
Are we doing a fashion show?

105
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
Supermodel - that's me.

106
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:53,399
Let's go.

107
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,320
I got roped into work, you two go.

108
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:17,200
Fine, I'll cook tonight then.

109
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:17,960
I'll try to make it back.

110
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,519
I'm off now.

111
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:19,320
Take care.

112
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,320
Hello?

113
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,600
Teacher Zhang, we have a big client coming tomorrow.

114
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,000
They want to consult about group classes.

115
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Go back to the office and organize the materials.

116
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:40,399
I'll send them to you right away.

117
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,600
We'll be there soon too.

118
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,519
Alright.

119
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,879
Good things come in pairs.

120
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,039
Is this person targeting you?

121
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,200
He used to rush to help you with everything.

122
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,399
Now he's like this.

123
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:52,200
So annoying.

124
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:53,480
Whatever.

125
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,639
I'll go work now.

126
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,200
You're going to the supermarket alone?

127
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:57,720
Be careful.

128
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,440
Wait, can I spend money then?

129
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,720
Teacher Liang.

130
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,399
The situation here might not be good.

131
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,399
Do you want to wait before going in?

132
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:14,919
It's fine.

133
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:16,320
What exactly is the situation now?

134
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,360
The director said I'm too inexperienced.

135
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,200
The voice actors aren't in good form either.

136
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,320
And this job is urgent.

137
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:23,399
Sorry for troubling you, Teacher Liang.

138
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,320
No problem, give me the script, I'll handle it.

139
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,639
Hello, I'm voice director Liang Nian'er.

140
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,200
Susu, it's me.

141
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,440
Let's do a test.

142
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:49,679
Okay, Sis Nian'er.

143
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,240
Excuse me, I'll step out for a moment.

144
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,519
I don't like taking brothel scene scripts.

145
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,720
Cong Ge knows my principles.

146
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,799
What did you tell him?

147
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:11,279
Sorry, sorry, Teacher Liang.

148
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,440
I really didn't know.

149
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,200
The director scolded me too harshly earlier.

150
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,320
And it's Teacher Susu's first time.

151
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,440
Taking this kind of role.

152
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,679
I panicked.

153
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:19,279
So I quickly told Manager Li.

154
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:20,200
Didn't explain in detail.

155
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,200
Didn't expect he'd send you here.

156
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,120
Are you professional voice actors?

157
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,679
Can't you scream louder?

158
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,200
Can't you be more flirtatious?

159
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,480
Have you had boyfriends?

160
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,799
Director, take a break.

161
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,559
We're all professionals.

162
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:39,879
We can meet your requirements.

163
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:47,080
Susu, try to remember.

164
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,840
We previously dubbed a game.

165
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,840
We invited a senior to voice the fox spirit.

166
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,759
Do you remember that senior's performance?

167
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:54,080
Yes, Sis Nian'er.

168
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:56,440
Let's try it in that style a few times.

169
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,440
Okay, Sis Nian'er.

170
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:31,720
Hey.

171
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,080
Where's my food?

172
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,639
Xiaoyu, give these to the mixing engineer.

173
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:48,279
Okay.

174
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:51,080
No wonder you're an experienced voice director.

175
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,279
I think you're amazing.

176
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,799
I only have this little scene.

177
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:57,000
How many all-nighters did we shoot?

178
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,720
I auditioned over 40 female extras in Hengdian.

179
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,559
Right, boss?

180
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:01,799
Yes, yes, well shot.

181
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:04,399
Let me tell you, this lighting, this composition.

182
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:05,759
This dialogue, this...

183
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,279
You pursue your art

184
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,679
We're in no position to judge

185
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,080
But for those working with you

186
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,360
You've crossed all boundaries

187
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,919
No matter what role we take

188
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,960
we always maintain professionalism

189
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,679
Just because we play certain roles

190
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:19,679
doesn't mean you can disrespect us

191
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,919
Meeting you has been most unpleasant

192
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,080
May your film be a box office hit

193
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,440
Good riddance

194
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:27,799
You little brat

195
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,399
Teacher Liang, thank you for your hard work

196
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,879
Challenge: spend not a single penny

197
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,440
yet bring seafood home

198
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,240
Auntie

199
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,320
What fish do you have today?

200
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:55,799
Young lady, haven't seen you in days

201
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:57,720
All these fish are fresh today

202
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,840
Take a look yourself

203
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,519
Okay

204
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:08,840
Auntie, are you feeling unwell?

205
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,840
Gout, you wouldn't know how painful it is

206
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,200
Have a look

207
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,480
See if there's anything you like

208
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,879
I'll pack it up for you

209
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,519
If you're not buying

210
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,799
I'll close up shop

211
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,440
Auntie, how about this

212
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:29,000
I'll work for you this afternoon selling fish

213
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:31,519
Just tell me what to do and I'll do it

214
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,480
But could you give me a big fish in return?

215
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,000
This job's too tough for you

216
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,279
Standing here all day is exhausting

217
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,879
No no, it's not hard

218
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:43,440
No way

219
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:44,720
Oh dear, young lady

220
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,200
You really want to help me sell fish?

221
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,080
Absolutely!

222
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,120
Here, put this on

223
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:02,559
Take that

224
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:04,039
The special fish scaling knife

225
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:04,480
This one

226
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,200
Yes yes yes

227
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,200
Start from the tail

228
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,079
Scrape upwards along the scales

229
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,160
From this tail

230
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,519
Follow the scales toward the head, yes here

231
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:15,000
Use the right pressure, that's it

232
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,519
Enough

233
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,480
This one

234
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,680
Okay

235
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,000
Go weigh it over there

236
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,759
28 yuan per half kilo

237
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,440
Okay

238
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,240
Fifty-six

239
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,720
Scan the payment code there

240
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,640
Okay, thanks

241
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:34,480
We've got shrimp, fish, turtle - everything!

242
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:37,319
This one

243
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:38,720
Yes this one, this one

244
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:41,839
Right, there's a technique to this

245
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:43,440
See how the scales are scraped off

246
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,640
without damaging the flesh, good job

247
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:48,799
Turtle, right?

248
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:50,720
Which one looks better to you?

249
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,880
180, okay

250
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,839
180, just scan over there, thanks

251
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,079
Twenty-five yuan

252
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:57,319
Just scan here

253
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,440
That one

254
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,200
Is this one okay?

255
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,240
Sure

256
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,759
Young lady, you've worked hard today.

257
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:09,640
Wipe your sweat quickly.

258
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,759
I won't sell this big fish.

259
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:13,640
I'll take it home to cook later.

260
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,000
Thank you.

261
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,400
Boss, give me a bigger fish.

262
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,000
I want it steamed.

263
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,720
Oh dear, I'm so sorry.

264
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:20,519
I got a great helper today.

265
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:22,200
See, all the big fish are sold out.

266
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,640
Only these small ones left.

267
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,400
My grandson's birthday today.

268
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,000
He's been begging for fish.

269
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,079
How about something else for him?

270
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,480
Here, take this home to cook.

271
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,559
Thanks.

272
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:33,839
Sorry, big brother.

273
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:35,720
Check others, I'll give discount.

274
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,680
Uncle.

275
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,640
Here, take this.

276
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:42,359
How can I accept this?

277
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:42,680
Young lady.

278
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,319
Didn't I tell you to cook it?

279
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:45,559
It's fine.

280
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:47,599
Perfect timing.

281
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:49,279
Let me trade this bread with you.

282
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:50,319
Thank you.

283
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,720
Oh my, young lady.

284
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,200
You're so kind.

285
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,640
Pretty face, kind heart too.

286
00:18:58,359 --> 00:18:59,720
This is really...

287
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,599
Sister, sister!

288
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,440
What sweetened your mouth?

289
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:13,599
Break us some bread.

290
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,319
Using bread to catch turtles?

291
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:20,200
Yes!

292
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:22,799
Just put bread on the hook,

293
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,799
then trap them in bottles.

294
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,200
You know so much.

295
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:30,160
But...

296
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:31,920
This season now,

297
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,880
mother turtles have babies.

298
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,039
If you catch the mother,

299
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:39,440
what about the babies?

300
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:46,599
But you're very clever.

301
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:48,599
Your contraption here

302
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:50,440
actually makes sense.

303
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:53,920
How about trading bread?

304
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,799
What flavor is it?

305
00:19:58,839 --> 00:19:59,640
Try some.

306
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:02,960
Mmm.

307
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,920
Thanks.

308
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:18,599
Zhenggui.

309
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:21,160
Fishing?

310
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,319
Long story.

311
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:30,000
I'll act spoiled, need your love.

312
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:33,799
Talk at home.

313
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,920
What's wrong?

314
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:00,880
I finished my proposal.

315
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,319
When are you coming?

316
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,240
Sorry, Teacher Zhang.

317
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:13,319
Family emergency, can't come.

318
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:14,279
Others are all busy.

319
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:15,319
Some can't make it.

320
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:16,599
I had them work from home.

321
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:19,079
Email me the proposal.

322
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:20,400
I'll reply later.

323
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:28,440
Nian'er.

324
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,640
Such a disgusting person.

325
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,519
How do you tolerate it?

326
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,680
I'd have hit them already.

327
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:37,680
Such people at work are inevitable.

328
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,839
I've faced this before too.

329
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,720
So when it happens again,

330
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,680
I try to avoid it.

331
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,799
Keep the right mindset.

332
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:47,119
When meeting bad people,

333
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:48,359
let it pass quickly.

334
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:49,920
Don't be hard on yourself.

335
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:52,599
More experience, more work.

336
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,920
Eat more good food.

337
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,920
Life becomes better.

338
00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:01,880
I've had similar issues lately.

339
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,000
Lesson learned.

340
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,599
What's wrong?

341
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,200
Shouldn't have trusted Li Yihan.

342
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:28,839
Don't dwell on unhappiness.

343
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:31,680
Now it's my time to love you.

344
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,759
Zhenggui's dream seafood feast

345
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:55,920
though ruined,

346
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,200
but I'm confident

347
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,160
this humble curry chicken rice

348
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,240
can also comfort them.

349
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,440
Mix a versatile sauce.

350
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,839
Use chili pepper's heat

351
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:26,079
to awaken their taste buds.

352
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,799
For crispness, add oil.

353
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,559
Two minutes, time's up, scoop.

354
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:08,920
Red-green contrast, pleasing.

355
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,480
Chicken, stir-fry fragrant.

356
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,160
Two spoons of light soy sauce, one spoon of oyster sauce

357
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,640
Add an appropriate amount of water

358
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,920
Add fifty grams of curry

359
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,559
Then pour in fifty milliliters of coconut milk

360
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:17,119
Reduce the sauce to the right consistency

361
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,079
Then it's ready to serve

362
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,000
Let's keep it simple today

363
00:25:58,519 --> 00:25:59,319
Cheers

364
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:04,559
To dinner

365
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,799
So blissful

366
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,319
Remember when I was studying abroad a year ago

367
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:36,319
I didn't even know what breakfast was

368
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:38,039
Or even what dinner was

369
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:42,319
But since meeting you two

370
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,519
I've realized dinner is

371
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:47,519
Something truly precious

372
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:53,519
To curry chicken rice

373
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,000
Curry chicken rice
