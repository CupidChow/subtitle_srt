1
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,400
Dear audience,

2
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,560
The exciting moment is about to arrive.

3
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,919
Right now by my side,

4
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:40,240
Nian'er, keep an eye on the lottery ticket for me.

5
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,680
I can only leave this on for fifteen minutes.

6
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:44,840
Going to freshen up.

7
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,639
You still haven't kicked your lottery addiction?

8
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:49,080
This money would be better spent on cabbage.

9
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,039
Why?

10
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,280
Cabbage sounds like "wealth" in Chinese.

11
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:55,400
If I win, I'll buy you a cabbage.

12
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:58,199
According to the lottery rules,

13
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:01,400
we'll first draw six red number balls.

14
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,639
Let's all anticipate together

15
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,879
the first red number ball being drawn.

16
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,680
The first red ball is number one.

17
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:15,479
The second red ball is number eleven.

18
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:21,479
The third red ball is number twelve.

19
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,680
The fourth red ball is number sixteen.

20
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:33,120
The fifth red ball is number eighteen.

21
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:38,120
The sixth red ball is number seven.

22
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,479
What are you doing?

23
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:01,639
Holding a concert or rehearsing a horror movie?

24
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:03,840
You know I'm afraid of the dark.

25
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:05,639
Rehearsing "Alien".

26
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,280
Did you find any aliens in the corner?

27
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:10,240
We won!

28
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:14,319
What prize? Are you sleepwalking too?

29
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,639
No no no, we won the lottery!

30
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,279
Are you sure?

31
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,040
Absolutely certain.

32
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,720
We matched all the red balls.

33
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,519
Let me fix the circuit breaker first.

34
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,839
Let's turn the lights on.

35
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:33,360
No lights! What if someone sees?

36
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,040
Right, right.

37
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,439
In our own home.

38
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:36,600
What are we afraid they'll see?

39
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,079
Our quality of life is about to change.

40
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,560
Should we hire a bodyguard?

41
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:01,000
Li Zhenggui, can you please not put your feet

42
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,639
in my blanket?

43
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,759
Sorry about that.

44
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,480
My legs just go wherever

45
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,600
it's warmest.

46
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,399
Can't control them.

47
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:12,839
Then why don't you try Nian'er's blanket?

48
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:15,920
The other leg's already there.

49
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,199
You two still awake?

50
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:23,959
I just feel like the three of us

51
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:26,279
sleeping on the floor for a lottery ticket

52
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,040
isn't quite right.

53
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:31,399
I just wanted to take this chance

54
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:33,120
for us to squeeze together.

55
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,639
How cozy!

56
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,920
How I feel right now

57
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:40,639
is like being in freezing snow

58
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,199
then suddenly pushed into a warm bed.

59
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,720
Nian'er, what are you talking about?

60
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,040
It's a line from the movie

61
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,040
"Call for Love" where the male lead,

62
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,319
after winning the lottery.

63
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,839
Then I remember another movie line:

64
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:59,279
"Before I only thought about today,

65
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,279
now I can plan my future."

66
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:06,079
That's a good one!

67
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,720
Zhenggui, how about you say

68
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,639
a lottery-related movie line too?

69
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,000
Let me think...

70
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:15,800
"I want to use this money

71
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,759
for what I want to do,

72
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,279
not let others tell me what to do."

73
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,920
That's so Zhenggui!

74
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,439
You didn't just make that up, did you?

75
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:29,800
But we really owe this luck

76
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,439
to Zhenggui.

77
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,160
Nian'er, could you do me a favor?

78
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:39,879
What is it?

79
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,879
Call your boss Cong Ge right now.

80
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:44,560
Tell him you're taking a month off

81
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,279
to vacation in the Maldives.

82
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,439
Isn't that too abrupt?

83
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:52,399
Get the money first, then decide.

84
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:54,319
No, calling Cong Ge at 3 AM?

85
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:55,720
Right now!

86
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,759
I've disliked him for so long.

87
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,839
He has no sense of boundaries,

88
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,720
calling you morning till night,

89
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,839
always assigning you work.

90
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,199
It's disrespectful to you.

91
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,079
Fine, I'll call to get back at him.

92
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,199
Hello, Cong Ge?

93
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,199
It's 3 AM right now.

94
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,199
I'm informing you

95
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,480
I'm taking a month off starting tomorrow.

96
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,480
Don't wait for me at work.

97
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:17,399
You actually called?

98
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,199
I did.

99
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,680
Oh my, I can imagine his face!

100
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,000
This feels so good now!

101
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,879
Nian'er, there's no turning back now.

102
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,079
Keep the ticket safe.

103
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,399
We'll cash it first thing tomorrow.

104
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:27,839
No problem.

105
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:28,680
But I don't have the ticket.

106
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,639
Zhenggui has it, right?

107
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:30,399
No?

108
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:31,920
We said it'd be safer with her.

109
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,279
You've piled up so many clothes unwashed?

110
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,000
I'll wash them, I will.

111
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:59,639
You must be tired from searching.

112
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:01,199
I'll make some midnight snacks.

113
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,720
Even simple instant noodles

114
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,879
deserve careful preparation.

115
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,600
Hui?

116
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,399
Am I sick?

117
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:20,879
Why do I feel like

118
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,240
her cooking doesn't appeal

119
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,720
to me right now?

120
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,639
Shh, don't let Nian'er hear.

121
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,679
Eat quickly before the noodles get soggy.

122
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,240
The tomatoes taste sweet and sour.

123
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,879
The noodles are springy - delicious!

124
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,919
Perfect.

125
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,000
Who said they had no appetite?

126
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:31,879
But it really is tasty.

127
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,480
Feels like all tonight's fatigue

128
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,399
has disappeared.

129
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:52,200
I was thinking,

130
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:56,720
how could that lottery ticket

131
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,840
just vanish like that?

132
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,799
It must still be in this room.

133
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:01,759
After eating,

134
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:02,720
let's search again.

135
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,679
Why wash clothes so late?

136
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:12,039
Afraid I'll forget tomorrow.

137
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:18,200
Clothes...

138
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,240
I know where the ticket is.

139
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:52,679
It's a bit wet.

140
00:15:57,879 --> 00:15:58,600
Hair dryer

141
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,279
No

142
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
The hot air will make the lottery ticket wrinkle

143
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,840
What should we do then?

144
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:06,519
How about putting it on a plate

145
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:07,879
and try freezing it in the fridge?

146
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,919
In this condition, can we still claim the prize?

147
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:36,399
Might as well try everything we can

148
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:47,960
Why do I feel we're not here to claim the prize

149
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,200
but to perform a show?

150
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,360
We're about to claim so much money

151
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,759
Of course we need to disguise ourselves

152
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:53,799
Just in case

153
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,080
You just secretly escort us

154
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,159
In case robbers show up

155
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,200
Why do I feel the three of us

156
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:17,640
look more like the robbers?

157
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,160
Cheers

158
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:38,000
Luckily Nian'er didn't actually call Cong Ge

159
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,119
She was just pretending

160
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:42,880
Nian'er's resignation was fake

161
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:45,039
But my leave is real

162
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:46,440
I was late this morning

163
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,480
Now I lost my half-year perfect attendance bonus

164
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:51,640
Li Yihan

165
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:54,559
He persuaded several senior employees to quit together

166
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:55,559
Said there's a company

167
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:57,799
willing to hire our team with high salaries

168
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,039
I refused

169
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,880
I'm loyal to my company

170
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,440
But I heard

171
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,319
that company offers million-dollar salaries

172
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:09,720
I really regret it now

173
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:12,160
Li Yihan

174
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,039
obviously isn't a good person

175
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,039
Maybe it's better not to go

176
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,759
It might look like a good opportunity

177
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:19,240
but could actually be a trap

178
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,440
True

179
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:28,839
We matched six red balls

180
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,400
Missed the blue one, but that's okay

181
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,079
Second prize is over 90,000 yuan

182
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,960
But the lottery staff

183
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,559
said our numbers are unreadable

184
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,640
The QR code won't scan

185
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,000
Absolutely refuses to pay us

186
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,240
Why is our luck always so bad?

187
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,279
Actually, this is my second time winning

188
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,200
How much did you win the first time?

189
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,839
What's wrong, classmate?

190
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:16,240
I need to take the civil service exam

191
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,160
I've been preparing for over half a year

192
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,039
But I'll be late in half an hour

193
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:19,839
Can't get a taxi no matter what

194
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:21,279
Where's the exam location?

195
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:21,960
Si Shi Qi Zhong High School

196
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,640
Get in, I'll take you there

197
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:27,880
Thank you

198
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,000
Ready to go?

199
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,519
Thanks to your help

200
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:32,599
I made it to the exam that day

201
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:35,039
Though I didn't pass in the end

202
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:36,720
I'm still very grateful to you

203
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,119
I left in such a hurry that day

204
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:40,279
Didn't even get your contact info

205
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,759
The funny thing is

206
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:44,359
recently I saw a movie's credits

207
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:45,519
with your name in it

208
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:48,480
I remembered you telling me your profession

209
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,480
So I tracked down that film company

210
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,519
Finally discovered

211
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:52,880
you live here

212
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,680
Thank you

213
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,279
for remembering me after all this time

214
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:59,039
and actually finding me

215
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,880
Are you here in Jiangzhou for work?

216
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:09,480
I found a job in Jiangzhou

217
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,519
Don't really want to go back home

218
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:16,279
So... do you need a roommate?

219
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,480
Yes

220
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:54,880
Total is 30 yuan

221
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,920
How would you like to pay?

222
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:02,680
Sorry, insufficient balance

223
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:06,599
Try this one

224
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,039
Still won't scan

225
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,880
I'm here traveling

226
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:21,400
Probably spent too much these days

227
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,880
Haven't even asked my family for money yet

228
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,640
Oh

229
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:30,039
Then... that coffee

230
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,240
still needs to be paid for

231
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,000
This is a painting I made.

232
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,359
It could sell for a hundred or two online.

233
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,599
Please take it.

234
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:45,839
Thirty yuan for the coffee.

235
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,680
And one-eighty as your tip.

236
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,240
Thirty plus one-eighty makes two-ten.

237
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:55,079
Not bad.

238
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,559
Excuse me...

239
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:59,000
We don't have that policy here.

240
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,039
Nian'er.

241
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:07,160
This customer wants to pay with a painting.

242
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:14,720
It's fine, the café belongs to our company.

243
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,839
Put it on my tab.

244
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,440
It's your first day.

245
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:19,079
Don't let it ruin your mood.

246
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:21,440
Wait.

247
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,880
Let's exchange contacts.

248
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,960
I'll pay you back tenfold later.

249
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,200
Ten times?

250
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:34,599
A hundred's fine too.

251
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:51,119
Hui.

252
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:52,440
My Precious.

253
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,200
Missed you so much.

254
00:22:59,200 --> 00:22:59,920
It's you.

255
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,400
Nian'er, show me the lease.

256
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,720
Huh?

257
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:13,640
Even sisters keep clear accounts.

258
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:19,559
Actually she secretly...

259
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:21,440
Took down the landlord's number.

260
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:23,200
Used her last savings...

261
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,680
To pay three months' rent for us three.

262
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:29,160
I'll show you later.

263
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:42,200
I want the biggest room.

264
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,400
If you don't mind.

265
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:45,319
Don't mind.

266
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:50,599
Oh right, I sleepwalk sometimes.

267
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:53,480
Help me with my bags.

268
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:18,599
In this world...

269
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:21,680
Only she calls me "My Precious."

270
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:23,000
My Precious.

271
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:25,680
But Nian'er, you never told us...

272
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,839
What you actually won the first time.

273
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,240
You two...

274
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:40,759
To lottery tickets.

275
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,799
To dinner.

276
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,799
To us three.

277
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:17,920
One two three four five six seven eight nine ten.

278
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,200
Life is like a grand lottery.

279
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:43,279
Good friends are your winning tickets.

280
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,440
Laughing with you in joy.

281
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:50,200
Comforting you in sorrow.

282
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,039
Facing hardships together.

283
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:56,000
Makes burdens feel lighter.

284
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,880
Supporting each other...

285
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,359
Turns all bitterness sweet.

286
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,240
And multiplies every happiness.

287
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,359
A little joy...

288
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,039
Becomes great delight.

289
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:09,960
They're the ones...

290
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,039
Who make ordinary days...

291
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,200
Vibrant and colorful.

292
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,920
I have a great idea.

293
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:37,279
What crazy scheme now?

294
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,119
Stop stop stop!

295
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:43,319
Let's sleep on the floor again.

296
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:47,839
Ah, please, I beg you!

297
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,200
Please please please!

298
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,440
I'm begging you!
