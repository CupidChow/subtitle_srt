1
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,519
Morning

2
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,159
Eat quickly while it's hot

3
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,400
Liang Nian'er

4
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:23,400
Cong, what's up?

5
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,400
Are you okay?

6
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,759
Boss Zhang is here with that streamer

7
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:27,080
They're already downstairs

8
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,960
Hurry up

9
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,960
Turn on your lights

10
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,280
and all the equipment

11
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,120
We need to impress the client

12
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:33,520
It's all on you

13
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:36,599
Always making me work overtime

14
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,919
Without overtime pay

15
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,520
Hired me and fired three others

16
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,400
Manager Li, may we come in?

17
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,560
Oh! Director Zhang!

18
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,240
Come in, come in

19
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,599
Let me introduce everyone

20
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,919
This is our golden sound engineer

21
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:00,759
Liang Nian'er

22
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,680
This is Director Zhang, famous agent from Tianhao Culture

23
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,719
Now let me proudly introduce

24
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:09,919
The rising star, Li Zhenggui

25
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,959
We'll trouble Teacher Liang with Zhen's audition tonight

26
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:28,279
We're counting on you

27
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,519
Hao, this studio looks so shabby

28
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,480
Is the equipment even functional?

29
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,000
Zhen, this is the best studio in west district

30
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,720
They don't just do auditions

31
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,600
They've dubbed for many blockbusters

32
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:46,199
This?

33
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,120
Can we start working now?

34
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,079
Go ahead

35
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:06,120
Let's begin, let's go

36
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,199
Brother Hao

37
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,079
This sound engineer looks silly

38
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,519
Is she competent?

39
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:17,959
People who look silly

40
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,360
in their professional field

41
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,480
can become unstoppable when passionate

42
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,240
Alright alright, let's begin

43
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:33,839
Why isn't dinner here yet?

44
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:35,079
I'm starving

45
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:37,279
Wonder what we're having tonight

46
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,079
If only I could cook like Teacher Liang

47
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:40,120
that would be great

48
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,800
Wouldn't have to eat work meals

49
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,680
or order takeout every day

50
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,279
Teacher Liang still working?

51
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:44,839
Nope

52
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:46,879
You wouldn't believe today's client

53
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,120
Zhang Haonan from Tianhao Group, you know him?

54
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,800
I know

55
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,399
He brought a young artist today

56
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,120
Named Li Zhenggui

57
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,800
I heard Teacher Liang in the studio

58
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,519
clashed with that Li Zhenggui

59
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,920
Come, have a seat

60
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:00,319
Have some water

61
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,279
We'll do a calibration test now

62
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,680
I'll count down from three

63
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,639
Please say into the microphone

64
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,199
"testing" three times

65
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:08,639
Three, two, one

66
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,439
Testing

67
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:13,120
Three times, please

68
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,839
Testing testing testing

69
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,319
Good, ready, begin

70
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:28,920
I came early, no time to hesitate

71
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,439
Facing all these plot twists

72
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:37,879
Vague, uncertain judgments of truth

73
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:39,639
Yet through companionship

74
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:44,720
Every dinner leaves more than just regrets

75
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:49,600
Sunshine still spreads its warmth

76
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,160
Will this work?

77
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,079
Don't worry

78
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:26,680
I came early, no time to dodge and hide

79
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,560
Facing all these plot twists

80
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,839
Vague and unclear, blurring true judgment

81
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,000
But we have each other's company

82
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,600
Every dinner together

83
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,120
Teacher Liang's professional skills

84
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,279
Are truly impressive

85
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,160
Director Zhang, let's step outside

86
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,199
To discuss future schedules

87
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,639
Let's go

88
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:52,199
Sunshine as usual, spreading warmth

89
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,959
That Li Zhenggui

90
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:59,360
First met Zhang Haonan at a bar

91
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,519
Next day he promised to make her famous

92
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,199
And now

93
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,959
He brought her to our studio today

94
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,000
That Director Zhang

95
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,959
Promises fame to too many artists

96
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,759
Never thought Teacher Liang would explode

97
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,399
She's fierce when angry

98
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:15,000
What delicious food did you order?

99
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:19,439
Director Zhang ordered extra for Teacher Liang

100
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,079
I think

101
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:22,360
Teacher Liang must be hungry now

102
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,319
I'll deliver it to her

103
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,279
So envious

104
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,519
Li Zhenggui's singing is just

105
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,240
When the mix came out

106
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:35,279
Even shocked Zhang Haonan

107
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:43,320
Brother Cong

108
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,480
Will we get paid this month?

109
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,639
Don't count on Li Zhenggui

110
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:51,679
No worries, salaries are secured

111
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,519
No problems going forward

112
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,720
Because Zhang Haonan agreed

113
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,039
To sign a three-year contract

114
00:08:58,799 --> 00:08:59,600
Three years

115
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:00,679
Yes

116
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,799
Nian'er, you've done great

117
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,879
No raise in three years?

118
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,519
Getting one this month

119
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,919
Brother Cong, you're here too

120
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,159
Your dinner's in the office

121
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,240
I'll go eat first

122
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,080
I'm starving

123
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:22,600
Had dinner yet?

124
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,279
Not yet

125
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,240
Go prepare dinner for Nian'er

126
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:28,399
Young people should be observant

127
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:35,360
Teacher Liang

128
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:37,600
Here's your dinner

129
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,240
No thanks, I'll cook at home

130
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,000
Thank you

131
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,720
I touched it first

132
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,279
But I saw it first

133
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,919
Then every man you see is yours?

134
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,080
Touch ATM money and it's yours?

135
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,919
You!

136
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,519
Boss, please cut into pieces, thanks

137
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,919
I'm back

138
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,639
What's wrong?

139
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:41,480
Met a crazy woman at supermarket

140
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:43,919
Who's this crazy woman?

141
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,519
You didn't buy chicken?

142
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:50,720
She's back

143
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,399
Little Zhenzhen is back

144
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,200
So tired

145
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:03,639
This crazy woman took my chicken

146
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,919
How long will you two keep cold war?

147
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:10,480
I just wanted to do some chores

148
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,720
Did I bother you?

149
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,879
Just because of some chores

150
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:14,519
You've been cold for two days

151
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,200
Can't let Zhenggui do groceries

152
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,879
When she shops

153
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:19,279
Spends our food budget for days

154
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,279
All at once

155
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,639
I've been very thrifty!

156
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,039
Chef, when will you cook?

157
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:33,919
Baby is starving

158
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,720
Let me lie down

159
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,000
Preparing dinner

160
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,919
Need creativity like an artist

161
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,320
And balance like a diplomat

162
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,159
Catering to all tastes

163
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,480
One more important thing

164
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,039
Speed

165
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:11,759
After all

166
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:15,039
Those two on sofa are starving

167
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,440
Tonight's theme

168
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,600
Chicken

169
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,720
One chicken, two dishes

170
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:22,320
Big Plate Chicken, Steamed Chicken with Cordyceps Flower

171
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:24,360
Zhenggui loves spicy

172
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,679
Hui'er prefers mild

173
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,240
First make Steamed Chicken with Cordyceps Flower

174
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,480
Marinate chicken pieces

175
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:35,639
Two spoons of aromatic rice wine

176
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:37,480
Is my secret ingredient

177
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:44,720
Drizzle oil to lock in juices

178
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:53,080
Finally,

179
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,320
Spread fresh cordyceps flowers

180
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,919
Ready to steam

181
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,559
While steaming, perfect time to stir-fry

182
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,039
This is time management

183
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:07,960
Potatoes, diced

184
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:10,279
Rinse off surface starch

185
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,840
Essential side dishes, all chopped

186
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,480
First, caramelize sugar

187
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,440
Caramel gives chicken appealing color

188
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,039
This step can't be skipped

189
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:53,639
That's the sound!

190
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:57,799
Various spices and seasonings

191
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,200
Add one by one

192
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,039
Doubanjiang is a must

193
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,320
Zhenggui's favorite

194
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:39,960
Pour in beer

195
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,879
Hops aroma enhances chicken's sweetness

196
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:50,679
Potatoes

197
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,720
Bell peppers

198
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:56,000
Piyazi

199
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,399
Oh, means onion

200
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,840
All into the pot!

201
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:02,440
Stir-fry

202
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,200
Coat all ingredients evenly with sauce

203
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,720
Cover and simmer

204
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,240
During this time

205
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,120
Can prepare the third dish

206
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:22,720
Uncover and serve

207
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:29,519
Finally, asparagus and mushrooms

208
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,080
Quick-cooking items last

209
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:34,840
This way when serving

210
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,039
All dishes will be piping hot

211
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,080
Nothing beats

212
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,399
a warm dinner

213
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,840
to relieve daily fatigue

214
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,000
Dinner's ready, family!

215
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:22,359
Spicy for you

216
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:23,759
Mild for you

217
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:26,000
As for me, everything!

218
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,759
Let's eat!

219
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:38,920
Wait, hold on

220
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,759
First, today we celebrate

221
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,119
Nian'er got a raise!

222
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:00,119
Wait a minute

223
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,599
How do you know about her raise?

224
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,319
Shh, explain later

225
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,759
To dinner!

226
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:13,160
Dig in!

227
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,319
Delicious!

228
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,920
Try these amazing potatoes

229
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:00,480
Are they spicy?

230
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,319
Hit me if too spicy

231
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:07,359
Eat

232
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:14,880
I want rice

233
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:12,000
Cheers!

234
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,599
How is it, Zhenzhen?

235
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,440
Pretty good

236
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,680
Wait a sec

237
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:28,680
Why keep calling her Zhenzhen?

238
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,079
I went to her company today

239
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,839
But you hate going out

240
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:38,839
Can't stand her boss

241
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,480
Cutting staff

242
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:44,160
Always overworking Nian'er

243
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,680
No overtime pay

244
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:48,400
That Zhang Haonan

245
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,480
Not bothering you?

246
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,559
I'm not stupid

247
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,200
Blocked him long ago

248
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:53,119
But your visit

249
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,680
Might affect her work

250
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,559
Thanks to her

251
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,799
I did get a raise today

252
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:04,079
No no, you two

253
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,480
Stop speaking in code

254
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,400
Just tell the truth

255
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:12,880
Here's the thing

256
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,960
You two were fighting

257
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,039
About grocery budget

258
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,799
100 yuan/day isn't enough

259
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:23,680
The real problem is

260
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,240
Our incomes are too low

261
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:28,000
Especially me

262
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,279
No raise in 3 years

263
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,079
Constant overtime

264
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:33,279
Without extra pay

265
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,240
Zhenggui wanted

266
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,359
To solve this fundamentally

267
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,680
Hence today's visit

268
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,480
To my company

269
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,079
No matter what happens

270
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:57,680
By evening

271
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,759
We deserve a perfect dinner

272
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,680
To dinner!

273
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,079
I want to wish

274
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,480
Wait, let me finish first

275
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,839
I wish for world peace

276
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,079
Wish us pay raises and great fortune

277
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,839
Good health for all of us

278
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,680
And ever-improving appetites

279
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:26,079
Also wish for smooth bowel movements

280
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,960
We're still eating dinner

281
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,759
Are you having trouble with that?

282
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:31,839
I'm perfectly regular

283
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:36,680
Let me show you something

284
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:48,119
I learned this from a livestream

285
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:55,839
Not bad

286
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:57,480
Join me

287
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:00,480
Slow down, don't fall

288
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,200
Wait

289
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:12,920
Shh

290
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:13,920
My mom

291
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:19,000
Hello, Mom

292
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:24,359
What's up calling so late?

293
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,599
Okay, no problem

294
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:31,079
See you in a couple days

295
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:32,400
Bye

296
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,839
Why did your mom call so late?

297
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:37,759
My parents found out about

298
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:40,279
my engagement to Wang Runze

299
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,720
So now they're rushing

300
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,440
to come see for themselves

301
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,480
It's fine, it's fine

302
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,279
Basically in a couple days

303
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,079
our moms will come over for dinner

304
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:53,400
And we'll all be there

305
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,079
Just bring that person too

306
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,559
Aren't you two broken up?

307
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,279
Yeah

308
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,079
Oh, never mind

309
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,480
We'll deal with that tomorrow

310
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,880
Almost forgot something

311
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,559
Her, Zhang Hui

312
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,519
Her parents hoped she'd grow up

313
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:34,480
to be virtuous and kind

314
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,680
so she could marry well

315
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,400
But things didn't go as planned

316
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,279
She had a tall, handsome boyfriend

317
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:41,839
They were nearly engaged

318
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:44,240
But broke up two weeks ago

319
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,839
Let me add

320
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,559
Zhang Hui works as a trainer
at a foreign company

321
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,079
Not sure how that's going

322
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:52,039
Probably like

323
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:52,839
this

324
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,839
One two three four

325
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:56,960
This way

326
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:01,480
Her, Li Zhenggui, from Chongqing

327
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,839
Childhood friends with Zhang Hui

328
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,240
Except for today

329
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,480
Every time I see her

330
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,039
she's either lying in bed or on the floor

331
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,240
or sprawled on the sofa

332
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,480
I suspect she's a spoiled rich kid

333
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,680
slumming it with us mortals

334
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,480
Mom, when can you transfer money?

335
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,160
I can't even buy things now

336
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,240
It's embarrassing

337
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:19,319
Hello?

338
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,200
Welcome everyone, remember to eat dinner!
