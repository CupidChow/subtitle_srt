1
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,759
Take a look.

2
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,680
This is Nian'er Private Kitchen's
menu for the first week.

3
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,479
I've prepared eight set menus in total.

4
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,199
Meat and veggies are balanced.

5
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:41,280
There are also all-vegetarian options.

6
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,520
It can meet different customers' needs.

7
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,879
No way.

8
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,479
Eight types put too much pressure
on storage.

9
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,879
You need to prioritize cost.

10
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,759
But if you reduce the variety,

11
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:52,039
there will be fewer choices.

12
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,599
Naturally, customers will decrease.

13
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:55,240
That also affects inventory.

14
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,280
Then I'll buy some advertising.

15
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,280
And run a promotion.

16
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,520
You can refine the dishes more.

17
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,280
Was my tone too harsh just now?

18
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,000
I...

19
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,719
No.

20
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:19,479
Sorry.

21
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:20,360
Just replying to a message.

22
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:20,840
It's fine.

23
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:49,360
Okay.

24
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,919
Why don't you take a look?

25
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,080
Is there anything else to discuss?

26
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,159
Not for now.

27
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,039
Alright.

28
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:57,639
Then these application documents,

29
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:58,680
I'll organize them again.

30
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,159
I'll submit them to the office
after the holiday.

31
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:01,080
Okay.

32
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,800
When you're done, just leave them
on the table.

33
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,960
I need to go to the supermarket first.

34
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,560
Otherwise, I won't have time
to make dinner.

35
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:09,439
Alright.

36
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,879
Thanks for your hard work.

37
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,240
No problem.

38
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,319
Why are you back?

39
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,959
I missed you.

40
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:34,079
Your hair's even straight now.

41
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:36,319
Nian'er.

42
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:38,759
I...

43
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,959
Let's talk at home.

44
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,480
What do you want to eat today?

45
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,279
I'll cook for you.

46
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,000
How did you know I was here?

47
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:55,519
Didn't you install a tracking app

48
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:57,560
on my phone to find it before?

49
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:58,959
Do you still lose your phone now?

50
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,759
Not often.

51
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,120
Just occasionally.

52
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,199
A little.

53
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,759
The ones you like.

54
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:10,680
Over there.

55
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,319
Okay.

56
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,480
I really like that one.

57
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,600
This one.

58
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:24,879
Don't eat that.

59
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:25,680
Seaweed.

60
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:40,519
Welcome home.

61
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,879
Don't mess around.

62
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:58,759
So nice.

63
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,319
Ah.

64
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,959
What's wrong?

65
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,920
Why are you here?

66
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,000
I just used the bathroom.

67
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,879
I was about to leave.

68
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:18,800
You were inside

69
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,399
and didn't make a sound.

70
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,959
I was just about to come out
and say hi.

71
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,120
You're leaving now, right?

72
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,439
Yes, yes.

73
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:27,399
I'm leaving now.

74
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,879
We meet again.

75
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:31,600
See you.

76
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,160
If I'd known someone was home,

77
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:47,519
I wouldn't have been a third wheel.

78
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:48,920
You misunderstood.

79
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,720
Are you two dating now?

80
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,319
No.

81
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:03,160
Yin Zhanqi is a very practical guy.

82
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,639
He pursues me just because he thinks

83
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,879
I'm a suitable candidate for marriage.

84
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:09,120
But that's not what I want.

85
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:12,920
Then why is he at your place?

86
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,160
We're discussing opening
the private kitchen.

87
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,399
Didn't I tell you all before?

88
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:19,120
Alright.

89
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,879
Stop bothering me while I cook.

90
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,720
Go play.

91
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,840
Too bad Hui isn't here.

92
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,799
First, stir-fry something simple
and tasty—

93
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,279
Chili fried pork.

94
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,279
Today's spiral peppers are so fresh.

95
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,320
Second dish—

96
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,519
Tomato vermicelli bass fillet.

97
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:02,879
Diced tomatoes.

98
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,200
Add two spoons of tomato sauce
and stir well.

99
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,879
Add some water.

100
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,039
Marinated bass fillet.

101
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:29,320
Put it in the pot and cook briefly.

102
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:37,919
Meanwhile,

103
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:39,720
make Cantonese sausage rice.

104
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,440
Last dish—

105
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,960
Garlic clam vermicelli casserole.

106
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,000
Zhenggui.

107
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,960
Come help me out.

108
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,879
Zhenggui.

109
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,279
Li Zhenggui.

110
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,799
Zhenggui.

111
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:11,360
What did you do?

112
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:12,440
What?

113
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,840
I tidied everything up.

114
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,279
You start causing chaos
as soon as you're back, huh?

115
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,039
I'm not used to it.

116
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:19,320
Messy is my style.

117
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,879
Don't you think it's more lively
this way?

118
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:24,399
Hurry up and come out.

119
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,200
I'm coming, I'm coming.

120
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,519
Here I am.

121
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:32,720
You...

122
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Come in first, come in.

123
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,039
The suitcase.

124
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:37,720
I'll take it.

125
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,519
Alright.

126
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:53,080
Have some hot water.

127
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,279
Didn't you say you'd come
the day after tomorrow?

128
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,480
Why did you come today?

129
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,279
And you didn't even tell me.

130
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,000
I could've picked you up
at the station.

131
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,519
I just missed you.

132
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,279
Wanted to surprise you.

133
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,279
What about you?

134
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:09,720
Why did you come back too?

135
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,879
Don't move.

136
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:11,799
It's fine.

137
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,879
Can you feel it?

138
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:21,919
The baby is kicking you.

139
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:24,919
It's all your fault.

140
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,480
You disturbed the baby's rest.

141
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,240
No.

142
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,080
The baby is greeting me.

143
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:33,159
Hui

144
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:35,120
Isn't your contract signing the day after tomorrow?

145
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,480
It's already signed.

146
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:37,279
Signed.

147
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:39,080
What contract?

148
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:41,879
I turned my years of experience

149
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:43,559
into online courses and posted them.

150
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:44,759
The results are pretty good.

151
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:47,360
So an MCN company reached out to me.

152
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,000
They want to discuss a partnership.

153
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,159
Congratulations.

154
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,320
Hello, Mr. Wang.

155
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,639
Ms. Zhang.

156
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,360
Please, have a seat. Please sit.

157
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:02,919
I didn't know you were pregnant.

158
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:04,600
And I made you come all this way.

159
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,600
I'm really sorry about that.

160
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,919
Mr. Wang, you're too polite.

161
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:08,679
How many months?

162
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,679
Over six months.

163
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:11,679
Congratulations.

164
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:12,919
Ms. Zhang.

165
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,279
You're pregnant,

166
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,080
yet you still teach so well.

167
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,799
I'm impressed.

168
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:17,559
Mr. Wang.

169
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:18,600
The course material

170
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,080
I'm very familiar with it.

171
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,279
I can record and edit all by myself.

172
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:24,080
You really are capable.

173
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,480
Do you want to rest first?

174
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,039
No need.

175
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:27,840
We can talk about the contract now.

176
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,519
Alright.

177
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,600
This is the contract based on our previous plan.

178
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,559
Drafted contract.

179
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:33,679
See if anything needs to be changed.

180
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,159
Okay.

181
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,080
Sorry.

182
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,080
I'll step out to take a call.

183
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,720
Alright.

184
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,000
Mr. Wang.

185
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,120
I've finished reviewing the contract.

186
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,960
No issues.

187
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,159
Should I sign now?

188
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,519
Ms. Zhang.

189
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,399
I want to revise this contract.

190
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:03,279
Is there a problem?

191
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,039
Well...

192
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,519
That call just now

193
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:09,759
was from someone named Li Yihan.

194
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:16,720
I understand.

195
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:18,600
Ms. Zhang.

196
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:21,080
Your private life isn't our concern.

197
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,159
Young people,

198
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:24,080
having a rich love life is normal.

199
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,720
But,

200
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,759
if our company signs you,

201
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:30,919
if your private life gets exposed online,

202
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:33,360
our company will face huge risks.

203
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,240
Mr. Wang.

204
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:40,480
This child is my ex-boyfriend's.

205
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,720
We dated normally and broke up normally.

206
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,960
I found out I was pregnant after we broke up.

207
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,519
I want to have this child.

208
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:47,759
But I don't want to marry him.

209
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:48,759
It's that simple.

210
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:58,759
This is the agreement I signed with my ex.

211
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,279
He gave up custody voluntarily.

212
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,200
I understand your concerns, Mr. Wang.

213
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,400
If that's the case,

214
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,880
I hope we can work together in the future.

215
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:15,359
Ms. Zhang, wait.

216
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:19,359
I really admire you.

217
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:21,720
Let's sign this contract together.

218
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:29,640
Li Yihan is such a jerk.

219
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,160
He only does things that hurt others and himself.

220
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,720
No.

221
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:34,519
Then why did Mr. Wang

222
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:36,079
suddenly change his mind?

223
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:39,920
Maybe he thinks my image is good.

224
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:41,119
It could attract traffic.

225
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,519
You...

226
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,799
Didn't you say you wouldn't come back?

227
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,160
Why are you here for Nian'er during the holiday?

228
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,880
How are things at home?

229
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,279
Sales grew to 28%.

230
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:02,319
Profit margin rose to 41%.

231
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:05,799
Market share increased to 23%.

232
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:06,440
This...

233
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:10,200
is our company's performance this quarter.

234
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:15,480
I now officially announce

235
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,400
our company is out of trouble.

236
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,519
Our next step

237
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,920
is to go public in the US.

238
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,359
Great.

239
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,480
Li Zhenggui

240
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,559
Li Zhenggui, wake up.

241
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:36,599
Li Zhenggui

242
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,920
Li Zhenggui, wake up.

243
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,720
Mom.

244
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:46,519
I want to rebuild the company with you.

245
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,720
Rebuild what company?

246
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,200
The company has already closed.

247
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,440
Mom.

248
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,559
I've worked hard for so many years.

249
00:18:57,759 --> 00:18:59,000
I want to retire too.

250
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:01,000
And enjoy life.

251
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:05,880
My good daughter,

252
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:09,759
be sure to keep me company from now on.

253
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:12,200
We'll rely on each other, just mother and daughter.

254
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:18,160
But I want to care for you with Dad.

255
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,119
Don't mention him to me.

256
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:21,599
In this lifetime,

257
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,200
I never want to see him again.

258
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,359
All these years,

259
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,839
all those affairs and mistresses...

260
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:28,079
I've had enough.

261
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,480
Now,

262
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:30,880
I don't want to tolerate anything.

263
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,799
Anyway,

264
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:34,359
the assets he got

265
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,920
he can spend on whoever he wants.

266
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,519
Mom.

267
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:47,000
I'll work hard for sure.

268
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,079
So you can have a happy retirement.

269
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:51,319
Alright.

270
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:54,200
Silly child.

271
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,480
You...

272
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,920
As long as you can support yourself, that's enough.

273
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:00,920
My painting work now

274
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:02,039
is going pretty well.

275
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:02,680
Good.

276
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:06,519
Nice, Li Zhenggui.

277
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:08,400
You're on a roll now.

278
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:10,440
My work isn't really a roll.

279
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,200
But my picture book got a reprint.

280
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,720
That's great.

281
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,200
Congrats to you too.

282
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,759
I've figured it out.

283
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,319
I think success isn't the most important.

284
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:24,279
The most important is settling yourself.

285
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:28,079
Right now, dinner is most important.

286
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,119
I'll go get ready and start dinner.

287
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:57,400
I'm so glad you could come back today

288
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,920
and spend the Mid-Autumn Festival with me

289
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,680
It makes me truly happy

290
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,079
I feel like I am

291
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:05,519
the luckiest person in the world

292
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:44,160
A toast to dinner

293
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,319
A toast to dinner

294
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,200
What's wrong

295
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,880
Are you feeling unwell

296
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,079
Call someone

297
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:03,279
Li Zhenggui, make the call

298
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,119
Call who

299
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:07,680
Call 120

300
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:10,119
Can you walk

301
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:14,839
Go slowly

302
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,319
Li Zhenggui, your phone

303
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:44,279
You're all still here

304
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,799
Thank you all

305
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,960
for sharing so many sunsets and fireworks with me

306
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,680
Over the past year

307
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:59,319
I've been walking gently through life

308
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:01,119
in a life of sudden winds and rain

309
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,279
Life isn't just pure happiness

310
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,160
Joy always comes mixed

311
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,680
with anxiety and unease

312
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,519
We all brave the storms to make a living

313
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,079
I hope you all find peace

314
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:16,599
Yes

315
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:19,160
Hui and Li Zhenggui are both doing well

316
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:21,400
They're taking good care of themselves

317
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:23,400
You should remember to eat well too

318
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,880
I'll be somewhere in the world

319
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,319
having dinner with you

320
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,400
Goodbye, my friends

321
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:33,880
We'll meet again
