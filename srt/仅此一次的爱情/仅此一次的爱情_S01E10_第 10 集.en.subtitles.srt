1
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,402
You're here.

2
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:12,280
I'm sorry I'm late.

3
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,996
Are you all finished?

4
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,416
You won't leave again, will you?

5
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,295
Why won't you say anything?

6
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:29,714
Promise me.

7
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,061
I love you.

8
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:48,566
I love you.

9
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:50,860
Yeon-seo.

10
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,507
What? Why isn't he coming?

11
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,272
-Did you sleep well?
-You're late.

12
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:12,233
I told you to come within a minute
after I ring the bell.

13
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,490
Stand on the right. Give you my left arm.

14
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,159
Correct?

15
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,369
Not bad.

16
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,038
I will serve you with my best

17
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,623
as if this is my first time.

18
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,333
-Don't be so cheeky.
-Okay.

19
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:29,792
If you don't want me to, forget it.

20
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:37,550
I never said no.

21
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,305
You remember

22
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:45,016
what happened

23
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,310
last night?

24
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,912
You got your hopes up, didn't you?

25
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:12,794
Hey, Yeon-seo!

26
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:14,879
Don't let me catch you.

27
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,714
-You can't catch me.
-Stop running. You might fall.

28
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:17,632
If I catch--

29
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:22,303
If you catch me, then what?

30
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,473
What now? What will you do?

31
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,198
Dan?

32
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,454
Goodness! Ms. Jung!

33
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,581
Have you been well?

34
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,417
What happened?

35
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,043
Are you back for good?

36
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,670
Things must have been tough because of me.

37
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:56,754
I'm sorry.

38
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,174
You've done well until today.

39
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,551
You can start commuting as of today.

40
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,471
I knew it.

41
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:08,224
I thought I heard the door open,
so I called the security company

42
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,310
to take a look at the CCTV footage.

43
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,519
-No!
-No!

44
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,401
It was you, Dan.

45
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,326
Ms. Lee, it's about that friend.

46
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,786
Did the guy who wanted some time
come back to her?

47
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,121
What?

48
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,999
Oh, yes. Probably.

49
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,334
I'm not sure.

50
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:37,003
Tell her not to trust men so much.

51
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,671
A guy who changes his mind often

52
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,340
will definitely turn out to be a bad guy.

53
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,190
I did my best as I waited for you.

54
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,276
I ate well and practiced well too.

55
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,321
Good girl, Yeon-seo.

56
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:06,699
What were you up to?

57
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:10,203
Aren't you going to tell me?

58
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:14,457
Go inside.

59
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,921
So you're also a bad guy
who changes his mind often.

60
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:22,090
No way. I'm going to stay
by your side from now on.

61
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,425
I decided to do that
as I walked in yesterday.

62
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,637
It doesn't matter if you just stay
by my side.

63
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,263
Your heart might be somewhere else.

64
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,808
It's not a crime to love a lot,

65
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,935
but it is a crime
to have too many secrets.

66
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:36,604
-Who said that?
-Lee Yeon-seo.

67
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,356
She's a great person.

68
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,903
Do a great job,

69
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:45,446
great person.

70
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,418
Are you going to be her rib?

71
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:00,586
It's none of your business.

72
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,672
If I turn into dust or dissipate,

73
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:03,881
that's for me to deal with.

74
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,806
You'll be very lucky
if you just dissipate.

75
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:14,183
You can't even imagine
what the punishment is like.

76
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,518
Something horrifying

77
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,145
will happen.

78
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:18,813
How

79
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:20,898
do you know that?

80
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,402
There was a young angel

81
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,822
who thought he was special

82
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,323
just like you.

83
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,661
Her rib? Love?

84
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:36,956
You need to give up.
There won't be a happy ending.

85
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,291
One of you will

86
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,460
end up living a dreadful life.

87
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,670
So do not throw a stone

88
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,380
into the still water
to satisfy your desire.

89
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,298
Pretend like

90
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,633
you're a human, then disappear quietly.

91
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:51,679
Desire?

92
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:53,931
You might be right.

93
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:55,808
But

94
00:07:58,644 --> 00:07:59,854
I don't want to be a coward.

95
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:04,358
I want Yeon-seo to know who I am.

96
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,152
It doesn't matter if I'm a human or not,

97
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,196
or if I'm dead or alive.

98
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,781
I want her to know my present and my past,

99
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:12,408
and love me for who I am.

100
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,452
Do you not want that?

101
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,622
Don't you want to be

102
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:20,500
understood?

103
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,089
No, I don't need that.

104
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,259
The moment you tell her,
everything will be over.

105
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,471
Do as you please.

106
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:34,805
However,

107
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,683
keep your mouth shut until the audition--

108
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:38,935
I was going to do that anyway.

109
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,604
You're not the only one
who cares about her.

110
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,648
So don't try to give me

111
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:45,650
any advice.

112
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:56,619
By the way, about that angel...

113
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:02,833
Why do I feel like it's...

114
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,339
Never mind.

115
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,759
You're nothing but a foolish and weak

116
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:14,929
human being.

117
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,934
Ask your petty deity why I'm like this.

118
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,604
And whether it's Yeon-seo or Dan,

119
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,148
if the deity wants to ruin my plans again,

120
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:10,067
tell Him to wake up as well.

121
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:12,987
Ruin his plan again?

122
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,155
Living is already a torment.

123
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,282
Wishing to be born again
is a silly thought.

124
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:18,743
And wishing for peace on the other side

125
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,078
sounds lame, doesn't it?

126
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,387
THE LATE CHOI SEOL-HUI

127
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,490
Lower your shoulders. Okay, that's good.

128
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,723
Welcome.

129
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,272
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

130
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,024
-May I have a bottle of soju?
-Coming up.

131
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:36,946
-Here.
-Thank you.

132
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:04,223
HOUSEKEEPER JUNG YU-MI

133
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,225
Just give us a little more time.

134
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,810
You're a dad too.

135
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:10,104
You know how I feel, don't you?

136
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,199
Mr. Park.

137
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,411
I'm known for my persistence.

138
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:28,581
Would you like me to leave

139
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,916
80 missed calls?

140
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,010
Hello, Ms. Jung.

141
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:43,888
Are you sick?
What's wrong with your voice?

142
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,725
Don't tell me you've changed your mind.

143
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,560
No, that's not it.

144
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:53,105
If you don't meet me at 3 p.m. tomorrow,
I'll go to Fantasia myself.

145
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,190
Do you understand?

146
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,983
Don't sound so scary.

147
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,193
I didn't forget.

148
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,620
Do you know that Kim Dan

149
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,372
is giving up on his mission
and is about to cause a mess?

150
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,209
I don't care if your subordinate

151
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:16,545
turns into dust as punishment
for acting recklessly.

152
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,048
But I thought
you should at least know about it.

153
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,508
Do as you please.

154
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,927
Come sit down.

155
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,392
Let's have a drink.

156
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,562
Humans sometimes drink

157
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:35,689
instead of praying.

158
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:38,067
I have nothing more to say to you.

159
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,152
I did hear

160
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,363
about an abandoned angel

161
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,615
who had turned into a human.

162
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:55,793
"They reeled and staggered
like drunkards."

163
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:02,591
"And were at their wits' end."

164
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:05,427
You didn't forget it.

165
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,639
I'm tired of those verses,

166
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,767
but they just won't disappear
from my memory.

167
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,820
You must've gone through a lot.

168
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,115
You were left in this barren world,

169
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,034
not being able to live or die.

170
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,748
Are you saying that you understand me
as a merciful angel yourself?

171
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,625
Then what?

172
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,628
Did you expect me to kneel down
and repent my sins?

173
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,171
Dream on.

174
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,091
Just focus on managing
that junior of yours.

175
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,930
Why are you so hostile towards Dan?

176
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,473
You achieved your goal.

177
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,267
You successfully placed
that woman who looks like

178
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,518
your dead lover, Noisy Gong...

179
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:58,647
No, I mean Yeon-seo on stage.

180
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,232
You did it.

181
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,656
At first, I thought so too.

182
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,118
I thought she was the perfect key.

183
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,747
I thought it'd be over
once I put her up on stage.

184
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,831
However...

185
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,625
It might be an endless tunnel,

186
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,585
but it'll be easier together.

187
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,084
You want to live now.

188
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,129
You used to say
that living was pure torment.

189
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,299
I want to break free

190
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,470
from that torment.

191
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,165
LEE YEON-SEO, YOO SEONG-U

192
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:47,464
Yeon-seo, listen carefully
to what I'm about to tell you.

193
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,384
Do you know

194
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,096
what a guardian angel is?

195
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:57,641
No.

196
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:00,310
Don't be so surprised. I'll...

197
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,980
Darn it. Ji Kang-woo said that before.

198
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,481
So...

199
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,318
I was Seong-u.

200
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,237
I was him.

201
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,990
But after I died, I became an angel.

202
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,368
But I just happened to remember that.

203
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:19,121
What am I saying?

204
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,248
It makes no sense.

205
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,261
LADY YEON-SEO

206
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,596
"Lady Yeon-seo"?

207
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,852
-Hello?
-Come to the flower garden right now.

208
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:50,527
Sit down. It's chamomile tea.

209
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:52,237
"Lady Yeon-seo"?

210
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,198
You inserted that, didn't you?

211
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,326
You shouldn't use my phone
without my permission.

212
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,702
Why is it yours?

213
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,121
I bought it and gave it to you.

214
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,166
And what's wrong with the name?
It's much better than Noisy Gong.

215
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:08,253
"Lady Yeon-seo." Repeat after me.

216
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,258
"Lady Yeon-seo."

217
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,427
Why did you call me?

218
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:18,180
Do you have trouble sleeping?

219
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,814
Which one of these two is it?

220
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:30,275
Are you married?
Or do you have a terminal disease?

221
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,445
I've given it some thought.

222
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,614
I tried to figure out
what you're hiding from me

223
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,075
and what you need to figure out.

224
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:40,494
You're not supposed to like me,
but you ended up liking me.

225
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:41,870
Why does that break your heart?

226
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,039
What could it be?

227
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,958
It's either you're married or you're ill.

228
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,380
Come on. It's neither one.

229
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,675
You're the only one for me.

230
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,094
You're my first and last.

231
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:01,223
And I'm really healthy.

232
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,307
I'm not ill.

233
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:06,270
Then tell me what you've been up to
while you were away.

234
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:08,856
Where did you go?

235
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,359
I'll tell you everything
after the audition.

236
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:16,697
I don't want to bother you
for no good reason before your big day.

237
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:24,830
Dan, listen up.

238
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,457
If it's about you,

239
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,127
even a strand of your hair
is a good reason for me to care.

240
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:32,337
To me,

241
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,381
you're the most important.

242
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:36,675
Did you understand that?

243
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:42,723
Tell me.

244
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,058
I don't care whatever it is.

245
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,352
Really?

246
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:55,611
Actually,

247
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,073
I met

248
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,159
my dad.

249
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,163
Gosh.

250
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,042
I've never said that out loud before.

251
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,295
Your father

252
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:15,172
who kicked you out?

253
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,299
Did you ask for forgiveness

254
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,176
for your mistake?

255
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,471
Well,

256
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,890
it's a common, boring story.

257
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,645
I've completely forgotten about him
for over a decade of my life.

258
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,065
I barely managed to meet him
right before he died.

259
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,235
I asked him what I wanted to know

260
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,238
and said goodbye.

261
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:44,743
That's my story.

262
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,455
What did you

263
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,457
want to know from him?

264
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,417
Well,

265
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,172
I wondered why he was so harsh on me.

266
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,010
I was his son after all.

267
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,639
He should've loved me.

268
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:12,020
Things like that.

269
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:14,606
Did he

270
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,441
apologize to you?

271
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:21,780
Fortunately, yes.

272
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,452
All right. My storytime is over.

273
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:28,829
Wasn't that boring?

274
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,001
Come here.

275
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,670
No, I'm all right.

276
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:37,921
I've let things go.

277
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:45,262
You and me, both.

278
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,391
We're all alone in this world.

279
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,813
Good job,

280
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,356
Dan.

281
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,784
I'm all right.

282
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:10,996
I'm really fine.

283
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,189
When does your rehearsal end today?

284
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:38,690
Let me see. Around 6 p.m.

285
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,234
Darn it. I end around 3 p.m.

286
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,695
Hey, your outfit. Is that new?

287
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,572
What do you think? Isn't this pretty?

288
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:46,615
-It's pretty.
-What?

289
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,075
Are you teaching more classes?

290
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:49,951
Do you even have time for that?

291
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,497
By the way, did you two

292
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,957
meet with Associate Director Keum?

293
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:58,752
My gosh.

294
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,087
Did Associate Director Keum

295
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:02,130
contact you in private?

296
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:03,715
I don't know.

297
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,634
I only heard about it.

298
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,474
I'll cancel the audition
and publicly announce

299
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,351
that the General Director
and the Associate Director

300
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:15,602
bought votes from the corps

301
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:18,688
and tried to make their family member
Ni-na win the leading role.

302
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:20,649
I'll announce it to the association
and the media too.

303
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:22,776
Go ahead.

304
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:25,821
However, you have
neither witnesses nor evidence.

305
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,240
Be ready to take responsibility
for telling everyone

306
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:29,699
that Fantasia is in ruins.

307
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,619
Regardless of the result,
you tried to buy the votes.

308
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:33,870
I bet you can't deny that.

309
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,499
I only met with my dancers
in private as an associate director.

310
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,126
I asked if they needed help

311
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,419
or if they had any suggestions
for the ballet theater.

312
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,380
If you consider that as buying votes,

313
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,632
I'll take responsibility
and resign from Fantasia.

314
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:48,135
Your resignation won't
be enough to resolve this matter.

315
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,594
If the audition isn't executed fairly,

316
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,972
don't you know that we won't be able to
prepare the show properly?

317
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,891
What do you and General Director Choi

318
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:56,893
want from this ballet theater?

319
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:58,895
Is it truly about money?

320
00:23:58,979 --> 00:23:59,813
Director Ji.

321
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,401
You keep condemning
General Director Choi and me

322
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:06,820
as if we're the most
despicable people on Earth.

323
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:11,992
Let me give you a warning very politely.

324
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,035
Please refrain yourself

325
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,580
before my patience runs out.

326
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,002
We'll proceed
with the audition as planned.

327
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:24,337
Give me all of the evidence
that proves that we bought votes

328
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:25,839
with money or bribes.

329
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:29,134
After I look at the evidence myself,
I'll cancel the audition.

330
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,658
My goodness!

331
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:56,912
No one followed you here, right?

332
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,914
No. What about you?

333
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:01,291
You're acting like yourself,
so they don't suspect you, right?

334
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,585
Of course. No one knows. No one.

335
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,003
No one will know.

336
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:06,588
Good job.

337
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:07,839
Let's go in.

338
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:21,853
Who is this?

339
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:23,730
Ji-ung.

340
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,023
Mr. Park.

341
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,736
Where and how have you been
all these years? You never called!

342
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:33,281
After hearing from Ms. Jung,
I knew it would be you.

343
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,617
What do you mean?

344
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,911
You can catch up later.
Let's cut to the chase.

345
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:40,121
Ji-ung is going to testify for us.

346
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,499
-Testify what?
-The accident

347
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:44,459
that caused Ms. Lee to go blind.

348
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,586
That wasn't an accident. It's an incident.

349
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,838
Someone instigated the incident,
and it was totally planned.

350
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,173
What? What did you say?

351
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:51,508
Who?

352
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:57,764
Is it ready?

353
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,392
I'll do it since I'm instructed to do so.

354
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:02,310
But she really might die from it.

355
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,521
Right. That's the whole point.

356
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,440
If you fail, you know that
you have to give back

357
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,401
all the money we've given you, right?

358
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:11,903
Please.

359
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:13,029
Don't forget.

360
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:18,535
The ending of Act Two.

361
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,620
It's when Lee Yeon-seo's solo scene ends.

362
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,302
I knew it was wrong.

363
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:39,055
I shouldn't have done it
even if I was about to lose everything.

364
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:40,765
I think it was a trap.

365
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,059
You said your father never gambled.
Not once in his life.

366
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:45,979
But all of a sudden,
your father owes millions for gambling,

367
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:49,691
and then a stranger suddenly appears
and gives you money?

368
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,192
I bet it was all part of the plan.

369
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:52,944
Who? Who planned it?

370
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,446
We should look into that now.

371
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,365
After the audition tomorrow, I'll go
to the police station with Ms. Lee.

372
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,993
You must bring the recording file
and documents you told me about

373
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:01,786
by tomorrow, Mr. Park.

374
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:03,705
Okay.

375
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:20,513
UNTITLED
DOWNLOADING

376
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,851
We should look into that now.

377
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:27,604
After the audition tomorrow, I'll go
to the police station with Ms. Lee.

378
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:30,440
You must bring the recording file
and documents you told me about

379
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:32,150
by tomorrow, Mr. Park.

380
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:36,071
You shouldn't have tried anything.

381
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:40,116
If you had any conscience,
you wouldn't have done it, to begin with.

382
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,577
You're dying anyway.

383
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,996
So now you're suddenly scared of
going to hell?

384
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:18,780
I told you to stay still.

385
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:21,032
How can I stay still?
You said you're going to die after this.

386
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,368
-This is his last time.
-He should know better.

387
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:24,786
He deceived Giselle.

388
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,124
Because he deceived her,
she's going to die.

389
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,875
How dare he hold her hand?

390
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,669
He didn't know that would happen.

391
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,004
He feels bad, so he wants
to atone for what he did.

392
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,423
That's no use.

393
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:39,634
Can you just kill everyone
like Director Ji's interpretation?

394
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:40,677
That's more intense.

395
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,638
You really have to win tomorrow.

396
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,140
And don't forget.

397
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,475
At 5 p.m. tomorrow--

398
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,893
How many times do you have to tell me?

399
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:50,895
The party at the cafe
in front of the police station.

400
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,897
You can celebrate or comfort me.
Do whatever you want.

401
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:56,025
Things will get very hectic
after tomorrow.

402
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,819
-Be ready.
-Okay.

403
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,076
One more time.

404
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,995
You've been doing this for three hours.

405
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:08,747
It's because something is
still bothering me.

406
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,123
I'm still in love,

407
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,916
but I know he deceived me.

408
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:13,460
I don't know what to do.

409
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,674
REPORT

410
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:25,847
Are you asleep?

411
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,559
No. Why?

412
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:36,816
Do you want to
help me practice a bit more?

413
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:38,026
What?

414
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:39,736
Come here.

415
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,780
I told you. I have to practice.

416
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,114
You don't need to do that.

417
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,450
Let's forget everything
and get some fresh air.

418
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,619
What do you want to see?

419
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,913
The river, the sea, trees, fields,
tell me anything you want.

420
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,831
I'll take you there. Okay?

421
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,211
Stars.

422
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,881
I want to see the stars with you.

423
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:57,772
He must have had a reason.

424
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:00,567
What?

425
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:05,572
He truly loved Giselle too, didn't he?

426
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:10,201
Maybe the first engagement
was made against his will.

427
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:14,247
That's probably why
he ran away to the countryside.

428
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:17,166
Keep going.

429
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,548
He ended up in a strange place,
met a woman,

430
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:26,092
and fell in love with her.

431
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,137
He shouldn't have fallen in love with her,

432
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,764
but no matter how hard he tried,

433
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,225
he couldn't help but fall in love.

434
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:39,397
He probably made a decision

435
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:41,566
to abandon everything

436
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:43,359
and live there.

437
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:46,821
Then he should have told her earlier.

438
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:51,701
He probably wanted to.

439
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,746
But he put it off for a day

440
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,040
and another day.

441
00:31:58,958 --> 00:31:59,792
Probably.

442
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:02,962
Was he afraid she'd leave
if he told her the truth?

443
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,174
He was probably afraid.

444
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:07,675
He didn't trust her.

445
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:11,930
The man

446
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:15,892
trusted his love, but not Giselle's love.

447
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:21,022
She's a woman who loved him
even after she became a spirit.

448
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:24,901
That's heartrending.

449
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:29,572
Let's go. I need to dance this out.

450
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,366
Right now?

451
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:33,993
I need to try it out
when I have the feeling. Let's go.

452
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:05,233
I need to talk to--

453
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,695
Goodness.

454
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:13,408
Why did you come here?

455
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,411
Where is your handkerchief?

456
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:18,663
It's mine,

457
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:19,998
so I'll manage that.

458
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,878
There's no use in threatening me.
I already made my decision.

459
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,422
No, you need to turn back.

460
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:28,715
Ji Kang-woo is...

461
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:31,426
You already know he only wanted her
because she looks like his first love.

462
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,677
He was sincere.

463
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,472
He is sincerely in love with Yeon-seo.

464
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:43,312
That can't be right.

465
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:46,607
Your mission is halfway to success.
You just have to leave now.

466
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,403
If you're here to tell me that, just go.

467
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:54,198
So what if you tell your story
to Noisy Gong?

468
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:55,283
Then what?

469
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:58,911
Then are you going to show her
how you turn into dust?

470
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:19,432
The best thing that you can do for her
is to leave her side now

471
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,184
before she loves you even more,

472
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:23,019
before she gets more deeply hurt,

473
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:25,271
and before something
more frightening happens.

474
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,899
Ji Kang-woo can be there
by Noisy Gong's side.

475
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,651
You and I can return to paradise.

476
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,988
That's a happy ending for everyone.

477
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,574
Isn't that right, Dan?

478
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:43,164
I'm sure there is a way.

479
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,958
If a human can become an angel,

480
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:47,919
an angel could become a human too.

481
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,629
Stop talking nonsense!

482
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:51,047
Make a wise decision.

483
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:53,091
If you act rashly,
something bad will happen.

484
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,884
Stop trying to scare me!

485
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:58,179
I'll deal with the bad thing
and get struck by lightning if I must.

486
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:00,014
Go.

487
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:02,308
Dan...

488
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,152
Don't be nervous.

489
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:16,656
You're the one who'll be dancing,
but why am I so nervous?

490
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:18,324
You can do it, Noisy Gong.

491
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:20,493
That again.

492
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,998
You're my Noisy Gong,
the prettiest one in this world.

493
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,210
Here.

494
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:38,928
This certifies your identity as an angel,

495
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,556
and it connects the earth with the sky,

496
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,808
so you cannot lose it.

497
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:46,102
Make sure you always keep it with you.

498
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:50,356
May I borrow that until today?
I want it as my good luck charm.

499
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,162
This is yours now.

500
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,248
Are you going to give it to me for good?

501
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:09,834
I don't need this

502
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,794
because I'll be here with you.

503
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:34,358
Your vote today

504
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,861
will determine the future of Fantasia.

505
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:41,032
I believe that you will vote for a dancer
who touches your heart.

506
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,059
Keum Ni-na didn't come?

507
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,440
Good luck, everyone.

508
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:16,525
San-ha, control your emotions.

509
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:17,985
Su-ji, get bolder.

510
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,528
Jeong-eun, maintain your balance.

511
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:20,696
And Yeon-seo...

512
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,203
Focus on your interpretation.

513
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:28,996
Whoever it may be,

514
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,457
I'm going to do my best
to use their interpretation.

515
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,168
So do your best to convince them

516
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,671
so that the corps and I
will be able to follow.

517
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:55,398
Just give up.

518
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,445
You overworked yourself
after giving birth, right?

519
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,364
It seems like there's an inflammation
in your pelvis.

520
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:05,241
Have you gone to the hospital?

521
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:06,325
What is it?

522
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:08,452
Are you desperate to gain my vote?

523
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,747
You don't consider me a rival, do you?

524
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,291
Are you going to stop being a ballerina?

525
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,419
Did you go through all that
and make a comeback just for this?

526
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:19,422
Give up on this audition
and focus on getting better first.

527
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:21,966
No.

528
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:23,092
I can't do that.

529
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:24,802
I will never give up again.

530
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:28,014
If I give up,
it'll be too difficult to return.

531
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:31,475
I'm sure you, of all people, would know.

532
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,312
I may be nothing in your eyes,

533
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:35,896
but I am still a ballerina.

534
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,897
Do you know that?

535
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,824
We will now begin the audition.

536
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:50,536
The candidates were allowed
to choose any scenes from Giselle.

537
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,913
The first candidate is Lee San-ha.

538
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,719
If we win over 30 members
of the corps and 13 from our side,

539
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:07,887
will that make us safe?

540
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,890
Since the voting will be done in secret,
we won't be able to track them.

541
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,434
We can't be sure. I don't like this idea.

542
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,856
If we meet them in person,
it'll only leave traces.

543
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:20,066
I know that.

544
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,110
But there's no other way.

545
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:27,031
Yeon-seo is second to none
when it comes to performing ballet.

546
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:30,284
She's aware of that, and that is why
she has put everything on the line.

547
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:37,541
I'm sure the corps will give back
for what they've received.

548
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,127
Ni-na needs to do well.

549
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,755
As an artist, I'm sure she has her pride.

550
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:44,382
They need money after all.

551
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:45,800
In life,

552
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,636
money is the most important.

553
00:39:57,853 --> 00:40:00,606
Next up is Keum Ni-na.

554
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,712
Keum Ni-na just arrived.

555
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,593
She has a completely different vibe.

556
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:45,568
I told you to stop crying.

557
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:47,570
What is this disgusting emotion?

558
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,530
I can't stop myself.

559
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,490
What use is all of this?

560
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:54,660
It has to be Yeon-seo.

561
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:57,246
I can never be

562
00:40:58,038 --> 00:41:00,124
as competent as she is.

563
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:01,917
Did you just realize that?

564
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:04,253
This was your fate from the beginning.

565
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:07,089
You're like an item on display that
nobody wants no matter how pretty you are.

566
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:08,549
Unless you're Yeon-seo,

567
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,885
you have no choice but
to be locked up behind glass doors.

568
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:12,595
Forget it!

569
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:14,722
Why do you even bother to try?

570
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:27,568
1,124. 1,125. 1,120...

571
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:33,949
She did it.

572
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:09,128
That was incredible.

573
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:10,588
You were breathtaking.

574
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:13,257
Don't evaluate me.

575
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:15,467
I didn't do that to gain your approval.

576
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:17,553
Mind your own business.

577
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:23,350
Next up is Lee Yeon-seo.

578
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:24,995
She feels resentment.

579
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:27,122
Not towards him,

580
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,083
but towards herself.

581
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,294
Was my love not enough?

582
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:42,638
It's not like that.

583
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,392
He probably couldn't tell me

584
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:48,727
because he didn't trust me.

585
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:52,773
No, I do want to tell you.

586
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:55,025
I want to tell you the most.

587
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:59,571
I want to tell you who and what I am.

588
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:03,659
But should I?

589
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:58,482
I will now tally the votes.

590
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:01,777
1: LEE SAN-HA, 2: LEE SU-JI
3: HWANG JEONG-EUN

591
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,904
4: KEUM NI-NA
5: LEE YEON-SEO

592
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,660
BALLOT BOX

593
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:11,954
The last vote goes to...

594
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:25,842
Lee Yeon-seo.

595
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:33,392
4: KEUM NI-NA
5: LEE YEON-SEO

596
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:35,435
Since it's tied,

597
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:38,814
we can either have a final round
or a head-to-head vote.

598
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:41,275
But why are there only 29 votes?

599
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:46,196
Did one of you abstain?

600
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:49,157
Where did Ms. Hwang Jeong-eun go?

601
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,827
She said something urgent
came up, so she left.

602
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:55,163
It looks like she didn't vote.

603
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:56,415
Let's call her and ask.

604
00:47:57,082 --> 00:47:59,042
She left in a hurry,
but she saw the performances.

605
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:01,169
And I bet she has no idea about the tie.

606
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:04,798
We can just call her and ask her
who she wants to vote for.

607
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:06,758
Including the candidates and the voters,

608
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:08,969
if anyone is against this idea,

609
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:11,263
we'll push forward
with a head-to-head vote.

610
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:16,310
None, right?

611
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:18,854
You know that Korea is known for
its competitiveness.

612
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:21,189
We can't end the audition
without a clear winner.

613
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:23,400
Go ahead and call her.

614
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,702
DIRECTOR JI KANG-WOO

615
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:39,374
Hello?

616
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:41,960
Jeong-eun, you saw the performances,
right?

617
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:43,545
I won't drag this out.

618
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:45,631
You'll vote on the phone.

619
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:48,508
Among the five candidates, cast your vote.

620
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:50,719
Now? On the phone?

621
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:51,845
Yes.

622
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,889
Everyone is listening to the phone call.

623
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:56,183
However, if this is too much for you,
you don't have to do it.

624
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:57,809
This is supposed to be anonymous,

625
00:48:57,893 --> 00:48:59,519
but everyone will find out
who you voted for.

626
00:48:59,936 --> 00:49:01,855
-If you want to abstain--
-No, I'll vote.

627
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:04,691
If you'll count my vote, I'll vote.

628
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:09,988
I...

629
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:19,373
liked Lee Yeon-seo's performance the most.

630
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:31,176
For Fantasia's Giselle this year,
the lead role Giselle will be played by

631
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:34,137
Lee Yeon-seo.

632
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:10,382
Let's accept it.

633
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:13,260
The dancers who will put on
the show voted for her.

634
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:16,054
Everyone will agree that it was fair.

635
00:50:18,014 --> 00:50:20,267
What have you done for Fantasia?

636
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,853
What have you done for Ni-na's audition?

637
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,563
They're artists?

638
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:26,898
My foot.

639
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:29,943
Those two-faced dancers can't be artists.

640
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:32,112
They took everything we offered.

641
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:33,488
How dare they stab me in the back?

642
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:35,824
What do you mean?

643
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:38,744
Did you bribe them?

644
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:39,995
Stop, stop!

645
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:42,831
If she's the lead, it's over for us.

646
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:44,124
This is the end.

647
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:46,251
No. I can't let this be.

648
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:47,753
What choice do we have?

649
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:50,005
Should Yeon-seo go blind again
for Ni-na to--

650
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:55,010
Right.

651
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:58,555
I just need to make sure
that she never performs at all costs.

652
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:01,099
Yeong-ja, come to your senses.

653
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:04,936
We've been too kind to her
since she is our family.

654
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:07,773
Right?

655
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:14,654
Ni-na.

656
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:17,324
Ni-na, where are you?

657
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:33,882
I want her to die.

658
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:37,302
I wish

659
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:40,972
Yeon-seo was dead.

660
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:47,437
Ms. Lee, can you change your pose?

661
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:49,689
We'll take another shot of your face.

662
00:51:50,106 --> 00:51:53,026
How will your Swan Lake of 2016
be different from other shows?

663
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:55,237
I'll show you the visible difference
between good and evil.

664
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,531
Can we expect to see
the best Swan Lake of the year?

665
00:51:57,906 --> 00:52:00,992
Of course.
I'll show you 32 perfect fouettés.

666
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,456
If Yeon-seo weren't here...

667
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:08,667
If she weren't here,

668
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:11,837
I would be the lead dancer.

669
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:34,317
Congratulations.

670
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:36,194
Thank you.

671
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:38,864
I convinced you too, right?

672
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:40,615
Shall we have dinner later?

673
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:44,077
-Pardon?
-I've thought a lot about this,

674
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,204
but I must tell you

675
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:48,164
why I chose you

676
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:49,791
and what happened to me.

677
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,254
I have a prior engagement.

678
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:55,338
I'll wait until you come.

679
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:56,381
Don't wait.

680
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:58,633
If it's about work,
we can do it in the studio.

681
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:00,135
If it's a private matter,

682
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:03,388
-I won't listen to you.
-You don't know anything

683
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:06,892
about the feeling I have
as I stand in front of you.

684
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:11,688
I respect you and I am grateful to you.

685
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:13,231
It's fun to work with you.

686
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:15,025
And I'm looking forward
to working with you more.

687
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:15,942
Please

688
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:17,819
don't make me uncomfortable.

689
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:19,654
You can be the judge of that
after you hear me out.

690
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:21,323
The restaurant
in front of the ballet theater.

691
00:53:21,406 --> 00:53:22,824
Meet me there after your appointment.

692
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:38,256
Yeon-seo.

693
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:40,967
Hey, people might see us.

694
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:44,220
Congratulations. You were so good.
You were beautiful.

695
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:45,805
What about my present?

696
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:47,223
What?

697
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:49,476
No way. You didn't get me anything?

698
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:53,772
I don't have a present,
but there's a place we should go to.

699
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:55,607
I need to go meet Ms. Jung.

700
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:57,067
It won't take long.

701
00:53:57,776 --> 00:53:59,778
-Where?
-Where we met for the first time.

702
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:02,739
There's something
I really want to tell you.

703
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:05,158
I'll tell you who I am
and where I came from.

704
00:54:06,242 --> 00:54:08,286
I'll tell you everything
from the beginning.

705
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:20,048
I'll have some coffee first.

706
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:21,800
I'll order food once my party arrives.

707
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:22,801
Okay.

708
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:41,403
You still have some time.

709
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:44,239
No, it's not that.

710
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:48,076
Director Ji...

711
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:50,745
What about him?

712
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:52,831
Did he yell at you
for not following his instructions?

713
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:54,374
Or did he say something weird?

714
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,751
Did he say something to you?

715
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:58,211
He said he needs to tell me something.

716
00:54:58,336 --> 00:54:59,754
He'll wait until I come.

717
00:55:00,505 --> 00:55:02,340
I did tell him that I wouldn't go.

718
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:04,801
But it's bothering me.

719
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:09,264
That man is unbelievable.
He always had his nose in the air.

720
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:11,474
He said that he'd wait for you?

721
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:13,810
Neither think about him nor tolerate him.

722
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:20,191
Are you jealous?

723
00:55:22,193 --> 00:55:24,112
-What?
-That's what it looks like.

724
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:25,363
No.

725
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:30,368
Fine. Yes. I'm jealous.

726
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:32,912
If this petty, embarrassing,
and nasty feeling is called jealousy,

727
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:35,373
you got it right. I'm jealous!

728
00:55:40,211 --> 00:55:41,171
I hate Ji Kang-woo.

729
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:42,589
I hate that he's clinging onto you.

730
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:45,175
I hate it when you two talk about ballet
which I don't know about.

731
00:55:45,258 --> 00:55:47,218
I hate it when you meet him in private.

732
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,222
So don't meet him
unless I'm with you from now on.

733
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:07,822
Do you like me that much?

734
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:14,496
Yes.

735
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:25,465
Let's go.

736
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:46,820
What's your deal with rain?

737
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:50,657
-Why do you ask?
-In hindsight,

738
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:52,951
you always ran away whenever it rained.

739
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:53,993
Didn't you?

740
00:56:54,869 --> 00:56:55,703
Well...

741
00:56:56,037 --> 00:56:58,414
Do you have a trauma about rain?
Or are you allergic to rain?

742
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:02,001
Or do you transform
into the Hulk or something?

743
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:08,299
How would you feel
if I can really do that?

744
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:14,305
What if I become something else
other than what I am now?

745
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:23,064
I'll pray that you'll return to yourself.

746
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:34,451
I'll go get an umbrella. Wait here.

747
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:36,619
I'll go with you.

748
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:45,753
I won't run away anymore.

749
00:57:46,045 --> 00:57:47,046
I'll be back soon.

750
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,359
Have a great sale today!

751
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:16,409
Excuse me!

752
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:25,752
I had a weird feeling.

753
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:28,046
It felt like

754
00:58:28,796 --> 00:58:31,299
I will search everywhere for him
in the distant future.

755
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:36,054
It felt like I would be left alone

756
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:39,849
in sadness and despair,
longing and missing him.

757
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:42,560
Yeon-seo!

758
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:00,078
Be careful.

759
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:49,294
LEE YEON-SEO

760
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:55,550
Director Ji, I'm sorry.

761
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:57,885
I feel too burdened
and I don't feel confident.

762
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:00,430
I think this is my limit.

763
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:04,267
I will end everything
at the ballet theater that I loved.

764
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,912
Where am I?

765
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:27,123
I hear cars

766
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:29,709
and a ventilator?

767
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:37,842
JI KANG-WOO

768
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:50,188
Yes, I'm all ready.

769
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:52,857
I sent him an invitation,
so he will be there soon.

770
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:55,943
We need to let him see the final moment

771
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:57,695
of the ballerina whom he adored.

772
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:03,368
A hypersensitive ballerina
who believed in conspiracy theories

773
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:04,994
because of paranoia

774
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:08,498
kills herself
due to the stress of her comeback.

775
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:11,834
It's a nice headline.

776
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:13,670
Make sure you end this well.

777
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:38,027
Is this 911?
There's a person on the rooftop.

778
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:40,446
I think she's about to fall down.
Hurry up!

779
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:50,039
Who are you?

780
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:51,708
Who sent you here?

781
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:54,419
My aunt? Was it my aunt?

782
01:01:54,502 --> 01:01:57,296
Whatever floats your boat.
This is the end anyway.

783
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:01,175
This is the rooftop
of the ballet theater, isn't it?

784
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:02,802
You should reconsider.

785
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:04,679
Do you know how many
CCTV cameras are here?

786
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:06,597
You'll definitely get caught.

787
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:10,435
You should just go.

788
01:02:11,018 --> 01:02:13,604
You don't have to take off the blindfold
or untie my hands.

789
01:02:13,938 --> 01:02:15,773
This never happened. I won't look for you.

790
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:30,997
I'm glad you made this decision.

791
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:35,334
Go. I didn't see your face.

792
01:02:52,894 --> 01:02:54,353
Thank you for letting me live.

793
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:55,980
I'm not letting you live.

794
01:02:58,691 --> 01:03:00,276
No one kills themselves

795
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:03,196
with their eyes covered and hands tied up.

796
01:03:21,255 --> 01:03:22,256
Dan.

797
01:04:12,139 --> 01:04:14,684
You'll never be able to harm her again.

798
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:16,394
Not on my watch.

799
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:18,729
You fainted. You need to rest.

800
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:19,981
Give it back to me.

801
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:23,067
There's definitely something going on.

802
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:25,903
I'm going to find the reason.

803
01:04:26,821 --> 01:04:27,822
It's you, right?

804
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:32,869
You don't truly love me.

805
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:34,996
You messed around with her memory?

806
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:37,248
Please look after her

807
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:38,666
when I'm not around.
