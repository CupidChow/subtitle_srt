1
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:49,257
I want to try doing what he did.

2
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,509
Even when I pray

3
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:54,220
or go to church, you don't seem to listen.

4
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,267
Is tomorrow's performance
truly our last chance?

5
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:02,187
Do you think we can

6
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:04,439
get across

7
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,776
how we feel and what we hope for?

8
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:12,322
I'm writing this just in case.

9
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:14,866
I want to try doing everything that I can.

10
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:18,870
Come back home safely.

11
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:21,706
I'll be back.

12
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:26,085
I never knew a moment was
the last time until it passed by,

13
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:29,631
so I never got to say goodbye properly.

14
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:41,226
I thought that
maybe this is a chance I get

15
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:44,103
to say goodbye to Dan

16
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,481
properly.

17
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,151
So that we can be happy to the very end

18
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,029
until we can have a beautiful goodbye.

19
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,464
Yeon-seo!

20
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,342
Yeon-seo!

21
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:15,426
But

22
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:18,930
is there such a thing

23
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,015
as a beautiful goodbye?

24
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,106
Yeon-seo, wake up. Yeon-seo.

25
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,316
-There might be organ damage.
-Yeon-seo.

26
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,944
The wound has been neglected for a while,
so she could be infected.

27
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:50,253
OPERATING ROOM

28
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,939
No matter how much you try
to escape from it,

29
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,899
a prophecy will come to pass.

30
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:55,568
One's destiny will be fulfilled.

31
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:07,455
Detective.

32
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,123
Where is

33
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:11,251
Keum Ru-na?

34
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,502
She's under investigation.

35
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,170
-If you wait here--
-It's not, right?

36
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:18,132
Ru-na didn't stab a person, did she?

37
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:21,552
This is a lie.

38
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:23,596
This can't be right.

39
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,556
She was caught in the act.

40
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,188
Detective,
could you let us see our daughter?

41
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:33,982
It's our last request.

42
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,028
So

43
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:42,365
you snuck into Fantasia with this knife

44
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,534
and stabbed Lee Yeon-seo. Is that right?

45
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,704
You stabbed Lee Yeon-seo,
then tried to attack

46
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,248
her secretary, Kim Dan. But you failed.

47
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:51,499
Right?

48
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:56,504
It'll take a second.

49
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,599
You can have a chat with her.

50
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,768
And as her parents,
please try to persuade her.

51
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,484
Ru-na.

52
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:31,706
I told you to never get your hands dirty.

53
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,125
Why did you do something like that?

54
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,379
Ru-na.

55
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,009
What happened to Yeon-seo?

56
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,095
She probably bled a lot.

57
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,056
How persistent.

58
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,100
I can't believe she performed
to the end in that condition.

59
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:52,602
How incredible.

60
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:57,940
Mom, Ni-na can play Giselle tomorrow.

61
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:00,735
She's going to throw a fit
and say she won't perform.

62
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,362
Make sure you persuade her
and get her on the stage--

63
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,783
Pull yourself together, Ru-na.

64
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,327
Yeon-seo is on the brink of death.

65
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,079
How can you talk about Giselle?

66
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,956
Who do you think you are to hit me?

67
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:17,251
This is why you should have worked
everything out from the beginning.

68
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,629
You let a wimpy guy
like Mr. Park do the job

69
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:20,922
and acted innocent.

70
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,381
That's why everything became a mess.

71
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,633
Keum Ru-na!

72
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,564
It has been three hours.
Will you sit down?

73
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,652
It might take even longer.

74
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,030
I said I would protect her.

75
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,743
I said I wouldn't leave her alone.

76
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,664
I'm going to protect you.

77
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:56,582
You'll never

78
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,252
be alone ever again.

79
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,462
Don't worry.

80
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:03,506
I won't ever let you go.

81
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,675
I'll protect you.

82
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,433
It's not your fault.

83
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,517
No.

84
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:16,602
It's my fault.

85
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,521
Both of you did everything you could.

86
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:19,689
After that,

87
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,233
it's not up to humans.

88
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:23,568
No.

89
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,364
Yeon-seo won't die.

90
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,451
She won't.

91
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,482
Why are you giving this to me?

92
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,317
I don't think

93
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,819
I'll be able to see her wake up.

94
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,363
Please give it to her for me.

95
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,365
Please.

96
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,703
Tell her I'm sorry I couldn't be there
when she wakes up.

97
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,248
And that I'm sorry I had to leave

98
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,334
without saying

99
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,504
a proper goodbye.

100
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:27,965
Tell her I'm very sorry.

101
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:29,926
Please tell her that.

102
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:32,762
Do it yourself.

103
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,889
It's not over yet.

104
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,103
Her blood pressure is dropping.

105
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,104
She's in cardiac arrest.

106
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,147
Bring epinephrine.

107
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,277
I lost.

108
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,073
The one who believed in you until the end

109
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,325
was Dan.

110
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,580
I hoped and prayed
that your fates would be different.

111
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:07,917
But in the back of my mind,

112
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,337
I believed you would be sacrificed.

113
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,506
That's why I was afraid.

114
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,509
I wanted to stop that from happening.

115
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:20,638
I'm sorry.

116
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:24,850
I'm sorry for everything until now.

117
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:28,813
I'm sorry

118
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:32,400
for liking you rashly.

119
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:47,998
Dan wanted me

120
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,334
to give this to you.

121
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:54,046
He said he was sorry numerous times.

122
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:57,758
I hope you think

123
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,803
that I went on a trip.

124
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,391
I hope you think

125
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,644
that I went on a long trip
to somewhere far away.

126
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,650
I hope you know

127
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,738
that I'll miss you a lot.

128
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,081
Please wake up.

129
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,878
I can't bear to see you both in torment.

130
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,514
Director Ji.

131
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,017
I'm here.

132
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,645
You should go home.

133
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,356
Go take a shower, get changed,

134
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,901
and direct the performance for tonight.

135
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,070
That's the least of my concerns.

136
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:03,491
It's Fantasia's regular performance
for 2019.

137
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,578
I'm sure she'd want you
to continue with the performance.

138
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,588
-Yes.
-Sure. I understand.

139
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:18,964
You haven't announced it, have you?

140
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,383
Hold on. No, not yet. Why?

141
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,093
We'll be doing the show tonight.

142
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,681
Hello? We will be doing the show.

143
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,183
It'll go as planned.

144
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:50,955
Director Ji.

145
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:54,208
Will we be able to perform tonight?

146
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,628
Of course. Giselle will go on.

147
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,548
You all know very well
who our audience will be.

148
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,967
We plan on inviting special guests.

149
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,594
We will invite people who have
never seen a ballet performance.

150
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,763
We'd like to show them
how beautiful ballet is.

151
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,434
Then who will be Giselle?

152
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,615
I'm only going to practice.

153
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,951
Su-ji and Jeong-eun are both capable of--

154
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,494
You should take the role.

155
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:31,453
No, I can't.

156
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,205
That's exactly what Ru-na wants.

157
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,623
-I can't do that.
-Ni-na

158
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:36,750
wasn't aware of anything.

159
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,252
I can give you my word.

160
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:39,628
We know that.

161
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:42,464
We know she called the police yesterday.

162
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,594
If the main ballerina is injured,
her understudy must take her place.

163
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,514
Thank you, everyone.

164
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,057
But I can't do that.

165
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,020
If I go on stage,
I will only taint Fantasia's reputation.

166
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,357
Don't go on stage as Keum Ru-na's sister
or Choi Yeong-ja's daughter.

167
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,860
Go up there as Ballerina Keum Ni-na.

168
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,949
I want it to be you.

169
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,084
You should do it.

170
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,674
How dare you come here?

171
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,053
How dare you?

172
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:32,473
Ms. Jung, we're on our way
to the police station.

173
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:35,809
-We wanted to see Yeon-seo before--
-Don't you dare mention her name.

174
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,269
You have no right to do that.

175
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,813
We're here to apologize

176
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:41,774
and to atone for our sins.

177
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,234
She's still unconscious after her surgery.

178
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:46,570
Do you think saying, "I'm sorry,"
will cut it?

179
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:48,822
Don't be ridiculous. Just leave.

180
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:50,950
Where's Yeon-seo's husband?

181
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,202
Let me get his approval.

182
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,963
Did Yeon-seo send you here?

183
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:08,050
I heard you're still insisting
that everything was your doing.

184
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,220
You can curse at me
and call me despicable.

185
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:16,558
But still, no mother in this world
can accuse their own child.

186
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,018
That's what a parent is.

187
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,770
I'm sure you couldn't believe it at first.

188
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,189
Did you blame yourself
for being a bad parent

189
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,942
and not teaching her well?

190
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:29,822
After that, you probably decided
to act like a righteous parent

191
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,241
by comforting her,
covering up for her wrongdoings,

192
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,868
and claiming that it was your doing.

193
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,247
You're wrong.

194
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,041
Everything that you've done so far

195
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,252
was wrong.

196
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,879
A true parent

197
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,800
would make sure their child
pays the price.

198
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,932
If you repent, you will be given
a new opportunity.

199
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,893
Because opportunities are given to humans.

200
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,396
But before that,

201
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,400
you must apologize to her.

202
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,320
Make sure you apologize sincerely
as if your life is on the line.

203
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,918
Please get up.

204
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:29,548
Get up and tell me
that you won't forgive me.

205
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,053
Tell me that you won't let this slide.

206
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,930
Let me be punished

207
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,433
while you watch.

208
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:42,895
So please

209
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,565
open your eyes, will you?

210
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,233
Yeon-seo.

211
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,403
Do you hear me?

212
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,615
I'm here to apologize.

213
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,993
We have done

214
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,331
some irreparable things to you.

215
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,542
I'm sorry, Yeon-seo.

216
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:08,837
I was wrong.

217
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:11,757
We came...

218
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,259
We came too late.

219
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,099
Yeon-seo, I'm so sorry.

220
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,539
Let's go.

221
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,388
Did you hear that?

222
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,976
Now, you just need to wake up.

223
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,439
You should be

224
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:14,153
dancing beautifully on stage right now.

225
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,906
This is too heartbreaking for me.

226
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,126
Excuse me.

227
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,004
What is it? Are you going to testify?

228
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,299
Can you check if Fantasia performed
today or not?

229
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:36,925
I'm not your secretary.

230
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,135
Please.

231
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,888
Darn it.

232
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,810
"Despite the disturbing incident
at Fantasia,

233
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,188
their show, Giselle, ended successfully."

234
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,564
Who played Giselle?

235
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,400
-Who was the dancer?
-"As for the role of Giselle,

236
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:57,404
Ms. Keum Ni-na delivered
the best performance of her career."

237
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,283
It's a happy ending for us.

238
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,786
Can you show me the video? Please?

239
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,331
I have to see my sister dance.

240
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:18,342
Ballerina Keum Ni-na who delivered
a perfect performance

241
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,177
announced her retirement.

242
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,846
Ballerina Keum Ni-na

243
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:25,557
will take moral responsibility
for her family's actions.

244
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:26,767
And she said

245
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:29,811
she would never perform on stage again.

246
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:31,897
No.

247
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,358
No. No, Ni-na.

248
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,193
No! This can't be!

249
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,528
No, no...

250
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,973
LEE YEON-SEO

251
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:05,866
I feel empty.

252
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,535
This feels pointless.

253
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,371
She fought every single day.

254
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:15,083
To her, every minute, every second
of her life was a battle.

255
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:17,878
But look at her now.

256
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:21,548
She'll wake up.

257
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,217
You know that she's extraordinary.

258
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:33,810
Here, Ms. Jung.

259
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,192
Her doctor said

260
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:44,237
he wouldn't be surprised
even if she died any minute.

261
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,115
Her brain was severely damaged

262
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,950
because of the cardiac arrest
she had in surgery.

263
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:50,535
Even if she wakes up,

264
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,621
she may not be able
to recover to her old self.

265
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:59,002
It looks like
she's still struggling every day.

266
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,297
She's trying to hold

267
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,674
onto the flame of life
that's about to go out.

268
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,594
I'm sure she's waiting.

269
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,642
You can't reach Dan either, can you?

270
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,731
No, I haven't seen him since that day.

271
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,235
That jerk.

272
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:24,903
Heartless man.

273
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:28,281
How could he run away
after abandoning her like this?

274
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,033
I clearly warned him.

275
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,494
Why did he marry her? How could he?

276
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:33,870
I'm sure

277
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,124
he had to leave for an urgent matter.

278
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:38,917
He probably couldn't

279
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:40,544
do anything about it.

280
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,672
If that's the case,
he should have called me.

281
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,842
Ms. Lee is struggling to live every day.

282
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:06,027
Did you...

283
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,696
It was stained with her blood.

284
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,573
I couldn't just leave it as it was.

285
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,241
It was horrible.

286
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,452
This foolish girl

287
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,789
danced on stage after wrapping
herself with bandages.

288
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:34,431
He was definitely dissipated
right in front of me.

289
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:51,239
Yeon-seo.

290
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:54,618
Yeon-seo.

291
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,746
Yeon-seo.

292
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,345
Dan.

293
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:14,638
Did you sleep well?

294
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,849
You are alive.

295
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,936
I knew you would be.

296
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:32,697
Let's go.

297
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:34,991
Be it our honeymoon trip or whatever.

298
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,327
I'll take you wherever you want to go.

299
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:39,454
Where shall we go?

300
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,502
Home. I want to go home.

301
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:47,379
Our home.

302
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,028
-We're home.
-We're home.

303
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:21,955
Here.

304
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:33,216
It really feels like I'm home.

305
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,718
You are really home.

306
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:38,013
What happened?

307
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:49,607
I thought that was the end.

308
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:51,776
But...

309
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:22,766
"Listen, Angel Dan.

310
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:26,811
Angel Dan, you were given a mission

311
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:30,857
to let Lee Yeon-seo, a human,
know what true love is.

312
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,526
You became a human
to carry out this mission.

313
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,613
Love that can cover everything

314
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,991
is risking your life
and sacrificing yourself.

315
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:43,787
You have successfully
finished your mission.

316
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:45,789
However,

317
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:49,542
you have committed a sin
of loving a human as an angel.

318
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:52,170
But

319
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:55,673
the earnest prayers
of the Archangel were heard,

320
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,968
and you stopped yourself
from committing a mortal sin.

321
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,850
I gladly accept the beautiful dance

322
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,396
and forgive your sin.

323
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:11,773
Therefore,

324
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:13,817
Angel Dan

325
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,277
will leave the earth

326
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:19,114
and return to paradise."

327
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,210
So you didn't become a human.

328
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,464
You're still an angel.

329
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:38,925
Are you disappointed?

330
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,179
I'm happy as long as you don't disappear.

331
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:45,557
Because if you do,

332
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,476
I feel like I will too.

333
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,480
I didn't turn to dust thanks to you.

334
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:54,357
You're the reason why I'm here.

335
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,160
I truly missed this smell.

336
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:10,457
Me too.

337
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,087
Let's plant these rapeseeds.

338
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,007
-What should I do?
-Press them down.

339
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,049
Pour it.

340
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:21,551
KIM DAN, YOO SEONG-U

341
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:22,719
Slowly.

342
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:25,597
Here.

343
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,267
Come here.

344
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,523
My gosh!

345
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,318
It's really scary, isn't it?

346
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,153
No, it's not scary at all.

347
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:42,280
Then why were you surprised?

348
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:44,240
They said girls should do this.

349
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,117
What?

350
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:52,332
Hey.

351
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:53,958
What are you doing?

352
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,002
What's wrong?

353
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,384
Not too hard.

354
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,521
One, two, three.

355
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,776
My forehead became red.

356
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:21,861
No, it didn't. It looks the same.

357
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,281
-This one.
-Be careful.

358
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,204
Come here. This will hurt.

359
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:35,542
"'It's me. I came because I missed you.'

360
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:39,170
But sadly, the Little Mermaid's voice

361
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,047
didn't come out.

362
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:45,426
The prince couldn't recognize her."

363
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:47,595
What a jerk.

364
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:50,265
He had a great time
with the Little Mermaid

365
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,559
and then ended up
marrying some other girl.

366
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:53,852
He didn't know, that's why.

367
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,022
Go on.

368
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,900
Change the story by saying
that the prince found out

369
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,903
and married the Little Mermaid instead.

370
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,200
Goodness, you always need
to have it your way.

371
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:12,120
"Her sisters told her.

372
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:14,956
'Pierce the prince's heart
with this dagger.

373
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:18,459
If you don't, you'll turn into foam.'

374
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,254
The Little Mermaid replied with a smile.

375
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:23,631
'It's okay.

376
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:25,466
I'm still happy.'"

377
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,344
Dan.

378
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:30,013
Yes?

379
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:33,975
This is a dream, right?

380
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:42,942
How did you know?

381
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,246
Your heart

382
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,250
isn't beating.

383
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:27,570
You are just

384
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,281
an illusion.

385
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,409
I missed you so much,

386
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:36,162
so I created you.

387
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,636
I'm not an illusion.

388
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:54,347
It's really me.

389
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:01,354
"Angel Dan

390
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,023
will leave the earth

391
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,234
and return to paradise."

392
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:23,334
No.

393
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:26,045
I won't leave.

394
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:31,634
Are you allowed to do that?

395
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,596
I couldn't say a proper goodbye to you.

396
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:37,807
I'm going

397
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,853
to die soon, aren't I?

398
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:44,939
That's why

399
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,483
you're here.

400
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,028
It's our last farewell.

401
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,873
Listen to me carefully, Yeon-seo.

402
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,878
At first, I was flustered

403
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:08,838
and then mad at Him.

404
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:12,300
I didn't understand why
He brought us together,

405
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:14,719
only to make me witness your death.

406
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:17,096
It was too painful.

407
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:20,433
But after giving it some thought,

408
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:23,144
I think the time that was given to us

409
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:26,230
was a gift.

410
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,276
It's not a gift when you take it back.

411
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:38,493
I...

412
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:40,661
didn't die that night

413
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:42,914
and was given 100 days.

414
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:47,919
And because of that,
I was able to meet you, recognize you,

415
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:51,380
and fall in love with you.

416
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,800
This is enough for me.

417
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:56,594
It truly is.

418
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,766
I hope you laugh a lot.

419
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:03,976
You can cry at times.

420
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,020
But don't cry too much.

421
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:08,481
And dance all you want.

422
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,650
Be happy.

423
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,737
At times, be fussy.

424
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:18,449
Live like a human being.

425
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:21,160
You want me to live?

426
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:22,495
It's my last wish.

427
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:24,747
I want to give

428
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,166
my last breath to you.

429
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:39,595
I loved you.

430
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:43,808
I love you.

431
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:48,729
And I'll keep loving you.

432
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,633
I tried to fight against destiny.

433
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:19,677
But looking back,

434
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:22,805
everything was based on my choice.

435
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,642
Saving Yeon-seo,

436
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:28,686
loving her,

437
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,606
trying to kill an evil person,

438
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:34,275
and not killing her.

439
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,821
I was given this life once again
as an angel,

440
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,240
and I'd like to give it to her.

441
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:43,409
This is

442
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:45,620
my

443
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,080
final decision.

444
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:54,629
Goodbye,

445
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,008
Yeon-seo.

446
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:44,720
Ms. Lee.

447
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:46,931
You woke up!

448
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:48,599
You woke up!

449
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,352
You survived!

450
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,229
Doctor!

451
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:09,495
3 MONTHS LATER

452
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:12,665
I'm the new chairwoman, Lee Yeon-seo.

453
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,583
Let me officially introduce myself.

454
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:15,876
How are you feeling?

455
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:17,586
It's your first time outside
in three months.

456
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:18,838
I can't dance right now,

457
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,715
but I'm going through
rehabilitation training now.

458
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,425
And meanwhile,

459
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:25,511
Director Ji managed
the ballet theater very well.

460
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:28,723
Don't you want a grand inauguration
after that terrible incident?

461
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:30,808
I should cut down
on unnecessary expenses first.

462
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:33,769
I plan to overhaul
all of the existing systems

463
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:35,604
the predecessor had been using.

464
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,441
I plan to hire a group
of management specialists.

465
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:39,775
More than anything,

466
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:43,487
Fantasia Ballet Theater will take
a step closer to the public.

467
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:46,490
I plan to bring back Visiting Ballet
during the second half of the year.

468
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:56,292
Are you all right?

469
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:58,336
I'm fine.

470
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:00,546
I even started to make turns last week.

471
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,131
I was asking about your heart.

472
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:05,509
You didn't step a foot outside once
for the past three months.

473
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:06,844
In your first week,

474
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,889
you stayed in your room and cried all day.

475
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:15,019
People who are left behind
must go on with their lives

476
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:17,772
although nothing can be as cruel as that.

477
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:20,066
Director Ji,

478
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:21,901
I have this hope.

479
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:24,403
It's like having a hunch.

480
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,906
A hunch that I might
be able to meet Dan again.

481
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:30,576
Don't you know
what it means to be dissipated?

482
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:32,578
After looking at the handkerchief,
I wasn't sure.

483
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:34,538
But right now, the feather on it

484
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:36,457
turned black.

485
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,125
And so is yours.

486
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:39,668
But you are

487
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:41,796
alive and well.

488
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:44,882
I didn't know that I'd be able
to meet Seong-u again.

489
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:47,301
Meeting a dead boy

490
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,220
is actually impossible.

491
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:50,679
But I met him after he became Dan.

492
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:52,348
-Then--
-Even if you met him again,

493
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,683
he came to you
after losing all of his memories.

494
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,144
If Kim Dan can't recognize you,

495
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:00,398
-do you think that's really him?
-I don't care.

496
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:02,066
I remember him.

497
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:12,576
What happened?

498
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,954
Isn't today her final trial?

499
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,831
I told you I wanted
to watch the trial in court.

500
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:18,582
Would you want to see her face again?

501
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,209
I don't even want to see her in my dream.

502
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:23,838
-Where?
-It's up.

503
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,591
-Wait, 17 years?
-"Violation of medical law,

504
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,969
attempted assault, obstruction of
business, flight from police..."

505
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:31,929
That's a long list.

506
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:33,889
She gets 17 years in prison?

507
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:36,350
Chairman Keum Ki-chun will serve
six years in prison.

508
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,853
Mr. Park had mitigating factors,

509
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,104
so he got seven years.

510
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:41,939
What about her?

511
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:43,774
Associate Director Keum Ru-na?

512
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:46,694
Defendant Keum Ru-na

513
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:50,990
is guilty of murder,
obstruction of business, and assault.

514
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:54,368
Given that the defendant shows
no signs of remorse,

515
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,162
her acts are considered depraved,

516
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:58,581
and it is highly likely that
she will commit another crime,

517
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:02,626
the court sentences
Defendant Keum Ru-na to life in prison.

518
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:11,343
Inmate 5030. You have a visitor.

519
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,680
I don't have anyone to visit me.

520
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:16,390
Who is it?

521
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:18,225
She said she's your sister.

522
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:41,582
How are you my sister?

523
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:43,167
I know.

524
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:45,503
I really hate that too.

525
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:47,421
Are you here to mock me?

526
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,548
To see how low I have gone?

527
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,967
Well, that's part of it.

528
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,095
I heard that
you kept trying to kill yourself.

529
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:57,264
I came here to tell you not to do that.

530
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:00,976
Are you worried about me now?

531
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,437
Yes, I'm worried that you might try to die

532
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:04,939
in order to run away

533
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:07,024
from paying for what you did.

534
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:09,485
Ru-na.

535
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:12,154
Have you ever

536
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:16,116
loved someone with all of your heart?

537
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:19,078
Are you that stupid?

538
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,956
Who do you think I did all of this for?

539
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,332
Stop lying.

540
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,709
You've never loved Ni-na.

541
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:28,671
You would never do this
if you truly loved her.

542
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:31,257
You would rather die,
so you could save that person.

543
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,803
You have never

544
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:38,931
felt this way. Not once.

545
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:40,849
That's why your heart is empty.

546
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:43,435
And you're desperately
trying to fill that empty heart.

547
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,939
What do you know?
How dare you run your mouth?

548
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:47,940
I truly

549
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,192
pity you

550
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:53,070
because you will live here
for the rest of your life

551
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:55,948
without knowing
how precious and beautiful love is.

552
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:00,035
Stay healthy.

553
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:20,931
Why did you want to come here?

554
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:23,017
I'm sure just the sight of her
disgusts you.

555
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,518
I wanted to tell her

556
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:27,104
that she has been completely defeated.

557
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,191
You're back, Ms. Lee.

558
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:32,985
I'm happy.

559
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:35,904
Now that everything is settled,

560
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,907
forget about everything
and go back to the old you.

561
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,826
Okay?

562
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:59,219
Are you sure you guys have no idea?

563
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,806
I definitely put the handkerchief
in the drawer right there.

564
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,475
As soon as I got discharged,
I put it there

565
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:07,269
and never took it out.
But that handkerchief is gone!

566
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,814
-Ms. Lee.
-How does this make sense?

567
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:12,775
They've neither seen nor touched it.

568
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:17,655
Are you telling me that a handkerchief
somehow walked out of the house and left?

569
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:19,990
I told her to be her old self.
And her temper is back too.

570
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:21,575
Please!

571
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,375
I'm begging you.

572
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,586
When you clean my room and Dan's room,

573
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:35,631
please do not touch anything in the rooms.

574
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,011
The person who finds the handkerchief

575
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:42,763
will get a 200-percent bonus.

576
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:11,583
Why did you call the doctor?

577
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:12,918
I told you I was fine.

578
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:14,169
If you were fine,

579
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,588
why would you come to the park
on rainy days like a crazy woman?

580
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,298
And if you were fine,

581
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:20,384
why would you talk to yourself at home?

582
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:36,984
How long does it take to brew this?

583
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:40,237
No matter how much I try,
it doesn't taste like the one you made.

584
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:46,243
About three minutes?
Won't the tea be too bitter then?

585
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:50,080
It's too hot.

586
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:57,421
Don't just stand there. Come and hold me.

587
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,089
Come on.

588
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,552
No, that was...

589
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,513
I did that because
I saw an illusion of him.

590
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:08,432
And that hallucination is a symptom.

591
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:15,856
Actually, when we first met,

592
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,025
I sensed that he was there.

593
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:20,652
No one could see him,
but I was the only one who could.

594
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:23,071
So the Dan I'm seeing right now

595
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,657
might be real. No?

596
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:28,744
I'll prescribe you medicine.

597
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:31,371
Make sure you take your medicine.

598
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:48,305
Ms. Lee.

599
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:51,892
Want to have some soju?

600
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:55,854
You won't take the medicine, will you?

601
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:58,232
You can drink it then.

602
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:01,235
Sometimes, this is better than medicine.

603
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:05,072
Ms. Jung, give me back the handkerchief.

604
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:08,742
I'm telling the truth. I didn't take it.

605
00:47:08,825 --> 00:47:11,286
You are the only one who hates Dan.

606
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:15,123
Darn it.

607
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:24,967
What's this?

608
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:27,135
Mementos to people who were left behind.

609
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:28,804
And trash to people

610
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:30,597
who ran away.

611
00:47:38,855 --> 00:47:40,315
His clothes are still here.

612
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:45,988
All of his stuff is still here.

613
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,489
Where on earth did he--

614
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:02,879
HAPPY FIRST WEDDING ANNIVERSARY!

615
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:06,925
Why did you give me this now?

616
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:10,053
Look how he wrote those
even before your performance.

617
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:12,222
He was already thinking
about leaving then.

618
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:14,683
That's why he was in a rush
to get married.

619
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:16,143
This is Dan's

620
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,563
handwriting.

621
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:25,569
Happy first wedding anniversary!

622
00:48:27,904 --> 00:48:30,365
This is the first letter
I write to a human and not the deity.

623
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:31,700
Isn't it an honor?

624
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,124
Happy second wedding anniversary!
I love you.

625
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:47,674
Happy third wedding anniversary!

626
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:49,551
Did the rapeseed flowers
bloom beautifully?

627
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:54,348
Happy 10th wedding anniversary!

628
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:57,976
Gosh, you're still not over me?

629
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:03,857
Happy 30th wedding anniversary!

630
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:05,484
I still

631
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:07,819
love you the same.

632
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:16,411
Wait...

633
00:49:25,962 --> 00:49:28,590
I really shouldn't drink too much.

634
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:31,843
Drink up.

635
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:34,471
Drink up and forget everything.

636
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:36,473
Forget it.

637
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:39,810
Exactly.

638
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:44,648
I heard brain cells get damaged
when someone drinks.

639
00:49:45,023 --> 00:49:47,693
That means I'll forget.
No, I can't do that.

640
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:51,530
I won't even forget an eyelash on him.

641
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:57,786
Ms. Lee, pull yourself together.

642
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:03,041
I really feel like Dan is with me.

643
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:06,211
I keep seeing him.

644
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:09,464
Look over there.

645
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:12,718
He's standing right there.

646
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,511
Dan!

647
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:17,723
What's over there? Nothing is there.

648
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,809
You're scaring me. Stop it.

649
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:23,645
Did I really go crazy?

650
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:25,856
Take the medicine.

651
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:29,109
You can talk to a doctor and get treated.

652
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:30,026
No.

653
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,695
If I take medicine,

654
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:34,114
I won't be able to see him.

655
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:36,074
If I get treated,

656
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:38,493
I won't be able to see him anymore.

657
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:41,705
If I can see him
because I have gone insane,

658
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:46,084
then I wish to remain insane.

659
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:49,463
I just want to be crazy
24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

660
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:50,756
But...

661
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:54,342
But I can't live like that.

662
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:58,430
He gave me his life.
He gave me this breath.

663
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:02,684
I have to live really well

664
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:07,731
because I have to live for Dan too.

665
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:13,737
I miss you.

666
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:16,823
I want to hug you.

667
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:21,119
I want to smell you, Dan.

668
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:55,695
REPORT

669
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:01,451
After wandering around the deep darkness,

670
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:04,996
Angel Dan reports back
with another mission.

671
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:16,424
How long does it take to brew this?

672
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:19,344
No matter how much I try,
it doesn't taste like the one you made.

673
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:22,514
Will three minutes be okay?

674
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:31,606
Don't just stand there. Come and hold me.

675
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:35,026
Come on.

676
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:44,452
He's standing right there.

677
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:45,745
Dan!

678
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:49,457
What's over there? Nothing is there.

679
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:52,544
-Thank you.
-You're scaring me. Stop it.

680
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:54,379
You let me stay with her

681
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:57,424
even if she cannot see me.

682
00:52:58,550 --> 00:52:59,676
It's all right.

683
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:03,763
Even if she doesn't know to the end,
even if nobody knows,

684
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:06,892
even if I must just watch her
like this forever,

685
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:09,686
it's all right with me.

686
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:27,829
This is disappointing.

687
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:30,206
I wanted to perform
one more time with you.

688
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:33,043
You won't listen to me
and dance the way you want anyway.

689
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:36,087
And it was fun creating
a performance like that, right?

690
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:39,966
Thank you for everything.

691
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:43,178
Me too.

692
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:46,348
Are you sure you'll leave
without seeing the corps?

693
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:48,516
I hate doing something like that.

694
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:50,101
It's embarrassing and awkward.

695
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:51,436
Okay, then.

696
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:56,816
Director Ji.

697
00:53:59,694 --> 00:54:00,654
Do you feel

698
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,073
more at ease now?

699
00:54:12,248 --> 00:54:14,209
Is there a prima ballerina
you're looking for?

700
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:16,127
Not sure. I'll look for one.

701
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:19,589
There is a great ballerina I know.

702
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:21,341
Do you want to meet her?

703
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:29,516
You can't run away like this.

704
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,768
You should try to lose your temper
when you're in New York.

705
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:35,105
Thank you for everything.

706
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:37,232
Take care of your health wherever you go.

707
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:42,487
Eun-yeong, U-jin. Lower the lift
for the lead role evaluation.

708
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:44,489
Su-ji, make sure
you always watch your shoulders.

709
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:45,490
And--

710
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:48,368
Come on, you're nagging us
until the very end.

711
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:50,704
Just make sure you look after yourself.

712
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:54,582
Thanks. Great work.

713
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:55,834
Great work, everyone.

714
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:57,293
Thank you. Great work.

715
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:58,670
-Thank you, Director Ji.
-Thank you.

716
00:54:58,753 --> 00:55:00,588
-Let's take a picture.
-Time for a picture.

717
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:02,507
Okay.

718
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:04,968
Make sure your face is shown.

719
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:07,178
-Lower it a little.
-I can't see myself.

720
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:10,724
-Okay, Fantasia!
-Fantasia!

721
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:24,362
Up. To your places.

722
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:28,033
You shouldn't look in the mirror.

723
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:30,285
Down. To your fingertips.

724
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:32,912
Your eyes.

725
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:34,080
Come here.

726
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:36,791
What did I say you need to look at
when you're dancing?

727
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,001
Myself.

728
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:41,171
You're right. When you hear this music,
what do you feel you've become?

729
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:43,006
A cloud in the sky.

730
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:45,717
Right? Then you can feel that
when you try again.

731
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,802
Everyone, let's take it from the top.

732
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:05,737
That's a cup of drip coffee. Very fancy.

733
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:09,032
I have to save up in order to pay my rent.

734
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:15,080
I heard you're going to New York.
Ui-geon told me.

735
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:16,372
Congratulations.

736
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:20,210
Are you sure you don't want to
return as a performer?

737
00:56:21,377 --> 00:56:23,046
I think this fits me the best.

738
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:25,423
Dancing happily with children.

739
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:27,217
I feel content.

740
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:30,303
If you change your mind,
come whenever you want.

741
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:34,516
I'm an expert on bringing back
a ballerina who retired.

742
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:39,938
When we meet again, I hope I can meet you

743
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:42,690
as a normal person, not a ballerina.

744
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:11,094
I'm glad that
she has been taking the medicine.

745
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:14,556
It's not even raining.

746
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:17,183
Where did Ms. Lee go?

747
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:24,649
Everything is going back to its place.

748
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:28,528
I guess they are
all going back to the beginning.

749
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:37,704
But

750
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:39,622
you aren't here.

751
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:44,919
I can't see you as a hallucination either.

752
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:49,924
I'll be brave.

753
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:53,386
I'll believe that you are
watching me from somewhere.

754
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:43,770
Nothing is written on it again.

755
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:46,356
This is a huge scam.

756
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:48,608
How can I not get it even once?

757
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,203
Today.

758
00:59:00,745 --> 00:59:01,663
Right here.

759
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:09,045
This is so weird.

760
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:16,302
I only spent

761
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:19,138
a season with Dan.

762
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:25,353
But why do I feel

763
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:29,524
completely empty?

764
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:36,864
I will be brave.

765
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:38,408
I will.

766
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:41,160
But

767
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:45,623
let me think of you and cry
from time to time.

768
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:17,155
Yeon-seo, pull yourself together.

769
01:00:29,667 --> 01:00:30,585
Dan.

770
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:33,796
Dan, come out.

771
01:01:35,149 --> 01:01:36,067
Can you

772
01:01:36,901 --> 01:01:37,819
see me?

773
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:44,617
How can this happen?

774
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:47,829
I knew

775
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:52,041
you would come.

776
01:02:02,593 --> 01:02:04,804
This is my final report.

777
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:09,684
It is very interesting to observe humans.

778
01:02:11,018 --> 01:02:13,354
If the time of eternity
is colored in black and white,

779
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:17,275
humans shine in all kinds of colors,
as if they can be shattered at any moment.

780
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:20,194
That's what makes them interesting.

781
01:02:21,195 --> 01:02:22,530
When the mission is over,

782
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:24,824
everything will return to its place.

783
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:27,660
Humans will die and disappear.

784
01:02:28,369 --> 01:02:31,247
Angels will fly around forever.

785
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:33,875
That is the deity's...

786
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:35,918
The universe's providence.

787
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,715
In this providence, we will live happily

788
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:43,009
with this miraculous love.

789
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:46,304
In fragility and brilliance,

790
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:48,723
as we shine radiantly.

791
01:02:49,223 --> 01:02:51,100
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
ANGEL'S LAST MISSION:LOVE
