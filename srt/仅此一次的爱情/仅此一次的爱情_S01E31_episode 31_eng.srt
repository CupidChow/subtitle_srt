1
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:07,513
 I want to try doing what he did. 

2
00:00:07,513 --> 00:00:12,363
 Even when I pray or go to church, You don't seem to listen to me. 

3
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:16,283
  Is tomorrow's stage really the last chance for us?  

4
00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:18,143
♫   As if by chance ♫ 

5
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:23,193
 Do you think we can express  

6
00:00:23,193 --> 00:00:24,883
 our feelings and our hopes? 

7
00:00:24,883 --> 00:00:27,713
♫  ...remembers you like  ♫

8
00:00:27,713 --> 00:00:29,903
 I'm writing this, just in case, 

9
00:00:29,903 --> 00:00:32,233
 because I want to try everything I can. 

10
00:00:32,233 --> 00:00:34,633
♫   ...come ♫ 

11
00:00:34,633 --> 00:00:37,893
 Come back safely. 

12
00:00:37,893 --> 00:00:40,283
 I'll be back. 

13
00:00:40,283 --> 00:00:44,633
 I never knew a moment was the last moment until it passed by, 

14
00:00:44,633 --> 00:00:47,263
 so I never got to properly say goodbye. 

15
00:00:47,263 --> 00:00:50,803
♫   You never leave my mind ♫ 

16
00:00:50,803 --> 00:00:54,143
♫   Even my naive ♫ 

17
00:00:54,143 --> 00:00:55,363
♫  Always blow  ♫

18
00:00:55,363 --> 00:00:59,183
 I thought this might be a chance I get 

19
00:00:59,183 --> 00:01:02,283
 to say goodbye to Dan properly. 

20
00:01:02,283 --> 00:01:04,973
 I thought about it. 

21
00:01:04,973 --> 00:01:09,853
 So we can live happily till the end and we can have a proper goodbye. 

22
00:01:09,853 --> 00:01:15,743
♫   You never leave my mind ♫ 

23
00:01:17,773 --> 00:01:24,793


24
00:01:27,473 --> 00:01:30,013
Yeon Seo!

25
00:01:30,013 --> 00:01:31,563
Yeon Seo!

26
00:01:31,563 --> 00:01:36,763
 But... a beautiful goodbye, 

27
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,963
 is there a thing like that in the world? 

28
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:45,603
Yeon Seo!  Wake up, Yeon Seo!

29
00:01:45,603 --> 00:01:46,503
Yeon Seo.

30
00:01:46,503 --> 00:01:47,543
There may be organ damage.

31
00:01:47,543 --> 00:01:48,753
She neglected it for a while,

32
00:01:48,753 --> 00:01:50,803
so it might be infected.

33
00:02:32,963 --> 00:02:39,253
     

34
00:03:05,883 --> 00:03:08,013
 No matter how much you try to escape from it, 

35
00:03:08,013 --> 00:03:10,163
 a prophecy will come to pass. 

36
00:03:10,163 --> 00:03:13,913
 One's destiny must be fulfilled. 

37
00:03:21,863 --> 00:03:23,633
     

38
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:24,993
Detective.

39
00:03:24,993 --> 00:03:28,443
Where's Geum Roo Na?

40
00:03:28,443 --> 00:03:30,343
She's in the midst of an investigation. Please wait—

41
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:32,123
It's not true, right?

42
00:03:32,123 --> 00:03:36,523
My Roo Na didn't stab a person.

43
00:03:37,713 --> 00:03:39,803
It's a lie.

44
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:40,773
There's no way!

45
00:03:40,773 --> 00:03:43,803
She was caught in the act.

46
00:03:47,023 --> 00:03:49,743
Detective, let us meet with our daughter for a moment.

47
00:03:49,743 --> 00:03:52,113
It's my last request.

48
00:03:54,913 --> 00:03:59,663
So, you snuck into Fantasia with this knife

49
00:03:59,663 --> 00:04:02,803
and stabbed Lee Yeon Seo, right?

50
00:04:02,803 --> 00:04:05,203
You stabbed Lee Yeon Seo, then you tried to attack

51
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:09,473
her secretary, Kim Dan, and failed. Right?

52
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:14,603
Excuse me for a moment.

53
00:04:24,143 --> 00:04:26,223
You can have a short conversation with her

54
00:04:26,223 --> 00:04:28,683
and try to persuade her.

55
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,443
Roo Na,

56
00:04:45,763 --> 00:04:49,253
didn't I tell you not to get your hands dirty? Huh?

57
00:04:49,253 --> 00:04:52,253
Why did you do something like that?

58
00:04:54,533 --> 00:04:56,353
Geum Roo Na.

59
00:04:57,933 --> 00:05:01,723
What happened with Yeon Seo?

60
00:05:01,723 --> 00:05:03,823
She must have bled a lot.

61
00:05:03,823 --> 00:05:08,613
How persistent she is. I can't believe she danced to the end in that condition.

62
00:05:08,613 --> 00:05:10,863
She's really amazing.

63
00:05:12,273 --> 00:05:15,813
Mom, Ni Na is tomorrow's Giselle!

64
00:05:15,813 --> 00:05:18,183
She'll throw a fit and say that she won't perform.

65
00:05:18,183 --> 00:05:21,553
Make sure you persuade her. Make her perform on the sta—

66
00:05:22,243 --> 00:05:24,583
Come to your senses, Geum Roo Na!

67
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:29,293
Yeon Seo is on the verge of death right now. How can you talk about "Giselle"?

68
00:05:29,293 --> 00:05:31,633
Who are you to hit me, Mom?

69
00:05:31,633 --> 00:05:35,073
This is why you should've done everything properly from the beginning.

70
00:05:35,073 --> 00:05:38,173
You got a feeble man like Mr. Park to do the job and pretended to be innocent.

71
00:05:38,173 --> 00:05:39,703
That's why everything became such a mess.

72
00:05:39,703 --> 00:05:41,973
Geum Roo Na!

73
00:05:53,863 --> 00:05:56,653
It has been three hours. Will you sit down?

74
00:05:58,153 --> 00:06:01,453
It might take even longer.

75
00:06:01,453 --> 00:06:03,903
I told her I'd protect her.

76
00:06:05,903 --> 00:06:09,053
I said I wouldn't leave her side even once.

77
00:06:10,483 --> 00:06:12,693
  I'll protect you.  

78
00:06:12,693 --> 00:06:17,423
  I won't... leave you alone again.  

79
00:06:17,423 --> 00:06:19,523
  Don't worry.  

80
00:06:19,523 --> 00:06:23,703
 I'll never let you go now. I'll protect you. 

81
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:30,583
It's not your fault.

82
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:33,773
No. It's my fault.

83
00:06:33,773 --> 00:06:35,823
You two did everything you could.

84
00:06:35,823 --> 00:06:39,703
The rest is not in the hands of humans.

85
00:06:39,703 --> 00:06:41,533
No.

86
00:06:44,093 --> 00:06:46,323
Yeon Seo won't die.

87
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,763
She'll never die.

88
00:07:18,303 --> 00:07:19,813
Why are you giving it to me?

89
00:07:19,813 --> 00:07:25,283
When Yeon Seo wakes up, I don't think I'll be able to see her.

90
00:07:25,283 --> 00:07:29,303
Instead, please relay this to her. I ask this of you.

91
00:07:30,103 --> 00:07:33,763
Tell her that I'm sorry I can't be there for her when she wakes up

92
00:07:33,763 --> 00:07:39,273
and for parting ways without saying a proper last goodbye.

93
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:46,053
I'm really, really sorry.

94
00:07:46,053 --> 00:07:48,133
Please tell her that.

95
00:07:48,703 --> 00:07:53,053
Do it yourself!  It's not the end yet.

96
00:07:57,003 --> 00:07:59,243
Her blood pressure is dropping. It's cardiac arrest!

97
00:07:59,243 --> 00:08:01,053
Bring the epinephrine.

98
00:08:24,473 --> 00:08:26,623
Now, shock.

99
00:08:33,823 --> 00:08:38,193
     

100
00:09:30,853 --> 00:09:34,783


101
00:09:38,233 --> 00:09:40,383
   

102
00:10:09,293 --> 00:10:11,363
I lost.

103
00:10:12,303 --> 00:10:17,313
The one who believed in you till the end was Kim Dan.

104
00:10:18,503 --> 00:10:22,713
I hoped and prayed your fates would be different.

105
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:29,193
But in the back of my head, I believed you'd be sacrificed.

106
00:10:29,193 --> 00:10:34,523
That's why I was scared. I wanted to stop that from happening.

107
00:10:36,633 --> 00:10:38,803
I'm sorry.

108
00:10:38,803 --> 00:10:43,173
From the beginning till now, I'm sorry for everything.

109
00:10:44,753 --> 00:10:46,983
I liked you without your permission.

110
00:10:48,253 --> 00:10:50,203
I'm sorry for that.

111
00:11:04,143 --> 00:11:08,593
Kim Dan wanted me to give this to you.

112
00:11:09,203 --> 00:11:12,043
He said he was sorry countless times.

113
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:18,813
 I hope she thinks that I went on a trip. 

114
00:11:21,103 --> 00:11:26,673
 I hope she thinks that I went on a long trip somewhere far away. 

115
00:11:29,253 --> 00:11:32,693
 I hope she thinks that  

116
00:11:35,433 --> 00:11:37,713
 I will miss her a lot. 

117
00:11:44,903 --> 00:11:47,373
Please get up already.

118
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:52,093
I can't bear to see you both suffer.

119
00:12:01,493 --> 00:12:06,043
Director, I'm here.

120
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:08,993
Go back home now.

121
00:12:08,993 --> 00:12:11,973
Go wash up and change your clothes.

122
00:12:11,973 --> 00:12:14,573
Please, direct the show at Fantasia tonight.

123
00:12:16,013 --> 00:12:17,683
That's the least of my concerns.

124
00:12:17,683 --> 00:12:21,423
It's the 2019 Fantasia Regular Stage.

125
00:12:22,353 --> 00:12:25,723
I'm sure she'd want you to continue with the show.

126
00:12:33,373 --> 00:12:34,683
Ah, yes.

127
00:12:34,683 --> 00:12:36,233
You haven't announced it yet, right?

128
00:12:36,233 --> 00:12:38,543
Hold on. No, not yet. But—

129
00:12:38,543 --> 00:12:41,213
We'll be doing the show tonight.

130
00:12:42,813 --> 00:12:44,863
Yes, we'll be doing the show tonight.

131
00:12:44,863 --> 00:12:47,253
It'll go on as planned.

132
00:13:07,103 --> 00:13:12,443
Director Ji, will we be able to perform tonight?

133
00:13:12,443 --> 00:13:14,973
Definitely. "Giselle" must go on.

134
00:13:14,973 --> 00:13:17,733
You all know very well who our audience will be today.

135
00:13:17,733 --> 00:13:20,343
  We're thinking of inviting special guests.  

136
00:13:20,343 --> 00:13:22,693
  People who've never seen ballet once since they were born.  

137
00:13:22,693 --> 00:13:25,763
  We'll give those people a beautiful gift.  

138
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:30,523
Then, who will be Giselle?

139
00:13:41,103 --> 00:13:44,373
I'm only thinking of practicing.

140
00:13:44,373 --> 00:13:45,913
Soo Ji and Jeong Eun Unnie are good enough.

141
00:13:45,913 --> 00:13:48,713
- You do it, Ni Na. Giselle.
 - No.

142
00:13:48,713 --> 00:13:51,033
That's what my sister Roo Na planned. How can I do it?

143
00:13:51,033 --> 00:13:55,543
Ni Na didn't know anything, I can attest to that.

144
00:13:55,543 --> 00:14:00,423
We know that, too, and that Ni Na called the police yesterday.

145
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:04,863
If the prima ballerina is injured, her understudy must take her place.

146
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:09,993
Thanks, everyone, but I can't.

147
00:14:10,573 --> 00:14:14,303
If I go on stage, I'll only bring disgrace to Fantasia.

148
00:14:15,023 --> 00:14:21,133
Not as Geum Roo Na's sister or Choi Yeong Ja's daughter, but do it as Geum Ni Na, the ballerina.

149
00:14:23,293 --> 00:14:27,133
  I would like for it to be you.  

150
00:14:34,963 --> 00:14:37,163
Ni Na should do it.

151
00:14:37,163 --> 00:14:39,363
Let's do it together.

152
00:14:41,373 --> 00:14:43,733
  How could you come here?  

153
00:14:44,893 --> 00:14:46,403
How dare you come here?

154
00:14:46,403 --> 00:14:50,713
Butler Jeong, we just came from the police station. For Yeon Seo—

155
00:14:50,713 --> 00:14:55,393
Don't utter my miss' name with that mouth of yours! You have no right.

156
00:14:55,393 --> 00:14:58,933
We came to apologize and to compensate for our sins.

157
00:14:58,933 --> 00:15:04,493
She's still unconscious after her surgery. Do you think saying "I'm sorry" will be enough?

158
00:15:04,493 --> 00:15:06,533
You can't. Just leave.

159
00:15:06,533 --> 00:15:11,223
Where is Yeon Seo's husband? I'll get his permission.

160
00:15:18,603 --> 00:15:22,123
  Did Yeon Seo send you here?  

161
00:15:22,123 --> 00:15:26,123
 I heard you're still insisting you did everything. 

162
00:15:26,123 --> 00:15:28,493
 You can curse me and call me awful. 

163
00:15:28,493 --> 00:15:35,203
 However, no mother in this world can accuse their own child. That's what a parent is. 

164
00:15:35,203 --> 00:15:37,173
 I'm sure you couldn't believe it at first. 

165
00:15:37,173 --> 00:15:43,253
 Did you blame yourself as a bad parent for not teaching her well? 

166
00:15:43,253 --> 00:15:46,853
 After that, you must have decided to act as a noble parent 

167
00:15:46,853 --> 00:15:52,783
 by comforting her, covering up for her, and claiming it was your wrongdoing.  

168
00:15:54,483 --> 00:16:01,603
  No. Everything from the beginning until now has been all wrong.  

169
00:16:01,603 --> 00:16:07,683
 If you were really a good parent, you would have made her pay the price herself. 

170
00:16:11,463 --> 00:16:14,923
 If you apologize, you'll be given a new opportunity. 

171
00:16:14,923 --> 00:16:18,193
 Humans are given new opportunities. 

172
00:16:18,193 --> 00:16:20,313
 But before that, 

173
00:16:22,133 --> 00:16:24,883
  apologize to Yeon Seo.  

174
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:28,543
 Make sure you apologize as if your life depended on it. 

175
00:16:40,763 --> 00:16:43,213
Hurry and get up.

176
00:16:43,213 --> 00:16:47,703
Get up, and tell me you won't forgive me.

177
00:16:48,613 --> 00:16:52,263
Say that you won't ever let it slide.

178
00:16:52,263 --> 00:16:57,773
Let me be punished while you watch.

179
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:04,393
Quickly get up so that you can do that. Okay?

180
00:17:04,393 --> 00:17:09,503
Yeon Seo, you can hear me. Right?

181
00:17:10,383 --> 00:17:13,243
I came to apologize.

182
00:17:13,243 --> 00:17:16,293
We have done

183
00:17:17,273 --> 00:17:20,883
some irreparable things to you.

184
00:17:20,883 --> 00:17:23,663
I'm sorry, Yeon Seo.

185
00:17:24,613 --> 00:17:27,803
I was wrong.

186
00:17:27,803 --> 00:17:32,333
We came too late.

187
00:17:34,543 --> 00:17:38,323
Yeon Seo, I'm sorry.

188
00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:01,563
Let's go.

189
00:18:15,493 --> 00:18:17,663
You heard, right?

190
00:18:18,943 --> 00:18:22,043
Now you just have to wake up.

191
00:18:25,213 --> 00:18:27,713
Right now, Miss...

192
00:18:28,403 --> 00:18:32,633
should be dancing on the stage beautifully. What's this?

193
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:35,863
It's so terribly upsetting.

194
00:18:45,153 --> 00:18:47,523
Excuse me!

195
00:18:47,523 --> 00:18:49,483
What is it? Are you going to testify?

196
00:18:49,483 --> 00:18:52,653
Can you check if there was a Fantasia performance or not today?

197
00:18:52,653 --> 00:18:54,223
I'm not your secretary.

198
00:18:54,223 --> 00:18:56,443
Please!

199
00:19:00,293 --> 00:19:03,973
"Despite the disturbing incident at Fantasia,

200
00:19:03,973 --> 00:19:06,593
their show, "Giselle," ended successfully."

201
00:19:06,593 --> 00:19:09,333
Who's doing "Giselle"? Who got the part?

202
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:15,543
"As for the role of Giselle, Ms. Geum Ni Na gave the best performance of her career."

203
00:19:17,063 --> 00:19:20,063
We got a happy ending.

204
00:19:20,063 --> 00:19:22,393
Can you show me the video? Please?

205
00:19:22,393 --> 00:19:25,443
I have to see my Ni Na's dance.

206
00:19:32,773 --> 00:19:38,363
 Ballerina Geum Ni Na who gave her best performance declared her retirement. 

207
00:19:38,363 --> 00:19:42,813
Ballerina Geum Ni Na will take moral responsibility for her family's actions,

208
00:19:42,813 --> 00:19:48,103
and she said she will never perform on stage again.

209
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,633
No.

210
00:19:49,633 --> 00:19:51,863
No, no. No, Ni Na!

211
00:19:51,863 --> 00:19:54,233
No, no, no!

212
00:19:54,233 --> 00:19:56,043
No.

227
00:21:21,933 --> 00:21:26,833
How disappointing. It feels pointless.

228
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:29,193
She fought every single day.

229
00:21:29,193 --> 00:21:33,803
Every minute, every second of her life was a battle,

230
00:21:33,803 --> 00:21:36,283
but look at her now.

231
00:21:37,613 --> 00:21:39,583
She'll get up.

232
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:42,463
We know that she's extraordinary.

233
00:21:49,443 --> 00:21:51,813
Here, take this.

234
00:21:55,923 --> 00:22:02,153
Her doctor said that he wouldn't be surprised if she died at any moment.

235
00:22:02,153 --> 00:22:06,363
Her brain was severely damaged because of her cardiac arrest during the surgery.

236
00:22:06,363 --> 00:22:10,693
Even if she wakes up, she may not recover.

237
00:22:13,043 --> 00:22:17,833
It looks like she still struggles every day.

238
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:23,073
She's trying to hold onto the fire of life that's about to burn out.

239
00:22:23,073 --> 00:22:25,863
It looks like she's waiting.

240
00:22:27,703 --> 00:22:31,833
You haven't been able to contact Mr. Dan either, have you?

241
00:22:35,113 --> 00:22:37,643
Yes, I haven't seen him since that day.

242
00:22:39,203 --> 00:22:42,453
That jerk. Heartless man.

243
00:22:42,453 --> 00:22:45,713
How can he leave Miss and run away?

244
00:22:45,713 --> 00:22:49,943
I clearly warned him. Why did he marry her if he was going to run away?

245
00:22:49,943 --> 00:22:54,873
He must have something urgent to do somewhere.

246
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,873
It must be against his will.

247
00:22:57,873 --> 00:23:01,643
I mean, then he should've contacted us.

248
00:23:01,643 --> 00:23:05,103
Miss is struggling to live every day.

249
00:23:22,123 --> 00:23:23,653
Is this...

250
00:23:23,653 --> 00:23:25,283
Miss' blood.

251
00:23:25,283 --> 00:23:29,333
I couldn't just leave it that way. So horrible.

252
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:35,953
This foolish girl danced on stage after wrapping herself in bandages.

253
00:23:49,093 --> 00:23:52,413
He definitely dissipated in front of me.

254
00:24:07,493 --> 00:24:09,533

255
00:24:10,653 --> 00:24:12,573

Did you sleep well?

261
00:24:33,883 --> 00:24:36,103
You're alive.

Where should we go?

268
00:25:00,313 --> 00:25:03,443
Home. I want to go home.
