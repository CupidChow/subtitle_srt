1
00:00:00,633 --> 00:00:06,633


2
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:22,333
What's with your face? Did you cry?

3
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:35,833
Why? What happened?

4
00:00:37,633 --> 00:00:39,833
Nothing happened.

5
00:00:40,633 --> 00:00:42,133
It's just...

6
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:48,233
I really missed you.

7
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:56,033
Me too. I also missed you.

8
00:01:02,633 --> 00:01:06,233
 I want to become a human. 

9
00:01:07,633 --> 00:01:11,833
 Is that possible? 

10
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:34,433
He will disappear like dust, like powder.

11
00:01:35,433 --> 00:01:36,233
Why?

12
00:01:36,233 --> 00:01:41,033
God is very jealous. He doesn't like having what's His taken away by others.

13
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:45,833
Kim Dan will be extinguished

14
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:48,033
because you love him.

15
00:01:49,033 --> 00:01:51,833
That's a lie. Don't lie to me.

16
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:54,633
I know you won't believe

17
00:01:54,633 --> 00:01:56,633
any of this.

18
00:01:58,033 --> 00:01:59,633
How do you know?

19
00:01:59,633 --> 00:02:03,333
I know you're lying to scare me. You want me to break up with Dan.

20
00:02:06,033 --> 00:02:07,633
I can just go to the cathedral to check.

21
00:02:07,633 --> 00:02:11,033
If I ask that Senior, he'll be able to tell me with more certainty.

22
00:02:22,033 --> 00:02:26,833
Now do you understand how I know

23
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:28,833
so much about Kim Dan?

24
00:02:32,633 --> 00:02:34,433
     

25
00:02:35,233 --> 00:02:38,233
♫  The lives we play behind the mask  ♫

26
00:02:38,233 --> 00:02:44,233
♫  A constant rain of pain  ♫

27
00:02:44,233 --> 00:02:50,233
♫  Our minds belong to those who ask  ♫

28
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,433
What are you planning to do?

29
00:02:53,433 --> 00:02:54,833
It's not your business.

30
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:57,833
If you can't have it, you'd rather destroy it? Is that what you are doing?

31
00:02:58,433 --> 00:02:59,633
Think however you wish.

32
00:02:59,633 --> 00:03:01,033
You said you wanted to live.

33
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:04,233
But if you ruin your will to live, you will also die.

34
00:03:06,033 --> 00:03:07,833
I'm doing this to live.

35
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:10,033
I didn't know anything.

36
00:03:10,033 --> 00:03:11,633
If I had known early on.

37
00:03:11,633 --> 00:03:15,633
If someone had told me beforehand,

38
00:03:15,633 --> 00:03:20,033
I wouldn't have gone to the cathedral with Seori.

39
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:23,133
Even if I had to give up on God, I would have gone by myself.

40
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:29,833
So you want to protect Yeon Seo.

41
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:34,633
Just like you want to protect Kim Dan.

42
00:04:08,233 --> 00:04:11,933
It was all for your sake.

43
00:04:13,133 --> 00:04:18,433
But if you leave me, what will I do?

44
00:04:18,433 --> 00:04:20,733
Don't make an excuse.

45
00:04:22,233 --> 00:04:24,033
Don't make me your excuse.

46
00:04:24,033 --> 00:04:26,633
I know it's because you don't want Fantasia taken away from you.

47
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:30,433
And you use me as an excuse? It's all because of your greed.

48
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:36,233
Can you accept that it's not yours?

49
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:38,233
You shouldn't have been like that.

50
00:04:38,233 --> 00:04:40,033
If you really thought of me,

51
00:04:40,033 --> 00:04:43,133
you wouldn't have done that as a mother.

52
00:04:44,733 --> 00:04:46,833
Live like a nice person?

53
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,633
Everything will come back to you?

54
00:04:48,633 --> 00:04:49,633
Ni Na.

55
00:04:49,633 --> 00:04:53,633
If it's all because of me, then I'll disappear.

56
00:04:53,633 --> 00:04:55,633
That will do then.

57
00:05:06,433 --> 00:05:07,833
Ni Na!

58
00:05:09,933 --> 00:05:13,233
I heard from Mom. Yeon Seo came over.

59
00:05:15,433 --> 00:05:18,233
Sis, you didn't know, right?

60
00:05:18,233 --> 00:05:21,133
About Mom and Dad's evil deeds?

61
00:05:21,983 --> 00:05:24,623
Tell me that you didn't know.

62
00:05:24,633 --> 00:05:26,333
Let's go in.

63
00:05:27,433 --> 00:05:32,233
When did I ask for someone to die? Something so awful as that.

64
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:36,033
Did you really never ask for that?

65
00:05:36,933 --> 00:05:39,433
What do you mean?

66
00:05:39,443 --> 00:05:41,423
When Yeon Seo came back,

67
00:05:41,433 --> 00:05:44,733
did you really never wish for her to die?

68
00:05:45,433 --> 00:05:48,833
When Yeon Seo went blind, you were happy.

69
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,333
Is that not true?

70
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:55,533
- That's— 
 - Look into your heart.

71
00:05:55,533 --> 00:05:59,633
You have been standing in that spot because of Yeon Seo's misfortunes.

72
00:05:59,633 --> 00:06:03,533
We just fulfilled the things that you wanted.

73
00:06:04,633 --> 00:06:08,033
So, don't make a fuss and come in.

74
00:06:25,233 --> 00:06:28,033
     

75
00:06:28,033 --> 00:06:30,233
A person who feels thirsty will dig for a well.

76
00:06:30,233 --> 00:06:34,633
There must be another way.

77
00:06:36,233 --> 00:06:37,833
Okay.

78
00:06:41,383 --> 00:06:42,913
Who...

79
00:06:44,033 --> 00:06:45,633
Yeon Seo?

80
00:06:53,533 --> 00:06:55,933
I couldn't sleep.

81
00:07:01,383 --> 00:07:04,143
Were you doing something?

82
00:07:08,433 --> 00:07:09,633
Yeah, studying.

83
00:07:09,633 --> 00:07:12,433
I'll leave if I'm interrupting.

84
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:15,033
Come in. Come in.

85
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:21,633
Do you want to lie down?

86
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:23,833
I mean, it's kind of weird? What should I do?

87
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:26,633
Should I change the quilt—

88
00:07:26,633 --> 00:07:30,233
So, I mean...

89
00:07:30,233 --> 00:07:33,833
Don't concern yourself with me and continue with what you were doing.

90
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:36,033
Oh. Okay.

91
00:08:10,433 --> 00:08:11,833
Dan.

92
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,633
Come here.

93
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:21,633
I want to touch you.

94
00:08:28,533 --> 00:08:31,033
Why? Are you curious?

95
00:08:31,033 --> 00:08:33,633
It's so warm.

96
00:08:38,233 --> 00:08:40,533
Kong-kong, kong-kong.

97
00:08:41,993 --> 00:08:43,603
It's beating.

98
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:47,633
  Kim Dan will dissipate  

99
00:08:47,633 --> 00:08:50,233
  because of your love.  

100
00:08:50,233 --> 00:08:53,233
 You're going to disappear? 

101
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,613
My shell is human.

102
00:08:56,633 --> 00:09:01,833
Because this shell has a defect, wings come out and scars get healed.

103
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:05,833
I'm usually just like any normal male.

104
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:09,233
I also run out of breath and get sweaty.

105
00:09:23,533 --> 00:09:25,133
Thank you.

106
00:09:26,273 --> 00:09:28,873
For showing me your weakness like this.

107
00:09:30,033 --> 00:09:31,633
Thank you.

108
00:09:32,433 --> 00:09:36,933
Even if you act strong,

109
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:40,633
you're very tender and gentle.

110
00:09:44,433 --> 00:09:46,433
Everything will work out.

111
00:09:46,433 --> 00:09:50,433
I mean, the board meeting tomorrow and the Giselle performance.

112
00:09:51,233 --> 00:09:54,633
And you and me.

113
00:10:16,203 --> 00:10:19,983
Thank you for coming out on such short notice.

114
00:10:20,723 --> 00:10:23,763
I have an important announcement to make.

115
00:10:23,763 --> 00:10:27,043
From now on, Team Leader Choi Yeong Ja, Vice-Captain Geum Roo Na, and

116
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:30,803
President Geum Gi Cheon will be stepping down from their positions.

117
00:10:33,893 --> 00:10:35,693
What is the reason?

118
00:10:35,693 --> 00:10:39,033
The reason for the whole family quitting altogether—

119
00:10:52,383 --> 00:10:58,193
Yeon Seo, let me make my farewell.

120
00:11:23,553 --> 00:11:25,393
I am Choi Yeong Ja.

121
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:30,743
I only worked to improve Fantasia all this time.

122
00:11:30,743 --> 00:11:34,213
At first, I was clumsy and often lacking,

123
00:11:34,213 --> 00:11:39,113
but I am not ashamed of my decade of passion.

124
00:11:39,113 --> 00:11:43,813
To all of you supporting me for a long time,

125
00:11:43,813 --> 00:11:46,223
I'd like to say goodbye—

126
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:03,913
Wait. What is this?

127
00:12:03,913 --> 00:12:09,623
CEO Geum Gi Cheon intervened in the cornea donation of Lee Yeon Seo?

128
00:12:13,073 --> 00:12:17,613
Who... did what?

129
00:12:37,573 --> 00:12:39,973
I am the one who is behind all of it.

130
00:12:39,973 --> 00:12:42,643
Interfering with Lee Yeon Seo's cornea donations and

131
00:12:42,643 --> 00:12:45,433
the death of her secretary,

132
00:12:45,433 --> 00:12:47,733
were all my doing.

133
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:50,413
I will receive my punishment.

134
00:12:51,903 --> 00:12:55,663
- Wait a minute. 
 - Please tell us one more thing.

135
00:12:55,663 --> 00:13:00,073
Fantasia Foundation Director Lee intervened in a cornea donation and is a suspect in the murders of two people?

136
00:13:00,073 --> 00:13:01,803
Then what's happening with our ballet?

137
00:13:01,803 --> 00:13:03,743
No way it will crumble, will it?

138
00:13:03,743 --> 00:13:05,963
That can't happen.

139
00:13:06,903 --> 00:13:08,993
Don't worry.

140
00:13:11,943 --> 00:13:18,023
Everyone must have been startled. I tried to take care of it quietly but it came out like this.

141
00:13:18,023 --> 00:13:22,953
It's just a process for things to go back to their places, so please wait and don't get stirred up.

142
00:13:22,953 --> 00:13:27,523
Fantasia won't crumble over this. I promise.

143
00:13:27,523 --> 00:13:29,093
What if we lose the sponsors?

144
00:13:29,093 --> 00:13:32,323
What if they want a refund because of an ugly rumor about our ballet team?

145
00:13:32,323 --> 00:13:34,553
Don't worry about things that haven't occurred.

146
00:13:34,553 --> 00:13:38,573
All of the performances I conducted so far were definitely the best.

147
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:44,783
Let's quit here today, and we'll resume practice when things settle a bit.

148
00:13:50,753 --> 00:13:52,953
The corps was quite nervous.

149
00:13:52,953 --> 00:13:56,033
This is why I wanted to take care of it quietly.

150
00:14:07,633 --> 00:14:11,003
Yeon Seo, let's have a talk.

151
00:14:36,703 --> 00:14:38,563
I did wrong.

152
00:14:38,563 --> 00:14:40,423
What are you planning this time?

153
00:14:40,423 --> 00:14:43,953
Whether it was an act or favor, it should have been done.

154
00:14:43,953 --> 00:14:46,113
That shouldn't have happened.

155
00:14:46,113 --> 00:14:49,713
I was standing on this side before I realized it.

156
00:14:49,713 --> 00:14:53,373
I really regret it. I'm sorry, Yeon Seo.

157
00:14:55,913 --> 00:14:58,983
What should I do to console your heart?

158
00:14:58,983 --> 00:15:01,773
If you ask me to die in front of you, I'll do it.

159
00:15:03,973 --> 00:15:06,723
Please forgive us.

160
00:15:06,723 --> 00:15:09,403
That way, you can rest in peace.

161
00:15:09,403 --> 00:15:11,813
Ah, that was it.

162
00:15:11,813 --> 00:15:14,093
If that was your business, then I don't have anything else to say.

163
00:15:14,093 --> 00:15:17,193
- Yeon Seo. 
 - You are barking up the wrong tree.

164
00:15:17,993 --> 00:15:20,003
Why should I forgive you?

165
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:23,063
I wasn't the one who died on that bridge. It was Mr. Seung Wan.

166
00:15:23,063 --> 00:15:28,373
It wasn't me but Mr. Moon Ji Woong who got killed after gathering his courage to tell the truth.

167
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,503
Those people died.

168
00:15:34,883 --> 00:15:39,203
Because I can't do it even if I want to, I'm asking you...

169
00:15:40,623 --> 00:15:45,673
It was all done by Uncle? You couldn't help it?

170
00:15:45,673 --> 00:15:48,823
Drop it. I know it's you. I know all about it.

171
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:06,633
It's over for our family.

172
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:09,583
It's completely ruined.

173
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:11,733
Let's end it right here.

174
00:16:11,733 --> 00:16:14,703
What's the use of sending a 60-year old man to prison?

175
00:16:14,703 --> 00:16:19,083
It seems like you are trying to avoid the punishment for your own crimes.

176
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:24,203
Perpetrators always make a fuss to their victims why they can't get forgiveness

177
00:16:24,203 --> 00:16:26,783
as if they themselves are the victims.

178
00:16:29,023 --> 00:16:31,923
Unni, cooperate during your interrogation.

179
00:16:31,923 --> 00:16:34,693
There won't be a settlement or forgiveness.

180
00:16:38,963 --> 00:16:41,253
It must be because of Ni Na.

181
00:16:41,253 --> 00:16:45,363
Because she's your sister. Because you love her.

182
00:16:48,823 --> 00:16:55,013
But I am also your cousin. I'm your family.

183
00:16:55,013 --> 00:16:57,033
What is there in a family?

184
00:16:57,033 --> 00:17:00,973
We are just bodies of a unit formed coincidently.

185
00:17:08,063 --> 00:17:10,613
It's fun because you know everything.

186
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:13,723
You go ahead and proceed with your plan.

187
00:17:13,723 --> 00:17:17,913
That'll make it more interesting for me.

188
00:17:22,663 --> 00:17:24,493
Be careful.

189
00:17:48,253 --> 00:17:53,293
Are you still dreaming? The dream of becoming a human?

190
00:17:54,563 --> 00:17:58,723
Don't worry. I will never put Yeon Seo at risk.

191
00:17:58,723 --> 00:18:03,063
That's a relief that you understand. Give up the right way.

192
00:18:04,213 --> 00:18:06,223
I never said I'm giving up.

193
00:18:06,223 --> 00:18:10,113
He definitely has plans for us, Yeon Seo and me.

194
00:18:10,113 --> 00:18:12,183
I'm going to find them.

195
00:18:12,913 --> 00:18:18,983
Also, there must be a reason why we met you.

196
00:18:20,313 --> 00:18:21,013
What do you mean?

197
00:18:21,013 --> 00:18:25,203
I mean there's God's divine plan for you, too.

198
00:18:41,033 --> 00:18:41,993
What is this?

199
00:18:41,993 --> 00:18:44,833
We must practice. What are we going to do at home?

200
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:47,543
Our bodies get stiff if we rest too long.

201
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:51,283
Director, you said you would take care of today's matters.

202
00:18:51,283 --> 00:18:54,673
You'll make us the best, you said. I want to become the  best, too.

203
00:18:54,673 --> 00:18:58,983
Me too. I like Giselle. We'll do well.

204
00:19:01,283 --> 00:19:04,073
Warm up for the first 20 minutes

205
00:19:04,073 --> 00:19:07,223
for Wille's scene. I will check up on you for all the details down to the angle of your fingers.

206
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:16,863
Did you find where Gi Joon Soo is?

207
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:20,783
Not yet. He's probably lying low, trying not to get caught.

208
00:19:20,783 --> 00:19:25,243
We must catch him quick. Geum Roo Na felt like she was filled with evil.

209
00:19:25,243 --> 00:19:27,803
I never thought she would reflect on her actions right away.

210
00:19:27,803 --> 00:19:32,303
Evil tends to last to the end and be defeated in an ugly way.

211
00:19:32,303 --> 00:19:35,393
 Dan, take good care of Yeon Seo. 

212
00:19:35,393 --> 00:19:37,953
 I'll go after sweet-talking the reporters. 

213
00:19:37,953 --> 00:19:39,603
Okay.

214
00:19:45,323 --> 00:19:47,793
Why are you acting tough?

215
00:19:49,293 --> 00:19:53,823
Who? Me? That's not it.

216
00:19:55,413 --> 00:19:59,193
Your own family tried to harm you.

217
00:19:59,193 --> 00:20:02,793
It's natural for your heart to be broken.

218
00:20:02,793 --> 00:20:07,783
I told you. You can show me your weak side.

219
00:20:07,783 --> 00:20:12,063
Those people are no longer my family.

220
00:20:12,063 --> 00:20:17,203
I only have Butler Jeong and you.

221
00:20:18,563 --> 00:20:23,793
Lee Yeon Seo, you are rich. You've got two people who won't betray you for a lifetime.

222
00:20:24,713 --> 00:20:26,203
Forever...

223
00:20:27,853 --> 00:20:31,633
Dan, there's a place I want to go with you.

224
00:20:32,703 --> 00:20:35,373
♫   A one, two, three, four   ♫  

225
00:20:35,373 --> 00:20:38,303
Where do you want to go?

226
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:41,883
      
 I want to do this with you.

227
00:20:41,883 --> 00:20:43,773
You want to do this?

228
00:20:43,773 --> 00:20:44,943
Yeah, let's go in.

229
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:46,573
♫   you rescued me ♫ 

230
00:20:46,573 --> 00:20:47,843
How are you going to do this?

231
00:20:47,843 --> 00:20:49,033
I also

232
00:20:49,033 --> 00:20:50,573
am not so sure.

233
00:20:50,573 --> 00:20:52,303
You've never done this?

234
00:20:52,303 --> 00:20:56,963
I studied abroad in Russia at 12 years old, and I didn't have time to play around.

235
00:20:56,963 --> 00:20:59,503
That's because you probably didn't have any friends because of your temper.

236
00:20:59,503 --> 00:21:02,123
You had Ni Na.

237
00:21:02,123 --> 00:21:03,633
Yeah.

238
00:21:03,633 --> 00:21:05,183
- Oh? 
  - It's time to take a picture. 

239
00:21:05,183 --> 00:21:07,743
 Please look at the lens in the front. 

240
00:21:07,743 --> 00:21:09,573
Where? Is this it?

241
00:21:09,573 --> 00:21:11,843
Oh, this is it, this is it.

242
00:21:11,843 --> 00:21:13,873
What? It took a picture already?

243
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:16,143
♫  Sweet day  ♫

244
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,833
♫   Something to show ♫ 

245
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:21,433
♫   Show that you love me ♫ 

246
00:21:21,433 --> 00:21:23,283
♫   I want something ♫ 

247
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:25,983
What is this? Wow.

248
00:21:25,983 --> 00:21:28,493
It really came out. How interesting.

249
00:21:28,493 --> 00:21:30,373
♫   Something to show ♫ 

250
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:33,003
Until you become an old granny much later,

251
00:21:33,003 --> 00:21:35,223
the photo will remain. Right?

252
00:21:41,623 --> 00:21:45,183
Since it's cheap, I'm sure it will wear out quickly.

253
00:21:45,183 --> 00:21:47,603
Then, what are we going to do?

254
00:21:47,603 --> 00:21:50,883
We just have to take a picture every year and every season.

255
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:57,023
♫  As if by chance, my heart that stopped beating   ♫

256
00:21:57,023 --> 00:22:00,403
This time, let's take really funny pictures. Want to?

257
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:05,193
What are you going to do?

258
00:22:05,193 --> 00:22:07,103
It really suits you.

259
00:22:07,103 --> 00:22:08,303
This is not the way you put it on.

260
00:22:08,303 --> 00:22:09,773
Then, how do you put it on?

261
00:22:09,773 --> 00:22:14,953
♫  Slowly come closer to me  ♫

262
00:22:14,953 --> 00:22:20,613
♫  My love, my love, my love  ♫

263
00:22:22,443 --> 00:22:28,093
♫  You never leave my mind  ♫

264
00:22:28,093 --> 00:22:31,813
♫  Even my naive  ♫

265
00:22:31,813 --> 00:22:36,753
♫  difficult love  ♫

266
00:22:36,753 --> 00:22:41,543
 By any chance, you thought an angel would stay here forever? 

267
00:22:41,543 --> 00:22:45,483
 Like dust, like powder, 

268
00:22:45,483 --> 00:22:47,853
 he'll disappear 

269
00:22:47,853 --> 00:22:49,183
 because you love him. 

270
00:22:49,183 --> 00:22:53,123
♫  You never leave my mind  ♫

271
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:01,703
What is this? What do you not like?

272
00:23:03,243 --> 00:23:07,223
Should I not do this either? What should I do?

273
00:23:07,223 --> 00:23:09,613
Don't disappear.

274
00:23:13,153 --> 00:23:15,863
Can't you not die?

275
00:23:20,343 --> 00:23:22,203
How did you know?

276
00:23:22,203 --> 00:23:27,193
You don't even have a month left, and when it ends you'll

277
00:23:27,193 --> 00:23:33,043
disappear like dust.

278
00:23:40,013 --> 00:23:42,183
I'm not going to disappear.

279
00:23:42,183 --> 00:23:44,603
How can I leave you alone?

280
00:23:46,173 --> 00:23:48,143
Really?

281
00:23:53,523 --> 00:23:56,443
Yeon Seo, listen carefully.

282
00:23:56,443 --> 00:24:00,973
I will become human.

283
00:24:01,693 --> 00:24:04,263
Human?

284
00:24:04,263 --> 00:24:07,983
I will become a real human.

285
00:24:07,983 --> 00:24:11,493
I sent a report to Heaven and prayed.

286
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:15,543
Although I haven't received a definite approval yet,

287
00:24:15,543 --> 00:24:17,613
I will continue to appeal.

288
00:24:17,613 --> 00:24:20,653
Do you trust me? Lee Yeon Seo?

289
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:32,013
Goodness, Noisy Gong.

290
00:24:32,013 --> 00:24:34,773
So that's what made you cry?

291
00:24:36,573 --> 00:24:38,853
You should have told me.

292
00:24:38,853 --> 00:24:43,003
Why were you worried about it all alone?

293
00:25:11,883 --> 00:25:13,143
What the hell are you doing?

294
00:25:13,143 --> 00:25:15,033
Let's say you are thankful.

295
00:25:15,033 --> 00:25:19,393
I understand what you said. I promised you that I would never hurt Yeon Seo.

296
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:21,753
Why did you tell Yeon Seo about it?

297
00:25:22,713 --> 00:25:25,473
She's crying because of you.

298
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:31,533
(I told her so that she could) run away. (She should) run away with all her might.

299
00:25:31,533 --> 00:25:34,703
But that's not going to happen.

300
00:25:34,703 --> 00:25:37,613
Lee Yeon Seo is silly.

301
00:25:38,533 --> 00:25:40,113
I'm warning you.

302
00:25:40,113 --> 00:25:44,443
Don't you dare even open your mouth about that life-sacrificing or nonsense to Yeon Seo.

303
00:25:44,443 --> 00:25:47,663
I won't leave you alone if I hear that.

304
00:25:47,663 --> 00:25:50,003
Do you understand?

305
00:25:50,003 --> 00:25:51,973
You will turn out like me.

306
00:25:51,973 --> 00:25:57,033
If God is fair, you will be destroyed like me.

307
00:26:02,643 --> 00:26:07,583
If I was scared of being destroyed, I wouldn't have returned.

308
00:26:22,443 --> 00:26:26,443
     

309
00:26:27,053 --> 00:26:30,813
     

310
00:26:42,623 --> 00:26:45,353
     

311
00:26:48,383 --> 00:26:50,443
Yes. This is Ji Kang Woo.

312
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:52,843
I have a question.

313
00:26:52,843 --> 00:26:58,013
You are not an angel right now, right?

314
00:26:58,013 --> 00:26:58,813
What about it?

315
00:26:58,813 --> 00:27:02,893
That design on the handkerchief turned black on the feather.

316
00:27:02,893 --> 00:27:04,913
Right?

317
00:27:04,913 --> 00:27:08,083
How did you become human?

318
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:10,863
Is it possible for Dan to become human?

319
00:27:29,243 --> 00:27:31,753
There is no method for that. Please give it up.

320
00:27:31,753 --> 00:27:33,923
Why? You became human.

321
00:27:33,923 --> 00:27:36,763
Tell me. please?

322
00:27:36,763 --> 00:27:42,493
For 15 years after I became human, I was constantly unhappy.

323
00:27:42,493 --> 00:27:46,113
 Every minute, constantly. 

324
00:27:46,113 --> 00:27:49,463
Kim Dan will also end up like me.

325
00:27:49,463 --> 00:27:54,183
Do you want to give that hell to him?

326
00:28:32,693 --> 00:28:35,023
 Yeon Seo found out 

327
00:28:35,023 --> 00:28:39,253
 that if I fail the mission, I will dissipate. 

328
00:28:39,253 --> 00:28:43,493
 Are you really not going to respond? 

329
00:28:43,493 --> 00:28:45,823
 I don't have much time. 

330
00:28:51,083 --> 00:28:55,953
♫  Silence calms me down  ♫

331
00:28:55,953 --> 00:29:00,833
♫  And it made long-lost warmth returned to me  ♫

332
00:29:00,833 --> 00:29:02,403
♫  like a miracle  ♫

333
00:29:02,403 --> 00:29:04,743
You're going to reject it

334
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:10,553
without even looking?

335
00:29:10,553 --> 00:29:14,593
♫  ...gently flutters my heart  ♫

336
00:29:14,593 --> 00:29:20,413
♫  Like a stranger in empty streets  ♫

337
00:29:20,413 --> 00:29:23,573
♫  I wander back and forth   ♫

338
00:29:23,573 --> 00:29:27,453
 Please respond. I want to become human. 

339
00:29:28,893 --> 00:29:33,483
♫  After a the tired hearts   ♫

340
00:29:33,483 --> 00:29:36,173
It's okay. I can write it again.

341
00:29:36,173 --> 00:29:39,023
I can even write a hundred or two hundred letters.

342
00:29:39,023 --> 00:29:43,913
♫   ...is silently   ♫

343
00:29:43,913 --> 00:29:48,393
 Please respond. I want to become human. 

344
00:29:48,393 --> 00:29:53,033
♫  Our memories stopped    ♫

345
00:29:53,033 --> 00:29:58,433
 Please respond. I want to become human. 

346
00:29:58,523 --> 00:30:01,703
 Please respond. I want to become human. 

347
00:30:01,703 --> 00:30:06,473
♫   ...brilliantly like a   ♫

348
00:30:06,473 --> 00:30:09,303
♫   gleaming shining light   ♫

349
00:30:09,303 --> 00:30:12,053
 Please respond. I want to become human. 

350
00:30:12,053 --> 00:30:15,603
 Please respond. I want to become human. 

351
00:30:15,603 --> 00:30:18,973
 Please respond. I want to become human. 

352
00:30:23,853 --> 00:30:25,503
Kim Dan,

353
00:30:25,503 --> 00:30:29,383
did He reply? The reply...

354
00:30:29,383 --> 00:30:31,893
     

355
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:36,913
Yes, Miss Yeon Seo, are you awake?

356
00:30:36,913 --> 00:30:40,993
Come to the living room in 30 minutes. We're going on a picnic.

357
00:30:40,993 --> 00:30:42,403
Now?

358
00:30:42,403 --> 00:30:46,323
It's a formal date so dress nicely.

359
00:30:47,113 --> 00:30:49,253
Date?

360
00:30:52,043 --> 00:30:54,403
Date. Date.

361
00:30:55,623 --> 00:31:02,563


362
00:31:06,153 --> 00:31:08,073
I need to wash up.
