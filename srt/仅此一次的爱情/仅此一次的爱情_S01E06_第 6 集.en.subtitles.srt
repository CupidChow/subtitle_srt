1
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:36,930
Just like how I didn't know

2
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:38,640
I would meet you,

3
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,268
find you, and fall in love with you.

4
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,104
Just like

5
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:48,149
how we don't know
what our ending would be.

6
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:22,869
Great job, really.

7
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,875
It took me a long time.

8
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:32,879
I was

9
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,549
lost in a dark and long tunnel

10
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,426
for a long time.

11
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,679
It was so long without an end.

12
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,266
I thought I would never
be able to get out.

13
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:48,686
I finally found

14
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,648
the exit.

15
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:53,942
Finally.

16
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:03,868
Lee Yeon-seo.

17
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,621
Be my Giselle.

18
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,040
Giselle?

19
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,551
Goodness, I got caught.

20
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:32,397
You wanted to come and roll around
on the sandy beach on your day off?

21
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:34,399
I was going to stay quiet,

22
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,527
but the guard post was way too old.

23
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,779
Stop smiling. You're annoying me.

24
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:44,993
What was it like to watch me in secret?

25
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:47,370
I must have looked like a complete fool
to get so easily deceived

26
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,913
to dance around.

27
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:49,998
It was so pretty.

28
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,378
It was really pretty.

29
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,922
This part of my body felt itchy,

30
00:04:58,798 --> 00:04:59,882
and I became sad

31
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,676
and happy.

32
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:05,430
Don't be so cheeky.

33
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:06,848
What do you know about dance?

34
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:08,891
Because I don't know anything,

35
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,436
and because there was nothing I could do,

36
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:13,479
I decided to make this.

37
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,440
I wanted to do something for you,

38
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:16,941
but as you said,

39
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:19,610
I don't know anything about ballet.

40
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,154
Then you should just sit still.

41
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,613
Yes, you're useless.

42
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,032
You can't drive. You can't do judo.

43
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,326
And you get on my nerves
saying I'm too mean.

44
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,493
That's enough.

45
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,120
Stop going behind my back.

46
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,209
Should we go now?

47
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,096
Let's go to Fantasia's Night.

48
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,849
Let's show the sponsors

49
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,476
who the prima ballerina is.

50
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,603
What should I prepare?

51
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,480
A dress that is way too showy?

52
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:56,856
My business smile?

53
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,024
Don't be sarcastic.

54
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,442
You know that this is necessary.

55
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,569
Not all sponsors are perverted

56
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,737
or dirty.

57
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,490
It's the dancer's job to receive attention
and endure it.

58
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,283
Not yours, our outspoken director.

59
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:09,827
Over the ten years
of my life as a director, I never made

60
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:12,371
my ballerinas stand around as flowers.

61
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:13,414
Trust me.

62
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:14,749
No!

63
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:18,753
There's a saying,

64
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,880
"There must not be even
a hint of immorality,

65
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,632
or of any kind of impurity, or of greed."

66
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,093
Hey, you cult member.
What are you talking about?

67
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,470
Don't go. Your dance is more than enough.

68
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,722
There's no reason to prove
yourself any further.

69
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,225
There is no need to bear the wickedness.

70
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,185
Mr. Ji, do you think this is why I--

71
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,481
-Hey.
-You're right.

72
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,775
It could be dirty and uncomfortable.

73
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,276
And it could be worse.

74
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,945
But still, we shouldn't
avoid this, Yeon-seo.

75
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,029
I'll fight with you.

76
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,156
I want to see you become the center

77
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:48,991
of Fantasia.

78
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,915
I'll manage. Mind your business.

79
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,417
Both of you.

80
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,153
Is this what they call a dream?

81
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,285
Goodness!

82
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,164
How did you know about that beach?

83
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,832
Even I couldn't remember,

84
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,292
so how could you?

85
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:48,968
You're smiling brightly, aren't you?

86
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,219
You look pretty.

87
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,014
Can you stop saying that?

88
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:53,931
Are you teasing me?

89
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:57,602
It is said that a useless servant
should do what he can.

90
00:07:58,102 --> 00:07:59,770
I may be useless,

91
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,772
but I will continue to call
something pretty if it is.

92
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,399
Because I can do that.

93
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,487
I'm sorry.

94
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,243
You said you didn't like me.

95
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:16,704
So why are you doing this?

96
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:29,592
YEONHWA ISLAND

97
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,010
THE DAY I STARTED BALLET ONCE AGAIN!

98
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,038
THE MOMENT YOU'VE STEPPED INTO
OUR ACADEMY,

99
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,748
IT'S AS IF YOU'VE ALREADY ACQUIRED
YOUR LICENSE

100
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,166
Your registration has been completed.

101
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,834
Thank you.

102
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,296
Are you Mr. Kim Dan?

103
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,840
-Yes.
-Come over here.

104
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,217
We'll start immediately.

105
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:14,345
Thank you, sir!

106
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:19,934
Brakes!

107
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,727
How many times do I need to repeat myself?

108
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,312
First, belt. Second, brakes.

109
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,313
Third.

110
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:25,982
Third, start the engine!

111
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:26,983
Again.

112
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,150
Brakes.

113
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,361
Start the engine.

114
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,449
We're pretty much crawling.

115
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,744
That's my report!

116
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,538
Wait! Come on!

117
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:41,747
Disqualified.

118
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,627
-Hu!
-What is it?

119
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,713
Are you seriously keeping an eye on me?

120
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:49,755
What?

121
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,842
Can't you see that I'm doing my best

122
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,844
to help you drive here?

123
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,679
Why do I sound like this?

124
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:59,932
I'm trying so hard to help you.

125
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,642
Then you should've told me earlier!

126
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,353
Thanks to you, I'm already disqualified!

127
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:13,154
There. Remember the steps and begin.

128
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,865
How could an angel threaten someone
and adopt an expedient?

129
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:16,991
Begin.

130
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,994
-Fine.
-Are you ready? Begin.

131
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:21,746
-No!
-Hey, hey!

132
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,748
Do it again.

133
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:24,832
Which one's the accelerator?

134
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:27,001
-The right side!
-Here I go.

135
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:28,961
-Good, good!
-Good, good!

136
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,172
-Which one's the brakes?
-Stop!

137
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,257
Make it go back again!

138
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,095
Why is it going this way?

139
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,809
Stop! You did it!

140
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,063
No wonder you always cause trouble.

141
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,939
You're not smart, to begin with.

142
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,193
I'm never going to learn
anything from you!

143
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,320
You little...

144
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,573
Hey, Dan.

145
00:10:58,783 --> 00:10:59,617
Dan!

146
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,370
You're pretty much a human now.

147
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,704
You're actually angry.

148
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,915
You were too harsh! It was my first time!

149
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,416
-Goodness.
-I didn't know anything.

150
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,085
I didn't know what I was doing.

151
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,087
But you shouted and criticized me!

152
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,713
I wasn't happy with what you were doing,

153
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,006
so I wanted you to snap out of it.

154
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,883
Animals were your only clients.

155
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:18,427
I was worried you wouldn't know which way

156
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,263
to lead your human client
and ultimately fail.

157
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,264
What do you mean?

158
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,392
I know this is your first
time dealing with humans.

159
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,060
This is your first time
in a human body too.

160
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:29,814
But still, don't you think
this was a bit too much?

161
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:30,815
Listen to this.

162
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,942
"Lee Yeon-seo danced.

163
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,860
She was beautiful.

164
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,196
It was the prettiest thing

165
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,906
I saw on earth."

166
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,117
She overworked herself.

167
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:42,618
I was scared

168
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:46,038
that she'd suffer and become unhappy.

169
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:50,167
But when she was dancing, her face glowed.

170
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,503
She was definitely happy.

171
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,799
How many times did you mention her?

172
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:57,925
There are 20 lines about her.

173
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:00,886
In the end, you wrote, "She hugged Rib."

174
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,055
It was just that one sentence.

175
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,141
What kind of report is this?

176
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,268
It's the truth!

177
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:09,979
Since we're talking about it,
I have a question.

178
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,064
Do you think he's a strong one?

179
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,190
What are you saying?

180
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:15,484
Her life has just begun!

181
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:20,030
She needs a strong, good rib beside her
for her to become happy.

182
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,452
Could you

183
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,579
look into it for me?

184
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,349
THE LATE CHOI SEOL-HUI

185
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,670
Are you scared?

186
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,464
Well. No.

187
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,467
I'll be with you.

188
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,697
-Kang-woo.
-It's dangerous.

189
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,324
Stay back.

190
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,720
Listen, Angel Raporas.

191
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:11,141
You had received a mission of
inspiring artists

192
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:15,396
so that they would be able to draw things
that would give joy to the deity.

193
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:19,024
However, you betrayed your mission
and even decided to abandon the deity.

194
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,527
Therefore, you will be judged.

195
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,529
I've fulfilled my mission as an angel.

196
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:25,531
From now on,

197
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,784
I'd like to become a muse

198
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:31,620
for one person only.

199
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,679
Becoming an angel,

200
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,598
becoming a human,

201
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,434
starting a life,

202
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:55,644
and ending a life

203
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,106
all depend on the deity's will.

204
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:02,985
Don't come.

205
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,362
Don't come. Please.

206
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:12,953
This is cruel.

207
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:14,997
Then

208
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,166
why did the deity give me a heart?

209
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,709
Giving me a heart

210
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,128
and telling me to overcome my feelings

211
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,173
are the doings of a devil!

212
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,759
I will take everything
that the deity has given

213
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:28,427
from you.

214
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,240
Please, no.

215
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,282
Please.

216
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,910
Please.

217
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,166
Please.

218
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,596
THE LATE CHOI SEOL-HUI

219
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,191
I desperately wanted to become a human,

220
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,027
but not in the world

221
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,321
where you don't exist.

222
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,530
I could neither die

223
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,949
nor live a proper life.

224
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,785
I was lost for 15 years.

225
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:46,959
I think

226
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,838
it will work out really well this time.

227
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:55,801
You must have lost someone dear to you.

228
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,555
I can still see waves
of yearning in your eyes.

229
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,431
As you loved the person
with all of your heart,

230
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,100
I am sure your loved one
will be in paradise.

231
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,270
And I can only assume
that she will be in peace.

232
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,691
Does "peace" really exist?

233
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,485
Living is already a torment.

234
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,779
Wishing to be born again
is a silly thought.

235
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,157
And wishing for peace on the other side

236
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,534
sounds lame, doesn't it?

237
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:24,663
Then,

238
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,500
what is it that you want?

239
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,351
Will you really attend the event?

240
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,938
"If you leave your home,
there will be trouble.

241
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:50,898
Stay at home."

242
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:52,900
That's your horoscope for today.

243
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,401
Doesn't this sound too eerie?

244
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,320
One person warns me with some saying.

245
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:57,946
And the other with my horoscope.

246
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,531
It's because
we don't feel good about this.

247
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,532
Horoscopes are big data

248
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:03,410
that contain the principles of
the universe and human history.

249
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:06,747
-If you ignore it, you'll be in trouble.
-I'll face it.

250
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,832
I probably can't avoid it
even if I want to.

251
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:13,962
Fine.

252
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:15,672
If you're going to attend,

253
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,217
might as well go and announce it
with a bright smile.

254
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,720
"Fantasia belongs to me. This is where
I should be." Make it official.

255
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,014
I'll be out after I get changed.

256
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,516
Okay.

257
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,035
Do you like me?

258
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,870
Just say yes or no.

259
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,415
Did you like me?

260
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,670
Do you?

261
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:59,800
No.

262
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,313
Hello. What would you like?

263
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,357
Something to help me be okay on my own.

264
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,650
-Pardon?
-Relaxing pills,

265
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,402
sedatives, or stimulant drugs.

266
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,112
I don't care what it is.

267
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,364
I've been

268
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,700
relying on people too much.

269
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:28,745
I've been relying on a guy
who doesn't even like me.

270
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:32,416
I'm not the type of person
who easily gets attached.

271
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,670
I must have lost my mind
for a second or something.

272
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,130
Give me some medicine

273
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,048
that will make me be okay
without that jerk.

274
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,433
Darn it.

275
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,477
Gosh.

276
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:07,993
What is he...

277
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,665
Hold on. Get out of the car.

278
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:14,916
I'll move the car for you.

279
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,668
Let me keep trying.

280
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:18,003
Sure.

281
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,513
Behind you. Watch out for the gate.

282
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:31,099
Goodness. You're in my way.

283
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,477
Get out of my way. I'm parking here.

284
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:34,853
Were you really parking?

285
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:36,438
I was keeping a safe distance, you know?

286
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,940
-When did you get your driver's license?
-What are you talking about?

287
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:39,900
Your driver's license...

288
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:41,485
You're not supposed to park your car here.

289
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,473
-Come on.
-Goodness.

290
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:15,811
What is that?
Did you get a driver's license?

291
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,104
Yes.

292
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:19,064
Why don't you ride with me today?

293
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,440
For safety reasons.

294
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:26,905
That would be better.

295
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,870
Welcome, Yeon-seo.

296
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:34,871
Welcome.

297
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:38,166
He is our special guest today.

298
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,669
This is Seiji Ishikawa.

299
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:44,464
Ms. Lee, it's very nice to meet you.

300
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:52,514
Thank you.

301
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:57,561
Have a good time today.

302
00:23:57,894 --> 00:23:58,895
Okay.

303
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:02,774
Why don't you escort Mr. Seiji, Yeon-seo?

304
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:05,110
Mr. Seiji, hello.

305
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:07,195
I'm Fantasia's Artistic Director,
Ji Kang-woo.

306
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,156
-Nice to meet you.
-I see.

307
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,782
Why don't we go in?

308
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:11,950
-Sure.
-Okay.

309
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,036
You're wearing the earrings.

310
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,663
How beautiful. They look great on you.

311
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:20,000
They don't suit my taste, but I'm being
considerate for the one who gave it to me.

312
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:21,835
I'm very grateful.

313
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:24,921
Your attendance at the event means a lot.

314
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:28,049
You will make the official announcement
in front of the sponsors, right?

315
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:29,217
When will you announce it?

316
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,803
I'll announce it as soon as the show ends.

317
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,097
Don't worry, Yeon-seo.

318
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:36,016
Enjoy the event as much as you can.

319
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,661
I'll go check on the dancers.

320
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:57,746
Wait for me here.

321
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:00,123
I'll go inside first.
I can go in by myself.

322
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,249
-No, you can't.
-No.

323
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:05,170
Let me escort you.

324
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:09,090
Do not leave Yeon-seo alone
until I get there. Understood?

325
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,759
Just hurry back.

326
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:23,104
Hey, don't kid yourself.

327
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,940
I can walk just fine without you now.

328
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,359
I know that. I didn't say anything.

329
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:28,818
Let's go.

330
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,554
Check for anything
that could fall around Ms. Lee first.

331
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:57,764
Like lights or anything else.

332
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:08,692
Ms. Lee.

333
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,995
Do you really think someone might be
trying to harm Ms. Lee?

334
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,371
But she's their family.

335
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,164
Think about it.

336
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,333
Think about how the chandelier fell.

337
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:28,295
She was in a car accident.
And the light fell on her.

338
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:31,047
Scary things keep happening to her.

339
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,133
I'm just worried.

340
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:39,848
Attention.

341
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:42,058
Don't get too excited.

342
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,602
-No injuries. Okay?
-Yes, sir.

343
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:45,687
The floor might be slippery.

344
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,689
-Apply a lot of resin.
-Yes, sir.

345
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:50,900
We'll get the sponsors
to donate a lot of money.

346
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,862
We're not here to beg for money.

347
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:55,697
Don't smile to make good impressions.

348
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,324
And don't overdo it
by looking too serious.

349
00:26:57,407 --> 00:27:01,077
Just show them that what we do is worth

350
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:03,288
all the money that they spend. That's all.

351
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,915
Okay? Keep up the good work.

352
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:51,669
It's an honor to meet
the legendary Ms. Lee this close.

353
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,882
Sure. Let us keep this good relationship.

354
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:57,967
What is this?

355
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:01,221
The world-renowned Ms. Lee is next to me,

356
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:03,765
but I can't even hold her hand.

357
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:06,184
I am so sorry.

358
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,646
Instead, choose a girl you like

359
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:12,232
among them.

360
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:16,736
I will

361
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:21,116
take her to you later
for a private meeting.

362
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:27,080
I like the one in the center.

363
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,125
I especially like her thighs.

364
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:33,670
Ballerinas tend to be way too skinny.

365
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:43,054
Ms. Lee, it is such an honor to meet you.

366
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:44,848
Will you please

367
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:49,310
show me a short performance?

368
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,147
That wasn't a part of our plan.

369
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:58,153
You should see that on a good stage.

370
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,491
We'll reserve a VIP seat
for you at her comeback performance.

371
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:04,951
Please interpret that.

372
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:08,496
She just declined.

373
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:12,000
She's being difficult.

374
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,045
If she is truly a genius,

375
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,300
she can surprise everyone
with an improvisation.

376
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:25,263
Not bad at putting up with those rogues.

377
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:35,190
Eat up, Yeon-seo.

378
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,153
Bring what I prepared.

379
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:41,237
Yes.

380
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:54,876
There won't be any security cameras
because it's a private party.

381
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,010
What's important is the people.

382
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,221
Don't miss anyone who looks suspicious.

383
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,688
Who are you? What are you doing here?

384
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:18,566
I was trying to smoke.

385
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:20,318
I'm so sorry.

386
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:24,030
I know smoking is prohibited here,
but my hands began to shake.

387
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,866
No, I'm sorry.

388
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:06,364
Are you nervous

389
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:08,324
to stand in front of the sponsors?

390
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:12,328
I lived all my life
getting attention on stage.

391
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:13,997
Nervous? No way.

392
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,211
What's important is the people.

393
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,255
Don't miss anyone who looks suspicious.

394
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,215
Wait

395
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:34,976
What's going on?

396
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,352
-What happened?
-Why did he fall?

397
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,314
I'm sorry.

398
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:42,233
-What was that?
-Goodness.

399
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,487
What are you doing?

400
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,949
Hey, just leave
before everyone stares at you.

401
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:07,258
Make two more glasses.

402
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:08,426
Hurry!

403
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,276
It's okay. Get back to work.

404
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:28,738
Gwang-il.

405
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,074
Chairman Keum.

406
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:33,242
I was following the order
of the General Director--

407
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,243
I know.

408
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:35,828
But you can't.

409
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:37,080
Never.

410
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,167
You shouldn't hurt a person

411
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,544
no matter who gave you the order.

412
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:10,321
Why isn't he coming?

413
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,115
She'll be making a speech
after that segment.

414
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:14,450
Mr. Park won't come.

415
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:18,079
How did you know?

416
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,336
What is this?

417
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:27,255
A sleeping pill? Sedative?

418
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,174
Were you going to

419
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,802
let Yeon-seo collapse
in front of everyone?

420
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:34,220
I told her that we shouldn't do it.

421
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,222
I told her that it cannot happen.

422
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:38,016
I mean it, Ki-chun.

423
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:04,709
You.

424
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:07,170
How much do you know?

425
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:10,256
You already know
that Mr. Park is a pushover.

426
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,383
Why do you keep taking a risk?

427
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:44,749
Did you all enjoy the performances?

428
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,001
Your precious contribution

429
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:50,129
made Fantasia what it is today.

430
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:53,466
We truly thank you.

431
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:02,058
And now,

432
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:05,061
I would like to make
an important announcement.

433
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:07,688
As of now,

434
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,274
I, Choi Yeong-ja,

435
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,987
who loved Fantasia with all of her heart,

436
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:19,992
who worked as

437
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,371
the General Director of Fantasia,

438
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:24,956
will resign.

439
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:33,256
Let me introduce the lady

440
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:36,008
who will take charge of Fantasia's future.

441
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,596
Please welcome my niece,
whom I love dearly,

442
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:43,724
Lee Yeon-seo, with a round of applause.

443
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:32,064
I was trying to smoke.

444
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,364
You fool!

445
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:42,408
What's going on?

446
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:44,035
My goodness!

447
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:45,703
What did you say?

448
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,455
You can't even hold my hand?

449
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,415
You pervert.

450
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:52,710
You can't differentiate ballet
with pornography?

451
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:55,546
This isn't a brothel, you scumbag!

452
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:58,216
You speak Japanese?

453
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,593
I can even say "scumbag" in French.

454
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:01,719
What are you doing?

455
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,388
My goodness. What is it?

456
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:06,098
-Please!
-You...

457
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:09,143
You ignorant idiots!

458
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,479
Please, I beg you.

459
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:15,650
Could you please
spend your filthy money elsewhere?

460
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,902
You guys make me sick!

461
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,820
You are disgusting!

462
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,531
Please, everyone.

463
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:26,535
Stop acting so sophisticated.

464
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:31,666
Sorry, sir.

465
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:32,708
Let's get out of here.

466
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,085
What's going on?

467
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:36,629
Hey, you pervert!

468
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:43,844
Where are you going?
Let's see what else you are thinking.

469
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:44,845
Wait, Yeon-seo.

470
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:48,349
You Japanese geezer.
You wanted me to dance?

471
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:49,892
Where are you going?

472
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:51,269
Where are you going?

473
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,981
-Where are you going?
-Ms. Lee!

474
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,316
Fine!

475
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,652
I'll show you then.

476
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:01,529
Music!

477
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:33,477
It's you again?

478
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:35,896
Yes.

479
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,315
It's me.

480
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,567
It's always you.

481
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:45,865
You stupid idiot.

482
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:35,748
Don't go.

483
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:39,543
Don't go.

484
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,407
Are you awake?

485
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,414
How did I come home yesterday?

486
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,417
Do you really not remember anything?

487
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,170
You pervert.

488
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:26,590
You can't differentiate ballet
with pornography?

489
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,592
You guys make me sick!

490
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,845
You are disgusting!

491
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,221
Darn it.

492
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:34,932
Where's Dan?

493
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:36,434
He took care of you all night and then

494
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,477
switched with me,
saying he had somewhere to go.

495
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,355
Were you in that much pain
that you had to drink?

496
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,316
Still, you said you'd be careful.

497
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,652
I didn't even finish a glass of wine.

498
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:51,949
Ms. Jung, could you bring me my phone?

499
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:00,749
JI KANG-WOO

500
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,793
Please call Dr. Lee.

501
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:05,421
Are you feeling sick?

502
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,555
Is Lee Yeon-seo out of her mind?

503
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,599
That's why I told you

504
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:17,808
that she was still

505
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,852
physically and mentally unstable.

506
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:23,147
And it seems to be getting worse.

507
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,899
That prima ballerina,

508
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:27,651
chairwoman, or whatever she may be

509
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:30,696
swore in front of us
which was absolutely unforgivable.

510
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,699
But on top of that, are we supposed

511
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:36,702
to condone that young artistic director's
brazen attitude?

512
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:38,913
Are we? Why?

513
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:42,500
Sir, will you please calm down
for my sake, at least?

514
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,168
It's also impressive
how you and your daughter

515
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:45,794
maintained your temporary positions

516
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,923
for so long.

517
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:53,928
That mad heiress will run
this ballet theater and also perform?

518
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,055
Please give me a logical reason

519
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:58,516
why I should invest my precious money

520
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,142
into this preposterous ballet theater.

521
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:04,563
Director Ji, say something.

522
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,493
Do as you please.

523
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:18,577
-What?
-What is he saying?

524
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:20,871
But if you back out now,

525
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:25,042
I won't allow you to become a sponsor
for Giselle.

526
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:28,462
It's a chance for your name to be listed
under Korea's best performance.

527
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:30,089
This is your last chance.

528
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:35,052
Are you telling us not to miss out
on a chance to spend our money?

529
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,101
I will

530
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:44,478
no longer support this ballet theater.

531
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:47,565
I don't know what you all may think.

532
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,733
But our company

533
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:52,486
will cease to do any business

534
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:54,154
that concerns Fantasia.

535
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:17,011
Director Ji.

536
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,810
-How is that possible?
-It's ridiculous.

537
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:26,562
-I can't believe it.
-Hey.

538
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:35,112
A strike?

539
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:37,114
Everyone on that ship saw it.

540
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:39,617
It's ridiculous for her
to become the prima ballerina.

541
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,744
What if she suddenly
acts out while performing a lift?

542
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:43,287
Who will be responsible for her injuries?

543
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:45,039
Are you done?

544
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:47,249
Keum Ni-na.

545
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:49,960
Do you have anything to say?

546
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:52,046
I think it's a problem if the corps

547
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:53,839
cannot acknowledge the prima ballerina.

548
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:57,092
The prima ballerina should be someone
whom everyone can approve of.

549
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:00,929
I'm baffled.

550
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:04,224
I thought Lee Yeon-seo would be the one

551
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:07,603
to bail out, not you people.

552
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:11,023
Are you saying that she's going to quit?

553
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,024
No.

554
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:15,194
I'm talking about performing with you all.

555
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:17,112
I was worried she'd say

556
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:19,782
that she wouldn't be able to perform

557
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:22,034
with such an incompetent corps.

558
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,286
The five who performed Spanish.

559
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,206
Did you know the angles of
your elbows were terrible?

560
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:28,624
Ui-geon.

561
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:30,876
I said not to smile or frown excessively.

562
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:33,337
But you had a stiff face all night long.
Were you at a funeral?

563
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:34,588
Keum Ni-na!

564
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:38,467
You were too focused on keeping the rhythm
that your dance moves were dull.

565
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,886
Yet you talk about acknowledgment
and approval?

566
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:46,600
I couldn't feel anything.

567
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,018
Do you even listen to music?

568
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:49,812
Do you even understand the story?

569
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:53,440
With Yeon-seo, she could
just stand in front of me,

570
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:54,900
and my body would feel electrified.

571
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:55,984
So how?

572
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:59,279
How are all your dance moves

573
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:01,949
so empty?

574
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:03,617
Why?

575
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:15,546
With Yeon-seo,

576
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:20,050
she could just stand in front of me,
and my body would feel electrified.

577
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:21,176
So how?

578
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:24,847
How are all your dance moves

579
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:26,056
so empty?

580
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:27,850
Why?

581
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:36,733
This is awful.

582
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,821
I'm being awful to myself.

583
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:44,158
It's so awful that I'm not Yeon-seo!

584
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,743
What's there to yell about?

585
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:50,038
You're totally wasted in broad daylight.

586
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:00,174
Is that her?

587
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:02,718
Ms. Elena?

588
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:04,636
Ms. Elena!

589
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:07,347
Ms. Elena!

590
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:12,227
Ms. Elena!

591
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:14,646
Ms. Elena.

592
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:16,231
Ms. Elena.

593
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:17,983
Ms. Elena.

594
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:20,110
Ms. Elena!

595
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:23,864
Isn't that you, Ms. Elena?

596
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:26,116
It's me, Ni-na.

597
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:29,953
I learned ballet from you when I was a kid
for the first time. I'm Keum Ni-na!

598
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,331
Get lost!

599
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:33,290
I...

600
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:35,751
I thought about you from time to time.

601
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:37,961
I missed you.

602
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,172
I told you to get lost.

603
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:42,966
A mere mention of Fantasia disgusts me.

604
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,551
It makes me furious!

605
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:45,719
Go away!

606
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:49,181
I must be having a terrible day today.

607
00:47:05,822 --> 00:47:08,700
You want a list of guests and agencies
that participated in yesterday's event?

608
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:11,745
Yes, there's something
I want to look into.

609
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,248
Please.

610
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:17,751
That's too bad.

611
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:20,837
I can't share personal
information like that.

612
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:22,464
Then,

613
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:26,134
why don't we investigate together?

614
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:29,680
Investigate what?

615
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:34,017
Are you thinking that someone
could have harmed Yeon-seo yesterday?

616
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:35,477
I would like to believe that I'm wrong.

617
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,145
That's why

618
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:39,398
I want to look into this.

619
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:42,818
Yeon-seo recently got her surgery.

620
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,736
And she worked too much
to return as a dancer.

621
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:45,904
Considering her circumstances,

622
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:48,323
a glass of wine is enough
to push her over the edge.

623
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:51,743
To clarify, you already made up your mind
that it is completely

624
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:53,453
Yeon-seo's fault.

625
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:56,665
There's no reason to deny that.

626
00:47:57,082 --> 00:47:58,041
Logically speaking.

627
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:01,753
I understand.

628
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:05,424
Actually, I expected

629
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:08,051
that you would be eager
to help me investigate

630
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:10,220
because you're her family.

631
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,162
What brings you here?

632
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:18,997
Director Ji isn't here now.

633
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:22,125
Excuse me.

634
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:24,544
What do you think you're doing?

635
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:27,214
Before I report you
for obstruction of business,

636
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:28,382
leave immediately.

637
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:38,266
I'll take care of him.

638
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,768
Just keep an eye on him for now.

639
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:42,521
He's cute.

640
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:51,863
If I run the blood test now, I'll get
the result tonight at the earliest.

641
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:52,948
Please take care of it.

642
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:54,783
And you too.

643
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:55,784
Don't you worry.

644
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:58,453
I know a glass of wine
won't get you that drunk.

645
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:01,540
Once we get the result,
we might be able to catch who it is.

646
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:25,480
I went to the ballet theater.

647
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:28,692
How is it there?

648
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:31,987
Actually, it's so obvious.

649
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:33,697
The sponsors probably
demanded to kick me out.

650
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,198
And dancers will be gossiping about me.

651
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:37,534
"She's unbelievable. She was crazy."

652
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:42,497
Everything will get resolved.

653
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:44,583
I believe that it wasn't your fault.

654
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:46,084
How will belief resolve anything?

655
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:11,526
My gosh, you look gaunt.

656
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:14,529
Why are you here?
What do you want to know?

657
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:15,947
Don't be so harsh.

658
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:18,033
I barely managed to
calm down those sponsors

659
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:20,118
who wanted to barge in here.

660
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:21,495
What do they want?

661
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:22,996
Do they want me to kneel down?

662
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:24,748
It would be great if it was that simple.

663
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:37,886
Mr. Park.

664
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:45,602
WITHDRAWAL AGREEMENT
ON THE POWER OF ATTORNEY

665
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:47,854
I truly did my best to help you.

666
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:49,523
When you weren't at your best,

667
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:51,942
I tried to protect you
by extending the power of attorney.

668
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:54,069
And when you stubbornly
asked me to give it back,

669
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:56,071
I even announced
that I would be resigning.

670
00:51:58,281 --> 00:51:59,199
You know what?

671
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:04,621
Power of attorney or extension.

672
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:06,540
Forget about it all.

673
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:11,169
Give everything to me.

674
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:12,754
You must.

675
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:17,342
I don't need money
from those perverted sponsors.

676
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:19,511
I'll sell the house
to pay for the show if I need to.

677
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:20,595
That's enough, right?

678
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:23,640
It's not just about money.

679
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:27,269
They even said that we should send you
to a mental institution.

680
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:30,438
They questioned how we could let a girl
who isn't in her right mind take over

681
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:32,274
this big foundation
and the ballet theater.

682
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:33,233
I made

683
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:36,486
one mistake that day.

684
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:41,533
Or it could be a trap someone set up.

685
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:44,536
There you go again.

686
00:52:44,786 --> 00:52:45,954
Who on earth

687
00:52:46,162 --> 00:52:47,622
would set up this meticulous trap

688
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:50,250
and go through all that trouble
just to kick you out?

689
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:52,460
Oh, right.

690
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:55,463
The ballet theater will go on a strike.

691
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,133
They can't perform with a girl like you.

692
00:52:58,425 --> 00:52:59,384
You understand that, right?

693
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:02,053
Don't live in your
memories like an old lady.

694
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,972
You're not the same Yeon-seo.

695
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:06,850
No one is welcoming you back.

696
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:08,351
Did you get that?

697
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:10,020
Excuse me, ma'am!

698
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:12,439
Gosh, you startled me.

699
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:15,483
Did you just yell at me?

700
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:16,484
There is a saying.

701
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:19,571
"Abstain from every form of evil.

702
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:21,364
Greed gives birth to sin.

703
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:23,742
When it's full-grown,
it gives birth to death."

704
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:26,036
Hey, Dan. What's the matter with you?

705
00:53:26,202 --> 00:53:27,412
What's going on here?

706
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:29,122
Have both of you gone crazy?

707
00:53:29,205 --> 00:53:31,875
I understand that you may get carried
away. I know that temptation is strong,

708
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:35,503
but you're the only family Yeon-seo has.

709
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:39,341
Why don't you cherish her?
Why don't you love her?

710
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:42,636
How could you treat her
no better than a stranger?

711
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:45,555
Why do you hurt her like this? Why?

712
00:53:47,515 --> 00:53:50,185
You are surely blessed with
having a loyal secretary.

713
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:51,728
Mr. Cho and now this guy.

714
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:54,481
They'll do everything for you.

715
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:57,525
You must feel reassured
even without your family.

716
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:01,863
Leave now.

717
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:03,573
Don't you ever come to see me.

718
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:10,288
I'll give you 12 hours.

719
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:11,373
Resign on your own.

720
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:15,126
If you continue to be stubborn,
all of the sponsors will leave.

721
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:17,087
And once the reputation
of Fantasia is tainted,

722
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:19,464
this foundation your parents established

723
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:21,758
will vanish into thin air.

724
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:26,930
And the only person to stop that
from happening is me, Choi Yeong-ja.

725
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:29,891
Keep that in mind.

726
00:54:38,274 --> 00:54:39,859
Thank you for the juice.

727
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:02,173
It's almost ready.

728
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:03,299
After you drink this,

729
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:05,260
don't think about anything
and just get some sleep.

730
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:15,395
Let's go upstairs.

731
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:57,187
What are you doing?

732
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:58,396
No, don't drink.

733
00:55:58,646 --> 00:55:59,856
Who do you think you are?

734
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:03,443
Don't be such a fool.

735
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:05,361
You went through so much yesterday.
What is this?

736
00:56:05,987 --> 00:56:07,322
You requested a blood test.

737
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:08,406
When we get the result--

738
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:09,616
It'll be useless.

739
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:14,412
I'm sure someone put
stimulant drugs somewhere.

740
00:56:14,996 --> 00:56:16,247
But

741
00:56:16,414 --> 00:56:19,334
alcohol and sedative
were found in your blood too.

742
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:21,002
Did you take any medications?

743
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:24,589
Everything is mixed up,

744
00:56:24,672 --> 00:56:26,633
so they aren't sure
if it could be used as evidence.

745
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:31,346
They can't find out if what I had was
poison, medication, or alcohol,

746
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:34,766
or who did it to me.

747
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:38,353
I must really have gone crazy.

748
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:39,687
It's all my fault.

749
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:41,439
I tried my best to be on the lookout.

750
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:43,691
I wanted to make sure I protect you.

751
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:46,986
It's my fault.

752
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,656
-No.
-You said

753
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:51,658
greed gives birth to sin.

754
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:55,995
I guess it was greed for me to wish

755
00:56:58,123 --> 00:56:59,332
to do ballet again.

756
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:06,381
No. It isn't.

757
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:09,843
My first audience said

758
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:13,304
that my dance was the prettiest thing
he has ever seen in his life.

759
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:15,932
A kid who doesn't know what ballet is

760
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:18,893
became touched and cried.

761
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:21,020
I know.

762
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:23,148
I felt that way too.

763
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:27,569
I was so happy back then.

764
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:31,823
He helped me realize that I'm happy

765
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,742
when I dance.

766
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,330
But I forgot that for such a long time.

767
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:41,916
I finally

768
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:44,961
found my goal again,

769
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:48,882
but

770
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,093
it's too tough.

771
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:55,722
It's tough.

772
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:23,082
Ms. Lee.

773
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:28,046
Can't you just give up on everything?

774
00:58:30,965 --> 00:58:32,717
I hate to see you suffer.

775
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:37,430
You don't have to keep dancing

776
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:39,724
for Fantasia.

777
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:44,521
If you need an audience to dance,

778
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:47,357
I will watch you.

779
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:50,068
Okay?

780
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:54,822
Should I?

781
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:58,660
Should I give up on everything,

782
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:02,372
only show my dance to you,

783
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:05,792
and live forever with you?

784
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:15,134
Okay.

785
00:59:21,849 --> 00:59:24,102
I will give you my first performance.

786
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:27,605
This piece is called

787
00:59:28,606 --> 00:59:29,649
Giselle.

788
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,117
It's you again.

789
01:00:34,088 --> 01:00:35,006
Dan.

790
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:37,925
Yes, Ms. Lee.

791
01:00:40,845 --> 01:00:43,139
Why do you always save me?

792
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:48,936
You save me

793
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:51,939
and help me out.

794
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:54,901
But why don't you like me?

795
01:00:58,821 --> 01:00:59,656
Figures.

796
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:02,617
No one in this world likes me.

797
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:06,162
I don't care about that.

798
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:12,043
But it's not okay for you

799
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:15,755
to not like me.

800
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:17,006
I hate it.

801
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:18,966
It's frustrating.

802
01:01:21,302 --> 01:01:22,887
You said I'm good.

803
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:25,848
You said I'm pretty.

804
01:01:27,725 --> 01:01:28,643
But...

805
01:01:31,229 --> 01:01:33,106
But why don't you like me?

806
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:35,733
How can you not like me?

807
01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:39,570
How?

808
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:42,073
Dan.

809
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:23,030
I

810
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:26,993
cannot like you.

811
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:29,370
And I

812
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:34,250
can't stay by your side forever.

813
01:02:35,668 --> 01:02:36,711
That really

814
01:02:37,795 --> 01:02:39,005
breaks my heart.

815
01:02:40,214 --> 01:02:41,132
Yeon-seo.

816
01:02:42,216 --> 01:02:43,176
How can I

817
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:48,347
not like you?

818
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:05,072
Don't go.

819
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:09,869
Don't go.

820
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:14,040
How do you really feel?

821
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:16,667
Are you worried he isn't the real one?

822
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:19,212
Or are you wishing that
he isn't the real one?

823
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:29,972
I'm in huge trouble, aren't I?

824
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:36,312
-What are you doing?
-No, what's with you?

825
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:40,650
-Let go of me. Let go
-You can't run away.

826
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:43,319
Tell me you'll disappear
from Yeon-seo's life now.

827
01:03:43,402 --> 01:03:44,612
What are you talking about?

828
01:03:44,695 --> 01:03:45,822
I warned you, didn't I?

829
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:47,782
That I won't let you live
if you interfere.

830
01:03:47,865 --> 01:03:51,369
Who do you think you are to tell her
to give up on dancing?

831
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:54,831
I said, let go!

832
01:04:49,468 --> 01:04:51,929
You promised me that whatever you do,

833
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:53,389
you'll do it to make Yeon-seo happy.

834
01:04:53,472 --> 01:04:54,390
Why am I like this?

835
01:04:54,473 --> 01:04:55,850
He really gets on my nerves.

836
01:04:55,933 --> 01:04:56,976
Hey, what are you doing?

837
01:04:57,059 --> 01:05:00,187
Whatever you decide to do,
you are no longer alone.

838
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:03,691
I'll make you like it.

839
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:06,402
I'll make you love it. I'll do that.

840
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:11,449
What are you doing to Yeon-seo?

841
01:05:11,866 --> 01:05:14,869
Kim Dan. No. Angel Dan.

842
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:17,371
Why are you here?
