1
00:00:00,953 --> 00:00:02,273
   

2
00:00:03,493 --> 00:00:10,513


3
00:00:21,943 --> 00:00:23,613
You're too fast.

4
00:00:25,753 --> 00:00:27,143
Who are you?

5
00:00:27,143 --> 00:00:28,843
You're a 1/16 of a note faster.

6
00:00:28,843 --> 00:00:31,003
If you die, get sad, or fall in love faster than the music,

7
00:00:31,003 --> 00:00:33,563
If you die, get sad, or fall in love faster than the music,

8
00:00:33,563 --> 00:00:35,353
how will the audience feel if every moment is spoiled from rushing?

9
00:00:35,353 --> 00:00:37,243
I asked, who are you?

10
00:00:37,243 --> 00:00:39,163
Corps de ballet.

11
00:00:39,163 --> 00:00:42,503
Your backs are too relaxed. You better put more tension into your posture!

12
00:00:42,503 --> 00:00:46,243
Don't you know that a dancer's back is the foundation for how they express their emotions?

13
00:00:46,243 --> 00:00:50,363
Even if one relaxes their muscles, the entire performance collapses.

14
00:00:50,923 --> 00:00:53,193
- Don't you know that?
 - Hey, hey!

15
00:00:53,193 --> 00:00:56,183
Who are you?

16
00:00:56,683 --> 00:00:58,863
Is "Swan Lake" a

17
00:01:00,573 --> 00:01:02,353
happy ending?

18
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:05,893
Is this meant for children?

19
00:01:06,813 --> 00:01:08,403
I should have introduced myself earlier.

20
00:01:08,403 --> 00:01:12,173
I'm the new artistic director, Ji Kang Wook.

21
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:14,803
Director Ji Kang Wook.

22
00:01:16,853 --> 00:01:19,473
I'm the vice director, Geum Roo Na.

23
00:01:19,473 --> 00:01:23,003
Have everyone gather together within the next 30 minutes.

24
00:01:23,003 --> 00:01:25,743
Isn't the same repertoire tiring after three years?

25
00:01:25,743 --> 00:01:29,923
When your program is going nowhere fast and your shows are obviously only focused on what appeals to the masses,

26
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,983
can you say that this is Korea's best ballet company?

27
00:01:32,983 --> 00:01:36,513
Have you seen our performances for yourself?

28
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:40,683
Music added onto a recorded performance can be out of sync.

29
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:43,983
I and all of our dancers do our best on stage.

30
00:01:43,983 --> 00:01:46,713
If that's your best, we're all in trouble.

31
00:01:46,713 --> 00:01:51,653
I've seen it for myself with my own eyes... the 20th-anniversary performance.

32
00:01:57,553 --> 00:01:59,333
You need to practice more, Miss Ni Na.

33
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:03,993
Even if it's condensed from a 1/16th of a beat to 1/32nd, I have the confidence to be exact.

34
00:02:03,993 --> 00:02:05,983
You're too fast.

35
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:09,723
I'm sure it's unlikely the professional critics that rely on Fantasia's sponsorship have ever complained about it though.

36
00:02:09,723 --> 00:02:10,893
Why don't you confirm it now?

37
00:02:10,893 --> 00:02:15,293
Next time. I'm talking about the future of Fantasia.

38
00:02:15,293 --> 00:02:20,153
- Give me the beat.
  - This year, we will not be doing the Black Swan.

39
00:02:24,663 --> 00:02:27,553
We've already published this year's schedule.

40
00:02:27,553 --> 00:02:29,523
On the performance dates, we'll perform new works.

41
00:02:29,523 --> 00:02:32,693
Works that excel in both artistry and traditional ballet and also have mass appeal.

42
00:02:32,693 --> 00:02:36,883
We're going to do a kind of show that's never been seen before: a new performance of "Giselle."

43
00:02:36,883 --> 00:02:41,053
And... the main ballerina for those shows

44
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:45,173
will be Lee Yeon Seo.

45
00:02:45,703 --> 00:02:49,463
 Cut! Cut! 

46
00:02:49,463 --> 00:02:52,313
Who dares to change up the shows' performances,

47
00:02:52,313 --> 00:02:55,483
and who dares to change up the main roles.

48
00:02:55,483 --> 00:03:01,403
This is  my  Fantasia, and my main character is only Geum Ni Na.

49
00:03:01,403 --> 00:03:04,373
Why are you all standing here?

50
00:03:04,373 --> 00:03:08,273
We need to practice. Follow me.

51
00:03:10,183 --> 00:03:12,533
Follow me.

52
00:03:12,533 --> 00:03:17,183
Follow me, you brats! We need to practice! Practice!

53
00:03:17,183 --> 00:03:22,323
Hey, Geum Ni Na. Shouldn't you at least follow me? You've been my child!

54
00:03:24,933 --> 00:03:28,103
Oh my god. Wow.

55
00:03:29,183 --> 00:03:31,093
Bravo!

56
00:03:32,473 --> 00:03:35,233
What a strong first impression.

57
00:03:36,813 --> 00:03:41,253
Next time, a heads-up would be appreciated. I wasn't expecting this.

58
00:03:45,343 --> 00:03:46,683
Let me make a formal introduction.

59
00:03:46,683 --> 00:03:50,593
Starting today, joining our Fantasia family,

60
00:03:50,593 --> 00:03:53,483
this is Director Ji Kang Wook.

61
00:04:02,413 --> 00:04:06,413
We'll let it go today, but next time, this kind of disruptive episode,

62
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,063
I hope it won't be repeated.

63
00:04:08,063 --> 00:04:11,023
It's because it's such a serious situation.

64
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:16,633
Earlier, about Lee Yeon Seo. That was a joke, right?

65
00:04:16,633 --> 00:04:18,593
It was serious.

66
00:04:19,513 --> 00:04:24,123
Let me make this clear. The person who scouted you is me, Choi Yeong Ja.

67
00:04:24,123 --> 00:04:25,653
Let me also make this clear.

68
00:04:25,653 --> 00:04:30,123
All performances and talent authority resides under my jurisdiction.

69
00:04:30,123 --> 00:04:33,183
Your contract also states that we use board meetings to discuss things, does it not?

70
00:04:33,183 --> 00:04:37,113
It is impossible. If a ballerina rests for a day, they know it.

71
00:04:37,113 --> 00:04:41,783
If they rest for two days, their partner knows it. If they rest for four days, the audience will know it.

72
00:04:41,783 --> 00:04:43,403
It's been three years for Yeon Seo.

73
00:04:43,403 --> 00:04:46,193
She's not going to be able to do a fouette right after regaining her sight.

74
00:04:46,193 --> 00:04:49,863
I was going to have her do the fouette even while she was blind.

75
00:04:49,863 --> 00:04:53,223
As long she agrees to it, I can get her body back to top condition through rehabilitation in no time.

76
00:04:53,223 --> 00:04:55,573
Since she's always been a naturally gifted dancer.

77
00:04:55,573 --> 00:04:57,843
So let's persuade her,

78
00:04:58,553 --> 00:05:04,983
by her aunt, cousin, and I working together sincerely.

79
00:05:08,893 --> 00:05:13,373
As I suspected, I guess taking away the lead from your sister is too difficult for you.

80
00:05:13,373 --> 00:05:17,393
No, this is my call as Fantasia Ballet Foundation's Vice Director.

81
00:05:17,393 --> 00:05:19,813
Your ambitiousness is great, but that won't be possible.

82
00:05:19,813 --> 00:05:23,883
If you shake up a performance underway for a year and get rid of the prima ballerina, we'll be a laughingstock.

83
00:05:23,883 --> 00:05:28,273
It goes without saying that you'll also have to take your fair share of the responsibility for that, Director.

84
00:05:28,743 --> 00:05:30,513
That's fine.

85
00:05:31,183 --> 00:05:32,903
Then, I'll do it myself.

86
00:05:32,903 --> 00:05:35,653
Yeon Seo isn't one who is easily persuaded.

87
00:05:35,653 --> 00:05:37,893
It'd be no fun if she was.

88
00:05:46,223 --> 00:05:48,003
   

89
00:05:57,183 --> 00:05:59,223
You're here for an interview, aren't you?

90
00:05:59,223 --> 00:06:01,523
Yes, so it seems.

91
00:06:01,523 --> 00:06:03,733
- Breathe quietly. 
 - Excuse me?

92
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:07,283
I just got eliminated for breathing too loudly.

93
00:06:09,883 --> 00:06:12,023
What a picky person. So hard to please.

94
00:06:13,663 --> 00:06:16,133
- Are you all right? 
 - Ah, yes, thank you.

95
00:06:16,133 --> 00:06:18,373
Thank you.

96
00:06:21,473 --> 00:06:23,583
Thank you for coming.

97
00:06:36,533 --> 00:06:40,243
You managed to cross off twenty people in less than three hours. You amaze me.

98
00:06:40,243 --> 00:06:42,023
You can tell with one glance that they're not my style.

99
00:06:42,023 --> 00:06:45,523
You should at least test them out first! You could try grabbing their arm and walking around.

100
00:06:45,523 --> 00:06:48,203
Can't you tell right away that they're all fails?

101
00:06:48,203 --> 00:06:52,463
No matter how similar they look on the outside, there's no way they'll be just like him.

102
00:06:52,463 --> 00:06:57,353
The doctor said that a person with a similar vibe to him may help you get better.

103
00:06:57,353 --> 00:07:02,323
That some people keep a large stuffed animal in a lost one's stead.

104
00:07:02,323 --> 00:07:07,833
Rather than a stuffed animal, I would rather have a blunt person like you.

105
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:10,383
- You pain in the ass. 
 - You'll have to give me a written apology for using profanity.

106
00:07:10,383 --> 00:07:12,073
If this is how you're going to be, we're not going to be able to hire anyone!

107
00:07:12,073 --> 00:07:14,303
That's why I told you to just pick a new secretary and driver from among our employees.

108
00:07:14,303 --> 00:07:15,773
No one's up to the task.

109
00:07:15,773 --> 00:07:20,733
Even with offering them a 200% bonus, no one will volunteer thanks to a certain someone's temper.

110
00:07:21,713 --> 00:07:26,553
Then search harder. If you don't want these eyes to go to waste, that is.

111
00:07:42,323 --> 00:07:45,113
Hello, my name is Kim Dan and I'm here for the interview.

112
00:07:45,113 --> 00:07:48,103
We just interviewed the last person though?

113
00:07:48,103 --> 00:07:51,463
Someone contacted me saying I need to be here by three.

114
00:07:54,473 --> 00:07:57,213
   

115
00:07:57,213 --> 00:07:59,143
It really is here.

116
00:08:00,633 --> 00:08:05,483
Kim Dan? Why is someone in their twenties here?

117
00:08:11,623 --> 00:08:15,203
 What was with that guy? He ticks me off. 

118
00:08:19,883 --> 00:08:21,623
Any closing remarks you'd like to give?

119
00:08:21,623 --> 00:08:24,943
Please hire me!

120
00:08:25,723 --> 00:08:27,303
Your enthusiasm is good.

121
00:08:27,303 --> 00:08:30,343
I'll always do my best for Miss to...

122
00:08:34,003 --> 00:08:36,993
bring out the shine from within her.

123
00:08:37,703 --> 00:08:40,263
 I want to see it just one more time. 

124
00:08:40,263 --> 00:08:46,193
 You shining brightly with a smile on your face. 

125
00:08:50,913 --> 00:08:53,473
What did you just say?

126
00:08:53,473 --> 00:08:57,423
 Please work. Please, please, please. 

127
00:08:59,143 --> 00:09:01,103
Shine brightly.

128
00:09:06,893 --> 00:09:09,883
Shine brightly. Shine and sparkle with a bright—

129
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,673
Stop!

130
00:09:16,213 --> 00:09:18,173
That's enough. You may leave.

131
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:23,683
Did I do something wrong? If you could tell me the reason—

132
00:09:23,683 --> 00:09:26,453
Your interview is over so get out.

133
00:09:26,453 --> 00:09:28,593
If I don't get this job, I have nowhere else I can go.

134
00:09:28,593 --> 00:09:31,833
My father kicked me out, you see. And the man who's like an uncle to me is turning a blind eye to me.

135
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:34,773
I'm all alone in this harsh world.

136
00:09:34,773 --> 00:09:36,873
Your point being?

137
00:09:39,053 --> 00:09:42,663
I mean to say that I'm counting on you.

138
00:09:59,043 --> 00:10:02,333
You'd think she'd be utterly devastated but she's prickly as ever.

139
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:06,443
They do say a person can't change who they are. What a nasty personality.

140
00:10:06,443 --> 00:10:08,193
Excuse me?

141
00:10:12,723 --> 00:10:15,053
What I just said was audible, wasn't it?

142
00:10:18,503 --> 00:10:20,623
I totally forgot about that, darn it.

143
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:25,763
Since you already heard all that, I'll go ahead and say one last thing:

144
00:10:25,763 --> 00:10:28,453
Live your life as a nice person, got that?

145
00:10:28,453 --> 00:10:31,563
Shine brightly and be nice!

146
00:10:37,443 --> 00:10:39,363
What's his deal?

147
00:10:41,013 --> 00:10:44,263
Hey! You better stop right there!

148
00:10:44,263 --> 00:10:46,023
Miss!

149
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:50,943
You're walking on your own right now, yes?

150
00:11:00,933 --> 00:11:04,133
I messed up big time. I was totally crazy. I must really be a human then!

151
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:05,933
What do I do now? Should I go back and beg for forgiveness?

152
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:08,733
But I don't want to! But then I'll become dust. But I don't want to become dust either!

153
00:11:08,733 --> 00:11:13,533
Okay, I'll go back in and apologize. Heaven awaits!

154
00:11:14,533 --> 00:11:15,733
Oh, I can't stand her!

155
00:11:15,733 --> 00:11:17,333
- What do I do? 
- Mr. Kim Dan!

156
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,033
What am I going to do?

157
00:11:25,733 --> 00:11:27,133
Here you go.

158
00:11:27,933 --> 00:11:29,333
This is your work phone.

159
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:32,333
Put this next to your bed. When it rings, you run to Miss.

160
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:35,333
And this is the alarm for when you're outside of the house. You run to her when this one rings as well.

161
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:36,533
This is Miss' baby journal.

162
00:11:36,533 --> 00:11:37,733
These are her ballet critiques.

163
00:11:37,733 --> 00:11:39,533
This is the list of things she hates.

164
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:41,333
And this one is the cornea transplant records. And the most important one of all...

165
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:44,733
The contract.

166
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,533
I need to read through all of these?

167
00:11:51,533 --> 00:11:56,933
By the way, is this calendar really your only belonging?

168
00:11:57,933 --> 00:12:02,333
You must have been quite an unfilial son then. He didn't pull any punches when kicking you out.

169
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,933
H-He'll let me back! Definitely!

170
00:12:08,733 --> 00:12:11,733
Then, in courtesy to you, I'll be heading home now.

171
00:12:11,733 --> 00:12:13,433
Have at it.

172
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,333
Infiltration accomplished.

173
00:12:33,233 --> 00:12:34,533
Yeah!

174
00:12:44,133 --> 00:12:46,933
Mr. Kim Dan has finished moving in.

175
00:12:48,283 --> 00:12:50,033
You may go.

176
00:12:55,133 --> 00:13:00,133
Someone who is the opposite of Mr. Jo could be better than someone who's similar to him, right?

177
00:13:00,133 --> 00:13:01,933
I don't believe in any of that.

178
00:13:01,933 --> 00:13:05,733
Stuffed animals or lucky charms, I don't believe in them.

179
00:13:05,733 --> 00:13:07,733
But earlier you couldn't even take a few steps—

180
00:13:07,733 --> 00:13:09,933
I already overcame that, didn't I?

181
00:13:09,933 --> 00:13:13,833
My mind is the problem anyway. I just need to conquer that and then the symptoms will stop.

182
00:13:14,933 --> 00:13:17,333
I'll do it on my own.

183
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:22,433
Then, why did you hire Kim Dan?

184
00:13:29,133 --> 00:13:31,233
♫  Yoo Hoo  ♫

185
00:13:56,733 --> 00:13:57,933
Did you need something?

186
00:13:57,933 --> 00:14:01,433
You're late. You're supposed to get here within one minute of the bell ringing.

187
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,333
Was it not the right side?

188
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:16,433
It was written down that you always stand with him to your right so I should offer you my left arm.

189
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:24,833
Grab hold of my arm.

190
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,933
Oh, look at you go! You're walking!

191
00:14:46,533 --> 00:14:48,333
No need to thank me.

192
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,933
Now that everything's turned out this way, let's heal up quickly.

193
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:54,733
That way, you can get some relaxation, and the spring breeze will flow in nicel—

194
00:14:54,733 --> 00:14:56,133
Shut it.

195
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,733
I don't like talkative people.

196
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,533
Just walk.

197
00:15:03,933 --> 00:15:05,333
Where are we going?

198
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:08,133
♫  1, 2. A 1, 2, 3, 4  ♫

199
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,333
You're terrible at this.

200
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,333
Why does a secretary need to know judo?!

201
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:26,933
Please do a good job with him. As it stands, he'd be a sorry sight to behold in a match against me.

202
00:15:26,933 --> 00:15:28,833
Teach him the pinning technique.

203
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:35,733
No, no, no.

204
00:15:35,733 --> 00:15:41,033
 I'm doomed. No matter how much you strain your eyes, there's not an ounce of love to be found in this woman. 

205
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,133
Piano!

206
00:15:49,133 --> 00:15:50,733
Get out.

207
00:15:53,533 --> 00:15:55,233
The corridor!

208
00:16:00,533 --> 00:16:02,533
You call this cleaning?

209
00:16:02,533 --> 00:16:05,333
Do your job right! Clean it properly!

210
00:16:05,933 --> 00:16:11,133
 Were humans really made in the image of God? 

211
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,733
Can't you even count calories right?

212
00:16:18,533 --> 00:16:19,533
I'm not eating this.

213
00:16:19,533 --> 00:16:24,633
 If so, then how did that devil of a woman turn out to be such a giant ingrate? 

214
00:16:27,533 --> 00:16:30,633
Oh, this smells great. Give it a sniff!

215
00:16:34,533 --> 00:16:37,933
 She has no sense of optimism or empathy. 

216
00:16:37,933 --> 00:16:41,533
 There are 198 items on her list of things she hates. 

217
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:46,133
 There's not a single person in this household that likes her. 

218
00:16:46,133 --> 00:16:47,833
 Including me. 

219
00:16:50,733 --> 00:16:54,833
But just you wait and see. Even if it takes turning the world upside down to do it,

220
00:16:55,533 --> 00:16:59,533
I'll make you fall in love for sure!

221
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:30,533
♫  I wanna be your light  ♫

222
00:17:33,503 --> 00:17:38,293
♫  When you're lost in the darkness  ♫

223
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:42,533
♫  I wanna be a butterfly  ♫

224
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:51,533
♫  I reach out my hand to draw it  ♫

225
00:17:51,533 --> 00:17:56,733
♫  Why isn't this easier?  ♫

226
00:17:57,533 --> 00:17:58,733
♫  What do I have to do  ♫

227
00:17:58,733 --> 00:18:01,933
 As you already know, back when I was the only main dancer here, 

228
00:18:01,933 --> 00:18:06,433
 our Geum Ni Na was my understudy. My shadow. 

229
00:18:07,133 --> 00:18:09,333
  You're 1/16th of a beat fast. 

230
00:18:10,133 --> 00:18:15,133
 If you die, get sad, or fall in love faster than the music, 

231
00:18:15,133 --> 00:18:17,933
 how will the audience feel when every moment is spoiled from rushing? 

232
00:18:17,933 --> 00:18:24,433
♫  I can feel you again  ♫

233
00:18:26,933 --> 00:18:31,133
I thought rushing was your only problem, but it looks like you're not smart either.

234
00:18:32,133 --> 00:18:35,333
♫  When I hug you tight  ♫

235
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:39,933
♫  spreads even further  ♫

236
00:18:39,933 --> 00:18:44,533
♫  as the light that you are  ♫

237
00:18:44,533 --> 00:18:46,133
Are you trying to sprain your ankle?

238
00:18:46,133 --> 00:18:50,133
You should know what it means when someone tells a dancer, "Next time."

239
00:18:50,133 --> 00:18:53,533
It means they'll never look at you again and that you're done for.

240
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:57,333
Honestly speaking, you didn't have any intention of giving me another chance, did you?

241
00:18:58,133 --> 00:19:00,533
You've already made your decision about me.

242
00:19:01,533 --> 00:19:05,233
When I say, "Next time" I really mean it. I don't beat around the bush.

243
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:32,533
I'm back.

244
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:04,133
How's it going? She still can't move around?

245
00:20:05,133 --> 00:20:08,733
She became able to walk after hiring a new secretary?

246
00:20:08,733 --> 00:20:10,133
Okay.

247
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:20,633
I guess it's about time to start putting things in motion.

248
00:20:25,723 --> 00:20:28,063
Don't worry about it too much.

249
00:20:28,063 --> 00:20:30,573
It's only been a few days since Yeon Seo's eye surgery.

250
00:20:30,573 --> 00:20:34,863
And plus, can a person who's rested for three years easily make a comeback?

251
00:20:34,863 --> 00:20:37,223
That surgery!

252
00:20:38,093 --> 00:20:42,393
How poorly could you have worked, if a car accident victim gets a transplant?

253
00:20:42,393 --> 00:20:46,003
How could I have guessed that Secretary Jo already submitted all his paperwork?

254
00:20:46,003 --> 00:20:50,933
And plus, you know that I did everything possible to block every new transplant that became available.

255
00:20:50,933 --> 00:20:53,493
I opened a can of worms.

256
00:20:53,493 --> 00:20:58,183
Oh, really!  The minister is even giving me pressure because she gained her eye-sight back.

257
00:20:58,183 --> 00:21:01,593
But wait, now that she can see,

258
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,823
what happens if she asks for the foundation back?

259
00:21:03,823 --> 00:21:06,573
We have to give it back. It's originally hers.

260
00:21:08,553 --> 00:21:10,443
You frustrating person!

261
00:21:10,443 --> 00:21:15,933
Feel free to go back to being a debt-ridden happy-go-lucky fool that always puts others first if you want.

262
00:21:15,933 --> 00:21:20,003
Me? Me? I'm never going back!

263
00:21:25,463 --> 00:21:27,353
Have you confirmed?

264
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:31,053
I'm telling you there's something there.

265
00:21:31,453 --> 00:21:36,393
What? No one's gone through Mr. Jo's personal items yet?

266
00:21:43,543 --> 00:21:46,053
Well, we should take care of that for him then.

267
00:21:58,133 --> 00:22:00,343
Who was in charge of the yard today?

268
00:22:00,913 --> 00:22:04,923
I could have cracked my head open from slipping on these wet petals just now.

269
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:06,893
Who was in charge?

270
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:10,813
- How about you just stop this? 
 -  Don't get involved.

271
00:22:10,813 --> 00:22:16,173
I'll clean up the yard. I'll sweep up every last petal, okay? Problem solved.

272
00:22:17,493 --> 00:22:19,813
Go on back in.

273
00:22:20,313 --> 00:22:22,333
Don't go back in.

274
00:22:27,053 --> 00:22:30,213
You're overstepping your authority. Do we need a refresher on the terms of the contract?

275
00:22:30,213 --> 00:22:32,123
Well, I've yet to sign the contract anyway.

276
00:22:32,123 --> 00:22:35,253
Shall we pull out the laws on what constitutes employer abuse of power while we're at it?

277
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:38,463
I'm sure there's plenty there to talk about, no?

278
00:22:38,963 --> 00:22:42,623
Go back inside. Go back. Go on, go back!

279
00:22:42,623 --> 00:22:44,503
That's it. Go on.

280
00:22:45,653 --> 00:22:47,423
Hey!

281
00:22:51,133 --> 00:22:53,433
You've got a beef with sunsets, don't you?

282
00:22:53,433 --> 00:22:55,903
- What? 
 -  You have an especially big hissy fit whenever the sun sets.

283
00:22:55,903 --> 00:22:58,553
What is it? Were you dumped at sundown?

284
00:22:58,553 --> 00:23:01,793
Did you witness your first love cheating on you underneath the blazing setting sun or something? Well?

285
00:23:01,793 --> 00:23:03,063
What's the reason behind it?

286
00:23:03,063 --> 00:23:05,873
That's right. Sunsets drive me crazy.

287
00:23:05,873 --> 00:23:10,613
It makes me want to burn everyone to shreds with its fiery red glow. Satisfied?

288
00:23:11,553 --> 00:23:17,253
If you realize that, then why do you do it? It's only by loving again that you can forget a past love.

289
00:23:17,253 --> 00:23:22,963
Before you go even crazier, how about going on a date with a new and better guy?

290
00:23:22,963 --> 00:23:27,713
It's just like that one song says, "Even if we speak with the tongues of angels, even if we gain all the world and its knowledge,

291
00:23:27,713 --> 00:23:33,113
even if we offer all of ourselves for someone else, without love, we have nothing."

292
00:23:35,173 --> 00:23:37,213
Come to think of it, now I regret it.

293
00:23:37,213 --> 00:23:39,943
Not asking what your religion was at the interview, that is.

294
00:23:40,943 --> 00:23:43,353
Make this place spotless.

295
00:24:09,623 --> 00:24:12,203
Excuse me, can you give me this one?

296
00:24:27,983 --> 00:24:29,913
"The tongues of angels."

297
00:24:29,913 --> 00:24:32,303
♫  1, 2.  A 1, 2, 3 ,4  ♫

298
00:24:32,303 --> 00:24:34,413
 That crazy quack. 

299
00:24:34,413 --> 00:24:37,773
 Instead of a pickpocket or pervert, you're a crazy quack? 

300
00:24:37,773 --> 00:24:41,943
 Not all humans become as twisted from tragedy as you have. 

301
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:44,773
He couldn't be...

302
00:24:45,623 --> 00:24:49,863
♫  Summer heat with eyes  ♫

303
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:53,393
♫  As cool as the sea  ♫

304
00:24:53,393 --> 00:24:57,243
♫  I'd drown all day if you'd stay  ♫

305
00:24:57,243 --> 00:25:00,113
This rain is just like Lee Yeon Seo.

306
00:25:00,113 --> 00:25:03,443
No matter how much I sweep, that blasted rain just makes more petals fall.

307
00:25:03,443 --> 00:25:07,613
Meaning it's useless. A wasted effort.

308
00:25:07,613 --> 00:25:11,743
I mean, she's got nothing that I can work with.

309
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:15,273
If there was at least one thing that she liked I could take advantage of that,

310
00:25:15,273 --> 00:25:17,783
Her soul is like Sodom and Gomorrah (destined for divine retribution).

311
00:25:19,543 --> 00:25:24,193
♫  I want something sweeter you see  ♫

312
00:25:24,193 --> 00:25:28,403
♫  Something to show  ♫

313
00:25:28,403 --> 00:25:32,333
♫  Show that you love me  ♫

314
00:25:36,413 --> 00:25:38,513
Oh my gosh, what the heck? Why are these out?!

315
00:25:38,513 --> 00:25:41,353
Whoa! What's going on?

316
00:25:41,353 --> 00:25:44,113
What is all this?

317
00:25:44,113 --> 00:25:45,973
What's that?

318
00:25:50,723 --> 00:25:52,223
   

319
00:25:52,223 --> 00:25:54,413
Oh, drat!

320
00:26:25,263 --> 00:26:27,133
She's gone.

321
00:27:04,613 --> 00:27:06,603
Oh, you must be kidding me!

322
00:27:07,093 --> 00:27:12,013
Be gone! Be gone, I say! Oh, come on! This is making me crazy.

323
00:27:12,013 --> 00:27:16,183
Emergency alert! My body is out of order. Darn.

324
00:27:27,283 --> 00:27:29,383
Lee Yeon Seo? Oh no!

325
00:27:29,383 --> 00:27:31,683
What am I supposed to do?

326
00:27:47,753 --> 00:27:49,873
Ugh, I can't believe this. Darn it!

327
00:28:01,173 --> 00:28:02,833
Don't do it! Don't do it! Don't!

328
00:29:52,533 --> 00:30:02,983


329
00:30:04,623 --> 00:30:08,073
♫  You are my angel  ♫

330
00:30:08,073 --> 00:30:14,833
♫  Oh, you are my angel always  ♫

331
00:30:14,833 --> 00:30:18,943
♫  You're here  ♫

332
00:30:18,943 --> 00:30:22,573
♫  Oh, you are my angel  ♫

333
00:30:22,573 --> 00:30:29,383
♫  Oh, you're by my side always  ♫

334
00:30:29,383 --> 00:30:36,563
♫  always, stay here forever  ♫

335
00:30:36,563 --> 00:30:41,883
♫  It's alright, it's alright  ♫

336
00:30:41,883 --> 00:30:49,793
♫  even if darkness envelops my body  ♫

337
00:30:49,793 --> 00:30:53,473
♫  it's alright, it's alright  ♫

338
00:30:53,473 --> 00:30:56,843
 I don't get people. I especially don't get Lee Yeon Seo. 

339
00:30:56,843 --> 00:30:59,353
 Ready? One, two, three! Ouch! 

340
00:30:59,353 --> 00:31:00,613
 That pervert nutjob. 

341
00:31:00,613 --> 00:31:05,303
 Have you even ever liked someone enough that just looking at them made you happy? 

342
00:31:05,303 --> 00:31:08,203
 To be honest, I really miss you too. 

343
00:31:08,203 --> 00:31:11,723
 How can I make Lee Yeon Seo's heart beat again? 

344
00:31:11,723 --> 00:31:15,323
 There's hope for you after all. 

345
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,603
 I'll be that for you. 

346
00:31:19,603 --> 00:31:22,833
 A person that exists only for you. 

347
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:26,099
♫  You are my angel  ♫
