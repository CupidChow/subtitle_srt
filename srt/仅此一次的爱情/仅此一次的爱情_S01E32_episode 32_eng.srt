1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,100
    

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:10,580


3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,500
- We're home. 
- We're home.

4
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,100
It really feels like we came home.

5
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,000
We really did.

6
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,200
What happened?

7
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,600
 I thought that was the end, but... 

8
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,700
 "To Angel Dan. 

9
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,700
 Angel Dan, helping the human, Lee Yeon Seo, 

10
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,900
 learn about genuine love, 

11
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,500
 he has dutifully completed his mission.   

12
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,000
 The true love which overcomes all difficulty 

13
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,200
 is to sacrifice oneself for that love. 

14
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,600
 You successfully finished your mission. 

15
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,100
 Even so, you have committed the crime of loving a human. 

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,500
 However, 

17
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,500
 due to your supervising archangel's prayers and 

18
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,500
 resignation to committing a large sin, 

19
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,100
 as well as for the beautiful dance I gladly received, 

20
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,890
 your sin will be forgiven. 

21
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,500
 Therefore, 

22
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:21,600
 Angel Kim Dan will end his life and return to heaven." 

23
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,900
So you didn't become a human.

24
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,480
I guess you're an angel now.

25
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,400
Are you disappointed?

26
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,500
As long as you don't disappear, it's fine.

27
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,300
If you disappear, I feel like I might die.

28
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,900
Thanks to you, I didn't turn into dust.

29
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,200
That's why I could come.

30
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,900
I really missed your scent.

31
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,000
Me too.

32
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,900
- This? 
- Pour it.

33
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,300
Like this, push it down. Pour, pour.

34
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,000
Slowly, slowly.

35
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,500
♫  When a cold wind touches  ♫

36
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,200
Come here.

37
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:39,300
♫  I think of you who came to me softly  ♫

38
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,300
It's really scary, isn't it?

39
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,300
No, it's not scary at all.

40
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,500
Then why?

41
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,900
It's comfortable like this.

42
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,500
♫   Little by little   ♫

43
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:56,700
Hey. Why are you...

44
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,300
♫  I might have realized  ♫

45
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:04,500
♫  That from that point on, every night  ♫

46
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,500
♫  My mind will be filled  ♫

47
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,300
♫  with thinking of you  ♫

48
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,500
Yes!

49
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:20,100
One, two, three...

50
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,900
Gosh, it's going to get red.

51
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,900
Red? It looks the same as before.

52
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,700
I got it.

53
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,300
♫  Will you know I feel infatuated?  ♫

54
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,300
Look, it will hurt.

55
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,500
 It's me. I figured you would be missing your prince, so I came. 

56
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:43,900
 Sadly, the mermaid did not speak. 

57
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:48,300
The prince did not recognize the mermaid.

58
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,800
What a jerk.

59
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,500
He spent so much time with her, but he ended up marrying the princess from the next country.

60
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,500
Because he didn't know.

61
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,700
Keep going.

62
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:05,900
Change it to where the prince recognized the mermaid and married her.

63
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,500
♫  It's getting bigger little by little  ♫

64
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,600
My goodness. You always want it your way, Noisy Gong.

65
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:17,300
The sisters told her, "Stab the prince in the heart using this knife."

66
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,300
"If you don't do that, you will become foam."

67
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,600
The little mermaid smiled and replied,

68
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,000
"It's okay. I'm happy even now."

69
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,100
- Dan.
 - Hm?

70
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,100
This is a dream, isn't it?

71
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,700
How did you know?

72
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,800
Your heart...

73
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,890
is not beating.

74
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:33,000
So, you're an illusion.

75
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,900
An illusion of what I wanted to see.

76
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,700
An illusion of what I wanted to see.

77
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,200
It's not an illusion.

78
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,200
It really is me.

79
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:08,800
"Angel Kim Dan will end his life and return to Heaven."

80
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,600
No. I will not go.

81
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:34,270
Can you do that?

82
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,100
I didn't get to say goodbye to you properly.

83
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,200
I...

84
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,400
guess I'm going to die soon.

85
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:52,700
So, that's why you came to say goodbye. The last goodbye.

86
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,790
Listen carefully, Yeon Seo.

87
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,700
At first, I was confused and then resentful.

88
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,500
Why did He make me meet you again

89
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:19,600
and give me a hard time to witness your death?

90
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,300
But when I think about it,

91
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:28,900
the time that we were given was a gift.

92
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,900
What kind of gift gets taken back?

93
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:45,500
I was given 100 days instead of dying that day.

94
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,500
I got to meet you, I got to know you,

95
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,300
and I got to love you.

96
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:59,000
This is enough. More than enough.

97
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,300
I would like it if you laugh a lot.

98
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:09,100
It's okay to cry sometimes, but don't cry too much.

99
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:13,800
Keep dancing, always be happy,

100
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,300
and blow your temper sometimes.

101
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,900
Live. Live like a person.

102
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,100
You want me to live?

103
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,700
It's my last wish.

104
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:30,000
It's your gift to me.

105
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,400
I loved you.

106
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,600
I love you.

107
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,500
And I will love you.

108
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,100
♫   I can say anything that I want   ♫

109

♫   When I want   ♫

♫   So watch me break   ♫

114
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,500
 Although I struggled because of my fate, 

115
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:25,500
 looking back, it was all my choice. 

116
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,300
 Saving Lee Yeon Seo, 

117
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,900
 loving her, 

118
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,550
 also trying to kill the evil, 

119
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,900
 and not killing it. 

120
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,500
 I give my new life as an angel to Lee Yeon Seo. 

121
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:50,840
 This is my final decision. 

122
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,000
 Goodbye... 

123
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:05,200
 Lee Yeon Seo.

00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,120
Miss!

133
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:51,100
You're awake. You woke up?

134
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,900
It worked! It really worked!

135
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,700
Doctor!

136
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,300
    

137
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,100
I am Lee Yeon Seo, the new leader of Fantasia Ballet Company.

138
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,300
I'd like to formally greet you.

139
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,500
Are you feeling okay? This is your first time out in three months.

140
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,100
It might be hard to begin ballet right now, but I'm doing physical training.

141
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:27,900
Director Ji Kang Woo did a great job of running the ballet company.

142
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,700
Since you went through bad luck, wouldn't it be better to have a magnificent inauguration?

143
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,300
We should cut unnecessary expenses.

144
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:38,100
I plan to change the system the previous leaders ran by.

145
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,300
I am planning to hire professional management.

146
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:45,300
More importantly, Fantasia Ballet Company will appeal more to the public.

147
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:49,100
We will resume the ballet show program to visit the audience during the second-half's performance.

148
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:59,010
Are you okay?

149
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:02,680
Not a problem. I did some turns last week, too.

150
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,810
I mean emotionally.

151
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:07,580
You haven't left your home in the past three months.

152
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:12,640
I heard you stayed in your room the first week and cried.

153
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:17,670
People left behind must keep living day-by-day.

154
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:20,470
Though that's the cruelest part.

155
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:24,750
Director, I... have hope.

156
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:29,630
No, it's more like an intuition. An intuition that I can meet Dan again.

157
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:34,550
Do you not understand what extinct means? I also had hope, seeing the handkerchief.

158
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:38,220
But now, that feather has turned black.

159
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,350
Your handkerchief is the same, isn't it?

160
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:44,770
And you are still alive and well.

161
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:47,420
I didn't know that I would meet Seong Woo again.

162
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:51,080
Meeting a dead person is actually impossible, isn't it?

163
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,680
But I met him through Dan.

164
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:57,160
Even if you were to meet again, all his memories would be forgotten.

165
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,920
The Kim Dan who wouldn't know you, would he really be him?

166
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,770
It doesn't matter because I remember.

167
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,740
What happened?

168
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,990
There is going to be a final ruling today.

169
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,990
I told you we should go to the court to watch.

170
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:22,340
Do you really want to see that face? I don't even want to see it in my dreams.

171
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,700
News!

172
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,500
It's up.

173
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:32,320
"Violating management law, instigating murders, attempted murder, and hiding a criminal."

174
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,300
So many sins.

175
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,030
Seventeen years in prison?

176
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:38,730
President Geum Gi Chan is sentenced to six years,

177
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:42,770
and Mr. Park got seven years with extenuating circumstances.

178
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:46,340
What about Vice-President Geum Roo Na?

179
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,650
 Defendant Geum Roo Na. On charges of murder, 

180
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:53,740
 obstruction, and causing damage, I pronounce you guilty. 

181
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,420
 Giving particular consideration that she shows no remorse 

182
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:00,550
 and her crimes are very heinous and carry a high risk of being repeated, 

183
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:05,490
 this court sentences Defendant Goo Roo Na to life in prison. 

184
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,250
5030! You've got a visitor.

185
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:18,900
I have no one to visit me. Who is it?

186
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,960
Your younger sibling.

187
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,050
How are you my younger sibling?

188
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:47,970
I know, right? I hate it, too.

189
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:51,520
You came to mock me? You came to see how bad it is for me?

190
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,510
Of course, there's that, too.

191
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:59,950
I hear you keep trying to commit suicide. I came to tell you not to do that.

192
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,950
Are you worried about me now?

193
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:06,890
Yes, I'm worried that you're going to run away by dying

194
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:09,630
and that you are not going to pay for your crime properly.

195
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:15,340
Unnie, have you ever, even once,

196
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:18,910
sincerely loved someone else?

197
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:23,730
Are you dumb? Who did I do all this for?

198
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:28,080
Don't lie. You never loved Ni Na.

199
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,650
If you really loved her, you wouldn't have done that.

200
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:34,020
Willing to die in order to save the other person...

201
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,630
You never had

202
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:42,900
that feeling in your life. That's why your heart is empty.

203
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,830
And you are trying to fill that empty heart.

204
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,890
What do you know about it to babble?

205
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:53,220
I sincerely feel sorry for you

206
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:58,480
since you will live here the rest of your life not knowing what a sincere heart is.

207
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,770
Take care, Unnie.

208
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,020
Why come here? Seeing her face would only bring you down.

209
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:30,020
I wanted to tell her that she lost completely.

210
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:35,400
Our Miss is back. It feels good.

211
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:43,230
Since everything is wrapped up, let's forget all of it and go back to your old self. Okay?

212
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:01,470
So no one knows?

213
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:04,780
In that drawer, there was a handkerchief.

214
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:10,100
The handkerchief that I put in there when I leave is gone!

215
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,820
- Miss!
 - Does that make sense? They said they didn't see it or touch it!

216
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:19,820
So are you saying that the handkerchief grew legs and walked out of this house or what!

217
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,920
I didn't mean she should get back ill-manners, but I meant she should get over her sadness.

218
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,410
Please!

219
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:35,410
Please, I am asking you. When you clean my room or Dan's room,

220
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:38,590
please don't touch anything.

221
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,370
To the person who brings me the handkerchief, I'll give 200% of your salary as a bonus.

222
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,740
Why did you call Dr. Park? I'm said I'm fine.

223
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:18,710
Would a person who's fine run crazily to the park whenever it rains?

224
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:22,900
Would a normal person stay at home all day and talk to plain air?

225
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,240
 How long do I have to brew this? 

226
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,070
 No matter what I do, it doesn't taste like what you made. 

227
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,270
 Wouldn't it be too bitter if I brew it for four minutes? 

228
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,910
 It's too hot. 

229
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,450
 Don't just stand there, hold me. 

230
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:08,320
I mean, that's because it looked like an illusion.

231
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:13,300
That illusion is a symptom of trauma and stress.

232
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:20,280
The truth is I recognized him first.

233
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,930
When no one recognized him, I did.

234
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:29,070
So wouldn't the Dan I see right now be the real Dan?

235
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:34,010
I will prescribe medication. Please take it without skipping.

236
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:50,900
Miss,

237
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,580
would you like soju?

238
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,400
You're not going to take the medication, right?

239
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,190
Then drink it.

240
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:04,120
Sometimes this is better than medicine.

241
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,740
Give me the handkerchief.

242
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:10,560
I really didn't take it.

243
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,090
You're the only one who hates Dan.

244
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,180
What is this?

245
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,510
To those left behind, it's remembrances;

246
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:33,140
but to those escaping, it's garbage.

247
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,940
 The clothes are left as is! 

248
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:50,050
 And so are the possessions. What exactly— 

249
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,010
Why are you giving me this right now?

250
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:12,150
It was all left behind before you performed.

251
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:14,180
Since then, you were thinking of fleeing,

252
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,530
that is why he hurried the wedding.

253
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:18,750
This is...

254
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,190
Dan's handwriting.

255
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,170
 Congratulations on one year of marriage. 

256
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:34,260
 This is the first time I'm writing a letter to a human and not God. Isn't it an honor? 

257
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,600
 Congratulations on two years of marriage. I love you. 

258
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:52,310
 Congratulations on two years of marriage. Have the rape flowers grown beautifully? 

259
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,190
 Congratulations on ten years of marriage. 

260
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:00,870
 Goodness. Were you not able to forget me? 

261
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:08,480
 Congratulations on 30 years of marriage. 

262
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,470
 I still love you. 

263
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:31,370
I shouldn't drink so much.

264
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:34,900
Drink.

265
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:39,290
Drink and let go. Forget about it.

266
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,630
As you see,

267
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,820
drinking kills your brain cells.

268
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:50,460
Then you forget. That can't happen, ever.

269
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:54,100
I will not forget, not even Dan's lashes.

270
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:00,720
Miss, please recover your senses.

271
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,780
I feel like Dan is next to me.

272
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,020
I keep seeing him.

273
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:12,480
Look over there.

274
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,990
He's standing right there.

275
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,570
Dan!

276
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:20,310
What are you saying is there? There is nothing.

277
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:23,400
Why are you acting like this? You're scaring me.

278
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,340
Did I go insane?

279
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,530
Let's take the medication.

280
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:30,930
When you receive consultation and treatment—

281
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:36,530
I don't want to. If I take medicine, I won't be able to see Dan.

282
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:40,800
If I receive treatment, I won't be able to see Dan even if it's a hallucination.

283
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,670
If I can see Dan because I'm going crazy,

284
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:47,970
I want to stay crazy.

285
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:51,420
I want to 365 days, 24/7.

286
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:56,720
But... But I can't live like that.

287
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,210
He gave me this life. He did.

288
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:06,200
I have to live diligently

289
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,470
for Dan also.

290
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:16,520
I miss him.

291
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:19,590
I want to hug him.

292
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:24,190
I want to smell Kim Dan.

293
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:49,220
♫   I just fall in love ♫ 

294
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:56,860
♫   Today, again, you live inside me ♫

♫   After I met you ♫ 

296
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:04,220
 As I hang onto the light in the deep darkness, 

297
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:07,680
 I look at her as the Angel Dan who is forever in the darkness. 

298
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:11,880
♫  I felt that it was love  ♫

 How long do I have to brew this?  

301
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:22,490
 It doesn't taste like how you did it. 

302
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:25,590
 Will three minutes be enough? 

303

♫   I try to think of other things ♫ 

304

309
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,060
 Dan! 

310
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:52,140
 What are you saying is there? There is nothing there. 

311
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,510
 Thank you, 

312
00:26:54,510 --> 00:27:00,280
 for letting me remain by her side although Lee Yeon Seo can't see. 

313
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,400
 I'm fine. 

314
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,620
 Even if she doesn't know to the end,
even if nobody knows, 

315
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:12,740
 even if I must just watch her forever,  it's fine with me.

♫   ...to you ♫ 

317
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,190
It's disappointing. I wanted to do one more production with you.

318
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:34,980
You won't listen to me and dance how you want to.

319
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:39,240
There was fun in that.

320
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,800
Thank you.

321
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,820
Same here. Are you not going to see the members?

322
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:52,230
I hate those meetings. It's embarrassing and awkward.

323
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:54,280
Okay, then.

324
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:59,590
Director,

325
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:06,130
have you found peace?

326
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:14,080
   

327
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,700
Is there a prima you're eyeing?

328
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,410
I don't know. I have to start looking.

329
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:23,940
There is a really good ballerina. Would you like me to introduce her to you?

330
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,360
How can you just go like this?

331
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,570
Please kill your temper in New York.

332
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:36,960
Thank you.

333
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,960
Wherever you go, do your best.

334
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,590
Yoona and Woojin, get in sync when you are performing.

335
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,450
Soojin, be careful with your shoulders.

336
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:48,010
Also—

337
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:53,330
Till the end, you're nagging us. Just take care of yourself.

338
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,870
Thank you. Thank you for your hard work.

339
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,170
Thank you for your hard work, everyone.

340
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,020
Thank you. Thank you for your hard work.

341
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,420
- Director...
 - Thank you.

342
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:03,210
Let's take a picture. A picture.

343
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,240
Make sure everyone is in it.

344
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,910
Lower down.

345
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:12,870
Fan... ta... si... a!

346
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:25,710
   

347
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:29,920
Don't look at the mirror.

348
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,790
Slowly.

349
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,080
Look up.

350
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,640
Wait a moment. Where did I say you have to look when doing ballet?

351
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,690
Myself.

352
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:42,950
You're right. What do you think you become when you hear this music?

353
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,770
I feel like a cloud in the sky.

354
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:47,570
Right? Then, let's do it again thinking that.

355
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:50,390
Let's do it from the beginning!

356
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:08,530
It may look like this but it's hand-brewed coffee. It's high class.

357
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:12,130
My monthly rent is tight so I have to save.

358
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:15,540
I heard you're going to New York.

359
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:19,360
I heard it as well. Congratulations.

360
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,120
Do you have no intention of standing on stage anymore?

361
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,890
This is for me. Dancing with the kids.

362
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:30,360
I'm satisfied.

363
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,290
When you have a change of heart, come.

364
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:37,490
I specialize in training retired ballerinas.

365
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:42,320
Next time we meet, let's meet as a person

366
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,560
not a ballerina.

Where did Miss go

373
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:20,230
when it's going to rain?

374
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:28,170
Everything is going back to its place.

375
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:31,500
I guess they are all going back to the beginning.

376
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:42,570
But you're not here.

377
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:50,130
I don't even see you as a hallucination.

378
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:52,320
I will live cheerfully.

379
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,760
I will think you are watching me from somewhere.

 Observing human beings is very fascinating. 

432
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:16,180
 If time seems obscure and endless, 

433
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:19,120
 humans shine in many colors as if they might break apart.

 When work ends, everything goes back to its place. 

437
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:30,130
 Humans die and disappear. 

438
