1
00:00:03,073 --> 00:00:07,153
 If angels could also regret, 

2
00:00:10,703 --> 00:00:15,513
 my only regret would be that day. 

3
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:25,433


4
00:00:38,203 --> 00:00:45,783
♫  Just stay, stay with me  ♫

5
00:00:45,783 --> 00:00:48,073
♫  I'm here  ♫

6
00:00:53,133 --> 00:01:00,473
♫  As how it is now  ♫

7
00:01:00,473 --> 00:01:06,923
♫   Just you and I  ♫

8
00:01:07,873 --> 00:01:09,083
   

9
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:14,543
 I shouldn't have done that. 

10
00:01:38,603 --> 00:01:42,513
 I shouldn't have saved that person. 

11
00:01:43,463 --> 00:01:48,133
 That was something I shouldn't have done. 

12
00:02:02,503 --> 00:02:06,333
No. Please!

13
00:02:08,653 --> 00:02:10,543
You're late.

14
00:02:15,893 --> 00:02:18,673
I told you that was your last warning.

15
00:02:27,743 --> 00:02:30,843
Yes. There was a car accident.

16
00:02:30,843 --> 00:02:35,293
This is Highway 8 going to Yangpyung. Please hurry!

17
00:02:42,273 --> 00:02:48,543
Mister, please respond.

18
00:02:49,593 --> 00:02:51,883
I'm scared.

19
00:02:56,123 --> 00:02:58,103
Who are you?

20
00:02:58,103 --> 00:03:01,923
You're fine now. It's all fine.

21
00:03:01,923 --> 00:03:04,203
Now that I am here,

22
00:03:08,103 --> 00:03:10,273
Lee Yeon Seo.

23
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:58,313
It's here.

24
00:03:58,313 --> 00:04:02,533
Like smoke. Like dust.

25
00:04:04,843 --> 00:04:07,273
A place where you rot.

26
00:04:14,673 --> 00:04:19,163
Hear me, Angel Dan.

27
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:40,493
An angel is a messenger for God

28
00:04:40,493 --> 00:04:43,803
and has to be indifferent to human matters.

29
00:04:43,803 --> 00:04:47,613
 However, this angel 

30
00:04:47,613 --> 00:04:50,533
 often broke the rules. 

31
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:55,473
 However, we were hoping that he would do the right thing by himself. 

32
00:04:56,863 --> 00:05:01,533
 He has intervened in a human life in the end. 

33
00:05:05,523 --> 00:05:10,413
 He deserves to be punished severely at once. 

34
00:05:10,413 --> 00:05:14,363
Therefore, this angel will now

35
00:05:14,363 --> 00:05:16,993
disappear.

36
00:05:34,693 --> 00:05:36,683
What are you doing?

37
00:05:50,293 --> 00:05:53,013
I didn't disappear yet?

38
00:05:53,013 --> 00:05:54,533
How?

39
00:05:54,533 --> 00:05:58,123
No. Why?!

40
00:05:58,123 --> 00:06:02,553
From now on, you will not be an angel,

41
00:06:02,553 --> 00:06:05,713
but you will become human Kim Dan.

42
00:06:05,713 --> 00:06:08,673
This is now your last, last chance.

43
00:06:08,673 --> 00:06:11,723
As a human, pursue your last mission.

44
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:14,233
Senior!

45
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:17,143
They say that the humans and animals you saved by breaking the rules

46
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:20,233
are filling the sky up with thank you prayers for saving them.

47
00:06:20,233 --> 00:06:23,023
I'm not sure whether to say "good job" for causing accidents

48
00:06:23,023 --> 00:06:29,353
or to scold you for causing this disaster, you dumbhead.

49
00:06:30,193 --> 00:06:33,493
Thank you. Thank you so much!

50
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:36,763
You only have a hundred days. It was hard even getting those hundred days.

51
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:41,943
The doors will open once you succeed in your mission in a hundred days.

52
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,713
You must never pass a hundred days.

53
00:06:43,713 --> 00:06:45,133
Yes. I will do everything I can.

54
00:06:45,133 --> 00:06:48,663
If you tell me to move the mountain from here to there or order me to bring that sea to this sea, I will do it.

55
00:06:48,663 --> 00:06:52,863
There is no problem. If you tell me to bring all the feathers of the birds in this world, I will do it.

56
00:06:52,863 --> 00:06:55,843
So what is it, my last mission?

57
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:02,893
Love.

58
00:07:41,033 --> 00:07:45,783
 Find love? For who? 

59
00:07:50,513 --> 00:07:53,273
Oh, it's so sunny.

60
00:08:00,423 --> 00:08:03,233
Oh. My shadow.

61
00:08:06,163 --> 00:08:08,323
Oh! Oh!

62
00:08:11,973 --> 00:08:14,553
I'm sorry.

63
00:08:19,873 --> 00:08:21,283
It's okay.

64
00:08:21,283 --> 00:08:24,063
You're a nice person, Mister.

65
00:08:26,903 --> 00:08:28,683
Person?

66
00:08:29,503 --> 00:08:32,653
Oh yeah, I'm a human!

67
00:08:32,653 --> 00:08:37,843
♫  I like where we are heading now ♫

68
00:08:37,843 --> 00:08:41,103
♫  These little feelings are so "Oh!"  ♫

69
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:44,503
♫  I'm crazy over you~ ♫

70
00:08:44,503 --> 00:08:46,753
That love?

71
00:08:46,753 --> 00:08:51,513
I'll find it for you, including trust and hope, as a full package.

72
00:08:51,513 --> 00:08:52,673
I will fulfill the mission!

73
00:08:52,673 --> 00:08:54,013
♫  I'm in love with...  ♫

74
00:08:54,013 --> 00:08:55,313
Yeah!

75
00:09:08,263 --> 00:09:11,293
How is it? Can you see?

76
00:09:12,393 --> 00:09:14,333
The sunset...

77
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,563
It's pretty, isn't it?

78
00:09:16,563 --> 00:09:21,163
Knowing that you'd opened your eyes, Heaven must have set it before you.

79
00:09:23,213 --> 00:09:25,623
 It's beautiful, isn't it? 

80
00:09:25,623 --> 00:09:27,743
 Quite beautiful... 

81
00:09:29,173 --> 00:09:31,333
 Yeon Seo! Hang on tight! 

82
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,893
 Why?! What's going on? 

83
00:09:40,843 --> 00:09:43,403
Yeon Seo, are you okay?

84
00:09:44,563 --> 00:09:46,413
Let's lie you down, okay?

85
00:09:57,203 --> 00:10:02,113
But why are you wearing black?

86
00:10:09,763 --> 00:10:11,863
What about Mister?

87
00:10:15,293 --> 00:10:16,943
Oh!

88
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,603
She's really gone crazy, hasn't she?

89
00:10:19,603 --> 00:10:22,383
Your words are a bit harsh. She's hurt.

90
00:10:22,383 --> 00:10:25,613
Harsh? Me?

91
00:10:25,613 --> 00:10:31,623
She wouldn't be behaving that way if she didn't still think of us as servants.

92
00:10:31,623 --> 00:10:35,263
Putting it plainly, were we responsible for Butler Jo's death?

93
00:10:35,263 --> 00:10:37,703
Did I kill him?

94
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:40,563
I am the one who flipped about corneas or something.

95
00:10:40,563 --> 00:10:41,503
Dear!

96
00:10:41,503 --> 00:10:44,223
Let's go. We've done all we can.

97
00:10:44,223 --> 00:10:46,233
Everyone head on in.

98
00:10:46,233 --> 00:10:49,053
I'll stay with Yeon Seo tonight.

99
00:10:49,053 --> 00:10:50,043
Will you?

100
00:10:50,043 --> 00:10:51,663
You can't!

101
00:10:51,663 --> 00:10:57,173
Come here already! After being humiliated by her like that yesterday, why would you stay with her?

102
00:10:58,183 --> 00:11:02,343
I understand how Yeon Seo feels. How confused and scared she must be.

103
00:11:02,343 --> 00:11:05,883
Her sight, and Mister's death.

104
00:11:06,553 --> 00:11:09,513
If it were me, I'd have fainted.

105
00:11:09,513 --> 00:11:12,763
That's why we should give her a little space until she accepts reality.

106
00:11:12,763 --> 00:11:17,213
I'll ask them to take good care of her, so don't worry.

107
00:11:21,603 --> 00:11:25,323
I have no idea how I gave birth to such a lamb of a girl.

108
00:11:25,323 --> 00:11:29,813
She took after me, as kind as an angel.

109
00:11:29,813 --> 00:11:33,053
Head in first, Dear. I'll be staying at the funeral a bit longer.

110
00:11:33,053 --> 00:11:35,793
Why go back? You finished paying your respects already.

111
00:11:35,793 --> 00:11:38,713
You know he didn't have any family.

112
00:11:38,713 --> 00:11:42,403
He's way too much of a softie.

113
00:11:43,623 --> 00:11:45,663
My god.

114
00:11:49,393 --> 00:11:52,253
   

115
00:11:53,203 --> 00:11:55,353
Room 502.

116
00:12:07,823 --> 00:12:10,523
I'll see for myself.

117
00:12:10,523 --> 00:12:15,073
Till then I won't believe it. I refuse to believe.

118
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:21,513
Room 502.

119
00:12:53,243 --> 00:12:54,923
What's this?

120
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,293
You came?

121
00:13:18,253 --> 00:13:22,373
Do you have a grudge against liquor? Why are you drinking so aggressively?

122
00:13:22,373 --> 00:13:26,313
- Don't drink too much. 
- It feels so vivid.

123
00:13:28,003 --> 00:13:31,013
He was down-to-earth.

124
00:13:31,013 --> 00:13:35,393
And whenever we met, he was smiling to greet me.

125
00:13:35,393 --> 00:13:38,633
He insisted that he shouldn't send me off with nothing.

126
00:13:38,633 --> 00:13:42,883
He packed me fruits and Korean desserts.

127
00:13:43,683 --> 00:13:46,523
My fridge is still filled with those.

128
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,333
Geez.

129
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:53,213
Who can we blame that there is no order for dying?

130
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:58,233
He was a kindhearted person and did good deeds in the end.

131
00:13:58,233 --> 00:14:02,433
He must be in a better place now.

132
00:14:02,433 --> 00:14:03,653
Let's remember him.

133
00:14:03,653 --> 00:14:05,353
Yes.

134
00:14:06,843 --> 00:14:11,723
I will remember everything for you, so you can forget everything:

135
00:14:12,683 --> 00:14:15,723
including scary things, creepy things,

136
00:14:17,113 --> 00:14:22,073
and unfair things you had to suffer. Forget all those and rest in peace.

137
00:14:23,573 --> 00:14:28,213
Unfair? What are you talking about?

138
00:14:42,343 --> 00:14:46,113
 I feel so bad for Secretary Jo. 

139
00:14:46,113 --> 00:14:51,523
 She used him. She and her father worked him to the bone. In the end, Mr. Jo even gave her his corneas. 

140
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:53,673
 Did you hear that? 

141
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:57,913
  This accident may have been planned. 

142
00:14:57,913 --> 00:14:59,403
  Wow, so unexpected. 

143
00:14:59,403 --> 00:15:00,763
 - By who? 
 - Why?  

144
00:15:00,763 --> 00:15:02,363
 Of course, I don't know that. 

145
00:15:02,363 --> 00:15:07,303
In any case, he did all medical tests in advance and appointed the receiver for the corneas.

146
00:15:07,303 --> 00:15:10,233
I heard that Lee Yeon Seo knew about it already.

147
00:15:10,233 --> 00:15:13,743
No way. She can't be that mean.

148
00:15:55,313 --> 00:16:00,113
 Where there is light, there is darkness. Where there is good, there is evil. 

149
00:16:00,113 --> 00:16:04,183
 Where there is life, there is death. 

150
00:16:04,183 --> 00:16:07,783
 May he rest in peace. 

151
00:16:48,933 --> 00:16:52,213
I'm late, Mr. Jo.

152
00:16:52,213 --> 00:16:55,443
 I want to see you smiling brightly like you did back then, 

153
00:16:55,443 --> 00:17:01,123
 just one more time. 

154
00:17:03,793 --> 00:17:05,673
- What's wrong with her? 
- She must be crazy.

155
00:17:51,693 --> 00:17:54,913
Room 502's patient, Lee Yeon Seo, has been reported as leaving the mortuary.

156
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:58,133
Room 502?!

157
00:17:58,133 --> 00:18:03,303
I heard that she left after smiling at the funeral of someone who was in the same car with her. I will look for her.

158
00:18:03,303 --> 00:18:06,793
"Gildam Hospital Room 502."

159
00:18:07,973 --> 00:18:10,063
Lee Yeon Seo?

160
00:18:35,813 --> 00:18:37,513
Yeah, what room was it?

161
00:18:37,513 --> 00:18:39,853
Room 502? Okay.

162
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:43,563
Oh, what about the surgery? It went well, right?

163
00:18:45,963 --> 00:18:47,533
All right, I understand.

164
00:18:57,743 --> 00:19:00,283
Where would you like me to take you?

165

♫  The stillness that pushes your heart  ♫

167

♫  The warmth that disappeared  ♫

168
00:19:42,603 --> 00:19:47,463
♫  Like a miracle  ♫

♫  That unsuspectingly soothing bland smile  ♫

00:20:01,943 --> 00:20:09,283
♫  Gently shaking my heart  ♫

♫  Without trace on the streets  ♫

174

♫  Like strangers  ♫

♫  With these tough hearts  ♫

177

♫  At the end of a long wait  ♫

178

♫  Without the sound of delicate rain  ♫

179

 Tada! 

193
00:21:59,263 --> 00:22:02,993
 When I'm not there with you, treat Mr. Jo like your father 

194
00:22:02,993 --> 00:22:03,673
 Got it? 

195
00:22:03,673 --> 00:22:07,393
 I don't want to. You are my dad and Mr. Jo is "Mister." 

196
00:22:07,393 --> 00:22:09,893
 I see. 

197
00:22:09,893 --> 00:22:13,063
 Mr. Jo is my most beloved Mister in the world! 

198

 Here I come! 

199

 I'll get you back to the right place.

 How? Will you give me your eyes?

 Get my place back? Who are you to say that?

 If you act like my father one more time, 

207

 I'll fire you for real. 

208

Who gave you the right to give me your eyes?

209

Who gave you the right to die?

Please open, Senior!

217
00:23:27,903 --> 00:23:30,233
Why are you doing this? This isn't right!

218
00:23:30,233 --> 00:23:36,363
That girl treated her cornea donation like it was nothing and was smiling like this at the donor's funeral portrait!

219
00:23:36,363 --> 00:23:39,153
She was already heartless and now she's not even sane!

220
00:23:39,153 --> 00:23:41,943
How can a person like that love someone?

221
00:23:41,943 --> 00:23:45,913
Change the mission! Change it, please! Come on!

 Darn it! 

223
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,283
Good day!

224
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:12,683
You must be here for the sunrise mass?

225
00:24:12,683 --> 00:24:15,103
Uh yes, yes.

226
00:24:17,743 --> 00:24:20,213
He looks like a beggar.

227
00:24:21,523 --> 00:24:23,113
Hey!

228
00:24:34,693 --> 00:24:39,323
As a tip for the future, humans die early deaths if they sleep in cold places.

229
00:24:42,283 --> 00:24:46,643
You've been made human, as well? Are you on a special mission, too?

230
00:24:46,643 --> 00:24:49,713
When you're at my level, taking on the human form is a cakewalk.

231
00:24:50,943 --> 00:24:51,863
I'm jealous.

232
00:24:51,863 --> 00:24:55,393
Your precious time is ticking away. Why are you just wasting it?

233
00:24:56,593 --> 00:25:02,923
Actually, I needed to think of it from a human's perspective.

234
00:25:02,923 --> 00:25:05,803
A person who had a nasty personality from the beginning,

235
00:25:05,803 --> 00:25:09,153
loses her sight on top of that and turns cruel as can be.

236
00:25:09,153 --> 00:25:12,743
But then one day she suddenly gains her vision back after going through a death-like accident.

237
00:25:12,743 --> 00:25:15,463
Oh my, she must be so grateful. Wouldn't she be absolutely over the moon?

238
00:25:15,463 --> 00:25:18,803
You would think so, right? But the new eyes turn out to be from the person who used to be absolutely fond of her.

239
00:25:18,803 --> 00:25:22,953
But she used to be snappish towards him.

240
00:25:22,953 --> 00:25:24,203
How do you think she'd feel then?

241
00:25:24,203 --> 00:25:26,803
From a human's perspective?

242
00:25:26,803 --> 00:25:29,493
From a human's perspective?

243
00:25:32,033 --> 00:25:34,753
Won't she still be thankful?

244
00:25:34,753 --> 00:25:35,593
Why, why, why?

245
00:25:35,593 --> 00:25:38,813
Wrong! She'd go crazy, of course! Humans can go plain bonkers you know!

246
00:25:38,813 --> 00:25:40,263
I've given it a lot of thought,

247
00:25:40,263 --> 00:25:41,563
and I think that must be why she smiled like that.

248
00:25:41,563 --> 00:25:43,423
No way!  There's no way.

249
00:25:43,423 --> 00:25:44,983
Her heart is so dried up.

250
00:25:44,983 --> 00:25:47,353
It's so dry that I can't seed love in her heart.

251
00:25:47,353 --> 00:25:49,053
I can't do it, I can't do it.

252
00:25:49,053 --> 00:25:53,253
Then just give up your mission early and turn to dust if you want.

253
00:25:53,253 --> 00:25:55,663
Why does is it have to be that woman? Why?

254
00:25:55,663 --> 00:25:57,823
Why did you have to save "that woman?"

255
00:25:57,823 --> 00:25:59,773
That's becau—

256
00:26:08,503 --> 00:26:14,013
My last advice: shine brightly.

257
00:26:14,013 --> 00:26:15,853
What did you just say?

258
00:26:18,933 --> 00:26:20,523
Whoa.

259
00:26:22,023 --> 00:26:25,803
Oh my. Senior!

260
00:26:25,803 --> 00:26:27,713
Senior!

261
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:44,323
Miss.

262
00:26:44,323 --> 00:26:46,463
Miss!

263
00:26:51,723 --> 00:26:56,113
I came back after sending off Secretary Jo early in the morning (buried him).

264
00:26:59,093 --> 00:27:01,943
Were you going through this all night?

265
00:27:01,943 --> 00:27:03,633
Yes.

266
00:27:05,733 --> 00:27:09,403
Did you put in your eye drops?

267
00:27:09,403 --> 00:27:13,173
No, right? Because it's with me.

268
00:27:15,253 --> 00:27:16,513
What are you doing?

269
00:27:16,513 --> 00:27:19,743
I should ask you that. What are you doing?

270
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:24,413
These are Mr. Jo's eyes.

271
00:27:24,413 --> 00:27:28,693
You can choose to be starved, hurt yourself or skip sleeping for your body,

272
00:27:28,693 --> 00:27:30,033
except for your eyes!

273
00:27:30,033 --> 00:27:32,683
Since those are from Mr. Jo!

274
00:27:34,023 --> 00:27:35,253
I didn't ask for them.

275
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:38,383
Then, cut them out.

276
00:27:45,933 --> 00:27:50,493
I meant there is no one to pamper you now.

277
00:27:50,493 --> 00:27:54,493
You may not know it but Mr. Jo was a very special person to everyone.

278
00:27:54,493 --> 00:27:58,503
He remembered all of our birthdays even including our family members.

279
00:27:58,503 --> 00:28:01,753
If you have his eyes, you shouldn't waste them.

280
00:28:01,753 --> 00:28:03,413
I will ask this of you.

281
00:28:03,413 --> 00:28:06,923
If you are fond of him that much, you should have treated him better.

282
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:10,783
You played hooky, leaving your duties to him.

283
00:28:10,783 --> 00:28:17,363
Other staff all asked favors of him and now you get angry to lose him?

284
00:28:22,533 --> 00:28:24,683
I heard you well.

285
00:28:26,293 --> 00:28:29,383
It was so  touching. 

286
00:28:30,923 --> 00:28:32,323
Did you forget?

287
00:28:32,323 --> 00:28:36,533
That annoying thing we asked him to do was  you. 

288
00:28:36,533 --> 00:28:41,263
Right. Be snappish. That suits you the best.

289
00:28:55,813 --> 00:28:57,673
What'wrong with you?

290
00:29:00,963 --> 00:29:03,873
I can't go.

291
00:29:07,623 --> 00:29:10,943
I know it well.

292
00:29:10,943 --> 00:29:14,223
I can see it well,

293
00:29:14,223 --> 00:29:19,543
but my feet won't move.

294
00:29:24,103 --> 00:29:25,633
Psychological trauma?

295
00:29:25,633 --> 00:29:28,983
This happens often to people when they lose the person that was closest to them.

296
00:29:28,983 --> 00:29:32,153
They become unable to do the things they used to do together with that person.

297
00:29:32,153 --> 00:29:36,133
There was once a husband who lost his wife that used to go bowling with him every Sunday.

298
00:29:36,133 --> 00:29:40,813
He'd get nauseous at the mere sight of a bowling pin and even experienced panic attacks at times.

299
00:29:40,813 --> 00:29:44,123
The closer you are to the person, the stronger the symptoms.

300
00:29:44,123 --> 00:29:47,883
You should get admitted to the hospital again. It's only been a few days since the accident.

301
00:29:47,883 --> 00:29:50,323
People hallucinate when they get weak, right?

302
00:29:50,323 --> 00:29:55,693
I just talked to the doctor. Her inflammation and leucocyte counts are normal.

303
00:29:55,693 --> 00:29:59,833
If she gets discharged and takes rest at home, she will recover soon.

304
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:02,493
You're saying my mind is the problem?

305
00:30:03,653 --> 00:30:09,623
And that I won't be able to do the things I used to do with him?

306
00:30:11,003 --> 00:30:14,733
I did everything with him.

307
00:30:14,733 --> 00:30:18,803
Walking, running, eating, everything.

308
00:30:20,353 --> 00:30:25,393
I'm not going to be able to do any of that?

309
00:30:25,393 --> 00:30:30,663
Even though... even though I can see now?
