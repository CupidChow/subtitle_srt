1
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:46,588
I want to stay with her.

2
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:48,840
Even more so

3
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:51,342
now that I left her side.

4
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,012
If there is even one reason

5
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:55,930
for me to stay,

6
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,224
then please

7
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,810
help me find it.

8
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,773
I don't care where that road leads me.

9
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:08,026
I will gladly go down that road.

10
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,295
You said you were going to manage well.

11
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:29,964
You said you'd show me
a great rendition of Giselle.

12
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:32,175
Was this it?

13
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:35,053
I just followed my heart, that's all.

14
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:37,347
There is someone
that you just cannot hate,

15
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,933
no matter how hard you try to hate them.

16
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:41,309
Is this still about Kim Dan?

17
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,727
Is he the problem?

18
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,230
Pull yourself together.

19
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,065
I've gone through a breakup too.

20
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,567
I had to say goodbye to someone dear to me

21
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:50,777
and have gone crazy before.

22
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,986
I've been through that too.

23
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,114
I'm saying those emotions

24
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,324
that you feel right now
are nothing special.

25
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:58,409
Then you must know this well.

26
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,161
I believe this is correct.

27
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,955
I get angry, then I resent him.

28
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:03,832
But in the end, I just miss him.

29
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:06,292
-And that's why I'm sad.
-You can never

30
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,211
get anything done with sadness!

31
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:11,798
If Giselle and Albrecht were
truly in love,

32
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,801
then they should die together in the end.

33
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,305
It must be her.

34
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,808
The one who has been put
to rest in the temple.

35
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,393
The ballerina.

36
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:25,687
That's unnecessary.

37
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,480
That has nothing to do
with the performance.

38
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,399
Please

39
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,943
do not disappoint me anymore.

40
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:57,343
KIM DAN

41
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:16,487
MESSAGES
NOISY GONG

42
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:24,787
MISSED CALLS
NOISY GONG

43
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:26,748
Hey, Noisy Gong.

44
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:28,917
Walk around freely now.

45
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,669
Go dance and lose your temper too.

46
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,175
How dare you save my name as Noisy Gong?

47
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,101
All right. Come to me.

48
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:54,859
Just look at me.

49
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,986
Just imagine

50
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,113
that it's only you and me in this world.

51
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:23,179
You have a runny nose.

52
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,752
I knew it. I can never sleep well

53
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,879
whenever I sleep in a different place.

54
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,260
I want to go home.

55
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,223
Isn't it a bit too late?

56
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,820
The secretary quit
just because he wanted to,

57
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:23,239
and the boss's heart
is shaken to the core.

58
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:25,450
Goodness, my poor life.

59
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:29,579
What's wrong?

60
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:30,997
What is it?

61
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,082
You already know that your hired hands

62
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,792
clean up this place
in the morning and night.

63
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,377
Why did you turn this place upside down?

64
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:37,503
Go back to sleep.

65
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:38,588
I can do this alone.

66
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,466
Did you have a dream
about the man who must not be named?

67
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,595
I can't believe this.

68
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,472
I thought you looked fine for a few days.

69
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,349
I did have a dream.

70
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:52,852
But it's not like that.

71
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,313
Clean more.

72
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,482
Until all the dust
and your regrets disappear,

73
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,025
vacuum as much as you want.

74
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,151
It's not like that.

75
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,532
I dreamt of my childhood days.

76
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:09,410
"Childhood days"?

77
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:10,828
When?

78
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,455
Why?

79
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:14,999
I'm not sure.

80
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:17,043
Why did he appear in my dreams?

81
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:19,879
I had completely forgotten about him.

82
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:21,964
It's probably because you're in distress.

83
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,633
You have no one to rely on.

84
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,387
You should get some fresh air.

85
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,223
Reminisce the good, old days.

86
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,725
If possible, meet an old friend too.

87
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,268
The audition is right around the corner.

88
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,270
That's why you need to be
in the right state of mind.

89
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,106
I'm already in the right state of mind.

90
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,651
How can you say that when you're
torturing yourself this late at night?

91
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,863
Every time you were in distress,

92
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,990
that place gave you peace.

93
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:49,450
Who knows?

94
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,077
You might magically find

95
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,830
a solution there once again.

96
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,048
Where are you?

97
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,466
I called the office.

98
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:06,884
I'm going to take the day off.

99
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:08,136
Where are you?

100
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,763
Let's talk. I'll explain everything.

101
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:14,475
About why it had to be a tragedy
and why it had to be you.

102
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:16,602
I wish

103
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,564
I could dream the same dream as yours.

104
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:22,150
But you know very well

105
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,360
that we can't force it.

106
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,280
I'll start from square one.

107
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:32,118
So please reconsider my dance.

108
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:35,329
You haven't answered me.
Where are you? I'll go there.

109
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:36,789
I'll see you later.

110
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:01,981
I'll go this way.

111
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,525
The way that'll make you look pitiful?

112
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,613
You're only going
to lose your woman that way.

113
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:09,864
She'll be disgusted.

114
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,620
I thought you were very determined,
but you're actually indecisive.

115
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,413
What should I do?

116
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,999
Should I burn everything down?

117
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,668
Or should I drown them all?

118
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,467
Who are you? Where are you from?

119
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,095
You have a temper.

120
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,642
Hey, do you know me?

121
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,228
You shouldn't pick fights with anyone.

122
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,021
Get a hold of yourself.

123
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,192
I came here to find out

124
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:49,028
if you deserve to be there.

125
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,598
LEE YEON-SEO, YOO SEONG-U

126
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:39,662
Why

127
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,291
are you here?

128
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:48,838
I came to look for something.

129
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:53,259
The thing is, I prayed about something.
I wanted to know the reason.

130
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,469
And

131
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,763
I realized what it was.

132
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,559
But it pains me.

133
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,228
What are you talking about?

134
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,522
Well...

135
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,192
-It's--
-Forget it.

136
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,944
You don't need to tell me.

137
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,035
Don't follow me.

138
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:21,245
Pray or do whatever you need to do.

139
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,538
And I'll do what I need to do.

140
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,349
How could he seriously not follow me?

141
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,604
Fine.

142
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,439
I don't know you either.

143
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:50,358
We're strangers.

144
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:01,118
LEE YEON-SEO, YOO SEONG-U

145
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,671
Welcome. Do you need a room?

146
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,714
LODGING

147
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,843
I have something to ask you.

148
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:21,347
Do you know the house with a blue gate?

149
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:24,892
It's been too long,
so I don't know the way.

150
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,937
There are many houses with blue gates.

151
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:29,438
A long time ago...

152
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,774
About a decade ago,

153
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,901
a little boy used to live there.

154
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,946
By the way, you look familiar.

155
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,948
Who are you? Are you a celebrity?

156
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,032
No, ma'am.

157
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,742
I'm a ballerina.

158
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,036
I came here before.

159
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,332
You visited for several years.

160
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,544
You danced in front of the villagers.

161
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,004
There were children as well.

162
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:56,715
I'm looking for someone
whom I met back then.

163
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,634
Tell me in detail.

164
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:00,344
That way, I can help.

165
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,019
I met him

166
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:11,814
on a rainy day.

167
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:15,025
There was a sun-shower
during my first day here.

168
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:19,029
I came out because it sounded like music.

169
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,282
And then,

170
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,033
I saw him.

171
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,076
He was standing

172
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,745
over a cliff.

173
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:29,957
I wanted to die.

174
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,961
I thought it'd be better if I died.

175
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,423
I was merely 12 years old.

176
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:38,883
Hey, you over there!

177
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:41,594
Be careful!

178
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:50,769
And then,

179
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:54,482
I met you.

180
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:16,670
I'm Yeon-seo. Lee Yeon-seo.

181
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,088
What about you?

182
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:19,632
My name is

183
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,009
Seong-u.

184
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:23,802
Yoo Seong-u.

185
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:29,391
Seven, eight, nine, ten.

186
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,769
I'm coming for you!

187
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,104
Where are you?

188
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:38,901
You scared me!

189
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:51,413
You can see better now, right?

190
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:55,000
You kept on falling because your bangs
were covering your face.

191
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:56,835
Thanks.

192
00:13:58,796 --> 00:13:59,797
Hey!

193
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:01,757
Is that me?

194
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,676
You're awful at drawing.

195
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,386
It's not you.

196
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,187
Is that it?

197
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,690
You two hung out for a couple of days?

198
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,400
Goodness.

199
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:22,069
-What is it?
-What's going on?

200
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,280
She's looking for someone after ten years.

201
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,948
He's a boy named Seong-u who used to live

202
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,449
in the house with the blue gate.

203
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:29,827
Is today a special day?

204
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,954
Is this some kind of a treasure hunt?

205
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:35,749
If that's all you two did, that boy
will probably not remember you.

206
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,711
No. Unless he's suffering
from a memory loss,

207
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,462
he will remember me.

208
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,256
Oh, my. How are you so confident?

209
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,094
No! I don't want to!

210
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:49,305
I was told to go to Russia
out of the blue.

211
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,098
I will never go.

212
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:52,725
I don't want to.

213
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,352
I'm going to quit doing ballet too.
I hate everything.

214
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,147
What would have a 12-year-old known?

215
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,566
I didn't want to be apart from my parents.

216
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:03,402
I didn't want to say goodbye
to my very first friend.

217
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,487
So I just hid.

218
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,119
You have a runny nose.

219
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,020
That's amazing.

220
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,647
I can't believe
you're going abroad to dance.

221
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,148
Are you even listening to me?

222
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,817
I will never go.

223
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,654
You said you enjoyed dancing.

224
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,073
You wanted to become
the best ballerina worldwide.

225
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:51,200
If I go there, I won't be coming back.

226
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,203
You might not be able to
see me for the rest of your life.

227
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,080
I'll write to you.

228
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:03,921
How could you not have seen a rainbow
in your entire life?

229
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:07,049
I'll show you the rainbow.

230
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:33,659
Why are you crying?

231
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,079
Were you disappointed?

232
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:42,793
That was so pretty.

233
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:47,256
That was the prettiest thing
I've ever seen.

234
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,514
I wanted to live
for the first time in my life

235
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,058
after meeting you.

236
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:00,728
Because you were beautiful.

237
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:04,606
Because I wanted to see
more of that beauty.

238
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,235
He understood what I wanted
to say with my dance.

239
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,653
He taught me

240
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,740
how my dance could touch

241
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,241
someone's heart.

242
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,003
I wanted to become a grown-up.

243
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,214
And as a strong and powerful grown-up,

244
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:33,260
I wanted to protect her.

245
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,262
I really want to

246
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,264
meet him again.

247
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,021
It's him. He's the guy
from the house with the blue gate.

248
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,815
He had those big black gleaming eyes.

249
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,943
That's him. Do you know him?
His name is Seong-u. Yoo Seong-u.

250
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,571
Hasn't it been over a decade
since that house became vacant?

251
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,531
Did he move? Where did he move to?

252
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:55,783
Do you happen to know his number?

253
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:57,743
I don't know.

254
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:00,079
He just disappeared one day.

255
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,623
My gosh, you're so forgetful.

256
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,041
How many times must I tell you?

257
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,876
That boy died.

258
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,586
Wasn't that the boy?

259
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:08,962
That's right.

260
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,214
What are you talking about?

261
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,007
Why would he die?

262
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:18,847
No.

263
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,101
Why?

264
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,104
Why?

265
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,775
How did you hurt your arm?

266
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,568
I fell.

267
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:34,571
His dad used to hit that boy.

268
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:37,282
That's why he jumped into the sea.

269
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,827
The police came to arrest his dad later.

270
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,578
But his dad

271
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,081
packed up his stuff and left the island.

272
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:46,625
Exactly. Poor kid.

273
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,711
-No.
-I wish I was wrong.

274
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,548
That's why I forget that all the time.

275
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,550
I forget about it
because it's too horrible.

276
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,764
You little jerk.

277
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,436
You little rat.

278
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:10,983
You come back here.
I'll teach you a lesson.

279
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,542
Darn it. That rat!

280
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,336
Where did you go?

281
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:58,173
As you instructed, I looked into
each dancer's family and finances.

282
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,347
I knew I could rely on you.
You're the best, Mr. Park.

283
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,140
Why do you need this now?

284
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:11,019
It's natural for a general director
to be interested in her dancers.

285
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,605
Every vote from each dancer
is very valuable.

286
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,400
I ought to look out for them
and take good care of them too.

287
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,111
Are you planning to buy their votes

288
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:20,946
for the audition?

289
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:22,531
Why would you describe it like that?

290
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,574
I'm just supporting them.

291
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,077
That sounds scary, you know.

292
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:41,216
You've done so much for me, Mr. Park.

293
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,927
I have been inattentive
to you lately, haven't I?

294
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,220
What's this?

295
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,556
I heard that your second child
will be starting school this fall.

296
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,433
It's been a while since you've seen them.

297
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:52,269
Why don't you go to England
and see your kids?

298
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,855
Well, let's see.

299
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,481
Three months will be enough, right?

300
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,777
And don't worry,
this will be a paid vacation.

301
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:01,695
If I go,

302
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,489
will you get rid of me
before anyone finds out?

303
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:07,951
Just like what happened to
Moon Ji-ung three years ago?

304
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:09,244
Mr. Park.

305
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,538
-Why would you bring him up now?
-General Director Choi.

306
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:13,498
Even a worm will turn.

307
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:16,293
And a rat can bite a cat
when it's cornered.

308
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,671
-Mr. Park.
-Please

309
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,382
stop threatening me.

310
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:23,383
I mean it!

311
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,138
My gosh.

312
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,015
What did I do to him?

313
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:33,810
Is offering him a bonus
and paid vacation considered wrong?

314
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,030
Why isn't he here?

315
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,115
He's gone.

316
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,496
Why aren't you here, Seong-u?

317
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,551
What are you doing here?

318
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:26,363
He

319
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:29,449
died.

320
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,744
After I left,

321
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,165
he died.

322
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,877
He didn't even write back to me,

323
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:44,005
so I really hated him for it.

324
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:45,799
And

325
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:49,719
I had completely forgotten
about him afterward.

326
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:52,430
But

327
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:55,892
he...

328
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:02,691
It's not your fault.

329
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,568
Why didn't I know?

330
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:07,237
He didn't even have shoes on.

331
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:10,282
And he was standing there
when the waves were coming.

332
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:13,285
His hair was long and unkempt.

333
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:15,328
And his body was covered with bruises.

334
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,373
It's not your fault.

335
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:20,625
No.

336
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:22,627
It is my fault.

337
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,880
Everything was a sign.

338
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:28,717
But I didn't pick up on any.

339
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,388
When he was so determined
to become a grown-up,

340
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,182
I

341
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:38,476
laughed at him and teased him for it.

342
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:41,021
I told him that becoming a grown-up
was a natural thing for kids

343
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:43,106
and he didn't have to try to be one.

344
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:44,733
But for him,

345
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:46,735
it was...

346
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:22,312
Don't beat yourself up for it.

347
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:24,439
It was probably

348
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,150
his destiny.

349
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:28,860
Destiny?

350
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:32,948
That's simple and brutal.

351
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:37,410
He must've been scared
and terrified his whole life.

352
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:39,621
I can't imagine how scared

353
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:43,583
he must've been to his last moment.

354
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:46,753
Just thinking about it makes me crazy.

355
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:50,840
Destiny?

356
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,136
No, that boy, Seong-u...

357
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:57,847
That kid

358
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:02,811
probably thought of you

359
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:05,647
at the last moment.

360
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:08,400
And to the very last moment,

361
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:10,860
to the last breath that he took.

362
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,196
How

363
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:15,699
do you know?

364
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,247
I just thought that was probably the case.

365
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:26,459
The only good memories he had were
probably the moments with you.

366
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,628
I'm sure he thought of you.

367
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:31,214
I'm sure.

368
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,384
Really?

369
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:38,471
I'm sure he's thankful until this day
knowing that you are the only one

370
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,142
who remembers him.

371
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,882
I'm sorry I'm late, Seong-u.

372
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,760
I didn't know.

373
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:20,889
I couldn't even imagine
that happened. I'm so...

374
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,642
I'm so sorry.

375
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,154
Why aren't you praying?

376
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:39,616
Will you ask the deity
that you like so much?

377
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,494
Why did He give

378
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,538
so much pain to the life of a 12-year-old?

379
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:48,625
If the deity really exists,

380
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,296
I'm sure there is no way

381
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,636
he would have been left alone to the end.

382
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:01,638
You're right.

383
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:06,059
Why was He

384
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:08,478
so harsh?

385
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,013
I'm sorry.

386
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:46,891
For what?

387
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,351
For everything.

388
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:51,563
For saying mean things
and hurting you on that day.

389
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,481
For now.

390
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:55,233
For everything.

391
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,360
That means

392
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,947
you won't come with me.

393
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:06,369
You can't

394
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:09,164
do this to me too.

395
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,335
My mom, dad, Mr. Cho,

396
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,172
and even Seong-u.

397
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:22,302
Everyone whom I loved

398
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,805
passed away first and left me here alone.

399
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,475
I couldn't even say a proper goodbye.

400
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,103
Do you know what it feels like
to be left behind?

401
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:37,358
It feels like I'm abandoned alone
in an endless desert.

402
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:38,985
So

403
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,070
can't you

404
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:44,365
please stay by my side?

405
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:51,247
Do you remember

406
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:54,042
how you were going to grant my wish?

407
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:55,877
Grant me three wishes.

408
00:29:56,878 --> 00:30:00,632
You should grant them
without saying a word.

409
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,635
I'll use the second wish out of the three

410
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:06,346
right now.

411
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:09,182
Why are you suddenly bringing up a wish?

412
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:10,934
Give me some time.

413
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,352
Just a little.

414
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,021
If you give me just a bit of time,

415
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:18,149
I'll figure out everything and go back.

416
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,027
So don't ask me anything right now.

417
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,862
What do you have to figure out?

418
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,072
What is it?

419
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,950
I have to know what it is to help.
That's how I can do something.

420
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:28,243
What is it?

421
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:32,622
This is

422
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:35,708
that thing

423
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,462
you gave me
to help me be all right without you.

424
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:40,421
I promise.

425
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:42,423
It won't take long.

426
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:44,884
I will come back.

427
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:47,053
Until then, eat well,

428
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,680
practice well,

429
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,515
and be brave.

430
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:53,935
That's my wish.

431
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:58,356
Can you do that?

432
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:14,015
Director Ji, what brings you--

433
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,145
Stop crying because of that jerk.

434
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,440
What do you think you're doing?

435
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:24,901
That's enough.

436
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:28,279
Don't waste your heart on a guy
who continuously runs away.

437
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:30,031
I know you depended on him

438
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,950
when you were ill and weak.

439
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,451
But not anymore.

440
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:35,662
I will not let you cry
over a guy like him.

441
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:38,206
-Who do you think you are--
-Lean on me.

442
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,000
I won't run away

443
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,711
or disappear.

444
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:50,301
Let me make myself clear.

445
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:52,637
You'll make me uncomfortable
if you keep this up.

446
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,055
I know you helped me make my comeback

447
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:56,307
and that you brought me to where I am now.

448
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:57,517
I'm grateful for that.

449
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,352
But you did that as a director.

450
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:01,688
Do not cross the line.

451
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,607
No matter who I choose
to depend on or who I cry over,

452
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:05,817
that's my choice.

453
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,987
You don't have any right
to meddle with my feelings.

454
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:11,739
I hope

455
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,200
something like this never happens again.

456
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:17,328
Let me apologize if I startled you.

457
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,790
But I cannot promise
that it won't happen again.

458
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,293
I meant it when I told you to lean on me.

459
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,045
-Director Ji.
-I will

460
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:28,673
stop here for today.

461
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:30,383
Let's go.

462
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,161
Thank you for giving me a ride.

463
00:33:58,327 --> 00:33:59,412
Goodnight.

464
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:03,374
Yeon-seo.

465
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:05,710
I'll see you at practice.

466
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:48,795
THE LATE CHOI SEOL-HUI

467
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:56,511
You once told me
that life is full of surprises.

468
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,264
I had no idea

469
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,102
this day would come.

470
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,437
I thought

471
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:08,606
I'd always roam around

472
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,317
like a ghost,

473
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:12,944
neither alive

474
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:15,947
nor dead.

475
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:18,825
I guess

476
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,160
I've also become

477
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:23,371
a trivial human being.

478
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:34,715
Give me some time.

479
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,634
I promise.

480
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:09,834
Is this your answer

481
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,213
to my prayer?

482
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:24,140
Why were you only watching me?

483
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:26,893
Why did you make me die
in the midst of pain?

484
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,146
Why did you even let me

485
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,231
be born?

486
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:36,903
Why did you let me

487
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:39,822
remember everything?

488
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,851
I have the documents regarding
the new secretary ready for you.

489
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:10,978
I'm thinking about holding
an interview next week.

490
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:11,896
Cancel it.

491
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,816
I know you trust me so much,

492
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,778
but I seriously can't live here.

493
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:19,946
Dan

494
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:21,906
is going to come back.

495
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,533
Are we allowed to say his name again?

496
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,118
Can I say,

497
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:27,787
"Kim Dan"?

498
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:30,998
Hold on. Did he call you?

499
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,877
He said he'll return.

500
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:36,671
He promised me.

501
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,756
This is unbelievable. When?

502
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,633
When will he come back?

503
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,134
I'm not sure about that.

504
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,471
Anyway, I don't need a new secretary.

505
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:46,806
I'm going to wait for him.

506
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:50,893
Look at her.

507
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:54,188
Was that what you got for your solution?

508
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:02,405
We need to talk.

509
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:09,954
Watch how you act.

510
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:11,455
What?

511
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:16,168
Just because the corps is back,
it doesn't mean they're on your side.

512
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,879
I know that.
I can feel it during practice.

513
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,881
Then you should've been
more careful with your actions.

514
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:24,010
You ditched practice
and met with Director Ji in private.

515
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,137
What do you think
everyone would think of you?

516
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,305
What?

517
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:29,348
Are you saying
he and I are seeing each other?

518
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:32,268
If that's the case, just be honest--

519
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:33,477
Don't be ridiculous.

520
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,022
It's nothing like that.

521
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:40,484
You gave us no choice.

522
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,653
We went on a strike because Director Ji

523
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,947
was abnormally persistent
about choosing you.

524
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,450
You just need to be careful.

525
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:50,411
If you jeopardize the corps'
relationship with Director Ji--

526
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:51,370
Keum Ni-na.

527
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,707
Do you like him?

528
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:00,046
What did you say?

529
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,547
That's ridiculous.

530
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,924
I just have great respect for him.

531
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:04,842
You're terrible

532
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:06,761
at hiding your feelings.

533
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:10,181
Don't bark up the wrong tree
just because you feel upset.

534
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:11,140
I'm...

535
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,350
I'm just

536
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,186
Right.

537
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,357
I'm doing this because I can't condone
such a dirty rumor spreading in Fantasia.

538
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:22,234
Then how about you stop babbling to me
and find those who spread that rumor?

539
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:25,905
I've never adopted an expedient
or did anything shameful.

540
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,073
I don't need to.

541
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:29,742
What is this?

542
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:36,749
It's nothing.

543
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:38,459
We were just...

544
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:41,879
There's a rumor
about you and I being lovers.

545
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:45,883
I think you just need to do
what I asked of you.

546
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:46,884
You do remember it, right?

547
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:49,512
I told you that I won't be able to.

548
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,890
Please don't bring your emotions
into work. Let's be professional.

549
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:53,974
Don't you worry about that.

550
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:00,648
Who spread such a ridiculous rumor?

551
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,109
Well...

552
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,425
All right. Let's start on the barre.

553
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:44,483
Drop your shoulders.

554
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:12,845
Dad, why are you out here?

555
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,181
I was waiting for you.

556
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,849
I haven't been able to see you these days.

557
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:18,934
Dad.

558
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,229
Drink some broth.

559
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:24,565
Your body needs to be warm
in order to be energized.

560
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:25,774
Thanks, Dad.

561
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:30,905
It's hard, isn't it?

562
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:36,118
Don't torture yourself
because of Yeon-seo.

563
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:37,828
She's a poor kid.

564
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:40,664
You always say that.

565
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:42,750
She isn't poor.

566
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,710
She's pretty, wealthy, and talented.

567
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:48,506
I'm certain that the deity only loves her.

568
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,300
If the deity truly did love her that much,

569
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,553
He wouldn't have taken her parents
away from her that early.

570
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:58,807
What good is it that she's pretty,
wealthy, and talented?

571
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,893
She went through a horrific experience.

572
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,437
She's an unlucky, miserable girl.

573
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,314
So Ni-na,

574
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:08,234
you should take care of her.

575
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:11,445
Whose side are you on?

576
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,739
I'm forever on yours,

577
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:16,909
so I need you to be on her side.

578
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:18,953
I don't want to.

579
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,873
This is my first time being
in a real competition against her.

580
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,209
I can't be on her side.

581
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:30,506
There's a reason why karma exists.

582
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:33,801
No matter what you do,

583
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:38,138
whether it's good or bad,
it'll all come back.

584
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:40,849
You and Ru-na

585
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:43,394
must be safe.

586
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,105
What do you mean?

587
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,319
You guys need to be kindhearted
like you are now.

588
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,585
You want all of them?

589
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:10,170
There aren't many people in the corps.

590
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:13,257
Three to four days will be enough, right?

591
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:15,551
This is a hassle.

592
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:19,680
I wish there was a simpler
and more effective way.

593
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:22,850
I've considered appointing new judges,

594
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,644
but we sounded very confident
in front of the corps.

595
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:28,355
Gaining their votes one by one
is quicker and more effective.

596
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:31,692
Let me ask my associate director
for this one favor.

597
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:33,652
Okay, General Director Choi.

598
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:36,572
Let's target Hwang Jeong-eun first.

599
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:40,451
As the oldest of the corps,
if we win her over, many more will follow.

600
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:46,749
Then it's Su-ji.

601
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:49,335
She's a poor girl who tutors several
students to make ends meet.

602
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:59,470
If we win over the lead's male partner,

603
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:00,846
it'll be convenient in many ways.

604
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,847
Are you well, Dan?

605
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:49,395
You can't sleep?

606
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:52,231
Not really. It's raining.

607
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,775
Would you like some tea too?

608
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,110
On a night like this,

609
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:58,570
a bowl of fish cake soup
and soju will hit the spot.

610
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:01,698
Do you want a drink?

611
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:09,331
I like drinking alone.

612
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:10,958
You can go back in.

613
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,218
Ms. Jung. If a guy

614
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:25,222
tells you to wait for him
and that he needs some time,

615
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:28,684
what does that really mean?

616
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:29,977
Ms. Lee,

617
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:31,812
are you seeing someone?

618
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:33,355
No, no.

619
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:36,316
My friend asked me for my opinion.

620
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:40,237
You are more experienced
in this field than I am.

621
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:44,283
I just wanted to give her
a better opinion.

622
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:45,993
Is he married?

623
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:47,703
No.

624
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:51,832
-Is he?
-Run away.

625
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:55,461
What do you mean?

626
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:56,545
Men

627
00:45:57,921 --> 00:45:59,798
never hesitate when it comes to love.

628
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:01,133
He needs more time?

629
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:02,801
And he's going into his man cave?

630
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:04,511
That's a load of nonsense.

631
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:07,306
He looked really desperate

632
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:08,891
according to my friend.

633
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:11,310
He gave her a handkerchief
he really cherishes.

634
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:12,936
That's a token of his promise to her.

635
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,938
To her, it may be a token of his promise,

636
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:17,024
but to him, it might be just trash.

637
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:24,364
Ms. Lee.

638
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:26,408
I don't know who that man is,

639
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:28,035
but give up on him.

640
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,204
That was about my friend.

641
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:31,955
I know you don't have friends.

642
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:33,957
I do have friends.

643
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:35,417
Why won't you believe me?

644
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:45,219
I should look for another secretary.

645
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:48,055
Gosh, she catches on fast.

646
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:51,433
Dan.

647
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:55,020
Where are you? What are you up to?

648
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:59,816
SANATORIUM

649
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:21,838
ROOM 105,
YOO JONG-CHEOL, MALE, 58 YEARS OLD

650
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:24,216
You little brat.

651
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:25,926
YOO JONG-CHEOL

652
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:26,843
Come here!

653
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:01,628
You ungrateful brat.

654
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:05,048
How dare you talk back to me?

655
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:12,723
You foolish one.

656
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:16,476
Those who abuse children

657
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:18,520
and trample on one's life

658
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:21,398
will face a bolt of lightning.

659
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:26,236
Why?

660
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:28,905
You're going to hit me again?

661
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,116
Go ahead.

662
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:34,995
Hit me mercilessly just like you did
in the past!

663
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:38,832
Why did you do it?

664
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:40,626
Why on earth did you do it?

665
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:44,171
I was your son.

666
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:47,883
I was...

667
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:52,971
I was only 12 years old.

668
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:56,266
How have you been living your life
after running away?

669
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:57,809
How did you end up here?

670
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:02,147
What about your life?

671
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:05,317
What about your son's life?

672
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:10,280
Look where you are now.

673
00:49:16,953 --> 00:49:19,081
I'm sorry.

674
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:23,877
I've wronged you.

675
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:32,761
I'm sorry.

676
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:37,933
I've wronged you.

677
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,018
Stop it.

678
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:42,479
Stop. Stop it.

679
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:44,272
Stop it!

680
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:51,947
I am

681
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:55,909
sorry.

682
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,644
His apology won't make any difference now.

683
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:25,230
He shouldn't have committed sins
from the start.

684
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:27,691
I'm furious.

685
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:29,401
I'm livid.

686
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:32,738
That's how humans are.

687
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:35,949
They make a mistake, regret it,
and repent of their mistakes.

688
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:40,495
That man has lived his whole life,
repenting of his sins.

689
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:42,080
He donated everything he saved

690
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:43,749
for the benefits of children.

691
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:46,418
He's been volunteering
at this hospital for 13 years.

692
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:50,005
As he didn't look after himself,
his body started to fail five years ago.

693
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:51,465
That won't

694
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:53,633
bring back the dead boy.

695
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:56,052
But he was able to save a child
who could've died.

696
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:58,096
I guess his good deeds paid off.

697
00:50:58,638 --> 00:50:59,681
At the end,

698
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:02,017
he was able to make an apology,

699
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,435
which he thought was impossible.

700
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:09,649
What do you want

701
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:11,943
from me?

702
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:16,114
Let's say that he did.

703
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:17,616
I was a human.

704
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:20,368
I had an unfortunate life by His design
and faced an unfortunate death too.

705
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:21,953
I should never have found out then.

706
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:24,414
Why did He let me remember this?

707
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:27,000
Why did He make me meet Yeon-seo
when I can't tell her who I am?

708
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,335
I'm sure you know

709
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,837
the deity always prepares an answer.

710
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:34,132
It's just that we're too blind
to see His answer.

711
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:37,511
Let's go to church for now.

712
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:38,845
Let's pray together.

713
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:42,724
-I won't go back.
-Hey, Dan.

714
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:44,476
He gave me a new riddle.

715
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:47,062
I'm going to find an answer on my own.

716
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:00,700
Take care, Hu.

717
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:03,286
Are you thinking of--

718
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,872
It really must have been
so hard for you to handle

719
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,542
a troublemaker like myself all this time.

720
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:10,335
I thank you for every moment.

721
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:12,379
I respected you.

722
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:44,870
Do you still have
unfinished business left on Earth?

723
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:48,665
Kim Dan. No.

724
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:50,542
Angel Dan.

725
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:52,502
Don't be so surprised.

726
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:55,463
I'll give you a big surprise.

727
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:01,511
Look at you, doing whatever you want,
you reckless angel.

728
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:04,389
Who are you?

729
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:06,433
How could a human know
the secrets of our realm?

730
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:08,518
Let's go over this first.

731
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:09,644
What's your mission?

732
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:11,813
Why did you come to Yeon-seo?

733
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:13,648
Forget it.

734
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:15,567
Just don't ever show up again.

735
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:17,527
If you ever show your face
around Yeon-seo again,

736
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:18,570
Yeon-seo

737
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:23,241
will find out about the existence
of your strange and creepy world.

738
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:24,868
-Are you threatening me?
-It's a warning.

739
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:29,706
You're the one who told me

740
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:32,334
last time to make her happy.

741
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:35,086
I'll do it.

742
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:39,549
I'll stay by her side forever
and make her love and be happy.

743
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:40,800
So don't worry

744
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:42,469
and get lost.

745
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:54,314
Recording?

746
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:56,566
You're sure, right?

747
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:00,278
Good job.

748
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:02,906
I think she'll rig the audition too.

749
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:06,117
I'll gather the evidence.

750
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:07,535
Okay.

751
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:09,412
Mr. Park.

752
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:19,673
Did General Director Choi send you here?

753
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:21,299
No.

754
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:24,219
You and I used to come here
when you had a lot on your mind.

755
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:26,388
You should've answered my calls.

756
00:54:27,263 --> 00:54:28,139
Give it back.

757
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:32,936
Are you really going to
blow the whistle or something?

758
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:35,438
You once told me

759
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:37,482
that you feel stuck.

760
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:42,612
I decided to climb down this mountain.

761
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:46,241
It'll be a tough journey,
and it'll take me a while.

762
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:50,370
You do understand, don't you?

763
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:55,500
Why are you...

764
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:56,918
Why are you doing this?

765
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:58,503
Please don't do this.

766
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:01,965
Gwang-il, will you please...

767
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:04,551
Will you please help me this one time?

768
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:07,762
Ni-na's audition will be soon.

769
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:10,473
And her performance with Director Ji

770
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:12,267
is the opportunity of her lifetime.

771
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:13,893
You also know

772
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:16,896
that my daughter is innocent
and pure like white snow.

773
00:55:17,313 --> 00:55:19,107
She really didn't do anything wrong.

774
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:20,525
Of course, I know.

775
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:23,611
I know that Ni-na is too kind
to even kill a bug.

776
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:25,613
Just give us a little more time.

777
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:28,825
After this is all over,
after Giselle premieres,

778
00:55:29,325 --> 00:55:30,785
you won't have to step up.

779
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:32,287
I will turn myself in.

780
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:35,081
I will take the punishment.

781
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:37,959
Please, Gwang-il.

782
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:42,797
You're a dad too.
You know how I feel, don't you?

783
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:54,392
I'm sorry. Where were we?

784
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:58,063
So you were in the lighting team
three years ago, right?

785
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:00,732
Mr. Moon Ji-ung?

786
00:56:09,824 --> 00:56:11,785
My goodness.

787
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:12,911
I'm serious.

788
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:15,288
I'm an acquaintance of Ji Kang-woo,
and this is an emergency.

789
00:56:15,371 --> 00:56:17,248
But you said you don't even know
the room number.

790
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:18,833
There's something important in there.

791
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:20,960
I was going to call the police,
but I decided to let him--

792
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,837
No, forget it. You need to go.

793
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:25,548
Sir, it'll only take ten minutes.
No, seven, five minutes.

794
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:28,301
If you keep doing this,
I'll call the police.

795
00:56:28,384 --> 00:56:29,344
Will you please--

796
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:30,261
Hello.

797
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:33,181
Yes, hello, sir. Do you know this guy?

798
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:35,850
He keeps on insisting that he knows you.

799
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:39,813
-Well--
-He's a friend of mine.

800
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,440
-I'll get going. Goodbye.
-Of course.

801
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:54,285
I can explain.

802
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:57,622
Forget it. I don't need you to explain.

803
00:56:58,373 --> 00:56:59,624
Gosh, my eyes hurt.

804
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:01,042
-Hu.
-Follow me.

805
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:27,152
Oh, my goodness.

806
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:30,780
Thanks, Hu.

807
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:32,991
I have no idea why I'm doing this.

808
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:35,410
I think you rubbed off on me.

809
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:38,288
Ji Kang-woo definitely has a secret.

810
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:39,998
He isn't just a normal guy.

811
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:55,972
Hello.

812
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:05,106
KEUM KI-CHUN, CHOI YEONG-JA

813
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:07,609
PRIMA BALLERINA KEUM NI-NA,
LEE YEON-SEO

814
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:08,943
What is this?

815
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:14,824
CORNEA DONATION,
EYESIGHT RECOVERED

816
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,159
IVY MANSION,
3 YEARS AGO, SWAN LAKE

817
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:39,224
What now?

818
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:44,103
Please forgive me.

819
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:02,080
Isn't that Noisy Gong?

820
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:04,249
No.

821
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:06,376
She isn't

822
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:08,378
Yeon-seo.

823
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:11,965
Then who is it?

824
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,525
Now you disregard everything
and just break in?

825
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:33,736
Why did you deceive me?

826
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,406
She looks like her.

827
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:38,283
Is that why you're obsessed with her?

828
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:39,659
-Shut up.
-I thought you were

829
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:47,083
Yeon-seo's missing rib.

830
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:49,377
I believed you were her destiny.

831
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,505
Once Yeon-seo falls in love with her rib

832
00:59:52,964 --> 00:59:54,424
and finds happiness,

833
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:57,969
I thought I could return
to paradise in peace.

834
00:59:58,511 --> 00:59:59,929
Like I said, I'll do that.

835
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:03,558
Everything is settled. Mission success.

836
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:05,101
No, I don't need you.

837
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:07,061
You're out.

838
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:10,398
I waited to tell you
that the one who should

839
01:00:11,357 --> 01:00:14,027
stop lurking around her is you, not me.

840
01:00:14,652 --> 01:00:16,779
Listen to the angel's order

841
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:18,823
and obey.

842
01:00:22,535 --> 01:00:23,870
So what will you do now?

843
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:26,331
Are you

844
01:00:27,665 --> 01:00:29,167
going to be her rib?

845
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:30,668
It's none of your business.

846
01:00:31,085 --> 01:00:34,797
If I turn into dust or dissipate,
that's for me to deal with.

847
01:00:40,928 --> 01:00:42,597
You'll be very lucky
if you just dissipate.

848
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:45,016
You can't even imagine
what the punishment is like.

849
01:00:45,099 --> 01:00:47,769
Something horrifying will happen.

850
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:52,982
He'll come.

851
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:56,944
He won't come.

852
01:00:57,904 --> 01:00:58,780
He'll come.

853
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:01,658
He won't come.

854
01:01:01,949 --> 01:01:04,786
What is this? Forget it. This is wrong.

855
01:01:05,536 --> 01:01:07,455
I'll start with "He won't come."
He won't come.

856
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,166
He won't come.

857
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:12,168
He'll come.

858
01:01:13,878 --> 01:01:14,879
He won't come.

859
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:17,173
Darn it, these flowers.

860
01:01:36,734 --> 01:01:37,652
You're here.

861
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,488
I'm sorry I'm late.

862
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:48,246
Are you all finished?

863
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:51,833
You won't leave again, will you?

864
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:56,295
If you say that you'll quit again

865
01:01:56,754 --> 01:01:58,172
or disappear without telling me,

866
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:00,967
I'll kill you. Okay?

867
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:05,596
You can't get sick
without telling me either.

868
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:08,433
And you can't die when I'm not around.

869
01:02:09,934 --> 01:02:10,810
Okay?

870
01:02:13,938 --> 01:02:15,606
Why won't you say anything?

871
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:18,109
Promise me.

872
01:02:25,491 --> 01:02:27,744
You can't even imagine
what the punishment is like.

873
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:30,705
Something horrifying will happen.

874
01:02:33,124 --> 01:02:34,167
I love you.

875
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:38,504
I love you,

876
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:41,048
Yeon-seo.

877
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:41,901
It's not a crime to love a lot,

878
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:44,028
but it is a crime
to have too many secrets.

879
01:03:44,111 --> 01:03:45,196
Hey, Yeon-seo!

880
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:47,448
Ms. Lee.

881
01:03:47,698 --> 01:03:48,950
Goodness! Ms. Jung!

882
01:03:49,617 --> 01:03:52,954
Yeon-seo, listen carefully
to what I'm about to tell you.

883
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:55,540
Do you know what a guardian angel is?

884
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:59,836
The best thing that you can do for her
is to leave her side now.

885
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:03,673
I'm sure there is a way.
An angel could become a human too.

886
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:07,218
I wish Yeon-seo was dead.

887
01:04:07,301 --> 01:04:08,302
Yeon-seo!
