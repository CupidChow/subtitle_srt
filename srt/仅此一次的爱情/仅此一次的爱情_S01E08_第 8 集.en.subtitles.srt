1
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:53,720
Yeon-seo.

2
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,327
This is a dream, right?

3
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,121
Yes.

4
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,917
Then in this dream,

5
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,420
let's take pictures until we grow old.

6
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:30,548
Look forward.

7
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:35,470
Take it.

8
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:12,715
Goodness.

9
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,676
Let's sleep just a little longer.

10
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:16,386
I can sleep.

11
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:18,763
Continue.

12
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:21,766
Continue. Please continue.

13
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,268
Continue.

14
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:27,856
I should have slept just a minute longer.

15
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:30,316
Goodness, what's with me?

16
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,319
Yeon-seo, you must be insane.

17
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,672
I had some leftover ingredients,
so I made another one.

18
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:53,840
I can't just throw them away.

19
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:57,969
He'll figure it out, won't he?

20
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,066
You're here. Let's eat breakfast.

21
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,902
It's better than yesterday.

22
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,239
Where did you go out this early?

23
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,866
-Do you want water?
-Ms. Lee.

24
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,493
I have something to tell you.

25
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,746
It's really important.

26
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,209
-What is it?
-I...

27
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,671
want to quit my job.

28
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:35,715
I want to

29
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:37,592
move out.

30
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:39,761
What?

31
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,097
What are you talking about?

32
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,766
Thank you for everything.

33
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:58,446
Why?

34
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:01,324
You must have a reason.
Why are you suddenly doing this?

35
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,537
-I'm sorry.
-This is absurd.

36
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:07,830
What did you say to me?

37
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,666
I wouldn't be alone
no matter what I choose to do.

38
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,125
That you hated to see me suffer.

39
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,460
Were those all lies?

40
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:14,295
Did you change your mind in a day?

41
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,340
Why are you running away?

42
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,300
What are you afraid of?

43
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,344
My feelings.

44
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:23,888
And your feelings.

45
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,433
You aren't alone.

46
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,936
You have Ms. Jung and Director Ji too.

47
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,355
-You'll be fine without me--
-I heard you.

48
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:35,191
You said you like me.

49
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,069
You said, "How can I not like you?"

50
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,405
I...

51
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,074
cannot like you.

52
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,202
And I

53
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,997
can't stay by your side forever.

54
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:51,165
That really

55
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,293
breaks my heart.

56
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:55,837
Yeon-seo.

57
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:57,880
How can I

58
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,217
not like you?

59
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,996
Why can't you like me?

60
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,331
I'm not that big of a deal.

61
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,875
You're a human, and I'm just a human too.

62
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,378
I thought you would

63
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,130
muster up your courage.

64
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,340
I told myself
not to whine or be impatient.

65
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,051
Even if you say you don't like me,

66
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,054
people's actions always speak
more clearly than their words.

67
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:47,805
And you always...

68
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,768
You're the most beautiful when you dance.

69
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,313
You did this.

70
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:56,522
Great job.

71
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,113
You were so warm to me.

72
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:05,948
Weren't you?

73
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,537
Feelings for you...

74
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:14,874
Yes, I do have feelings for you.

75
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,959
But to me,

76
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,920
that's a deviation.

77
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,880
It's like getting some air.

78
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,924
Do you know how long forever is?

79
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,010
This was just a month or two
compared to that.

80
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:29,013
It's not even worth mentioning.

81
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,349
Then why did you say it is tough for you?

82
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:33,267
You said it is tough
because you can't like me,

83
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,895
-but you do.
-Forget it. It was the alcohol talking.

84
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,773
What I said while I was drunk
doesn't have any meanings.

85
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,068
-What?
-I was your assistant for

86
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,695
physical activities,
but you can walk well and even dance now.

87
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,197
You don't

88
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:49,325
need me anymore.

89
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,412
Are you

90
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:55,414
finished?

91
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:58,751
Yes.

92
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,048
You're right.

93
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,592
You have always been useless.

94
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:08,553
I must have been delusional.

95
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,680
Fine, you can quit.

96
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,181
While we're on the topic,

97
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,684
you can pack up your things
and leave right now!

98
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,362
What's going on, Ms. Lee?

99
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,948
Take his resignation
and let him go immediately.

100
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,784
Count the days he worked here,
calculate the number of hours he worked

101
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,494
and give him everything he deserves.

102
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,288
Make sure we don't owe him anything,

103
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,165
so I won't have to see him again!

104
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:55,266
What's going on between you two?

105
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:56,851
You two aren't even dating,

106
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,270
but you two are
playing games periodically.

107
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,397
It's the second time in this room.

108
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,232
I won't be coming back.

109
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:07,487
You can quit, but you have to
hand over your duties.

110
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,113
The contract says that you have to tell us

111
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,282
a month prior to your resignation,
and you have to hand over

112
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:12,533
the duties to your replacement.

113
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,285
Ms. Lee told me to leave immediately.

114
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:15,369
Goodness.

115
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:18,289
Since when did you
listen to what she says?

116
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,608
Just go.

117
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:15,346
Hey.

118
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,432
You and Yeon-seo
belong in two different worlds.

119
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,726
I know that more than anyone.

120
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,273
I bet you can't lie.

121
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:30,528
SECRETARY KIM DAN

122
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,869
Where are you? Let's meet up.

123
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,289
Director Ji, it's Ms. Jung.

124
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,582
Why did you pick up?

125
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,709
Is Dan not there?

126
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,085
Well...

127
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,421
Dan resigned.

128
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,799
He returned his phone, pager,
and everything we gave him.

129
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,634
Today? Just like that?

130
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:57,138
They had squabbled and talked about
firing and returning,

131
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:58,556
but I guess this time it's real.

132
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,559
He left in a hurry without handing over

133
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,394
his responsibilities,
as if he was being chased.

134
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,646
I don't know what happened between them.

135
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:12,653
He talked about happiness

136
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:15,573
and acted like he'd be around forever.

137
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,409
But he quit?

138
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:00,743
It's said that a fire will burn the forest

139
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,454
and become a blaze
that swallows the mountain.

140
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:07,083
You must take refuge
until the fire burns out.

141
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:22,723
Hello, brother.

142
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,684
You're back.

143
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:32,066
You come at night and also in the morning.

144
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:33,943
You must be very devout.

145
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:37,905
Or is it that you're full of worry?

146
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:39,907
A priest

147
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,326
shouldn't talk like a fortune-teller.

148
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:46,539
I'm looking for someone.
Kim Dan. Where is he?

149
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:48,999
I don't know.

150
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,626
Wait.

151
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,837
Brother.

152
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,818
Why do you not believe me?

153
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,570
Dan's not here.

154
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,489
When you're consumed by doubt,

155
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,492
you don't believe soybean paste
is made with soybeans.

156
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,871
A man who doubts too much
can only be unhappy.

157
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,747
Yes.

158
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,666
Doubting and guessing.

159
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,710
It's exhausting.

160
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,004
I like things to be clear.

161
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:40,342
Then I pray that
you recover your faith soon.

162
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:44,138
Yes. That's why I plan to

163
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,433
be strong and check.

164
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:10,581
I will accept this gift from you.

165
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:11,540
I was right.

166
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,335
I knew you weren't a normal priest.

167
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,254
At the store, church, here and there.

168
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,590
You were busy looking out for
your junior angel.

169
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,928
What are you doing to Lee Yeon-seo?

170
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:27,389
It's not something
a mere human can handle.

171
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,768
You all think you're all so special.

172
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,478
You look down on the struggling humans

173
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,355
and manipulate them
with the snap of your fingers.

174
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:37,775
That makes you feel like
the omniscient and omnipotent deity.

175
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,693
You're mistaken.

176
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:44,406
Why are you not surprised?

177
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:48,327
When facing a heavenly being,
humans tremble in fear

178
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,870
and cannot make eye contact.

179
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,623
But instead of trembling in fear,

180
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:53,874
you are angry.

181
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:55,417
Why is that?

182
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:59,421
Ask your petty deity why I'm like this.

183
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:02,466
And whether it's Yeon-seo or Dan,

184
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:04,885
if the deity wants to ruin my plans again,

185
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:07,888
tell Him to wake up as well.

186
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,650
He's not just any rib.

187
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,372
What are you thinking?

188
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,959
Can Dan handle this?

189
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,193
Can I say, "at last"?

190
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,782
We get to stand side by side
and face Fantasia.

191
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:09,867
At last.

192
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,452
Yes.

193
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,164
I thought the day would never come.

194
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,167
Congratulations
on your return, officially.

195
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,462
Thank you, officially.

196
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,762
Isn't it just for show?

197
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,889
Director Ji will judge our auditions.

198
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:34,350
Yes. I think we quit protesting too soon.

199
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,935
-Right?
-I think so.

200
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,736
What? Do you have something to say?

201
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,112
You have a private changing room.

202
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,740
I won't use that.

203
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,075
We still have to audition.

204
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,786
I don't expect special treatment.

205
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:03,754
She barges in and expects
one of us to empty a locker.

206
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,928
Not mine. I used it for over two years.

207
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,556
Me too. I even put stickers on my locker.

208
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,864
I'll use this one.

209
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,492
Thank you all for coming.

210
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,327
I hope we get along.

211
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,562
Good morning.

212
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,605
-Hello.
-Hello.

213
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,985
Warm up properly
and we'll start on the barre.

214
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,003
Why are you here?
We'll begin practice soon.

215
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:29,006
Before you start practicing for Giselle,

216
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:33,177
I came to see our spineless dancers.

217
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,054
Did you enjoy your break?

218
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,434
But then, you did nothing wrong.

219
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:43,896
I'm on your side.
You know that, don't you?

220
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:45,689
For that reason,

221
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:48,567
Associate Director Keum
will make an important announcement.

222
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,277
This is for your sake.

223
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,573
The audition to pick the lead for Giselle

224
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,742
will take place in two weeks
in the grand theater.

225
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,869
The artistic staff
such as the general director

226
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,621
and associate director will judge you.

227
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,039
And

228
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,669
Artistic Director Ji Kang-woo
will be off the panel.

229
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:10,881
What is she saying?

230
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,550
What do you mean by that?

231
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:16,887
I can't pick the lead
of the performance I'm directing?

232
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,722
As you know,

233
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,768
you are incapable of being impartial.

234
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:27,064
You wanted an equal and fair audition.

235
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,733
Do you object, Yeon-seo?

236
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:40,244
Very well. I won't be on the panel.

237
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,245
But then

238
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,789
you should also step down.

239
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,041
You also are incapable of being impartial.

240
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:50,045
How about we let
the dancers judge each other?

241
00:18:56,969 --> 00:19:01,014
In what audition in the world
do you let dancers judge each other?

242
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,057
Why can't we?

243
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,102
It's transparent and fair.
We can let everyone vote.

244
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:06,854
You said you're on their side.

245
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:21,618
All right then.

246
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:24,621
What an interesting audition this will be.

247
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:28,167
And I'm sure this will go down
in the history of Fantasia.

248
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,137
You can't announce something
like that without discussing it

249
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,096
with me first.

250
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:44,224
It's you who's plotting against me
with Yeon-seo

251
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,851
behind my back.

252
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,478
Fantasia isn't some corner shop
you can find at a market.

253
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:49,771
It was her who suggested

254
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,274
having an audition
without discussing it with me.

255
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,026
She persuaded the corps

256
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,694
in the most reasonable way.

257
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:56,778
Is there a problem?

258
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,198
Or do you want there to be a problem?

259
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,824
Please watch your language.

260
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,327
Because you stubbornly
didn't listen to us,

261
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,078
the press conference and Fantasia's Night

262
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,330
were totally ruined.

263
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,706
Have you forgotten?

264
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,291
General Director Choi

265
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,627
had to jump through hoops
in order to clean up the mess.

266
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,671
Associate Director Keum, that's enough.

267
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,758
I'm not sure about that.
Actually, I only remember her

268
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:20,344
making it worse than it has to be
and driving Yeon-seo into a corner.

269
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,304
But I'll trust you a little more

270
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:23,847
because

271
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,308
she and I have the same goal.

272
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,101
Look forward to the show.

273
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,818
Why did you get him all riled up?
What's your plan?

274
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:38,904
No matter how distinguished he is,

275
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,697
he's just an artistic director.

276
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,201
I can't put up with the way he treats us.

277
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,669
All right. We'll start Giselle.

278
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,087
Act One.

279
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:38,880
We'll start

280
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,257
from the coincidental meeting

281
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,718
between a country girl, Giselle,
and Duke Albrecht.

282
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,392
I know you're right there!

283
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,731
When they recognized each other,

284
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,190
they fell in love.

285
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,526
It has been like that since the beginning.

286
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,779
The feeling was so intense
that they wanted to call it

287
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,197
a destiny.

288
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:10,912
However,

289
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:13,498
when Giselle found out
the man's true identity,

290
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,001
she died from a heart attack

291
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,377
with the sense of betrayal.

292
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:29,514
However, they couldn't stop
loving each other even after death.

293
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,269
And they met again.

294
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:35,937
Like destiny.

295
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,272
Lee Yeon-seo.

296
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:42,235
What did I just say?

297
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,159
I have never heard of Giselle
being interpreted as a tragedy.

298
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,244
Giselle is known as
the symbol of forgiveness.

299
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:54,581
The highlight of the story is that
she saves Albrecht even in death.

300
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:57,292
I wouldn't have started this project
if it was going to be predictable.

301
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:00,921
Why would she forgive the man
who deceived her and caused her to die?

302
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,464
That story is too outdated.

303
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,299
In Act Two of our Giselle,

304
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:08,095
the spirit of Giselle
is going to kill the man

305
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,097
who drove her into death.

306
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:11,848
As two of them dance

307
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:15,352
together in the world of eternal death,

308
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:17,187
the show ends.

309
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,152
That's nice.

310
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,321
The man deceived her.

311
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:28,240
But Giselle acted like a fool to the end.

312
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,950
I didn't like that part.

313
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,619
I like that ending.

314
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:38,333
We'll start from the grave scene.

315
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:53,473
Hey!

316
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:54,558
Hey, no!

317
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:13,285
What's taking him so long?

318
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:15,996
GENERAL MANAGER PARK GWANG-IL

319
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:27,090
Mr. Park.

320
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:30,594
Mr. Park?

321
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:32,637
Mr. Park.

322
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:34,806
Mr. Park!

323
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:36,308
Mr. Park!

324
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:38,018
I'm sorry!

325
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,020
Mr. Park.

326
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:41,980
Hey.

327
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:46,318
So you're telling me that someone
snatched the bag with all the evidence

328
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:47,611
you gathered so far?

329
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:49,905
Do you expect me to believe that?

330
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,323
I'm really sorry.

331
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:52,407
What about the backup?

332
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,492
I'm sure you must have saved
the originals somewhere else.

333
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,119
I'm sure someone is watching me.

334
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,537
They won't leave me alone.

335
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:58,747
Mr. Park!

336
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:00,624
Get yourself together.

337
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,626
If you don't gather up your courage,

338
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:05,629
you'll have to live in hell forever.

339
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,214
I'm sorry.

340
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:09,174
-I'm sorry, Ms. Jung.
-Mr. Park.

341
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:11,468
Mr. Park!

342
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,437
STATEMENT

343
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,358
I doubt that he'll try to do anything now.

344
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:28,151
I'll keep watching him.

345
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,487
When there is an earthquake
and the ground is shaking,

346
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,072
covering your head

347
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:34,449
and hiding under the desk
is the right thing to do.

348
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:39,204
Still, he should've stayed under the desk.

349
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,997
That way, he wouldn't have
to face the damage.

350
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,040
Good job.

351
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:59,307
SANATORIUM

352
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,445
I didn't think you'd come back.

353
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,116
I wanted to see her one last time.

354
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:19,661
I might end up going somewhere far.

355
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:21,204
That's so nice of you.

356
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,290
I was going to call you anyway.

357
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:26,334
It was hectic that day.
I didn't get to thank you properly.

358
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:29,087
If you weren't there,
things may have gone wrong.

359
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,840
And you know the old man, Kim Su?

360
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,675
I think he might have lost his footing.

361
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:36,094
We couldn't find
his body or any traces of him.

362
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:37,804
Did you see anything that day?

363
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:43,226
He might have gone somewhere far.

364
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:44,728
You think so?

365
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:48,356
He did come back a year ago
out of the blue too.

366
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,192
A year ago?

367
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:52,569
Not 30 years?

368
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:56,573
My gosh, you must've done this a lot.
You're a pro.

369
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:59,034
When I see Mi-ok

370
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,703
eating delicious food and chewing it
with that small mouth,

371
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:04,080
I'm the happiest.

372
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,542
I can't imagine that.

373
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,461
Loving someone during your entire life.

374
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:12,297
You don't need to spend a long time
for it to be true love.

375
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:13,673
Even if it's for a year, if you can

376
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:16,384
give her love that can amount to
1,000 years' worth of love, that's enough.

377
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:20,263
Let me go get the doctor.

378
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:27,270
Ma'am.

379
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:32,067
I'm here. Can you hear my voice?

380
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,155
-Let me take a look.
-Okay.

381
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:45,830
No, ma'am.

382
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:48,792
You can do just fine even if you're blind.

383
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,585
I'll help you.

384
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,025
I think I'm lost.

385
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:16,778
It's as if I'm

386
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:19,572
at a blocked dead end.

387
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:23,743
Wherever I go,

388
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:25,954
I see her.

389
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:28,832
Where

390
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,960
should I go?

391
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:34,838
Don't go anywhere.

392
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,632
Stay here.

393
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:48,643
Hey.

394
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:50,937
What is he...

395
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:57,610
Hey, Dan. It's really nice here.

396
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:00,113
You can do volunteer work here
for a few days--

397
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:02,741
Don't talk to me.
I don't want to talk to you.

398
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:05,660
How dare you?

399
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,579
How could you even come here?

400
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,959
"Judgment without mercy will be shown

401
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,878
to anyone who has not been merciful."

402
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,005
You look like you might even punch me.

403
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,965
If you were trying to scare me,
it was very effective.

404
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:21,384
I got scared and ran away like a coward.

405
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,011
You did the right thing.

406
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:26,556
It's the best thing you did
since you got your mission.

407
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:29,392
The biggest hindrance
to accomplish the mission is yourself.

408
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,145
You said you'd work
on your backlogged reports.

409
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,481
How great is it? This is the time.

410
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,274
Look forward to this report.

411
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,985
I'll mention your cruelty
and violence in detail.

412
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:45,241
Work will be fun for once.

413
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,913
Stay away from Noisy Gong
and lie low for a while.

414
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:51,414
Oh, and also

415
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,583
stay away from Ji Kang-woo.

416
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:56,294
I won't, so stop nagging and go away.

417
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,588
If you say any more,

418
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:01,424
I might really want to retaliate.

419
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:37,502
What are you doing, Mom?

420
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,006
Where's the tape measure?

421
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:43,675
I want to measure something.

422
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:57,814
Here you go.

423
00:30:57,897 --> 00:30:58,940
Yes.

424
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,415
Ru-na.

425
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:18,209
Let's have a drink. Come on out.

426
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:31,347
AFFIDAVIT

427
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:42,150
You never required much work
even as a child.

428
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,402
I'm so grateful for that.

429
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:46,279
Having Ni-na learn ballet

430
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:49,157
and managing Fantasia
took me away from you.

431
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:51,326
I never had any complaints.

432
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:54,370
I liked how grand you looked at your job.

433
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:56,873
You never brought any friends home

434
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:59,542
and always braided Ni-na's hair for fun.

435
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,377
You looked after her instead of me.

436
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:04,047
I didn't care for the other kids.

437
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:07,884
Ni-na was so pretty
so it was fun dressing her up.

438
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:10,470
Is something the matter?

439
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,972
Why are you talking about that?

440
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,265
Was it you?

441
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,393
Did you try to kill Yeon-seo?

442
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:20,313
Mom?

443
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:22,148
What?

444
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:24,567
Never mind.

445
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:27,528
You seem to be on edge these days.

446
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:29,447
Ru-na.

447
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,283
I want you to see good things

448
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,285
and go to nice places.

449
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,412
I'll do everything else.

450
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:41,960
You know that I hate getting dirty.

451
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:43,294
No!

452
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,964
We can't hurt someone
to live high off the hog!

453
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,549
What are you talking about?

454
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:51,928
That day on the boat,
you had Mr. Park drug her.

455
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:53,054
Be quiet.

456
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:56,140
Mr. Park spilled the drink
so she didn't get to drink it.

457
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,893
Then what about Mr. Cho?
Mr. Park told me everything.

458
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:02,230
Mr. Cho's car that crashed.
The brake line was snapped.

459
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:04,774
Then

460
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,694
someone caused the accident on purpose?

461
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,737
To kill Mr. Cho and Yeon-seo?

462
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:12,448
It wasn't you?

463
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:15,118
Shall I peel another apple?

464
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,527
KIM HYUNG-MIN

465
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,237
HANGUK UNIVERSITY,
BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION

466
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,115
He's just not good enough.

467
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:56,034
Ms. Jung.

468
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:00,204
Are you done? How's the atmosphere?

469
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:03,624
I'm dead curious
but you won't let me into the room.

470
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,045
It's fine. Everyone's nice to me.

471
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,087
What a lie.

472
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:13,259
Humans are so strange. Why do you lie?

473
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,474
What's wrong with me?

474
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,310
Ms. Lee. Do you feel sick?

475
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:26,064
Ms. Jung.

476
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:28,357
You go ahead.

477
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:30,610
-What?
-I have to go somewhere.

478
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:32,320
You can go home.

479
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,988
Wait, where are you going?

480
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:35,114
Ms. Lee.

481
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:40,620
Where could she be possibly going
when she only comes here or stays home?

482
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,396
My gosh.

483
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,525
That idiot keeps leading people here.

484
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,572
You asked for the head priest?

485
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,076
Do you know Kim Dan?

486
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:22,078
Oh dear, Father.

487
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,249
He worked at my place. This

488
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,293
was the address he put on his resume.

489
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:32,380
How could he give a church's address?

490
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,589
What's wrong with that?

491
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:36,050
He was born and raised here.

492
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,553
He said he had a father who threw him out.

493
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:41,139
You know what we people mean
when we say "father."

494
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,021
How could this be?

495
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:52,108
How can I not know anything about him?

496
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:54,694
Where he was born, who his parents are,

497
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:58,030
how he grew up,
what he dreamed of becoming.

498
00:35:58,447 --> 00:35:59,574
Don't look for him.

499
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,994
It's just that the time has come.

500
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,620
The beginning and the end.

501
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,539
Human beings cannot tell.

502
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:10,793
Only when it is over do they realize

503
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,671
that their time is up and that it's over.

504
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:34,358
Where are you? Seriously.

505
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:49,332
-Director Ji.
-Are you looking for Dan?

506
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:52,460
Let's go.

507
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:54,795
Where to?

508
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:57,340
To get over him.

509
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:14,440
No, don't drink.

510
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,159
Make today the last day

511
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:27,662
of having regrets and looking back.

512
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:30,581
Don't jump to conclusions.

513
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:32,208
No one's having regrets.

514
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:35,503
I could tell you were distracted
throughout today's practice.

515
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,214
When someone close leaves suddenly,

516
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,132
it shocks you.

517
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:43,344
I get that but remember one thing.

518
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,553
Kim Dan

519
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,473
may not be the person you think he is.

520
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,478
What do you mean? What do I think of him?

521
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:53,688
What is Dan like?

522
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,773
It's more than what you see.

523
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:59,193
Perhaps he might be deceiving you.

524
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,696
So forget about him and get over it.

525
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,907
Why are you badmouthing him after he left?

526
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:08,536
Yes, I don't know anything about him.
I realized that even more after he left.

527
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,621
But I know this for sure.

528
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:13,374
Dan isn't a sly guy who deceives people.

529
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:16,127
I've never seen someone who was

530
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,838
as transparent as he was.

531
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:23,175
You must be worried
that I won't do well on Giselle.

532
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:24,385
Don't worry.

533
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,470
I performed within a month after
my parents passed away.

534
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,014
And I received a standing ovation for it.

535
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:02,173
What did you expect?

536
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:06,802
Did you think he'd be sitting here
like the first day you met him?

537
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:12,767
Kim Dan.

538
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:15,811
Where are you?

539
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:17,646
Where?

540
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:22,360
Wherever I go, I always see you.

541
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,528
I saw you at the bar too.

542
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,447
I can't even go home now.

543
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:29,241
Now that you're gone,

544
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,495
everything has gotten messy.

545
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:34,538
Dan.

546
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:37,833
I need you.

547
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,503
I need you.

548
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:45,508
Get a grip, Yeon-seo.

549
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:01,190
Is that

550
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:03,275
really you?

551
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,612
Dan, is that

552
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:08,447
really you?

553
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:09,740
You were right.

554
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:11,492
It was my mistake.

555
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,786
I shouldn't have been nice to you.

556
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,373
I was a tiny bit nice to you,
and you're so smitten.

557
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:19,959
I didn't know that
it'd be this easy to win you over.

558
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,586
Can't you understand?

559
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,256
I was focused on my work,
and it was only a brief moment.

560
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:27,716
I just got carried away
for a brief moment.

561
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:32,471
Because you were such a spoiled ice queen,
I was just doing you a favor.

562
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:36,684
Don't get hung up on someone like me.

563
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,019
Find someone who's really on your side.

564
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:41,021
Find someone who will stay
with you to the end.

565
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:43,107
Got that?

566
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:49,488
Stop it.

567
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:51,449
Let go.

568
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:55,453
I'll go first.

569
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,040
I won't see

570
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:02,543
you leave ever again.

571
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:04,628
It was always you who ran away first.

572
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:07,381
You did that at my house and the park.

573
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:10,718
Not this time.

574
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,055
Remember this.

575
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:17,057
I'm

576
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:19,393
leaving you.

577
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,521
It's you who will be

578
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:25,107
left alone.

579
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,421
He didn't exist.

580
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:50,424
He never existed.

581
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:52,801
Although he existed,

582
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,388
pretend that he never existed.

583
00:41:57,556 --> 00:41:58,641
That's what I'll do.

584
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,060
I can do this.

585
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:04,730
I can do this. I can do it.

586
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:09,652
Say something to me.

587
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:14,865
What do you want me to do?

588
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,477
Is that me? You're awful at drawing.

589
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:45,062
It's not you.

590
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:08,502
Stop dreaming, human.

591
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:11,005
Stop having useless dreams.

592
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:29,523
Ma'am.

593
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:31,567
Ma'am!

594
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:36,530
Call my old man.

595
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,076
Call my old man.

596
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:44,163
Call my old man!

597
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:46,999
Why isn't this working?

598
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:49,501
Gosh, why isn't this working?

599
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,172
Ma'am.

600
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:55,799
Is that you?

601
00:43:56,717 --> 00:44:00,095
My gosh, this is incredible.

602
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:02,348
It wasn't working before.

603
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,725
This thing really called you here.

604
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:07,728
Wait...

605
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:12,316
I'm...

606
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:13,817
In my dream,

607
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:17,738
I went to a beautiful field of reeds.

608
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:21,492
I was holding hands with you.

609
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:22,743
And we walked together.

610
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,745
It was beautiful.

611
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:28,582
Can you take me there?

612
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:29,541
Pardon?

613
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:31,043
To where?

614
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:32,294
There.

615
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:37,758
That field of reeds.

616
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:41,845
Do you remember

617
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:44,973
the day we met for the first time?

618
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:47,101
How was it?

619
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:51,105
You lied.

620
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:02,074
Is that you?

621
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,495
You're wearing the white suit

622
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:08,789
that you had on for our wedding.

623
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:14,586
What am I going to do?

624
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:18,841
I've aged too much.

625
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:21,885
Don't I look ugly?

626
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:24,888
You look beautiful

627
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:27,099
just like that day.

628
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:37,067
Thank you

629
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:39,278
for lying.

630
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:43,615
I was happy

631
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:45,993
every single day.

632
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,163
I was truly happy

633
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:53,000
that I could do that.

634
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:58,881
Are you all right?
Let's go back to the sanatorium now.

635
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:03,093
Thank you, young man

636
00:46:04,636 --> 00:46:07,306
for what you've done that day and today.

637
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:10,309
Do you know who I am?

638
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:12,644
Is your memory back?

639
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:16,064
I only wish
that everything was all a dream.

640
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:19,026
I thought I braced myself for it.

641
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:22,863
During the 70 years of my life,

642
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:25,824
I've had so many goodbyes.

643
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:27,826
But saying goodbye

644
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:31,038
is hard every time, you know.

645
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:36,084
It was here.

646
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,086
This was the spot, right?

647
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:46,178
He only left behind

648
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:49,139
this handkerchief with a feather on it.

649
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:51,808
This is the only thing he left behind.

650
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,816
His body disappeared
as if he was never here.

651
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:04,238
How futile this is.

652
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:10,369
Please come to this world
as a human in your next life.

653
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:13,872
I will be your guardian angel.

654
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:16,542
Did you know

655
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:18,544
that he was an angel?

656
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:22,005
Weren't you scared?

657
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:24,258
He's not a human.

658
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:26,426
He's like a spirit or a monster.

659
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:29,721
No monsters in this world
can be as kind hearted as he was.

660
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:32,307
When I said

661
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:36,061
that he was my husband
who passed away 30 years ago,

662
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,189
he played along and said that he was.

663
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:42,693
Every day for a year,

664
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:46,071
he lied to me with a kind heart.

665
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:49,241
You don't need to spend a long time
for it to be true love.

666
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:50,576
Even if it's for a year, if you can

667
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:53,328
give her love that can amount to
1,000 years' worth of love, that's enough.

668
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:55,789
How...

669
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:58,458
How can he be like that?

670
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:00,711
I...

671
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:03,422
ran away.

672
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:06,008
I was scared.

673
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,427
Of vanishing?

674
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:10,512
No.

675
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,058
I was afraid I would hold onto her.

676
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:20,022
When I'm with her, I want to hold her hand

677
00:48:20,772 --> 00:48:22,107
and give her a hug.

678
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:25,777
But if I do that,

679
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:30,240
I thought I would make Yeon-seo sad.

680
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:35,329
I thought she might become unhappy.

681
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:41,835
I...

682
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:44,713
do not regret anything.

683
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:50,719
I'm sad.

684
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:55,390
I'm heartbroken.

685
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:03,190
But that's my destiny.

686
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,276
It was me.

687
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:10,405
I'm the one he came across.

688
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:12,366
I'm grateful.

689
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:16,078
I do not resent him.

690
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,124
You know what, young man?

691
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:27,214
When two people meet one another,
it's never meaningless.

692
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:31,259
I believe in destiny.

693
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,346
That is

694
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:38,100
what led us

695
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:41,812
to meet each other.

696
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:46,817
Ma'am.

697
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,235
Ma'am?

698
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:49,403
Ma'am!

699
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:55,826
Oh, no.

700
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:00,247
You can't pass away like this!

701
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:02,374
You can't!

702
00:50:28,024 --> 00:50:29,609
4. OTHER NOTES: A REQUEST FOR A LEAVE

703
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:31,445
You said we are a part of His big plans

704
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:33,321
and providence, didn't you?

705
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:36,491
Then was it a part of the plan

706
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:39,578
to take away the last hope
of someone who is

707
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:41,830
poor and lonely?

708
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:46,543
And what is the providence
for the one who refuses

709
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:48,211
to blame Him to the very end?

710
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:51,423
Does He have

711
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:56,094
a plan for me that He made
since the beginning of time?

712
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,431
I want to identify

713
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:02,225
the root of such feelings.

714
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:17,741
Let us begin the maiden scene.

715
00:51:18,074 --> 00:51:21,703
Please show your own depiction of Giselle.

716
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:32,464
Why Yeon-seo?

717
00:51:33,089 --> 00:51:34,007
Why did you

718
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:36,676
send me to her of all people?

719
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:38,595
Yes.

720
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:41,431
I did save her on a rainy day.

721
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:46,353
But

722
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:49,523
she recognized me first.

723
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:51,566
Why?

724
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:57,405
I want to stay with her.

725
00:51:58,740 --> 00:51:59,699
Even more so

726
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:02,410
now that I left her side.

727
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:04,621
If there is even one reason

728
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:06,581
for me to stay,

729
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:08,375
then please

730
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:10,961
help me find it.

731
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,380
I don't care where that road leads me.

732
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:15,048
I will gladly

733
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:17,300
go down that road.

734
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:20,220
Next.

735
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:41,408
You want me to cover my eyes?

736
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:42,492
Isn't it a tragedy?

737
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:46,037
You need to become the woman
who went blind from betrayal.

738
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:49,624
That's how you can run toward

739
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,751
the finale of revenge
that your director wants.

740
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:05,098
Nice try.

741
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:08,560
But are you going to do this on stage?

742
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:11,271
Mimicking the emotion
by using this blindfold

743
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:12,522
isn't genuine.

744
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:14,649
Next.

745
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:17,736
Lee Yeon-seo. Are you ready?

746
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:28,413
Why?

747
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:30,290
What are you doing?

748
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:32,542
Why are you showing me
Giselle from 200 years ago?

749
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:33,668
You told me

750
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:36,129
that you like the new Giselle.

751
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:38,924
I did that before, but I changed my mind.

752
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:39,841
That's not good.

753
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:41,176
Right now,

754
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:44,346
Giselle was betrayed.

755
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:47,432
She hit on him, began to date him,
and found out he was two-timing.

756
00:53:47,515 --> 00:53:50,060
How can you be so heartbroken?

757
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:51,186
Because she's sad.

758
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:54,856
I didn't know

759
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:58,944
you would depict Giselle
as such a passive character.

760
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:03,990
If you hate and curse someone,
you don't go crazy.

761
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:06,826
You have to be completely sane
if you wish to hate someone.

762
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:09,162
Do you know why she went crazy?

763
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:11,414
Because she's sad.

764
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:13,291
She was too sad.

765
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,126
She loved him that much.

766
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:17,629
That's exactly the classical
and old-fashioned Giselle!

767
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:19,464
Because you only look at her
from the outside!

768
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:22,592
If you go into the core,
her heart will make the audience cry.

769
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:26,054
I'll show you. Watch this.

770
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:55,625
I'm sad.

771
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:57,585
I'm sad.

772
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:03,591
I'm not done with my feelings,

773
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:06,594
but my love must come to an end.

774
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:08,179
You were right.

775
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:10,056
It was my mistake.

776
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:11,599
I shouldn't have been nice to you.

777
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:17,856
Why

778
00:55:19,315 --> 00:55:20,775
can't you be mine?

779
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:24,612
Why must everything disappear?

780
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:27,782
You have always been useless.

781
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,826
I must have been delusional.

782
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:31,327
While we're on the topic,

783
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:33,705
you can pack up your things
and leave right now!

784
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:08,907
I miss you.

785
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:11,785
I miss you.

786
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:14,013
KIM DAN

787
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:21,229
-What?
-Gosh, you and your temper.

788
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:22,772
-Stop it.
-Hello.

789
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:26,568
Are you here on a trip?

790
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:28,695
Do you need a room?

791
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:31,573
No, I'm looking for something.

792
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:34,409
Is there a rumor
that this is a treasure island?

793
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:40,623
Ma'am, have you lived
on this island for a long time?

794
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:43,960
Not very long. Just all my life.

795
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:47,881
Then do you know
the house with the blue gate?

796
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:49,507
A long time ago,

797
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:52,343
a boy who is this tall used to live there.

798
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:57,765
The blue gate house
on the hill over there?

799
00:57:58,516 --> 00:58:01,686
A little boy and his drunk father
used to live there,

800
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:03,855
but one day, they suddenly disappeared.

801
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:33,551
Gosh.

802
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:45,688
Come here, you little jerk!

803
00:58:47,398 --> 00:58:50,902
That little jerk.

804
00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:52,362
Darn it.

805
00:58:53,571 --> 00:58:55,615
You little jerk.

806
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:57,742
Where are you hiding?

807
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,746
This rain is already
making me sick and tired.

808
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:03,665
It's driving me insane.

809
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:21,307
Come here! Come out!

810
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:22,225
No!

811
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:55,592
Hey!

812
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:56,884
Hey!

813
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:00,972
Are you really going to be like this?

814
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:02,890
I'm leaving tomorrow.

815
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:05,810
I won't even be going to Seoul.
I'm going to Russia!

816
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:08,896
I'll get on a plane and go far away.

817
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:15,903
I know you're there.

818
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:22,327
Forget it.

819
01:00:22,535 --> 01:00:24,704
I don't want to be your friend anymore!

820
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,468
It wasn't a dream.

821
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:40,887
This kid...

822
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:43,431
existed in real life.

823
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,256
I was beaten up whenever it rained.

824
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:19,592
So

825
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:23,096
I never went out after it rained.

826
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:25,932
That's why I have never seen
a rainbow before.

827
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:30,061
The girl who showed me a rainbow
for the first time.

828
01:01:36,234 --> 01:01:38,111
I wanted to be a grown-up for her.

829
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:41,656
I didn't want to die.

830
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:44,200
I'm Yeon-seo.

831
01:01:44,325 --> 01:01:45,243
Lee Yeon-seo.

832
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:46,577
What about you?

833
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:48,329
I'm...

834
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:49,914
I'm...

835
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:51,958
My name is...

836
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:14,772
My name is

837
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,315
Seong-u.

838
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:17,275
Seong-u.

839
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:18,192
Yoo Seong-u.

840
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:19,610
Yoo Seong-u.

841
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:54,228
Why did you let me remember everything?

842
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:55,813
I'm so sorry.

843
01:02:56,856 --> 01:02:58,024
It won't take long.

844
01:02:58,107 --> 01:02:59,025
I promise.

845
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:01,652
If a guy tells you to wait for him
and that he needs some time...

846
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:02,820
Is he married?

847
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:04,530
Stop crying because of that jerk.

848
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:06,741
He's unbelievable.
He pretended to be so noble.

849
01:03:06,824 --> 01:03:08,826
Don't mind him
and don't even listen to him.

850
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:11,329
I will make her love and be happy,
so get lost.

851
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:12,789
I wanted to become a grown-up.

852
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:14,665
And as a strong and powerful grown-up,

853
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:16,125
I wanted to protect her.

854
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:18,753
What are you talking about?
Why would he die?

855
01:03:19,086 --> 01:03:21,130
Are you well, Dan?
