1
00:00:02,594 --> 00:00:08,634


2
00:00:42,234 --> 00:00:43,434
No!

3
00:00:50,834 --> 00:00:53,234
 No, don't go! 

4
00:00:53,234 --> 00:00:54,634
Don't go.

5
00:01:18,434 --> 00:01:20,234
Come out of there.

6
00:02:01,234 --> 00:02:04,634
Why are my dreams always in color? So annoying.

7
00:02:49,834 --> 00:02:51,034
Next.

8
00:02:51,634 --> 00:02:53,834
   

9
00:02:53,834 --> 00:02:55,134
Next.

10
00:02:55,834 --> 00:02:57,234
Next.

11
00:03:02,834 --> 00:03:04,434
Wait a minute.

12
00:03:06,434 --> 00:03:07,634
What are you doing right now?

13
00:03:07,634 --> 00:03:09,234
No one is saying that they know

14
00:03:09,234 --> 00:03:11,634
who put this stool in the bathroom

15
00:03:11,634 --> 00:03:15,434
in the perfect spot

16
00:03:15,434 --> 00:03:17,634
for me to fall.

17
00:03:17,634 --> 00:03:19,234
They should go through the same thing and learn

18
00:03:19,234 --> 00:03:24,834
that if someone who can not see trips over the stool they could crack their head and die.

19
00:03:29,734 --> 00:03:31,534
Is there still no one?

20
00:03:33,434 --> 00:03:35,934
Is it really a ghost who put it there?

21
00:03:36,994 --> 00:03:40,364
Okay. Everyone fired.

22
00:03:43,034 --> 00:03:46,634
One and two and three and...

23
00:03:46,634 --> 00:03:48,234
I did it!

24
00:03:48,234 --> 00:03:52,934
I know. There was a strong sense of cheap lavender smell from the stool.

25
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:58,034
The thing is that I put it there yesterday to organize the clothes.

26
00:03:58,034 --> 00:04:00,834
I didn't ask for the reason.

27
00:04:00,834 --> 00:04:05,134
I'm not curious about those kinds of excuses.

28
00:04:08,034 --> 00:04:10,934
Only lavender is fired.

29
00:04:19,234 --> 00:04:20,834
Good morning, y'all!

30
00:04:20,834 --> 00:04:22,434
Oh, you're here.

31
00:04:22,434 --> 00:04:26,634
It's because the head butler keeps leaving right on time, the employees keep making mistakes

32
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:29,434
I'll give you any room you want. Come live in the house.

33
00:04:29,434 --> 00:04:32,034
How would I bear you for 24 hours?

34
00:04:32,034 --> 00:04:36,434
Secretary Jo, you like her so you can endure. But I—

35
00:04:36,434 --> 00:04:37,234
Hate me?

36
00:04:37,234 --> 00:04:39,034
You already know.

37
00:04:39,034 --> 00:04:41,734
Here. Today's mail.

38
00:04:45,134 --> 00:04:46,684
Five.

39
00:04:48,834 --> 00:04:52,234
College, conference, donation.

40
00:04:52,234 --> 00:04:54,834
Pointless as usual.

41
00:04:54,834 --> 00:04:57,634
   

42
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:03,134
And the... er... the water bill.

43
00:05:05,634 --> 00:05:08,434
It's a flyer! Like the one hospitals send out.

44
00:05:11,034 --> 00:05:15,434
Our nation has made a lot of progress, to be able to send out advertisements in braille.

45
00:05:21,834 --> 00:05:24,634
"The Fantasia Cultural Foundation

46
00:05:24,634 --> 00:05:27,934
Twentieth Anniversary Party Invitation."

47
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:36,734
Was it that time already? I thought it was next week?

48
00:05:38,134 --> 00:05:43,134
You won't be attending regardless; your parents are quite... persistent.

49
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:46,334
Tuesday at 5:00.

50
00:05:49,234 --> 00:05:51,234
Tomorrow?

51
00:05:51,234 --> 00:05:52,834
 Lee Gu Reum! 

52
00:05:56,234 --> 00:05:57,834
Let's go together, all right?

53
00:05:57,834 --> 00:05:59,734
I can go alone.

54
00:06:01,024 --> 00:06:02,574
Jo Seung Hwan speaking.

55
00:06:03,234 --> 00:06:06,234
Yes, Doctor. The results?

56
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:10,234
This is Lee Yeon Seo.

57
00:06:10,234 --> 00:06:14,434
Tell me directly since I know who the cornea receiver is.

58
00:06:15,744 --> 00:06:19,754
What's the problem this time?

59
00:06:20,404 --> 00:06:22,994
Did the legal guardian oppose the donation at the last minute again,

60
00:06:23,654 --> 00:06:26,224
or did you find another infection?

61
00:06:26,224 --> 00:06:29,474
What's the mistake? What the problem again?

62
00:06:30,434 --> 00:06:36,634
Enough. Don't call me anymore, because I plan on withdrawing my name from the waitlist.

63
00:06:38,634 --> 00:06:41,434
Yes, Doctor. Please don't hang up. Hold on a moment.

64
00:06:42,744 --> 00:06:44,444
Leave it be.

65
00:06:45,834 --> 00:06:48,434
Secretary Jo, where are going dressed like that?

66
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:52,234
She'll feel better once she gets some fresh air and cools her head.

67
00:06:52,234 --> 00:06:55,834
I'd be angry in her position, too. It feels like they're playing a cruel joke every time.

68
00:06:55,834 --> 00:06:57,934
I think I need to stop by the hospital.

69
00:07:00,634 --> 00:07:05,434
You know what happened to Yeon Seo. After what happened with her eyes, she won't allow us to even mention ballet.

70
00:07:05,434 --> 00:07:09,734
And she's never once looked back at Fantasia. It's been this way for three years.

71
00:07:45,634 --> 00:07:49,034
Hello, sky. Hello, world.

72
00:07:50,634 --> 00:07:58,134
You have to be this beautiful even if I'm not here.

73
00:08:22,434 --> 00:08:29,834
♫  I will stay like how it is  ♫

74
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:36,034
♫  because of jealousy  ♫

75
00:08:42,434 --> 00:08:44,934
   

76
00:08:47,434 --> 00:08:50,234
You are a foolish man.

77
00:08:50,234 --> 00:08:53,234
You steal animals. You buy and sell lives.

78
00:08:53,234 --> 00:08:56,034
You are living a miserable life.

79
00:08:59,434 --> 00:09:02,834
What a pain! What use is this—

80
00:09:04,434 --> 00:09:06,434
What the— What is this?!

81
00:09:06,434 --> 00:09:08,634
Is it a ghost?!!

82
00:09:08,634 --> 00:09:11,034
More like an angel, you jerk!

83
00:09:11,034 --> 00:09:17,034
Live an upright life. If you behave as unattractively as you look, nothing good will come of it!

84
00:09:31,234 --> 00:09:33,634
What should I do??

85
00:09:35,034 --> 00:09:37,934
 Get away, you punk! 

86
00:09:39,214 --> 00:09:41,814
Are you ready, sir?

87
00:09:42,834 --> 00:09:44,234
Let's go.

88
00:09:50,634 --> 00:09:53,934
I pray that peace...

89
00:10:04,734 --> 00:10:07,134
I should go and receive my final mission now.

90
00:10:13,554 --> 00:10:15,584
   

91
00:10:19,404 --> 00:10:23,514
Since it's my last day, I request a great mission!

92
00:10:29,514 --> 00:10:31,584
Wait here a bit.

93
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:38,374
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

94
00:10:39,104 --> 00:10:41,634
Look where you're going!

95
00:10:43,714 --> 00:10:45,854
Did you fall?

96
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:48,594
What's this? Are you blind?

97
00:10:48,594 --> 00:10:53,994
Jeez, so annoying. If you're blind, you should just stay home quietly, instead of crawling out into the world to make trouble for others.

98
00:10:53,994 --> 00:10:55,984
You're a nuisance, don't you know?

99
00:10:55,984 --> 00:10:59,324
Don't get in the way of us normal people.

100
00:10:59,324 --> 00:11:01,824
- I'm sorry.
- You are, right?

101
00:11:01,824 --> 00:11:03,804
- Let's play together.
 - Who are you?

102
00:11:03,804 --> 00:11:06,034
I've seen you running here before.

103
00:11:06,034 --> 00:11:07,724
Why didn't you come with your butler today?

104
00:11:07,724 --> 00:11:11,024
Just passing shoulders, they say it's fate.

105
00:11:12,634 --> 00:11:14,554
Let's play.

106
00:11:14,554 --> 00:11:17,774
Have some. Drink it!

107
00:11:18,454 --> 00:11:20,274
This little--

108
00:11:21,884 --> 00:11:24,014
You're around 175cm.

109
00:11:24,014 --> 00:11:29,324
And you, you're a lot shorter. Are you even 170cm?

110
00:11:30,134 --> 00:11:34,754
If you lay a finger on me, I can't guarantee your safety.

111
00:11:34,754 --> 00:11:39,704
- Did you do some sports?
- Wow. That's why you are so sexy. Your back looks so—

112
00:11:39,704 --> 00:11:41,014
I warned you.

113
00:11:41,014 --> 00:11:43,824
Are you trying to fence with that thing? When you can't even see our faces?

114
00:11:43,824 --> 00:11:46,544
That's right. What's the point in living as a blind person?

115
00:11:46,544 --> 00:11:50,764
Such a pointless existence should do at least one good thing before it ends.

116
00:12:01,444 --> 00:12:03,984
Careful. An accident can happen in the blink of an eye.

117
00:12:03,984 --> 00:12:07,044
Do you think I'd ever imagine that I would be blind?

118
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:11,504
I'm not "blind" but "visually impaired."

119
00:12:12,504 --> 00:12:14,184
Say it after me.

120
00:12:14,184 --> 00:12:16,464
V-Visually impaired.

121
00:12:16,464 --> 00:12:19,114
"Blind" is a derogatory term for calling

122
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:23,634
someone who has lost their vision due to either congenital or acquired reasons.

123
00:12:23,634 --> 00:12:27,884
Do you even understand? You're worth far less than Gureum.

124
00:12:29,694 --> 00:12:30,884
Quick, let's go.

125
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:33,574
That little bitc-- !

126
00:13:07,034 --> 00:13:10,624
 The donor's final test results don't look too good. 

127
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:13,884
 A cornea transplant seems impossible. 

128
00:13:13,884 --> 00:13:19,684
 Jeez, so annoying. If you're blind, you should just stay home quietly, instead of crawling out into the world to make trouble for others. 

129
00:13:19,684 --> 00:13:24,454
 What is the point in living as a blind person? A pointless existence... 

130
00:13:36,364 --> 00:13:39,024
 Those pieces of trash! 

131
00:14:07,154 --> 00:14:11,714
You... died here once already, didn't you?

132
00:14:17,454 --> 00:14:19,784
 It's dangerous! 

133
00:14:23,414 --> 00:14:25,764
 Come down! 

134
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:27,744
 It's dangerous, please come down! 

135
00:14:27,744 --> 00:14:30,854
 I can do this much. 

136
00:14:30,854 --> 00:14:34,624
 I've done this more than a thousand times. I can do it with my eyes closed. 

137
00:14:40,764 --> 00:14:42,524
Whoa...

138
00:14:43,754 --> 00:14:46,194
How can it be like this?

139
00:14:51,384 --> 00:14:58,114
Mom. Dad. I really can't see a single thing.

140
00:15:12,554 --> 00:15:15,594
 They say a ballerina dies twice. 

141
00:15:15,594 --> 00:15:18,574
 The first time is when she gives up dancing. 

142
00:15:18,574 --> 00:15:21,314
 The second is when she stops breathing. 

143
00:15:21,314 --> 00:15:25,104
 When I stopped dancing, it was total darkness. 

144
00:15:25,104 --> 00:15:28,294
 Why should I wait around for my second death? 

145
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:33,264
 Why not experience both of my deaths at once? 

146
00:15:37,914 --> 00:15:43,474
♫  It's all right. It's all right.  ♫

147
00:15:43,474 --> 00:15:50,734
♫  Even if everything is lost  ♫

148
00:15:52,614 --> 00:15:57,954
♫  It's all right. It's all right  ♫

149
00:15:57,954 --> 00:16:05,454
♫   Someone is beside me  ♫

150
00:16:06,694 --> 00:16:10,404
♫  Even when I am crying...  ♫

151
00:16:11,594 --> 00:16:13,804
You foolish person.

152
00:16:13,804 --> 00:16:15,814
A human dies if she doesn't breathe.

153
00:16:15,814 --> 00:16:24,304
♫  The you who stays by my side  ♫

154
00:16:24,304 --> 00:16:27,544
♫  You are my angel  ♫

155
00:16:27,544 --> 00:16:34,394
♫  Oh, you are my angel always  ♫

156
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:38,524
♫  You're here  ♫

157
00:16:38,524 --> 00:16:42,154
♫  Oh, you are my angel ♫

158
00:16:42,154 --> 00:16:48,904
♫  Oh, you're by my side always  ♫

159
00:16:48,904 --> 00:16:55,634
♫  Always. Stay here forever...  ♫

160
00:17:23,654 --> 00:17:25,324
Who are you?

161
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:30,154
I asked, who are you?

162
00:17:31,294 --> 00:17:34,354
Why did you sit down without a word next to someone on a bench?

163
00:17:37,904 --> 00:17:39,914
Are you ignoring me?

164
00:17:43,754 --> 00:17:48,434
See, he isn't saying anything, even though he's right there!

165
00:17:50,064 --> 00:17:52,764
Not seeing isn't the same as not knowing!

166
00:17:52,764 --> 00:17:54,854
The only sense I lost is my sight, so

167
00:17:54,854 --> 00:17:57,094
my sense of smell, hearing, touch are just fine; and

168
00:17:57,094 --> 00:18:00,714
in fact, my lack of sight makes my sixth sense all the keener!!

169
00:18:00,714 --> 00:18:02,854
That's not it!!

170
00:18:02,854 --> 00:18:04,584
Did she hear me?

171
00:18:07,264 --> 00:18:09,194
No, she couldn't have.

172
00:18:09,194 --> 00:18:11,194
A man?

173
00:18:13,024 --> 00:18:16,294
What's this? You heard my words? You hear me?!

174
00:18:16,294 --> 00:18:19,764
Didn't I just tell you that my ears were fine?

175
00:18:19,764 --> 00:18:21,234
How can this be?!

176
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:25,824
That's what I should be saying? How can something like this happen to me twice in one day?

177
00:18:25,824 --> 00:18:28,464
What are you? A pickpocketer or a pervert?

178
00:18:28,464 --> 00:18:30,104
What are you after?

179
00:18:30,104 --> 00:18:33,874
I doubt that you sat next to a blind woman just to see the rain.

180
00:18:33,874 --> 00:18:34,984
That's not...

181
00:18:34,984 --> 00:18:36,594
Never mind.

182
00:18:36,634 --> 00:18:38,034
I've caught you so just leave.

183
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:40,834
If you keep bothering me, you'll get hurt.

184
00:18:41,914 --> 00:18:45,874
No. I don't want to!

185
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:47,664
What?!

186
00:18:50,054 --> 00:18:52,384
Neither you nor I own this bench.

187
00:18:52,384 --> 00:18:56,854
It belongs only to God in heaven. Am I wrong?

188
00:18:58,534 --> 00:19:01,664
Not a pickpocket or a thief,

189
00:19:01,664 --> 00:19:04,194
but a psycho cult member?

190
00:19:04,194 --> 00:19:07,024
How dare you!  You are only choosing ugly words!  Listen.

191
00:19:07,024 --> 00:19:09,444
Whatever binds you here, will continue to bind you up above.

192
00:19:09,444 --> 00:19:11,254
I don't buy it.

193
00:19:11,864 --> 00:19:15,734
Buddha, Jesus, or Allah. I don't buy into any of those beliefs.

194
00:19:16,674 --> 00:19:19,324
Those who deny God's existence will face—

195
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:22,484
Who said I'm denying it? God? Of course, He exists.

196
00:19:22,484 --> 00:19:25,884
It's just that He's a complete b*stard.

197
00:19:25,884 --> 00:19:28,004
"A complete bast—"

198
00:19:29,554 --> 00:19:31,564
Ye who blaspheme against God—

199
00:19:31,564 --> 00:19:33,934
He never listens to our prayers.

200
00:19:33,934 --> 00:19:36,844
He ignores us, even if it's just one measly wish.

201
00:19:36,844 --> 00:19:39,104
That my father could live for just one more day,

202
00:19:39,104 --> 00:19:42,644
that I could see him for just one second longer before he went to Heaven,

203
00:19:42,644 --> 00:19:45,804
He didn't answer even though I prayed for these things for eleven hours on an airplane, crying.

204
00:19:45,804 --> 00:19:49,534
When I asked that instead of my eyes, He can take just one of my legs.

205
00:19:49,534 --> 00:19:53,304
Because that way, I would at least be able to dance, He still pretended not to hear me,

206
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:57,444
that God you're so crazy for.

207
00:19:58,164 --> 00:20:02,634
Not everyone who encounters hardship becomes as twisted as you.

208
00:20:03,284 --> 00:20:07,004
Nor do they all jump off a bridge, as you did.

209
00:20:10,004 --> 00:20:12,044
Who are you?

210
00:20:14,294 --> 00:20:17,414
 - Did she just grab me?!!  
- You! I asked who you were!!

211
00:20:17,414 --> 00:20:19,164
Who sent you??!!

212
00:20:19,164 --> 00:20:21,824
 Miss! 

213
00:20:24,814 --> 00:20:27,304
Butler! Grab that man!!

214
00:20:27,304 --> 00:20:29,744
You see a young man leaving, right?

215
00:20:29,744 --> 00:20:31,714
Who? Who is it?

216
00:20:31,714 --> 00:20:35,464
Over there! He's leaving, get him. Quick!

217
00:20:38,684 --> 00:20:40,834
There's no one there.

218
00:20:42,784 --> 00:20:44,554
Just now, here, he was definitely...

219
00:20:44,554 --> 00:20:48,954
Are you... seeing a ghost right now?

220
00:21:10,384 --> 00:21:12,974
   

221
00:21:14,244 --> 00:21:15,124
   

222
00:21:15,124 --> 00:21:17,034
That side is hung too high.

223
00:21:17,034 --> 00:21:19,354
You came a day early.

224
00:21:19,354 --> 00:21:23,664
Have you been well, Secretary Jo?

225
00:21:23,664 --> 00:21:26,644
Tomorrow is the death anniversary of Yeon Seo's parents.

226
00:21:26,644 --> 00:21:29,094
I know. What of it?

227
00:21:29,094 --> 00:21:31,654
Did you really have to pick this date?

228
00:21:31,654 --> 00:21:35,824
If we're being precise about it, the actual 20th anniversary is next week.

229
00:21:35,824 --> 00:21:37,274
Is Yeon Seo coming?

230
00:21:37,274 --> 00:21:38,274
Director.

231
00:21:38,274 --> 00:21:42,894
She's been cooped up at home for three years. She never shows her face at the foundation's events.

232
00:21:42,894 --> 00:21:48,664
You have no idea how difficult it's been running such a large foundation in her stead,

233
00:21:48,664 --> 00:21:50,554
do you?

234
00:21:51,934 --> 00:21:53,534
I called her here to see

235
00:21:53,534 --> 00:21:57,734
just how well I've managed the foundation she rejected.

236
00:21:57,734 --> 00:22:02,084
Oh, wait, that's right. She wouldn't be able to see with those eyes.

237
00:22:02,084 --> 00:22:04,814
How pitiable she is, my niece.

238
00:22:04,814 --> 00:22:07,324
Yeon Seo will not be attending tomorrow.

239
00:22:07,324 --> 00:22:08,714
We sent a formal invitation.

240
00:22:08,714 --> 00:22:11,754
Let's get something clear. We are the ones being refused.

241
00:22:11,754 --> 00:22:12,884
But isn't it strange?

242
00:22:12,884 --> 00:22:17,734
I've been curious why we couldn't find a cornea donor, even though it's been three years.

243
00:22:17,734 --> 00:22:23,054
"It'll happen when it happens." And it's quite strange how they've all been canceled at the last minute.

244
00:22:23,054 --> 00:22:25,134
Maybe the donor's cells didn't match.

245
00:22:25,134 --> 00:22:27,354
What can I do? She's not lucky enough.

246
00:22:27,354 --> 00:22:30,834
And thanks to that, you remain where you are.

247
00:22:30,834 --> 00:22:32,704
Right?

248
00:22:35,304 --> 00:22:36,834
What's your point?

249
00:22:36,834 --> 00:22:41,944
It's interesting how one person's unhappiness can mean another person's luck.

250
00:22:46,444 --> 00:22:51,184
I'll be opening an investigation into the cancellation of the cornea transplant.

251
00:22:54,684 --> 00:22:57,174
Don't make this into a big thing. Everything was done by the waiting order.

252
00:22:57,174 --> 00:23:01,384
Of course. Who would interfere with such a thing on purpose?

253
00:23:01,384 --> 00:23:06,114
If there was someone like that, I wouldn't let them be.

254
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:33,624
So, how much have they found out?

255
00:23:33,624 --> 00:23:35,934
You can't go in. He's with a patient.

256
00:23:41,684 --> 00:23:45,584
He already talked to the administration and the donation center.

257
00:23:45,584 --> 00:23:48,544
What was I supposed to d—

258
00:23:49,754 --> 00:23:52,354
Hide the truth?

259
00:23:52,354 --> 00:23:57,864
So you told him the truth?

260
00:23:57,864 --> 00:23:59,994
Today, I pretended to not know anything.

261
00:23:59,994 --> 00:24:00,894
Today?

262
00:24:00,894 --> 00:24:04,184
This is hard for me. I'm a doctor, too.

263
00:24:04,184 --> 00:24:07,024
I came here to tell you that.

264
00:24:08,604 --> 00:24:11,674
Dr. Kim, do you think I'm unaware that you're a doctor?

265
00:24:11,674 --> 00:24:14,324
Because you're a doctor I'm speaking politely

266
00:24:14,324 --> 00:24:18,064
and treating you with respect.

267
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:22,054
I don't know anything, you know.

268
00:24:22,054 --> 00:24:27,494
The doctor takes care of the corneas, transplant, and other stuff.

269
00:24:27,494 --> 00:24:30,734
If an investigation takes place...

270
00:24:30,734 --> 00:24:34,604
No, that won't happen.

271
00:24:34,604 --> 00:24:36,354
It shouldn't happen.

272
00:24:36,354 --> 00:24:38,254
The investigation?

273
00:24:38,254 --> 00:24:39,694
Just keep this in mind.

274
00:24:39,694 --> 00:24:43,724
Dr. Kim, you have crossed a bridge

275
00:24:43,724 --> 00:24:46,264
and I have destroyed it.

276
00:24:47,164 --> 00:24:49,154
You can't go back now.

277
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,984
You've understood, right?

278
00:24:50,984 --> 00:24:52,824
Yes.

279
00:25:15,154 --> 00:25:19,744
 Not everyone behaves like you after experiencing a tragedy. 

280
00:25:20,854 --> 00:25:26,104
What wrong with him?  He's put me in a bad mood.

281
00:25:34,734 --> 00:25:36,964
I don't have a shadow

282
00:25:44,044 --> 00:25:46,524
and I can't be seen by people.

283
00:25:46,524 --> 00:25:48,694
How did that woman know then?

284
00:26:25,224 --> 00:26:28,104
My client, are you alive?

285
00:26:31,794 --> 00:26:34,264
What's going to happen to the cat?

286
00:26:34,264 --> 00:26:36,884
Sorry, cat. I didn't see you.

287
00:26:36,884 --> 00:26:40,464
Since we reported it, the matter will be well taken care of.

288
00:26:40,464 --> 00:26:43,684
Stop crying and drink some tea. If you cry, you'll run out of breath.

289
00:26:43,684 --> 00:26:48,254
Sis, turn the car around. What if it gets hit again before those people arrive?

290
00:26:48,254 --> 00:26:51,424
Let's go and bury it. We must.

291
00:26:57,194 --> 00:27:00,804
Geum Ni Na, please get a hold of yourself.

292
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:05,964
It was just an accident. You didn't kill it.

293
00:27:05,964 --> 00:27:07,214
But still...

294
00:27:07,214 --> 00:27:11,824
It just encountered a tragic event. 
 All tragedies in the world are like that.

295
00:27:11,824 --> 00:27:15,844
It suddenly comes and takes away everything.

296
00:27:15,844 --> 00:27:18,824
You must get rid of it before it does.

297
00:27:18,824 --> 00:27:20,894
Come back to your senses and get a hold of yourself.

298
00:27:20,894 --> 00:27:24,534
Your show's tomorrow, right? You can't let your mind or body be shaken by this.

299
00:27:24,534 --> 00:27:26,414
Sis...

300
00:27:27,504 --> 00:27:31,184
So drink this and

301
00:27:31,184 --> 00:27:35,464
take a rest, Odette.

302
00:27:52,914 --> 00:27:56,564
Isn't it amazing?  The cuteness of babies.

303
00:27:56,564 --> 00:27:59,434
They are better than humans.

304
00:28:01,874 --> 00:28:05,644
Ugh, this rascal. What are you going to do now?

305
00:28:07,704 --> 00:28:09,614
I'm sorry.

306
00:28:13,234 --> 00:28:14,774
But they're so cute.

307
00:28:14,774 --> 00:28:16,954
Just now, their eyes were filled with love.

308
00:28:16,954 --> 00:28:18,474
I told you not to meddle with life.

309
00:28:18,474 --> 00:28:20,774
You told me to look after widows and orphans.

310
00:28:20,774 --> 00:28:24,514
It's an angel's duty to love goodness and hate evil.

311
00:28:24,514 --> 00:28:28,894
I just followed my instincts.

312
00:28:28,894 --> 00:28:29,974
Oh, so that's what it was, huh?

313
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:31,784
So. So that's why

314
00:28:31,784 --> 00:28:35,104
you pushed a 17-year-old into a manhole.

315
00:28:35,104 --> 00:28:38,134
Pushed? I never touch humans.

316
00:28:38,134 --> 00:28:40,344
Besides, that kid bullied his friends in school.

317
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:42,364
  Do you have money in there? 

318
00:28:42,364 --> 00:28:43,414
That's it?

319
00:28:43,414 --> 00:28:45,514
You opened the cages on a truck full of dogs

320
00:28:45,514 --> 00:28:49,654
- and filled the streets with them.
 - They were about to be sold at a dog market.

321
00:28:49,654 --> 00:28:52,474
It's illegal and they were abused.

322
00:28:52,474 --> 00:28:56,614
Oh, goodness.  What will I do about this immature kid?

323
00:28:56,614 --> 00:29:00,624
God's great purpose won't be tampered with just because of a lowly angel like me flicking a finger.

324
00:29:00,624 --> 00:29:07,374
And... by tomorrow, I'll be up there anyway.

325
00:29:07,374 --> 00:29:11,554
My term is... done.

326
00:29:11,554 --> 00:29:13,364
You're so annoying.

327
00:29:17,084 --> 00:29:21,804
Senior Hoo, humans can't see us. Right?

328
00:29:21,804 --> 00:29:24,694
Even if they have excellent senses.

329
00:29:24,694 --> 00:29:25,664
 Who are you? 

330
00:29:25,664 --> 00:29:29,584
 Why did you sit on an occupied bench without asking? 

331
00:29:29,584 --> 00:29:33,234
Never mind. I just met a very sensitive human with a foul mouth.

332
00:29:33,234 --> 00:29:37,604
You. Did you perhaps...

333
00:29:37,604 --> 00:29:41,254
I didn't do anything. If anything, she was the one who did.

334
00:29:42,054 --> 00:29:47,934
If you lay a finger on a human, you will disappear at once...

335
00:29:47,934 --> 00:29:52,254
just like smoke.

336
00:29:52,254 --> 00:29:54,664
Like dust,

337
00:29:54,664 --> 00:29:57,704
you will disappear.

338
00:29:57,704 --> 00:30:00,794
I have 24 hours left.  Nothing will happen!

339
00:30:00,794 --> 00:30:03,764
I'm scared that you have a long 24 hours left.

340
00:30:03,764 --> 00:30:08,824
I feel like you will finally manage to do that hard angel's extinction.

341
00:30:08,824 --> 00:30:11,054
Yes, yes. I will be careful of falling leaves, too.

342
00:30:11,054 --> 00:30:13,804
I'm scared I'll meet a wild and violent human.

343
00:30:13,804 --> 00:30:16,234
 This darned sixth sense is heightened more than ever now. 

344
00:30:16,234 --> 00:30:18,954
 I don't need it. God? Of course, there is. 

345
00:30:18,954 --> 00:30:22,124
 But that God is a bastard. 

346
00:30:29,334 --> 00:30:31,724
Do you hear that?  It's midnight tomorrow.

347
00:30:31,724 --> 00:30:33,594
Don't be late.

348
00:30:36,254 --> 00:30:37,504
Yes, Sir.

349
00:30:37,504 --> 00:30:41,794
I'll make sure to return before the bell rings twelve times.
