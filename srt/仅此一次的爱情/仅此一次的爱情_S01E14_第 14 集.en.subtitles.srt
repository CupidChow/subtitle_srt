1
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,557
She should have died on that day too.

2
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,226
It was just postponed, that's all.

3
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:02,854
No matter how much you try
to escape from it,

4
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:05,106
a prophecy will come to pass.

5
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,609
One's destiny will be fulfilled.

6
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:11,654
Let's do it.

7
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:19,329
Marry

8
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:23,041
me,

9
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,084
Yeon-seo.

10
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,039
Should we do it tomorrow?

11
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,582
That soon?

12
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,960
We have no time. Ten days later...

13
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:13,258
Giselle will start soon.
I want to get married before then.

14
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,553
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

15
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:17,470
What?

16
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:20,056
You said no up until
when I had my rehearsal.

17
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,100
So why did you suddenly change your mind?

18
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,061
It's not sudden.
I've always wanted to do it.

19
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:28,815
I thought your mind changed
because you had turned into a human.

20
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,608
Hey, how could you say that--

21
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:31,901
I should've acted coyly.

22
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:33,027
I was too easy on you.

23
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,738
I proposed and I even bought the ring.

24
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,116
And I was rejected for days on end.

25
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:39,617
It hurts my pride.

26
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,037
It's not too late to take back your words.

27
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,875
-Are you serious?
-Yes. I'm not scared.

28
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,294
How could you say that?

29
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,635
If you take it back, I can propose to you.

30
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,221
I can do it hundreds of times.

31
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:01,472
I'll make it official.

32
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:04,601
What's with you?

33
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:07,312
Yeon-seo.

34
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,859
You're my first for everything.

35
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:15,695
When I was a human,

36
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:17,906
an angel,

37
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:19,741
and even now,

38
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:21,659
all I have is you.

39
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,538
I wanted to live because of you.

40
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,333
I wanted to become a human so badly

41
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,710
because of you.

42
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,175
I'm a fool who's hesitant, makes you wait,

43
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,387
and even makes you cry.
If you're okay with that,

44
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,141
then will you marry me?

45
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:48,478
I hate you.

46
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,105
You said everything that I wanted to say.

47
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,614
I'll make you happy.

48
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,200
I promise.

49
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:07,747
Let's live together
for thousands of years.

50
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,974
Her fate was to be killed by the wicked.

51
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,559
Some people are born that way.

52
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,312
It was just postponed, that's all.

53
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,148
No matter how much you try
to escape from it,

54
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,235
a prophecy will come to pass.

55
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,115
One's destiny will be fulfilled.

56
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,587
REPORT

57
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,511
I thought this was destiny.

58
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,307
I believed I met her,

59
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,809
thought of her,

60
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,228
and loved her

61
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,649
because those were what
You wanted me to do.

62
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,776
I'm not scared

63
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:20,945
of vanishing

64
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:24,657
or dying.

65
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,577
However, I'm most afraid

66
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,706
of Yeon-seo being in pain

67
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:33,791
because of me.

68
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:35,752
But

69
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,588
this isn't right.

70
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:42,133
It's her destiny to die?

71
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,802
No, I cannot

72
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,263
accept that.

73
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,600
Even if it's a prophecy that'll come true,

74
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,977
I'll change it.
I won't let You have Your way.

75
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,522
I'll do it my way.

76
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,090
Are you sleeping?

77
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:23,716
No.

78
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,176
I'm coming in.

79
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:32,683
Did you go somewhere?

80
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,644
I forgot

81
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:36,687
to say something.

82
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:40,149
What is it?

83
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,076
Yeon-seo.

84
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,081
I...

85
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,543
What are you trying to say
with such a serious face?

86
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:06,801
I haven't become a human yet.

87
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:10,388
And I don't think I can.

88
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,978
I thought it was possible.

89
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,440
I thought the deity
had answered my prayer.

90
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,318
But I was wrong.

91
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:28,030
I thought the deity had allowed me
to become happy with you.

92
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:32,910
But I was wrong.

93
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:43,671
So what?

94
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:47,717
I don't care
if you're an angel or a human.

95
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,763
You might witness

96
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,308
such incidents again.

97
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,647
Then I can hold onto you again.

98
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,191
Do you remember what you said?

99
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,611
You said you'd propose to me
hundreds of times even if I took it back.

100
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:10,198
I feel the same way. You see.

101
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,534
I can hold onto you hundreds of times.

102
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,039
I won't ever give up.

103
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,209
I might disappear

104
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:23,794
right in front of your eyes.

105
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,424
Aren't you afraid of that?

106
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,259
I'm afraid

107
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,473
that I won't be there when it happens.

108
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,435
I'm scared

109
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,397
that you'll die all alone once again.

110
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:47,902
I won't

111
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,363
let you be alone.

112
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,658
So Dan.

113
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,203
Let's stay together.

114
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,121
Okay?

115
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,670
Let's only cry until today.

116
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,296
From tomorrow on,

117
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:10,550
let's smile

118
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:12,969
as if a day will last forever.

119
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,012
Deal?

120
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,620
What is it?

121
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,665
Why did you tell me to sit down?

122
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:47,712
Ms. Jung, I wish to marry Ms. Lee.

123
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,839
Please allow me to marry her.

124
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,092
-What are you doing?
-I know I am not good enough,

125
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,510
but if you give me your permission,

126
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,929
I can promise you
that I'll make her happy forever.

127
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,765
I don't know where he saw this from,

128
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,767
but he really wanted to try it.

129
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,477
Please just play along with it.

130
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:06,397
Well, I need to know how far
this role-playing is going

131
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,024
for me to play along with it.

132
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,486
Are you two seriously wanting
to get married?

133
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,534
How did your relationship develop this far
in a blink of an eye?

134
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,785
Please give me your blessing.

135
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,454
Well...

136
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,581
My gosh.

137
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,834
Who am I to give you my blessing?

138
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:29,795
I really want the blessing, and
you're the only one left in this family.

139
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,548
Please play along with it.

140
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:35,926
Goodness.

141
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,518
In your dreams.

142
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:48,439
I raised her since she was a baby

143
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:51,400
with all that I could give.

144
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,069
Her looks? Her intelligence?
Her character...

145
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,320
Okay, not that.

146
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,655
Anyway, she's a precious lady.

147
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,284
All you've got is that handsome face.
How dare you covet her?

148
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,080
What can you offer to her? Anything?

149
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:05,539
How could you let this happen?

150
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,459
How dare you love your boss?
You must've forgotten your place!

151
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,796
Never! You can marry her
over my dead body--

152
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:12,838
Ms. Jung!

153
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:15,508
How could you be so harsh?

154
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,469
There's nothing wrong with Dan.

155
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,262
There's no one like him in this world.

156
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,391
It's not like we're living
in the Middle Ages.

157
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,226
How could you say
such brutal things to him?

158
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,436
I'm truly disappointed in you.

159
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:29,939
Wait, you said to play along--

160
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,315
I don't care what anyone says.

161
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,859
I'll marry Dan
even if the universe is against it.

162
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:37,446
The wedding will be in the garden
a week from now.

163
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,782
So plan my wedding accordingly.

164
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:41,951
Hey, wait.

165
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,581
I'm sorry, Ms. Jung.
It's all because of me.

166
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:50,334
What am I supposed to do then?

167
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:18,487
You're very good at acting.

168
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,116
I was in the drama club at my school.

169
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,955
I'm sorry. I got carried away.

170
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,545
He won't leave now?

171
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,633
Ms. Lee, I like Dan.

172
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,888
He's cute, handsome, and kind.

173
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:46,724
But to me, he's not important.

174
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:49,143
You are the most important person
to me, Ms. Lee.

175
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,270
I meant some of what I said.

176
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,024
Love? It's nice for now.

177
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:58,819
But you know, love changes
whenever it wants to.

178
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:02,281
I can't ever see you getting

179
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,575
abandoned again.

180
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,412
Don't be like that. That doesn't suit you.

181
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:11,207
We've been indifferent
toward one another until now.

182
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,503
Of course.

183
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:18,130
Our indifferent
relationship will last a long time.

184
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,673
A very long time.

185
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:26,722
Don't worry.

186
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:28,599
I can be alone again.

187
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:32,478
The happiness I feel now
will be enough for me to live my life.

188
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,444
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

189
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:47,159
And yet, I gave my all
to make you acknowledge me.

190
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:49,453
I regret it.

191
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,303
But you must still dance.

192
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,765
When your mother kicked me out
without giving me anything,

193
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,601
I knew that she would be
the cause of her collapse.

194
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,729
Ni-na, let me tell you about art.

195
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,398
Even when your house is burning down

196
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:20,025
or when your parents are dying,
art always continues.

197
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:29,702
You told me

198
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:32,746
to be her understudy
because you were planning to do this.

199
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,290
What else do you have left?

200
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,500
Ji Kang-woo? Your family?

201
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:39,336
You only have ballet left.

202
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:45,926
What is this?

203
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,224
Thank you for your lessons.

204
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,858
What are you doing?

205
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,068
I've learned a lot thanks to you.

206
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:07,156
However, I won't stoop so low
just like my family.

207
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,491
Even if I become Giselle
by harming Yeon-seo,

208
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,620
I wouldn't have earned it.

209
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,455
Let go of her hand.

210
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,377
So it was you.

211
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,713
I knew she had someone coaching her.

212
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,883
-Director Ji, how did you find me here?
-I asked Ui-geon.

213
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,260
I stopped by a few places
where you would be.

214
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,388
Don't mind her.

215
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,058
What is it that you want to gain

216
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,393
by spying on me
and driving Ni-na into a corner?

217
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,312
What are you doing to Ni-na?

218
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:41,231
I've done her a favor unlike you.

219
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,025
I helped her break out of her shell.

220
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,861
If her dance ruins herself,
it'll crumble away eventually.

221
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:50,157
But that's the Giselle you wanted.

222
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,534
Both of you, stop!

223
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:55,120
It's all over. This is all pointless.

224
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,467
Here.

225
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:09,802
Don't resign.

226
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,346
How could I ever dance again?

227
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,682
You can't imagine how many times
a day I think about dying.

228
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:15,808
I feel like I'm responsible

229
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:18,018
and this will be resolved
if I'm gone. It's driving me crazy.

230
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,980
What's the point of dancing
when this is how I feel?

231
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:22,898
Give me a chance.

232
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:25,275
A chance to use you, Ni-na.

233
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:29,363
I'll put on an excellent version
of Giselle no matter what.

234
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:31,699
For

235
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:33,951
Yeon-seo?

236
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:36,537
For Yeon-seo.

237
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,916
For you. For the corps.

238
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,584
And for me.

239
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,254
That has been my goal.

240
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:48,632
Liar.

241
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:52,886
Your goal was getting Yeon-seo.

242
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:58,684
Goodbye.

243
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,493
IT WAS THE BALLERINA'S FAMILY
THAT TRIED TO TAKE HER LIFE

244
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,414
THE DEPRAVED ACT REVEALED
ON THEIR 20TH ANNIVERSARY

245
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:23,000
They will interrogate Chairman Keum
and General Director Choi.

246
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,044
And they haven't subpoenaed
Associate Director Keum yet.

247
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,129
Why haven't they arrested her yet?

248
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,882
I went to the police and said it was
Associate Director Keum's doing.

249
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:30,966
Ki Jun-su.

250
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,093
He's the connection,
but they haven't found him yet.

251
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,012
It's because they can't prove it.

252
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,017
Are you all ready?

253
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:42,603
Yes.

254
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,648
Should we get going?

255
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,150
I don't know what to do.

256
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,028
I'm so nervous.

257
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,037
Which one do you like?

258
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,246
-This one.
-This one.

259
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:03,999
Which one would you like?

260
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,167
-That one.
-That one.

261
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,713
You can't even be on the same page
from the get-go.

262
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,007
I guess you two aren't a very good match.

263
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,592
No, that's not true.

264
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,427
We'll take both.

265
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:23,769
This one.

266
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,437
And that one.

267
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:28,941
And this too.

268
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:31,902
This--

269
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,529
Let's skip this one.

270
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,489
Why? It's nice.

271
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,282
You didn't even think about it
before buying.

272
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,034
Do you know how much money
you spent just today?

273
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,035
I wanted to buy good ones

274
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,829
because we'll use them
for the rest of our lives.

275
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:45,707
All I need is you.

276
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:47,334
Let's just use the ones we have at home.

277
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:48,961
-Please?
-The honeymoon phase won't last.

278
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,005
If you're like this now,
it's not going to work out.

279
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,591
What did you say?

280
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,469
We'll take this one.

281
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:58,846
Let's go.

282
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,557
You should watch what you say!

283
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,724
Let's go this way.

284
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:09,982
I like this one.

285
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,401
What about you?

286
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:14,945
I like everything.

287
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,030
You should pick what you like too.

288
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:19,032
We're going to share it.

289
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,536
Just pick the one you like.
I'm fine with anything.

290
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,496
Come on, take a look.

291
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:25,747
I'm fine.

292
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,750
Usually, the grooms
think of shopping as a hassle.

293
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,087
They say they're good with anything
and want to get it over with.

294
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,299
Is that what it is?

295
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:36,884
No!

296
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,468
And people break off engagements.

297
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,804
You can't get married
if you don't see eye to eye now.

298
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,269
Wait...

299
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:52,816
Stop playing house.
This is taking a toll on me, punk.

300
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:59,031
Yeon-seo, keep looking.
Let me just use the restroom.

301
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,800
How petty.
How can an angel try to create a rift?

302
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,428
Well, an angel I know
is trying to marry a human.

303
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:22,554
What I did wasn't so bad.

304
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:25,349
Leave before Yeon-seo comes out.
I won't change my mind.

305
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,100
Please. Dan!

306
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,603
Don't try to jump into the fiery pit.

307
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:33,649
You give me no choice.

308
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:36,985
Since the angel won't come to his senses,
I must persuade the human.

309
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:38,904
Don't do it.

310
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,772
I'm not asking for much.
Just leave me alone!

311
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:16,233
I cannot let you dissipate.

312
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,985
I don't want that to happen.

313
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,278
I told you already.

314
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:24,157
That human will die soon.
Why can't you just give up?

315
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:29,997
Why do you waste your time with a human
who will be gone soon, Dan?

316
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,541
If there is no end,

317
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,377
then does it mean I'm not wasting my time?

318
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,629
It's the opposite, Hu.

319
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,715
You have no idea
how every single day shines

320
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,509
because there is an end.

321
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:45,637
We wish to promise to be forever
because it cannot last forever.

322
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:47,472
Do you understand?

323
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:51,852
What's going on?

324
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,282
Hey.

325
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,243
Why do you address me like that?

326
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,370
You're Dan's senior, not mine.

327
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:14,249
If you're his senior, you should
support him like a good senior.

328
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,252
Do not hit him.

329
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:18,754
I will not let it pass.

330
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,006
I didn't hit him.

331
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,676
I started the fight.

332
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,096
He can send me to Africa
with a flick of his finger,

333
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:29,931
but he dealt with me.

334
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:32,976
I'm glad you know.

335
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:35,896
Ms. Lee.

336
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:43,195
Gosh, you surprised me.

337
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:45,739
All right.

338
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:51,328
-Ms. Lee, a marriage is--
-Do you want to officiate at our wedding?

339
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,539
What? Me?

340
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,583
That might put you in a tight spot.

341
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,877
Then why don't you come on that day
and give us your blessing?

342
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:00,545
Hey, Noisy Gong.

343
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:01,922
I'm not too thrilled about that.

344
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:03,924
What did the deity do for us?

345
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:05,717
What did the deity do for Dan?

346
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:09,221
-Yeon-seo.
-But you are

347
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:11,723
Dan's only family on this land.

348
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:20,357
I

349
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:22,692
ask of you.

350
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:29,699
That wedding will not happen.

351
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:34,246
You will not receive anyone's blessing.

352
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:37,499
-Hu.
-I'm done with this.

353
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:40,085
You can try to live with this idiot
who absolutely never listens.

354
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,300
Don't mind what he said.

355
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,218
I don't need anyone's blessing.

356
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:32,971
All I need is you.

357
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:36,558
But there is something
that's bothering me.

358
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:40,312
-What is it?
-That you absolutely never listen.

359
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,026
I wanted to have a laugh.
We said we'll do that.

360
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:56,703
Look.

361
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:57,954
What's this?

362
00:24:58,371 --> 00:24:59,581
Our wedding invitation.

363
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,918
We don't have anyone to give it to,

364
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,794
but I wanted to make one
to keep it between us.

365
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:08,632
Be honest.

366
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:10,634
You've dated before, haven't you?

367
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:14,512
Does this mean I'm good?

368
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:19,601
Let me see.

369
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:26,233
You two can't evade your charges.

370
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:27,567
Give it a good thought.

371
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:37,369
Don't do that.

372
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:40,247
It's not like you did this.
Why do you want to take the blame?

373
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,831
You didn't do this either.

374
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:43,333
It's my crime.

375
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,502
It's my crime to just watch.

376
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:48,713
I was at ease thinking,
"This is probably okay."

377
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:51,883
Even now, we're trying to save our kid...

378
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:00,392
I need to be punished for the crime.

379
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:01,893
I will be punished!

380
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,146
If you wait for me,

381
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,732
I'll plant onions once I'm released.

382
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:11,403
I can plant green onions,
watercress, carrots, whatever.

383
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:14,698
I will plant and raise them.
So honey, I'll...

384
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:17,701
It's too late.

385
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,327
We cannot live

386
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:22,706
with our hearts at ease
for the rest of our lives.

387
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:02,954
Why are you hiding in the office
at night like a stray cat?

388
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:10,253
This is good.
I had a question for you anyway.

389
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:12,255
Take a seat.

390
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,840
You need to stop here.

391
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:15,884
This is your last chance.

392
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:17,677
What did I do?

393
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,179
You would know

394
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,723
your crime the best.

395
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:26,603
Do you have supernatural powers
of some sort?

396
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,898
I thought it was weird

397
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:34,235
how a girl who fell off
a tall building was completely fine,

398
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:39,074
and how someone was hanging
on the roof all of a sudden.

399
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,243
It's not something
that a normal person can do.

400
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,956
Tell me.

401
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,000
I like this sort of thing.

402
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:50,627
It's fun.

403
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:53,463
A person's life is at stake,

404
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:55,965
and it's just fun for you?

405
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:57,258
Because

406
00:27:58,259 --> 00:27:59,928
I love someone who is strong

407
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,180
and competent.

408
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:06,976
It'll be great to do
something fun together.

409
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,610
You are utterly rotten to your roots.

410
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,824
No matter what your evil plan is,
it won't come to pass.

411
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,034
If you cause a car accident,
I'll save her.

412
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,203
If you drop her off of a building,
I'll catch her.

413
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:29,165
So quit your useless plans and stop here.

414
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,296
Good and evil

415
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:39,134
aren't so black and white.

416
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:43,012
But winning and losing can be determined.

417
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,683
You'll end up losing.

418
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:48,893
Do you know why?

419
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:53,648
Because I would have killed me
if I were you.

420
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,611
The good side is always slow.

421
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:01,531
That's why they lose.

422
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:04,534
You're a human too.

423
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,246
A human can make mistakes, regret them,

424
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:10,707
and then ask for forgiveness.

425
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,001
I was hoping you would understand.

426
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,007
Please stop here.

427
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,886
If you do anything rash, I might end up

428
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:27,891
killing you.

429
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:44,240
All of them are canceled?

430
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,201
-Yes, they're calling to cancel.
-Okay.

431
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:47,368
Can you reconsider?

432
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,245
-Hey, how many tickets?
-I'm not sure.

433
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,705
How many people refunded their tickets?

434
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,957
I'm checking once again in the system.

435
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,293
We've never had to refund so many
tickets a week before the show.

436
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,170
We're trying to find a countermeasure too.

437
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:01,424
Can you call the reporters? Right now.

438
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:05,720
Do you really have nothing to say
about this incident?

439
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,139
I'll do an exclusive interview
with you once everything is settled.

440
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,224
Please do understand.

441
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,935
There was a violent act,
and now people want refunds.

442
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:13,937
How will you overcome this crisis?

443
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,897
I believe this is an opportunity,
not a crisis.

444
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:19,108
It's a chance to watch
Lee Yeon-seo's Giselle.

445
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:22,570
Can you call it Fantasia's Giselle,
not Lee Yeon-seo's?

446
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:26,282
Every single one of our dancers
is an excellent artist.

447
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,784
Everyone is important.

448
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:30,370
There are many rumors and scandals
surrounding our ballet theater.

449
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:33,373
We will show you an excellent performance
to quiet down all of that.

450
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:36,417
But there is no use
if the seats are empty.

451
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,711
We plan on inviting special guests.

452
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:41,339
We will invite people who have
never seen a ballet performance.

453
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:44,425
We'd like to show them
how beautiful ballet is.

454
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,016
It was a great idea.

455
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,434
Both having an interview

456
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,437
and offering to show those people
ballet for the first time.

457
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,357
Why are you avoiding me?

458
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:01,943
You don't pick up my calls.

459
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:04,279
Why do you avoid me after dropping a bomb?

460
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,363
Because that was

461
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:07,615
all I could do.

462
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:18,793
What's this?

463
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:20,336
We're getting married.

464
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:29,637
WE WISH TO BE EACH OTHER'S GUARDIAN
ANGELS AND PROMISE ETERNAL LOVE

465
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,681
Do you have to invite him?

466
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,182
I don't like that guy.

467
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,937
I thought it could be an answer.

468
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:42,150
We are going to live happily.

469
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:43,985
Every single day.

470
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,738
That's my answer to your bomb.

471
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:50,825
Yeon-seo, you are

472
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:54,037
completely insane. You're getting married?

473
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:55,788
Kim Dan will disappear soon.

474
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:56,748
It'll be over.

475
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:58,875
Do you think

476
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,877
I told you that out of excitement?

477
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:04,547
I knew you would be shocked and hurt,
but I had no choice.

478
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:06,341
I wanted to protect you.

479
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,386
That's funny.

480
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,473
You told me that to stop me,

481
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:17,894
but I wanted to marry him
after I heard what you said.

482
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:20,396
I see.

483
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,982
I'm sure you two
are more passionate than ever

484
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,109
as if you are Romeo and Juliet.

485
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:26,486
But you know what?

486
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,489
That story happened over five days.

487
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,908
It's only momentary. It will pass.

488
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:34,285
Do not invest so much into this.

489
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:38,039
Right, five days.

490
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,877
Some people can live their whole life
with just those five days.

491
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:47,256
Don't you know what that feels like?

492
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,302
Let me ask you one last time.

493
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:54,222
Is there really no way

494
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:58,142
for Dan to become a human?

495
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,604
Tell me anything.

496
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:03,731
I wish there was something
that I could do.

497
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,733
I will do anything gladly

498
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:07,860
to let him live longer--

499
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:08,820
Enough.

500
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:10,655
Stop it.

501
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,782
That's exactly why Seol-hui died.

502
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,535
Do not bet anything
and do not throw away anything.

503
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:19,038
If you do not exist in this world,
do you think he would want to live?

504
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,082
That's not a reward. It's a punishment.

505
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:35,471
I have to go.

506
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:39,934
Yeon-seo.

507
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,606
Her name was Seol-hui, right?

508
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:48,401
I'm sure

509
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,112
she's heartbroken even in her afterlife.

510
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,491
The person she risked her life to save

511
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:02,248
thinks living is a punishment
and that it's tormenting.

512
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:08,921
I...

513
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:11,591
We won't be like that.

514
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,010
I'll make sure that doesn't happen.

515
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:32,361
No. That's all made up. It's a lie.

516
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:35,239
If I do that on a sunny day,
this body will be destroyed.

517
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,325
You can always be regenerated.

518
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:38,576
Let's give it a try.

519
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:39,577
That's not it.

520
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,746
Then what is it? Do you know the way?

521
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,376
Do you have to die?

522
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:49,045
Is that the only way?

523
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,338
Of course.

524
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:52,757
Act Two will only begin
after Giselle dies.

525
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:54,675
That's the only way for her
to save Albrecht.

526
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,595
No. I'm sure he didn't wish for that.

527
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:01,432
Don't become too immersed in it.
It's not like I'm actually dying.

528
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:02,517
My gosh.

529
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,403
Now you just barge in like this?

530
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:16,614
Our boundary has completely fallen.

531
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:17,782
Completely.

532
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:21,369
What can I do? What can I do to save Dan?

533
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:24,539
If I give up dancing,
my eyes, or even my life,

534
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:27,500
can he live?

535
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,669
Tell me. If that's true,

536
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:32,880
I think I might
really be thankful for the deity.

537
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,637
People usually wish to live.

538
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,639
They do not risk their lives so easily.

539
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,851
How do you know how I feel
when I'm not even sure?

540
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,352
I'll do anything.

541
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:47,603
I'll give up everything!

542
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:48,688
You said

543
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:50,690
you wanted to live on that day.

544
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,111
Please help us. Please.

545
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,990
I want to live.

546
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,909
I wanted to die every single day,

547
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:04,328
but I want to live now.

548
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:09,584
It's a sin for him to save a woman
who begged for her life.

549
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:11,711
It's only right that the angel

550
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:14,714
should be dissipated
as punishment for that sin.

551
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,552
He has to die

552
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,388
because he saved me?

553
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:23,764
I wanted to save him too.

554
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,976
I wanted to send him back up to paradise.

555
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,397
But we cannot change an ending
that is already decided.

556
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:41,115
No, I will change it.

557
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:43,868
I will

558
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:45,995
save Dan.

559
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,206
Wait and see.

560
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,846
Why were you waiting?

561
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:05,932
Let's go.

562
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:07,892
Ni-na is waiting for us at home.

563
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,477
She came back?

564
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:19,570
I'm sorry for everything, Ni-na.

565
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,365
So just forgive me and--

566
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:23,616
It's my fault.

567
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:25,493
I was a coward.

568
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,329
I realized that
I've been acting like an angel,

569
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,332
hiding behind you guys and Ru-na.

570
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:32,833
It was all my fault.

571
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:36,128
Then will you come home?

572
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:37,838
No, Ru-na.

573
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:39,840
I am going to live by myself.

574
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:43,052
As of today, I do not have any family.

575
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,055
I called you here to tell you that.

576
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:52,144
Goodbye.

577
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,901
Ru-na, what's with you?

578
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,488
What's wrong with you?

579
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:04,949
Stop adding fuel to the fire,
and stay still.

580
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:09,036
You're going to cut us off
for you to feel at ease?

581
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,956
Why are you suddenly acting like this?

582
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,668
What did I mean

583
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:17,503
to you?

584
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:21,799
I love you.

585
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:24,593
I loved you in my own way.

586
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:26,512
And the way you love is wrong.

587
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:28,806
I don't want your love anymore.

588
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:30,433
-Keum Ni-na.
-Ru-na.

589
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:33,185
I liked you a lot.

590
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:34,729
You were always on my side.

591
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,230
You were so cool and dependable.

592
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,608
Do not say hi to me
even if we run into each other outside.

593
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:52,705
I will not let this slide.

594
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,385
-Look.
-What's this?

595
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,471
We have to write our wedding vows,

596
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:09,638
so I prepared these.

597
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:10,723
Right now?

598
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:11,682
Yes.

599
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:13,309
Here.

600
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,312
Take a pen.

601
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:19,690
WEDDING VOW

602
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:21,525
Right here.

603
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,235
You can write on my back.

604
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,655
Stay still.

605
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:46,801
WEDDING VOW
I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU

606
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,612
Just so you know,

607
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:10,449
I want to postpone having a kid
because I have to do ballet.

608
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:14,662
That's not good.

609
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:18,416
If we want ten kids, we need to get busy.

610
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:21,669
Dream on.

611
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,923
I'm going to have a daughter
who looks like you

612
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:28,300
and a son who looks like me.

613
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:38,144
But what if our son has your personality?

614
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,354
For his future...

615
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:42,314
Hey.

616
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,608
Why do you always hit me?

617
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,068
What's so wrong about my personality?

618
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:48,112
Think about it. I'm right.

619
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:49,738
If our son has your personality...

620
00:40:58,998 --> 00:40:59,832
Mom.

621
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:01,417
Dad.

622
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,836
THE LATE LEE JIN-UNG,
NA HUI-SU, CHO SEUNG-HWAN

623
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:04,962
Mr. Cho.

624
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:09,341
Say hi.

625
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:11,886
This is my fiancé.

626
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,767
Hello, I'm Kim Dan.

627
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:21,061
It's nice to meet you all.

628
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:27,318
Thank you for sending him to me.

629
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:30,863
When we meet up there,

630
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,574
I'll introduce him to you again.

631
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:36,368
When I first came here,

632
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:38,662
I told her

633
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:42,166
that I existed just for her

634
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:45,377
and that she was my goal in life.

635
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:49,048
I'll make sure I keep my words.

636
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:52,218
I may not be a human,

637
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:54,553
but I'll do my best

638
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:58,807
to make a single day of hers
feel like 1,000 years.

639
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:04,813
I'm sorry.

640
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:08,776
Why?

641
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:11,153
I want to stay by her side
for a very long time,

642
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:12,905
but I know I can't.

643
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:15,115
I'm sorry.

644
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:17,493
But

645
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,371
even after I'm gone,

646
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:22,373
please

647
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,626
take care of her so that she'll remain

648
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:28,921
as a strong and happy Noisy Gong.

649
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:43,769
Yeon-seo.

650
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:45,062
We're getting a divorce.

651
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:46,605
We haven't gotten married yet.

652
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:47,940
We promised not to say that.

653
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:51,610
We promised to live forever
and have ten kids.

654
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:53,404
We promised.

655
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:56,949
Yeon-seo.

656
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:58,659
Listen to me.

657
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:03,539
I'll probably disappear like dust.

658
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:07,334
I'll probably vanish

659
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:10,212
into thin air.

660
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:14,925
No, don't say that. It won't happen.

661
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:16,552
Even when I'm gone,

662
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:19,680
you need to stay strong and beautiful.

663
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:21,974
Okay?

664
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,102
Can you promise me?

665
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:35,321
Please, Yeon-seo.

666
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:39,074
If you're going to become
completely broken after I'm gone,

667
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:42,786
I won't be able to marry you. Okay?

668
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:46,206
Then you should make the same promise.

669
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:49,793
Who knows?

670
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:52,755
You could vanish
or I could die before you do.

671
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:55,007
No one knows what will happen.

672
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:00,262
That will never happen to you.

673
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,057
Good. Then promise me.

674
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,684
Let's promise
that whoever gets left behind

675
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:07,144
will live

676
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:09,313
a good, happy life.

677
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:14,234
Do it.

678
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:42,388
Why did you all of a sudden...

679
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:46,600
Thank you for your hard work.
Keep up the good effort.

680
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:42,823
So what do they want?

681
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:44,700
They didn't say.

682
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,953
They've been just handing him money
every single time he meets them.

683
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:50,706
-Then we should report this.
-We have no solid proof.

684
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,917
For now, please keep meeting her.

685
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:55,669
Can I do that?

686
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:57,504
And please

687
00:45:58,464 --> 00:45:59,798
report back to him.

688
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:03,594
You may go now. Be careful.

689
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:05,471
Okay.

690
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,102
Why are you so confident?

691
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:14,313
What if he tells Ru-na about us?

692
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:16,899
I hope he does. Only then, she'll stop.

693
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:18,609
She will never change.

694
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:21,111
She'll either make another person do it
or change her method.

695
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:22,946
I know.

696
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:24,448
That's why

697
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:26,325
he's in your hands.

698
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:29,161
As for Ru-na,

699
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:31,205
I'll take care of her.

700
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:36,627
What do you mean by that?

701
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:43,258
-Don't worry about it.
-It can't be. No, right?

702
00:46:44,801 --> 00:46:46,720
Angels must not intervene in human life.

703
00:46:46,803 --> 00:46:48,222
And they shouldn't fall in love either.

704
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:51,308
I'm already a degenerate angel.

705
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:52,601
I'm not afraid.

706
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:55,687
Remember when you said

707
00:46:56,772 --> 00:47:00,150
that you could kill anyone for Yeon-seo?

708
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:05,113
You shouldn't do that.

709
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:06,532
Live on.

710
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:08,325
Do that

711
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:11,870
and stay by her side.

712
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:13,747
What are you trying to say?

713
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:15,541
Ballet.

714
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:20,212
Do that with her.

715
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,215
Make her shine

716
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:25,968
as brightly as possible.

717
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:30,472
Please.

718
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:41,483
People usually wish to live.

719
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,318
They do not risk their lives so easily.

720
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:55,455
Hi.

721
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:57,916
Warm up first.

722
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:00,544
I handed in my letter of resignation.

723
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:03,422
I refuse to be shameless
and continue doing ballet.

724
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:06,008
Did you even hear what I told you?

725
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,847
Punish yourself by seeing me every day.

726
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:15,976
-Why are you doing this?
-You need to practice.

727
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:18,562
If you don't, who will be Giselle?

728
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:21,523
Hey.

729
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:23,567
Did something happen?

730
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:25,861
I'm taking precautions.

731
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:27,613
Don't you know what an understudy is?

732
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:29,448
I need you to be on standby prepared

733
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:31,158
so that I can go on stage carefree.

734
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:36,622
I want it

735
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:39,875
to be you.

736
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:43,879
Go change.

737
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:16,513
Did you drink?

738
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:20,142
I'm sorry for making you come home alone.

739
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:26,398
I'm more sorry for practicing
even on the night before the wedding.

740
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:28,275
Are you all done?

741
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:32,529
I really wanted

742
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,490
to see your show.

743
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:38,577
I really wanted to see you

744
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:41,455
dance on the stage.

745
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:46,918
You can.

746
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:49,629
Okay.

747
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:52,299
I can do that.

748
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:07,939
That's good.

749
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:09,900
Move it to this side just a bit.

750
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:11,151
Yes, that's great.

751
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:14,029
Hey, you!
You need to level it with this side.

752
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:15,530
This way. Good.

753
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:16,740
No, turn it around.

754
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:19,493
Yes, put it there. Good.

755
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:20,786
Hold on.

756
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:22,162
Turn it around.

757
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:23,705
Just like this. Turn it around.

758
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:26,416
Yes. That's good. Good.

759
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:34,466
No, I'm not nervous.

760
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:40,514
Is it that obvious?

761
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:43,225
Come on.

762
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:47,354
Gureum.

763
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:50,273
You must live a long life.

764
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:54,903
Take good care of Yeon-seo for me.

765
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:01,701
Hey.

766
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:05,413
We didn't order a cake.

767
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:08,375
Hold on a second. It says

768
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:10,752
Archangel Hu sent this.

769
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:17,676
Surprise.

770
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:36,403
I know that you're working hard, Hu.

771
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:38,154
But you should play hooky just today.

772
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:39,573
It's a nice day.

773
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:44,786
Look.

774
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:47,414
The sky is clear. And it's sunny.

775
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:49,124
I can't give you my blessing.

776
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:54,504
I've already committed
several sins because of you.

777
00:52:55,171 --> 00:52:56,381
If I give you my blessing,

778
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:58,675
I think the deity will really punish me
with a thunderbolt.

779
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:07,601
My gosh, I don't know anymore.

780
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,645
I really can't understand

781
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:13,023
this foolish decision of yours.

782
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:15,191
But

783
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:19,487
give it a go.

784
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:21,698
Okay? Go as far as you can go.

785
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:29,789
I guess today will be the last day.

786
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:33,501
Thank you for coming.

787
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:37,047
Punk.

788
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:39,341
You look dashing.

789
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:40,967
Square your shoulders.

790
00:55:26,197 --> 00:55:29,534
Now, it's time for you
to recite your wedding vows.

791
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:41,921
Here's my marriage vow.

792
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:44,466
A day will be an eternity.

793
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:46,092
Two of us will become one.

794
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:48,845
I will love you with a happy heart.

795
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:51,598
We were each other's first

796
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,641
and will be each other's last.

797
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:57,395
We rescued one another

798
00:55:57,979 --> 00:55:59,022
and were rescued.

799
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:01,149
We believe in destiny.

800
00:56:01,983 --> 00:56:04,569
No, we don't believe in it.

801
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:09,199
-We believe in ourselves.
-We believe in ourselves.

802
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:27,717
MARRIAGE VOW

803
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:46,736
Gureum, look over there.

804
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:23,815
Are you going somewhere?

805
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:26,443
Are you awake?

806
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:32,407
You were looking at me even at dawn too.

807
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:35,702
Right back at you.

808
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:37,829
You were looking at me
when I was sleeping.

809
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:10,612
Bye.

810
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:14,532
Come back home safely.

811
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:19,496
Okay.

812
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:22,957
I'll be back.

813
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:32,902
Bye.

814
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:36,155
Dan.

815
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:55,466
Yes, call her right now.

816
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:56,801
Tell her to be there.

817
01:00:20,658 --> 01:00:22,160
Hello, I'm Lee Yeon-seo.

818
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:24,996
You know me, don't you?

819
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:27,040
Of course, you do.

820
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:30,543
You have to know me.
Think about everything you did to me.

821
01:00:31,919 --> 01:00:34,839
You made me an orphan at the age of 17,
made me blind so I couldn't dance,

822
01:00:35,673 --> 01:00:37,300
and you took away my one and only Mr. Cho.

823
01:00:39,552 --> 01:00:43,348
And all of my relatives
are dying to kill me.

824
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:46,934
Don't you think that's too much?

825
01:00:47,852 --> 01:00:48,853
But I didn't come

826
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:51,189
to complain about that.

827
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:54,400
I'm all right now
because you sent Dan to me.

828
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:56,986
I'm all right.

829
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:01,366
But you can't do that to Dan.

830
01:01:02,408 --> 01:01:05,119
I'm angry enough that he died
a horrible death as Seong-u.

831
01:01:05,703 --> 01:01:07,080
What did he do wrong?

832
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:08,748
His mission was to make me love.

833
01:01:09,248 --> 01:01:10,416
And I love Dan.

834
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,711
I don't know what kind of love
you wanted to see,

835
01:01:13,961 --> 01:01:16,923
but I am in love with Dan.

836
01:01:18,549 --> 01:01:19,384
But...

837
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:22,595
But why does he have to dissipate?

838
01:01:24,597 --> 01:01:26,641
If you have any conscience,
you cannot do this.

839
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:28,434
You can't do this!

840
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:54,377
You like fairness, don't you?

841
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:57,630
You take one thing

842
01:01:58,923 --> 01:02:00,007
and give another.

843
01:02:02,593 --> 01:02:03,553
Right?

844
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:37,670
I'm shocked.

845
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:39,213
You had a plan.

846
01:02:40,673 --> 01:02:41,716
I told you

847
01:02:42,216 --> 01:02:45,052
that I will stop you myself
if you try to do

848
01:02:46,053 --> 01:02:47,263
anything foolish again.

849
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:57,482
I am not curious about

850
01:02:58,357 --> 01:02:59,442
the providence

851
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:02,195
or the plan.

852
01:03:14,582 --> 01:03:16,250
If I must kill someone

853
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,629
for the sake of the one I wish to save,

854
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:23,049
then I will

855
01:03:25,426 --> 01:03:26,803
gladly commit that sin.

856
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:33,184
Take everything from me.

857
01:03:34,393 --> 01:03:35,394
Anything.

858
01:03:38,689 --> 01:03:40,274
I can give it to you gladly.

859
01:03:41,442 --> 01:03:42,443
-To...
-To...

860
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:44,737
-...save him.
-...save her.
