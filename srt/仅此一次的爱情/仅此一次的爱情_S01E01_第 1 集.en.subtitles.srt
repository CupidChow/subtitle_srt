1
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,043
No.

2
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:34,093
No, don't go.

3
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,137
Don't go.

4
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,663
No, come out of there.

5
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,706
Why are my dreams always in color?

6
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:45,874
It's so annoying.

7
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:32,670
Next.

8
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,716
Next.

9
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:38,593
Next.

10
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:45,600
One second.

11
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,437
What are you doing?

12
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,855
No one knows where this came from.

13
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:53,316
This step stool placed right by
the bathroom,

14
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:56,277
at the perfect place for me
to topple over.

15
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,738
No one knows why it's there.

16
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,823
They all need to experience

17
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,701
that someone who cannot see anything

18
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:06,120
may trip on that
and have their head crack open and die.

19
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:12,752
No one yet?

20
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,340
Was there a ghost here or something?

21
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,594
You're all fired.

22
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,560
It was me.

23
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:31,104
I know.

24
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,982
The step stool was covered with
a cheap lavender smell.

25
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,527
I used it yesterday when I cleaned up

26
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,904
old seasonal clothes
and forgot it was there.

27
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,406
I wasn't asking for the reason.

28
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:43,908
I do not care

29
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,202
about that.

30
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,833
Only the lavender girl is fired.

31
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,176
Good morning.

32
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,428
Hello, Ms. Jung.

33
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,306
Your staff members cause trouble

34
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,433
because you always come
and go right on time.

35
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,268
I'll give you the room of your choice,
so move in.

36
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,563
How can I deal with your temper
24 hours a day?

37
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:16,816
Mr. Cho can stick around
because he adores you,

38
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,110
-but I--
-You don't like me?

39
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:20,028
You know that already.

40
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,822
Here, take your mail for today.

41
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,119
Five.

42
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:34,000
The university, association, donation,

43
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,835
and a useless one as always.

44
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:38,755
FANTASIA CULTURAL FOUNDATION

45
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:44,093
This is the water bill.

46
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,222
Oh, that's just an advertisement.

47
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,557
You know, like a chain letter.

48
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,437
Korea became a great country.

49
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,397
They made an ad in braille.

50
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:05,448
"Invitation to Fantasia
Cultural Foundation's

51
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,826
20th Anniversary Party"?

52
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,627
Why is this already here?
Shouldn't it be next week?

53
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:23,966
Ms. Lee isn't going to attend anyway.
Ms. Choi is so persistent.

54
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:27,261
"Tuesday at 5 p.m."

55
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,016
Tomorrow?

56
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,352
Lee Gureum.

57
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,273
Let's go together.

58
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,817
I can go alone.

59
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,320
This is Cho Seung-hwan speaking.

60
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,115
Hello, doctor. The results are out?

61
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,619
This is Lee Yeon-seo.

62
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,371
You can talk to me.

63
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:55,498
I'm the one who'll receive
the cornea donation.

64
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,419
What's the problem this time?

65
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:04,340
Did the guardian refuse
at the last minute again?

66
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,510
Or did you spot an infection again?

67
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,596
What mistake is it this time?

68
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,474
Forget it.

69
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:15,768
Don't call me ever again.

70
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,770
I'll remove myself from the waiting list.

71
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,275
Doctor, please don't hang up. One minute.

72
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:25,695
Let her be!

73
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:29,699
You're not dressed to go out.

74
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,744
She'll feel better
after getting some fresh air.

75
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,329
I would have been upset too.

76
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,914
They've been doing this every single time.

77
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:38,916
I should visit the hospital.

78
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:43,671
You know what she went through.

79
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,757
After she went blind, she forbade
any of us from mentioning ballet.

80
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,260
She wanted nothing to do with Fantasia.

81
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:50,845
It's been three years already.

82
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,674
Goodbye, sky.

83
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,218
Goodbye, world.

84
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:33,721
Even though I'm not here,

85
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,015
you need to be

86
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,060
beautiful as always, okay?

87
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,355
80W 3964

88
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,774
COASTAL ROAD,
3964, TRUCK

89
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,779
You are a foolish man.

90
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:33,447
You steal animals.

91
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:34,907
You buy and sell lives.

92
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:37,285
You are living a miserable life.

93
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,415
This is so annoying.

94
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,292
What's wrong with this lighter?

95
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,296
What? What is this?

96
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,423
Is there a ghost? Is there? Gosh!

97
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,592
-I'm an angel, you punk.
-My goodness!

98
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,385
You should live a better life.

99
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,721
If you live a life that's uglier
than your face,

100
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:57,847
you'll be dead meat!

101
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:13,946
Where are you going?

102
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,073
Hey, come here! Hey!

103
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,327
Hey! Go in!

104
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,997
My client, are you ready?

105
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:25,791
Let's go.

106
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,759
Please give him peace.

107
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,481
I should go and receive
my final mission now.

108
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,114
COASTAL ROAD,
3964, TRUCK

109
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,538
Since it's my last day,
please assign me to an amazing one.

110
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,630
Gureum, wait.

111
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,136
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

112
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,765
Darn it. Watch where you're going.

113
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:26,769
Did you fall?

114
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,271
What? Are you blind?

115
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:33,192
Gosh. If you're blind,
you should have stayed home.

116
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:35,736
Why the hell are you outside jogging?

117
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,822
You're just a nuisance to others, okay?

118
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:40,866
You'll inconvenience those of us
who are normal.

119
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:42,827
-I'm sorry.
-You are, right?

120
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,663
-Let's hang out.
-Who are you?

121
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,706
I saw you jogging here a couple of times.

122
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,583
Why didn't you come with
that old man this time?

123
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,877
Some people would call this fate.

124
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,673
So let's hang out.

125
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,759
Have a sip. Drink it.

126
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,262
Those little...

127
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,099
You're about 175cm tall.

128
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,310
And you're shorter than him.

129
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,271
Are you even 170cm tall?

130
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:13,774
If you dare to touch me,

131
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,151
you'll get hurt.

132
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:18,028
Have you been working out? Goodness.

133
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,781
No wonder you have such
a nice look from behind.

134
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,825
I've warned you.

135
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,744
Are you going to do fencing with that?
You can't even see us.

136
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:26,787
Exactly.

137
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,706
What's the point in living
as a blind woman?

138
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,291
Your life is meaningless anyway.

139
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:31,625
You should do us a favor.

140
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,806
Be careful.
You can get hurt in a blink of an eye.

141
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,017
Do you think I saw this coming?

142
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,396
I'm not blind. I'm visually impaired.

143
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:55,608
Repeat after me.

144
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:57,359
Visually impaired.

145
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,905
"Blind" is a derogatory term for calling

146
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:02,907
someone who has lost their vision due to

147
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,617
either congenital or acquired reasons.

148
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:06,952
Do you even understand?

149
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,829
You're worth far less than Gureum.

150
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:12,666
Let's go.

151
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,001
You scamp!

152
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,914
The donor's final test results
don't look too good.

153
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,583
I'm afraid the donation won't be possible.

154
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:59,129
Gosh. If you're blind,
you should have stayed home.

155
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,590
Why the hell are you outside jogging?

156
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,300
What's the point in living
as a blind woman?

157
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,302
Your life is meaningless anyway.

158
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,942
Those dirtbags.

159
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,055
You've died

160
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,683
here once, haven't you?

161
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:54,643
It's dangerous!

162
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,186
My goodness! Oh, no!

163
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:57,855
It's dangerous!

164
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,191
-I said it's dangerous!
-What should we do?

165
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,110
What should we do?

166
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,906
My goodness, come down!

167
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,533
-Please come down!
-It's dangerous!

168
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,744
It's a piece of cake for me.

169
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,413
I've practiced it over 1,000 times.

170
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:15,831
I can do it with my eyes closed.

171
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,791
It's dangerous! Don't do it!

172
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,547
Gosh.

173
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,217
How is this possible?

174
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,308
Mom.

175
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,352
Dad.

176
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,896
I can't see a thing.

177
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:56,705
They say that a ballerina dies twice.

178
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,416
The first time is when we give up ballet.

179
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,378
The second time is when we stop breathing.

180
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,672
When I stopped being a dancer,

181
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,340
darkness was all around me.

182
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,551
Is there a point in waiting
for my second death?

183
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,805
I wished to rather face both deaths

184
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,264
at the same time.

185
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,471
You fool.

186
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,474
Humans die when they stop breathing.

187
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:06,418
Who's there?

188
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,173
Who are you?

189
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,385
Why did you sit on this bench
without asking me?

190
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,016
Are you looking down on me?

191
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,147
I was right. You're not answering me.

192
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,358
I know you're right there!

193
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:34,530
Just because I lost my sight
doesn't mean I know nothing.

194
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,615
The only sense I lost was my eyesight,

195
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,909
so I can still smell, hear,
and touch things.

196
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,160
Because I can't see anything,

197
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,121
my darned sixth sense is heightened
more than ever.

198
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,497
Wait, that's not it.

199
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:45,833
Did she hear me?

200
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,379
There's no way she heard me.

201
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,256
You were a guy?

202
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:55,968
What?

203
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,137
Can you hear me? You can?

204
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,347
I told you clearly
that my hearing is just fine.

205
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,058
How could this be possible?

206
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,351
I should be asking that.

207
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,353
How could this happen twice in one day?

208
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,940
What's your deal? Pickpocket? Pervert?

209
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:11,859
What is it that you're after?

210
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:15,404
I doubt that you sat next to a blind woman
just to watch the rain.

211
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:16,738
Wait.

212
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:17,823
Forget it.

213
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:19,950
I caught you, so just leave.

214
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,827
If you keep bothering me, you'll get hurt.

215
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:24,496
Wait

216
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:26,832
I don't want to!

217
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:28,876
What?

218
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:34,214
This bench does not belong to you or me.

219
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,633
The bench belongs to the deity.
No one else.

220
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,051
Am I wrong?

221
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,222
You're neither a pervert nor a pickpocket.

222
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:44,725
You're from some religious cult?

223
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:45,893
How dare you?

224
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:47,644
You have such a foul mouth.

225
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:48,812
Listen.

226
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,190
Whatever binds you here
will continue to bind you up above.

227
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,441
-And--
-I don't need that.

228
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,110
Be it Buddha, Jesus, or Allah.

229
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,445
I won't believe anyone.

230
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:01,116
Those who deny
the deity's existence will face--

231
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,451
I didn't say that.

232
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,244
A deity? Of course, there's a deity.

233
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,538
It's just that the deity is a jerk.

234
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,041
"A jerk"?

235
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:12,377
Those who blaspheme

236
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,046
-against the deity--
-He won't listen to me

237
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,255
no matter how hard I pray.

238
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,925
He ignores my wish when it's my only wish.

239
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,969
I asked Him to keep my dad
alive for one more day

240
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,513
to let me see my dad for
a week before he died.

241
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,099
I cried and prayed for
11 hours on the plane,

242
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,226
but He didn't listen.

243
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:28,685
I asked Him

244
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,854
to take one of my limbs
instead of my eyes.

245
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:32,689
That way, I could still be a dancer.

246
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,316
But he still ignored me.

247
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,445
That's what the deity,
your one and only, did to me.

248
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:41,573
Not everyone behaves like you

249
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,492
after experiencing a tragedy.

250
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:47,621
Not everyone jumps off
the bridge like you.

251
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,085
Who are you?

252
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,506
-She can grab me?
-You.

253
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:58,966
Who are you?

254
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,676
Who sent you?

255
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,678
Ms. Lee!

256
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:07,808
Ms. Jung!

257
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,226
Go get that guy.

258
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:11,520
A young man is running away, right?

259
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,105
Who? Who is it?

260
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:16,525
Over there! He's getting away!
Go get that man right now!

261
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,822
No one is here.

262
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:24,366
What...

263
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:25,909
He was right here.

264
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:27,536
Are you...

265
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:29,746
seeing ghosts now?

266
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,065
FANTASIA CULTURAL FOUNDATION'S
20TH ANNIVERSARY

267
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,567
That side is hung too high.

268
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,402
You came a day early.

269
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,739
Have you been well, Mr. Cho?

270
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:08,410
Tomorrow is Yeon-seo's parents'
death anniversary.

271
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:09,578
I'm aware of that.

272
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,706
-What's your point?
-Must it be tomorrow?

273
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:16,168
To be precise,
the 20th anniversary is next week.

274
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,212
Is Yeon-seo coming?

275
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,255
Ms. Choi.

276
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,174
She's been cooped up
at home for three years.

277
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:24,509
She never shows her face
at events held by the foundation.

278
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:25,802
It's very hard

279
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:29,014
to run a big organization like this
in place of her.

280
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,641
You have no idea.

281
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,437
I invited her, so she can come and see.

282
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,813
To see it for herself how well

283
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:39,024
I ran the organization
that she threw away.

284
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:40,609
My bad.

285
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,153
She won't be able to see it with her eyes.

286
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:45,822
My poor niece.

287
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,158
Yeon-seo won't be attending

288
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:49,409
the event tomorrow.

289
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,535
I invited her officially.

290
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,329
Let's make one thing clear.

291
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:53,622
We've fulfilled our duties.

292
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:54,790
Don't you just find this odd?

293
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,291
It's been three years, you know.

294
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:59,419
I was curious as to why she still
hasn't received a cornea donation.

295
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:00,879
She's always so close.

296
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:03,548
But it's always canceled
at the last minute.

297
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,760
Well, I guess the cells don't match.

298
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:09,179
What can I do? That's her luck.

299
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:10,097
Thanks to that,

300
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:13,433
you managed to keep your position
as the General Director. Right?

301
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:18,480
What's your point?

302
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:22,859
It's interesting that someone's misfortune
can bring luck to someone.

303
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,950
I plan to ask the police to investigate

304
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,244
regarding the canceled donation this time.

305
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,833
Don't make a fuss.

306
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,835
-The transplant list--
-Of course.

307
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,587
No one would try to hinder
the donation process.

308
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,714
If someone did,

309
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,800
I won't let that slide.

310
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:11,533
Tell me.

311
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,369
How much did he find out?

312
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:16,872
You can't go in. He's with a patient.

313
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:26,798
He already talked to the administration
and the donation center.

314
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,467
How am I supposed to

315
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:32,721
hide the truth?

316
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:37,976
So are you telling me that you told him

317
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,436
the truth?

318
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,730
Today, I pretended that
I didn't know anything.

319
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,940
-"Today"?
-I can't do this anymore.

320
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:45,567
I'm a doctor too.

321
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,819
I came here to tell you that.

322
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:53,283
Dr. Kim. I am aware that you are a doctor.

323
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:54,743
It's because you're a doctor,

324
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:57,287
I'm talking to you very politely

325
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,997
and treating you with respect.

326
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,668
I don't know anything, you know.

327
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,795
The doctor is the one who takes care of

328
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:09,090
the corneas, transplant,
and everything else.

329
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,176
If there's an investigation...

330
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:13,595
No.

331
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,305
That won't happen.

332
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:17,515
No, that can't happen.

333
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,351
Investigation?

334
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,603
Just keep this in mind.

335
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,396
Dr. Kim, you crossed a bridge.

336
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,775
And I destroyed that bridge.

337
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,362
You can't go back now.

338
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:31,988
Do you understand?

339
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:33,615
Yes.

340
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,515
Not everyone behaves like you

341
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:00,267
after experiencing a tragedy.

342
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:04,020
Who was that guy?

343
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:06,773
That was upsetting.

344
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:17,617
No shadow.

345
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,085
And I can't be seen.

346
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:30,046
So how did that woman know?

347
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,835
My dear client, are you alive?

348
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:14,966
What will happen to that cat?

349
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,386
I'm sorry, cat. I didn't see you there.

350
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:21,306
We reported it,
so they will take good care of it.

351
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:23,558
Stop crying and drink some tea.

352
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:25,101
If you cry, you'll run out of breath.

353
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:27,437
Ru-na, let's go back.

354
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:29,939
What if it gets hit again
before help comes?

355
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,107
Let's go back and bury it.

356
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,734
I want to do that. Please?

357
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:41,576
Ni-na. Get a hold of yourself
and stop crying.

358
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,538
It was just an accident.

359
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:47,290
You didn't kill it.

360
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:48,917
But still...

361
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,211
Something tragic just happened to it.

362
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:53,463
That's what tragedy is like for everyone.

363
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:56,299
It suddenly comes and takes everything.

364
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,552
You have to get rid of it
before it does that.

365
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,680
So pull yourself together
and stay grounded.

366
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,057
Tomorrow is your performance.

367
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:06,017
You can't let your heart
and body be shaken.

368
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:07,394
Ru-na.

369
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:10,605
So you should

370
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:14,317
drink this and sleep it off,

371
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,194
Odette.

372
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:28,039
Goodness.

373
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,001
Goodness.

374
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:34,754
Look at you.

375
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:37,424
Isn't it amazing? The cuteness of babies.

376
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:40,176
They are much better than humans.

377
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:46,391
You little rascal. What will you do now?

378
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:50,770
I'm sorry.

379
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:56,443
But they're adorable.

380
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,820
Your eyes were filled with love just now.

381
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,447
I told you to stop meddling with life.

382
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,115
You told me to look after
widows and orphans.

383
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:03,658
An angel's nature

384
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,326
is to love goodness and hate wickedness.

385
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,370
I just

386
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:09,873
followed my instinct.

387
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:12,792
I see. That's why you did this.

388
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:16,254
That's why you pushed a 17-year-old
boy into a shit hole.

389
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:19,716
"Pushed"? I never touch human beings.

390
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,260
And for your information,
he bullied his childhood friend.

391
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:23,803
You do have money. It's right here.

392
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,180
That's not all.

393
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:27,474
You opened the cages full of dogs
that was on the truck

394
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,267
and filled the streets with them.

395
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,603
They were about to be sold
at a dog market.

396
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,438
It's illegal, and they were abused.

397
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,190
Oh, goodness.

398
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,442
What will I do about this immature kid?

399
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,820
The deity's great purpose
won't be tampered

400
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:43,364
with just because a lowly angel
like me flicked a finger. And...

401
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,201
I will be

402
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,661
up there tomorrow anyway.

403
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,205
My term is...

404
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:54,584
-over.
-You're so annoying.

405
00:29:58,838 --> 00:29:59,881
Hey, Hu.

406
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,593
Humans can't see us, can they?

407
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,845
No matter how spiritual they are.

408
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:07,555
Who are you?

409
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,641
Why did you sit on this
bench without asking me?

410
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:13,186
Never mind. I met a sensitive human

411
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:14,979
who has a very foul mouth today.

412
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,105
You.

413
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:17,857
Wait, did you...

414
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:20,735
I didn't do anything.

415
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,153
If anything, she did something to me.

416
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:25,907
If you lay a finger on a human,

417
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:28,743
you will disappear immediately.

418
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:32,914
You will disappear like smoke

419
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,208
and dust,

420
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:37,669
at once.

421
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,880
I only have 24 hours left.

422
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:41,965
Nothing will happen.

423
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:45,677
I'm anxious because you have
24 hours left.

424
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,720
I feel like you are capable of

425
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:50,598
disappearing. You know how hard that is?

426
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,892
Yes, I will even
be careful of the falling leaves.

427
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,395
I'm scared I'll meet
a wild and violent human.

428
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,022
My darned sixth sense is heightened
more than ever.

429
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:58,982
I don't need that.

430
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,567
A deity? Of course, there's a deity.

431
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,735
It's just that the deity is a jerk.

432
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,204
Do you hear that? It's midnight tomorrow.

433
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:14,372
Don't be late.

434
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:21,045
I will make sure I return

435
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:22,797
before the bell rings 12 times.

436
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,134
Where is it? Darn it.

437
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:31,890
Damn it.

438
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,977
You are hereby appointed
as a dispatched angel

439
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,812
in charge of animals on the earth.

440
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:41,274
That's the handkerchief, isn't it?
The one that only dispatched angels get.

441
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:44,110
This certifies your identity as an angel,

442
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:46,404
and it connects the earth with the sky,

443
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:48,406
so you cannot lose it.

444
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:50,867
Make sure you always keep it with you.

445
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,036
No.

446
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,329
No.

447
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:55,872
It can't be.

448
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:01,044
Come out, you coward.

449
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:02,962
You phony...

450
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:05,006
religious jerk!

451
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:09,844
Cramps...

452
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,898
You keep having nightmares.

453
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,025
All of my dreams are nightmares.

454
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,818
They're all in bright colors.

455
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,906
-Tomorrow--
-I won't go to Fantasia.

456
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:34,994
I was going to ask you what time
you want to go to the columbarium.

457
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:38,081
How thoughtless.

458
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:40,041
How can they decide to do that
on this day?

459
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:41,709
Yeon-seo.

460
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,087
I'm always on your side no matter what.

461
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:46,714
Mr. Cho.

462
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:49,425
I sometimes get creeped out.

463
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,096
How can you be on my side no matter what?

464
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,807
How can you tune everything to me?

465
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,433
Why are you on my side
no matter what I do?

466
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,477
You should be calling me
the crazy princess,

467
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,853
little brat, and irritated rascal.

468
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:02,897
Isn't it normal to do that?

469
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:08,069
-Yeon-seo.
-Don't call me that.

470
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:11,489
Leave. I'm tired.

471
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,080
I know who you really are.

472
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:21,374
I told you to stop
pretending like you know.

473
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,515
THE 1999 ELENA BALLET SCHOOL RECITAL

474
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:47,900
Yeon-seo.

475
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,863
Goodness, I can't see the star of tonight.

476
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,156
It's all right.

477
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,615
He's our new secretary.

478
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,701
Hello, Princess.

479
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,703
My name is Cho Seung-hwan.

480
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,580
I hope we can get along.

481
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,624
-Yeon-seo.
-Mr. Cho!

482
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:06,294
Gosh.

483
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:07,503
How did I do?

484
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:09,172
You were the best.

485
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:12,050
I only get relieved after you tell me
that I was the best.

486
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,261
Goodness, you got the Grand Award.

487
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,896
It's because the sun
went down in your heart.

488
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,648
You were such a bright child.

489
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:31,778
No matter what anyone says,
even if you deny it,

490
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,237
you are like an angel.

491
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,075
I want to see you smile

492
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:41,871
and shine brightly like you did then
just one more time.

493
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,713
That rude kid.

494
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:03,976
Sleep well.

495
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,491
Where is it? Where did you put it?

496
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,177
I'm so annoyed.

497
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,097
I'm so irked and annoyed!

498
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:08,875
Hold on. I don't have to act this way.

499
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:33,649
What's wrong with this?

500
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:39,113
Is it stuck?

501
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,581
Mr. Cho needs to go out today.

502
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,124
So we need a temporary secretary

503
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:34,210
who'll be by Ms. Lee's side today.

504
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:35,211
Any volunteers?

505
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:36,254
No?

506
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:38,339
A 100-percent bonus and a 1-week leave!

507
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,092
Says who?

508
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,059
She's wearing a designer dress

509
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,520
and bedazzling false eyelashes.

510
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,982
This means
she's attending the party, right?

511
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,027
The makeup looks great on you.

512
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:02,280
You'll look prettier than Ni-na.

513
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,282
I've always been prettier than her.

514
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,242
Didn't you know that?

515
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:10,788
Will you be all right?

516
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,081
Let's go.

517
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:34,353
They will perform

518
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,814
Swan Lake during the party.

519
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:38,316
Don't be ridiculous.

520
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,443
I won't sit there in front of the stage
looking stupid.

521
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:43,154
But you can feel it.

522
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:44,989
And you already know the story.

523
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,365
That's exactly why

524
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,076
it'll be even more torturous.

525
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:50,786
Do I need to spell it out for you?

526
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:55,291
You are a foolish one.

527
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:57,418
You're always despicable.

528
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:01,881
Where's my handkerchief?

529
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:03,799
Since you've decided to attend the party,

530
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:06,719
you might as well show them
who the true owner of Fantasia is.

531
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:08,512
I told you. I'm not interested.

532
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:10,931
You can have it.

533
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,308
I'll stamp all the documents.

534
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:14,602
Gosh, was she awarded
a certificate for this?

535
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:17,646
She must have one for being the most
snide and despicable.

536
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,815
Then why are you going?

537
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,028
Yeon-seo.

538
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:25,446
Don't talk to me. You're too loud.

539
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:38,125
Blessed are those who have patience.

540
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:42,088
This foolish one
may not be aware of it now,

541
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:44,590
but she will appreciate you one day.

542
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:49,637
She will cry and regret her past actions.

543
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:53,933
Give it to me. Where is it?

544
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:26,298
Yeon-seo!

545
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,845
I'm so glad that my niece is here!

546
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:35,015
You two are in big trouble.

547
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,309
This foolish one has no patience for you.

548
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:40,229
Watch out for her stick.

549
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,107
Have you been well?

550
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:44,942
Of course.

551
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:48,362
We've cried so much, wanting to see you.

552
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:51,157
You never met us for the past three years.

553
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,408
But today, you're here.

554
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:55,035
Your parents must be proud of you.

555
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:56,162
This is great.

556
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:59,331
Our guests are very high-minded,

557
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,959
and they wanted to meet you.

558
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:03,919
You don't need to do anything.

559
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,839
That'll be better since you're pretty.
It will make you look more tragic.

560
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,341
The rich tend to spend money

561
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,760
when they feel a sense of superiority.

562
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:15,097
Mom, that's enough.

563
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:17,600
Please understand.

564
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:20,144
As the General Director
of the ballet company,

565
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:22,897
she's always thinking about sponsorships.

566
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:24,523
Ru-na.

567
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,360
You remember my voice.

568
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:30,946
I'm glad you're here.

569
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:32,239
Let's go in.

570
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:35,868
Goodness, Ni-na will be exhilarated.

571
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:39,622
She used to cry dozens of times a day
because she missed you.

572
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:42,041
-Let's go inside.
-Let's go.

573
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,275
Ni-na. Good luck.

574
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:10,444
You can do it.

575
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:16,867
You're the best.

576
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:19,161
The prima ballerina of Fantasia

577
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:21,956
is only you, Ni-na.

578
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:23,624
You're the star.

579
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:26,877
-Isn't that Yeon-seo?
-Is it her?

580
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,966
-She's really blind.
-It wasn't a rumor.

581
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:33,634
-It was real.
-Goodness.

582
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,344
Poor girl.

583
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:39,431
-My goodness.
-I feel terrible for her.

584
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:40,641
Do you want to wait in the car?

585
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:42,434
I need to go to the restroom.

586
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,605
-It's on your left.
-I can go by myself.

587
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,274
It's right around the corner.

588
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:49,900
You can go in first.

589
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,746
Gosh. My handkerchief

590
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,015
-Hello.
-Goodness.

591
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:39,783
No way. Yeon-seo is here?

592
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:40,993
Did you see her?

593
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:42,870
Don't address her like that.

594
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:44,997
She was once my idol.

595
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:46,790
Call her, "Ms. Lee."

596
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:48,459
By the way,

597
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:52,296
I don't understand why she came
when she's blind.

598
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:53,881
I hope she doesn't jinx any of us.

599
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:55,799
The performance will begin soon.

600
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:56,800
-Let's go.
-Okay.

601
00:43:56,884 --> 00:44:00,054
Please make your way to the theater.

602
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:45,821
Yeon-seo.

603
00:47:47,864 --> 00:47:48,865
Yeon-seo

604
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:53,537
Gosh, hello.

605
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,749
How have you been, sir?

606
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:59,167
I hope you've been well too, Odette.

607
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:00,627
You get prettier every year.

608
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,798
Hello, madam.

609
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,592
Hello, sir.

610
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:12,973
Where is the real Odette?

611
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:15,100
I've been looking for her,
but I can't find her.

612
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:17,477
She'll be here soon.

613
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:19,146
It's been three years, you know.

614
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:21,690
Yeon-seo.

615
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:31,491
Where is she?
The ceremony is about to start.

616
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:33,660
Everyone, please raise your glasses.

617
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,245
-What should we do?
-To celebrate the 20th

618
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:36,913
anniversary of Fantasia
Cultural Foundation,

619
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:38,123
we have invited a special guest.

620
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:40,208
She's the only daughter
of the first chairman.

621
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:42,794
Hey, we have to get him
to shut his mouth first.

622
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:44,046
Go.

623
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:45,922
We have invited Ms. Lee Yeon-seo.

624
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:48,759
Give her a warm welcome.

625
00:48:49,968 --> 00:48:51,261
It's been three years.

626
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:53,972
The daughter of Fantasia.
The madonna of Fantasia.

627
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:57,017
Where are you, Ms. Lee Yeon-seo?

628
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:55,117
Hello, I'm Lee Yeon-seo.

629
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:57,661
Today is a special day.

630
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:00,163
It's the 20th anniversary of Fantasia

631
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:02,666
as well as my parents' death anniversary.

632
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,753
I've given a lot of thought

633
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:08,338
on how to celebrate this occasion.

634
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:10,173
I thought about showing up

635
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:11,967
as a corpse by hanging myself
in the restroom.

636
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:14,803
To make a dramatic scene.

637
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:20,308
I bet everyone is looking at me with pity.

638
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:23,353
I hope that you can support us

639
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:25,105
as much as you pity me

640
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:27,566
and as much as you think
that I deserve this.

641
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:36,450
As you know,
when I was the only principal dancer here,

642
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:38,910
Keum Ni-na was my understudy.

643
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:40,328
In other words, she was my shadow.

644
00:50:41,037 --> 00:50:42,581
If I got sick

645
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:44,583
or ran away because I fell in love,

646
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:47,002
her responsibility was to take my place.

647
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:49,963
Unfortunately, I was too healthy.

648
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:52,215
And except ballet,
I found everything boring.

649
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:54,634
I've never skipped a performance.

650
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:58,305
However, when the sun is gone,
the moon is bound to dominate.

651
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:01,099
As you all know, I've lost my eyesight.

652
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:03,477
And Ni-na made a successful debut
as my replacement.

653
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:05,896
When I was living in
darkness for three years,

654
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:09,107
Ni-na has been shining
as Fantasia's prima ballerina.

655
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:11,151
Isn't this story

656
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:12,986
quite dramatic?

657
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:15,864
Please support generously
to our ballet company,

658
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:18,074
Fantasia, as much as you find

659
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:20,076
this story entertaining

660
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,913
and as much as
you'll share it with others.

661
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:32,339
I apologize for my long toast.

662
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:34,633
Enjoy your day today.

663
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:37,302
No one can be sure
if you'll be okay the next day.

664
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:47,687
Let go. Let go of me.

665
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:52,234
Ms. Choi!

666
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:53,735
You've crossed the line.

667
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:55,278
Get your hand off me.

668
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,199
I know that you are rude to the core

669
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:01,034
and that you do everything you want to do

670
00:52:01,117 --> 00:52:02,619
like a spoiled princess.

671
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:04,496
But this was just too much.

672
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:07,999
You should've braced yourself when you had
a party on my parents' death anniversary.

673
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:11,169
Those people inside

674
00:52:12,128 --> 00:52:13,839
are in the first percentile
of this country.

675
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:15,966
Their seconds and minutes are like gold.

676
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:18,927
Do you think it's easy
to accommodate their schedules?

677
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:20,971
What? You're laughing?

678
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:24,808
Hey.

679
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:27,853
Since we're at it, let's be frank here.

680
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:30,313
How have we wronged you?

681
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:31,523
What do you have against us

682
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:33,400
to come all the way here
and ruin this event?

683
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:34,818
You smiled.

684
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:39,990
You smiled that day.

685
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:41,283
Oh, no!

686
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:42,450
Yeon-seo!

687
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:43,994
Yeon-seo!

688
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:58,466
Goodness.

689
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,051
Oh, my.

690
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,013
You're unbelievable.

691
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:06,391
I'm your aunt.

692
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:08,184
Sure. You could say...

693
00:53:10,186 --> 00:53:14,065
that we're a distant cousin.

694
00:53:14,482 --> 00:53:16,484
But we're still a family.

695
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:20,030
There's a line you can't cross.

696
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:22,324
I thought you were just blind,

697
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:24,284
but is it possible
that you've gone mad too?

698
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:26,620
Stop.

699
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:29,998
What if I don't?

700
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:32,000
There will be a bigger scene.

701
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:39,925
Let's go.

702
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:16,604
You foolish one.

703
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:19,649
The beautiful dance of your feet

704
00:55:20,316 --> 00:55:22,569
melted away the foul words
on the tip of your mouth.

705
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:26,072
You should thank the one
who has given you that talent.

706
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:02,067
It looks like the sun will set.

707
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:04,069
The sunset glow is very beautiful.

708
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:06,196
It's...

709
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:09,115
very beautiful.

710
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:17,999
Let's start getting ready slowly.

711
00:56:18,374 --> 00:56:19,667
You can begin your rehabilitation.

712
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:21,211
-And the foundation--
-Stop.

713
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:23,505
Yeon-seo.

714
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,298
I told you to stop calling me that!

715
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:27,258
I hate everything!

716
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:29,761
I hate ballet, the foundation, everything!

717
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:31,596
So don't tell me what to do!

718
00:56:36,392 --> 00:56:37,477
Lee Yeon-seo!

719
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:40,563
Did you

720
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:42,857
just yell at me?

721
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:45,735
Pull yourself together.

722
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:47,779
You're in the middle of a battlefield.

723
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:50,448
Do you know how many guns
are pointed at your heart?

724
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:53,159
No idea, but I hope
I can die at once, quickly.

725
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:54,953
And stop saying that you want to die.

726
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:57,872
We're almost there.

727
00:56:58,414 --> 00:57:01,042
If you give me just a little more time,

728
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:03,419
I will bring you back to your place.

729
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:06,464
My place?

730
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:08,299
How?

731
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:09,843
Are you going to give me eyes?

732
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:11,386
-Yeon-seo.
-Bring me back?

733
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:13,513
Where? Who says you can?
Who do you think you are?

734
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:15,640
If you act like my dad once again,

735
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:17,684
I will really fire you.

736
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:03,271
Mr. Cho.

737
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:15,783
Yeon-seo. Yeon-seo, hold tight!

738
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:25,919
What is it? What's going on?

739
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:27,629
Yeon-seo.

740
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:47,899
Gosh, I might be late.

741
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:49,734
Mr. Cho...

742
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:28,481
Mr. Cho.

743
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:31,651
Can you hear me?

744
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:34,862
Mr. Cho?

745
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:57,343
Is anybody there?

746
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:02,682
Help us.

747
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:08,521
Who knew these flowers were for a funeral?

748
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:25,163
Rest

749
01:00:26,247 --> 01:00:27,123
in peace.

750
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:32,879
Who's there?

751
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:37,759
Is...

752
01:00:39,344 --> 01:00:40,470
Is someone there?

753
01:00:43,389 --> 01:00:44,432
Over here.

754
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:47,143
There are people here. Over here.

755
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:50,521
Please.

756
01:00:51,105 --> 01:00:53,566
Please help us. Please.

757
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,696
Hey, who are you?

758
01:00:59,572 --> 01:01:01,240
Are you a human or an animal?

759
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:04,952
You jerk.

760
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:07,622
Don't you have any conscience?

761
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:09,957
If you ran away because you were scared,

762
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:12,460
make a report at least.

763
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:14,003
Mister.

764
01:01:14,796 --> 01:01:16,255
Sir. Hey.

765
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:19,133
Whoever you are, please.

766
01:01:21,135 --> 01:01:22,387
Why does her voice sound so clear?

767
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:41,155
Help me.

768
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:43,574
I can't.

769
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:46,035
I really should not interfere
with the life of human beings.

770
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:47,870
Please.

771
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:49,831
Save me.

772
01:01:51,082 --> 01:01:53,710
I can't. I have no time. I have to go.

773
01:01:55,169 --> 01:01:56,337
I want to live.

774
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,508
I wanted to die every single day,

775
01:02:02,468 --> 01:02:03,594
but I want to live now.

776
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:06,097
I want to live.

777
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:12,937
I wanted to die every single day,

778
01:02:15,481 --> 01:02:16,858
but I want to live now.

779
01:03:01,819 --> 01:03:02,653
I shouldn't

780
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:04,614
have done that.

781
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:06,783
I was not

782
01:03:07,658 --> 01:03:09,076
supposed to do that.

783
01:03:43,694 --> 01:03:44,695
Like smoke

784
01:03:45,738 --> 01:03:46,656
and dust.

785
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:51,077
Hey, is someone there?

786
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:52,578
Ms. Lee, were you dreaming?

787
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:56,541
You must successfully
carry out a mission for 100 days

788
01:03:56,624 --> 01:03:58,334
for the door to reopen.

789
01:03:58,417 --> 01:04:00,920
Hello. I'm Kim Dan, the interviewee.

790
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:02,088
I got closer to her.

791
01:04:03,422 --> 01:04:05,132
Why does a secretary
have to learn to do this?

792
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:06,467
Make sure this place is spotless.

793
01:04:07,593 --> 01:04:09,095
What is my mission?

794
01:04:10,429 --> 01:04:11,347
Love.

795
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:12,974
I will make you learn to love.
