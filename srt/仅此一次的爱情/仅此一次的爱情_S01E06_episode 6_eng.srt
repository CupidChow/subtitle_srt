1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:03,030
     

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:07,030
I'm sorry. For joking around that you were probably dumped at sunset.

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,010
As long as you know, that's fine.

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:11,410
Thank you.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,330
I found hope now... from you.

6
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:19,630
That you are someone who can love.

7
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,530
Love?

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,090
Your heart tickles

9
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,560
and you get to smile constantly and you feel like jumping up and down with happiness. That's love.

10
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,950
Kim Dan, you got it wrong.

11
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,800
I don't understand your weird preference but I won't fire you because of that.

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,010
So, don't sweet-talk me or go overboard.

13
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:59,020
I'll do it for you.

14
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,150
I can do it.

15
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,740
Stop talking nonsense. Who do you think you are?

16
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,300
Someone who exists only for you.

17
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,190
I'll be honest.

18
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,090
The purpose of my life

19
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,750
is you.

20
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,350
Are you crazy?

21
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,690
Oh, rain! What?

22
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,560
Go get an umbrella.

23
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,700
What is he saying?

24
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,860
Thank you.

25
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,060
Oh no, I forgot about that.

26
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,840
Oh, why? Ugh!

27
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:17,020
You'll catch a cold. I was waiting in the car, but it started to rain.

28
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,150
Let's go now.

29
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,800
I have to wait for Kim Dan.

30
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,230
You seem very close to him.

31
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,060
It's the first time I'm seeing you speak to your secretary informally.

32
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,610
It somehow ended up that way. At least he is doing his job well.

33
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,630
Then I'll wait for him with you.

34
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:04,300
Time spent waiting is precious. Do you want to see something fun with me?

35
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,430
Excuse me?

36
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,720
Just one minute.

37
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,480
You carry things like this around with you?

38
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,450
Of course, I purposely prepared this.

39
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,340
Because I wanted to show you.

40
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,700
Won't you even give me 30 minutes?

41
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:46,000
2006 in Moscow Swanhildain  "Coppelia."

42
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,170
Ballet's deity loves this young, East-Asian girl.

43
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:56,200
2007 in Berlin "Romantic Etude."

44
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:01,480
The black-haired girl's dazzling flying.

45
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:08,070
2008 in London, "Nutcracker," "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy."

46
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:15,250
The goddess of the alluring and mysterious dream.

47
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:19,840
2009 in Lausanne, "Don Quixote: Kitri."

48
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,520
Fantastic. Fantastic. Fantastic.

49
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,790
I like you.

50
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:50,060
Because I like you, I'm going crazy.

51
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:55,110
You are not someone who should be walking around wearing gym shoes.

52
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:59,660
Because you are someone who should be stepping on the clouds to jump over Heaven but you are just staying still.

53
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:04,840
Ballet... Let's do it again together.

54
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:14,960
When we arrive home, it will be late. The person who went to get an umbrella arrived after the rain stopped.

55
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,020
At least it's safer to drive when it's not raining.

56
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,720
It's all right. It will be all right. I'm here, Yeon Seo.

57
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,100
 It's all right.  Everything will be all right now

58
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:46,110
since I'm here, Lee Yeon Seo.

59
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,540
That day.

60
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,800
Was it you? The day of the accident?

61
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,910
I'm giving this to you now.

62
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:32,130
Then the person who called the ambulance.

63
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,180
The person who held my hand,

64
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,400
was it you, Ji Kang Woo?

65
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:43,070
- You remember now? 
 - Why didn't you tell me right away?

66
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,910
It's not something to brag about.

67
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:50,100
I'm sorry to have startled you. I will drive more carefully.

68
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:55,720
 Bone for bone, flesh for flesh. 

69
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:01,910
 Lee Yeon Seo's rib. That's what humans call fate. 

70
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,970
Thank you for driving so far today.

71
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:31,170
I'm more thankful that you made time for me.

72
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,510
Let's go in.

73
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,340
Please wait.

74
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,070
What is it?

75
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:51,330
It's a bribe... to try and get closer to your secretary.

76
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:54,450
I bought one last night as well, but it got ruined.

77
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:58,860
But I can buy as many as needed.

78
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,860
Here. Please take good care of it.

79
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,010
     

80
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:22,790
Gwang Il, let's just say it never happened.

81
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,860
How can I?

82
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,760
When it was something that definitely happened.

83
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,990
What is it?

84
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:32,630
I've been hearing that you've been drinking every day since Jo's funeral.

85
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,650
It keeps coming in my dreams.

86
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,220
What does?

87
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,890
It's too scary.

88
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:45,210
 But whenever there was a suitable donor, there was someone who would contact her first. 

89
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:48,230
 After that call, the donation was canceled. 

90
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,880
 I made that phone call. 

91
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,990
 I know. It must have been the leader's order. 

92
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,630
 Manager Park, I didn't realize you were this kind of person. 

93
00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:01,940
 Wait. I must do what I'm told in order to make a living, Hyungnim. 

94
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:06,090
 Still, the person who will get his hands dirty 

95
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,220
 is you, Manager Park. 

96
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:15,210
 Before something worse happens, tell her 

97
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,490
 to leave Fantasia quietly. 

98
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,750
 That's not it... Mr. Jo 

99
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,060
I thought he was just saying those words.

100
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:28,620
North Korea and South Korea always argue verbally, but they haven't resorted to violence.

101
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,940
  The brake line was cut.  

102
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:41,760
  It was like someone cut it intentionally.   

103
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:48,890
I only went to pound the car because the leader said to.

104
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,860
Are you in your right mind? How can you just leave Ivy Mansion?

105
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,560
Did they call the cops?

106
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,970
What are you going to do if you were caught on the CCTV?

107
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:12,700
I felt that if I stayed there any longer, the others would expose me.

108
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:19,460
So what about the documents collected by Mr. Jo.

109
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:24,250
His room key is in the possession of Ms. Yeon Seo.

110
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:28,290
After that ruckus, you got fired empty-handed.

111
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:30,100
I'm sorry.

112
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:33,310
So annoying.

113
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:36,190
He annoys me even when he's dead.

114
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:18,460
He never listens.

115
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,740
I told you to throw it all out.

116
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,700
   

117
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,710
 Let's do ballet again, together. 

118
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:39,550
 I don't want to. I danced all the dances I want and got all the honor I can. 

119
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:44,540
 I don't have any regrets. So stop concerning yourself with my affairs. 

120
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:48,120
 You can reach a higher spot, Yeon Seo. You have to. 

121
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,100
 - Just once. Trust me. 
 - Wow. 

122
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,590
 You just became the most untrustable person in the world by saying that. 

123
00:11:55,590 --> 00:12:00,310
 "Trust me. I'm different from others. I'm sincere." These are just cliches. 

124
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:03,380
 I became an orphan at 17. I've heard this way too many times. 

125
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:07,040
 The more affectionate they are, the more they want from me. 

126
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:14,360
She doesn't want to. She flatly rejected me.

127
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:24,630
What can I do to restart Lee Yeon Seo's heart?

128
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:41,260
 You can do it! Who said the world is full of dance? 

129
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,270
You, my dear.

130
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,710
   

131
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,440
   

132
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,510
   

133
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:06,680
He has no background or connections.

134
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,170
No money or ambition.

135
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:13,320
Did they get close easily because he has nothing?

136
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:30,490
What is love?

137
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,720
♫  I like where we are heading now  ♫

138
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,210
Do you have a rib of fate?

139
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:44,160
♫  These little feelings I suppose  ♫

140
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,550
♫  You're like the noises in my ear  ♫

141
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,150
♫  Can't think of reasons when you're there  ♫

142
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:54,570
My mission target:

143
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,830
To find out about Lee Yeon Seo's love.

144
00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:01,820
♫  I think of you and when I don't  ♫

145
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:05,520
I think I found it.

146
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,050
But I also think I haven't. How do I know if he's really her fate or not?

147
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:10,590
What if he's not the fated match for Yeon Seo,

148
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,140
♫  I admit I'm a little choked...  ♫

149
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,780
Could it come to me?

150
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,920
♫  I'm crazy over you  ♫

151
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,680
What if he's not the one?

152
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:24,990
♫  You can tell me anything so that can make me stay  ♫

153
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:28,700
Ah really? Stop being so harsh on me!

154
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:44,710
Not again with this unrefined habit of yours. Just sit down

155
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,320
Thank you.

156
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:59,590
You're soon going to be the official chairman of the Fantasia board members soon.

157
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:02,910
Let's live up to it straight to our bones, okay?

158
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,590
Why? Is there something on my face?

159
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,090
Eye booger. Left.

160
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,680
Good morning.

161
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,760
Did you sleep well?

162
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:24,280
I have something to say.

163
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:29,490
I had a discussion with Roo Na and

164
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:33,150
I think we've been too mean to Yeon Seo.

165
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:36,670
After the incident at the hospital, we couldn't even check up on her.

166
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:39,190
We're still family after all.

167
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:42,350
I've been totally occupied mentally so I couldn't pay attention to her.

168
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,350
What do we do?

169
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,550
What do you mean?

170
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:50,350
There are so many people there to take care of her.

171
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:54,060
They'll make sure that she's well fed and living comfortab--

172
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:58,570
Oh, I'm worried if she is okay.

173
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:02,910
Right, we've been too insensitive. Right?

174
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,680
Goo Reum! 
(His name translates to 'Cloud')

175
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:22,240
Wake up, Lee Goo Reum! Lee Goo Reum!

176
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,310
Goo Reum. Wake up, Goo Reum. Goo Reum.

177
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:29,740
What did you feed Goo Reum, Kim Dan!

178
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,860
Goo Reum! Goo Reum!

179
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:39,890
It was a small amount so he should be fine. He should be admitted and we can continue observing him.

180
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,630
How did you give him chocolate?

181
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:46,930
He must have eaten the pieces my employee dropped.

182
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:53,450
I only have Goo Reum left.

183
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,410
If I don't have Goo Reum,

184
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:59,220
I really don't have anyone.

185
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,980
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

186
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,220
I want to stop hearing

187
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:09,490
you say you're sorry, Kim Dan.

188
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:12,420
But why are you alone?

189
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:17,200
You have me, the butler and the employees.

190
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:21,320
Are you going to be by my side till I die?

191
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,920
You said you exist for me, that I'm your goal in life.

192
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:34,400
That's right, but...

193
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,560
That's enough. You're being too noisy.

194
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,950
Here.

195
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,200
I only copied it in a rush.

196
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,420
It's nothing.

197
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,000
You should rest.

198
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,030
Congratulations. Congratulations.

199
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:32,300
We congratulate you on your recovery.

200
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,220
Everyone, you missed Korea's best ballerina,

201
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,200
- Lee Yeon Seo. 
 - Turn it off.

202
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,660
As you can see this is a surprise party that we have prepared.

203
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,740
- She can see again now.
 - This is fun.

204
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,430
 - To my one and only cousin  
- Right?

205
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:49,680
Please send a lot of hearts and congratulatory messages!

206
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,580
What is that guy doing?

207
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,880
I said turn it off.

208
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:05,780
The candle has gone out.

209
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,850
Who let you in?

210
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:09,240
They know we're your family.

211
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,760
Honey, yeon Seo's here! Come down quickly!

212
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,970
She's upstairs?

213
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:17,340
With who's permission!

214
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:26,890
I wish I could just burn everything.

215
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:29,990
That will make everything easier.

216
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:38,320
Slow down, you'll fall.

217
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,560
You're here, Yeon Seo.

218
00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:02,750
This place is the same. You must have taken good care of it.

219
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:10,610
I heard it's still hard without him.

220
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,830
Poor girl.

221
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:18,140
   

222
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:29,160
Since we're all here,

223
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,480
let's all have a glass of congratulatory wine.

224
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,680
Let's sit.

225
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,950
Get out. I'm tired.

226
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:40,850
Yeon Seo, can't you open your heart a little bit?

227
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:43,440
We're all trying to congratulate you—

228
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,870
I received those eyes after someone died.

229
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,240
Is it something to congratulate by throwing a party?

230
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,730
I prayed for you every day.

231
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:54,480
I prayed that you'd recover quickly so we can perform on one stage.

232
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,980
You were kind since you were little, right?

233
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:02,560
You're like that because you want to be acknowledged by others except for me,

234
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,540
since you couldn't beat me with other things.

235
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,810
Since there were none!

236
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:13,020
Let's get this straight! In the past, I couldn't beat you

237
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,950
three years ago when your eyes were fine.

238
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,700
You should leave. It's for the best.

239
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:33,480
Okay. Let's go.

240
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:38,000
Let's go. Let's go, Ni Na.

241
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:53,380
I must be crazy. Why did I do that?

242
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:57,870
You did a great job. I feel so refreshed.

243
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:02,130
Let's go. Let's go, quickly.

244
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,630
You said that was your aunt. Why are you being like this?

245
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:18,360
Your family was here to celebrate with you.

246
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,320
Be quiet.

247
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:22,820
But I don't get—

248
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,220
I told you to just shush!

249
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,220
Lee Yeon Seo!

250
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,760
This is your problem. I'm a little nice to you and then you get rebellious with me.

251
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,250
Don't order me around. You don't have that right.

252
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,470
No! I'm going to keep doing it,

253
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:34,580
because I'm a human with a conscience and sense of manners.

254
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:37,430
I'm telling you a person can't act as you do.

255
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,450
What did I do?

256
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:41,550
How long are you going to keep acting however you please?

257
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,970
Are you five? Even a child knows better!

258
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:45,670
They were here to congratulate you.

259
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:50,630
Did you have to bash someone that was reaching out to wish you happiness?

260
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:53,160
I can bash someone if I want. It's my decision.

261
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,960
You're the one that's going to be hurt in the end.

262
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,630
Let me make this clear to you. You're here as Mr. Jo's replacement.

263
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:01,790
Mr. Jo let me do whatever I wanted to.

264
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:06,790
If I didn't want to do something, I didn't have to. And if I wanted to do something, he'd do whatever it took to make it possible.

265
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:09,980
I'm Kim Dan. I'm not that pitiful old man!

266
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,820
What?

267
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,980
It figures. How can I blame that innocent man?

268
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:19,150
He was just too nice to a girl who thinks she rules the world and throws a fit whenever she doesn't get her way.

269
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:22,440
How could he have known he was doing more harm than good?

270
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:27,920
This is what I get for pitying you being left alone in this world and taking you in? How dare you?

271
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,750
When you have enough sense to pity someone that has no one in this world,

272
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,600
why are you acting so tetchy with the only family you have left?

273
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,140
You'll regret it.

274
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:38,120
Do you want to wait for them to die like your parents and Mr. Jo did before you regret it?

275
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:43,480
What if it was the last time? What if you can't reverse it? You idiot, gong-face!

276
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,730
That's enough!

277
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,020
Did you just throw that at me?

278
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:52,970
Yeah, what of it?

279
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:55,130
Take this!

280
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,400
You little—!

281
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:02,330
Ouch!

282
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:04,000
Gosh, stop it!

283
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:08,250
Let's just stop. Okay?

284
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,980
- Why you—! 
 - Ouch!

285
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,890
Let go!

286
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:16,300
You let go!

287
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,020
Darn it!

288
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,370
It'll be a problem if your blood pressure rises. How about we let go on three? Deal?

289
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:23,590
- Deal. 
 - Okay. Then let's do this.

290
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:26,100
Ready? One, two, three— Ouch!

291
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,460
You're fired!

292
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,530
Wow, that's just great! I can't take it anymore!

293
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:34,110
I was a fool for even thinking there was hope for you.

294
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:38,450
A girl with not an ounce of remorse like you is hopeless and doomed for life. Even a noisy gong is better than you!

295
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:41,520
How can such a loveless person exist?!

296
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:44,150
Ugh, so annoying!

297
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:02,910
   

298
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:07,570
"Forgive us our trespasses...

299
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:13,700
as we forgive those that trespass against u—" Gosh, darn it!

300
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:18,190
What did I do wrong?! If I did anything wrong, tell me! Come on!

301
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:35,570
Have you really abandoned me?

302
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:48,170
   

303
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,600
♫   I look really exhausted today   ♫

304
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:01,030

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,650
Drink up.

307
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:14,290
When your heart's on fire, this is your only savior.

320
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:58,360
And you know she isn't the type to take people back after she fires them.

321
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,530
Why do you keep doing this?

322
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:03,060
Hmm...

323
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,800
Let's see.

324
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,090
I don't really know, honestly.

325
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:14,080
The lady looked a bit comfortable when she was with you.

326
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:19,050
And the way she bickers with you, she hasn't done that since she was ten years old.

327
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:21,460
♫   People say   ♫

328
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,930
She has to use the cane if you're not there.

329
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:27,210
♫   I will hit a rock with an egg   ♫

330
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:30,290
Just once.

331
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:31,240
Please?

332
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:35,550
♫   And even with the mental fragments   ♫

333
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,370
I can't lie.

334
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:42,410
I can't say I was wrong when I didn't do anything wrong. Never!

335
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:45,510
It's burning.

336
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,710
Drink this. It's chamomile.

337
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:54,890
You said you drink this when you can't sleep.

338
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:05,550
   

339
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,590
 Lee Yeon Seo?

♫  Summer heat with ice  ♫

346
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:36,240
Lee Yeon Seo can trip

and fall because of this.

349

Lee Yeon Seo hates this.

♫  If we could decide  ♫

351

♫  Something to show, show that you love me  ♫

354
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:09,160
She can slip because of this.

♫  Something to show, show that you love me  ♫

356

What are you doing?

357
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:19,670
Oh, it's our rude princess.

358
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:26,330
They didn't clean up so I should

359
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:28,420
since it's the last time.

360
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,630
Give me your access card.

361
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:37,300
You got hurt.

362
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:41,990
I'm sorry.

363
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,620
I told you I didn't want to hear that.

364
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:54,770
This is me.

365
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:57,760
Think of it as me.

366
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,300
You're fine when you're with me.

367
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:05,210
Even if I'm not there, it'll be like I'm there with you.

368
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,360
You can go anywhere if you have this.

369
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,100
I'll put a spell on it for you.

370
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:23,260
It would be great if you dance with this on, Lee Yeon Seo.

371
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:27,710
Don't think that there's someone targeting you all the time.

372
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:31,900
The feeling of people admiring your dance,

373
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,320
I hope you can feel that instead.

374
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:39,090
 I feel like someone's watching and targeting me all the time. 

375
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:41,660
 I wish that feeling was just me being delusional. 

376
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,000
♫  Your dreams that came up white  ♫

377
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,210
You're arrogant till the end.

378
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:50,820
"Trust me. I'm different from others. I'm sincere."

379
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:54,030
I wish you would believe that.

380
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:58,520
The more affectionate someone is to you, the more thankful you could be to them.

381

♫  Without trace on the streets  ♫

 "Trust me. I'm different from others. I'm sincere." 

383
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:09,780
 These are just cliches. I became an orphan at 17. I've heard these way too many times. 

384
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:13,950
 The more affectionate they are, the more that they want from me. 

385
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,530
♫  With these weary hearts  ♫

386
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:25,050
No. You don't have to show me later.

387
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,700
Dance with me right now!

388
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,610
This...

389
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:31,910

 I have to walk without the stick until next week. I have to, no matter what! 

408
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:34,130
 Instead, I have a condition. 

409

 Here, come to me. 

410
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:38,810
 Just think it's only you and me in this world. 

411
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:40,130
 Scammer. 

412

 Even when it time I have to go, this isn't right. 

413
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,360
 There is no ballerina that has three legs. 

414

 You were at the brink of death but you survived. I believe you will live a new life. 

415
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:53,390
 They were supposed to leave Lee Yeon Seo's name out of it and do a press call for the annual performance. 

416
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:57,170
 Whatever happens, don't help me.
