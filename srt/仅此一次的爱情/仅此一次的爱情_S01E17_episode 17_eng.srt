1
00:00:01,227 --> 00:00:04,327
  I want to stay with her. 

2
00:00:04,327 --> 00:00:09,087
 Even more so, now that I've left her side. 

3
00:00:09,087 --> 00:00:13,647
 If there is even one reason for me to stay, 

4
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:18,177
  then please help me find it. 

5
00:00:19,697 --> 00:00:25,277
  I don't care where that road leads me. I will gladly go down that road. 

6
00:00:27,657 --> 00:00:36,507
  r

7
00:00:42,507 --> 00:00:47,527
    
You said you were going to manage well. You said you would show me a great rendition of Giselle.

8
00:00:47,527 --> 00:00:49,397
Was this it?

9
00:00:49,397 --> 00:00:52,027
All I did was follow my heart.

10
00:00:52,027 --> 00:00:56,697
There are some people you can't bring yourself to hate no matter how you try.

11
00:00:56,697 --> 00:01:00,327
Is it still Kim Dan? Is that the problem?

12
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:04,537
Pull yourself together. I've gone through a breakup, too.

13
00:01:04,537 --> 00:01:09,097
I had to say goodbye to someone dear to me and have gone crazy before. I've been through that, too.

14
00:01:09,097 --> 00:01:13,257
I'm saying what you're feeling right now is nothing special.

15
00:01:13,257 --> 00:01:16,987
Then you must know it well, too. I think this is the right thing.

16
00:01:16,987 --> 00:01:22,337
I may get angry and be resentful, but in the end, I really miss him. That's why I am sad.

17
00:01:22,337 --> 00:01:25,757
With only sadness, you will never be able to do anything!

18
00:01:26,367 --> 00:01:28,547
If Giselle and Albrecht really loved each other,

19
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:32,187
in the end, they should die together.

20
00:01:34,797 --> 00:01:40,807
It must be her. The one who has been put to rest in the temple. The ballerina.

21
00:01:40,807 --> 00:01:45,017
Stop saying unnecessary things. It has nothing to do with the work.

22
00:01:45,017 --> 00:01:49,037
Please, don't disappoint me anymore.

23
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:14,377
     

24
00:02:31,907 --> 00:02:33,777
    

25
00:02:37,237 --> 00:02:42,447
    
 ♫  When a cold wind touches  
  through my two cheeks,  ♫

26
00:02:42,447 --> 00:02:45,477
 Hey, Noisy Gong. You can roam all you want, 

27
00:02:45,477 --> 00:02:49,057
 start dancing, and lose that temper, too. 

28
00:02:50,977 --> 00:02:54,797
How dare you save my name as Noisy Gong.

29
00:02:56,347 --> 00:03:02,447
♫  My head is full of you   ♫

30
00:03:02,447 --> 00:03:04,567
  Now, come to me.  

31
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:10,417
♫  I might have  ♫

32
00:03:10,417 --> 00:03:13,997
 Only look at me. In this world, it's you and me. 

33
00:03:13,997 --> 00:03:18,797
 Pretend that it's just the two of us. Okay? 

34
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:23,327
♫  filled up with thoughts of you  ♫

35
00:03:23,327 --> 00:03:31,257
♫  Tonight stars are pouring down, while I think of you alone,  ♫

36
00:03:31,257 --> 00:03:38,347
♫  Will you know I feel infatuated?  ♫

37
00:03:38,347 --> 00:03:40,737
  Your nose is running.  

38
00:03:40,737 --> 00:03:43,067
♫  On a night when cherry blossoms are scattering  ♫

39
00:03:43,067 --> 00:03:46,717
♫  Through the warm wind under the moonlight  ♫

40
00:03:46,717 --> 00:03:55,437
♫  I long for you all alone  ♫

41
00:04:09,267 --> 00:04:14,187
I knew it. I can never sleep well whenever I sleep in a different place.

42
00:04:16,947 --> 00:04:19,797
I want to go home.

43
00:04:22,727 --> 00:04:24,607
This late at night?

44
00:04:35,617 --> 00:04:37,437
The secretary quits of his own accord,

45
00:04:37,437 --> 00:04:40,347
and the boss's heart is shaken to the core.

46
00:04:40,967 --> 00:04:43,067
My poor life.

47
00:04:45,287 --> 00:04:47,717
What's wrong? What is it?

48
00:04:47,717 --> 00:04:51,407
You already knew that your hired hands clean up this place in the morning and night with all sorts of state-of-the-art technology.

49
00:04:51,407 --> 00:04:53,117
Why did you turn this place upside down?

50
00:04:53,117 --> 00:04:55,377
Go back to sleep. I can do this alone.

51
00:04:55,377 --> 00:04:58,957
Did you have a dream about the person whose name I can't say?

52
00:05:00,327 --> 00:05:05,467
I can't believe this. You were doing fine for several days.

53
00:05:05,467 --> 00:05:10,127
I did dream about something, but it's not that.

54
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:15,327
Clean more. Until all the dust and your regret disappear, vacuum as much as you want.

55
00:05:15,327 --> 00:05:18,077
That's not it.

56
00:05:21,917 --> 00:05:24,297
I dreamed of my childhood.

57
00:05:24,927 --> 00:05:29,767
Childhood? When? Why?

58
00:05:30,517 --> 00:05:34,957
I know, right? Why did he appear in my dream?

59
00:05:34,957 --> 00:05:36,857
I lived without remembering him.

60
00:05:36,857 --> 00:05:41,027
It's probably because you're in distress. You have no one to rely on.

61
00:05:42,397 --> 00:05:45,107
You should get some fresh air.

62
00:05:45,107 --> 00:05:49,467
Reminisce about the good, old days. If possible, meet an old friend, too.

63
00:05:49,467 --> 00:05:50,967
The audition is right around the corner.

64
00:05:50,967 --> 00:05:52,957
That's why you should quickly recover your senses.

65
00:05:52,957 --> 00:05:55,407
I am more in my right mind than anybody.

66
00:05:55,407 --> 00:05:59,327
How can you say that when you're torturing yourself this late at night?

67
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:05,177
Whenever your feelings were wavering, you recovered over there.

68
00:06:05,177 --> 00:06:08,267
Who knows? What if it happens, like magic,

69
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:11,387
that you find a solution there once again?

70
00:06:19,787 --> 00:06:22,357
- Where are you? 
  - I contacted the office. 

71
00:06:22,357 --> 00:06:23,927
I'm going to rest just for today.

72
00:06:23,927 --> 00:06:27,617
Where are you?  We'll talk when you get here. I'll tell you everything 

73
00:06:27,617 --> 00:06:32,407
about why it had to be a tragedy,  and why it had to be you. 

74
00:06:32,407 --> 00:06:37,137
I also wish I could have the same dream as you.

75
00:06:37,707 --> 00:06:42,107
 But you know very well that we can't force it. 

76
00:06:42,107 --> 00:06:44,437
I'll also rethink everything from the start,

77
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:49,117
so please reconsider my dance, too.

78
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:52,397
You didn't answer me. Where are you? I'll go to you

79
00:06:52,397 --> 00:06:54,117
I'll see you later.

80
00:07:17,317 --> 00:07:19,207
I'll go this way.

81
00:07:19,827 --> 00:07:21,887
Isn't it indecent?

82
00:07:23,047 --> 00:07:27,527
Of course, the girl will escape. It's a detestable trait.

83
00:07:29,977 --> 00:07:32,347
I thought you were polite, but actually, you're unreasonable.

84
00:07:32,347 --> 00:07:37,037
What should I do? Should I burn everything down,

85
00:07:37,037 --> 00:07:40,397
or should I drown them all?

86
00:07:43,877 --> 00:07:46,867
Who are you? Where did you come from?

87
00:07:48,527 --> 00:07:50,397
You have a temper.

88
00:07:52,407 --> 00:07:55,017
Excuse me. Do you know me?

89
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:59,507
If you go around picking a fight, you'll get in trouble. Recover your senses.

90
00:08:01,237 --> 00:08:02,937
I came here to find out.

91
00:08:02,937 --> 00:08:06,757
She told me you're something but you're nothing but a noisy empty loser.

92
00:08:31,217 --> 00:08:34,287
     

93
00:08:55,287 --> 00:08:57,177
Why...

94
00:08:58,567 --> 00:09:00,997
are you here?

95
00:09:04,047 --> 00:09:05,757
I came looking for something.

96
00:09:05,757 --> 00:09:11,297
The thing is that I prayed because I wanted to know the reason.

97
00:09:11,297 --> 00:09:15,547
But I came to know the reason,

98
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:19,277
and my heart hurts a lot.

99
00:09:19,277 --> 00:09:21,997
What are you talking about?

100
00:09:21,997 --> 00:09:23,907
That...

101
00:09:25,277 --> 00:09:29,327
- There's— 
- Forget it. You don't have to explain.

102
00:09:34,487 --> 00:09:36,107
Don't follow me.

103
00:09:36,107 --> 00:09:37,907
Do your praying and whatever you need to do.

104
00:09:37,907 --> 00:09:40,157
I'll do the things I need to do.

105
00:09:56,247 --> 00:09:59,177
I told him not to come, here's really not coming?

106
00:10:02,217 --> 00:10:03,977
Forget it.

107
00:10:03,977 --> 00:10:07,727
I don't know you. He's not someone I know.

108
00:10:15,367 --> 00:10:17,817
     

109
00:10:25,887 --> 00:10:29,477
Welcome! Should I get you a room?

110
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:35,117
Do you know the house with the blue gate?

111
00:10:35,117 --> 00:10:38,327
Do you happen to know the house with the blue gate around here?

112
00:10:38,327 --> 00:10:41,537
It's been so long since I came here, so I'm not familiar with the roads.

113
00:10:41,537 --> 00:10:44,897
There are many houses with blue gates.

114
00:10:44,897 --> 00:10:51,387
In the past, about ten years ago, a little boy lived there.

115
00:10:51,387 --> 00:10:53,667
By the way, you look familiar.

116
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:55,587
Who are you? A celebrity?

117
00:10:55,587 --> 00:10:59,067
No, I'm a ballerina.

118
00:10:59,067 --> 00:11:01,457
I came here once in the past.

119
00:11:01,457 --> 00:11:04,997
You visited for several years.

120
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:08,237
Everyone in the neighborhood gathered to watch you dance.

121
00:11:08,237 --> 00:11:11,037
There were children as well.

122
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,407
I'm looking for a friend I met back then.

123
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:15,247
Try to tell me in detail.

124
00:11:15,247 --> 00:11:17,977
That way I can tell you who it is.

125
00:11:24,397 --> 00:11:29,077
On a rainy day... I saw him for the first time.

126
00:11:29,077 --> 00:11:31,957
 There was a sun-shower during my first day here. 

127
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:36,927
 I came out because the sound of rain sounded like music. 

128
00:11:36,927 --> 00:11:39,617
 Then, I saw him. 

129
00:11:39,617 --> 00:11:44,277
 He was standing at the edge of the ocean. 

130
00:11:44,847 --> 00:11:47,977
 I thought it would be nice to die. 

131
00:11:47,977 --> 00:11:51,597
 That dying would be better. 

132
00:11:52,697 --> 00:11:54,277
 I was barely 12 years old. 

133
00:11:54,277 --> 00:11:56,407
 Hey, you there! 

134
00:11:57,107 --> 00:11:59,097
 Watch out! 

135
00:12:06,407 --> 00:12:08,087
 But then... 

136
00:12:09,997 --> 00:12:11,987
 I met you. 

137
00:12:30,947 --> 00:12:33,697
 I'm Yeon Seo. Lee Yeon Seo. 

138
00:12:33,697 --> 00:12:35,117
 And you? 

139
00:12:35,117 --> 00:12:37,047
 My name is... 

140
00:12:37,737 --> 00:12:40,637
 Seong Woo. Yoo Seong Woo. 

141
00:12:40,637 --> 00:12:47,137
 Seven, eight, nine, ten. 

142
00:12:47,137 --> 00:12:49,497
 Here I come! 

143
00:12:49,497 --> 00:12:51,767
 Where are you? 

144
00:12:54,087 --> 00:12:56,127
 I saw you! 

145
00:13:06,607 --> 00:13:08,167
 You can see well now, right? 

146
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:12,347
 You keep falling because your eyes are covered like a shaggy dog. 

147
00:13:12,347 --> 00:13:14,107
 Thank you. 

148
00:13:17,437 --> 00:13:20,647
 Is that me? You really suck at drawing. 

149
00:13:20,647 --> 00:13:22,727
 It's not you! 

150
00:13:30,997 --> 00:13:34,957
That's it? You two only played with each other for several days.

151
00:13:36,197 --> 00:13:38,007
What's going on?

152
00:13:38,007 --> 00:13:40,987
She's looking for someone after ten years.

153
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:45,177
A guy named Seong Woo who lived in the house with the blue gate.

154
00:13:45,177 --> 00:13:48,667
Is today a special day? Is this some kind of a treasure hunt?

155
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:52,457
If it has been that long, Seong Woo probably won't remember you.

156
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:57,097
No. As long as he doesn't have amnesia, he'll definitely remember me.

157
00:13:57,097 --> 00:13:59,747
How can you be so confident?

158
00:14:01,447 --> 00:14:04,057
  I don't want to! I said I don't want to!  

159
00:14:04,057 --> 00:14:05,937
 I was told to go to Russia suddenly. 

160
00:14:05,937 --> 00:14:08,297
 I won't go. Never. 

161
00:14:08,297 --> 00:14:11,107
 I don't want to! I won't even do ballet. 

162
00:14:11,107 --> 00:14:13,337
 I hate it all. 

163
00:14:13,337 --> 00:14:15,077
 What would a 12-year-old know? 

164
00:14:15,077 --> 00:14:17,427
 I didn't want to part with my parents, 

165
00:14:17,427 --> 00:14:23,147
 and I didn't want to part with the very first friend I'd made, so I hid. 

166
00:14:27,397 --> 00:14:29,827
  Your nose is running.  

167
00:14:53,487 --> 00:14:56,347
 That's amazing, that you're going to study dancing there (in Russia). 

168
00:14:56,347 --> 00:14:58,657
 Are you listening to what I'm saying? 

169
00:14:58,657 --> 00:15:01,257
 I'm not going. Never. 

170
00:15:01,257 --> 00:15:03,477
 You said you like dancing. 

171
00:15:03,477 --> 00:15:05,847
 You said you wanted to be the best ballerina in the world. 

172
00:15:05,847 --> 00:15:08,447
 If I go there, I can't visit you. 

173
00:15:08,447 --> 00:15:11,397
 You might not see me forever. 

174
00:15:11,397 --> 00:15:13,607
 We can just write letters. 

175
00:15:17,077 --> 00:15:21,267
  How is it you've never seen a rainbow since you were born?  

176
00:15:21,267 --> 00:15:24,617
  I'll show it to you: a rainbow.  

177
00:15:27,907 --> 00:15:36,267
♫  gently flutters my heart  ♫

178
00:15:37,597 --> 00:15:47,497
♫  Like a stranger in empty streets  ♫

179
00:15:49,097 --> 00:15:51,117
 Why are you crying? 

180
00:15:52,257 --> 00:15:54,647
 Are you disappointed? 

181
00:15:58,217 --> 00:16:00,307
 It was pretty. 

182
00:16:01,307 --> 00:16:04,807
 It's the best thing I've ever seen since I was born. 

183
00:16:09,787 --> 00:16:13,017
 Seeing you, and meeting you, 

184
00:16:13,017 --> 00:16:15,567
 made me want to live for the first time. 

185
00:16:16,117 --> 00:16:22,417
 It was beautiful. I wanted to see more beautiful things. 

186
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:25,127
 He understood the words I expressed through my dance. 

187
00:16:25,127 --> 00:16:31,797
 He was the one who taught me how my dance touches other people's hearts. 

188
00:16:41,237 --> 00:16:46,767
 I wanted to become an adult, a strong and powerful adult, 

189
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,917
 to protect her. 

190
00:16:50,917 --> 00:16:54,897
 We must meet again. 

191
00:16:57,947 --> 00:17:00,747
That's right. The house with a blue gate.

192
00:17:00,747 --> 00:17:03,607
The boy with dark but sparkling eyes.

193
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:06,547
That's right. Do you know him? It's Seong Woo, Yoo Seong Woo.

194
00:17:06,547 --> 00:17:09,207
Hasn't that house been empty for more ten years now?

195
00:17:09,207 --> 00:17:11,137
He moved away? Where to?

196
00:17:11,137 --> 00:17:12,987
Do you happen to know his contact information?

197
00:17:12,987 --> 00:17:17,177
I don't know. They disappeared into thin air all of a sudden one day.

198
00:17:17,177 --> 00:17:19,307
Goodness, you're always forgetting.

199
00:17:19,307 --> 00:17:22,637
How many times do I have to tell you, that kid died.

200
00:17:22,637 --> 00:17:25,487
- That kid? Right? 
- Right.

201
00:17:25,487 --> 00:17:27,387
What are you saying?

202
00:17:27,387 --> 00:17:29,537
Why would he be dead?

203
00:17:34,337 --> 00:17:36,157
No.

204
00:17:37,597 --> 00:17:39,477
Why?

205
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,507
Why?

206
00:17:44,927 --> 00:17:46,847
  What's this?  

207
00:17:46,847 --> 00:17:48,257
 I tripped. 

208
00:17:48,257 --> 00:17:51,267
His father physically abused him a lot,

209
00:17:51,267 --> 00:17:54,417
so he jumped into the ocean.

210
00:17:54,417 --> 00:17:57,047
The police came to catch his father later,

211
00:17:57,047 --> 00:18:00,877
but his father took all his belongings and moved out to the mainland.

212
00:18:00,877 --> 00:18:03,497
That's right. Pitiful.

213
00:18:03,497 --> 00:18:04,697
It's not true.

214
00:18:04,697 --> 00:18:06,617
I also wish it wasn't.

215
00:18:06,617 --> 00:18:09,197
That's why I keep on forgetting it.

216
00:18:09,197 --> 00:18:12,097
It was so atrocious.

217
00:18:15,877 --> 00:18:18,477
 This bastard! 

218
00:18:21,197 --> 00:18:23,987
 This bastard! 

219
00:18:24,417 --> 00:18:28,407
 I will show you how to behave! 

220
00:18:42,757 --> 00:18:45,637
 Argh! This bastard! 

221
00:18:45,637 --> 00:18:48,317
 Where did you go?! 

222
00:20:10,827 --> 00:20:15,947
As you instructed, I looked into each dancer's family and finances.

223
00:20:18,637 --> 00:20:22,157
Thank you. As expected, our Chief Park is awesome.

224
00:20:22,157 --> 00:20:23,897
But why did you ask for that so suddenly?

225
00:20:23,897 --> 00:20:27,807
It's a given for me to be interested in the corps as a director.

226
00:20:27,807 --> 00:20:30,677
Each and every vote by the corps is important.

227
00:20:30,677 --> 00:20:33,967
I ought to look out for them and take good care of them, too.

228
00:20:33,967 --> 00:20:37,607
Are you planning on buying the audition votes?

229
00:20:37,607 --> 00:20:42,647
There's a good word like "sponsor." Why do you use such a word?

230
00:20:42,647 --> 00:20:44,567
How scary.

231
00:20:55,867 --> 00:20:58,147
Our Chief Park is doing so much already.

232
00:20:58,147 --> 00:21:00,707
I didn't take care of you well recently.

233
00:21:00,707 --> 00:21:02,057
What is it, Director?

234
00:21:02,057 --> 00:21:06,357
I heard your second child is going to school in the fall. It's been a while since you've seen them, right?

235
00:21:06,357 --> 00:21:10,077
How about going to England to visit your kids?

236
00:21:10,077 --> 00:21:14,387
Three months is enough, right?

237
00:21:14,387 --> 00:21:17,367
Of course, it will be considered a paid-vacation period.

238
00:21:17,367 --> 00:21:22,377
If I go there, will I also disappear into thin air?

239
00:21:22,377 --> 00:21:24,727
Like Moon Woojin from three years ago.

240
00:21:24,727 --> 00:21:27,517
Chief Park! Why is that coming up?

241
00:21:27,517 --> 00:21:30,207
General Director Choi, even a fly has its anger.

242
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:34,227
And a rat bites a cat when it's cornered.

243
00:21:34,227 --> 00:21:35,607
Chief Park.

244
00:21:35,607 --> 00:21:40,717
Don't do anything to me anymore. Seriously.

245
00:21:43,787 --> 00:21:47,227
I mean... What did I do?

246
00:21:47,227 --> 00:21:51,387
Is giving a bonus and paid vacation such a fault?

247
00:22:00,187 --> 00:22:04,577
Why isn't he here? Why did he disappear?

248
00:22:06,797 --> 00:22:10,237
Why aren't you here, Yoo Seong Woo?

249
00:22:22,027 --> 00:22:24,137
  What are you doing here?  

250
00:22:41,867 --> 00:22:46,967
He... died.

251
00:22:47,857 --> 00:22:54,357
After I left... he apparently died.

252
00:22:55,047 --> 00:22:58,567
He didn't even reply to a single letter.

253
00:22:58,567 --> 00:23:01,477
I hated him so much for it.

254
00:23:01,477 --> 00:23:07,137
After that, I had forgotten about him.

255
00:23:08,087 --> 00:23:13,497
He... He, here...

256
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:19,617
It's not your fault.

257
00:23:19,617 --> 00:23:24,207
Why didn't I know? He was without a pair of shoes,

258
00:23:24,207 --> 00:23:27,347
and he was standing there when the waves were coming.

259
00:23:27,347 --> 00:23:30,107
His hair was not cut properly,

260
00:23:30,107 --> 00:23:33,467
and his body was covered with bruises.

261
00:23:33,467 --> 00:23:36,257
It's not your fault.

262
00:23:36,257 --> 00:23:39,337
No. It's my fault.

263
00:23:39,337 --> 00:23:42,897
Those were all signs.

264
00:23:42,897 --> 00:23:46,217
How did I not realize?

265
00:23:47,037 --> 00:23:50,397
He promised me that he would be an adult for sure.

266
00:23:50,397 --> 00:23:55,457
I laughed at him and teased him for it.

267
00:23:55,457 --> 00:24:00,197
I told him growing up was a natural thing for kids and he didn't have to try to be one.

268
00:24:00,197 --> 00:24:04,097
But for him...

269
00:24:37,667 --> 00:24:40,107
Don't blame yourself.

270
00:24:40,107 --> 00:24:44,567
His fate was only up to that point.

271
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:50,597
Fate? That's simple and brutal.

272
00:24:51,287 --> 00:24:54,947
He must have always been scared all his life.

273
00:24:54,947 --> 00:25:01,347
Until the last moment, how frighting must it have been?

274
00:25:01,347 --> 00:25:04,317
I feel like I'm going to go crazy right now.

275
00:25:06,637 --> 00:25:08,347
Fate?

276
00:25:09,457 --> 00:25:15,317
No, he... Seong Woo... that kid,

277
00:25:18,127 --> 00:25:23,917
probably... thought of you at the end.

278
00:25:23,917 --> 00:25:28,697
In the end, up until his last moment.

279
00:25:28,697 --> 00:25:33,387
How do you know that?

280
00:25:36,437 --> 00:25:39,647
I just think it was probably like that.

281
00:25:39,647 --> 00:25:43,867
Because you were probably the one and only good memory he had,

282
00:25:43,867 --> 00:25:48,757
he would have thought of you. Definitely.

283
00:25:49,967 --> 00:25:51,877
Really?

284
00:25:51,877 --> 00:25:56,017
He knows that you are the only person who remembers him.

285
00:25:57,587 --> 00:25:59,957
He's probably really thankful.

286
00:26:28,507 --> 00:26:32,037
Seong Woo, I'm sorry I'm here so late.

287
00:26:32,037 --> 00:26:37,737
I didn't know. I can't even imagine what happened. I'm so...

288
00:26:37,737 --> 00:26:39,877
♫  A constant break  ♫

289
00:26:39,877 --> 00:26:43,437
I'm really sorry.

290
00:26:43,437 --> 00:26:49,607
♫  Our minds belong to theirs who risk  ♫

291

♫  To those who seek  ♫

292
00:26:51,677 --> 00:26:57,297
Why aren't you praying? Try asking God, that you like so much,

293
00:26:57,297 --> 00:27:03,497
why He made a 12-year-old's life so painful.

294
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:10,717
If there really is a god, does He have to be like this to the end?

295
00:27:10,717 --> 00:27:14,397
♫  I don't know if I can anymore  ♫

296
00:27:14,397 --> 00:27:17,337
God couldn't have left him alone like that.

297
00:27:17,337 --> 00:27:21,377
I know, right?

298
00:27:21,377 --> 00:27:26,007
Why was God so harsh on him?

299
