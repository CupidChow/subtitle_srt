1
00:00:00,633 --> 00:00:01,833
Here we are.

2
00:00:01,833 --> 00:00:03,633
     

3
00:00:03,633 --> 00:00:05,233
Sit.

4
00:00:09,633 --> 00:00:12,233
This is really the Prophecy Tree?

5
00:00:12,233 --> 00:00:16,533
Yes. It helps you to decide where to go at the right time.

6
00:00:17,463 --> 00:00:20,743
What nonsense, a game of prophecy at a dead end.

7
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:25,633
It's coming.

8
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:34,933
Is something written on it?

9
00:00:45,633 --> 00:00:46,933
Here.

10
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:56,033
"July 11th, Fantasia Ballet Theatre"?

11
00:00:56,033 --> 00:00:58,233
You're really like a cult leader now.

12
00:00:58,233 --> 00:01:03,133
Can you just do it for me without a prophecy or a sign?

13
00:01:03,133 --> 00:01:05,833
I've never seen an actual performance of yours.

14
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:09,833
I want to see you jumping, twirling, smiling and crying on the stage.

15
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:11,833
I want to see it.

16
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:14,733
Two days will fly by if I practice and do the show.

17
00:01:15,433 --> 00:01:19,733
Wouldn't that be such a waste of time?

18
00:01:20,633 --> 00:01:22,633
Not at all.

19
00:01:22,633 --> 00:01:25,833
But when I think of it, your dance marked our beginning.

20
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:27,433
The rainbow dance.

21
00:01:28,233 --> 00:01:31,433
Your dance will mark our end as well. Perfect.

22
00:01:31,433 --> 00:01:33,633
Don't say that it's the end.

23
00:01:33,633 --> 00:01:36,633
Nothing is over yet. Let's go.

24
00:01:36,633 --> 00:01:40,233
You'll do it, right? Will you perform "Giselle"?

25
00:01:41,133 --> 00:01:43,633
I don't know. I need to think about it.

26
00:01:43,633 --> 00:01:45,933
We are running out of time.

27
00:01:59,233 --> 00:02:01,533
   

28
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:20,413
What are you doing?

29
00:02:22,403 --> 00:02:26,333
Ah, it's nothing. I was writing my diary since it has been a long time.

30
00:02:30,023 --> 00:02:31,923
Don't bother.

31
00:02:32,633 --> 00:02:35,233
I wrote Him so many reports begging Him to turn me into a human,

32
00:02:35,233 --> 00:02:37,633
but He set all my reports on fire.

33
00:02:37,633 --> 00:02:39,433
Wow, really.

34
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:43,233
That guy is... No, God is unbelievable.

35
00:02:43,233 --> 00:02:45,233
He's the most ill-tempered being in the world.

36
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:50,033
If He wasn't going to read it, why did He allow you to write anything? Does He think this is funny?

37
00:02:51,623 --> 00:02:57,033
That's why you don't have to write anything. You don't have to put anything at stake.

38
00:02:57,843 --> 00:03:02,303
What a pity. Since I'll be dancing, I was going to bet on something.

39
00:03:04,743 --> 00:03:07,423
I'm the most confident at dancing.

40
00:03:09,013 --> 00:03:11,643
Are you going to perform "Giselle"?

41
00:03:14,033 --> 00:03:15,703
- Seriously? 
- Yes.

42
00:03:16,433 --> 00:03:20,833
Ah, really? You made a great choice!

43
00:03:22,433 --> 00:03:25,033
It's going to be beautiful. You'll do great.

44
00:03:25,033 --> 00:03:28,133
How are you so amazing?

45
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:50,633
- Ms. Geum hung herself with the blankets. 
- What?

46
00:03:51,633 --> 00:03:53,433
- Call an ambulance! 
-Yes, sir.

47
00:04:13,633 --> 00:04:15,033
It's good to see you all here.

48
00:04:15,033 --> 00:04:18,133
We'll start the rehearsal after warm-up.

49
00:04:37,943 --> 00:04:40,713
You'll finally dance tomorrow.

50
00:04:41,633 --> 00:04:43,233
You're right.

51
00:04:45,633 --> 00:04:48,633
Our last night is nearing.

52
00:04:48,633 --> 00:04:53,033
I thought it would last forever.

53
00:04:55,183 --> 00:04:58,013
You're practically talking like a human.

54
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:00,833
Is that so?

55
00:05:02,033 --> 00:05:06,633
Do you remember getting drunk and ranting at me?

56
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,633
That happened ages ago.

57
00:05:10,633 --> 00:05:15,833
Imagine how upset I must've been when you fired me, to have drunk alcohol when I couldn't even drink.

58
00:05:17,433 --> 00:05:20,433
For me, I think it was from that day.

59
00:05:20,433 --> 00:05:25,633
Ever since the moment you handed me your handkerchief and told me to think of it as you,

60
00:05:26,963 --> 00:05:29,663
I think I'd already started liking you then.

61
00:05:30,433 --> 00:05:32,833
I only danced with you back then because I was drunk.

62
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:37,533
Now that I think of it, I was quite bold to have danced with you.

63
00:05:42,233 --> 00:05:45,033
Let's relieve that moment, just like that night.

64
00:05:48,453 --> 00:05:51,333
Like it's our first time.

65
00:05:54,433 --> 00:06:04,233
♫  Like a stranger in empty streets  ♫

66
00:06:04,233 --> 00:06:11,633
♫  I wander back and forth every day   ♫

67
00:06:12,633 --> 00:06:17,433
♫  After a long waiting  ♫

68
00:06:17,433 --> 00:06:22,833
♫  and emotional suffering,  ♫

69
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:27,633
♫  rain comes down on me quietly  ♫

70
00:06:27,633 --> 00:06:32,233
♫  and its tears make me soaked  ♫

71
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:36,833
♫  Our memories stopped    ♫

72
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:42,433
♫  at the end of the season  ♫

73
00:06:42,433 --> 00:06:45,433
♫  They shine  ♫

74
00:06:45,433 --> 00:06:50,233
♫  in my heart  ♫

75
00:06:50,233 --> 00:06:55,233
♫   brilliantly like a gleaming shining light  ♫

76
00:07:03,633 --> 00:07:07,433
That day we've been waiting for has finally arrived.

77
00:07:10,783 --> 00:07:12,733
Shall we get going, Miss?

78
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,833
I'll be back.

79
00:07:33,593 --> 00:07:35,943
I'll be back, too.

80
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:58,333
   

81
00:08:07,033 --> 00:08:08,933
Excuse us for a second.

82
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:21,833
Thank you.

83
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,433
You look beautiful.

84
00:08:23,433 --> 00:08:27,233
You truly look like Giselle who just woke up from her grave.

85
00:08:27,233 --> 00:08:28,933
I hope you enjoy our performance tonight.

86
00:08:28,933 --> 00:08:33,433
The VIP seats are vacant. The chairman, general director, and associate director are all absent,

87
00:08:33,433 --> 00:08:35,033
so I'll be watching it alone.

88
00:08:35,033 --> 00:08:38,833
It'll be a pleasant environment for you. Our ballet theatre will get back on its feet soon.

89
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:41,033
Thank you for your patience.

90
00:08:41,033 --> 00:08:42,433
I'll be looking forward to it.

91
00:08:42,433 --> 00:08:45,633
I hope you'll make us fall in love with ballet, as you promised.

92
00:08:45,633 --> 00:08:50,033
I'm going to impress both you and God above.

93
00:08:50,033 --> 00:08:51,233
I'm confident.

94
00:08:51,233 --> 00:08:53,833
I thought you would feel down.

95
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:56,833
You're amazing.

96
00:09:00,233 --> 00:09:01,433
I know this face.

97
00:09:01,433 --> 00:09:06,433
Aren't you the secretary who would be present here and there, like Superman?

98
00:09:06,433 --> 00:09:08,333
I'm her husband.

99
00:09:11,633 --> 00:09:13,833
Whose? You mean, hers?

100
00:09:14,633 --> 00:09:16,833
We got married last week.

101
00:09:18,033 --> 00:09:20,133
I'm sure you all already know him,

102
00:09:20,133 --> 00:09:24,833
but let me introduce him since you'll be seeing him often. This is my husband.

103
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:27,233
Good luck for today.

104
00:09:28,433 --> 00:09:30,133
Congratulations!

105
00:09:43,403 --> 00:09:45,433
You all have worked hard.

106
00:09:45,433 --> 00:09:49,233
Before our show, could our prima ballerina say some words?

107
00:09:49,233 --> 00:09:50,033
Ah, it's fine.

108
00:09:50,033 --> 00:09:51,633
Let's huddle.

109
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:14,233
I thought I came second to none in this world.

110
00:10:14,233 --> 00:10:17,633
To be honest, I even sometimes thought

111
00:10:17,633 --> 00:10:22,233
that God loved me too much and gave me everything.

112
00:10:22,233 --> 00:10:25,233
I had no idea that was all delusion and nonsense.

113
00:10:25,233 --> 00:10:27,233
I've been waiting so long for this show,

114
00:10:27,233 --> 00:10:31,433
and I'm truly honored to be a part of this performance with you all.

115
00:10:31,433 --> 00:10:35,853
Today, I'm going to dance with all my might.

116
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,633
Let's make this "Giselle" performance

117
00:10:39,733 --> 00:10:41,563
beautiful.

118
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,633
Fantasia. "Giselle."

119
00:10:44,633 --> 00:10:46,133
 - Fighting! 
- Fighting! 

120
00:10:57,233 --> 00:11:00,033
She is seriously...

121
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,833
the prettiest, isn't she?

122
00:11:04,033 --> 00:11:05,433
You're crazy about her.

123
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:12,433
Sure. Her beauty is enough to make anyone stop breathing. My Miss Lee Yeon Seo.

124
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:17,233
Thank you, Ms. Jeong.

125
00:11:17,233 --> 00:11:19,433
Why all of a sudden?

126
00:11:21,393 --> 00:11:26,093
If Yeon Seo had a guardian angel, it would probably be you.

127
00:11:26,763 --> 00:11:30,203
I hope you can continue to take good care of her.

128
00:11:31,033 --> 00:11:32,733
You're making me cringe.

129
00:11:35,033 --> 00:11:38,433
Be good to her just like how you've been doing so far.

130
00:11:38,433 --> 00:11:42,633
If you make her cry or break her heart, you'll have to deal with me.

131
00:11:44,033 --> 00:11:45,433
Sure.

132
00:12:05,563 --> 00:12:08,553
Do well. I'll be looking forward to your dance.

133
00:12:08,553 --> 00:12:12,973
I heard you helped the police arrest Roo Na.

134
00:12:13,873 --> 00:12:16,743
From where did you hear that?

135
00:12:16,743 --> 00:12:18,633
Are you okay?

136
00:12:21,483 --> 00:12:23,763
It's hard.

137
00:12:23,763 --> 00:12:30,283
But I've to overcome it. Sis, Mom, and I, too, should face proper punishment.

138
00:12:31,413 --> 00:12:33,263
Thank you.

139
00:13:00,903 --> 00:13:05,833
 Watch me. I'll show you the most beautiful "Giselle" in the world. 

140
00:13:19,213 --> 00:13:21,223
Over here!

141
00:13:35,393 --> 00:13:40,513
 Fantasia's 2019 "Giselle" will start shortly. 

142
00:13:40,513 --> 00:13:44,393
 Please take your seats now. 

143
00:13:49,223 --> 00:13:50,333
Excuse me.

144
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:51,983
I'm in the stage management team.

145
00:13:51,983 --> 00:13:53,193
You're late.

146
00:13:53,193 --> 00:13:54,893
I'm sorry.

147
00:15:21,043 --> 00:15:22,963
What happened? Why are you here, Sis?

148
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:25,053
Slow down, Ni Na.

149
00:15:25,053 --> 00:15:27,263
Did you run away?

150
00:15:27,263 --> 00:15:28,523
You could say that.

151
00:15:28,523 --> 00:15:30,493
Why? What are you planning to do now?

152
00:15:30,493 --> 00:15:33,573
It wounded my pride.

153
00:15:33,573 --> 00:15:35,153
It's all because of one person.

154
00:15:35,153 --> 00:15:39,753
I'm in this big mess because of that person. I must return the favor.

155
00:15:40,313 --> 00:15:41,993
Who?

156
00:15:41,993 --> 00:15:43,423
Yeon Seo?

157
00:15:43,423 --> 00:15:47,783
Are you going after her again? I told you that I don't want you to do this for me!

158
00:15:50,273 --> 00:15:53,423
It's not Yeon Seo. It's that guy.

159
00:15:53,423 --> 00:15:55,773
I realized this recently.

160
00:15:57,133 --> 00:16:02,983
Losing the thing you cherish the most can enrage and drive you crazy.

161
00:16:02,983 --> 00:16:06,523
Yeon Seo should also feel what I felt.

162
00:16:06,523 --> 00:16:11,523
Stop it now, Sis. Please turn yourself in!

163
00:16:11,523 --> 00:16:13,323
Listen carefully, Ni Na.

164
00:16:13,323 --> 00:16:17,613
Tomorrow, you'll be performing Giselle.

165
00:16:19,413 --> 00:16:22,153
If you don't want to, report me to the police again.

166
00:18:49,013 --> 00:18:50,603


167
00:18:51,223 --> 00:18:54,203
Geum Roo Na is here in Fantasia right now?

168
00:18:54,773 --> 00:18:58,383
I already called the police. They're on their way here.

169
00:18:58,383 --> 00:18:59,833
Thank you, Ms. Ni Na.

170
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,613
But...

171
00:19:02,163 --> 00:19:04,903
something about her was strange.

172
00:19:04,903 --> 00:19:09,473
She said she wasn't after Yeon Seo, but you.

173
00:19:11,983 --> 00:19:13,893
Be careful.

174
00:19:29,363 --> 00:19:34,913
- Ni Na. Did something happen? Why are you so nervous? 
- Huh?

175
00:19:37,753 --> 00:19:41,633
 It's a relief she isn't after Yeon Seo but me. 

176
00:19:41,633 --> 00:19:44,733
 Ni Na, please don't say anything to Yeon Seo. 

177
00:19:44,733 --> 00:19:46,793
 - Still— 
- I'll catch her. 

178
00:19:46,793 --> 00:19:48,663
 I'll handle it quietly. 

179
00:19:48,663 --> 00:19:51,603
 Help Yeon Seo focus only on her performance. 

180
00:19:52,313 --> 00:19:54,093
 I'm asking this of you. 

181
00:19:55,923 --> 00:19:59,603
Nothing. It's nothing.

182
00:20:11,463 --> 00:20:13,163
Yeon Seo.

183
00:20:15,453 --> 00:20:17,783
Did you see the show?

184
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,733
How was it?

185
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:22,373
It was the best.

186
00:20:22,373 --> 00:20:25,303
Act Two will be even better. Watch carefully.

187
00:20:25,303 --> 00:20:26,843
Okay.

188
00:20:28,873 --> 00:20:31,353
Dan, actually yesterday...

189
00:20:32,713 --> 00:20:34,633
I wrote a report.

190
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:37,673
   

191
00:20:49,753 --> 00:20:53,353
But it didn't disappear even after I finished writing. I guess He's going to grant my prayers.

192
00:20:53,353 --> 00:20:57,393
- Hey, why on earth— 
- Watch me, Dan. I'll never give up on you.

193
00:20:57,393 --> 00:20:59,833
I'll pull off this performance no matter what,

194
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:03,883
and I'm going to protect you.

195
00:21:05,623 --> 00:21:07,933
 The performance will resume shorty.  

196
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,853
- I have to go get ready.
  - Please return to your seats. 

197
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:12,683
Yeon Seo,

198
00:21:14,043 --> 00:21:15,813
I love you.

199
00:21:17,733 --> 00:21:19,543
Me too.

200
00:21:37,283 --> 00:21:39,823
Yes. Where are you?

201
00:22:02,073 --> 00:22:03,813
Yes.

202
00:22:03,813 --> 00:22:06,843
I'll look for her until you get here.

203
00:22:50,323 --> 00:22:51,673
Where is Yeon Seo?

204
00:22:51,673 --> 00:22:54,503
I don't know. Director Ji, we're about to begin.

205
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:56,903
Everyone, let's go.

206
00:23:02,463 --> 00:23:04,593
Let's go.

207
00:23:04,593 --> 00:23:06,403
Me?

208
00:24:31,073 --> 00:24:34,873
Everything is over. Just give up.

209
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:37,133
It isn't.

210
00:24:37,133 --> 00:24:41,993
I told you nice ones always lose because they're slow.

211
00:24:47,783 --> 00:24:51,623
Here's your chance to kill me.

212
00:25:01,153 --> 00:25:05,723
Isn't that great? It can be self-defense or accidental death.

213
00:25:05,723 --> 00:25:11,213
This is enough to let you live on in Korea after killing a person.

214
00:25:22,123 --> 00:25:24,773
That's right. Kill me.

215
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:27,613
That's the only way this torment can end.

216
00:25:27,613 --> 00:25:31,173
If you don't kill me, I'll go after Yeon Seo until the end.

217
00:25:31,173 --> 00:25:33,063
Can I do that?

218
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,333
Where did you go?

219
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:10,893
I'm late.

220
00:26:10,893 --> 00:26:12,713
You covered for me really well. Thank you.

221
00:26:12,713 --> 00:26:14,803
Hurry up and go on the stage.

222
00:26:14,803 --> 00:26:16,763
Ni Na,

223
00:26:18,483 --> 00:26:22,053
can you fill in for me tomorrow?

224
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,213
Please do that for me.

225
00:26:34,723 --> 00:26:36,823
 Please save me. 

226
00:26:39,963 --> 00:26:43,013
 Don't kill me. 

227
00:26:45,363 --> 00:26:47,383
 Please. 

228
00:26:59,803 --> 00:27:01,903
Live.

229
00:27:01,903 --> 00:27:04,823
Live and pay for your sins.

230
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:19,673
It was supposed to be you.

231
00:27:22,393 --> 00:27:24,653
What do you mean?

232
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:30,673
 I'll look for her. 

233
00:27:39,503 --> 00:27:41,453
 Hurry up and come. 

234
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:48,873
 You... Why are you here? 

235
00:27:48,873 --> 00:27:51,833
 You can't touch Dan. Never. 

236
00:27:53,123 --> 00:27:55,273
 Please, 

237
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:59,203
 please stop all this! 

238
00:28:05,543 --> 00:28:08,413
My gift, I hope you like it.

239
00:28:10,083 --> 00:28:12,053
Let's go.

240
00:29:02,723 --> 00:29:05,823
 I must finish this dance. 

241
00:29:05,823 --> 00:29:07,803
 Please. 

242
00:29:08,753 --> 00:29:10,513
 This is it. 

243
00:29:10,513 --> 00:29:15,683
 I... can save you. 

244
00:30:01,953 --> 00:30:03,563
 Did You see? 

245
00:30:03,563 --> 00:30:06,743
 No matter how hard I think, I can't give up. 

246
00:30:08,793 --> 00:30:15,033
 If my dance moved Your heart, then please grant me just one wish. 

247
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:19,933
 Please let Dan live. 

248
00:30:52,553 --> 00:30:55,173
 Even if we can't be together, 

249
00:30:56,093 --> 00:31:01,743
 even if my heart breaks, even if I can't see him again, 

250
00:31:03,973 --> 00:31:06,503
 I just want him to be alive.
