1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:04,060
Where should we go?

2
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:07,600
Mountain, field, or beach: wherever you want to go.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,370
Somewhere very special.

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:11,930
What?

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,050
Where to? Where?

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:25,550


7
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,060
How is this place special? We've been here hundreds of times.

8
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:31,520
This is the first place you and I met. The time we met again was here.

9
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,170
We also cried here, too.

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,970
To others, this place might be a regular park, but for us, this place has history and is meaningful.

11
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,130
Now let's go on a date.

12
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:55,560
It looks so delicious.

13
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,240
You made it?

14
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,830
♫  I like where we are heading now  ♫

15
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,170
♫  These little feelings I suppose  ♫

16
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,140
♫  are just a little  ♫

17
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,990
♫  You  ♫

18
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,910
♫  In a minute I'll be there to tell you how it is  ♫

19
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,810
♫  And I'm crazy over  ♫

20
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,080
♫  You  ♫

21
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:30,870
♫  You can tell me anything so that can make me stay  ♫

22
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,850
♫  Oh, I'm in love with  ♫

23
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:41,300
♫   Another day, another life, passes by just like mine   ♫  

24
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,680
♫   It's not complicated   ♫  

25
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,460
Why aren't you coming to practice? I know it may be hard—

26
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,120
♫   Another mind, another soul   ♫  

27
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,680
   

28
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,330
Thank you for everything so far.

29
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:58,910
Ni Na, please don't be like this.

30
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,920
I know you may be uncomfortable, but—

31
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,900
Am I laughable?

32
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:07,810
That day, when you called me to my mom's office, you knew everything. Right?

33
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,880
 Director Ji called me. 

34
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,180
 He said he had something to tell me. 

35
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,220
 Ni Na, there's something you need to know. 

36
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,700
What my mom and sister did,

37
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:20,260
you used me to threaten them.

38
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:24,380
At that time, I had no choice but to do that.

39
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,640
I had to use the one card that those two treasured the most—

40
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:33,310
You said I danced well. You said it was the Giselle you dreamed of.

41
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,870
I like you, Director Ji.

42
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,950
Do I look stupid to you?

43
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:40,860
I'm sorry. I didn't think lightly of this.

44
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,370
I wished you didn't know about this to the end.

45
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,020
Don't be ridiculous.

46
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:52,290
You've never once thought of me sincerely.

47
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:58,690
I regret trying so hard to be recognized by you.

48
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:02,520
You should have known about my feelings and used them

49
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,550
just as much as you are obsessed with Yeon Seo,

50
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,050
even though you're not worth enough to do that.

51
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,550
You're pretty.

52
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:46,070
You shine so brightly.

53
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,620
Dan, there's a favor I want to ask you.

54
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,830
What is it? I'll do anything.

55
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:05,150
Would you really do anything for me?

56
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,700
Of course. Just say it.

57
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:14,430
I looked into ways of becoming human.

58
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:21,520
There are three things you need to do.

59
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,190
First, you need to jump off of a tall building.

60
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,620
When I was watching this movie,

61
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:31,390
the angel jumped off a tower without any wings and became human.

62
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:36,260
Would we need to jump off around the 20th floor?

63
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,510
And what else?

64
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,030
In order to live again, you need death. Right?

65
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,380
Like how you became Kim Dan from Seong Woo.

66
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,620
Let's drown in the ocean.

67
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,410
Are you serious?

68
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:52,660
If not, I think there's a way where you hold your breath until your heart stops.

69
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,120
I've tried drowning in the ocean and a river.

70
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,320
I was suffocating, but nothing had happened.

71
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,930
When it rains, my wings appear no matter what.

72
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,080
This isn't it.

73
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,720
I see.

74
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,210
I knew it.

75
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,310
You knew that already—

76
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,400
I have no idea how to help you become human,

77
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:18,290
but I know a way you and I can be together.

78
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,350
What is it?

79
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,800
Hold on. Why are we here?

80
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,700
I thought about it,

81
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:36,110
where the perfect place would be. Even though I don't believe in God, he's a father figure to you.

82
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:48,210
Marry me, Dan.

83
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:53,080
Dan! Kim Dan!

84
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,340
I'll pretend I didn't hear it.

85
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,350
Why? Why won't it work?

86
00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:00,230
You said you love me. I love you, too!

87
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:07,180
I love you. I said I love you.

88
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:11,150
What kind of person would be so shameless as to marry someone when he's expected to die soon!

89
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,510
What does that have to do with anything?

90
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:15,300
Get your head together, Yeon Seo! You don't know what will happen to me, but marriage—

91
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,070
Why do you keep thinking of disappearing?

92
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,180
You just do your best to be by my side.

93
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:22,750
Just use any and all methods to become a human.

94
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,440
- Let's get married.
 - No, we can't.

95
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,280
- Let's do it.
 - I'm not going to.

96
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,950
Well, I'm going to do it.

97
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:37,760
If God made us meet, He should take responsibility for it. Don't you think?

98
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:00,290
Dan! Are you okay?

99
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,120
Are you okay?

100
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,410
Oh, gosh. What do we do?

101
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:05,680
Are you okay?

102
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,850
Yes, I'm okay.

103
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,620
Yeon Seo, let's go.

104
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,530
They can't see.

105
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,930
He looks really hurt.

106
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,020
Oh, look at that! His left arm!

107
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,450
It's okay. I covered it.

108
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,160
I'm okay. I'll be just fine.

109
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,670
Dan!

110
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,480
Where are we?

111
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,410
Are you conscious? We're in the emergency room.

112
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,510
My head hurts.

113
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:53,770
Yeon Seo, why does my head hurt?

114
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:56,460
You wouldn't stop bleeding.

115
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,810
I saw it.

116
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:04,180
While you were getting your injury treated, it didn't heal.

117
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,490
Your injuries used to heal in five seconds.

118
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,630
No way...

119
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,560
No way...

120
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,170
This easily?

121
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:47,590
Did you do something? What did you do that made you a human?

122
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,290
   

123
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:56,030
I guess my feelings were accepted.

124
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,180
Maybe He acknowledged my sincerity.

125
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,020
But it's weird.

126
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:03,600
Is it that easy for an angel to become human?

127
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:10,510
God is not one to ignore an earnest prayer, so maybe He granted my wish?

128
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,630
I hope that is true.

129
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,490
Oh yeah, rain. When it rains, you can check.

130
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,160
If your wings appear, you're an angel.

131
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:25,890
If not, you became human. Right?

132
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:33,450
♫   One, two, a one, two, three, four ♫ 

133
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,490
     

134
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:37,470
It's clear again.

135
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,450
- Dan. 
 - What?

136
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:44,100
Since the day is clear, do you want to get married?

137
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,640
What?

138
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,870
Dan, you're thankful. Right?

139
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,420
Yeah, I'm happy.

140
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:53,640
Since you're happy, shall we get married?

141
00:09:54,930 --> 00:10:01,680
Look at the moon. It's so bright. It'll probably be clear tomorrow, too.

142
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,180
People in the old days prayed for rain with this desperation.

143
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:14,600
I keep imagining it, about what will happen when it rains.

144
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,650
And?

145
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:20,650
I kind of wish it would never come.

146
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:24,240
Just like this,

147
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:29,830
I wish we could live happily together.

148
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,750
But we have to check.

149
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,440
The end?

150
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,870
Don't say the word "end."

151
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,920
Sorry.

152
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,010
Don't say you're sorry either.

153
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,690
Even if you really

154
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:52,980
didn't become human,

155
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:56,040
don't ever say you're sorry to me.

156
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,850
Got it?

157
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:11,570
It's supposed to be clear tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.

158
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,620
 Please listen to my prayer. 

159
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:43,240
 Please just grant me this one and only thing, Kim Dan. 

160
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,280
Did they come out?

161
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,420
They didn't!

162
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,100
You really became human!

163
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,800
Thank you! Seriously, thank you!

164
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,260
It's the first time my prayer was granted!

165
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,220
Let me have a look.

166
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,210
You really must be a human.

167
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:37,360
Now you're going to stay with me until I die, right?

168
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:49,230
♫   Because of you, you ♫ 

169
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:54,840
♫   If you leave me I’m broken in my heart ♫ 

170
00:12:54,840 --> 00:13:02,390
♫   Because of you, you ♫ 

171
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,200
♫   Always ♫ 

172
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:09,810
♫   Always stay by my side ♫ 

173
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:12,880
♫   I will always protect you ♫ 

174
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:18,070
 Something that I could never have imagined occurred. 

175
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:24,120
 If there could be a single miracle in my life, 

176
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,000
 it would be love. 

177
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:32,520
♫   You’re my one and only love, it’s you ♫ 

178
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:40,080
♫   Because of you, you ♫ 

179
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,970
♫   Always ♫ 

180
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:47,600
♫   Always stay by my side ♫ 

181
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,870
♫   I will always protect you   ♫  

182
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:57,390
♫   I will always love you, to you ♫ 

183
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:46,890
What happened? Did I not become human?

184
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:49,850
Yesterday, it even rained and my wings didn't come out.

185
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:51,740
Look at this. There's a wound.

186
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:55,950
The wound isn't even healing because I'm human.

187
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:58,960
You fool.

188
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,980
This is a human body, isn't it? I've even got human bones, skin, and a heart.

189
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,790
So how come things are passing through it? Why?

190
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:08,390
Have you checked your handkerchief?

191
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:11,800
When an angel has completed his mission and reached the end of his existence,

192
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,150
whether you become a human or dissipate,

193
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:18,750
the handkerchief will become black at the end of an angel.

194
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:24,620
You're still an angel and will ultimately never be able to become human.

195
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,140
That's the answer He's given you. There's only one way to become one.

196
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:32,780
However, you will live through the same hell Ji Kang Woo went through.

197
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,010
I won't use that method.

198
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:40,860
I don't even know what to do and I don't want to know.

199
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:46,220
In a world without Yeon Seo, I don't want to be an angel or a human.

200
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:51,280
Why are you going that far?

201
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,750
I didn't go there.

202
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:59,150
My heart came this far without me knowing.

203
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:04,380
Then, why is my body like this?

204
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:09,130
If it's not teasing me, why are the wings not coming out and the wound not healing?

205
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:13,190
The valid period of your body is determined by your mission.

206
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,760
It's a sign.

207
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:19,930
It's an indication that your time is up.

208
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,950
  You really became human.  

209
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:46,500
  Now you're going to stay with me until I die, right?  

210
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:52,810
♫   The lives we play behind the mask ♫ 

211
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:58,880
♫   A constant rain of pain ♫ 

212
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:05,160
♫   Our minds belong to those who ask ♫ 

213
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:11,800
♫   To those who seek to change ♫ 

214
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:20,000
♫   I can say anything that I want, when I want ♫ 

215
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,250
♫   I believe in things that I see, I pray ♫ 

216
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:32,470
♫   I don't know if I can anymore, so watch me break ♫ 

217
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:39,360
      
♫  I can see everything torn away from me  ♫

218
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,550
Did you meet your senior?

219
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:47,580
Yes. You said you have a rehearsal, right?

220
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:52,930
It's not official. We are just checking the formations and lighting.

221
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,920
What should I do?

222
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,280
I think I'm going to be a little late.

223
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,670
You must have a lot to talk about with your senior.

224
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:06,820
I'll be fine. I can just go with Ms. Jeong.

225
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,590
Sorry.

226
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,360
I told you not to say that.

227
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,070
 Sorry. 

228
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:21,620
♫   That was a while ago ♫ 

229
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:25,820
I'll just see you later this afternoon. Come back safely.

230
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:34,810
♫   That was a while ago ♫ 

231
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:44,300
     

232
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:50,900
What can I get for you?

233
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,070
Do you have canola flowers?

234
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,230
It's the end of the season for that.

235
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:00,330
We happen to have one. The last bunch.

236
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,030
I'll take it.

237
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:12,880
You must be giving these to your girlfriend.

238
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,100
Girlfriend...

239
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:24,400
Yes. I'm giving them to someone I really, really love.

240
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,770
You must like her a lot.

241
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:29,130
But why specifically canola flowers?

242
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:32,570
Men usually get roses.

243
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,870
We made a promise to go see them together next spring,

244
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,750
but I think

245
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,450
that might be hard to do.

246
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,230
You said its been three years, right?

247
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:13,150
Since you worked on Fantasia's lighting team.

248
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,170
Yes.

249
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,170
What are you doing?

250
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,990
Why don't you answer your calls?

251
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,620
How could I answer your calls?

252
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,730
Don't run away.

253
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:11,440
How could I keep dancing at Fantasia?

254
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,150
You didn't know.

255
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,040
No.

256
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:19,330
There's a chance I might have known.

257
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:22,420
And I could have wished for it.

258
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:25,190
That I would die?

259
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:31,350
Just thinking about it isn't a sin, even though we could never become friends.

260
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:35,190
My family hurt you.

261
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:38,880
They killed Mr. Seung Hwan.

262
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,470
How could I hold my head up and come here—

263
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:43,180
Your Giselle was great.

264
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:49,380
It was different from mine, but it was undeniably fantastic.

265
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:55,620
I want to be teamed up with a talented ballerina.

266
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,970
Also, don't run away.

267
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:02,330
Stay and be in pain looking at my face.

268
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:05,460
Think of that as your punishment.

269
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,160
For a magnificent effect,

270
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,980
fix it on the top right.

271
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,330
And set up the fin light on the center.

272
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:32,950
And last of all, for the main light, we secured it up there.

273
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,480
Okay.

274
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,500
The console is ready, right?

275
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:40,010
Let's start checking the space in ten minutes.

276
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:18,400
You said you couldn't come. You even brought flowers.

277
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,290
These are canola flowers.

278
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:27,710
It's not even an official show and you brought me flowers.

279
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:31,810
When I first saw you, I wanted to give you these.

280
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:32,860
When?

281
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:35,990
At the 20th Anniversary Cultural Foundation event.

282
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:38,530
You were there at that time?

283
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:41,590
I saw your dance.

284
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,830
That day you were the most beautiful so I wanted to give you the flowers.

285
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,210
So let's get married.

286
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:04,160
Again? I told you no.

287
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,820
 We're starting rehearsal! 

288
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:09,530
Just a simple and small one between us.

289
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,680
I'm going to marry you.

290
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,170
I'm going to use this as a bouquet, so keep it safe.

291
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:20,860
Got it? I'm going back inside.

292
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:36,740
What a stubborn girl.

293
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:41,230
Kim Dan, you dummy.

294
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:23,430
  Sorry.  

295
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:27,060
  I told you not to say that.  

296
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:31,330
  Sorry.  

297
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:38,950
  I'll just see you later this afternoon. Come back safely.  

298
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,750
  I won't cry.  

299
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,520
 Let's see who wins. 

300
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,750
 I'm going to do everything I want with Kim Dan. 

301
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,420
Wind?

302
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,590
Where's it coming from?

303
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:35,600
Don't say anything.

304
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:42,430
It's death.

305
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:45,630
I didn't hear you.

306
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:48,900
You know everything.

307
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,110
Don't pretend you don't.

308
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:02,020
I won't become human. I'll give up my greed.

309
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,890
I'll just dissipate. I'll disappear.

310
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:07,620
I have already made up my mind.

311
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,340
That night,

312
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:14,250
you weren't the only one given a final chance.

313
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:25,870
That human was supposed to die.

314
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:29,620
That was her fate.

315
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:32,600
How is that possible?

316
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:37,850
It was fate for us to meet again.

317
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:40,390
Her fate was to be killed by the wicked.

318
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:43,390
Sometimes someone is born with that fate.

319
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,780
No. No.

320
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:52,420
She only prolonged the inevitable. No matter how much you try to resist it,

321
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:55,070
prophecies will come to fruition

322
00:28:55,070 --> 00:29:00,380
and fate always comes true.

323
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:50,750


324
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:56,940
 ♫ The little things you do ♫ 

325
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,030
 ♫ I've seen them in my dreams ♫ 

326
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,950
Let's do it.

327
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:11,760
 ♫ Now a part of me ♫ 

328
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,590
Please...

329
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:19,220
marry me, Lee Yeon Seo.

330
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:26,740
 ♫ And when I close my eyes ♫ 

331
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:34,350
♫  I feel your breath so near  ♫

332
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:41,270
 ♫ Stay this way for good ♫ 

333
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:45,160
 ♫ In this little dream ♫ 

334
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,630
 ♫ With you ♫ 

335
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:55,820
 ♫ Woo Woo Just Stay ♫ 

336
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:59,610
♫  Stay with me, my friend  ♫

337
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:04,000

338
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:10,630
 ♫ Woo Woo I’ll Stay ♫ 

339
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:14,550
 ♫ Stay with me this way ♫ 

340
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,180
 ♫ Just you ♫ 

341
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,400
 ♫ And I ♫ 

342
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:29,020
     

343
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,350
 I want to marry Miss. 

344
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:32,460
 I am lacking in many ways but if you can give us your blessing. 

345
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,270
 Dream on, punk! 

346
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,120
 Absolutely not! 

347
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,380
 Miss, about getting married— 

348
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,640
 How do you feel about officiating? 

349
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,390
 Me? 

350
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:43,630
 No, I'm going to change that. 

351
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:47,660
 I'm... going to save Dan.
