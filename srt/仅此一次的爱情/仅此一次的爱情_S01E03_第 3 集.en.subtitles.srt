1
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,097
Are you all right?

2
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:00,727
One moment.

3
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,087
What was that sound?

4
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,394
Are you feeling ill?

5
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:46,981
Your face...

6
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:51,402
is red.

7
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:53,988
Are you feverish?

8
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:05,834
What

9
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:07,836
are these?

10
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:12,674
What are these?

11
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:17,595
Wings...

12
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:20,932
Are you...

13
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,480
Are you really...

14
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:34,237
Don't come near me.

15
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:36,739
You'll get hurt.

16
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,661
I really can't believe this.

17
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,168
I can explain.

18
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,713
-Don't be alarmed.
-Forget it.

19
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,007
There's no pervert who can
explain why he is a pervert.

20
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,343
-What?
-You ignored my call and the pager.

21
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,138
It's because you had these things on.

22
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:02,515
I didn't put on anything...

23
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,440
Please excuse me, then.

24
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,361
Take these off right now.

25
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,447
Take these off.

26
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,574
Take these off while I'm watching, now.

27
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,742
Let me go!

28
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,077
Take these off!

29
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,579
What are you doing?

30
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:26,080
Let me go!

31
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,291
Hey. I said, take it off!

32
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,336
I can only take it off if you let me go!

33
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,379
I can only take it off if you stay still.

34
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,715
It's unsightly and disgusting.
I'm going to burn it.

35
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,761
"Unsightly"? Hey, how could you say that?

36
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:42,430
Have you ever seen such big, brilliant,
and beautiful wings?

37
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:43,389
Did you just

38
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:45,767
talk rudely to me?

39
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,018
If you can, then I can.

40
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:49,229
Wake up. I hired you.

41
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:53,274
You know nothing else except employing,
contracts, and hierarchies.

42
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,860
You're too ignorant to notice
what's beautiful.

43
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,820
-Are you done talking?
-No, not yet!

44
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,240
These wings don't deserve
to be called disgusting

45
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,242
by someone who is dead inside,
you noisy gong!

46
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,452
You're the one who's unsightly!

47
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,409
Right.

48
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:48,454
Angels, monsters, and perverts...

49
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:50,957
To humans, they are all the same.

50
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,493
Lee Yeon-seo!

51
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:29,412
Gosh!

52
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:32,123
Hold on!

53
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,250
Hey! Call the police!

54
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,585
Gosh. Ms. Lee.

55
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,754
It was him! Call the police!

56
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,047
What are you talking about?

57
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,631
Ms. Lee, I just came--

58
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,925
-Gosh! Hurry up!
-Gosh.

59
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:45,470
-Hey!
-What?

60
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:46,596
You're not going to get down?

61
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,432
You little punk.

62
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:53,644
Tell me.

63
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,188
Who are you?

64
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,315
I'm Ji Kang-woo, okay?

65
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,026
I'm the Artistic Director of Fantasia.

66
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:01,778
It's me, Ji Kang-woo.

67
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,530
You're Ji Kang-woo

68
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,784
from the ballet theater in New York City?

69
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,831
JI KANG-WOO
ARTISTIC DIRECTOR OF FANTASIA

70
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:20,838
You're not going to report this?

71
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,465
I'll take care of it.

72
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,008
You may go.

73
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:25,968
Then let me do it.

74
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,178
Don't taint the crime scene.

75
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:28,679
Excuse me, Mr. Ji Kang-woo.

76
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:29,931
This is my house.

77
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,766
I have full authority over
what goes on here.

78
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,144
What are you afraid of?

79
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,563
I'm not afraid.
I just don't want to be bothered.

80
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:40,441
People around me
are eager to talk about me.

81
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,736
Anyway, just leave.

82
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,029
Let me help you.

83
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:45,947
Leaving

84
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,282
when I tell you to

85
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:49,992
is how you can help me.

86
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:52,286
Ms. Lee.

87
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,247
Are you deaf?

88
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,670
She wants you to leave.

89
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,759
If you were mistaken, you should apologize

90
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,970
and ask for forgiveness, okay?

91
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:09,971
Mr. Secretary.

92
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,849
You were standing there,
looking so suspicious.

93
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,393
Still, that doesn't give you the right
to attack me like that.

94
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:16,352
Well...

95
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:20,481
You collapsed like a paper doll,
so I was flustered, indeed.

96
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:23,151
I had no idea

97
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,862
you'd attack me out of the blue.

98
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,947
I'm a man of common sense, you see.

99
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:32,076
Are you telling me you'd have won
if you had been prepared for it?

100
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,080
Were you with him

101
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,624
when the window broke?

102
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,295
No.

103
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:45,923
-But--
-To break that window,

104
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,758
you'd have to be out in the garden.

105
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:48,968
It's not an outsider's doing.

106
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:54,432
Hey.

107
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:56,976
You were out there, weren't you?

108
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,939
Who do you think

109
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:03,733
is the most suspicious?

110
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,242
You fool.
How dare you accuse me of such a crime!

111
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,786
You must be upset over what happened.
Let's fight fair and square.

112
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,829
Come at me.

113
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,165
-You little--
-Enough.

114
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,085
Don't make me repeat myself again.

115
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:24,337
Leave.

116
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,672
And I'm warning you.

117
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,008
You better not babble about what happened

118
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:30,635
to the people at Fantasia.

119
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,726
Forget it. You're noisy.

120
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,107
The door

121
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,110
-is over there.
-I know.

122
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,628
What are you afraid of?

123
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,020
Are you all right?

124
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,111
Phony religious cult...

125
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,405
He's a pervert and a lunatic.

126
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:35,658
Gosh, that hurts.

127
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:06,731
Why are you standing here?

128
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,774
Why are you coming out?

129
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:17,867
Drink this. It's chamomile tea.

130
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,790
I know you drink this
when you can't sleep.

131
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:25,833
I read it in the documents.

132
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,211
You were startled back there.

133
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:31,631
Who was?

134
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,424
Me? No, I wasn't.

135
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:44,101
Why do humans lie?

136
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,855
"I'm afraid. I'm nervous. I need you."

137
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,733
Saying such things won't do you any harm.

138
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:55,863
Drink this and sleep.

139
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,378
I'll be here until morning.

140
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,463
Just in case.

141
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:16,467
Don't overreact.

142
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:23,891
Apply this.

143
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,768
Don't use your wound as an excuse
to take a day off.

144
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,737
Gosh. That noisy gong.

145
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,672
I'd like some information
about her new secretary.

146
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,591
His past, present, and work history.

147
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:39,675
Everything.

148
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,805
What's going on in that house?

149
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,564
Hello.

150
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,691
Do you live in this neighborhood?

151
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,152
What a coincidence.

152
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:44,740
There's a great dumpling joint nearby,
so I came here to buy dumplings.

153
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,159
Yet, I don't see anything in your hands.

154
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,953
I was on my way to buy them now.

155
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,788
Okay then. Bye.

156
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:52,748
Bye.

157
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,296
Ni-na.

158
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:03,926
Did you have dinner?

159
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:13,435
Why did you wait for me?

160
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,397
I told you that was a coincidence.

161
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,399
Is it that hard for you to trust people?

162
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,234
There are no dumpling joints nearby.

163
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,656
People

164
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,867
are not to be trusted that easily.

165
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:29,869
Why not?

166
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,371
Because they are weak.

167
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:36,125
Valuable people die too quickly.

168
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,670
Those selfish liars live very long lives.

169
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:40,921
They betray

170
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:42,464
and commit evil deeds.

171
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:44,800
I don't trust anyone.

172
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:49,179
Some people deceive and betray others,

173
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,725
but I'm sure at least 1 person out of 100
won't do that.

174
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,769
I want to trust people recklessly
and continue to do so.

175
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,147
And I also want

176
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,232
to be someone you can trust.

177
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:03,736
You're naive.

178
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:05,863
Yeon-seo wasn't.

179
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,617
Have you met Yeon-seo?

180
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,040
That's great.

181
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:20,127
The three of us should meet together.
Yeon-seo will start practicing soon.

182
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,420
We should help her a lot.

183
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,256
You don't need to lie to me.

184
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,967
I'm sick of hypocrisy and pretense.

185
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,011
Why do you assume
that I wasn't being sincere?

186
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,513
When I went to Russia to study abroad,

187
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,974
I couldn't wait to wake up in the morning

188
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:37,394
because I could see Yeon-seo's dance.

189
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:41,023
She was the living proof
that the deity existed.

190
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,525
The deity molded her body
with the utmost care.

191
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,111
He gave her a lot of talents.

192
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,114
My heart was full.

193
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,284
If Yeon-seo can dance like before,

194
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:55,913
I'm ready to become her understudy again.

195
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,958
That's how I truly feel.

196
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,876
Then why did you come to me?

197
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,087
I thought you came to complain

198
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,672
about not being the lead.

199
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,632
I told you it was a coincidence.

200
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,093
I need to use the restroom.

201
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,328
What are you doing?

202
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,415
If you keep doing this...

203
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,214
You can't...

204
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:49,591
Luckily,

205
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,635
your salivary gland isn't swollen yet.

206
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,515
Keum Ni-na.

207
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:58,767
You just threw up, didn't you?

208
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,485
It was indigestion.

209
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,030
It was just this once. I would never...

210
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,240
You said you wanted

211
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,200
to become a ballerina I could trust.

212
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:17,619
You eat and throw up.

213
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:18,996
And you overeat again.

214
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,415
I've seen many ballerinas
whose careers were over

215
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:22,750
because of anorexia.

216
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,168
I'm sorry.

217
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:28,005
Please don't tell my family.
Especially my sister.

218
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:30,674
She'll blame herself and be really upset.

219
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,510
It's all my fault,
so you can be angry at me.

220
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:36,055
You should care about yourself first.

221
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,933
Should I tell you
how to become a good ballerina?

222
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,275
Be selfish.

223
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,569
Put yourself first

224
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,115
before anyone else.

225
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,309
Is he sleeping?

226
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:32,694
Ms. Lee.

227
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,157
You're up, right?

228
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:39,576
Can you tell me again

229
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,870
what you told me on the phone earlier?

230
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,747
You saw the living room
on your way up here.

231
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,207
That's why I'm asking.

232
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,375
Last night,

233
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,336
someone broke the window
in the living room.

234
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:50,796
And the chandelier fell too.

235
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,089
Ms. Lee, were you dreaming?

236
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,966
I almost died!

237
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,468
It must've been so vivid.

238
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,095
I have a witness. Kim Dan.

239
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,347
Where did he go?

240
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:01,682
Dan!

241
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,393
Nothing happened to
the lights and windows, right?

242
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,061
-Nothing happened.
-No, nothing.

243
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,729
-Okay.
-What's going on?

244
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,361
All of you are here extra early today.

245
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,655
Are you plotting something?

246
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,451
I asked them to clean up everything
before everyone else arrives.

247
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:23,620
We have worked so hard since dawn,
you know.

248
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,415
Hey, watch your language.

249
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,208
Let me drop the honorifics
since I already did.

250
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,210
My contract didn't say that I couldn't.

251
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,466
The three of them were
in charge of the lights,

252
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,051
the garden, and security last night.

253
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,803
-So I was--
-This worked out well.

254
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:44,141
I actually had something
I wanted to ask them.

255
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:52,608
Who did it?

256
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:56,361
I asked them,

257
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,156
but the lights and the windows were fine
until they got off work.

258
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,283
When everyone went home,
the security guy left too.

259
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:02,951
If you tell me who was behind this,

260
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,328
I will forgive you.

261
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,579
I think it was an accident.

262
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,164
Or I'll fire you,
sue you for compensation,

263
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:08,790
have you arrested,
and make you stand trial.

264
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,000
And I won't stop until the end.

265
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,920
Look at this.
I organized this chronologically.

266
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:16,590
I didn't find a rock or anything
that could be used to break the window.

267
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,800
It's an accident. A pure accident.

268
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:19,927
You're a true detective.

269
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:21,929
What about the chandelier?

270
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,847
Why did that fall all of a sudden?

271
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,099
Did the termites nibble on it?

272
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,061
Why don't we talk?

273
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,605
Do you think I was dreaming?

274
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:33,273
You think I'm delusional?

275
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,152
If you confess,

276
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,196
I will only fire you.

277
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,824
One, and two, and--

278
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:43,909
Darn it!

279
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,746
I can't do this. No, I won't work for you.

280
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,706
Do you think you're a Disney princess?

281
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,124
Go on.

282
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,628
It made me wonder how bad you could be
when I heard the pay was double.

283
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:57,172
Paying me 20 times more won't be enough.

284
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:58,924
You're still wet behind the ears.

285
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,385
You throw a fit, threaten,
and treat us like criminals.

286
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:02,803
I've had enough of this!

287
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,972
Let's leave this place.

288
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,348
-Hold on.
-Let's go!

289
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,975
-Wait. Hold on.
-Gosh

290
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,059
Wait.

291
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:10,352
-Darn it.
-Wait.

292
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,770
-No, no.
-Wait.

293
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:18,443
People are already calling
this place hell.

294
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,154
Ms. Jung, contact the security company.

295
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,699
Bring me all the security footage
from the past three days.

296
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,710
What is this?

297
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,922
EXTERNAL INPUT

298
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:52,060
Excuse me.

299
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,567
Show me the footage from last night.

300
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,319
It was around sunset.

301
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,487
-Start around 6 p.m.
-Okay, ma'am.

302
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:27,888
No.

303
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:28,972
No.

304
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:33,226
What's going on?

305
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:36,396
Why isn't this working?

306
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:40,400
My gosh, this isn't working.

307
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,235
When it rained last night,

308
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,904
something must've gone
wrong with the lines.

309
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:45,947
All the footage up to midnight is ruined.

310
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:47,407
Can't you restore them?

311
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:49,743
It wasn't recorded properly.

312
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,244
I don't think it's possible.

313
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,038
I'm sorry.

314
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:55,707
Okay.

315
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,547
She's not looking, right?

316
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:08,512
What are you doing?

317
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:09,596
I should ask you that.

318
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,515
Are you trying to promote
our world to humans?

319
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:13,225
My wings just came out on their own!

320
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:14,184
Wings?

321
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,603
My gosh, you're driving me crazy.

322
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:20,482
It's the rain, isn't it?

323
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:22,442
I think that's the only way.

324
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:23,652
Anyway, but why?

325
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:26,947
She recognized you
before you became a human on a rainy day.

326
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,198
She did.

327
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:29,950
And you saved her from death
on a rainy day too.

328
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,662
Wow, that's so mean.

329
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,122
You have 94 days left.

330
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:38,583
Humans have a lifespan,
and we have deadlines.

331
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:43,380
We just have to love
the deity, and that's it.

332
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:44,756
But humans...

333
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:47,467
I especially have no idea
what Lee Yeon-seo is like.

334
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:50,345
I don't know if she ever liked anyone
or if there is someone

335
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:52,305
who makes her happy just
with the thought of them.

336
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,641
"The bone of my bones
and flesh of my flesh."

337
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,146
You should first look for her rib.

338
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,314
Isn't it the other way?
It's the guy's rib that--

339
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,400
Come on, stop that. It's the 21st century.

340
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,026
The rib.

341
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:06,987
Humans call that...

342
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:11,658
destiny.

343
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:16,371
Is Ms. Lee in there?

344
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,749
Wait here.

345
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:23,503
Have a good day.

346
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:26,673
Yes, okay. Goodbye.

347
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,223
-Yes?
-Where are you?

348
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,894
I'm on my way in. I just--

349
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,103
Ms. Lee, this is Ji Kang-woo.

350
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,813
I'm in front of your place.
I'm coming in now.

351
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,814
Let's go.

352
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,657
Will you be okay traveling long-distance?

353
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,910
It's your first time in a car
after the accident.

354
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,746
Make sure the employees who got fired
today sign the confidentiality agreement.

355
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:58,914
And train the employees again.

356
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,040
Gosh, I have a headache.

357
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:02,125
That's the way of this world.

358
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,710
There are troublemakers,

359
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:05,754
and there are those who fix things.

360
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,299
Do you still think I'm out of my mind?

361
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:12,052
You can't just go in there.

362
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:13,720
Who said that you can come in?

363
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:16,514
Ms. Lee.

364
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:18,600
Who are you?

365
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:22,395
This is Corporal Ko Seong-min,
a detective of Baegun Police Station.

366
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,231
You actually called the police?

367
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:27,234
Mr. Ji. What gives you
the right to do this?

368
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:28,902
I made myself clear.

369
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,403
I didn't file an official report.

370
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:33,448
Detective Ko is here
because I asked him for a personal favor.

371
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,533
Okay, this is all I can do.

372
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:39,120
You can decide to go ahead with
the investigation after the field survey.

373
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:01,309
Judging by how clean the scene,

374
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,603
it was probably done by someone
who has something to hide.

375
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,190
Probably the culprit.

376
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,487
Gosh, why are there so many of these?

377
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:22,122
This is a record of what the employees

378
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:23,832
did yesterday
and the state of the crime scene.

379
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,166
According to my investigation,

380
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,168
it looks like a simple accident.

381
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,837
The initial investigation
wasn't done right.

382
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,674
You trusted everything
they said and remembered.

383
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,218
If you make a report, I will investigate.

384
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,637
But there isn't any security footage left,

385
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:39,472
and the evidence of the scene is gone,

386
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:41,308
so it'll be pretty tough
to catch the culprit.

387
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:43,560
I see.

388
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,313
Thank you.

389
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,189
We will give you a call later.

390
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,947
Please excuse me. Goodbye.

391
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,624
Why aren't you leaving?

392
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:09,294
I have to talk to you.

393
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:10,587
Please spare me one hour.

394
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:11,713
I was on my way out.

395
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,173
I have to go somewhere.

396
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,550
Right now? Where?

397
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,469
Get the car.

398
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,554
Not even half an hour?

399
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,264
I'm already running late.

400
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,850
Someone who's very rude
brought a detective

401
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,393
and wasted my time.

402
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:30,940
Why are you standing around?

403
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,193
I...

404
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,989
don't know how to drive.

405
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:47,874
Why don't any of your employees drive?

406
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:49,542
We could just take a taxi.

407
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:51,836
Stop talking so much.
You're the one without a license.

408
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:55,507
And why do I have to sit here?

409
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,759
You said you can't let me sit there.

410
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:00,470
Excuse me, you two. I'm trying to drive.

411
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:02,430
You're both a bit too loud.

412
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:39,008
THE LATE LEE JIN-UNG,
NA HUI-SU, CHO SEUNG-HWAN

413
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,812
Mom, Dad, hi.

414
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,274
Did you both meet Mr. Cho?

415
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:58,695
I...

416
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:01,906
I am

417
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,285
not sure what's going on.

418
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:09,539
I can see again, but I can't walk.

419
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,960
It feels like someone is always
targeting me and watching me.

420
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:16,629
It would be much better
if I was just delusional.

421
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,383
Mr. Cho.

422
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:22,761
Why do we only realize

423
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:27,223
a certain moment was the last time
only after it passes by?

424
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:32,562
It drives me crazy whenever the sun sets.

425
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,816
When you said the sunset was pretty,

426
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,569
why didn't I say, "Is that so?

427
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,988
How does it look?

428
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:46,075
I actually want to see it badly too.

429
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:49,162
I am living this world

430
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,289
thanks to your descriptions."

431
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:57,545
Why didn't I tell you that?

432
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,262
You're all so mean.

433
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:09,933
You all left me here alone.

434
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:25,365
I'm sorry

435
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:28,076
for asking if you got dumped
during a sunset.

436
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:29,452
I'm glad you know better now.

437
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,121
Thanks.

438
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:35,250
I began to have hope

439
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,584
in you.

440
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:40,213
I realized that you are capable of love.

441
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:43,174
Love?

442
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:45,760
Yes.

443
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:47,971
It makes your heart flutter,

444
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:49,889
you keep on laughing,

445
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:52,183
and you feel jumpy
because you're so happy.

446
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:55,228
Kim Dan, you are on the wrong track.

447
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:58,940
I really don't get your weird taste,

448
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,692
but I don't fire people because of that.

449
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,361
So stop sucking up to me
and stop overreacting.

450
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,834
I will

451
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:19,711
help you.

452
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:22,589
You can do it.

453
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,842
Stop talking nonsense.
Who do you think you are?

454
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,052
Someone who exists just for you.

455
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:32,849
Let me be frank.

456
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,435
The goal of my life

457
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:38,688
is you.

458
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:41,858
Are you crazy?

459
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,579
Oh, gosh, the rain. It's raining.

460
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:56,956
Go bring the umbrella.

461
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,384
What was he talking about?

462
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:12,597
Thank you.

463
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:20,772
Gosh. What should I do?

464
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:24,400
Why did it have to rain?

465
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:34,619
You'll catch a cold.

466
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,329
I was waiting in the car,

467
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,538
and it started to rain.

468
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:42,585
Let's go.

469
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,131
I'm waiting for Dan.

470
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:50,927
You two must be very close.

471
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,347
I've never seen a secretary
talk casually to his employer.

472
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,598
It just happened that way.

473
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,976
In any case, he's good at what he does.

474
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,353
Then we can wait for him together.

475
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:22,959
It's a waste to wait idly like this.

476
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,627
Do you want to see something fascinating?

477
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,255
Sorry?

478
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:29,382
One minute.

479
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:39,642
You bring that around?

480
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:40,935
Of course not.

481
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:42,854
I prepared it.

482
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:45,481
I wanted to show it to you.

483
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:52,321
You didn't even spare me for 30 minutes.

484
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:04,250
Moscow, 2006.

485
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,794
Swanhilda of Coppélia.

486
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:10,590
"The deity of ballet loves
a young, Oriental girl."

487
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:16,637

488
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:21,768

Lausanne, 2009.

493
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,036
Kitri from Don Quixote.

494
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:00,098
I like you.

495
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,523
I like you so much

496
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:10,775
that it's driving me insane.

497
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:15,780
You shouldn't be just walking on land
in your tennis shoes.

498
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:20,034
You should be prancing on the clouds
and running in celestial paradise.

499
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:22,745
Let me help you

500
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,164
start ballet once again.

501
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:32,380
It'll be very late once you arrive home.

502
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,965
He went to grab an umbrella

503
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,050
and only returned
once the rain had stopped.

504
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:38,219
At least we won't be driving in the rain.

505
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:40,721
What?

506
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:54,902
Ms. Lee.

507
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:57,488
You're okay now. Everything is okay.

508
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:58,865
I'm here, Ms. Lee.

509
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,449
You're okay now.

510
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,118
Everything is okay.

511
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:04,579
I'm here.

512
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,706
Ms. Lee Yeon-seo.

513
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,259
Was it...

514
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:21,762
you

515
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:23,723
on the day of the accident?

516
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,398
I can finally give this to you.

517
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,414
Were you the one

518
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,501
who called the ambulance

519
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,631
and held my hand?

520
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,467
Was it you?

521
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:02,470
Do you finally remember?

522
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,138
Why didn't you tell me from the start?

523
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,891
It wasn't something to boast about.

524
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:09,518
I'm sorry for startling you guys.

525
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:10,728
I'll drive more carefully.

526
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:16,567
"The bone of my bones
and flesh of my flesh."

527
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:18,694
You should first look for her rib.

528
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:20,446
Humans call that

529
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,240
destiny.

530
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:45,388
Thank you

531
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,598
for driving us around all day today.

532
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:49,642
I'm more grateful

533
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:51,686
that you spared some time for me.

534
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,147
Let's go.

535
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:56,857
Wait a minute.

536
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:07,493
What is that?

537
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:09,203
A bribe.

538
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,747
I'd like to get to know your secretary.

539
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,751
I bought one yesterday, but it got ruined.

540
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:19,213
But I can always buy more of them.

541
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,007
Here.

542
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:23,551
I hope we get to know each other more.

543
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:40,651
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

544
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,696
Won-il. Let's forget about it.

545
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:45,072
How could I?

546
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,617
It clearly happened.

547
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:50,745
What is it exactly?

548
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,873
I heard you drink every day
since Mr. Cho passed away.

549
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:55,750
I keep seeing it in my dreams.

550
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:56,792
See what?

551
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:00,755
I'm so scared.

552
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,299
Every time there was a suitable donor,

553
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:05,634
there was someone she'd always call first.

554
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:09,013
And after that call ended,
the donation got canceled.

555
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:10,806
I made the call.

556
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,392
I know. General Director Choi
probably ordered you.

557
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:17,772
I didn't know you were like this.

558
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:18,731
Look.

559
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:22,234
In order to make a living,
I must do what I'm told.

560
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:24,278
Even so,

561
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,447
you'll only end up dirtying

562
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:29,533
your own hands.

563
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:32,953
Before she does something worse,

564
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:35,748
tell her to leave Fantasia

565
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:37,750
quietly.

566
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:39,710
But...

567
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:40,878
Wait.

568
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:42,755
I didn't think of it as a big deal.

569
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:46,717
Even North and South Korea argue in words

570
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,928
but never put anything into action.

571
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:59,188
-It's as if somebody cut it.
-He said the brakes were cut off

572
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:01,941
-as if someone had intentionally cut them.
-Here it is.

573
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:06,695
I just went to scrap the car

574
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:09,323
because Ms. Choi had told me to.

575
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:15,746
Are you insane?

576
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:18,374
How could you quit working at Ivy Mansion?

577
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,006
Did she call the police?

578
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,760
What if the security camera caught you?

579
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:31,470
I was afraid the others

580
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:33,389
would spill if we stayed any longer.

581
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:36,725
Then

582
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,854
what about the documents
Mr. Cho had gathered?

583
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:44,191
We were told that Ms. Lee
had the key to that room.

584
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:46,944
You went through all that

585
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,530
only to get fired empty-handed?

586
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:50,739
I'm sorry, ma'am.

587
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:53,033
I'm so vexed.

588
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:56,620
He's irritating me even after his death.

589
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,829
He never listened.

590
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:40,539
BALLET CONCOURS AT MOSCOW

591
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:42,333
I had told him to throw these away.

592
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,261
Let me help you

593
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,680
start ballet once again.

594
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:59,225
No. I did every dance
I wanted as a ballerina.

595
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:00,893
And I had all the glory
as a ballerina too.

596
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:01,977
I have no regrets.

597
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:05,564
So stop thinking about using my body
to accomplish your adventurous goals.

598
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,566
You can go higher than this.

599
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:08,776
And you ought to.

600
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:10,778
Just this once.

601
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:12,321
Please trust me this once.

602
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:15,491
Gosh. With what you just said,
you became someone

603
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:16,450
I should never trust.

604
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:19,286
"Trust me. I'm different. I mean it."

605
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:21,330
Those are the clichés.

606
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:24,333
I became an orphan at the age of 17.
I've heard that too many times.

607
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:25,918
The more affectionate you are,

608
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,461
the bigger the reward is.

609
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,216
She said no.

610
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:34,885
She was ruthless when she turned me down.

611
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:42,393
What should I do

612
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:45,020
to make Lee Yeon-seo's heart beat again?

613
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,594
SECRETARY AT IVY MANSION, KIM DAN

614
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:22,433
KIM DAN
AGE: 25

615
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:27,271
He neither has connections
nor any support.

616
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:29,440
No money, no ambition.

617
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,736
Did they become close
because he's approachable?

618
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,794
Gureum, what is love?

619
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:58,677
Are you also destined to find
the one with your rib?

620
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:04,725
Whatever.

621
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:15,277
I found my mission target,

622
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:18,364
Lee Yeon-seo's rib.

623
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:25,329
I think I found it,

624
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:27,831
but I might be wrong.

625
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,583
How can I know for sure
if he's her destiny?

626
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,293
What if he's not her destiny?

627
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,881
Is she allowed to come to me instead?

628
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:40,969
What if he's not her true destiny?

629
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:47,393
What? I'm being lame?

630
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:48,977
Come on, you're being too harsh.

631
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:02,825
There you go again.
You and your cheap habits.

632
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:04,827
I told you to stay seated.

633
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:11,917
Thank you.

634
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,340
Honey, you're going to be

635
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:20,300
the official chairman of Fantasia soon.

636
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:23,095
We should live up to it
to our bones, okay?

637
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:31,895
What? Is something on my face?

638
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:35,607
You have sleep in your left eye.

639
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:38,944
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

640
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:40,112
-Did you sleep well?
-Yes.

641
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:44,616
I have something to announce.

642
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:47,953
Ru-na and I

643
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:49,997
have been talking.

644
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:53,333
I think we're being too hard on Yeon-seo.

645
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:57,087
After that day at the hospital,
we didn't even check up on her.

646
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,339
We're still a family.

647
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:03,051
I've been busy too. I totally forgot too.

648
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:04,970
What should we do?

649
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,432
What can we do?

650
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:11,268
She has hundreds of people
working for her.

651
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:14,480
I'm sure she's eating well
and living a good life...

652
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,024
No.

653
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:19,151
I'm very worried.

654
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:20,903
Right.

655
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:23,530
We've been too inattentive to her, right?

656
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:39,213
Gureum.

657
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:42,341
Lee Gureum. Wake up.

658
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:43,300
Gureum!

659
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:44,551
Gureum.

660
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:46,929
Gureum. Wake up. Gureum.

661
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:50,307
Dan, what did you feed Gureum?

662
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:53,143
Gureum.

663
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:58,857
It was a small amount.
Gureum should be fine.

664
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:00,567
We'll keep an eye on Gureum
for a few days.

665
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:04,571
Why did you feed Gureum chocolate?

666
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:07,241
It was probably a piece
my employee dropped.

667
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:13,872
Gureum is the only family I have left.

668
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:17,000
If something happens to Gureum,

669
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:19,586
I'll really be alone.

670
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:24,132
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

671
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:25,676
Can't you stop saying sorry?

672
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:29,972
I don't want to hear it.

673
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:32,599
But you're not alone.

674
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:34,977
You have me,

675
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:36,645
Ms. Jung,

676
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:38,146
and your employees too.

677
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:40,107
Are you going to stay with me forever?

678
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:41,692
Until I grow old and die?

679
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,323
I thought you existed for me.

680
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:50,617
You said I was the goal of your life.

681
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:54,705
Yes, that's true. But--

682
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:56,790
Stop it. Be quiet.

683
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:21,773
Here.

684
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:24,735
I only made a copy
since I didn't have time.

685
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:36,580
Gosh, no. This isn't it either.

686
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:42,628
Get some rest.

687
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:45,756
-Congratulations
-Congratulations

688
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:48,133
-Congratulations
-Congratulations

689
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,677
-Congratulations
-Congratulations

690
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:53,513
-On your recovery
-On your recovery

691
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:56,391
Everyone, this is the best
ballerina in Korea, Lee Yeon-seo.

692
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:57,851
I bet you missed her.

693
00:48:57,934 --> 00:48:59,978
-Get that out of my face.
-Can you see her?

694
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:02,022
This is a surprise party
we prepared for her.

695
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:03,940
-She can see again.
-This is fun.

696
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:05,484
-Please give my cousin...
-Right?

697
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:09,821
...a lot of applause and love.

698
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:13,283
Why is he just standing there?

699
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:20,290
I told you to stop.

700
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:24,836
The candle...

701
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:26,713
It's out.

702
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:27,964
Who let you in?

703
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:30,175
Everyone knows we're your family.

704
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,135
Honey, Yeon-seo is here!

705
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:33,595
Come down quickly.

706
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:35,138
She went upstairs?

707
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:37,432
Who said you could?

708
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:41,061
GILDAM HOSPITAL

709
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:47,901
I wish I could just
burn all of these at once.

710
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:50,070
That way, it will be simple and easy.

711
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:52,322
The records...

712
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:58,370
Slow down. You'll fall.

713
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:12,968
You're back, Yeon-seo.

714
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:19,725
My gosh.

715
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,643
Nothing's changed around here.

716
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,103
You took good care of the house.

717
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:30,527
I heard you still need him to walk.

718
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:33,321
That's terrible.

719
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:38,243
CONGRATULATIONS, YEON-SEO

720
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:48,086
All right.

721
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:50,338
Since everyone is here,

722
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:52,507
let's have a glass of wine to celebrate.

723
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:54,926
Sure. Let's sit.

724
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,511
Get out. I'm tired.

725
00:50:58,889 --> 00:50:59,806
Yeon-seo.

726
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:01,933
Can't you open up to us just a little bit?

727
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:04,644
We made an effort
to celebrate your recovery--

728
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:06,480
I received these corneas after a man died.

729
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:08,774
Is that something to
celebrate with a party?

730
00:51:10,066 --> 00:51:12,694
I prayed for you every day,

731
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:15,405
so we could dance on the stage again.

732
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:17,532
You were very kind
ever since we were kids.

733
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:18,784
Right?

734
00:51:19,284 --> 00:51:20,160
You

735
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:23,246
want to get recognized
by everyone except me

736
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:25,874
because you can never beat
me at anything except for being nice.

737
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:27,334
I never could.

738
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:32,255
-What?
-Let's make it clear.

739
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:34,257
I could never beat you.
That's in the past now.

740
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:36,468
Three years ago when your eyes were fine.

741
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:44,976
You should leave.

742
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:46,978
I think that's for the best.

743
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:49,731
Sure.

744
00:51:51,399 --> 00:51:52,317
Okay.

745
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:54,236
Let's go.

746
00:51:56,321 --> 00:51:58,198
Let's go. Let's go, Ni-na.

747
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:01,576
Come on, let's go.

748
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:12,462
I must be crazy.

749
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:14,297
Why did I do that?

750
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,383
Great job, my girl.

751
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:18,218
Even I felt so relieved.

752
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:22,597
Let's go. Come on, let's go.

753
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:37,529
Isn't she your aunt? What's wrong?

754
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,489
Your family came to celebrate with you.

755
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:40,448
Shut up.

756
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:45,161
-I don't understand--
-Just shut up.

757
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:46,329
Hey, Lee Yeon-seo!

758
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:47,330
This is your problem.

759
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:49,082
You get smug easily
whenever I'm nice to you.

760
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:51,501
Don't tell me what to do.
You have no right to do that.

761
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:52,544
No, I will.

762
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:55,505
Because I'm a human with a conscience
who is very rational.

763
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:57,507
You shouldn't be like that as a human.

764
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:00,677
What did I do?

765
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,929
How long will you act rude as you please?

766
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,764
Are you a five-year-old?
Even a kid can be better.

767
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:06,516
They came to congratulate you.

768
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:09,227
They came wishing you happiness
from now on.

769
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:11,980
Did you have to be so rude to them?

770
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:14,316
It's up to me if I want to
be rude or mean to them.

771
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:15,901
You're the one who'll get hurt.

772
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:18,528
Let me make myself clear.

773
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:20,530
You're here in Mr. Cho's place.

774
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:22,657
Mr. Cho said everything was okay.

775
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:24,868
I didn't have to do things
if I didn't like it.

776
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:26,703
He made things happen
when I wanted to do things.

777
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:30,707
I'm Kim Dan. Not that foolish man!

778
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:32,250
What?

779
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:34,044
It figures.

780
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:36,254
That nice man didn't do anything wrong.

781
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:38,006
He probably didn't know
kindness can be bad

782
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:39,758
for someone who isn't afraid of anything

783
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:42,636
and gets frustrated when
she doesn't get her way.

784
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:47,849
I took you in because I felt bad
that you are left all alone in this world.

785
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:49,267
Are you all done?

786
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:52,145
If you can pity me
because I am left alone in this world,

787
00:53:52,228 --> 00:53:54,564
why are you so mean
to the rest of your family?

788
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:56,191
You regret things.

789
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:59,194
Are you going to regret this again
when everyone is gone?

790
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:00,737
What if that was the last time?

791
00:54:01,237 --> 00:54:03,615
What if you can't turn back the time,
you foolish gong!

792
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:05,992
Stop it.

793
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:14,167
-You threw this at me?
-I did. So what?

794
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:15,418
You!

795
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:17,420
You take this too.

796
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:19,339
You!

797
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,469
My gosh, seriously.

798
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:26,054
Hey.

799
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,390
Stop. Let's stop here.

800
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:32,394
You little...

801
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:36,106
-Let go of me.
-You let go.

802
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,191
Darn it.

803
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:39,567
Hey, wait.

804
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,362
You can't let your blood pressure rise.

805
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:44,155
-Drop it on three, okay?
-Okay.

806
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:46,199
Okay, then. Now, one, two, three.

807
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:47,993
Hey, that hurts.

808
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:50,620
You're fired.

809
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:52,622
Fine, I can't do this anymore either.

810
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:55,250
I'm a fool for seeing hope in you.

811
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:58,169
You're hopeless, useless, and helpless.

812
00:54:58,253 --> 00:54:59,629
You're worse than a gong.

813
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:01,840
How can you be so heartless?

814
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:04,634
Goodness!

815
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:27,574
"Forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those

816
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:33,663
who trespass against us"

817
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:36,750
Darn it! Did I do something wrong?

818
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:38,334
If I'm at fault, just let me know.

819
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:55,643
Why have you forsaken me?

820
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:07,989
HOUSEKEEPER JUNG YU-MI

821
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:31,221
Drink up.

822
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:33,681
When your heart is on fire,

823
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:35,642
this is the best remedy.

824
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:55,370
Gosh, that burns.

825
00:56:58,081 --> 00:56:59,999
Can you please

826
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:05,880
bow down before her just this once?

827
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:11,678
Like I said, I didn't do anything wrong.

828
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:16,683
And you know she's the type

829
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:19,185
who wouldn't take me back
after she fired me.

830
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:20,979
Why do you keep asking me?

831
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:25,775
I don't know.

832
00:57:27,193 --> 00:57:28,820
I'm not really sure.

833
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:34,242
She looked comfortable
when she was with you.

834
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:39,914
The last time she bickered with someone
was when she was ten.

835
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:45,253
Without you, she would
have to resort to a walking stick.

836
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:49,883
Just this once.

837
00:57:51,676 --> 00:57:52,594
Can you do that?

838
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:58,099
I can't lie.

839
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:01,102
I can't say I'm sorry
when I didn't do anything wrong.

840
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:02,770
Never.

841
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:05,940
That's hot.

842
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:12,405
Drink this. It's chamomile tea.

843
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:14,991
I know you drink this
when you can't sleep.

844
00:58:20,788 --> 00:58:21,873
KIM DAN

845
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:32,592
Lee Yeon-seo.

846
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:40,725
Lee Yeon-seo.

847
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:45,647
Why won't she answer me?

848
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:55,031
Lee Yeon-seo

849
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:59,702
can trip over this and fall down.

850
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:06,167
Lee Yeon-seo hates these.

851
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:11,589
Why are these so heavy?

852
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:24,811
Lee Yeon-seo

853
00:59:25,436 --> 00:59:28,856
might step on this and slip.

854
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:30,650
Go away.

855
00:59:30,858 --> 00:59:33,319
Hey, go away.

856
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:34,237
What are you doing?

857
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:37,282
Hey!

858
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:39,951
There's the rude princess.

859
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:45,748
I forgot to sweep that.

860
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:47,375
I thought I should clean that.

861
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:49,168
This is my last day here.

862
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:50,795
Give me the access card.

863
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:57,552
You got hurt.

864
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:03,474
I'm sorry.

865
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:05,226
I said I don't want to hear you say that.

866
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:14,902
This is me.

867
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:17,655
Think of this as me.

868
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,075
You're okay when you're with me.

869
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:23,077
Even without me,

870
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:25,663
it's as if I am here with you.

871
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:30,376
You can go anywhere if you have this.

872
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:33,338
I'll put a spell on it.

873
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:37,133
Abracadabra.

874
01:00:39,677 --> 01:00:40,887
It'll be great if you can

875
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:44,015
dance again with this on, Lee Yeon-seo.

876
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:48,019
Instead of feeling like
someone is targeting you,

877
01:00:49,103 --> 01:00:52,190
I hope you can feel that
everyone is amazed

878
01:00:54,233 --> 01:00:55,610
at your dance.

879
01:00:56,736 --> 01:00:59,864
It feels like someone is always
targeting me and watching me.

880
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:03,034
It would be much better
if I was just delusional.

881
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:06,371
You're very cheeky to the very end.

882
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:09,499
"Trust me. I'm different.

883
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:11,000
I mean it."

884
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:14,087
I hope you can believe what I said.

885
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:16,798
I hope you can feel more grateful

886
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:19,217
for someone who is more
affectionate to you.

887
01:01:21,886 --> 01:01:24,389
"Trust me. I'm different. I mean it."

888
01:01:24,972 --> 01:01:26,099
Those are the clichés.

889
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:29,936
I became an orphan at the age of 17.
I've heard that too many times.

890
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:32,271
The more affectionate you are,

891
01:01:32,563 --> 01:01:33,940
the bigger the reward is.

892
01:01:40,905 --> 01:01:41,823
No.

893
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:43,908
We don't have to do it later.

894
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:48,579
Do it with me right now. Let's dance.

895
01:01:49,163 --> 01:01:50,206
I'll take this.

896
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:51,708
Hey.

897
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:56,838
-Okay.
-What's with you?

898
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:58,381
What are you doing?

899
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:47,388
See?

900
01:02:48,055 --> 01:02:50,224
You're most beautiful
when you are dancing.

901
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:50,952
I have to walk without a stick
by next week.

902
01:03:51,118 --> 01:03:52,620
I have to walk no matter what happens.

903
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:55,373
But I have a condition.

904
01:03:55,456 --> 01:03:56,791
All right. Come to me.

905
01:03:56,958 --> 01:04:00,169
Imagine that it's just
you and me in this world.

906
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:01,212
You con man.

907
01:04:01,295 --> 01:04:03,965
If I have to leave, I will.
But not like this!

908
01:04:04,715 --> 01:04:06,717
There is no ballerina who has three legs.

909
01:04:07,718 --> 01:04:09,345
You survived from the verge of death,

910
01:04:09,595 --> 01:04:11,097
so I believe
that you will live a new life.

911
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:12,890
We were going to leave out
Lee Yeon-seo's name

912
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:14,684
and do a press call
for this year's performance.

913
01:04:14,767 --> 01:04:17,812
Do not help me no matter what happens.
