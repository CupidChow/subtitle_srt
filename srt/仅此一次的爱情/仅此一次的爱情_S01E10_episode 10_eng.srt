2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,130
You'd like me to stay like this?

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,440
Don't say anything and just stand there.

4
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:28,590


5
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,140
♫  One, two, a one two three four  ♫

♫  I will never forget  ♫

00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:00,850
♫  The way the rescued me from summer heat

♫  Isn't it much better  ♫

12
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:22,290
♫  When we, we decide to stick together  ♫

13
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,890
O-One second!

14
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:29,570
♫  Something sweeter you see  ♫

15
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:34,580
Hey!!

16
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,330
Oh, Ms. Butler.

17
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,580
You have a guest.

18
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,910
The temperature and humidity are all good. The mirrors are clean, too.

19
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,860
And it's bright.

20
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:07,680
- Are you here to watch over me? 
- I came because I wanted to see.

21
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,970
I was worried about the place and the environment in which you practice.

22
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,750
You really don't need a trainer or masseuse?

23
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:20,210
I am still worried that you are doing this all alone.

24
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:23,750
I'm not alone. I have him

25
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:29,240
and Ms. Butler. Even if I were alone, I'd manage it by myself.

26
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,510
Fantasia Night has been scheduled in two weeks.

27
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:39,060
Let us decide how you will participate depending on your condition in a week.

28
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:44,390
We'll see if you'll be there as a ballerina or as the chairwoman of the foundation.

29
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,100
That's a long way of saying I should stay on alert.

30
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,910
I'm sorry for taking up so much of your time. I'll be going now.

31
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,960
Oh, Secretary Kim, I need to see you.

32
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,950
- Me? 
- Just for a second. I have a question to ask you.

33
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,360
What is it? I have to go back soon.

34
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,060
- Why are you acting like this? 
- Who are you, really?

35
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,560
I'll ask again. What are you after?

36
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,720
Were you trying to approach me first to see how Yeon Seo feels?

37
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,240
Did you comfort me saying you'll help out, only to betray me later?

38
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,880
Are you after her money? Are you a gigolo?

39
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,520
Did you get a job here as a secretary to get her to like you and then steal her money?

40
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:59,600
What are you talking about? Her money? What nonsense—

41
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,770
I was never interested in the wealth of this land.

42
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:05,400
I don't want those things that will eventually rot away.

43
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,720
Then, do you really like her?

44
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,850
- Wh-What? 
- See here.

45
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:16,310
You and Yeon Seo are from different worlds.

46
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,140
- I know that more than anyone. 
- Then give up on her at once.

47
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,950
Don't get your hopes up like a fool.

48
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:27,880
If you distract Yeon Seo from dancing with your fake show of feelings,

49
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,470
I'll never forgive you. Got it?

50
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,200
Who is accusing who of wha—

51
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,020
What?!

52
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,710
Senior, where are you?

53
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,430
Senior? Senior!!

54
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:53,660
Senior, it's an emergency. Senior—

55
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,440
I have something to ask you.

56
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,830
How fitting, since people who wear these clothes are listening experts.

57
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:10,530
Here? Have you ever kissed with a human?

58
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,360
What, what, what?! What is it now?

59
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,550
Dropping in suddenly all the time...

60
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:29,860
You freely put on and discard human forms

61
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,690
and your wings never spring out, right?

62
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:34,970
Right. So?

63
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:38,180
In my opinion, it's this body.

64
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:42,540
This kid, why are you going on about the body? Do you want to become dust and disappear??

65
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:47,350
I'm not done with this mission! Also, about that mission...

66
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,770
It said to find her love.

67
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:58,420
But it has to be love between a human and another human,

68
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,880
probably?

69
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,530
After somehow kissing her,

70
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:12,590
this spot here beats fast as if it were broken and my ribs

71
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:16,730
suddenly feel tight, and Rib...

72
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:21,560
he keeps asking me if I like Yeon Seo.

73
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,720
What to do with you?

74
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:32,810
Hold on. Was it fifteen years ago...?

75
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:36,770
There was this angel who was in charge of art.

76
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,840
 He took on the human form and was given a mission 

77
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,130
 to inspire artists. 

78
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,760
No, not this one. I don't like it!

79
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,970
What the hell! Did it go wrong this time?

80
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:03,090
This is the 43rd time for God's sake.

81
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,960
Where are you going?! Give me another canvas!

82
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,070
I failed!

83
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:14,340
 He met this person as he began to grow tired of picky artists. 

84
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:27,920
♫  The lives we play behind the mask  ♫

85
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:34,020
♫  A constant breath of pain  ♫

86
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:40,200
♫  our minds belong to those who ask  ♫

87
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:46,710
♫  to those who seek to change  ♫

88
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:55,190
♫  I can say anything that I want, so watch me pray  ♫

89
00:07:55,190 --> 00:08:02,960
♫  I can see everything turn away from me  ♫

90
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:08,980
♫  There was a word of God  ♫

91
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:20,730
 They say it's easy to get confused... Angels of art especially. 

92
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:24,980
 He mistook inspiration for love. 

93
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,770
 An angel, loving a being aside from God? 

94
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,710
 Is that even possible? 

95
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:40,920
So, you can become a human with this?

96
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:46,850
No angel knows how, but I have to make this confession.

97
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:55,380
♫  I believe in things that I see, I pray  ♫

98
00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:01,510
♫  I don't know if I can anymore. So watch me pray  ♫

99
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,710
♫  I can see everything turn away  ♫

100
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:09,650
From this moment on— No, from that moment on,

101
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,970
my love belongs to her.

102
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:18,190
 That I could meet her, and fall in love with her, 

103
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:23,120
is all Your doing. Please, give us your blessing.

104
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,820
 Believing that you can love someone other than God, 

105
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,890
 that is an act of arrogance and sin. 

106
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,020
What happened to him? That angel?

107
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:46,160
What do you think would happen to an angel who threw aside God?

108
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:58,230
 Dan, an angel will be judged. 

109
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,610
 I want to live. 

110
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:03,410
 You dare to meddle in the life that God had control over. 

111
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,750
 I like you so much that it's driving me insane. 

112
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:11,500
 You neglected and forgot your mission given to you by God. 

113
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,330
 By not carrying it out, you have sinned. 

114
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:19,420
 Just look at me. Imagine that it's just you and me in this world. 

115
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:23,150
 Above all, you've deluded yourself into thinking 

116
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:27,530
 that you loved an insignificant being more than God. 

117
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:31,230
 You'll be dissipated. 

118
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:17,700
Kim Dan!

119
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,410
Ma'am, what is it?

120
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,840
It's been hours.

121
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,300
She's refusing to eat and not letting anyone in.

122
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,770
That's enough.

123
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:27,100
Don't overexert yourself.

124
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:38,090
I said that's enough.

125
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,990
Did you forget?

126
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:44,660
You shouldn't touch me.

127
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,060
You're bleeding.

128
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:57,470
So what?

129
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,220
My toenails have fallen off many times.

130
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,530
I've thrown away countless pairs of bloody pointe shoes.

131
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,800
This is nothing.

132
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:18,350
Finally, they look like a ballerina's feet.

133
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:32,030
I didn't know you had to push yourself... this much.

134
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,230
You're going through so much pain.

135
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:41,440
Let's call it a day, okay?

136
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:46,780
Don't be ridiculous. I made a promise to Director Ji.

137
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:50,770
I've to get back in shape within a week.

138
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,670
Listen to me. You can't continue practicing with this foot. What if you get injured once again?

139
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,580
Are you going to return to being someone who's in solitude and grumpy?

140
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:04,480
None of this matters if you're unhappy.

141
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,020
I hate you.

142
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,780
Don't be worried about me. Don't care for me.

143
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:18,950
I hate... receiving love.

144
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:21,620
It makes me want to become weak.

145
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:26,640
It makes me think that it's okay to be weak.

146
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,610
I thought you liked me.

147
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:35,590
I really did.

148
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:40,990
You said you existed because of me. You were the one who sweet-talked me.

149
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:44,610
If you're neither a liar nor a spy, then it's only one thing.

150
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,210
Do you like me?

151
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:50,750
 Believing that you can love something other than God 

152
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,550
 is an act of arrogance and sin. 

153
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:58,740
You said you couldn't lie. Just say yes or no.

154
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:02,100
Did you like me?

155
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,490
Do you?

156
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,580
No.

157
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,500
All right, then.

158
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,520
Get lost.

159
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:43,810
♫  When the cold wind touches  ♫

160
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:47,650
♫  The window of my house  ♫

161
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:50,820
♫  I think of you  ♫

162
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:54,490
♫  Who came to me gently  ♫

163
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:59,360
♫  Slowly, little by little  ♫

164
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:05,050
♫  By that time when you were knocking  ♫

165
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,710
♫  On that door  ♫

166
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:12,690
 I had almost made a mistake, but I'm currently carrying out my mission.  

167
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:14,870
 This is Dan, an angel. 

168
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:17,040
♫  Every night in the future  ♫

169
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,670
 My subject has begun dancing once again. 

170
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:26,140
 She's very sensitive and rough-tempered. 

171
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:37,960
♫  Stars falling this night when I'm thinking of you alone  ♫

172
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:45,670
♫  I know that you're sick of this   ♫

173
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:49,770
♫  On a night when cherry blossoms are scattering  ♫

174
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:53,360
♫  The night you draw alone  ♫

175
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:59,720
♫  Underneath the moonlight's warm wind  ♫

176
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:09,020
♫  When the cold air  ♫

177
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,890
♫  Sweeps my cheek  ♫

178
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:16,010
♫  I think of you  ♫

179
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:19,470
♫  Who came to me gently  ♫

180
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:23,080
♫  Keep moving little by little  ♫

181
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:30,430
 I'm struggling alone without receiving any signs or prophecies. 

182
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:36,030
♫  Now  ♫

183
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:39,890
♫  I still don't know about it  ♫

184
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:43,830
♫  But every day in the future  ♫

185
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,860
♫  It'll be filled with the nights  ♫

186
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:51,130
 At first, her temper was a problem. But now, she's too busy 

187
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:54,680
 to love anyone. 

188
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:59,640
 Could there be a way for her to succeed in 

189
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,690
 both ballet and love? 

190
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:06,930
♫  You're sick of this  ♫

191
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:10,960
♫  On a night when cherry blossoms are scattering  ♫

192
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,730
♫  The night you draw alone  ♫

193
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:20,900
♫  Underneath the moonlight's  ♫

194
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,280
♫  Warm wind  ♫

195
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,760
   

196
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:35,140
You're unbelievable!

197
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,270
Miss!

198
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:42,330
Wake up! It's morning!

199
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:45,950
What date is it today? What day is it?

200
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:50,390
It's D-Day. It's been exactly a week since your announcement.

201
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:54,110
You shouldn't have stayed up all night to practice.

202
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,900
You get a zero for not taking care of yourself.

203
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:05,020
Your aunt called so many times this morning.

204
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,890
Look at this. She calls me every five minutes.

205
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,570
It's me.

206
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,890
Right now?

207
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:29,010
You didn't come with your secretary today?

208
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:31,750
Please wait outside for me.

209
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:39,140
You never answer my questions.

210
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,090
How do you feel? Are you all right?

211
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:44,620
Give me the withdrawal agreement on the power of attorney. I brought my seal.

212
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,940
My gosh, that's not ready yet.

213
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,720
You said I needed to sign it today. That's why you told me to come out.

214
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,730
Is that what you told her?

215
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:53,830
My attorney is very meticulous.

216
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:56,590
So my attorney needs to check it a few more times.

217
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:57,630
I'm sorry.

218
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,630
I'll get going then.

219
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:02,630
Wait. Have some tea before you go. I'm your aunt.

220
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,940
We're not that close, you know.

221
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:09,070
You must've been very disappointed in me.

222
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:11,460
To make up for that...

223
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,450


224
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,500
♫  I love you  ♫

225
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,290
What's this?

226
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:22,860
It's Fantasia Night next week!

227
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,150
Wear them to the event.

228
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:27,000
You know I never serve my guests at events.

229
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,210
A very important Japanese investor will be coming.  When I told him your name, he said he'd come.

230
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:35,110
We can't hold the comeback show without his money.

231
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:38,940
Sometimes, you must do things you don't want to do. That's the world of adults.

232
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,750
We decided to announce that everything about

233
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:46,780
Fantasia will belong to you, Yeon Seo, at the event that day.

234
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,290
See how nice it is to start dancing again.

235
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:59,240
You can walk with me like this even without Dan.

236
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,110
He has no place to go. Where did he go on his vacation?

237
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,500
What did he say?

238
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,330
No. Don't answer.

239
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:13,320
I heard bosses who ask about vacation spots are the worst.

240
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:20,660
On the day of the Fantasia Night, I'll make him escort you no matter what.

241
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:24,890
Let's hurry. I need to practice.

242
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:43,530
I couldn't make him wait in an empty house.

243
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:55,140
This has been the longest week of this year.

244
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,100
Are you ready?

245
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,240
No, not at all. I'm totally doomed.

246
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,850
It's all a mess.

247
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,900
Yeon Seo.

248
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:07,640
Yes?

249
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,470
Make yourself comfortable. This will take a while.

250
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,830
- Where are we going? 
- Well...

251
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,780
To the beginning.

252
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:44,130
♫  I like where we are heading now  ♫

253
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:48,620
♫  These little feelings are so fun  ♫

254
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:54,870
♫  You're like the noise inside my head  ♫

255
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:59,090
♫  Can't think of reasons when you're there  ♫

256
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:02,730
♫  There's sometimes it's true  ♫

257
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:08,040
♫  I think of you, and when I don't,  ♫

258
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,070
♫  I think of you  ♫

259
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,720
♫  I'm crazy over  ♫

260
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,870
♫  You  ♫

261
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:20,460
♫  Got to admit another night to tell you where it is  ♫

262
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,460
♫  And I am crazy over  ♫

263
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:27,320
♫  You  ♫

264
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:31,510
♫  You can tell me anything so that I can make you stay  ♫

265
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,440
♫  I am crazy over  ♫

266
00:23:58,730 --> 00:23:59,820
This place...

267
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,800
Do you remember?

268
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,100
It feels familiar.

269
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:09,410
What is this? What are you plotting? Why did we come all the way here, riding a car and boat?

270
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:12,940
2005. Right before you went to Russia for your studies.

271
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:16,180
You went to an island for a program called Visiting Ballet.

272
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:19,930
How did you know that? Did you look into my past?

273
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,930
Kim Dan told you, right?

274
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,750
She knows everything.

275
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:29,580
I bet Kim Dan did everything here, right?

276
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:32,810
Hey, Kim Dan!  Where are you? Come out.

277
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:35,880
Darn it.  What's wrong with her?

278
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:40,580
You're my prima ballerina. You don't think I would know when she was born and how she grew up?

279
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:48,040
You said you didn't want to do ballet, so you hid and cried. I heard that's what you did.

280
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:51,700
I didn't even know that. How did he know that?

281
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,500
I knew a kid.

282
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:01,510
I've totally forgotten about the kid. That kid was my first audience.

283
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:04,940
I danced for him.

284
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,320
Just for him.

285
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,580
Today, I'll watch your dance.

286
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,090
That dance you did for your first audience.

287
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:15,790
I don't remember. I just made up my dance moves since I was a kid.

288
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,210
I can't make the turns.

289
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,830
I can pull off the other techniques once I get my muscles in shape and practice more.

290
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,870
But I can't make the turns.

291
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:38,820
That's expected.

292
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:43,620
You didn't dance for three years. It's been only a week. Did you think I'd expect you to be perfect?

293
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:46,690
You're too confident of yourself.

294
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:52,420
I wanted to see how determined you were.

295
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:57,520
Your rhomboid, spinal erectors, and the soleus muscle.

296
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:02,070
It took you a week to get them this far. It's a miracle.

297
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,370
Well said, Rib.

298
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:08,820
Take it easy.

299
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:13,440
Don't worry about turnout, balance or anything else. Dance like it's your first time.

300
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:59,750
♫  The stillness that pushes your heart  ♫

301
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:04,640
♫  The warmth that disappeared  ♫

302
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,480
♫  Like a miracle  ♫

303
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:14,380
♫  Come back to me  ♫

304
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:19,330
♫  Your dreams that came up white  ♫

305
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:24,120
♫  That unsuspectingly soothing bland smile  ♫

306
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:31,700
♫  Gently shaking my heart  ♫

307
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,820
♫  Without trace on the streets  ♫

308
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:43,670
♫  Like strangers  ♫

309
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:50,340
♫  Wandering back and forth every day   ♫

310
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:56,970
♫  With these tough hearts  ♫

311
00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:02,260
♫  At the end of a long wait  ♫

312
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:07,180
♫  Without the sound of delicate rain  ♫

313
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:11,560
♫  It's the tears that make me soaked  ♫

314
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:16,410
♫  At the end of a season   ♫

315
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:21,990
♫  Our time together  ♫

316
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:29,680
♫  Will be shining brilliantly like a gleaming shining light  ♫

317
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:34,330
♫  I like it  ♫

318
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:55,650
♫  Without trace on the streets  ♫

319
00:28:55,650 --> 00:29:01,390
♫  Like strangers  ♫

320
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:08,500
♫  Wandering back and forth every day   ♫

321
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:14,750
♫  With these tough hearts  ♫

322
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:20,040
♫  At the end of a long wait  ♫

323
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:25,030
♫  Without the sound of delicate rain  ♫

324
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:27,230
♫  It's the tears that make me soaked  ♫

325
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:29,360
 Good news. 

326
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:34,980
 It looks like Lee Yeon Seo, who was icy cold, who was like an empty and noisy gong, 

327
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:39,860
 is about to begin something.  

328
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:42,330
 Her beginnings will seem humble,  

329
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:46,990
 but her future will hold love. 

330
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:50,430
 I'm about to finish my mission. 

331
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:56,800
 But why is my heart aching so much? 

332
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,210
 Why are you crying? 

333
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,800
 Were you disappointed? 

334
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:26,360
 That was so pretty. 

335
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:30,070
 That was the prettiest thing I've ever seen. 

336
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:41,660


337
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:50,580
♫  Stars falling this night when I'm thinking of you alone  ♫

338
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:58,290
♫  Will you know I feel infatuated?  ♫

339
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:06,150
♫  On a night when cherry blossoms are scattering,  ♫

340
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:07,590
♫  Underneath the moonlight's  ♫

341
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:11,670
  
 ♫ Warm wind  ♫

342
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:13,370
 You're smiling brightly, aren't you? 

343
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:15,350
♫  If my heart touches you  ♫

344
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:16,320
 You look pretty. 

345
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,890
 Don't you think this is too much? 

346
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:22,150
 "She's very beautiful." "She was the prettiest."  

347
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,450
 It's true! 

348
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:26,620
 I'll fight with you. I want to see you become the center... 

349
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,220
 of Fantasia. 

350
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:32,000
 - Think about how the chandelier fell. 
- I'm feeling nervous. 

351
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,990
 You save me 

352
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:37,740
 and help me out, but why don't you like me? 

353
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:41,500
 How can I not like you? 

354
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,000
♫  I know that you're sick of this  ♫
