1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:03,080
Miss,

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,260
can't you just give up on everything?

3
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,730
I hate to see you suffer.

4
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:19,230
    
 You don't have to keep dancing  for Fantasia.

5
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:26,900
If you need an audience to dance to, I will watch you.

6
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:36,350
Should I? Should I give up on everything

7
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:40,760
and only show my dance to you, and live with you forever?

8
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:46,860


9
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,490
Kim Dan.

10
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,460
Yes, Miss.

11
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,850
Why do you always save me?

12
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,960
You save me

13
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,430
and help me out. But why don't you like me?

14
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:17,040
Figures. No one in this world likes me.

15
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,840
I don't care about that.

16
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,530
But it's not okay

17
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,290
for you to not like me. I hate it.

18
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,280
It's frustrating.

19
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:42,950
You said I'm good. You said I'm pretty. But...

20
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:47,830
But why don't you like me?

21
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,270
How can you not like me?

22
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,530
Kim Dan...

23
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:35,910
♫  I just fall in love today  ♫

24
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:42,680
♫  The love inside me  ♫

25
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,370
♫  ever since I met you  ♫

26
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,000
♫   I understood what love was  ♫

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,270
I shouldn't fall for you.

28
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:01,580
And I...

29
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,530
can't stay by your side forever.

30
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:09,030
That really breaks my heart.

31
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:15,890
Yeon Seo, how can I...

32
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:22,650
not like you?

33
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:30,650
♫  Because of you  ♫

34
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:37,660
♫  If you leave me, I’m broken in my heart because of you  ♫

35
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:43,900
 Don't go. Don't go. 

36
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:52,280
♫  Always be beside me  ♫

37
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,190
 How do you really feel? 

38
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:57,500
 Are you worried Rib isn't the real fate for her? 

39
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,300
 Or are you wishing that he isn't the real one? 

40
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,020
I'm in huge trouble, aren't I?

41
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:17,420
- What are you doing? 
- No, what's with you?

42
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:20,710
- Let go of me. Let go and talk.
- Don't dare to run away.

43
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:23,480
Tell me that you'll disappear from Yeon Seo's life at once.

44
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,760
What are you talking about suddenly?

45
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,930
I warned you, didn't I? That I wouldn't let you live if you interfered.

46
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:32,300
How dare you advise her to give up on dancing?

47
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,730
I said, let go!

48
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,510
I'm not really sure anymore.

49
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:58,250
 I thought I would know what humans were like if I took on their body, 

50
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,360
 but I guess not. 

51
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:05,120
 Why are humans like this? 

52
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,220
 When I like someone, why does my heart ache? 

53
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:12,300
 I know it's a vain hope, but why do I keep 

54
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,570
 wanting and wishing for more? 

55
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,670
 Why do humans love 

56
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,250
 in such a foolish way? 

57
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,930
You're awake.

58
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,060
He has a laceration on his arm.

59
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:12,100
Don't worry. It's not bad.

60
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,730
Ji Kang Woo. Where is Ji Kang Woo?

61
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:17,960
The guy I fell in with. Is he not out yet?

62
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,800
There's another man in the water. Keep searching.

63
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,700
Be quick. He's human and could die—

64
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:29,490
We'll look for the other person. Let's take you to the hospital first.

65
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,630
That person. Is it...

66
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:37,210
Who do you mean?

67
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,430
Will you keep still?

68
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,140
I'm okay. I'm perfectly fine.

69
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:51,230
You bled a lot. And just in case, we'll take some x-rays.

70
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:54,520
I'll heal right away. I swear.

71
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,510
Stay right here until it's your turn.

72
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,780
What's that I keep seeing?

73
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,620
It's not a dream or a prophecy.

74
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:28,670
It must have been Ji Kang Woo. I hope he's okay.

75
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:35,190
So, why did he lunge at me and grab me by the throat?

76
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:38,260
Why would a civilized person do that?

77
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,650
Did he...

78
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,230
 Can't you give up on everything? 

79
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,340
 Should I give up on everything, 

80
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:52,090
 and only show my dance to you, and live with you forever? 

81
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:54,020
Did he hear that?

82
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:59,320
If he did, does that justify what he did?

83
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,270
It does.

84
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:08,410
Telling a dancer to quit is like taking their life.

85
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,190
What do you mean?

86
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:13,220
After Yeon Seo went blind, do you know she tried to kill herself?

87
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:18,720
She just got her sight back and decided to dance again, and you told her to give up?

88
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,900
To quit? How dare you?

89
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,460
Who do you think you are to say such nonsense?

90
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:27,830
Quit your daydreaming. Yeon Seo's standing at the edge of a cliff.

91
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:32,290
Just one step and she plummets into the darkness. Don't push her!

92
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,000
That will be a fiery pit of hell to her.

93
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,130
I'm warning you for the last time. Resign and disappear tomorrow.

94
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:45,110
If not, first of all, I will...

95
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,850
toss you into a fiery pit of hell.

96
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,760
   

97
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,790
I won't disappear. I can't yet.

98
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:07,090
Why not? You pretended it wasn't, but is it because of your meager emotions?

99
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:09,530
Your sincerity and all that?

100
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,600
You're right. I like Yeon Seo.

101
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,250
I like her. Much more than I thought.

102
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,480
That's why I'm doing this. Because I want to see her happy.

103
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,330
You promised me.

104
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:27,980
That whatever you do, you'd do it for her happiness. Keep your word.

105
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:32,460
If you do that, I'll disappear.

106
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:37,530
I won't look back and will leave with a smile.

107
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:42,090
But if you give her a hard time over dance or anything,

108
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:44,830
then I will make you pay.

109
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,580
Do you understand?

110
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:18,260
I know better than anyone. I won't do anything.

111
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,990
I won't yearn for more.

112
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:22,440
Kim Dan, it's time for your x-ray--

113
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,840
What are you doing?

114
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,450
I'm fine now. I'll get going.

115
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:28,760
- Wait. 
- Sorry.

116
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,760
Wait. Wait.

117
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,490
Kim Dan.

118
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:36,790
Dear God, he is out of his mind.

119
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:42,260
Please ignore all the confessions from today.

120
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,940
Seol Hee.

121
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:19,050
 You said the world is full of dance. 

122
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,880
Why am I

123
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,780
like this, Seol Hee?

124
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:41,850
I thought it was done, that I was almost there.

125
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:45,030
He really gets on my nerves.

126
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:48,260
I can't stand him.

127
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:55,150
  Is it really he who's getting on your nerves? 

128
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:59,160
  What's making you waver? 

129
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:05,380
 Is it that man or is it your heart? 

130
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,370
Where's Ni Na?

131
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:26,440
Just one glass should do it.

132
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,460
Roo Na, shall we talk?

133
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,230
About what?

134
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,350
It's nothing.

135
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:38,560
Call the sponsors' association and have them gather by 9:00 a.m.

136
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,070
- Now? 
- Yes.

137
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:44,180
- Good Morning. 
- Morning.

138
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:50,070
Did you drink?

139
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:54,120
Do you smell it? Oh, dear. I showered two times and brushed three times.

140
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,320
You never drank alcohol. Why start now?

141
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,160
Is it because of Yeon Seo? Didn't you guys all boycott her from the ballet team?

142
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,180
Ballet members all agreed but the artistic director is being stubborn.

143
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,380
Drink this. You'll fell better.

144
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:12,730
It will all work out. Trust me and rest today.

145
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:25,170
Well, Mom, do you remember the first teacher who taught me ballet?

146
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:26,540
Who do you mean?

147
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:31,800
- You know, there was this teacher called Elena. 
- That lunatic?

148
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,960
Why talk about her out of the blue? She got kicked out long ago.

149
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:39,300
It's just that Yeon Seo's back, and I thought about my previous teacher.

150
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,910
A teacher? No way.

151
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:45,230
She threw red paint at an eight-year-old girl, telling her to imagine death.

152
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:48,790
And she dunked you in a bathtub so you could imagine the sea.

153
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:51,060
My goodness. She was completely out of her mind.

154
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,360
Ni Na, if someone asks, tell them you don't know her.

155
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,420
She never taught you, and you don't know her.

156
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:01,480
Nothing good will come from you being associated with her.

157
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:30,870
 I'll give you 12 hours. Resign on your own. 

158
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:35,750
 Telling a dancer to quit is like taking their life. 

159
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,810
How long were you there for?

160
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:56,060
For a while. You're pretty

161
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:59,460
as always when you dance.

162
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,640
That's a given.

163
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,740
Do I have about two hours left?

164
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,370
About what your aunt said yesterday.

165
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:11,160
- That's— 
- Miss!

166
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:16,630
Take it. It's the results of the blood test.

167
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:19,050
Didn't you say it's of no use? Did you find anything?

168
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,610
No.

169
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:23,870
If you're cornered, use this to bluff

170
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,950
that someone set you up and you're a victim.

171
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:29,360
If they push you, you'll reveal the results.

172
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,350
No. Just... Don't go.

173
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,910
The 12-hour deadline was unfair from the start.

174
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:37,230
You have no duty or responsibility to go by what they said.

175
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:41,470
And if I don't go, should I just give in without doing anything?

176
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:45,450
You know that General Director Choi is extraordinary.

177
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:48,660
I know that. I know that too well, which is why I am like this.

178
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:54,080
It's obvious what will happen. She'll nag at you to no end and force you to quit.

179
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:03,040
My goodness. She knew we were talking about her.

180
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,360
What do we do?

181
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,910
Let me answer it. She probably wants to talk to me.

182
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,470
- Yes, it's me. 
- Why aren't you answering my calls?

183
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:17,490
 I almost thought that you went into hiding because you were scared. 

184
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:20,880
 - Hello? Are you there?  
- Go on.

185
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,990
Your time is almost up. Are you coming or not?

186
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:27,390
 Everyone from the association is going to be there. 

187
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:31,270
 If you're not joining us, I'll speak on your behalf. I'll tell them you'll take full responsibility— 

188
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:34,220
Just wait. I'll be there on time.

189
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,120
You've made the right decision. People say that ending things on a good note is all that matters.

190
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:44,580
 It looks much better if you put an end to this mess without anyone's involvement. 

191
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,500
See you later then.

192
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,310
What did she say?

193
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,470
I must get going.

194
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:56,070
If things go south, just pretend that you fainted. Okay?

195
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:04,140
Kim Dan, why are you so quiet?

196
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:08,420
Aren't you going to ask what I'm going to do?

197
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,100
Hey, where are you going?

198
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,070
Kim Dan!

199
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:30,580
Why are we here?

200
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:44,090
Hey, what are you doing?

201
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:47,340
How did it feel when you fell into the water?

202
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:55,810
Wasn't it dark, suffocating,

203
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:59,060
scary, and lonely?

204
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,030
I know that, too.

205
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:10,610
Have you gone mad? What are you doing? You almost gave me a heart attack!

206
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,600
It's really unfortunate.

207
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,470
Had I known you at that time,

208
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,950
I would've stopped you

209
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:23,050
like you held my hand just now.

210
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,620
Actually, yesterday, this is what I told you.

211
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:33,400
I told you if it's too hard, you can give up.

212
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:39,090
- I don't remember that. 
 - I did tell you that. I told you to give up and have an easy life.

213
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:42,070
But that day at the beach

214
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:44,850
and in your studio this morning,

215
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,830
you were happy

216
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,270
for sure.

217
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:55,480
If you like dancing, go ahead,

218
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,330
and just keep this in mind.

219
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:04,850
Whatever you decide to do or wherever you are, you are no longer alone.

220
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,790
We'll be late. Let's hurry.

221
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:19,010
Wait up for me!

222
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,830
The sponsors' association is meeting at this time?

223
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,670
Everyone is in the conference room now.

224
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:34,450
General Director Choi called the meeting. I thought you should be informed, too.

225
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,990
   

226
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:42,130
Thank you.

227
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:43,610
 What on earth is going on there? 

228
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:48,030
Yesterday, you barged into my car and threatened me.

229
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:52,260
 It seems like you do business with Mr. Ishikawa secretly. 

230
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,780
 Would you like to pay taxes in both countries? 

231
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,880
 What do you want? 

232
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,850
 Maintaining the status quo. No more, no less. 

233
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:03,630
And today, General Director Choi called me at the crack of dawn,

234
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:06,320
because Yeon Seo will make an important announcement.

235
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,030
What did you say?

236
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,250
What are you doing?

237
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,870
Is this some kind of prank?

238
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:16,660
We will submit an official petition to dismiss you.

239
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:20,160
Ms. Lee Yeon Seo, you and I went over this together.

240
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,990
If you keep this up, you will ruin Fantasia.

241
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:44,450
I'm sorry.

242
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,980
I apologize for what happened that day.

243
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:57,240
I won't make any excuses.

244
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,170
I apologize.

245
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:06,300
Go on. What else?

246
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:09,220
Do you think that just saying sorry is enough?

247
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,710
Are you serious?

248
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,480
There's more.

249
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,880
Ms. Yeon Seo, do not be nervous. Just speak your mind.

250
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,460
Do you remember what we promised yesterday?

251
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:25,230
Do you remember what we were going to do for the future of Fantasia?

252
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,460
I know it's difficult.

253
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:42,560
Starting today, Ms. Yeon Seo decided to resign from the foundation and the ballet theatre.

254
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,330
No, I won't do that.

255
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,720
That's not true.

256
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,450
Are you telling us that you won't resign from both your positions?

257
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,220
Are you truly sorry?

258
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:55,130
I will show you with my performance. I'm sure you've suspected me since that day.

259
00:21:55,130 --> 00:22:00,710
I will show you that I'm not mentally unstable and that I'm perfectly sane.

260
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,950
This all has to be worth something.

261
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:10,240
It has to be worthy of the money which we earned with our blood and sweat.

262
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,210
If you're going to apologize, you can kneel down and put everything to rest.

263
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:18,090
It's clear and sincere.

264
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:24,920
I see. Kneel down? Sincerity?

265
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,710
It's that.

266
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,700
Do you like ballet?

267
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:54,100
What's your favorite show? What's your favorite role?

268
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:58,240
Do you know how many dancers we have in our ballet theatre?

269
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:02,570
You were in the middle of your apology. What nonsense are you gibbering about?

270
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:06,750
You don't like ballet, right?

271
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,640
You know those people in the association?

272
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:18,410
They are ignorant, but they want to look sophisticated and believe that they could buy taste with money.

273
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:25,730
They sit in the best seat and doze off. Those annoying snobs.

274
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,360
Lee Yeon Seo!

275
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,060
Were you just talking about us?

276
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,970
I'll make you like it.

277
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:39,560
Ballet. I'll make you love ballet.

278
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,880
That will be worth your money.

279
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,050
If this show, "Giselle," isn't a success, I will resign from

280
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:50,570
the ballet theatre and Fantasia Foundation.

281
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:53,190
Isn't this enough to suffice as your answer?

282
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:56,380
We will extend General Director Choi's power of attorney until the day of the show.

283
00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:01,710
After the show, we'll choose which one of us will leave Fantasia.

284
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:04,400
This is all. Bye.

285
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:32,280
Ms. Lee.

286
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,300
Good job.

287
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:43,250
Let's come up with the best show and make them kneel down.

288
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,220
I'll do my best.

289
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,290
Lee Yeon Seo!

290
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:51,310
Let's talk.

291
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:02,290
You, are you toying with me?

292
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:03,890
Do you think I'm a joke?

293
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:06,580
How could you con me every chance you get?

294
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:10,860
How did we get here?

295
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:16,100
Because of this?

296
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:19,340
Do you want it?

297
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,750
Don't patronize me.

298
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:24,000
You think I'm greedy for money?

299
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,550
If I was greedy for money, I would have sold this off ages ago

300
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:30,890
while you were away in Russia and while you were blind.

301
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:34,540
I was the one who grew Fantasia.

302
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:37,460
It was me who worked for a decade to bring

303
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:40,750
Fantasia to where it is now after your parents passed away.

304
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:44,290
I had to flatter those ministers and play nice with the sponsors.

305
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:46,200
And it was me who built this foundation up.

306
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,130
How does this belong to you when I did all the hard work?

307
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:53,790
Since when did you start to covet Fantasia?

308
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:57,760
Was it when my father took you and your husband in because you had nowhere else to go?

309
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,460
Or was it when my parents passed away? Did you think it would be easy since I was young and alone?

310
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,670
Did you begin to get greedy?

311
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:08,110
Stop denouncing me. You don't even know anything.

312
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,390
If that's not it,

313
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:12,730
did you get delusional and begin to think that it's yours because

314
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:16,330
the only successor is now blind? Did you ever

315
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:22,240
feel bad for me as your family, even once?

316
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:31,110
If you hadn't done something like this,

317
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:35,270
today, I would have...

318
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:39,060
No. I would have put everything down ages ago.

319
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,440
You're using me as an excuse to the very end.

320
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,660
I'll also show you that I am worthy of this.

321
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,240
Fine, I'll look forward

322
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,660
to seeing your "Giselle," although you won't have corps de ballet or a partner.

323
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,310
How is your arm?

324
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,980
Well, I'm fine now.

325
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:15,190
So, when will you quit?

326
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:20,020
You saw her. No matter what you say, she said she'd make you love her ballet.

327
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,710
That's what a ballerina is.

328
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:25,320
Someone who stands by herself on a huge stage.

329
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,630
She doesn't need a cheeky secretary.

330
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:34,570
In that aspect, you really didn't do anything either.

331
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:38,760
Yeon Seo resolved this all alone.

332
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,900
I couldn't tell you before because I was out of it,

333
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:46,500
but you can't just go down a fiery pit when some whimsical man sends you there.

334
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,290
I can't explain this in detail,

335
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:51,450
but especially someone like me can't go to that place.

336
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:53,460
Keep that in your mind.

337
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,840
Where are the corps?

338
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,530
I know they're on strike. I'll go talk to them.

339
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:00,790
That's not necessary.

340
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:06,300
They aren't striking against you, Yeon Seo. It's a strike against the decision that I made as an artistic director.

341
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,340
I'll take care of this.

342
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:11,270
It's because of me. So, I'll go and—

343
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:13,240
   

344
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:19,840
This is Ji Kang Woo. Where are you right now?

345
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,150
Let us tell you what our demand is.

346
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,800
First.

347
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,560
 Retract your decision to make Lee Yeon Seo our lead. 

348
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,740
 Second. 

349
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,370
Please put an end to your dogmatic leadership.

350
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,290
Is that all? I will answer you immediately.

351
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:37,230
First, I will not retract anything.

352
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:41,760
Second,  if you don't show up at the practice at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow, you'll be fired. 

353
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,530
Director Ji.

354
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:45,560
We can just get new dancers.

355
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,830
 People line up to join out theatre as a member of a dance group. 

356
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:54,050
 I don't wish to create a performance with corps  
who do not trust me, who need to be humored to work.

357
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:56,800
 Tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. It's the last chance I can give you as a director. 

358
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,560
 That's all. 

359
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,540
 - What if I get fired? 
- Do we have to go? 

360
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:07,340
What were you thinking?

361
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:10,850
I'm giving them an opportunity. They can use this as an excuse to return.

362
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:14,180
How can I perform with people who return reluctantly?

363
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,290
I know that you're trying very hard for my sake.

364
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:18,470
Even so, this isn't right.

365
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:19,590
What do you expect me to do?

366
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:22,900
You can do things your way.

367
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,450
I'll try my best, too.

368
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:27,150
Let's go.

369
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:33,930
Those who oppress

370
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:38,050
the righteous person and deprive the poor

371
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:41,930
have many faults and a grave sin.

372
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,870
Should I give Ni Na a call?

373
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:03,640
Ni Na is a good person, so she'll help you out.

374
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,080
   

375
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:15,040
Yes, Dan. What is it?

376
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,190
 It's me, Yeon Seo. 

377
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,700
If you're calling about the ballet theatre, I can't tell you anything.

378
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,400
I'm not asking you to persuade them.

379
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,910
Just tell me where you are.

380
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,790
Please.

381
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:35,210
I never asked you for a favor before.

382
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:37,740
Please don't put me in a tight spot. I'm hanging up.

383
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:41,060
 I thought you wanted to fight fair and square. 

384
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:44,130
You came to my house and told me

385
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:46,760
to return my old self because you wanted to compete with me.

386
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:50,390
 If you push me away even before we begin,  
how could we ever know who won?

387
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:55,833
