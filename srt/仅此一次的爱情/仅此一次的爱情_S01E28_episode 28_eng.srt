1
00:00:00,777 --> 00:00:01,877
All reservations are canceled?
   

2
00:00:01,877 --> 00:00:04,027
- Yes. They are canceling them now. 
 - All right.

3
00:00:04,027 --> 00:00:05,127
Try calling them again.

4
00:00:05,127 --> 00:00:06,897
Excuse me.  This...

5
00:00:06,897 --> 00:00:08,327
How many cancellations did we get?

6
00:00:08,327 --> 00:00:10,617
I'll check the system again.

7
00:00:10,617 --> 00:00:12,837
This is the first time we've faced a massive cancellation a week before a performance.

8
00:00:12,837 --> 00:00:15,387
We are also trying to find a solution.

9
00:00:16,607 --> 00:00:20,037
Call the reporters. Immediately.

10
00:00:20,037 --> 00:00:23,357
Will you really not say anything about this incident?

11
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,547
Once we take care of things, we will have an exclusive interview.

12
00:00:25,547 --> 00:00:27,007
Sorry for the wait.

13
00:00:27,007 --> 00:00:29,477
From the violent incident to the ticket refunds,

14
00:00:29,477 --> 00:00:31,417
how are you going to overcome this crisis?

15
00:00:31,417 --> 00:00:33,497
This is not a crisis, but rather an opportunity.

16
00:00:33,497 --> 00:00:36,997
A chance to see the recovered Lee Yeon Seo as Giselle.

17
00:00:36,997 --> 00:00:41,107
Instead of "Lee Yeon Seo's Giselle," please write it as "Fantasia's Giselle."

18
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:43,907
Each member of our corps is magnificent,

19
00:00:43,907 --> 00:00:45,467
and everyone is a main character.

20
00:00:45,467 --> 00:00:47,847
We will encompass all of our dancer's skills and efforts

21
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:51,017
to present a splendid performance.

22
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:54,007
Isn't it useless if the audience is empty?

23
00:00:54,007 --> 00:00:56,647
I plan to invite special guests.

24
00:00:56,647 --> 00:00:59,587
People who have never seen ballet once since they were born,

25
00:00:59,587 --> 00:01:02,537
we will give those people a beautiful present.

26
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:09,717
It was a good idea.

27
00:01:09,717 --> 00:01:14,577
Managing the media conference and planning to show a ballet to people who haven't seen it before.

28
00:01:15,687 --> 00:01:17,937
Why are you avoiding me?

29
00:01:17,937 --> 00:01:19,787
You aren't answering my calls.

30
00:01:19,787 --> 00:01:21,787
Why are you avoiding me after dropping the bomb?

31
00:01:21,787 --> 00:01:25,947
That's the limit to what I can do.

32
00:01:25,947 --> 00:01:27,787
   

33
00:01:35,267 --> 00:01:36,697
What is this?

34
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:38,757
We're getting married.

35
00:01:42,207 --> 00:01:47,937
 We will be together for good. 

36
00:01:47,937 --> 00:01:49,527
 Do you have to invite him? 

37
00:01:49,527 --> 00:01:51,837
 I don't like him. 

38
00:01:53,047 --> 00:01:56,497
 I think this will be the answer. 

39
00:01:57,387 --> 00:02:00,137
We're going to live happily,
     

40
00:02:00,137 --> 00:02:02,207
day by day.

41
00:02:02,207 --> 00:02:05,257
This is my answer to you.

42
00:02:07,077 --> 00:02:09,507
Ms. Yeon Seo, you're...

43
00:02:09,507 --> 00:02:11,777
You're out of your mind. Marriage?

44
00:02:11,777 --> 00:02:15,277
I told you Kim Dan will dissipate soon. He's reaching the end.

45
00:02:15,277 --> 00:02:18,647
Do you think I told you out of joy?

46
00:02:18,647 --> 00:02:22,097
I had to tell you because it's obvious that you will be shocked and hurt,

47
00:02:22,097 --> 00:02:24,577
because I wanted to protect you.

48
00:02:26,967 --> 00:02:29,117
This is interesting.

49
00:02:29,117 --> 00:02:32,007
You told me so I would stop.

50
00:02:32,007 --> 00:02:36,747
Because of what you said I wanted to marry him.

51
00:02:36,747 --> 00:02:38,677
Fine.

52
00:02:38,677 --> 00:02:42,987
Now, it's going to burn up even more, just like with Romeo and Juliet.

53
00:02:42,987 --> 00:02:44,857
But you know what?

54
00:02:44,857 --> 00:02:47,757
The love between Romeo and Juliet happened for only five days?

55
00:02:47,757 --> 00:02:50,037
It's short-lived and you will get over it.

56
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:53,217
Please don't put a lot at stake.

57
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:56,467
For five days?

58
00:02:57,697 --> 00:03:01,777
Someone can live for the rest of her life with the love of five days.

59
00:03:01,777 --> 00:03:05,757
You understand that the best.

60
00:03:07,247 --> 00:03:10,077
I will ask you for the last time.

61
00:03:10,077 --> 00:03:12,707
For Dan to become a human,

62
00:03:13,617 --> 00:03:16,577
is there really no way?

63
00:03:18,047 --> 00:03:19,387
Whatever it is, please tell me!

64
00:03:19,387 --> 00:03:21,667
I wish there was even one thing I could do.

65
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:25,407
If I can exchange anything for his life, I will do anything—

66
00:03:25,407 --> 00:03:27,087
Stop!

67
00:03:27,087 --> 00:03:30,747
Stop it. Seo Ri died because she was feeling exactly the same thing.

68
00:03:30,747 --> 00:03:33,137
Don't put anything at stake. Don't throw anything away.

69
00:03:33,137 --> 00:03:36,627
Do you think Kim Dan will want to become human in a world where you don't exist?

70
00:03:36,627 --> 00:03:39,397
That's not a price but rather a punishment.

71
00:03:51,817 --> 00:03:53,777
I'll leave.

72
00:03:56,517 --> 00:03:58,327
Ms. Yeon Seo.

73
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:04,177
You said she was Seori?

74
00:04:04,857 --> 00:04:09,627
I think she would be really sad even after she died.

75
00:04:10,857 --> 00:04:14,057
The person she sacrificed her life for

76
00:04:15,767 --> 00:04:20,457
thinks that he is being punished and is living in hell.

77
00:04:25,537 --> 00:04:27,787
I...

78
00:04:27,787 --> 00:04:30,227
We won't be like that.

79
00:04:30,227 --> 00:04:32,207
I'll make sure of that.

80
00:04:32,207 --> 00:04:38,357
♫   I can say anything that I want, when I want ♫ 

81
00:04:38,357 --> 00:04:44,607
♫   I believe in things that I see, I pray ♫ 

82
00:04:44,607 --> 00:04:47,177
♫   I don't know if I can anymore ♫ 

83
00:04:47,177 --> 00:04:50,257
 No. That's just fiction. It's all made up. 

84
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:52,917
 My body will be torn up when it's not even raining. 

85
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:56,057
 You will heal anyway. Let's just try it. 

86
00:04:56,057 --> 00:04:57,447
  That's not it.  

87
00:04:57,447 --> 00:04:59,797
  Then what? Do you know a way?  

88
00:04:59,797 --> 00:05:03,597
♫   That was a while ago ♫ 

89
00:05:03,597 --> 00:05:06,737
  Can't you not die? Must that be the only way?  

90
00:05:06,737 --> 00:05:08,247
  What are you saying?  

91
00:05:08,247 --> 00:05:10,447
  Giselle dies so that Act 2 can start.  

92
00:05:10,447 --> 00:05:12,357
 That way she can save Albrecht. 

93
00:05:12,357 --> 00:05:16,047
 That's not it. I don't think that's what he wanted. 

94
00:05:16,047 --> 00:05:18,977
 Don't be too absorbed in the story. It's not me who will die anyway. 

95
00:05:18,977 --> 00:05:20,847
No way.

96
00:05:29,987 --> 00:05:32,627
You come in without permission now?

97
00:05:32,627 --> 00:05:36,017
The boundary has broken down too much.

98
00:05:36,017 --> 00:05:39,987
What do I have to do? What do I have to do to save Dan?

99
00:05:40,027 --> 00:05:42,847
If I give up my life or my sight in front of God,

100
00:05:42,847 --> 00:05:45,577
will I be able to save Dan?

101
00:05:45,577 --> 00:05:48,207
Tell me! Tell me everything.

102
00:05:48,207 --> 00:05:51,307
Then I will be sincerely thankful to God.

103
00:05:55,157 --> 00:05:57,227
Humans are beings that want to live.

104
00:05:57,227 --> 00:06:00,507
They can't give up their life that easily.

105
00:06:00,507 --> 00:06:02,717
How do you know that if even I don't know?

106
00:06:02,717 --> 00:06:05,167
I can do anything! I can give up anything!

107
00:06:05,167 --> 00:06:09,007
That day, you said you wanted to live.

108
00:06:10,097 --> 00:06:13,547
 Please help us. 

109
00:06:15,247 --> 00:06:17,587
 I want to live. 

110
00:06:17,587 --> 00:06:22,647
 I've been wanting to die every day, but now I want to live. 

111
00:06:23,597 --> 00:06:27,617
 For the crime of saving a girl who wanted to live, 

112
00:06:27,617 --> 00:06:33,157
 it is given for him to be punished by dissipating. 

113
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:38,477
Because he saved me,

114
00:06:38,477 --> 00:06:39,897
he needs to die?

115
00:06:39,897 --> 00:06:41,867
I also wanted to save him.

116
00:06:41,867 --> 00:06:43,887
I wanted to send Dan to Heaven.

117
00:06:43,887 --> 00:06:50,067
But there is no way to change the end that was decided.

118
00:06:56,647 --> 00:06:59,697
No, I will change it.

119
00:07:00,467 --> 00:07:04,487
I will save Dan.

120
00:07:04,487 --> 00:07:06,487
Keep your eyes on me.

121
00:07:19,707 --> 00:07:22,497
Why are you standing there?

122
00:07:22,497 --> 00:07:25,847
Go. Ni Na is waiting at home.

123
00:07:25,847 --> 00:07:27,767
She came back?

124
00:07:35,327 --> 00:07:38,247
I did wrong, Ni Na.

125
00:07:38,247 --> 00:07:39,977
So please forgive me once.

126
00:07:39,977 --> 00:07:43,387
It's my fault. I was a coward.

127
00:07:43,387 --> 00:07:46,167
Looking back, I was hiding and acting

128
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:49,257
like a nice person behind Mom, Dad, and Sis.

129
00:07:49,257 --> 00:07:51,387
It's all because of me.

130
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:54,277
Then, you're moving back in. Right?

131
00:07:54,277 --> 00:07:58,157
No. I will be living alone from now on.

132
00:07:58,157 --> 00:08:01,807
From today on, I don't have such a thing as a family.

133
00:08:01,807 --> 00:08:04,487
I came here to tell you that.

134
00:08:08,687 --> 00:08:10,517
Goodbye.

135
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:17,477
What's wrong with you?

136
00:08:19,007 --> 00:08:23,127
- Why are you doing this? 
 - Stay still instead of causing more trouble.

137
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:27,417
You're leaving to make yourself feel better after cutting ties with your family?

138
00:08:27,417 --> 00:08:30,257
Since when did you start to think?

139
00:08:31,947 --> 00:08:36,167
What was I to you?

140
00:08:38,067 --> 00:08:40,017
I love you.

141
00:08:40,017 --> 00:08:42,137
I loved you my way.

142
00:08:42,137 --> 00:08:45,017
That love is wrong.

143
00:08:45,017 --> 00:08:46,447
I won't receive it any longer.

144
00:08:46,447 --> 00:08:48,857
- Geum Ni Na. 
 - Sis,

145
00:08:49,527 --> 00:08:51,137
I liked you a lot.

146
00:08:51,137 --> 00:08:54,917
You were cool, strong, and always by my side.

147
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:58,207
Don't even say hello to me even when we pass by on the street.

148
00:09:08,767 --> 00:09:10,857
I won't leave you alone.

149
00:09:22,357 --> 00:09:24,277
- Ta-da. 
 - What is this?

150
00:09:24,277 --> 00:09:27,167
We have to write our vows so I prepared this.

151
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:28,267
Now?

152
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:31,327
Yes. Here.

153
00:09:32,937 --> 00:09:34,597
Pen.

154
00:09:34,597 --> 00:09:38,087
♫  I just fall in   ♫

155
00:09:38,087 --> 00:09:41,487
Here, use this.

156
00:09:43,297 --> 00:09:45,117
Stay still.

157
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:53,467
♫  Although I try to hide my excitement  ♫

158
00:09:53,487 --> 00:09:58,737
♫  My eyes only see  ♫

159
00:09:58,737 --> 00:10:04,487
♫  one person. Because of you  ♫

160
00:10:09,387 --> 00:10:11,927
♫  you, if you leave me  ♫

161
00:10:11,927 --> 00:10:14,927
♫  I’m broken in my heart  ♫

162
00:10:14,927 --> 00:10:22,857
♫  because of you you  ♫

163
00:10:22,857 --> 00:10:29,057
I am telling you now. I will have a baby as late as possible since I need to do ballet.

164
00:10:30,847 --> 00:10:33,367
That can't happen.

165
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:36,987
We need to hurry since I want ten sons and daughters.

166
00:10:37,927 --> 00:10:40,287
Dream on.

167
00:10:40,287 --> 00:10:47,027
It will be perfect if we had a daughter that resembles you and a son like me.

168
00:10:47,027 --> 00:10:52,427
♫  I fell into your world  ♫

169
00:10:52,427 --> 00:10:56,057
Will it be okay if our son has a personality similar to yours?

170
00:10:56,057 --> 00:10:58,797
For his future...

171
00:10:58,797 --> 00:11:00,567
Hey.

172
00:11:00,567 --> 00:11:02,167
Why do you always hit me?

173
00:11:02,167 --> 00:11:03,747
What's wrong with my personality?

174
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:05,777
I mean, think about it. I'm right.

175
00:11:05,777 --> 00:11:07,767
If our son has your personality...

176
00:11:16,547 --> 00:11:18,107
Mom.

177
00:11:18,107 --> 00:11:20,147
Dad.

178
00:11:21,357 --> 00:11:23,387
Mister.

179
00:11:26,097 --> 00:11:30,447
He's my groom-to-be.

180
00:11:34,447 --> 00:11:37,227
Hello, I'm Kim Dan.

181
00:11:37,227 --> 00:11:39,517
I give you my greetings.

182
00:11:42,737 --> 00:11:45,957
Thanks for sending me this person.

183
00:11:47,087 --> 00:11:52,337
When we meet, I'll greet you again.

184
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:57,727
When I came here for the first time, I heard from Yeon Seo.

185
00:11:57,727 --> 00:12:04,297
I am the person who exists for her and my goal in life is her.

186
00:12:04,297 --> 00:12:08,217
I will make sure to follow those words.

187
00:12:08,217 --> 00:12:17,457
Even though I'm not a human, I will do my best to make her happy as if one day is equal to one thousand years.

188
00:12:21,217 --> 00:12:23,137
I'm sorry.

189
00:12:25,057 --> 00:12:26,657
Why are you sorry?

190
00:12:26,657 --> 00:12:33,317
I'm sorry for not being able to stay next to her for a long time even if I want to.

191
00:12:34,037 --> 00:12:38,897
Instead, I will make sure our Yeon Seo

192
00:12:38,897 --> 00:12:44,297
is living happily even after I leave.

193
00:12:45,157 --> 00:12:47,127
Please watch over her.

194
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:01,457
Yeon Seo.

195
00:13:01,457 --> 00:13:02,887
Let's divorce.

196
00:13:02,887 --> 00:13:04,067
We haven't even gotten married.

197
00:13:04,067 --> 00:13:05,987
We decided to not be like that.

198
00:13:05,987 --> 00:13:11,907
We decided to live together forever and have ten kids. That's what we promised.

199
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:17,137
Yeon Seo, listen carefully.

200
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:22,287
I will probably disappear like dust.

201
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:28,827
As if I never existed. That will probably happen.

202
00:13:30,137 --> 00:13:32,877
No, don't say that. That won't happen.

203
00:13:32,877 --> 00:13:38,337
Even when I'm not here, you need to

204
00:13:38,337 --> 00:13:40,587
live courageously and beautifully.

205
00:13:41,497 --> 00:13:43,777
Can you promise that?

206
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:54,467
Please, Yeon Seo.

207
00:13:54,467 --> 00:14:01,127
I can't marry you if you get unhappy after my leaving.

208
00:14:02,437 --> 00:14:04,997
You should also make that promise.

209
00:14:05,937 --> 00:14:11,257
People don't know whether you'll disappear or I'll die first.

210
00:14:11,257 --> 00:14:13,397
We don't know that.

211
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:18,937
That won't happen. Never.

212
00:14:18,937 --> 00:14:21,127
Of course. So just promise.

213
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:27,707
Whoever gets left behind makes sure to live well and happily.

214
00:14:30,627 --> 00:14:32,347
Come on.

215
00:14:58,787 --> 00:15:00,567
Why so suddenly?

216
00:15:01,477 --> 00:15:05,237
It was a lot of work, right? Cheer up.

217
00:15:57,397 --> 00:16:01,087
So? What do you want?

218
00:16:01,087 --> 00:16:05,727
He said she didn't say anything yet. She just gave him money whenever she met him.

219
00:16:05,727 --> 00:16:06,847
Then, immediately tell the poli—

220
00:16:06,847 --> 00:16:09,327
We still don't have anything.

221
00:16:09,327 --> 00:16:11,747
Keep meeting her without letting her know for now.

222
00:16:11,747 --> 00:16:14,067
Would that be okay?

223
00:16:14,067 --> 00:16:19,027
Please report to Ji Kang Woo.

224
00:16:19,027 --> 00:16:21,947
You can go now. Take care of yourself.

225
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:23,567
All right.

226
00:16:28,657 --> 00:16:32,257
What makes you trust him? What if he tells Geum Roo Na on us?

227
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:34,827
I hope that happens. That way, she will stop.

228
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,257
She won't change.

229
00:16:36,257 --> 00:16:39,517
She may just hire another person or change the method.

230
00:16:39,517 --> 00:16:40,947
I know.

231
00:16:40,947 --> 00:16:45,587
That's why I put you in charge of that person.

232
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:49,937
I'll be in charge of Geum Roo Na.

233
00:16:52,567 --> 00:16:55,167
What do you mean by you are taking charge of her?

234
00:16:58,027 --> 00:16:58,767
You don't need to know.

235
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:02,057
Are you... You're not, right?

236
00:17:02,057 --> 00:17:04,137
You shouldn't interfere with human matters.

237
00:17:04,137 --> 00:17:07,127
I shouldn't love a human, either.

238
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:11,007
I am not scared of anything since I already broke the rules.

239
00:17:12,117 --> 00:17:14,127
You said this before.

240
00:17:14,127 --> 00:17:18,797
You can kill someone for the sake of Lee Yeon Seo.

241
00:17:21,527 --> 00:17:23,027
Don't be like that.

242
00:17:23,027 --> 00:17:24,757
Live.

243
00:17:24,757 --> 00:17:29,247
Live and stay by Yeon Seo's side.

244
00:17:29,247 --> 00:17:31,797
What gibberish are talking about?

245
00:17:31,797 --> 00:17:33,687
Ballet.

246
00:17:35,517 --> 00:17:39,197
Do that with Yeon Seo.

247
00:17:39,197 --> 00:17:44,387
Make it so that Yeon Seo can shine the most.

248
00:17:47,127 --> 00:17:48,927
I ask that of you.

249
00:17:56,667 --> 00:17:58,987
Humans are beings that want to live.

250
00:17:58,987 --> 00:18:01,887
People can't give up their life that easily.

251
00:18:12,177 --> 00:18:16,267
You're here? Warm up your body.

252
00:18:16,267 --> 00:18:19,137
I handed in my resignation letter.

253
00:18:19,137 --> 00:18:22,197
I can't shamelessly continue to dance.

254
00:18:22,197 --> 00:18:24,597
Didn't you hear what I said?

255
00:18:27,487 --> 00:18:30,247
I want you to watch over me as your punishment.

256
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,267
What are you doing?

257
00:18:32,267 --> 00:18:33,857
You should practice.

258
00:18:33,857 --> 00:18:37,287
If you don't do it, who will dance Giselle?

259
00:18:37,977 --> 00:18:41,777
You... Is there something going on?

260
00:18:41,777 --> 00:18:45,207
I'm doing this just in case. What's the purpose of an understudy?

261
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:49,967
You have to practice so you can take my place at any time and for me to take it easy on the stage.

262
00:18:53,067 --> 00:18:58,447
I wish for it to be you.

263
00:19:00,157 --> 00:19:02,457
What are you doing? Change your clothes.

264
00:20:32,827 --> 00:20:35,047
Did you drink?

265
00:20:36,067 --> 00:20:38,757
I am sorry to let you come alone.

266
00:20:39,957 --> 00:20:44,737
I'm sorry I  had to practice until the day before the wedding.

267
00:20:44,737 --> 00:20:46,717
Did you finish?

268
00:20:48,907 --> 00:20:54,087
I really wanted to see your performance.

269
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:59,847
I really wanted to see you dance on stage.

270
00:21:03,327 --> 00:21:05,387
You can watch it.

271
00:21:06,197 --> 00:21:10,747
Of course. I can just do that.

272
00:21:24,627 --> 00:21:26,227
Pay attention.

273
00:21:26,227 --> 00:21:27,997
Move it a bit this way.

274
00:21:27,997 --> 00:21:29,787
Oh, that's good.  Good.

275
00:21:29,787 --> 00:21:31,617
You should match it up with this.

276
00:21:31,617 --> 00:21:33,187
Wait a bit.

277
00:21:33,187 --> 00:21:35,117
Turn it around.

278
00:21:35,117 --> 00:21:36,947
Stop. Stop. There. Okay. Good.

279
00:21:36,947 --> 00:21:38,507
Wait a minute. Wait.

280
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:39,657
No. Rotate it.

281
00:21:39,657 --> 00:21:41,367
Like this. Try rotating it.

282
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:45,147
Yeah. Yes. That's good.

283
00:21:50,487 --> 00:21:53,117
Don't be nervous.

284
00:21:57,037 --> 00:21:58,857
Can you tell?

285
00:22:03,937 --> 00:22:08,707
Gureum, you have to live long.

286
00:22:10,427 --> 00:22:13,657
Take care of Yeon Seo.

287
00:22:21,747 --> 00:22:23,207
We didn't order a cake.

288
00:22:23,207 --> 00:22:24,857
Let's see.

289
00:22:24,857 --> 00:22:29,527
It was sent by Angel Who.

290
00:22:34,207 --> 00:22:36,277
Surprise.

291
00:22:51,847 --> 00:22:55,907
I know you are working hard but play hooky for today.

292
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:58,087
The weather is nice.

293
00:23:01,337 --> 00:23:05,347
Look at this. The sky is clear and the sun is shining.

294
00:23:05,347 --> 00:23:07,797
I can't give my blessings.

295
00:23:09,497 --> 00:23:17,077
Because of you, I did a lot of deeds. If I did that, I felt like I would be punished.

296
00:23:23,757 --> 00:23:26,477
I don't know.

297
00:23:26,477 --> 00:23:31,777
I still can't understand your silly decision.

298
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:38,167
However, keep going forward.

299
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,547
As far as you can.

300
00:23:44,417 --> 00:23:48,137
I think today is the last day.

301
00:23:49,317 --> 00:23:51,887
Thanks.

302
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,887
This punk.

303
00:23:55,887 --> 00:23:59,447
You look cool. Straighten your shoulders.

We will happily love each other as if we are one, as if one day is like forever.

323
00:26:07,157 --> 00:26:12,557
We are each other's beginning and ending.

♫  Even when  ♫

 We believe in fate.

 Actually, we don't believe in it.

Are you going somewhere?

345
00:27:42,807 --> 00:27:44,747
You're awake?

346
00:27:47,597 --> 00:27:51,117
You were only looking at my face even early in the morning?

347
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:56,657
You were looking at me when I was sleeping as well.

348
00:28:27,037 --> 00:28:29,047
Hi.

349
00:28:30,707 --> 00:28:33,137
Come back safely.

350
00:28:39,637 --> 00:28:41,707
I'll be back.

351
00:29:49,347 --> 00:29:51,427
Goodbye...

352
00:29:52,517 --> 00:29:54,447
Dan.

353
00:30:11,057 --> 00:30:13,187
Yes. Call her now.

354
00:30:13,187 --> 00:30:15,397
Tell her to go there.

355
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:40,717
Hello. I'm Lee Yeon Seo.

356
00:30:41,427 --> 00:30:45,587
You know me, right? You can't possibly not know me.

357
00:30:45,587 --> 00:30:49,657
You should know me if you think of what you did to me.

358
00:30:49,657 --> 00:30:56,047
You turned a seven-year-old girl into an orphan and You made her lose her sight when she was a dancer, and You took her one and only Mister away.

359
00:30:56,887 --> 00:31:02,027
Even my left-over family are eager to kill me.

360
00:31:02,847 --> 00:31:05,267
Don't you think you're too harsh on me?

361
00:31:05,267 --> 00:31:09,417
But I didn't come here to resent that.

362
00:31:09,417 --> 00:31:13,067
I'm fine despite what you did because you sent Dan to me.

363
00:31:13,067 --> 00:31:15,707
I'm fine with it,

364
00:31:17,257 --> 00:31:19,807
but you can't do that to Dan.

365
00:31:19,807 --> 00:31:24,937
I'm angry that you killed him so hastily and horrifically. What did he do wrong?

366
00:31:24,937 --> 00:31:28,527
If you gave him a mission to teach me love, I love Dan.

367
00:31:28,527 --> 00:31:31,427
I don't know what kind of great love you want...

368
00:31:31,427 --> 00:31:35,997
Kim Dan. I love him.

369
00:31:35,997 --> 00:31:41,117
But why does he have to dissipate?

370
00:31:41,957 --> 00:31:47,187
If you have a conscience, you shouldn't be like this. You can't be like this!

371
00:32:10,307 --> 00:32:12,927
You like being fair?

372
00:32:13,857 --> 00:32:18,627
If you take one, you give one.

373
00:32:20,137 --> 00:32:21,927
Right?

374
00:32:48,107 --> 00:32:54,267
♫  The lives we play behind the mask  ♫

375
00:32:54,267 --> 00:32:58,237
I'm surprised. You tricked me.

376
00:32:58,237 --> 00:32:59,797
I told you before.

377
00:32:59,797 --> 00:33:06,737
If you try a stupid thing, I will stop you.

♫  To those who seek to change  ♫

379

 I am no longer curious.

♫  Away from all we’ve got  ♫

383
00:33:32,167 --> 00:33:35,527
 For the sake of the person I want to save, 

384
00:33:35,527 --> 00:33:37,007
 you need to kill someone.

♫  I can say anything that I want  ♫

386

 I will do it gladly.

if I can only save that person.
