00:01:37,561 --> 00:01:38,581
     

2
00:01:42,851 --> 00:01:50,861


3
00:02:10,181 --> 00:02:12,291
What's going on? Why isn't he coming?

4
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:24,001
♫   One, two, a one, two, three, four   ♫

5
00:02:24,001 --> 00:02:25,071
Did you sleep well?

6
00:02:25,071 --> 00:02:29,111
You're late. I told you to come within one minute of the bell.

7
00:02:29,111 --> 00:02:34,301
♫   I will never forget the way you   ♫

8
00:02:34,301 --> 00:02:38,891
Stand on the right. Give you my left arm. Correct?

9
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:40,291
Look at you...

10
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:43,351
I will serve you with my best as if this were my first time.

11
00:02:43,351 --> 00:02:44,211
You're acting up.

12
00:02:44,211 --> 00:02:46,681
Well, if you don't want to, then never mind.

13
00:02:46,681 --> 00:02:49,981
♫   if you'd stay with me   ♫

14
00:02:49,981 --> 00:02:53,071
♫   Oh, wouldn't it be better ♫ 

15
00:02:53,071 --> 00:02:54,541
Who said I didn't want to?

16
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,711
♫   if we could decide to ♫ 

17
00:02:57,711 --> 00:03:00,471
Last night...

18
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:04,971
You remember it, right?

19
00:03:04,971 --> 00:03:10,991
♫   Oh-oh-oh, something to show, show that you love me   ♫

20
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:17,771
♫   I want something sweeter.  You see,   ♫

21
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:20,921
♫   Something to show, show that you love me   ♫

22
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:23,471
You got your hopes up, didn't you?

23
00:03:28,161 --> 00:03:31,621
Hey, Lee Yeon Seo! If I catch you—

24
00:03:31,621 --> 00:03:34,361
- You'll what?
 - Don't run. If I catch you—

25
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:37,701
♫   sweeter, oh-oh-oh   ♫

26
00:03:37,701 --> 00:03:42,211
If you catch me, then what? What? What will you do?

27
00:03:42,211 --> 00:03:49,101
♫   I want something sweeter.  You see,   ♫

28
00:03:49,101 --> 00:03:52,681
♫   Something to show, show that you love me   ♫

29
00:03:52,681 --> 00:03:57,821
♫   Give me something sweeter, I don't know   ♫

30
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,651
Mr. Dan!

31
00:04:02,341 --> 00:04:07,951
Whoa! Ah! Oh! Ms. Jeong! Oh, how are you?

32
00:04:07,951 --> 00:04:10,761
What happened? Are you actually back for good?

33
00:04:10,761 --> 00:04:14,041
You've been through a lot because of me, right? I'm sorry.

34
00:04:15,491 --> 00:04:19,121
You've done well until today. You can start commuting as of today.

35
00:04:20,581 --> 00:04:24,871
I knew it. I thought I heard the door open, so I called the security company

36
00:04:24,871 --> 00:04:26,951
to take a look at the CCTV footage.

37
00:04:26,951 --> 00:04:28,901
- No! 
 - No!

38
00:04:33,431 --> 00:04:36,001
So it was Mr. Dan.

39
00:04:40,891 --> 00:04:46,181
MIss, that friend of yours... The man who asked for more time, did he show up?

40
00:04:47,311 --> 00:04:50,971
Oh, yes, maybe, probably. I don't really know...

41
00:04:50,971 --> 00:04:55,601
Tell her not to trust men too much. A guy who's so wishy-washy

42
00:04:55,601 --> 00:04:59,301
will certainly turn out to be a bad guy in the end.

43
00:05:12,191 --> 00:05:14,361
I waited to the best of my ability.

44
00:05:14,361 --> 00:05:18,471
I ate well, too, and I practiced well.

45
00:05:18,471 --> 00:05:21,081
You're a good girl, Lee Yeon Seo.

46
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:24,361
Where were you and what were you doing?

47
00:05:25,531 --> 00:05:27,601
You're not going to tell me?

48
00:05:29,981 --> 00:05:31,731
Go inside.

49
00:05:34,781 --> 00:05:36,561
Guys who are so wishy-washy are bad guys after all.

50
00:05:36,561 --> 00:05:38,691
No! I'm staying by your side from now on.

51
00:05:38,691 --> 00:05:42,711
I decided to do that as soon as I walked in yesterday.

52
00:05:42,711 --> 00:05:46,511
It doesn't matter if you just stay by my side. Your heart might be with someone else.

53
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:51,421
It's not a crime to love a lot, but it's a crime to have too many secrets.

54
00:05:51,421 --> 00:05:55,871
- Says who?
 - Says Lee Yeon Seo! She's a really great person.

55
00:05:59,461 --> 00:06:03,031
Do well, great person.

56
00:06:13,401 --> 00:06:16,081
 Are you going to be her Rib? 

57
00:06:16,081 --> 00:06:17,591
 It's none of your business. 

58
00:06:17,591 --> 00:06:21,481
 If I turn into dust or dissipate, that's for me to deal with. 

59
00:06:26,651 --> 00:06:28,601
 You'll be very lucky if you just dissipate. 

60
00:06:28,601 --> 00:06:34,371
 You can't even imagine what the punishment is like. Something horrendous will happen. 

61
00:06:34,371 --> 00:06:38,671
 How do you know that? 

62
00:06:38,671 --> 00:06:42,631
 There was a young angel  

63
00:06:42,631 --> 00:06:47,091
 who thought he was special just like you. 

64
00:06:48,801 --> 00:06:51,371
 Her Rib? Love? 

65
00:06:51,371 --> 00:06:55,161
 You need to give up. There won't be a happy ending. One of you will 

66
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:57,551
 end up living a dreadful life. 

67
00:06:57,551 --> 00:07:00,971
 So, do not throw a stone into the still water to satisfy your desires. 

68
00:07:00,971 --> 00:07:05,391
 Pretend like you're a human, then disappear quietly.  

69
00:07:07,351 --> 00:07:11,441
 Desire? You might be right. 

70
00:07:11,441 --> 00:07:17,691
 But... I don't want to be a coward. 

71
00:07:17,691 --> 00:07:21,001
 I would like for Yeon Seo to know who I am. 

72
00:07:21,001 --> 00:07:23,311
 Whether I'm human or not, 

73
00:07:23,311 --> 00:07:25,051
 dead or alive, 

74
00:07:25,051 --> 00:07:27,591
 I want her to know my present and my past  

75
00:07:27,591 --> 00:07:31,891
 and love me for who I am. Don't you feel the same? 

76
00:07:32,851 --> 00:07:37,721
 Don't you wish... to be understood? 

77
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,131
 No, I don't need that. 

78
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:47,681
 The moment you confess, everything will end. 

79
00:07:48,831 --> 00:07:50,271
 Fine, do as you please. 

80
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:54,421
 However, keep your mouth shut until the audition. Until then– 

81
00:07:54,421 --> 00:07:58,591
 I was going to do that anyway. You're not the only one who cares about her. 

82
00:07:58,591 --> 00:08:03,051
 So, don't try to give me any advice. 

83
00:08:10,111 --> 00:08:14,141
 By the way, about that angel. 

84
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,561
 Why do I feel like it's... 

85
00:08:24,031 --> 00:08:29,201
 Never mind. You're nothing but a foolish and weak 

86
00:08:30,181 --> 00:08:32,661
 human being. 

87
00:09:15,361 --> 00:09:18,721
 Ask your petty God why I'm like this. 

88
00:09:18,721 --> 00:09:21,831
 And whether it's Yeon Seo or Kim Dan, 

89
00:09:21,831 --> 00:09:27,441
 if He wants to ruin my plans again, tell Him to wake up as well. 

90
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,741
Ruin his plans again?

91
00:09:29,741 --> 00:09:33,261
 Living is already a torment. Wishing to be born again is a silly thought. 

92
00:09:33,261 --> 00:09:38,701
 And wishing for peace on the other side sounds lame, doesn't it? 

93
00:09:40,591 --> 00:09:43,851


94
00:09:52,201 --> 00:09:54,911
   

95
00:10:11,801 --> 00:10:15,241
Lower your shoulders. Okay, that's good.

96
00:10:37,901 --> 00:10:39,801
Welcome!

97
00:10:45,501 --> 00:10:46,901
Au-Auntie.

98
00:10:46,901 --> 00:10:49,201
- One soju please.
 - Yes.

99
00:10:52,101 --> 00:10:54,201
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

100
00:11:19,501 --> 00:11:21,501
     

101
00:11:21,501 --> 00:11:25,101
  Wait just a little while. You're a dad, too.  

102
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,101
 You understand my feelings, right? 

103
00:11:37,851 --> 00:11:42,301
Mr. Park, I'm known for my persistence.

104
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:45,901
Would you like me to leave

105
00:11:45,901 --> 00:11:48,201
80 missed calls?

106
00:11:56,501 --> 00:11:57,901
Yes, Ms. Jeong.

107
00:11:57,901 --> 00:11:59,301
Are you not feeling well?

108
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,701
Why is your voice...

109
00:12:01,701 --> 00:12:04,301
Don't tell me you've changed your mind.

110
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:06,301
  Ah, no, it's not that...  

111
00:12:06,301 --> 00:12:09,901
  If you don't come at 3:00 tomorrow, I'll go to Fantasia with my own feet. 

112
00:12:09,901 --> 00:12:11,101
  Do you understand?  

113
00:12:11,101 --> 00:12:14,501
  Don't sound so scary, I didn't forget.  

114
00:12:22,901 --> 00:12:27,601
Do you know that Kim Dan is giving up on his mission and is about to cause a mess?

115
00:12:28,301 --> 00:12:29,901
I don't care if your junior or underling

116
00:12:29,901 --> 00:12:33,701
turns into dust as punishment after acting recklessly,

117
00:12:33,701 --> 00:12:36,101
but I thought you should at least know about it.

118
00:12:36,101 --> 00:12:38,401
Do as you please.

119
00:12:38,401 --> 00:12:40,301
Come here and sit.

120
00:12:46,001 --> 00:12:50,901
Let's have a drink. Humans sometimes drink

121
00:12:50,901 --> 00:12:53,401
instead of praying.

122
00:12:53,401 --> 00:12:55,501
I have nothing more to say.

123
00:12:55,501 --> 00:12:57,101
I did hear

124
00:12:57,101 --> 00:13:01,801
about an abandoned angel who had turned into a human.

125
00:13:07,501 --> 00:13:10,101
"They reeled and staggered

126
00:13:10,101 --> 00:13:13,501
like drunkards."

127
00:13:14,701 --> 00:13:17,301
"They were at

128
00:13:17,301 --> 00:13:19,901
their wit's end."

129
00:13:20,711 --> 00:13:22,631
You didn't forget it.

130
00:13:24,001 --> 00:13:25,901
I'm tired of those verses.

131
00:13:26,701 --> 00:13:29,101
But they just won't disappear from my memory.

132
00:13:37,101 --> 00:13:38,501
You must've gone through a lot.

133
00:13:38,501 --> 00:13:42,901
You were left in this barren world,

134
00:13:42,901 --> 00:13:46,501
not being able to live or die.

135
00:13:48,801 --> 00:13:52,301
Are you saying that you understand me as a merciful angel yourself?

136
00:13:52,301 --> 00:13:56,601
Then what? Did you expect me to kneel down and repent for my sins?

137
00:13:56,601 --> 00:14:01,401
Dream on and just please take care of your junior.

138
00:14:03,701 --> 00:14:06,901
Why are you so hostile towards Dan?

139
00:14:06,901 --> 00:14:08,101
You achieved your goal.

140
00:14:08,101 --> 00:14:11,301
You successfully placed that woman who looks exactly like your dead lover.

141
00:14:11,301 --> 00:14:15,701
No, I mean Yeon Seo on stage.

142
00:14:15,701 --> 00:14:17,701
You did it.

143
00:14:22,901 --> 00:14:24,901
At first, I thought so, too.

144
00:14:25,811 --> 00:14:28,321
I thought she was the perfect key.

145
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:32,701
I thought it would be over as soon as I put her on stage. However...

146
00:14:32,701 --> 00:14:36,801
It might be an endless tunnel, but it'll be easier together.

147

♫  A constant brink of pain  ♫

148

You used to say living was hell.

I want to break free...

00:15:55,101 --> 00:15:57,601
     

160
00:16:00,701 --> 00:16:05,101
Yeon Seo, listen carefully to what I'm going say now...

161
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:07,531
Do you...

162
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:11,501
Do you know what a guardian angel is?

163
00:16:13,501 --> 00:16:14,501
No.

164
00:16:14,501 --> 00:16:15,701
Don't be alarmed.

165
00:16:15,701 --> 00:16:17,501
If I'm scaring you...

166
00:16:18,301 --> 00:16:19,901
Darn it. Ji Kang Woo said it before.

167
00:16:19,901 --> 00:16:21,501
So...

168
00:16:23,301 --> 00:16:25,701
I was Seong Woo.

169
00:16:25,701 --> 00:16:30,201
I was Seong Woo, but I died and became an angel.

170
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,831
But I just happened to remember that.

171
00:16:36,701 --> 00:16:38,901
Ugh! What am I saying?

172
00:16:49,871 --> 00:16:51,301
   

173
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,901
Miss Yeon Seo?

174
00:16:55,701 --> 00:16:56,501
Hello.

175
00:16:56,501 --> 00:16:59,401
 Come to the garden right now. 

176
00:17:05,301 --> 00:17:07,801
Sit down. It's chamomile.

177
00:17:07,801 --> 00:17:09,701
"Miss Yeon Seo"?

178
00:17:09,701 --> 00:17:14,101
You inserted that, didn't you? You shouldn't use my phone without my permission.

179
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:17,901
Why is it yours? I bought that phone with my money.

180
00:17:17,901 --> 00:17:21,501
And what's wrong with the name? It's much better than Noisy Gong.

181
00:17:22,901 --> 00:17:25,501
"Miss Yeon Seo," try it.

182
00:17:28,701 --> 00:17:33,301
Miss Yeon Seo, what would you like?

183
00:17:33,301 --> 00:17:35,701
Do you have trouble sleeping?

184
00:17:42,101 --> 00:17:44,101
Which one is of these two is it?

185
00:17:44,101 --> 00:17:47,501
Are you married or do you have a terminal disease?

186
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:52,901
I thought about it. What is it you could be hiding from me,

187
00:17:52,901 --> 00:17:54,901
and what do you need to figure out?

188
00:17:54,901 --> 00:17:59,701
You're not supposed to like me, but you ended up liking me.  Why does that break your heart?

189
00:17:59,701 --> 00:18:03,601
What could it be? It's either that you're married or you're ill.

190
00:18:05,841 --> 00:18:08,471
Come on. It's not either one.

191
00:18:09,501 --> 00:18:11,701
There's no one else other than you.

192
00:18:11,701 --> 00:18:14,901
You're my first and last.

193
00:18:15,901 --> 00:18:19,101
And my body is really strong. I'm not ill.

194
00:18:19,101 --> 00:18:23,601
Then, in the time you were gone, what did you do?

195
00:18:24,301 --> 00:18:26,201
Where did you go?

196
00:18:27,301 --> 00:18:29,701
I'll tell you everything after the audition.

197
00:18:29,701 --> 00:18:34,201
I don't want to bother you for no good reason before your big day.

198
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:42,701
Kim Dan, listen carefully.

199
00:18:42,701 --> 00:18:47,901
When it comes to you, down to every strand of hair, it's never trivial to me.

200
00:18:47,901 --> 00:18:52,301
To me, you're the most important.

201
00:18:52,301 --> 00:18:54,101
Do you understand?

202
00:18:58,301 --> 00:19:02,301
Tell me. It's all okay; everything.

203
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:04,901
Everything?

204
00:19:11,091 --> 00:19:12,991
The truth is...

205
00:19:15,461 --> 00:19:19,841
I met my father.

206
00:19:24,901 --> 00:19:27,301
Gosh. It's the first time saying something like this.

207
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:32,901
Your father who kicked you out?

208
00:19:32,901 --> 00:19:36,701
Did you ask for forgiveness for your mistake?

209
00:19:38,101 --> 00:19:42,301
Well, it's a common, boring story.

210
00:19:43,901 --> 00:19:47,401
I'd completely forgotten about him for over a decade of my life.

211
00:19:47,401 --> 00:19:51,101
I met him right before he died

212
00:19:51,101 --> 00:19:53,901
to ask things I was curious about

213
00:19:54,801 --> 00:19:56,701
and say goodbye.

214
00:20:00,301 --> 00:20:02,251
Just things like that.

215
00:20:03,901 --> 00:20:07,901
What were you curious about?

216
00:20:07,901 --> 00:20:09,601
Just...

217
00:20:10,701 --> 00:20:14,601
I wondered why he was so harsh on me.

218
00:20:17,301 --> 00:20:19,501
I was his son, after all.

219
00:20:20,861 --> 00:20:23,211
He should've loved me.

220
00:20:27,801 --> 00:20:29,301
Those kinds of things.

221
00:20:30,301 --> 00:20:33,801
Did you receive an apology?

222
00:20:37,301 --> 00:20:38,901
Yes, it's a relief.

223
00:20:42,501 --> 00:20:46,201
Now, that's all I have to say. Wasn't that boring?

224
00:20:49,801 --> 00:20:51,501
Come here.

225
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:55,301
No, I'm fine. I've let things go.

226
00:20:59,901 --> 00:21:02,301
You, and me,

227
00:21:03,641 --> 00:21:06,761
we're all alone in this world.

228
00:21:09,881 --> 00:21:14,101
You've been through a lot, my Dan.

229
00:21:22,891 --> 00:21:25,361
I am completely okay.

230
00:21:26,501 --> 00:21:28,501
I'm really okay.

231
00:21:52,171 --> 00:21:54,291
What time do you finish rehearsal today?

232
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:56,481
Let me see. Around 6:00.

233
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,431
Darn it. I was hoping it would be at 3:00 p.m.

234
00:21:58,431 --> 00:22:00,381
Hey, look at your outfit. Is that new?

235
00:22:00,381 --> 00:22:02,501
- What do you think? It's pretty, right?
 - Wow.

236
00:22:02,501 --> 00:22:05,261
Are you teaching more classes?

237
00:22:05,261 --> 00:22:07,761
Do you have the time?

238
00:22:07,761 --> 00:22:13,611
By the way, did you two meet with Associate Director Geum?

239
00:22:14,381 --> 00:22:15,631
Oh my.

240
00:22:15,631 --> 00:22:19,231
Did Associate Director Geum contact you in private?

241
00:22:19,231 --> 00:22:23,231
I don't know. I just heard about it.

242
00:22:27,191 --> 00:22:29,291
I'll cancel the audition, and publicly announce

243
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:35,381
that the general director and associate director bought votes from the corps and tried to make Ni Na take the leading role.

244
00:22:35,381 --> 00:22:38,281
I'll announce it to the association and the media, too.

245
00:22:38,281 --> 00:22:39,911
Go ahead.

246
00:22:39,911 --> 00:22:45,081
However, you have neither witnesses nor evidence.

247
00:22:45,081 --> 00:22:46,461
Be ready to take responsibility for telling everyone that Fantasia is in ruins.

248
00:22:46,461 --> 00:22:51,511
Regardless of the results, you tried to buy the votes. I bet you can't deny that.

249
00:22:51,511 --> 00:22:54,071
I only met with my dancers in private as an associate director.

250
00:22:54,071 --> 00:22:58,291
I asked if they needed help or there were suggestions for the ballet theatre.

251
00:22:58,291 --> 00:23:02,251
If you're calling that buying votes, I'll take responsibility and resign from Fantasia.

252
00:23:02,251 --> 00:23:04,861
Your resignation won't be enough to resolve this matter.

253
00:23:04,861 --> 00:23:08,891
If the audition isn't executed fairly, don't you know that we won't be able to prepare the show properly?

254
00:23:08,891 --> 00:23:14,401
What do you and General Director Choi really want from this ballet theatre?

255
00:23:14,401 --> 00:23:15,471
Is it merely about money?

256
00:23:15,471 --> 00:23:17,701
Director Ji!

257
00:23:19,361 --> 00:23:24,351
You keep condemning General Director Choi and me as if we're the most despicable people on Earth.

258
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:29,551
Let me give you a warning, with all due respect.

259
00:23:29,551 --> 00:23:34,171
Please restrain yourself before my patience runs out.

260
00:23:36,781 --> 00:23:38,831
We'll proceed with the audition as planned.

261
00:23:38,831 --> 00:23:42,821
Give me all of the evidence that proved we bought the votes with money or bribes.

262
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:46,781
Once I confirm it with my eyes, I'll cancel the audition.

263
00:24:09,131 --> 00:24:12,391
My goodness!

264
00:24:12,391 --> 00:24:15,001
- No one followed you here, right? 
 - No.

265
00:24:15,001 --> 00:24:17,981
- What about you? 
 - You're acting carefully so they don't suspect you, right?

266
00:24:17,981 --> 00:24:20,121
Of course! No one knows, no one.

267
00:24:20,121 --> 00:24:22,051
 I stayed up all night. 

268
00:24:22,051 --> 00:24:25,441
  Good job. Let's go in.  

269
00:24:37,241 --> 00:24:39,151
Who is this?

270
00:24:39,151 --> 00:24:42,641
- Mr. Moon Ji Woong. 
  - Mr. Park 

271
00:24:43,931 --> 00:24:46,321
Where and how have you been all these years? You never called!

272
00:24:46,321 --> 00:24:50,891
After hearing from Ms. Jeong, I knew it would be you.

273
00:24:50,891 --> 00:24:52,211
What do you mean?

274
00:24:52,211 --> 00:24:54,761
You can catch up later. Let's cut to the chase.

275
00:24:54,761 --> 00:24:57,601
Ji Woong is going to testify for us.

276
00:24:57,601 --> 00:24:58,271
About what?

277
00:24:58,271 --> 00:25:01,301
The accident three years ago when Miss became blind.

278
00:25:01,301 --> 00:25:03,181
That wasn't an accident, it was an incident.

279
00:25:03,181 --> 00:25:05,491
Someone instigated the incident, and it was totally planned.

280
00:25:05,491 --> 00:25:07,131
  W-What did you say?  

281
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:08,861
Who did?

282
00:25:13,191 --> 00:25:14,941
 Is it ready? 

283
00:25:14,941 --> 00:25:19,181
 I'll do it since I'm instructed to do so. But she might really die from it. 

284
00:25:19,181 --> 00:25:21,801
 Right. That's the whole point. 

285
00:25:21,801 --> 00:25:27,521
 If you fail, you will have to return all the money we've given you. 

286
00:25:27,521 --> 00:25:28,591
  Please.  

287
00:25:28,591 --> 00:25:30,741
  Don't forget that.  

288
00:25:33,911 --> 00:25:38,461
The ending of Act Two. It's when Lee Yeon Seo's solo scene ends.

289
00:25:50,371 --> 00:25:52,581
 I knew it was wrong. 

290
00:25:52,581 --> 00:25:56,141
I shouldn't have done it even if I was about to lose everything.

291
00:25:56,141 --> 00:25:59,791
I think it was a trap. You said he never once gambled cards,

292
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:02,711
but your father owed thousands of dollars for gambling within days.

293
00:26:02,711 --> 00:26:06,511
And a stranger gave you ₩10 million ($10,000) and ₩5 million ($5,000) for no reason.

294
00:26:06,511 --> 00:26:08,121
I bet it was all part of the plan.

295
00:26:08,121 --> 00:26:09,571
Who? Who? Who?

296
00:26:09,571 --> 00:26:11,491
I have to find that out.

297
00:26:11,491 --> 00:26:14,201
When the audition ends tomorrow, I'll go to the police station with Miss.

298
00:26:14,201 --> 00:26:19,231
 You must bring the recording file and documents you told me about by tomorrow, Mr. Park. 

299
00:26:19,231 --> 00:26:20,891
Yes.

300
00:26:34,611 --> 00:26:36,231
   

301
00:26:36,231 --> 00:26:38,741
   

302
00:26:39,911 --> 00:26:41,471
 We should look into that now. 

303
00:26:41,471 --> 00:26:44,211
  When the audition ends tomorrow, I'll go to the police station with Miss.  

304
00:26:44,211 --> 00:26:49,651
You must bring the recording file and documents you told me about by tomorrow, Mr. Park.

305
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:52,871
I told you to stay still.

306
00:26:52,871 --> 00:26:57,561
If you had a conscience, you wouldn't have done that to begin with.

307
00:26:57,561 --> 00:27:02,501
You're dying anyway, and you're scared of hell?

308
00:27:33,831 --> 00:27:35,431
I said to stay still.

309
00:27:35,431 --> 00:27:38,511
How can I stay still? You said you were going to die after this.

310
00:27:38,511 --> 00:27:42,711
He should know better. He deceived Giselle.

311
00:27:43,931 --> 00:27:47,571
Because he deceived her, she's going to die. How dare he hold her hand?

312
00:27:47,571 --> 00:27:49,491
He didn't know that would happen.

313
00:27:49,491 --> 00:27:51,701
He feels bad, so he wants to atone for what he did.

314
00:27:51,701 --> 00:27:53,431
That's no use.

315
00:27:53,431 --> 00:27:56,221
Can you just kill everyone like Director Ji's interpretation?

316
00:27:56,221 --> 00:28:00,531
That's more intense. You really have to win tomorrow.

317
00:28:00,531 --> 00:28:02,251
And don't forget.

318
00:28:02,251 --> 00:28:04,061
Tomorrow, at 5:00—

319
00:28:04,061 --> 00:28:07,611
How many times do you have to tell me? The party at the cafe in front of the police station.

320
00:28:07,611 --> 00:28:09,491
You can celebrate or comfort me. Do whatever you want.

321
00:28:09,491 --> 00:28:12,911
Things will get very hectic after tomorrow.

322
00:28:12,911 --> 00:28:15,701
- Be ready. 
 - Okay.

323
00:28:20,551 --> 00:28:21,811
Let's try one more time.

324
00:28:21,811 --> 00:28:23,601
You've been doing this for three hours now.

325
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:25,371
It's because something is still bothering me.

326
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:29,001
I'm still in love, but I know he deceived me.

327
00:28:29,001 --> 00:28:31,211
I don't know what to do.

328
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:37,491
   

329
00:28:41,361 --> 00:28:43,151
  Are you sleeping?  

330
00:28:44,961 --> 00:28:47,381
N-No, why?

331
00:28:51,071 --> 00:28:53,751
Shall we practice a bit more?

332
00:28:53,751 --> 00:28:55,221
Huh?

333
00:28:55,221 --> 00:28:56,471
Come on, let's go.

334
00:28:56,471 --> 00:28:58,501
I said I need to practice.

335
00:28:58,501 --> 00:29:03,231
Let's forget everything and get some fresh air.

336
00:29:03,231 --> 00:29:04,461
What do you want to see?

337
00:29:04,461 --> 00:29:08,681
River, ocean, tree, field, tell me everything. I'll take you there.

338
00:29:11,891 --> 00:29:14,141
Stars.

339
00:29:14,141 --> 00:29:17,721
I want to see the stars, with you.

340
00:30:12,181 --> 00:30:16,061
He must've had a reason.

341
00:30:16,061 --> 00:30:17,831
What?

342
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:23,371
Since that man also sincerely loved Giselle.

343
00:30:23,371 --> 00:30:27,971
Maybe the first engagement was made against his will.

344
00:30:27,971 --> 00:30:31,931
That's probably why he ran away to the countryside.

345
00:30:32,791 --> 00:30:34,851
Keep going.

346
00:30:37,321 --> 00:30:43,941
He ended up in a strange place, met a woman, and fell in love with her.

347
00:30:43,941 --> 00:30:51,901
He shouldn't have fallen in love with her, but no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't help but fall in love.

348
00:30:54,401 --> 00:30:56,721
He probably made a decision

349
00:30:56,721 --> 00:31:01,611
to leave everything and live here.

350
00:31:01,611 --> 00:31:04,521
Then he should've told her earlier.

351
00:31:07,111 --> 00:31:09,641
He probably wanted to,

352
00:31:09,641 --> 00:31:17,211
but he put it off a day and another day.

353
00:31:17,211 --> 00:31:20,811
Was he afraid she'd leave if she found out the truth?

354
00:31:21,591 --> 00:31:22,961
He was probably afraid.

355
00:31:22,961 --> 00:31:25,251
He didn't trust her.

356
00:31:27,401 --> 00:31:34,121
The man trusted his love, but not Giselle's love.

357
00:31:34,121 --> 00:31:38,921
She's a woman who loved him after she became a spirit.

358
00:31:40,201 --> 00:31:42,391
That's sad.

359
00:31:44,651 --> 00:31:47,201
Let's go. I need to dance.

360
00:31:47,201 --> 00:31:48,471
Right now?

361
00:31:48,471 --> 00:31:51,251
I need to try it out when I get the feeling. Let's go.

362
00:31:59,911 --> 00:32:06,841
