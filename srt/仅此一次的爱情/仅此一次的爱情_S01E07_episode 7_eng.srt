1
00:00:01,543 --> 00:00:08,733


2
00:00:16,673 --> 00:00:18,613
 Oh, it's the rude princess. 

3
00:00:18,613 --> 00:00:20,143
 Come dance with me now. 

4
00:00:20,143 --> 00:00:21,543
 Dance. 

5
00:00:21,543 --> 00:00:24,103
 What's wrong with you? 

6
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:29,933
Ah, darn. It's the alcohol!

7
00:00:29,933 --> 00:00:32,853
It's the cause of all evil!

8
00:00:34,393 --> 00:00:36,493
No, don't come close to me! I'm embarrassed.

9
00:00:36,493 --> 00:00:38,103
Mr. Kim Da,

10
00:00:42,163 --> 00:00:44,863
please come with me.

11
00:00:44,863 --> 00:00:46,263
Ah, please wait a second!

12
00:00:46,263 --> 00:00:49,023
Hey, hey! You know me! I work here!

13
00:00:49,023 --> 00:00:50,253
But you got fired.

14
00:00:50,253 --> 00:00:52,473
Even so, how can you do this?

15
00:00:52,473 --> 00:00:54,773
We got a report for trespassing, what can we do?

16
00:00:54,773 --> 00:00:56,343
All right, let's go.

17
00:00:56,343 --> 00:00:58,253
Hey, hey! Lee Yeon Seo!

18
00:00:58,253 --> 00:01:00,103
Hey, was it really you? Did you do this?

19
00:01:00,103 --> 00:01:01,663
Let's talk, just five minutes!

20
00:01:01,663 --> 00:01:03,763
- Ah, just one minute! 
- We'll take him away.

21
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:06,413
Ah, if I have to leave I'll leave, just not like this!

22
00:01:06,413 --> 00:01:07,673
Be quiet seriously!

23
00:01:07,673 --> 00:01:09,813
Just a moment.

24
00:01:11,843 --> 00:01:13,903
Trespassing? Report?

25
00:01:13,903 --> 00:01:16,793
I'm already well aware that you're completely irrational and beyond hope. Did you think I wasn't?

26
00:01:16,793 --> 00:01:20,013
I was about to leave on my own anyway!

27
00:01:20,483 --> 00:01:25,803
Still, I trusted you. That even if you're different from me, you'd understand how I was feeling.

28
00:01:25,803 --> 00:01:29,023
That I came because I was worried and sorry, you Noisy Gong!

29
00:01:29,023 --> 00:01:31,023
- You're a fraud. 
- What are you saying?

30
00:01:31,023 --> 00:01:33,313
You sneaky b*stard.

31
00:01:33,313 --> 00:01:35,523
I've gone from a pervert to a quack and now this?

32
00:01:35,523 --> 00:01:37,563
You deceived me!

33
00:01:41,163 --> 00:01:43,693
If you confess right now,

34
00:01:43,693 --> 00:01:47,153
I'll let you off easy. A firing, lawsuit for damages, and request for prosecution.

35
00:01:47,153 --> 00:01:51,013
I was always sincere. I never lied even once!

36
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:53,833
I'm serious.

37
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:57,143
We've met before, haven't we? Before your interview here.

38
00:01:57,143 --> 00:02:01,073
When I couldn't see.

39
00:02:02,093 --> 00:02:05,373
Answer me. Without a single lie.

40
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:28,963
 Kim Dan, who on earth are you? 

41
00:02:30,243 --> 00:02:32,403
 Why are you doing this to me? 

42
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:36,493
 Don't worry. I'll definitely do it! 

43
00:02:36,493 --> 00:02:41,623
 I will make Lee Yeon Seo's mission complete! 

44
00:02:42,153 --> 00:02:50,923
 Just because you experienced tragedy,  doesn't mean you can become twisted. 

45
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:57,233
 Not everyone who meets with tragedy becomes as twisted as you. 

46
00:02:57,233 --> 00:03:00,163
 If you tell me who it was, I will forgive you. 

47
00:03:00,163 --> 00:03:01,593
 It was probably an accident. 

48
00:03:01,593 --> 00:03:02,813
 Oh my, why isn't it working? 

49
00:03:02,813 --> 00:03:06,153
 My goodness, It's not working! 

50
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,363
 No way... 

51
00:03:19,363 --> 00:03:20,953
Answer me Kim Dan!

52
00:03:20,953 --> 00:03:23,783
You knew me before you came here.

53
00:03:27,993 --> 00:03:29,753
That's right.

54
00:03:33,033 --> 00:03:36,783
That rainy day, beneath the tree.

55
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,423
That was you, wasn't it?

56
00:03:39,423 --> 00:03:40,503
It was just by chance.

57
00:03:40,503 --> 00:03:43,733
I mean, it was as the Good Lord intended, but—

58
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:45,153
So you were just "following orders."

59
00:03:45,153 --> 00:03:48,463
I was also surprised to see it was you of all people!

60
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:52,833
Who sent you?

61
00:03:56,213 --> 00:03:59,673
From above.

62
00:04:01,643 --> 00:04:03,163
So you are only following orders, huh?

63
00:04:03,163 --> 00:04:04,483
Lee Yeon Seo, about that—

64
00:04:04,483 --> 00:04:07,073
All that about me being your goal in life

65
00:04:07,073 --> 00:04:10,153
and you saying that you exist for me,

66
00:04:13,663 --> 00:04:15,203
so you weren't lying.

67
00:04:15,203 --> 00:04:17,163
I thought I was doing a favor for you.

68
00:04:17,163 --> 00:04:21,633
About what? Breaking the window to scare me and trying to paralyze me for the rest of my life?

69
00:04:22,723 --> 00:04:24,553
What are you talking about?

70
00:04:24,553 --> 00:04:26,873
They must be quite stupid

71
00:04:26,873 --> 00:04:29,433
to send such a useless spy.

72
00:04:29,433 --> 00:04:31,273
Spy?

73
00:04:34,923 --> 00:04:37,303
You were original though, I'll give you that.

74
00:04:38,193 --> 00:04:39,973
We're done here.

75
00:04:44,023 --> 00:04:45,903
Spy?

76
00:04:50,943 --> 00:04:54,313
Okay, let's start after dinner. With what did you break the window?

77
00:04:54,313 --> 00:04:56,973
What about the chandelier? Did you cut off the line in advance?

78
00:04:56,973 --> 00:04:59,303
A knife? Saw?

79
00:04:59,303 --> 00:05:02,273
To be completely honest...

80
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:07,343
That night, I saved that young lady.

81
00:05:07,343 --> 00:05:10,683
The window shattered with a crack and the glass was coming down like rain, and I spread my—

82
00:05:10,683 --> 00:05:12,403
My wing—

83
00:05:15,343 --> 00:05:16,583
My arms covered her.

84
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:20,593
So you fabricated the crime to make her trust you?

85
00:05:27,313 --> 00:05:29,033
Butler!

86
00:05:29,033 --> 00:05:32,423
Let's not be like this. Let's bring Mr. Dan back. Okay?

87
00:05:32,423 --> 00:05:35,333
Should I explain it again from the beginning? He deceived me.

88
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:38,423
He just left something out. He wasn't purposefully lying.

89
00:05:38,423 --> 00:05:39,793
Didn't you say he answered you honestly?

90
00:05:39,793 --> 00:05:41,853
If he wanted to hide something, he would have lied to the end.

91
00:05:41,853 --> 00:05:44,323
Everyone in this world seems suspicious to you, don't they?

92
00:05:44,323 --> 00:05:47,353
How do you even bring yourself to trust me?

93
00:05:47,873 --> 00:05:50,233
Because you're not sweet to me at all.

94
00:05:51,693 --> 00:05:56,323
Look at this. What kind of spy eats this much chocolate.

95
00:05:57,993 --> 00:06:01,123
Like a child, he only waited for his birthday.

96
00:06:02,353 --> 00:06:04,973
That was probably the deadline to kill me by.

97
00:06:06,503 --> 00:06:10,083
Look at this! He studied you so thoroughly.

98
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,893
What's this?

99
00:06:12,893 --> 00:06:16,813
Love. Dating. Feelings. Heart?

100
00:06:16,813 --> 00:06:17,953
     

101
00:06:17,953 --> 00:06:19,723
 Love... 

102
00:06:20,573 --> 00:06:22,583
 Dating... 

103
00:06:25,223 --> 00:06:27,933
 Heart. 

104
00:06:28,703 --> 00:06:30,583
My word! Could it be...?

105
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:33,393
No way...

106
00:06:36,133 --> 00:06:38,063
It couldn't be.

107
00:06:38,513 --> 00:06:40,053
What?

108
00:06:40,053 --> 00:06:44,523
 Love at first sight. 

109
00:06:46,883 --> 00:06:49,423
 He approached you carefully. 

110
00:06:49,923 --> 00:06:56,023
 to taste the same air as you, if only for a moment. He wanted to cherish that moment— 

111
00:06:56,023 --> 00:06:57,863
Nonsense!

112
00:06:57,863 --> 00:07:00,703
He was sent from above, that's what he said himself.

113
00:07:00,703 --> 00:07:02,893
Yeah, from Heaven.

114
00:07:02,893 --> 00:07:05,193
He could have been sent by fate.

115
00:07:06,123 --> 00:07:08,463
Do you hate living here that much?

116
00:07:09,393 --> 00:07:11,233
Didn't you say he hugged you?

117
00:07:11,233 --> 00:07:16,293
A person who looked over this contract so thoroughly ignored the condition about physical contact.

118
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,553
That was because of the shattered glass—

119
00:07:25,553 --> 00:07:31,153
"I just want to stay by her side," is what he must have been thinking. "Just as her secretary, as a physical guardian."

120
00:07:31,153 --> 00:07:33,853
But people's feelings can't be controlled so easily.

121
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:35,693
Butler.

122
00:07:39,933 --> 00:07:41,863
Take all that to him.

123
00:07:43,483 --> 00:07:46,123
Since he said he'd been kicked out and has nowhere to go,

124
00:07:46,123 --> 00:07:48,883
where and what could he be doing?

125
00:07:50,253 --> 00:07:54,233
He must have felt so hurt, being dragged to the police station.

126
00:07:54,233 --> 00:07:58,043
 I was always sincere! I've never even lied to you! 

127
00:07:58,573 --> 00:08:00,853
 It's quite refreshing. At the least. 

128
00:08:09,593 --> 00:08:11,523
She didn't fall for it.

129
00:08:17,273 --> 00:08:18,603
This isn't your home.

130
00:08:18,603 --> 00:08:21,743
Just for one night! The police told me to go home, but I have...

131
00:08:21,743 --> 00:08:22,803
nowhere to go.

132
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:26,823
Like I told you, once you've been dispatched on the mission, you can't come back until you've fulfilled it.

133
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:29,393
I've gotten started.

134
00:08:29,393 --> 00:08:31,653
The rib of fate or whatever, I've found her guy

135
00:08:31,653 --> 00:08:32,893
and now I've just got to get them together.

136
00:08:32,893 --> 00:08:34,433
Then, how did you get kicked out?

137
00:08:34,433 --> 00:08:39,013
I set it up for you, covered for you when you messed up, I've done everything I possibly could to help you out.

138
00:08:39,013 --> 00:08:40,423
Ugh, seriously!

139
00:08:40,423 --> 00:08:43,473
There must be something wrong with this body!

140
00:08:46,433 --> 00:08:47,603
How about you, Senior?

141
00:08:47,603 --> 00:08:49,843
Doesn't your blood pressure rise when you say awful things

142
00:08:49,843 --> 00:08:53,763
and don't you feel all ticklish when you feel like you've gotten a little closer to someone?

143
00:08:53,763 --> 00:08:58,963
Don't brag about an angel getting fired after arguing with a human and losing his temper.

144
00:09:00,033 --> 00:09:02,753
I may have lost the job, but the mission is still a go.

145
00:09:02,753 --> 00:09:05,683
Even if I'm not by her side, she just has to fall in love. Right?

146
00:09:05,683 --> 00:09:09,233
Oh, so you want to play matchmaker from the shadows?

147
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:14,323
Oh! That sounds good! I can appear in her dream.

148
00:09:14,323 --> 00:09:15,833
"Don't be startled."

149
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:18,303
"Behold! A new era in your life awaits!"

150
00:09:18,303 --> 00:09:22,803
In Lee Yeon Seo's loveless and empty heart, new love will blossom.

151
00:09:22,803 --> 00:09:25,393
That's amazing, right?

152
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:29,553
Ouch, seriously.

153
00:09:29,553 --> 00:09:32,083
Senior!  Senior!

154
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,953
Then, at least give me some money!

155
00:09:33,953 --> 00:09:36,113
Just ₩10,000 ($10). ₩5,000 won ($5)!

156
00:09:36,113 --> 00:09:38,463
Ugh, seriously!

157
00:09:38,463 --> 00:09:42,673
When it comes to chasing me off with nothing, humans and angels are the same!

158
00:09:42,673 --> 00:09:44,373
     

159
00:09:46,763 --> 00:09:49,153
What would you like?

160
00:09:49,153 --> 00:09:52,633
 Wow! Hot dogs! 

161
00:09:54,213 --> 00:09:57,013
Go inside first and wait. I'll buy the food and come along.

162
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,563
Yes!

163
00:09:59,843 --> 00:10:01,933
Twenty hot dogs to go, please.

164
00:10:01,933 --> 00:10:03,453
Here you go.

165
00:10:03,453 --> 00:10:07,063
Teacher, Geum Ni Na's social media account is exploding.

166
00:10:07,063 --> 00:10:09,553
Lee Yeon Seo? Ugh, she's the worst.

167
00:10:09,553 --> 00:10:10,853
She's famous for that.

168
00:10:10,853 --> 00:10:13,653
I had a friend in Fantasia, and she said it was unspeakable.

169
00:10:13,653 --> 00:10:15,013
She made people cry and hit them.

170
00:10:15,013 --> 00:10:16,813
Why was she like that? Talent will fade sooner or later.

171
00:10:16,813 --> 00:10:18,643
But that inheritance is eternal.

172
00:10:18,643 --> 00:10:22,253
That's why she got her cornea transplant and behaves any way she wants.

173
00:10:22,253 --> 00:10:23,893
I'm jealous.

174
00:10:23,893 --> 00:10:27,163
Why would you be jealous of someone who gets so much hate?

175
00:10:27,163 --> 00:10:31,273
What happened to her eyes was just karma catching up to her.

176
00:10:31,273 --> 00:10:33,403
What the heck?

177
00:10:34,963 --> 00:10:37,293
 - Thank you. 
- That hardheaded idiot...

178
00:10:37,633 --> 00:10:38,583
 Thank you. 

179
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:41,903
- Did you see this? 
- SNS live broadcast? My goodness!

180
00:10:41,903 --> 00:10:43,743
- "Awful personality"? 
- "Voice Marketing."

181
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:46,153
     

182
00:10:46,153 --> 00:10:48,283
  Everyone, it's Korea's best ballerina...  

183
00:10:48,283 --> 00:10:49,993
  Seriously?  
     

184
00:10:49,993 --> 00:10:52,313
 What are you doing? 

185
00:10:52,313 --> 00:10:55,983
 - Can you see her? 
-  We prepared this surprise party... 

186
00:10:55,983 --> 00:11:00,503
  Now she can see again. Support my cousin and 

187
00:11:00,503 --> 00:11:04,313
 please give her lots of applause and hearts! 

188
00:11:04,313 --> 00:11:07,583
Is there any hope for a ballet theatre that has no dignity?

189
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,173
 I told you to get rid of that! 

190
00:11:14,323 --> 00:11:16,413
Get ready for practice.

191
00:11:17,953 --> 00:11:21,613
Director, when will Yeon Seo start coming?

192
00:11:21,613 --> 00:11:24,653
If she doesn't come, who do I pair with?

193
00:11:24,653 --> 00:11:28,593
I didn't see her name on the cast list yet. Are you sure she's going to be the leading role?

194
00:11:28,593 --> 00:11:31,033
It's our first time doing Giselle.

195
00:11:31,033 --> 00:11:34,033
Until when will we do this without a lead?

196
00:11:35,783 --> 00:11:38,823
Coveting the lead role without the talent to back it up,

197
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:42,433
and pushing blame on others to cover your own incompetence.

198
00:11:42,433 --> 00:11:44,243
Those who do such things

199
00:11:45,633 --> 00:11:49,613
are what we call delinquents. Isn't that right?

200
00:11:50,433 --> 00:11:54,693
Everybody mind your own business until I bring her back here!

201
00:11:55,693 --> 00:11:57,813
Begin the practice.

202
00:12:10,273 --> 00:12:13,963
How dare you... change the practice music?

203
00:12:13,963 --> 00:12:17,183
- I came to get you anyhow, Director. 
- Excuse me, Associate Director Geum Roo Na—

204
00:12:17,183 --> 00:12:20,983
Let's go to the conference room. There's an emergency board meeting.

205
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,913
I mean how could you humiliate us like this?

206
00:12:24,913 --> 00:12:28,413
Are you trying to use noise marketing? What's this about?

207
00:12:28,413 --> 00:12:31,213
Did our ballet theatre stoop that low?

208
00:12:31,213 --> 00:12:33,393
Is Lee Yeon Seo really going to make a return?

209
00:12:33,393 --> 00:12:39,303
The problem is that the director has remained unable to persuade Yeon Seo.

210
00:12:39,303 --> 00:12:42,613
 My word, this is ridiculous. 

211
00:12:42,613 --> 00:12:46,943
What are you going to do now? If you're going to use other people's money to support your art, then do your job properly!

212
00:12:46,943 --> 00:12:50,793
Honestly, what kind of nonsense are you trying to do when you can't even take responsibility for it!

213
00:12:50,793 --> 00:12:52,423
You have to find a solution already.

214
00:12:52,423 --> 00:12:56,653
How are you going to solve this!

215
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:00,453
I will bring her here, Lee Yeon Seo. In front of all of you—

216
00:13:00,453 --> 00:13:03,333
No, in front of the whole nation.

217
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:08,553
The ballerina who went blind in an accident. That very Lee Yeon Seo with the infamous bad temper.

218
00:13:08,553 --> 00:13:11,123
I'll have her announce her return personally at a press conference with reporters.

219
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:16,083
That should be enough for you to be able to cash in on your investments and do the business that you want.

220
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:17,473
It will be the perfect picture for that.

221
00:13:17,473 --> 00:13:20,253
- What is he saying? 
- Does that make sense?

222
00:13:20,253 --> 00:13:23,433
What if... you fail?

223
00:13:23,433 --> 00:13:27,583
Then, I'll do as you want, of course. That children's rendition of Swan Lake or whatever.

224
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,333
What? "Children's rendition"?

225
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,943
How dare he call it a children's show!

226
00:13:31,943 --> 00:13:35,193
Press conference?

227
00:13:36,823 --> 00:13:37,923
Director!

228
00:13:37,923 --> 00:13:41,493
Set up a press conference. Tell them that Lee Yeon Seo will be there to explain herself.

229
00:13:41,493 --> 00:13:46,443
What if she doesn't show? Instead of making this situation worse, why don't we just go with Ni Na?

230
00:13:48,763 --> 00:13:51,023
She will come, Lee Yeon Seo. Ah!

231
00:13:52,323 --> 00:13:58,933
And don't you dare touch my practice room, my music...

232
00:13:58,933 --> 00:14:00,813
ever again.

233
00:14:00,813 --> 00:14:06,593
It's useless anyway. The video of Yeon Seo saying rude things has already gone viral.

234
00:14:06,593 --> 00:14:10,803
It will be resolved because the person who caused it is going to fix it.

235
00:14:22,733 --> 00:14:26,663
Get a two-shot. Of you and Yeon Seo.

236
00:14:26,663 --> 00:14:30,263
With the world's brightest smiling faces.

237
00:14:30,263 --> 00:14:35,593
If possible, I want your cheeks to be stuck together.

238
00:14:35,593 --> 00:14:37,683
You're crazy!  You're crazy!

239
00:14:37,683 --> 00:14:42,203
Why would you say "Yes, I'll do it"?

240
00:14:50,563 --> 00:14:52,833
I can't. I'm scared.

241
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:55,993
 - Of what?  
- My goodness, you scared me!

242
00:14:58,143 --> 00:15:02,933
Hello. It's you, right? You were here that day, Yeon Seo's cousin?

243
00:15:02,933 --> 00:15:06,783
- Oh, you're the secretary, right? 
- Yes.

244
00:15:08,063 --> 00:15:11,233
- Mr. Secretary, please help me. 
- What?

245
00:15:11,233 --> 00:15:14,203
 Hey, cat, be quiet. 

246
00:15:16,513 --> 00:15:20,243
Oh! Oh no, she scares me. Why am I in front?

247
00:15:28,793 --> 00:15:31,253
Don't cry in front of my house.

248
00:15:40,423 --> 00:15:43,213
But, why did you run away?

249
00:15:43,213 --> 00:15:45,613
What about you?

250
00:15:45,613 --> 00:15:48,753
- I was embarrassed. 
- I was embarrassed.

251
00:15:55,733 --> 00:16:01,253
Running made me hungrier.

252
00:16:12,393 --> 00:16:13,473
Have some more.

253
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:18,933
Why don't you eat any Ms. Ni Na... Uh, can I call you Ms. Ni Na?

254
00:16:18,933 --> 00:16:22,943
Of course. That night, Yeon Seo

255
00:16:22,943 --> 00:16:26,963
was very upset because of me, wasn't she?

256
00:16:28,623 --> 00:16:34,333
She wasn't that upset at first, but I fueled the fire. I made her rage.

257
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:37,803
Is that why you got fired?

258
00:16:37,803 --> 00:16:40,613
You seem like a really good person.

259
00:16:41,393 --> 00:16:44,853
I'm sorry, I won't be of much help.

260
00:16:46,843 --> 00:16:50,053
What should I tell Director Ji?

261
00:16:50,053 --> 00:16:53,843


262
00:16:53,843 --> 00:16:57,713
This Ji Kang Woo person, what's he like?

263
00:16:58,713 --> 00:17:02,323
Why do you ask?

264
00:17:02,323 --> 00:17:06,563
Since he might end up working with the young lady, I was curious.

265
00:17:11,003 --> 00:17:14,583
I don't know. It's really strange.

266
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:18,463
When I think of him, I feel like I can say so many things about him,

267
00:17:18,463 --> 00:17:21,473
but when the time comes to talk about him, I find that I can't.

268
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:24,173
If he's a good person or a bad person,

269
00:17:24,173 --> 00:17:26,873
kind, or mean, I really don't know.

270
00:17:26,873 --> 00:17:31,983
But... there's one thing I'm sure of.

271
00:17:33,323 --> 00:17:35,563
He's really cool.

272
00:17:37,713 --> 00:17:40,593
He's a cool person.

273
00:17:47,493 --> 00:17:51,053
Goo Reum is being discharged today. Go and pick her up in the morning.

274
00:17:51,053 --> 00:17:55,163
The new security company is coming so register your fingerprints.

275
00:18:01,023 --> 00:18:04,413
- What's this? 
- These are everyone's resignation letters.

276
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:08,233
What is it you want?

277
00:18:08,263 --> 00:18:12,263
The reinstatement of the workers who were one-sidedly fired a few days prior.

278
00:18:12,263 --> 00:18:14,403
That's our condition for staying on.

279
00:18:17,923 --> 00:18:23,883
Young lady, if everyone quits right now the Ivy Mansion will come to an all stop.

280
00:18:23,883 --> 00:18:29,173
Is that right? Really? Oh my, how scary.

281
00:18:29,173 --> 00:18:33,623
Since you're all such amazing people I'm sure you'll have many offers from other places.

282
00:18:33,623 --> 00:18:35,643
I'll process your resignations.

283
00:18:35,643 --> 00:18:39,353
There's no need to transfer your duties. Leave right now.

284
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,133
Now.

285
00:18:43,293 --> 00:18:45,173
Now!

286
00:18:55,233 --> 00:18:58,823
Your resignation letter must not have been included here.

287
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:04,263
Because no place pays better than here.

288
00:19:04,263 --> 00:19:06,263
Is that all?

289
00:19:06,963 --> 00:19:09,883
What can I do? As degrading and lowly as it is,

290
00:19:09,883 --> 00:19:13,363
I'm supposed to bury my letter of resignation deep inside my heart as a member of society.

291
00:19:13,363 --> 00:19:17,753
Employees who failed at their assignments, employees who harmed the employer, I can fire all of them.

292
00:19:17,753 --> 00:19:21,273
By all means, let's be fair in treating everyone the same.

293
00:19:21,273 --> 00:19:26,083
But, Young Lady, if you keep trying to buy people with money like that,

294
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,093
you won't have anyone left.

295
00:19:28,093 --> 00:19:30,413
I have you.

296
00:19:31,283 --> 00:19:34,563
My heart is already miles away.

297
00:19:34,563 --> 00:19:37,563
Never mind. I don't need you.

298
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:44,223
♫  I wanna be your light  ♫

299
00:19:47,303 --> 00:19:52,173
♫  when you're lost in the darkness  ♫

300
00:19:52,173 --> 00:19:56,403

305
00:20:23,433 --> 00:20:25,723
Congratulations.

306
00:20:25,723 --> 00:20:26,363
What?

307
00:20:26,363 --> 00:20:28,313
I heard you're going to perform again soon.

308
00:20:28,313 --> 00:20:33,173
♫  When I see you I can feel it again  ♫

309
00:20:33,173 --> 00:20:36,103

315
00:21:06,863 --> 00:21:08,703
     

316
00:21:08,703 --> 00:21:11,053
 I'm in the lobby. 

317
00:21:50,763 --> 00:21:52,973
 How is it? 

318
00:21:52,973 --> 00:21:55,203
The fellow doing the pas de deux right now will be your partner.

319
00:21:55,203 --> 00:21:58,553
He's got good power and his lines are beautiful.

320
00:21:58,553 --> 00:22:00,073
Cancel the press conference.

321
00:22:00,073 --> 00:22:01,003
I won't.

322
00:22:01,003 --> 00:22:03,183
Mr. Ji Kang Woo!

323
00:22:09,553 --> 00:22:12,493
Y-Yeon Seo.

324
00:22:12,493 --> 00:22:14,763
Hello, I'm Kang Yi Geon.

325
00:22:14,763 --> 00:22:16,753
Find yourself another partner.

326
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:21,273
I don't know what this person told you but I'll never do it.

327
00:22:26,713 --> 00:22:30,553
Make an appearance for the reporters? I'll make the announcement myself with my cane in hand.

328
00:22:30,553 --> 00:22:34,063
That you had news I didn't agree with published without my permission,

329
00:22:35,963 --> 00:22:41,433
then everyone will see for themselves how terrible you can be.

330
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:54,963
If that's what you want, then go ahead and do that.

331
00:22:54,963 --> 00:22:59,433
Because everyone wants to get an interview with the rude princess.

332
00:22:59,433 --> 00:23:05,173
You can play right into the hands of all those people chomping at the bit for a chance to criticize you.

333
00:23:08,213 --> 00:23:10,943
Why are you doing this to me?

334
00:23:10,943 --> 00:23:12,303
I'm protecting...

335
00:23:12,303 --> 00:23:15,753
both you and Fantasia.

336
00:23:15,753 --> 00:23:17,223
- I won't do it.
- You're going to do it.

337
00:23:17,223 --> 00:23:20,603
- I said I won't do it!
- You came out alive!

338
00:23:20,603 --> 00:23:25,073
You were on the brink of death, but you survived. I believe you will have a new life.

339
00:23:25,073 --> 00:23:31,183
How strongly you held onto my hand that night, I remember it well.

340
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:34,453
So that was it.

341
00:23:40,663 --> 00:23:42,713
Here. This is my life's worth.

342
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:45,433
Tell me if it's not enough. I'll give you however much you want.

343
00:23:45,433 --> 00:23:50,463
Don't you dare bring that night as your excuse to be bossy ever again.

344
00:24:00,093 --> 00:24:01,423
Until when are you going to keep running away?

345
00:24:01,423 --> 00:24:03,673
- Move out of my way. 
 - "Your life's worth"?

346
00:24:03,673 --> 00:24:04,883
That's not even choice-worthy to me.

347
00:24:04,883 --> 00:24:07,293
Your worth in my eyes is more than dozens of billions.

348
00:24:07,293 --> 00:24:10,323
It's more than trillions!

349
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:13,733
Can you give me that much? Then I'll give up.

350
00:24:13,733 --> 00:24:16,243
Why thank you for thinking so highly of me.

351
00:24:16,243 --> 00:24:21,223
But what can I do? The Lee Yeon Seo that you remember is dead.

352
00:24:21,223 --> 00:24:25,393
Just look at me. There's no such thing as a ballerina with three legs.

353
00:24:25,393 --> 00:24:28,263
So stop pipe-dreaming and wake up.

354
00:24:38,683 --> 00:24:39,973
     

355
00:24:39,973 --> 00:24:42,193
Ballet Theatre...

356
00:24:51,063 --> 00:24:52,663
What's this?

357
00:24:52,663 --> 00:24:56,423
1, 10, 100, 1000 won...

358
00:24:56,423 --> 00:24:58,263
₩1,000,000 ($1,000)?

359
00:25:19,503 --> 00:25:21,213
Get in.

360
00:25:23,213 --> 00:25:24,833
I can't let you go by yourself.

361
00:25:24,833 --> 00:25:28,393
They're already meeting up.

362
00:25:29,183 --> 00:25:31,663
I...

363
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:36,823
It worked, that's it. It must really be fate.

364
00:25:36,823 --> 00:25:40,803
I really hate noisy situations.

365
00:25:41,593 --> 00:25:43,843
Move your car.

366
00:26:36,723 --> 00:26:39,043
Are you Ms. Lee Yeon Seo?

367
00:26:39,823 --> 00:26:42,233
- Yes? 
 - A package for you.

368
00:26:43,463 --> 00:26:45,393
What is...

369
00:26:50,133 --> 00:26:53,663
     

370
00:26:55,883 --> 00:26:58,853
     

371
00:27:07,123 --> 00:27:09,863
You received it, right?

372
00:27:09,863 --> 00:27:10,873
What is this?

373
00:27:10,873 --> 00:27:15,053
You haven't opened it yet? Take it out and sign it already.

374
00:27:15,053 --> 00:27:16,153
I said what is this?

375
00:27:16,153 --> 00:27:20,823
A power of attorney agreement. The Board members are complaining:

376
00:27:20,823 --> 00:27:25,013
"We feel insecure and nervous already with a temporary director and president,
   

377
00:27:25,013 --> 00:27:26,983
what's worse is that owner of the foundation is
   

378
00:27:26,983 --> 00:27:30,083
an ill-mannered brat hated by the nation."

379
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:34,643
Everyone knows that you clearly can't do a thing without a secretary.

380
00:27:34,643 --> 00:27:37,253
They even think the announcement that you'll be performing again is an act of deception.

381
00:27:37,253 --> 00:27:40,663
Whether it's performing or business management, they say they can't trust you for anything.

382
00:27:40,663 --> 00:27:44,363
I barely managed to resolve the issue by this. So sign it and send it back to me through express mail.

383
00:27:44,363 --> 00:27:45,703
How dare you.

384
00:27:45,703 --> 00:27:47,253
Listen, child,

385
00:27:49,163 --> 00:27:52,393
considering how rude you are to me all the time,

386
00:27:53,483 --> 00:27:56,513
I shouldn't be bothering to take your side right now.

387
00:27:56,513 --> 00:28:00,153
But since we share blood (being family), I am doing it for you.

388
00:28:02,883 --> 00:28:05,623
I already consulted with a lawyer over it.

389
00:28:05,623 --> 00:28:08,163
It's an assignment of power of attorney due to mental and physical incapacity.

390
00:28:08,163 --> 00:28:10,733
If I'm of sound mind and body then I don't have to sign it, correct?

391
00:28:10,733 --> 00:28:12,353
It could be a year

392
00:28:12,353 --> 00:28:15,623
or even two years for that to happen. That's why I'm doing this.

393
00:28:15,623 --> 00:28:18,593
Are you able to attend the press conference next week then?

394
00:28:18,593 --> 00:28:20,723
Should I just cancel this now?

395
00:28:20,723 --> 00:28:22,403
I'll be there.

396
00:28:22,403 --> 00:28:26,723
I just need to show everyone that I'm perfectly fine mentally and physically.

397
00:28:26,723 --> 00:28:27,783
I'll show you.

398
00:28:27,783 --> 00:28:31,173
If not, then I guess I'll just sign and get the agreement notarized right there and then.

399
00:28:36,683 --> 00:28:41,413
Princess, your desperate efforts are going to be in vain.

400
00:28:42,423 --> 00:28:44,463
If your bad temper can solve all the problems,

401
00:28:44,463 --> 00:28:47,883
then why would you still be using a cane?

402
00:28:57,853 --> 00:29:01,023
   

403
00:29:03,643 --> 00:29:04,843
Listen carefully.

404
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:08,423
No matter what happens, don't help me.

405
00:29:08,423 --> 00:29:10,823
Stay right there and wait.

406
00:29:14,733 --> 00:29:17,873
I am the owner of my body. I'm perfectly fine.

407
00:29:17,873 --> 00:29:21,033
My, arms, and legs, too...

408
00:29:22,153 --> 00:29:24,113
And my eyes.

409
00:29:27,663 --> 00:29:34,603


410
00:29:46,723 --> 00:29:49,463
Why isn't it working?

411
00:29:54,603 --> 00:29:56,843
 You'll have no one left. 

412
00:29:56,843 --> 00:29:58,953
 It's already become like that. 

413
00:29:58,953 --> 00:30:03,423
Fine! I don't need you all! Have a nice life!

414
00:30:03,423 --> 00:30:05,383
You jerk.
