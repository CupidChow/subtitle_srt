1
00:00:01,166 --> 00:00:02,606
   

2
00:00:07,306 --> 00:00:11,556
Then, did you fail your mission?

3
00:00:14,436 --> 00:00:16,376
I don't know yet.

4
00:00:16,996 --> 00:00:19,296
You were told to make me fall in love again,

5
00:00:19,296 --> 00:00:21,776
but you fell in love instead.

6
00:00:21,776 --> 00:00:23,976
That means you failed.

7
00:00:24,946 --> 00:00:27,106
Then, what will happen to you?

8
00:00:27,106 --> 00:00:31,606
Will you be reprimanded back in paradise?

9
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:37,466
It's not over yet. I'm looking for a way.

10
00:00:37,466 --> 00:00:38,546
What?

11
00:00:38,546 --> 00:00:41,556
To stay with you.

12
00:00:44,516 --> 00:00:48,116
I'll make sure I find it. Trust me.

13
00:00:54,676 --> 00:01:01,606


14
00:01:10,126 --> 00:01:11,626
I have a question.

15
00:01:11,626 --> 00:01:13,636
I was wondering why you suddenly called me out.

16
00:01:13,636 --> 00:01:17,346
How can I become a human?

17
00:01:17,936 --> 00:01:19,136
Let me ask you again.

18
00:01:19,136 --> 00:01:20,956
How did you...

19
00:01:21,936 --> 00:01:24,246
become a human?

20
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:29,996
Do you think I'll tell you that?

21
00:01:29,996 --> 00:01:34,436
I gave this some thought. Why did you do this?

22
00:01:34,436 --> 00:01:36,626
You knew what you did was meaningless,

23
00:01:36,626 --> 00:01:39,996
projecting a dead person's image onto Yeon Seo.

24
00:01:41,366 --> 00:01:42,846
You knew you weren't supposed to do that.

25
00:01:42,846 --> 00:01:47,476
Shut it. She isn't someone you dare to speak of.

26
00:01:52,096 --> 00:01:54,026
You were in pain.

27
00:01:55,136 --> 00:01:59,276
The pain of not being able to see the one you love.

28
00:02:01,156 --> 00:02:04,786
That's why you were obsessed and determined.

29
00:02:07,116 --> 00:02:10,426
That's all the more reason for you to understand me.

30
00:02:10,426 --> 00:02:14,756
Having a desire may seem tempting at first, but the truth is

31
00:02:14,756 --> 00:02:19,546
it's poisonous, stinging and extremely painful.

32
00:02:21,956 --> 00:02:26,786
I can endure all that because I was once a human, too.

33
00:02:28,206 --> 00:02:31,206
- What did you say? 
- The day you pushed me into the water,

34
00:02:31,206 --> 00:02:35,036
I started to remember who I was.

35
00:02:35,036 --> 00:02:41,006
Yeon Seo's first audience and the boy who watched her dance for the first time...

36
00:02:42,826 --> 00:02:44,806
was me.

37
00:02:45,786 --> 00:02:52,196
I believe it's His providence that I was sent to her and that you and I met.

38
00:02:53,456 --> 00:02:59,176
I saw many people ruined, claiming it was God's will or whatever, as they saw fit.

39
00:02:59,176 --> 00:03:01,126
You can't become human.

40
00:03:01,126 --> 00:03:06,106
Even if God permits it, I'll stop it.

41
00:03:09,906 --> 00:03:11,836
You came!

42
00:03:14,386 --> 00:03:15,766
 You can't become a human. 

43
00:03:15,766 --> 00:03:17,396
 Why not? 

44
00:03:20,776 --> 00:03:23,396
 Because Yeon Seo would have to die. 

45
00:03:32,986 --> 00:03:35,746
I got some Yuchae flower seeds,

46
00:03:35,746 --> 00:03:39,356
because I want to commemorate our meeting again.

47
00:03:39,356 --> 00:03:43,326
I heard they need to be planted in fall to bloom the following spring,

48
00:03:43,326 --> 00:03:46,616
so I am preparing it in advance.

49
00:03:49,006 --> 00:03:51,346
Next Spring?

50
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:56,316
Let's plant them this fall together.

51
00:03:56,316 --> 00:04:00,616
 Only the angels who have received true love can become humans. 

52
00:04:07,946 --> 00:04:09,686
I'll do it.

53
00:04:13,306 --> 00:04:15,936
 The love betting one's own life on and sacrificing one's self for. 

54
00:04:15,936 --> 00:04:20,466
 That is... the method to become a human. 

55
00:05:31,546 --> 00:05:34,916
 The accident three years ago, was it really a coincidence? 

56
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:37,656
 Stop the mother...? 

57
00:05:37,656 --> 00:05:40,926
- Hello. 
- Hello.

58
00:05:58,616 --> 00:06:01,736
Are you really planning to do the understudy only?

59
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,996
Yes. I am only going to dance the Giselle part.

60
00:06:04,996 --> 00:06:09,576
Don't you feel wasted after all that hard practice and you don't even get on the stage?

61
00:06:09,576 --> 00:06:11,666
I'll take care of my own business.

62
00:06:13,636 --> 00:06:19,866
Ni Na, a situation like three years ago won't happen again.

63
00:06:21,286 --> 00:06:26,366
 The accident three years ago is not a coincidence? 

64
00:06:27,046 --> 00:06:29,206
 You know it, too? 

65
00:06:29,206 --> 00:06:32,566
 Are you one of them, too? 

66
00:06:34,986 --> 00:06:37,106
What do you mean by that?

67
00:06:38,146 --> 00:06:42,866
I am telling you to forget it if you are expecting that sort.

68
00:06:47,966 --> 00:06:49,926
Yeon Seo,

69
00:06:50,976 --> 00:06:53,676
can we chat for a minute?

70
00:07:00,266 --> 00:07:01,906
What's this?

71
00:07:01,906 --> 00:07:03,846
I am sorry.

72
00:07:07,746 --> 00:07:11,836
I am sorry, Unnie. I'd have told you already.

73
00:07:18,076 --> 00:07:19,286
What are these?

74
00:07:19,286 --> 00:07:23,156
This is what Assistant Director Geum had spread before the audition, I heard.

75
00:07:24,106 --> 00:07:27,236
Are you saying she bribed you?

76
00:07:27,236 --> 00:07:30,396
I am sorry. We were about to return them.

77
00:07:30,396 --> 00:07:32,226
I only wore it once.

78
00:07:32,226 --> 00:07:35,146
They seem to have met her separately without each other's knowledge.

79
00:07:35,146 --> 00:07:41,166
They were planning to gather all of the bribes and return them. They wanted to tell you first.

80
00:07:41,876 --> 00:07:45,046
Even if you took these bribes and voted for Ni Na, I can't help it.

81
00:07:45,046 --> 00:07:49,316
It meant my dance was less than this money.

82
00:07:51,786 --> 00:07:53,626
Thanks for telling me.

83
00:07:53,626 --> 00:07:56,026
And you didn't go to the hospital, did you Jeong Eun?

84
00:07:56,026 --> 00:07:57,786
You should go now.

85
00:08:01,476 --> 00:08:04,706
Yeon Seo is awesome.

86
00:08:04,706 --> 00:08:07,696
  "Hilarion, a local gamekeeper, is also in love with Giselle and is highly suspicious of the newcomer who has won Giselle’s affections..."  

87
00:08:16,956 --> 00:08:20,936
 I think it's His will sending me to Yeon Seo. 

88
00:08:20,936 --> 00:08:24,716
 What do I have to do to become a human? 

89
00:08:30,846 --> 00:08:32,546
Yes.

90
00:08:34,356 --> 00:08:36,756
Do you have a moment?

91
00:08:43,846 --> 00:08:46,186
Because you weren't there at practice...

92
00:08:48,406 --> 00:08:50,866
I thought my presence would make you uncomfortable.

93
00:08:50,866 --> 00:08:54,326
I think it's you who is uncomfortable.

94
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:59,316
That's why I came to see you. You can't keep doing this when we are going to run into each other often.

95
00:08:59,316 --> 00:09:01,226
I came to answer you.

96
00:09:01,226 --> 00:09:05,136
I'm declining clearly and politely.

97
00:09:07,836 --> 00:09:11,656
- I'll wait. 
- No, please don't.

98
00:09:11,656 --> 00:09:13,196
I am interested in someone else.

99
00:09:13,196 --> 00:09:14,936
Human...

100
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:17,806
You know he's not.

101
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:23,936
How do you know?

102
00:09:23,936 --> 00:09:26,536


103
00:09:26,536 --> 00:09:30,946
You said to me before that I am being deceived by Dan.

104
00:09:34,356 --> 00:09:37,316
I saw it on the day you fell.

105
00:09:37,316 --> 00:09:40,846
It's probably romantic now.

106
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:43,136
With a guardian angel or whatever, it's probably dreamy.

107
00:09:43,136 --> 00:09:48,676
But you always wake up from a dream. I'll wait til then.

108
00:09:48,676 --> 00:09:51,666
I won't come to you even after waking up from that dream.

109
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:55,686
You can hate me. I'd rather you hate me.

110
00:09:55,686 --> 00:09:58,466
Please don't cause me to make a visit over this matter again.

111
00:09:58,466 --> 00:10:00,336
I am asking this of you.

112
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,436
What?

113
00:10:04,156 --> 00:10:05,816
Oh no.

114
00:10:06,696 --> 00:10:08,216
You can shoot like this.

115
00:10:08,216 --> 00:10:09,796
Okay.

116
00:10:12,086 --> 00:10:14,706
 How long do you think it'll last? 

117
00:10:15,326 --> 00:10:20,276
 There is no way that you think an angel would stay on earth forever, do you? 

118
00:10:21,446 --> 00:10:24,366
- Dan. 
- Yes?

119
00:10:24,366 --> 00:10:26,616
Don't let me get away, okay?

120
00:10:29,186 --> 00:10:30,926
Okay.

121
00:10:32,176 --> 00:10:38,216
♫  I can say anything that I want, alive  ♫

122
00:10:38,216 --> 00:10:44,496
♫  I believe in things that I see, I pray  ♫

123
00:10:45,976 --> 00:10:48,576
 The love betting one's own life on and sacrificing one's life, 

124
00:10:48,576 --> 00:10:52,736
 that is... the method to become a human.  

125
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:56,046
 Because Yeon Seo would have to die. 

126
00:10:56,046 --> 00:10:59,516
Not true. Not true.

127
00:10:59,516 --> 00:11:03,456
♫  There is a word of God  ♫

128
00:11:03,456 --> 00:11:06,866
What is? Did I look weird?

129
00:11:07,866 --> 00:11:11,596
Can you not die? Is that the only way?

130
00:11:11,596 --> 00:11:18,086
What are you talking about? Act Two will only start after Giselle dies. That's the only way for her to save Albrecht.

131
00:11:18,086 --> 00:11:21,736
No, I don't think that's what he wanted.

132
00:11:23,246 --> 00:11:27,266
Don't get too focused. It's not like I am going to die.

133
00:11:30,616 --> 00:11:32,426
I'll do it again. Shoot me well.

134
00:11:33,356 --> 00:11:35,086
Okay.

135
00:11:36,536 --> 00:11:39,706
♫  There is a word of God  ♫

136
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:53,766
Senior.

137
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:56,866
Hey, Senior!

138
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:01,266
Who are you?

139
00:12:01,266 --> 00:12:04,366
You don't have to act here. I came alone.

140
00:12:05,566 --> 00:12:08,166
- Pardon me? 
- I need to check something.

141
00:12:10,066 --> 00:12:11,466
What...?

142
00:12:15,366 --> 00:12:17,466
You are really not him?

143
00:12:17,466 --> 00:12:21,666
It's not true. I am saying it's not true!

144
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,266
Please be quiet.

145
00:12:23,266 --> 00:12:25,666
Is it something a priest should do?

146
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:28,066
If you are going to wear a trench coat (flasher), then take off your priest clothing.

147
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:30,866
If you are going to wear priest clothing, then take off your trench coat.

148
00:12:30,866 --> 00:12:32,866
No, here...

149
00:12:35,266 --> 00:12:38,666
Fine! Let's say I urinated on the street

150
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:41,566
because you all think that in your heads already.

151
00:12:41,566 --> 00:12:45,866
Still, it's not the human law to lock me up for a few days either, is it?

152
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:47,666
Be quiet!

153
00:12:48,776 --> 00:12:51,856
- Here— 
- I said to sit there!

154
00:12:54,866 --> 00:12:57,166
Excuse me, Mr. Policeman.

155
00:13:07,066 --> 00:13:08,666
To the cathedral...

156
00:13:16,466 --> 00:13:19,066
Don't you think this is too much?

157
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:25,666
Only once. It's just once. Must you go this far?

158
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:29,066
Once becomes twice and twice become three times, you know.

159
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:32,656
Who are you?

160
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:34,466
The first time is hard.

161
00:13:34,466 --> 00:13:38,866
Once you cross the line, you can't even see the line after that.

162
00:13:38,866 --> 00:13:42,866
Don't feel wronged and do as they tell you. Don't overthink it.

163
00:13:42,866 --> 00:13:45,466
It just gets complicated if you do.

164
00:13:49,466 --> 00:13:50,866
My Lord.

165
00:13:52,466 --> 00:13:54,666
Miss Park Bok Ja, come out.

166
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,466
If you eat without paying the bill again, you'll receive a harsher punishment next time.

167
00:13:57,466 --> 00:14:00,066
The world became so harsh...

168
00:14:00,066 --> 00:14:01,566
Excuse me!

169
00:14:05,286 --> 00:14:07,436
Are you the Lord?

170
00:14:08,466 --> 00:14:12,266
Do you want to go meet the Lord with me?

171
00:14:12,266 --> 00:14:15,866
Soju god, beer god, whiskey god---

172
00:14:15,866 --> 00:14:17,866
Come out quickly.

173
00:14:17,866 --> 00:14:20,866
- Why is he so fussy? 
 - Come out.

174
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:29,466
Please sit down, Father.

175
00:14:31,266 --> 00:14:33,466
Go sit at your place.

176
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:01,466
   

177
00:15:08,066 --> 00:15:09,466
   

178
00:15:09,466 --> 00:15:11,666
It's Manager Park for sure.

179
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:14,466
I think you helped him make up his mind that day.

180
00:15:14,466 --> 00:15:16,366
   

181
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:24,366
Then... shall we begin?

182
00:15:25,066 --> 00:15:28,466
 Immediate arrest will be hard since it's only circumstantial. 

183
00:15:28,466 --> 00:15:30,666
I'll check out the validity of the tip first.

184
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:35,066
Thank you, and call me if you need anything.

185
00:15:35,066 --> 00:15:41,466
 If we start from the case three years ago, we'll probably find the link to Mister's accident as well. 

186
00:15:42,366 --> 00:15:46,066
 The accident three years ago, is it really a coincidence? Stop the mother... 

187
00:15:49,606 --> 00:15:53,866
No way. Something is wrong.

188
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:09,466
You don't have practice today?

189
00:16:12,866 --> 00:16:14,366
Mom.

190
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:17,766
Mom, you love me. Right?

191
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:21,866
A mother loving her daughter is given.

192
00:16:23,356 --> 00:16:26,916
I have something to ask you—

193
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:34,866
Honey, come quickly.

194
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,466
What brings you here?

195
00:16:51,466 --> 00:16:53,066
This is your first visit to our home. Right, Yeon Seo?

196
00:16:53,066 --> 00:16:55,666
Where is Roo Na?

197
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:58,066
Uh, she rushed out not too long ago.

198
00:16:58,066 --> 00:16:59,566
Come on in.

199
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,276
Please have a seat.

200
00:17:09,466 --> 00:17:10,966
You sit, too.

201
00:17:12,566 --> 00:17:14,266
 Lay low for a while. 

202
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:17,466
Yeon Seo knows already but is putting on a show.

203
00:17:17,466 --> 00:17:18,666
I apologize.

204
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:21,466
 I'll need you soon. I'll call you. 

205
00:17:21,466 --> 00:17:23,666
I'll take care of it without any mistake.

206
00:17:27,466 --> 00:17:31,666
 Kidnapping me and threatening Moon Ji Hong three years ago, 

207
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,666
 were all done by him probably. 

208
00:17:38,466 --> 00:17:40,326
Hello.

209
00:17:42,466 --> 00:17:44,066
Glad to see you.

210
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:49,566
 Foolish man, 

211
00:17:49,566 --> 00:17:53,366
 leave evil and do good deeds. 

212
00:17:57,966 --> 00:18:01,066
 Hello, why aren't you saying anything? 

213
00:18:01,066 --> 00:18:04,166
 Joon Soo. Joon Soo. 

214
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:35,666
   

215
00:18:56,866 --> 00:18:59,866
I, from 2017 to 2019,

216
00:18:59,866 --> 00:19:03,466
was ordered by Choi Yang Ja of Fantasia Ballet

217
00:19:03,466 --> 00:19:07,666
to interfere with ballerina Lee Yeon Seo's cornea transplant donation.

218
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:09,466
How do you...?

219
00:19:09,466 --> 00:19:14,066
On the event of Fantasia Fundraising Night, I was paid by Choi Yang Ja and

220
00:19:14,066 --> 00:19:17,666
planned to cause trouble for Ballerina Lee Yeon Seo.

221
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:21,066
Although it ended with an attempt, I had a clear intention

222
00:19:21,066 --> 00:19:24,266
to harm Ballerina Lee Yeon Seo, and this is my accusation.

223
00:19:24,266 --> 00:19:26,966
Stop! Stop it.

224
00:19:29,066 --> 00:19:32,066
No. It's setup and fabricated.

225
00:19:34,266 --> 00:19:35,666
Are you crazy?

226
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:38,866
Anyone can write this on a piece of paper!

227
00:19:38,866 --> 00:19:40,866
Get out right now.

228
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,266
 But why all of a sudden, for that? 

229
00:19:53,266 --> 00:19:57,266
 A leader paying attention to the members is a given. 

230
00:19:57,266 --> 00:20:00,066
 Each vote from the members is so precious. 

231
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:03,866
 Are you trying to buy votes on the audition? 

232
00:20:03,866 --> 00:20:07,466
 Donation is a better choice of words, so why use that word? 

233
00:20:07,466 --> 00:20:09,066
 So scary.... 

234
00:20:09,066 --> 00:20:10,466
 What is this, Director? 

235
00:20:10,466 --> 00:20:14,666
 Why don't you go to see your kids in England? Three months will do, right? 

236
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:18,566
 If I go, will I disappear without anyone's knowledge, too? 

237
00:20:18,566 --> 00:20:21,366
 Like Moon Ji Hong three years ago? 

238
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:30,166
Did you bribe the members?

239
00:20:35,066 --> 00:20:36,666
Manager Park, this bastard...

240
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:39,366
Why? Are you going to kill him?

241
00:20:39,366 --> 00:20:43,066
Like Moon Ji Hong and Seung Han Cheol?

242
00:20:48,266 --> 00:20:51,866
The way I feel, I want to give it back the same way.

243
00:20:51,866 --> 00:20:54,866
At the end of a cliff in a broken car

244
00:20:54,866 --> 00:20:58,766
screaming for help like crazy. I want to make it like that,

245
00:21:01,466 --> 00:21:03,866
but I am holding back for Fantasia.

246
00:21:05,566 --> 00:21:09,066
I'll give you 24 hours. Resign on your own.

247
00:21:09,066 --> 00:21:14,066
I don't want to soil Fantasia with this dirty and ugly story.

248
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:17,066
If you don't want, in front of foundation members,

249
00:21:17,066 --> 00:21:20,866
to show a mother and daughter getting cuffed together,

250
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:27,966
you put the period mark with your own hand and with your own mouth, Aunt.

251
00:21:34,036 --> 00:21:37,116
"If the ending is good, everything is good."

252
00:21:39,116 --> 00:21:41,176
Who said that?

253
00:22:22,626 --> 00:22:26,016
     

254
00:22:28,726 --> 00:22:30,676
I just came out.

255
00:22:30,676 --> 00:22:35,076
 I know. I'm watching you now. 

256
00:22:54,056 --> 00:22:56,626
You're having a hard time, aren't you, Yeon Seo?

257
00:22:56,626 --> 00:22:58,586
It's okay.

258
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:02,276
The rain must've startled you.

259
00:23:02,276 --> 00:23:04,196
I found Moon Ji Hong's bag.

260
00:23:04,196 --> 00:23:06,146
You should be able to resolve everything.

261
00:23:06,146 --> 00:23:08,256
Are you okay? You didn't get hurt, did you?

262
00:23:08,256 --> 00:23:11,226
Lee Yeon Seo, I am an angel.

263
00:23:11,226 --> 00:23:14,186
A hundred of those can't beat me.

264
00:23:15,586 --> 00:23:19,606
 No way you'd think an angel would stay on earth forever, do you? 

265
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:21,096
♫  Little by little  ♫

266
00:23:21,096 --> 00:23:24,886
♫  Maybe by that time  ♫

267
00:23:25,826 --> 00:23:30,456
Let's stay home on rainy days for the rest of our lives.

268
00:23:30,456 --> 00:23:35,096
It's better. You'd only get your feet wet and get in a bad mood going outside when it rains.

269
00:23:35,096 --> 00:23:36,986
♫  I might have realized  ♫

270
00:23:36,986 --> 00:23:42,096
Let's stay together inside listening to the raindrops.

271
00:23:42,096 --> 00:23:45,276
Let's do that.

272
00:23:49,376 --> 00:23:54,296
♫  Tonight stars are pouring down  ♫

273
00:23:54,296 --> 00:23:57,516
♫  While I think of you alone  ♫

274
00:23:57,516 --> 00:24:02,016
♫  Will you know  ♫

275
00:24:02,016 --> 00:24:05,446
♫  I feel infatuated?  ♫

276
00:24:05,446 --> 00:24:09,436
♫  On a night when cherry blossoms are scattering  ♫

277
00:24:09,436 --> 00:24:13,216
♫  Through the warm wind under the moonlight  ♫

278
00:24:13,216 --> 00:24:18,416
♫  I long for you all alone  ♫

279
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:23,606
♫  I wish my longing could reach you  ♫

280
00:24:26,136 --> 00:24:30,806
♫  I wish this will be the end of the nights without you  ♫

281
00:24:35,986 --> 00:24:40,646
♫  Tonight stars are pouring down  ♫

282
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:44,136
♫  While I think of you alone  ♫

283
00:24:44,136 --> 00:24:46,616
♫  Will you know   ♫

284
00:24:46,616 --> 00:24:50,626
What are you looking at?

285
00:24:50,626 --> 00:24:52,126
Are you awake?

286
00:24:52,126 --> 00:24:55,866
I am ugly when I sleep.

287
00:24:55,866 --> 00:24:57,946
♫  Through the warm wind under the moonlight  ♫

288
00:24:57,946 --> 00:25:02,226
You sleeping. That's what I saw the most in this world.

289
00:25:02,226 --> 00:25:03,486
What's wrong with you?

290
00:25:03,486 --> 00:25:04,876
♫  My heart is full of you  ♫

291
00:25:04,876 --> 00:25:06,676
You are adorable.

292
00:25:06,676 --> 00:25:11,696
You are really adorable.

293
00:25:13,526 --> 00:25:16,006
♫  I long for you all alone  ♫

294
00:25:31,316 --> 00:25:33,756
 Sending me to Yeon Seo 

295
00:25:33,756 --> 00:25:36,256
 and making me meet you, 

296
00:25:37,496 --> 00:25:39,556
 I think it's all His will. 

297
00:25:39,556 --> 00:25:43,176
 I won't come to you even when I wake up from that dream. 

298
00:26:31,466 --> 00:26:33,616
Yes, this is Lee Yeon Seo.

299
00:26:33,616 --> 00:26:35,526
Come out.

300
00:26:35,526 --> 00:26:37,356
I won't see you personally.

301
00:26:37,356 --> 00:26:41,536
I have something to tell you about Kim Dan.

302
00:26:53,096 --> 00:26:55,986
    

303
00:26:58,006 --> 00:26:58,906
Uhm.

304
00:26:58,906 --> 00:27:01,016
 Where are you? 

305
00:27:01,016 --> 00:27:05,386
You are not in the practice room or in your room. Where are you?

306
00:27:05,386 --> 00:27:07,756
I am out for a stroll.

307
00:27:07,756 --> 00:27:09,576
I saw Gureum at home. Did you go for a stroll by yourself?

308
00:27:09,576 --> 00:27:13,676
I need to buy something. It's just across the street.

309
00:27:15,666 --> 00:27:17,946
I'll be home soon. Don't worry.

310
00:27:17,946 --> 00:27:19,956
Call me. I'll meet up with you.

311
00:27:19,956 --> 00:27:21,686
Uhm.

312
00:27:31,486 --> 00:27:34,576
I came because I have something to ask.

313
00:27:34,576 --> 00:27:37,566
About what you said before, what does it mean?

314
00:27:37,566 --> 00:27:40,576
What you said about angels can't stay on earth forever.

315
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:44,516
It's what it means literally. What more could it be?

316
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:51,176
He returns... to Heaven.

317
00:27:53,656 --> 00:27:55,086
Why are you laughing?

318
00:27:55,086 --> 00:27:59,436
Then you'll stop it now, right?

319
00:27:59,436 --> 00:28:02,756
He comes down as he wishes and goes up as he wishes.

320
00:28:02,756 --> 00:28:08,236
You are not foolish enough to hold on to him. Right, Yeon Seo?

321
00:28:08,236 --> 00:28:10,506
People die, too.

322
00:28:10,506 --> 00:28:13,116
No one can stay by your side forever.

323
00:28:13,116 --> 00:28:15,416
I know that quite well.

324
00:28:15,416 --> 00:28:20,726
If we don't have much time given, then I'll love him more

325
00:28:20,726 --> 00:28:23,116
so I won't regret.

326
00:28:27,816 --> 00:28:29,766
Who says he'll return to Heaven?

327
00:28:29,766 --> 00:28:33,616
Did Kim Dan say that? It's your assumption.

328
00:28:33,616 --> 00:28:36,676
Because angels can't lie,

329
00:28:36,676 --> 00:28:39,936
he'd not have said he'll return to Heaven.

330
00:28:39,936 --> 00:28:42,546
Don't beat around the bush. What does it mean?

331
00:28:42,546 --> 00:28:46,896
Like dust, like powder...

332
00:28:48,156 --> 00:28:50,266
He'll disappear.

333
00:28:52,176 --> 00:28:53,886
Why?

334
00:28:55,636 --> 00:28:56,446
Why?

335
00:28:56,446 --> 00:28:59,366
God is very jealous.

336
00:28:59,366 --> 00:29:01,646
He doesn't want what's His to be taken by others.

337
00:29:01,646 --> 00:29:06,636
Kim Dan will be extinguished

338
00:29:06,636 --> 00:29:08,956
because you love him.

339
00:29:16,026 --> 00:29:19,516
♫  The lives we play behind  ♫

340
00:29:19,516 --> 00:29:22,786
 It's not over yet. I'm still looking 

341
00:29:22,786 --> 00:29:25,416
 to find a way to stay with you. 

342
00:29:25,416 --> 00:29:28,446
♫  of pain  ♫

343
00:29:28,446 --> 00:29:31,496
♫  Our minds belong  ♫

344
00:29:31,496 --> 00:29:34,516
♫  to those who risk  ♫

345
00:29:34,516 --> 00:29:36,256
♫  To those who seek  ♫

346
00:29:36,256 --> 00:29:41,356
 Kim Dan will be extinguished 

347
00:29:41,356 --> 00:29:43,456
 because you love him. 

348
00:29:43,456 --> 00:29:49,666
♫  I can say anything that I want, alive  ♫

349
00:29:49,666 --> 00:29:50,776
♫  I believe in things  ♫

350
00:29:50,776 --> 00:29:53,006
 I am confessing. 

351
00:29:53,006 --> 00:29:58,266
 You said to look at the human, but I long for that human. 

352
00:29:58,266 --> 00:30:04,276
 You said to see what's inside the human, but I keep looking at my own insides. 

353
00:30:04,276 --> 00:30:08,316
 From my insides, my soul 

354
00:30:08,316 --> 00:30:10,696
 starts talking to me. 

355
00:30:10,696 --> 00:30:13,626
 I want to ask for the first time. 

356
00:30:15,026 --> 00:30:19,056
 Why am I not a human? 

357
00:30:19,056 --> 00:30:23,856
 Why am I here, and she is there? 

358
00:30:35,306 --> 00:30:39,866
 Can we be the angels to each other? 

359
00:30:39,866 --> 00:30:45,576
 No, if possible, I want to be a human to her. 

360
00:30:47,326 --> 00:30:51,376
 I want to be a human who can hug her with warmth. 

361
00:30:51,376 --> 00:30:52,916
 Then, what will happen to you now? 

362
00:30:52,916 --> 00:30:55,866
 You'll be scolded in Heaven? 

363
00:30:55,866 --> 00:30:58,416
 "Everything is fine." 

364
00:30:58,416 --> 00:31:02,086
 I want to be a human who can lie. 

365
00:31:02,086 --> 00:31:07,536
 I want to be a human who can forget painful memories from time to time. 

366
00:31:07,536 --> 00:31:13,376
 If cut by a knife and dripping blood, she'll get startled and blow on my wound. 

367
00:31:13,376 --> 00:31:16,026
 I want to be that human. 

368
00:31:16,026 --> 00:31:18,966
 Fragile, like glass, and weak, and 

369
00:31:18,966 --> 00:31:23,316
 all messed up, but I want to be the human  

370
00:31:23,316 --> 00:31:27,636
 who can love with his life on the line. 

371
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:30,226
 I, too, want to put my life on the line 

372
00:31:30,226 --> 00:31:32,826
  and love. 

373
00:31:32,826 --> 00:31:37,876
 Is that possible? 

374
00:31:37,876 --> 00:31:40,696
 I'll find a way. 

375
00:31:40,696 --> 00:31:46,056
 Without Yeon Seo's life or Yeon Seo's sacrifice as the collateral, 

376
00:31:46,056 --> 00:31:50,496
 I'll definitely find a way to keep her alive. 

377
00:31:51,646 --> 00:31:57,746
 Even if it means turning my back on you. 

378
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:20,666
What's wrong with your face? Did you cry?

379
00:32:21,666 --> 00:32:28,686


380
00:32:29,466 --> 00:32:32,706
Why? What happened?

381
00:32:35,496 --> 00:32:38,536
Nothing happened.

382
00:32:38,536 --> 00:32:44,236
I just... missed you

383
00:32:44,236 --> 00:32:45,456
so much.

384
00:32:45,456 --> 00:32:49,686
♫  Even if I lost everything  ♫

385
00:32:49,686 --> 00:32:51,976
Me, too.

386
00:32:51,976 --> 00:32:54,566
I missed you, too.

387
00:32:54,566 --> 00:32:59,746
♫  It's all right. It's all right   ♫

388
00:32:59,746 --> 00:33:07,166
♫  Because someone is by your side   ♫

389
00:33:08,526 --> 00:33:12,166
♫  Even when I am crying   ♫

390
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:15,926
♫  Feeling all alone and lonely   ♫

391
00:33:15,926 --> 00:33:21,706
♫  The person who'll stand by me   ♫

392
00:33:21,706 --> 00:33:24,886
♫  My love   ♫

393
00:33:26,226 --> 00:33:29,496
♫  You are my angel   ♫

394
00:33:29,496 --> 00:33:35,076
♫  Oh, you are my angel always   ♫

395
00:33:36,296 --> 00:33:40,416
♫   You're here   ♫

396
00:33:40,416 --> 00:33:43,986
♫  Oh, you are my angel   ♫

00:33:51,086 --> 00:33:55,266
♫  Always stay here forever   ♫

399
00:33:55,266 --> 00:34:00,706
 I am not going to pretend like I don't like him when I do. 

400
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:03,566
 Come to the living room in 30 minutes. We are going on a picnic. 

401
00:34:03,566 --> 00:34:05,146
 Wait and see who wins. 

402
00:34:05,146 --> 00:34:09,356
 I am going to do everything I want with Kim Dan. 

403
00:34:09,356 --> 00:34:11,826
 How did you become a human? 

404
00:34:11,826 --> 00:34:14,256
 Everything will disappear? 

405
00:34:14,256 --> 00:34:16,116
 She's crying because of you! 

406
00:34:16,116 --> 00:34:19,066
 You'll end up destroyed like me! 

407
00:34:19,066 --> 00:34:24,856
 Dan, since the weather is nice, how about if we get married? 

408
00:34:26,836 --> 00:34:28,065
♫  Even when I am crying  ♫
