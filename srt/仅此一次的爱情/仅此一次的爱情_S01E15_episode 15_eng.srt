1
00:00:09,774 --> 00:00:11,534
 Lee Yeon Seo! 

2
00:00:32,734 --> 00:00:35,624
 This is a dream, isn't it? 

3
00:00:36,334 --> 00:00:37,914
 Yes. 

4
00:00:39,194 --> 00:00:42,434
 Then inside this dream, why don't we 

5
00:00:42,434 --> 00:00:45,784
 take pictures until we're old and hunched. 

6
00:00:46,874 --> 00:00:48,654
 Look forward. 

7
00:00:51,854 --> 00:00:53,324
 Take it. 

8
00:01:30,604 --> 00:01:34,594
Just a little more sleep. I can do it.

9
00:01:35,164 --> 00:01:39,474
Continue...

10
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,094
Continue...

11
00:01:43,194 --> 00:01:46,524
Just a minute more would have done it. Oh my god!

12
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:48,384
What am I doing right now?

13
00:01:48,384 --> 00:01:50,664
Ah, Yeon Seo, you must be crazy.

14
00:01:50,664 --> 00:01:54,184
♫   One, two, a one two three four   ♫

15
00:01:58,484 --> 00:02:07,864
♫   I will never forget the way you rescued
 me from summer heat   ♫

16
00:02:07,864 --> 00:02:09,894
I made an extra because there were ingredients left over.

17
00:02:09,894 --> 00:02:11,834
It's not as if I could throw it out.

18
00:02:13,764 --> 00:02:16,214
He'll catch on, won't he?

19
00:02:19,254 --> 00:02:23,844
♫  Oh, wouldn't it be better  ♫

20
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:25,994
♫   if we...   ♫

21
00:02:25,994 --> 00:02:27,104
   

22
00:02:27,104 --> 00:02:29,684
Are you here?  Let's eat breakfast.

23
00:02:29,684 --> 00:02:31,814
It's a lot better than yesterday's.

24
00:02:33,324 --> 00:02:36,334
Where did you come from, so early in the morning? Would you like some water?

25
00:02:36,334 --> 00:02:40,604
Miss,  I have something to say.

26
00:02:40,604 --> 00:02:42,844
Something important.

27
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:48,274
- What is it? 
- I...

28
00:02:49,604 --> 00:02:52,044
I will resign from being your secretary.

29
00:02:52,044 --> 00:02:56,114
I want to leave this house.

30
00:02:56,114 --> 00:02:58,224
What?

31
00:02:58,224 --> 00:03:00,424
Wh-What are you t-talking about?

32
00:03:00,424 --> 00:03:02,694
Thank you for having me so far.

33
00:03:14,714 --> 00:03:16,004
Why?!

34
00:03:16,004 --> 00:03:19,484
You must have a reason. Why are you being like this all of a sudden?

35
00:03:21,674 --> 00:03:23,814
- I'm sorry. 
- What nonsense!

36
00:03:23,814 --> 00:03:26,944
What did you say to me? That I would never be alone, no matter what choice I make?

37
00:03:26,944 --> 00:03:28,564
Didn't you say that you hated seeing me having a hard time?!

38
00:03:28,564 --> 00:03:32,444
Was it all a lie? Did you change your mind in the span of a day?

39
00:03:33,454 --> 00:03:37,544
Why are you running away? What are you afraid of?

40
00:03:37,544 --> 00:03:41,864
 My feelings. Your feelings. 

41
00:03:43,464 --> 00:03:45,024
You're hardly alone.

42
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:48,284
You have Butler and Director Ji. Even without me, you'll definitely—

43
00:03:48,284 --> 00:03:50,434
I heard everything you said!

44
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,574
You said you liked me.

45
00:03:53,574 --> 00:03:56,124
You said you couldn't help but like me.

46
00:03:56,724 --> 00:04:01,244
 I... shouldn't fall for you. 

47
00:04:02,354 --> 00:04:07,464
 And I can't even stay by your side forever. 

48
00:04:07,464 --> 00:04:11,874
 That's... really hard. 

49
00:04:11,874 --> 00:04:15,784
 Lee Yeon Seo, 

50
00:04:17,004 --> 00:04:19,304
 how can I not like you? 

51
00:04:45,644 --> 00:04:47,534
Why shouldn't you fall for me?

52
00:04:47,534 --> 00:04:51,814
Why not me? You are human and I am human, too.

53
00:04:53,394 --> 00:04:56,594
I thought you would be courageous and tell me.

54
00:04:56,594 --> 00:04:58,694
I told myself to whine at you.

55
00:04:58,694 --> 00:05:03,794
Even if you said you didn't like me, people show their true self through their actions.

56
00:05:03,794 --> 00:05:05,734
But you always...

57
00:05:06,784 --> 00:05:09,864
  You look the prettiest when you dance. 

58
00:05:11,284 --> 00:05:14,694
  You accomplished it yourself. Good Job. 

59
00:05:20,034 --> 00:05:22,324
You were nice to me.

60
00:05:22,324 --> 00:05:23,984
Isn't that right?

61
00:05:27,444 --> 00:05:30,114
Liking someone...

62
00:05:30,114 --> 00:05:33,184
Yes, I do like you.

63
00:05:33,184 --> 00:05:36,514
But that's a deviation for me.

64
00:05:36,514 --> 00:05:40,454
Just something that's passing by. Do you know how long forever is?

65
00:05:40,454 --> 00:05:44,174
Compared to that: one month, two months.

66
00:05:44,174 --> 00:05:46,994
It's not even worth mentioning.

67
00:05:46,994 --> 00:05:48,594
Then why did you say it was difficult for you?

68
00:05:48,594 --> 00:05:51,454
You said you were suffering. You said it was painful because you shouldn't like me but you do.

69
00:05:51,454 --> 00:05:53,314
Forget I said that. It was drunk talk.

70
00:05:53,314 --> 00:05:57,354
- What I said while drunk is meaningless. 
- What?

71
00:05:57,354 --> 00:05:59,464
I was your assistant for making you walk.

72
00:05:59,464 --> 00:06:02,434
You can now walk well and even dance.

73
00:06:02,434 --> 00:06:04,374
Now you...

74
00:06:05,494 --> 00:06:07,554
don't need me anymore.

75
00:06:09,774 --> 00:06:13,534
Are you done talking?

76
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:16,564
Yes.

77
00:06:17,994 --> 00:06:20,224
  Good morni— 

78
00:06:20,224 --> 00:06:24,294
You're right. You've always been useless.

79
00:06:24,294 --> 00:06:26,254
I must have been delusional.

80
00:06:26,254 --> 00:06:29,854
All right. Resign. And while we're on the subject,

81
00:06:29,854 --> 00:06:32,874
pack your belongings and leave immediately!

82
00:06:41,494 --> 00:06:43,694
What kind of situation is this, Miss?

83
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:46,194
Accept Kim Dan's resignation and terminate his contract.

84
00:06:46,194 --> 00:06:49,044
Calculate the number of hours he worked accurately and give him every penny.

85
00:06:49,044 --> 00:06:52,624
Do everything for him that we can do so that there's nothing left to be uneasy over,

86
00:06:52,624 --> 00:06:55,234
so that we never need to see each other ever again!!

87
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:12,664
Gosh, seriously! What is going on?

88
00:07:12,664 --> 00:07:16,794
You two aren't even dating but you two are playing games periodically.

89
00:07:16,794 --> 00:07:18,764
It's the second time in this room!

90
00:07:18,764 --> 00:07:21,404
I won't be coming back.

91
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:24,974
You can quit, but you have to hand over your duties.

92
00:07:24,974 --> 00:07:29,684
According to your contract, you must give notice a month in advance and secure your replacement before you leave.

93
00:07:29,684 --> 00:07:31,684
The young lady told me to leave right away.

94
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:36,794
Oh my. Since when did you listen to what she says so well?

95
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:03,724
Just go.

96
00:08:31,884 --> 00:08:36,164
 Hey. You and Yeon Seo belong to two worlds. 

97
00:08:36,164 --> 00:08:38,854
I know that better than anyone!

98
00:08:40,684 --> 00:08:43,354
Right, you can't lie.

99
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:48,254
     

100
00:08:54,214 --> 00:08:56,194
Where are you? Let's meet right now.

101
00:08:56,194 --> 00:08:58,554
 Director, it's Butler Chung. 

102
00:08:58,554 --> 00:09:00,664
Why are you answering the phone?

103
00:09:00,664 --> 00:09:02,044
Is Kim Dan not there?

104
00:09:02,044 --> 00:09:05,804
Uh, about that... Mr. Dan just quit.

105
00:09:05,804 --> 00:09:09,464
 He handed in the cell phone and pager before he left, so... 

106
00:09:09,464 --> 00:09:11,074
Today? So suddenly?

107
00:09:11,074 --> 00:09:14,404
They'd squabbled and talked about firing and returning.

108
00:09:14,404 --> 00:09:16,384
 This time it looks like it's for real. 

109
00:09:16,384 --> 00:09:20,714
He left in a hurry without handing over  his responsibilities, as if he was being chased. 

110
00:09:20,714 --> 00:09:23,924
 What on earth happened between those two? 

111
00:09:28,274 --> 00:09:30,734
Happiness, huh?

112
00:09:30,734 --> 00:09:33,674
Behaving as if he was going to be with her forever.

113
00:09:34,554 --> 00:09:36,604
Then he quit?

114
00:10:15,804 --> 00:10:21,454
It's said that a fire will burn the forest and become a blaze that swallows the mountain.

115
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:25,254
You must take refuge until the fire burns out.

116
00:10:38,884 --> 00:10:40,814
My goodness, brother!

117
00:10:41,694 --> 00:10:43,764
You came again?

118
00:10:46,034 --> 00:10:49,614
You come by last night and this morning, too.

119
00:10:49,614 --> 00:10:52,364
You must be very devout, or

120
00:10:52,364 --> 00:10:56,244
is it that you're full of worry?

121
00:10:56,244 --> 00:11:00,374
A priest shouldn't talk like a fortune-teller.

122
00:11:00,374 --> 00:11:04,644
I came looking for someone. Where is Kim Dan?

123
00:11:05,284 --> 00:11:06,964
I don't know.

124
00:11:06,964 --> 00:11:10,964
Oh... Br-Brother...

125
00:11:31,244 --> 00:11:35,974
Why do you not believe me? Kim Dan is not here.

126
00:11:35,974 --> 00:11:40,824
When you're consumed by doubt, you don't believe fermented soybean paste is made of soybeans.

127
00:11:40,824 --> 00:11:45,124
A man with too much doubt can only be unhappy.

128
00:11:45,124 --> 00:11:48,734
Yes, doubting and guessing.

129
00:11:48,734 --> 00:11:52,524
It's exhausting. I like things to be clear.

130
00:11:52,524 --> 00:11:58,934
Then I pray that you recover your faith soon.

131
00:11:58,934 --> 00:12:02,284
Yes. That's why I plan to...

132
00:12:03,434 --> 00:12:05,594
be strong and check.

133
00:12:24,124 --> 00:12:27,754
I will accept this gift from you.

134
00:12:27,754 --> 00:12:32,024
I was right. I knew you weren't an average priest.

135
00:12:32,024 --> 00:12:37,534
At the store, church, here and there. You were busy looking out for your junior angel.

136
00:12:38,754 --> 00:12:41,264
What are you doing to Lee Yeon Seo?

137
00:12:41,264 --> 00:12:45,564
It's not something a mere human can handle.

138
00:12:46,684 --> 00:12:48,144
You think your lot are special.

139
00:12:48,144 --> 00:12:53,264
You look down on the struggling humans and manipulate them with a snap of your fingers. That makes you feel

140
00:12:53,264 --> 00:12:57,654
like the omniscient and omnipotent God. You're mistaken.

141
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,374
Why are you not surprised?

142
00:13:02,374 --> 00:13:07,294
When facing an other-worldly being, humans tremble in fear and can't make eye contact.

143
00:13:07,294 --> 00:13:11,734
But instead of trembling in fear, you're angry.

144
00:13:11,734 --> 00:13:13,404
Why is that?

145
00:13:13,404 --> 00:13:17,084
Ask your petty God why I'm like this.

146
00:13:17,084 --> 00:13:20,164
And whether it's Lee Yeon Seo or Kim Dan,

147
00:13:20,164 --> 00:13:25,954
if He wants to ruin my plans again, tell Him to give up as well.

148
00:13:35,004 --> 00:13:37,934
He's not just any rib.

149
00:13:48,664 --> 00:13:51,974
What are you thinking?

150
00:13:51,974 --> 00:13:55,984
Can Dan deal with this?

151
00:13:55,984 --> 00:14:03,564
♫  I can see everything turn away from me  ♫

152
00:14:05,214 --> 00:14:09,284
♫  There is a word of God  ♫

153
00:14:18,404 --> 00:14:21,354
Can I say "at last"?

154
00:14:22,464 --> 00:14:27,734
The day you and I get to face Fantasia like we wanted, at last.

155
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:29,554
I agree.

156
00:14:30,804 --> 00:14:33,254
It seemed like the day would never come.

157
00:14:33,854 --> 00:14:36,464
Congratulations on your return, officially.

158
00:14:36,464 --> 00:14:39,754
Thank you, officially.

159
00:14:45,374 --> 00:14:49,184
Isn't it just for show? The director will judge our auditions.

160
00:14:49,184 --> 00:14:51,574
That's right. I think we quit protesting too soon.

161
00:14:51,574 --> 00:14:54,334
 - Didn't we? 
- I think so. 

162
00:15:00,964 --> 00:15:05,724
What? Do you have something to say? You have a private changing room.

163
00:15:05,724 --> 00:15:09,154
I won't use that. We still have to audition.

164
00:15:09,154 --> 00:15:11,784
I won't take any special treatment.

165
00:15:17,734 --> 00:15:21,754
She barges in and expects one of us to empty our lockers.

166
00:15:25,854 --> 00:15:28,834
Not mine. I had it for two years.

167
00:15:28,834 --> 00:15:32,634
Me too, and I have all these stickers on.

168
00:15:46,814 --> 00:15:51,304
I'll use this one here. Thank you all for coming.

169
00:15:51,304 --> 00:15:53,354
I hope we can get along.

170
00:16:17,664 --> 00:16:19,124
  Good morning.  

171
00:16:19,124 --> 00:16:21,834
- Hello.
 - Hello.

172
00:16:23,034 --> 00:16:26,104
Warm up properly and we'll start on the barre.

173
00:16:41,414 --> 00:16:43,424
What is it? We're about to start practice.

174
00:16:43,424 --> 00:16:46,414
Before you start practicing for "Giselle,"

175
00:16:46,414 --> 00:16:51,084
I came to see our dignity-less dancers (because they came back to protect their jobs).

176
00:16:51,084 --> 00:16:53,134
Did you enjoy your break?

177
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:57,974
But then, you did nothing wrong.

178
00:16:57,974 --> 00:17:01,834
I'm on your side. You all know that, don't you?

179
00:17:01,834 --> 00:17:06,374
For that reason, our associate director will make an important announcement.

180
00:17:06,374 --> 00:17:08,524
For your sake.

181
00:17:10,064 --> 00:17:14,174
The audition to pick the lead for "Giselle" will take place in the grand theatre in two weeks.

182
00:17:14,174 --> 00:17:18,494
The artistic staff such as the general director and the associate director will judge you.

183
00:17:18,494 --> 00:17:20,304
Also...

184
00:17:21,894 --> 00:17:25,634
Artistic Director Ji Kang Woo is dropped as a judge.

185
00:17:29,364 --> 00:17:34,134
What are you saying? I can't pick the lead of the performance I'm directing?

186
00:17:34,134 --> 00:17:36,864
As you also know...

187
00:17:37,544 --> 00:17:40,844
you are in no position to play fair.

188
00:17:41,864 --> 00:17:45,364
You wanted an equal and fair audition.

189
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:47,504
Do you object, Yeon Seo?

190
00:17:55,184 --> 00:17:59,434
Sounds good; I'll drop out as a judge. Instead,

191
00:17:59,434 --> 00:18:04,224
you should also step down. You're also incapable of being impartial.

192
00:18:04,224 --> 00:18:08,294
How about we let the dancers judge each other?

193
00:18:14,234 --> 00:18:18,434
In what audition in the world do you let dancers judge each other?

194
00:18:18,434 --> 00:18:20,944
Why can't we? It's transparent and fair.

195
00:18:20,944 --> 00:18:25,214
We can let everyone vote. You said you're on their side.

196
00:18:37,854 --> 00:18:42,554
All right then. What an interesting audition it will be.

197
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:46,324
And I'm sure this will go down in the history of Fantasia.

198
00:18:55,414 --> 00:18:59,034
You can't announce anything like that without discussing it with me first.

199
00:18:59,034 --> 00:19:03,594
It's you who are plotting against me with Yeon Seo behind my back.

200
00:19:03,594 --> 00:19:05,844
Fantasia isn't some corner shop you can find at a market.

201
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:09,404
It was she who suggested having an audition without discussing it with me.

202
00:19:09,404 --> 00:19:13,054
She persuaded the corps in the most reasonable way.

203
00:19:13,054 --> 00:19:14,064
Is there a problem?

204
00:19:14,064 --> 00:19:16,624
Or do you want there to be a problem?

205
00:19:16,624 --> 00:19:18,484
Please watch your language.

206
00:19:18,484 --> 00:19:22,474
Because you stubbornly didn't listen to us, the press conference and the Fantasia Night

207
00:19:22,474 --> 00:19:25,454
were totally ruined. Have you forgotten?

208
00:19:25,454 --> 00:19:29,834
General Director Choi had to jump through hoops to clean up the mess.

209
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:32,014
Associate Director Geum, that's enough.

210
00:19:32,014 --> 00:19:33,234
I'm not sure about that.

211
00:19:33,234 --> 00:19:38,234
Actually, I only remember her making this worse than it had to be and driving Yeon Seo into a corner.

212
00:19:38,234 --> 00:19:40,054
But I'll trust you a little more

213
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:43,954
because she and I have the same goal.

214
00:19:43,954 --> 00:19:46,424
Look forward to the show.

215
00:19:52,084 --> 00:19:54,344
Why did you get him all riled up? What's your plan?

216
00:19:54,344 --> 00:19:59,254
No matter how distinguished he is, he's just an artistic director.

217
00:19:59,254 --> 00:20:02,394
I can't put up with his treatment of us.

218
00:20:50,564 --> 00:20:53,304
All right. We'll start with "Giselle."

219
00:20:53,304 --> 00:20:56,304
Act one. We'll start

220
00:20:56,304 --> 00:21:00,994
from the coincidental meeting between a country girl, Giselle and Duke Albrecht.

221
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:08,824
 I know you're standing right there. 

222
00:21:10,914 --> 00:21:15,474
 When they recognized each other, they fell in love. 

223
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:17,694
 It was like that from the beginning. 

224
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:22,384
 The feeling was so intense that they wanted to call it destiny. 

225
00:21:27,064 --> 00:21:28,824
 However, 

226
00:21:28,824 --> 00:21:33,584
 when Giselle found out the man's true identity, she died from a heart attack 

227
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:36,044
 with a sense of betrayal. 

228
00:21:43,444 --> 00:21:47,974
 However, they couldn't stop loving each other even in death. 

229
00:21:50,064 --> 00:21:53,584
 And they met again. Like destiny. 

230
00:21:53,584 --> 00:21:55,584
Lee Yeon Seo.

231
00:21:57,994 --> 00:22:00,504
What did I just say?

232
00:22:03,704 --> 00:22:08,704
I've never heard of "Giselle" where she had a tragic end. She's known as the symbol of forgiveness.

233
00:22:08,704 --> 00:22:12,034
The highlight of the story is that she even saves Albrecht even in death.

234
00:22:12,034 --> 00:22:14,744
I wouldn't have even started this project if it was going to be predictable.

235
00:22:14,744 --> 00:22:18,464
Why would she forgive the man who deceived her and caused her to die?

236
00:22:18,464 --> 00:22:19,894
That story is too outdated.

237
00:22:19,894 --> 00:22:23,214
In Act two of our "Giselle," the spirit of Giselle

238
00:22:23,214 --> 00:22:27,574
is going to kill the man who drove her into death.

239
00:22:27,574 --> 00:22:29,554
As two of them dance,

240
00:22:29,554 --> 00:22:33,344
together in the world of eternal death,

241
00:22:33,344 --> 00:22:35,334
the show ends.

242
00:22:40,284 --> 00:22:42,604
That's nice.

243
00:22:42,604 --> 00:22:48,314
The man deceived her, but Giselle acted like a fool till the end. I didn't like that part.

244
00:22:48,314 --> 00:22:50,954
I like that ending.

245
00:22:53,374 --> 00:22:56,784
We'll start from the grave scene.

246
00:23:11,314 --> 00:23:13,074
Hey, no!

247
00:23:29,004 --> 00:23:31,674
What's taking him so long?

248
00:23:31,674 --> 00:23:34,614
   

249
00:23:43,324 --> 00:23:45,434
Manager Park!

250
00:23:47,094 --> 00:23:50,784
Manager Park? Manager Park.

251
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,754
Manager Park!

252
00:23:51,754 --> 00:23:53,684
Manager Park!

253
00:23:53,684 --> 00:23:56,314
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

254
00:23:56,314 --> 00:23:58,154
Manager Park!

255
00:23:58,154 --> 00:24:00,064
Hey!

256
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:05,664
So, you're telling me someone snatched the bag with all the evidence you gathered so far?

257
00:24:05,664 --> 00:24:07,514
Do you expect me to believe that?

258
00:24:07,514 --> 00:24:08,754
I'm really sorry.

259
00:24:08,754 --> 00:24:09,874
What about the backup?

260
00:24:09,874 --> 00:24:11,924
I'm sure you must've saved the original documents somewhere else.

261
00:24:11,924 --> 00:24:14,864
I'm sure someone is watching me. They won't leave me alone.

262
00:24:14,864 --> 00:24:18,364
Manager Park! Get yourself together.

263
00:24:18,364 --> 00:24:23,334
If you don't gather up your courage, you'll have to live in the fiery pit forever.

264
00:24:23,334 --> 00:24:25,714
I'm sorry, Ms. Jeong. I'm sorry.

265
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,874
Manager Park.

266
00:24:27,874 --> 00:24:30,054
Manager Park!

267
00:24:38,554 --> 00:24:41,064
   

268
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:45,644
I doubt that he'll try anything now. I'll keep watching him.

269
00:24:45,644 --> 00:24:48,034
When there's an earthquake and the ground is shaking,

270
00:24:48,034 --> 00:24:52,614
covering your head and hiding under the desk is the right thing to do.

271
00:24:53,334 --> 00:24:56,634
Still, he should've stayed under the desk.

272
00:24:56,634 --> 00:24:58,234
That way, he wouldn't have to face the damage.

273
00:24:58,234 --> 00:25:00,384
Good job.

274
00:25:02,304 --> 00:25:04,784
 I got you. 

275
00:25:11,484 --> 00:25:17,984
   

276
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:31,454
I didn't think you'd come back.

277
00:25:31,454 --> 00:25:34,234
I wanted to see her one last time.

278
00:25:34,234 --> 00:25:37,504
I might end up going somewhere far away.

279
00:25:37,504 --> 00:25:40,924
That's so nice of you. I was going to call you anyway.

280
00:25:40,924 --> 00:25:43,684
It was hectic that day. I didn't get to thank you properly.

281
00:25:43,684 --> 00:25:47,284
If it hadn't been for you, it would've been awful.

282
00:25:47,284 --> 00:25:49,304
And you know the old man, Kim Seo?

283
00:25:49,304 --> 00:25:53,594
I think he might have lost his footing, but we couldn't find his body or any traces.

284
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:56,244
Did you see anything that day?

285
00:25:57,684 --> 00:26:01,014
He might have gone somewhere far away.

286
00:26:01,014 --> 00:26:02,754
You think so?

287
00:26:02,754 --> 00:26:06,574
He did come back a year ago out of the blue, too.

288
00:26:07,354 --> 00:26:11,234
A year ago? Not 30 years?

289
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:14,084
 You must've done this a lot. You're a pro. 

290
00:26:14,084 --> 00:26:19,234
 When I see Mi Wook eating delicious food and chewing it with that small mouth, 

291
00:26:19,234 --> 00:26:22,114
 I'm the happiest. 

292
00:26:23,554 --> 00:26:27,034
 I can't imagine that. Loving someone during your entire life. 

293
00:26:27,034 --> 00:26:29,764
 You don't need to spend a long time for it to be true love. 

294
00:26:29,764 --> 00:26:34,774
 If you can give her love that can amount to 1000 years' worth of love, that's all. 

295
00:26:36,214 --> 00:26:38,664
Let me go get the doctor.

296
00:26:43,484 --> 00:26:45,334
Ma'am.

297
00:26:47,044 --> 00:26:50,394
I'm here. Can you hear my voice?

298
00:26:52,794 --> 00:26:54,974
- Let me take a look. 
- Okay.

299
00:27:01,924 --> 00:27:03,394
 No, ma'am. 

300
00:27:03,394 --> 00:27:06,734
 You can do just fine even if you're blind. 

301
00:27:06,734 --> 00:27:09,024
 I'll help you. 

302
00:27:13,544 --> 00:27:20,624
