1
00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:02,654
     

2
00:00:06,624 --> 00:00:12,594


3
00:00:16,834 --> 00:00:20,374
Yeon Seo, are you awake? Come eat breakfast.

4
00:00:46,744 --> 00:00:48,964
  I'll be back after practice.  

5
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:04,164
Congratulations, Yeon Seo!

6
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:06,114
Oh, that's right, congratulations.

7
00:01:06,114 --> 00:01:08,814
It was an excellent Giselle.

8
00:01:11,664 --> 00:01:13,454
Thank you.

9
00:01:15,424 --> 00:01:18,384
Are you looking after the health of our corps?

10
00:01:18,384 --> 00:01:20,344
Include physical therapy and massage in their schedule.

11
00:01:20,344 --> 00:01:21,464
I'm still in charge of—

12
00:01:21,464 --> 00:01:25,224
Then, tell me everything you want. I'll make it happen.

13
00:01:26,804 --> 00:01:28,894
I'll put myself in your hands.

14
00:01:31,054 --> 00:01:33,064
Me, too, Associate Director Geum.

15
00:01:33,064 --> 00:01:35,814
Oh my! You got hurt?

16
00:01:37,434 --> 00:01:39,844
I heard you took sick leave yesterday and skipped practice.

17
00:01:39,844 --> 00:01:43,384
Did something happen on audition day?

18
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:48,474
No, nothing happened. I'll head inside.

19
00:01:48,474 --> 00:01:50,624
Be there on time.

20
00:01:54,834 --> 00:01:56,914
Was Director Ji lying?

21
00:01:56,914 --> 00:02:01,634
She looks so indifferent after supposedly being abducted.

22
00:02:01,634 --> 00:02:04,484
He probably got something wrong. Don't let it get to you.

23
00:02:04,484 --> 00:02:06,464
We can't just ignore this

24
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:09,974
but Ni Na is too weak-hearted.

25
00:02:18,504 --> 00:02:20,984
Where are you?  Why haven't I heard from you in two days? 

26
00:02:20,984 --> 00:02:22,604
You told me to lie low.

27
00:02:22,604 --> 00:02:24,884
What are you talking about? When did I say that?

28
00:02:24,884 --> 00:02:25,754
On that night, I—

29
00:02:25,754 --> 00:02:28,584
 Are you ill?  Are you seeing things?

30
00:02:28,584 --> 00:02:29,854
Yeon Seo is fine.

31
00:02:29,854 --> 00:02:33,614
She fell from a 10-story building, but she walked in with all of her limbs.

32
00:02:33,614 --> 00:02:36,044
 You said you'd take care of this. What did you do? 

33
00:02:36,044 --> 00:02:37,594
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:37,594 --> 00:02:39,634
 Tell me clearly. 

35
00:02:39,634 --> 00:02:43,254
Did she see your face?

36
00:02:46,694 --> 00:02:48,644
Okay, hang up.

37
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:05,204
This can't be possible.

38
00:03:05,204 --> 00:03:09,964
 Yeon Seo is fine. She fell from a 10-story building, but she walked in with all of her limbs. 

39
00:03:09,964 --> 00:03:12,274
 You said you'd take care of this. What did you do? 

40
00:03:12,274 --> 00:03:15,694
No... No!

41
00:03:15,694 --> 00:03:18,504
No! No...

42
00:03:19,434 --> 00:03:20,504
No.

43
00:03:20,504 --> 00:03:22,254
Hello.

44
00:03:37,474 --> 00:03:39,154
You there.

45
00:04:06,034 --> 00:04:08,254
You dropped your cigarettes.

46
00:04:10,654 --> 00:04:13,794
The ballet theatre is a smoke-free building.

47
00:04:15,564 --> 00:04:17,854
Ah, yes. I'm sorry.

48
00:04:23,294 --> 00:04:26,334
I'm your fan. Keep up the good work.

49
00:04:32,484 --> 00:04:36,264
What was that? It's strange.

50
00:04:36,264 --> 00:04:37,784
 Yeon Seo! 

51
00:04:40,004 --> 00:04:41,634
Why are you running again?

52
00:04:41,634 --> 00:04:43,514
Why don't you listen?

53
00:04:43,514 --> 00:04:45,584
I thought my heart dropped!

54
00:04:45,584 --> 00:04:48,594
I just left for work, why would your heart drop?

55
00:04:48,594 --> 00:04:52,794
I begged you. I pleaded with you. I told you to take a few days off. Why did you...

56
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:56,604
I said if you're going, I'll go with you. Why did you go alone?

57
00:04:56,604 --> 00:04:58,164
Because you're like this.

58
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:00,684
I knew you wouldn't let me go, so how could I tell you?

59
00:05:00,684 --> 00:05:03,674
I was going to call you, but I didn't have a phone, so...

60
00:05:03,674 --> 00:05:06,834
Oh, did you find my phone?

61
00:05:09,694 --> 00:05:11,434
I found it, but...

62
00:05:12,874 --> 00:05:16,304
It's broken. You should get a new one.

63
00:05:16,304 --> 00:05:21,884
So, you threw it out? Of your own accord?

64
00:05:21,884 --> 00:05:23,474
No, it's not that—

65
00:05:23,474 --> 00:05:25,494
How funny.

66
00:05:25,494 --> 00:05:28,234
If you're going to do things as you want, you can't tell me what to do.

67
00:05:28,234 --> 00:05:30,334
Even though we...

68
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,904
are in that kind of relationship,

69
00:05:32,904 --> 00:05:35,394
I don't belong to you. You don't need to do that.

70
00:05:35,394 --> 00:05:36,734
I know, I know, but...

71
00:05:36,734 --> 00:05:38,754
You're really strange.

72
00:05:38,754 --> 00:05:44,264
You've been treating me like a three-year-old kid trying to walk on a tightrope

73
00:05:44,264 --> 00:05:46,424
and have been angry with me.

74
00:05:48,064 --> 00:05:50,734
Let's go back.

75
00:05:50,734 --> 00:05:55,024
Hey, Kim Dan! Why are you being like this?

76
00:05:55,024 --> 00:05:57,584
What did I do wrong?

77
00:06:02,714 --> 00:06:04,714
You didn't do anything wrong.

78
00:06:04,714 --> 00:06:08,154
And I'm not mad at you. I'm mad at myself.

79
00:06:11,634 --> 00:06:14,034
When you're done, come to this place. I'll wait.

80
00:06:14,034 --> 00:06:18,794
Don't go alone. Let's meet at this spot, please.

81
00:06:28,834 --> 00:06:31,404
Seriously, what's going on?

82
00:06:38,434 --> 00:06:43,404
It was you people, wasn't it? What did you do to Yeon Seo?

83
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:47,054
Yeon Seo thinks she just fainted that day.

84
00:06:47,554 --> 00:06:48,904
Did you mess around with her memory?

85
00:06:48,904 --> 00:06:51,284
It already happened and it was horrendous.

86
00:06:51,334 --> 00:06:55,834
So... you should be careful, too.

87
00:06:56,434 --> 00:06:59,634
This is why I hate it. Something awful always happens

88
00:06:59,634 --> 00:07:02,254
when you get involved with an angel.

89
00:07:04,694 --> 00:07:05,514
Watch your mouth.

90
00:07:05,514 --> 00:07:07,994
You should have left when I told you to get lost.

91
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:11,244
Your senior or your god is messing with things, trying to fix everything

92
00:07:11,244 --> 00:07:13,404
because you've been lurking around her.

93
00:07:13,404 --> 00:07:17,354
Why do you despise angels so much? What happened to you?

94
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:24,724
Fantasia is like a lion's den to Yeon Seo,

95
00:07:24,724 --> 00:07:29,784
so please look after her when I'm not around.

96
00:07:29,784 --> 00:07:33,264
Who do you think you are to ask me that? I'll take care of it myself.

97
00:08:02,794 --> 00:08:04,824
I won't wear it!

98
00:08:07,054 --> 00:08:08,664
I won't play Myrtha.

99
00:08:08,664 --> 00:08:11,404
No, I can't!

100
00:08:13,024 --> 00:08:17,494
Soo Ji is Bathilde. Jeong Eun is Mom. Woo Jin is Hilarion. Yi Geon is Albrecht.

101
00:08:17,494 --> 00:08:20,474
Ni Na is Myrtha. Didn't you see the announcement?

102
00:08:20,474 --> 00:08:23,294
I don't want to play another role.

103
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:24,224
What do you mean?

104
00:08:24,224 --> 00:08:25,694
I want to do Gieselle's dance,

105
00:08:25,694 --> 00:08:30,854
so I will not take any other role. I will practice the same dance

106
00:08:30,854 --> 00:08:33,634
that Yeon Seo dances, as her understudy.

107
00:08:37,874 --> 00:08:39,774
Myrtha will perform on stage.

108
00:08:39,774 --> 00:08:44,654
But if you chose to be Giselle's understudy, you may end up not performing. Are you okay with that?

109
00:08:44,654 --> 00:08:48,994
Yes. There can be only Giselle for the 2019 performance

110
00:08:48,994 --> 00:08:51,224
for Fantasia.

111
00:09:01,804 --> 00:09:03,234
Ni Na!

112
00:09:06,034 --> 00:09:08,034
What are you thinking?

113
00:09:11,744 --> 00:09:13,584
It's exactly as I said.

114
00:09:13,584 --> 00:09:16,774
During the audition, I truly felt

115
00:09:16,774 --> 00:09:19,214
like I was Giselle.

116
00:09:19,214 --> 00:09:22,984
I've never felt that way before. It was as if I came out of my shell.

117
00:09:22,984 --> 00:09:25,764
Yet, you still won't choose me,

118
00:09:25,764 --> 00:09:29,094
even though I was the Giselle you dreamed of.

119
00:09:29,094 --> 00:09:31,174
I'm still not good enough.

120
00:09:33,724 --> 00:09:34,824
I'm going to accept it.

121
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,314
Even if you're not Giselle,

122
00:09:37,314 --> 00:09:41,784
there are many people who are waiting to see your dance. You should be Myrtha.

123
00:09:41,784 --> 00:09:46,164
 Don't be fooled. I bet he'll offer you another role, 

124
00:09:46,164 --> 00:09:48,684
 but you shouldn't accept it. 

125
00:09:48,684 --> 00:09:51,214
 If I don't, I won't be able to dance on stage. 

126
00:09:51,214 --> 00:09:54,414
 You can never know beforehand who will not be able to appear. 

127
00:09:54,414 --> 00:09:58,964
 Insist on performing as Giselle no matter what. Got it? 

128
00:09:59,534 --> 00:10:05,224
No. I want to appear on the stage as Giselle.

129
00:10:38,184 --> 00:10:40,634
If you see someone, you should greet them first.

130
00:10:40,634 --> 00:10:42,864
Only when they deserve it.

131
00:10:43,524 --> 00:10:48,034
Only when you start acting humanely will I show respect.

132
00:10:48,034 --> 00:10:50,154
What are you saying?

133
00:10:50,804 --> 00:10:54,664
You're saying I'm not even human?

134
00:11:02,714 --> 00:11:06,034
Hey! Where are you going?

135
00:11:13,634 --> 00:11:18,004
Roo Na, what are you trying to do?

136
00:11:22,834 --> 00:11:26,194
It's that person! I need to catch that person.

137
00:11:59,654 --> 00:12:01,694
Seriously, why are you doing this?

138
00:12:01,694 --> 00:12:04,274
It's you, isn't it? Don't you know Lee Yeon Seo?

139
00:12:04,274 --> 00:12:08,174
What are you talking about? Lee Yeon Seo is a ballerina here.

140
00:12:08,174 --> 00:12:12,564
Don't feign ignorance. Both on that ship and during the audition, you were targeting Yeon Seo.

141
00:12:12,564 --> 00:12:14,654
Who are you? Who gave you the order?

142
00:12:14,654 --> 00:12:16,954
Seriously, what's wrong with you?

143
00:12:16,954 --> 00:12:20,104
Gosh. What's going on?

144
00:12:20,104 --> 00:12:21,814
Joon Soo, is that you?

145
00:12:21,814 --> 00:12:23,534
Team Leader.

146
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,234
Get off me.

147
00:12:27,524 --> 00:12:29,864
What's going on? Huh?

148
00:12:32,984 --> 00:12:35,064
My goodness.

149
00:12:35,064 --> 00:12:39,124
So you're saying, he attacked you because he thought you were a bad guy?

150
00:12:39,124 --> 00:12:41,934
He started following me suddenly,

151
00:12:41,934 --> 00:12:44,764
so I got scared. That's why I ran.

152
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:48,814
Where were you from 4:00 to 11:00 p.m. on the day of the audition?

153
00:12:48,814 --> 00:12:52,024
He was working with me.

154
00:12:52,024 --> 00:12:55,354
He wanted to switch shifts with us.

155
00:12:55,354 --> 00:12:59,774
Joon Soo is an angel.

156
00:13:01,024 --> 00:13:02,634
He definitely is.

157
00:13:02,634 --> 00:13:04,594
Are you happy now?

158
00:13:07,564 --> 00:13:09,714
I'm sorry.

159
00:13:09,714 --> 00:13:12,224
It's okay. I understand.

160
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:15,544
I do hope you catch him though.

161
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:19,424
I'm sorry.

162
00:14:17,944 --> 00:14:20,084
Are you crazy? Why are you here?

163
00:14:20,084 --> 00:14:22,424
Yeon Seo is practicing now.

164
00:14:22,424 --> 00:14:24,654
I know. That's why I'm here.

165
00:14:24,654 --> 00:14:28,684
In order to find out whether she's pretending not to remember or not,

166
00:14:28,684 --> 00:14:30,524
I'll have to show myself to her.

167
00:14:30,524 --> 00:14:31,724
What if you get caught?

168
00:14:31,724 --> 00:14:34,444
Then, I'll tell them that I did everything single-handedly.

169
00:14:34,444 --> 00:14:39,434
Joon Soo, I won't let you end up behind the bars ever again.

170
00:14:42,654 --> 00:14:47,244
Anyway, since we are certain now that Yeon Seo doesn't recognize you,

171
00:14:47,244 --> 00:14:50,304
don't act rashly. Act normally.

172
00:14:50,304 --> 00:14:51,794
Okay.

173
00:15:08,804 --> 00:15:11,184
Hello. I'm on my way.

174
00:15:11,184 --> 00:15:14,364
It'll take 30 minutes. I'm only going to look for props.

175
00:15:14,364 --> 00:15:16,484
Okay, I'll see you later.

176
00:15:37,554 --> 00:15:39,644
What are you doing?

177
00:15:41,864 --> 00:15:44,094
Since when?

178
00:15:44,094 --> 00:15:47,304
Since when were to planning to harm Yeon Seo?

179
00:15:47,304 --> 00:15:49,354
What are you talking about?

180
00:15:49,354 --> 00:15:52,494
Yeon Seo is dancing in the practice room right now.

181
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:55,824
So you'll act innocent?

182
00:15:55,824 --> 00:15:58,864
What's gotten into you? Are you deluded like she is?

183
00:15:58,864 --> 00:16:00,644
You're the one who's deluded.

184
00:16:00,644 --> 00:16:04,004
You believe you can deceive everyone. You believe that

185
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:09,064
you'll be happy getting what you want, even if it's through evil means.

186
00:16:09,064 --> 00:16:10,924
Now, I've finally realized

187
00:16:10,924 --> 00:16:16,944
that you have a wicked soul within that beautiful shell of yours. So...

188
00:16:23,664 --> 00:16:30,624
You'll never be able to harm her again. Not on my watch.

189
00:16:45,954 --> 00:16:47,274
 I'll see you tomorrow! 

190
00:16:47,274 --> 00:16:48,994
 Bye! 

191
00:17:01,114 --> 00:17:05,504
He told me not to be alone. Where is he?

192
00:17:08,604 --> 00:17:11,014
Kim Dan.

193
00:17:11,014 --> 00:17:13,654
Come out, Dan.

194
00:17:13,654 --> 00:17:15,484
Come out.

195
00:17:18,494 --> 00:17:23,314

196

♫  Today, again you live inside me  ♫

197
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:31,724
What's with his face?

198
00:17:31,724 --> 00:17:34,004
Is he still upset?

199
00:17:37,024 --> 00:17:42,974
♫  I felt that it was love  ♫

200
00:17:42,974 --> 00:17:44,754
Stop. People might see us.

I'm going to protect you.

202
00:17:46,924 --> 00:17:50,384
You'll never be alone ever again.

203
00:17:50,384 --> 00:17:55,914

210
00:18:34,504 --> 00:18:39,764

 Angel Kim Dan will be back to work from his vacation. 

230
00:20:03,644 --> 00:20:06,504
 I wanted to tell her I was an angel, 

231
00:20:06,504 --> 00:20:09,714
 and she almost found out I was an angel. 

232
00:20:09,714 --> 00:20:14,414
 However, everything stemmed from my greed. 

233
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:19,284
 Perhaps, I might fail my mission. 

234
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:21,824
♫  Because of you  ♫

235
00:20:21,824 --> 00:20:24,214
 I might turn into dust. 

236
00:20:26,804 --> 00:20:31,374
 However, before that happens,  

237
00:20:31,374 --> 00:20:37,284
 please allow me to keep my promise that I'll protect her. 

238
00:20:37,284 --> 00:20:43,614
♫  I will always love you, to you  ♫

239
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:52,364
So, when you followed a suspicious man, you saw him meeting with Associate Director Geum?

240
00:20:52,364 --> 00:20:55,164
I'm not certain that he kidnapped Yeon Seo two days ago,

241
00:20:55,164 --> 00:20:58,864
but my suspicion of him won't go away, so I decided to tell you.

242
00:20:58,864 --> 00:21:01,504
But, why would Roo Na do that?

243
00:21:01,504 --> 00:21:04,124
Not General Director Choi or Ni Na.

244
00:21:05,204 --> 00:21:10,094
Evil behavior... doesn't need a good reason.

245
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:13,604
Ji Woong has to confirm this.

246
00:21:14,324 --> 00:21:18,464
I'm so stupid. I should've gotten the files the other day.

247
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:21,954
- Who? 
- A guy who vanished into thin air.

248
00:21:26,844 --> 00:21:28,804
Yes?

249
00:21:28,804 --> 00:21:30,964
This is Jeong Yoo Mi.

250
00:21:33,324 --> 00:21:34,924
What?

251
00:21:36,344 --> 00:21:38,254
I'll be right there.

252
00:21:40,104 --> 00:21:41,534
What is this about?

253
00:21:41,534 --> 00:21:43,494
Please look after her.

254
00:21:47,704 --> 00:21:49,244
 Thank you for identifying his body. 

255
00:21:49,244 --> 00:21:52,184
 We didn't find any belongings and thought this would take a while, 

256
00:21:52,184 --> 00:21:55,934
 but luckily, we found your business card in his pocket. 

257
00:21:55,934 --> 00:21:59,254
 The autopsy result shows that he had terminal cancer. 

258
00:21:59,254 --> 00:22:02,194
 We'll close the case as a suicide due to an unhappy life. 

259
00:22:20,294 --> 00:22:21,754
I'm here. What is it?

260
00:22:21,754 --> 00:22:24,334
Are you sick? Do you need anything?

261
00:22:25,854 --> 00:22:28,774
Can you clean my practice room for me?

262
00:22:28,774 --> 00:22:33,584
I'm going to practice all day today at home, but I hate when it's dirty.

263
00:22:33,584 --> 00:22:35,004
I'm sure your housekeeper probably did it.

264
00:22:35,004 --> 00:22:38,744
Can you do it? That will help me feel at ease.

265
00:22:38,744 --> 00:22:40,654
You'll do it, right?

266
00:22:42,784 --> 00:22:44,334
Yes.

267
00:23:18,324 --> 00:23:21,744
If you're not telling me what it is, you must have a reason for it.

268
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:26,854
Then, I'm going to find out why.

269
00:23:53,154 --> 00:23:55,554
He didn't throw it out.

270
00:23:56,264 --> 00:23:59,004
Is it completely broken?

271
00:24:04,584 --> 00:24:06,624
   

272
00:24:20,964 --> 00:24:22,744
It's all done.

273
00:24:25,324 --> 00:24:28,194
Do you need gloves? Do you want to check?

274
00:24:34,964 --> 00:24:36,624
What's wrong?

275
00:24:36,624 --> 00:24:43,154
You don't really love me?

276
00:24:44,424 --> 00:24:46,224
What's gotten into you all of a sudden?

277
00:24:46,224 --> 00:24:50,964
I... trusted you to the end,

278
00:24:50,964 --> 00:24:53,144
and I wanted to trust you.

279
00:24:55,634 --> 00:24:58,744
Can you explain? That way, I can at least give you an explanation.

280
00:24:58,744 --> 00:25:03,714
Forget it. Why would I explain it to you when you won't do the same for me?

281
00:25:05,414 --> 00:25:07,564
Don't even talk to me.

282
00:25:08,514 --> 00:25:10,794
Lee Yeon Seo!

283
00:25:10,794 --> 00:25:13,234
   

284
00:25:13,234 --> 00:25:14,464
I'm busy. We can talk later.

285
00:25:14,464 --> 00:25:16,484
 I'm in front of the house. 

286
00:25:22,914 --> 00:25:26,564
Why are you here? I told you to tell Yeon Seo I was here.

287
00:25:26,564 --> 00:25:28,754
I need to talk to you.

288
00:25:30,884 --> 00:25:35,974
I think Associate Director Geum is after Yeon Seo.

289
00:25:35,974 --> 00:25:37,714
I already knew it.

290
00:25:37,714 --> 00:25:38,764
What?

291
00:25:38,764 --> 00:25:41,644
I mean, I suspected it was her.

292
00:25:41,644 --> 00:25:44,764
But why didn't you tell me?

293
00:25:44,764 --> 00:25:47,014
What can you do?

294
00:25:47,014 --> 00:25:50,664
How much time do you have left? Two weeks? A month?

295
00:25:50,664 --> 00:25:53,264
You'll only stay here for a few days and go back to your realm.

296
00:25:53,264 --> 00:25:55,944
On top of that, you're an angel.

297
00:25:55,944 --> 00:25:59,564
If necessary, I can even kill those people

298
00:25:59,564 --> 00:26:01,954
for Yeon Seo.

299
00:26:02,674 --> 00:26:06,744
You cannot... repay evil with evil.

300
00:26:06,744 --> 00:26:08,414
That only applies to angels like you.

301
00:26:08,414 --> 00:26:12,974
A human like me isn't afraid of His judgment anymore.

302
00:26:12,974 --> 00:26:16,644
You're not... afraid of Him anymore?

303
00:26:16,644 --> 00:26:18,054
 There was 

304
00:26:18,054 --> 00:26:21,404
 a greenhorn angel who thought he was special, 

305
00:26:21,404 --> 00:26:23,774
 just like you. 

306
00:26:23,774 --> 00:26:26,414
I knew it. You were him.

307
00:26:27,934 --> 00:26:29,184
The greenhorn angel.

308
00:26:29,184 --> 00:26:31,174
What matters now is the present

309
00:26:31,174 --> 00:26:35,914
and the man who will stay by Yeon Seo's side to the end.

310
00:26:35,914 --> 00:26:38,624
When did you turn into a human?

311
00:26:38,624 --> 00:26:42,104
No. How did you become a human?

312
00:26:42,104 --> 00:26:48,934
No. Can an angel become a human being?

313
00:26:51,574 --> 00:26:53,434
Answer me now.

314
00:26:53,434 --> 00:26:55,974
What are you talking about...

315
00:26:57,854 --> 00:27:00,064
without me?

316
00:27:01,424 --> 00:27:05,564
I asked him to call you. I can only contact you through your secretary.

317
00:27:08,364 --> 00:27:11,484
I told him to go back. You don't have to talk about anything with him.

318
00:27:11,484 --> 00:27:16,104
Let's go. I need to talk to Director Ji.

319
00:27:17,164 --> 00:27:18,224
Let's go together.

320
00:27:18,224 --> 00:27:19,674
Stay at home.

321
00:27:19,674 --> 00:27:21,854
Why?

322
00:27:27,324 --> 00:27:30,034
I have a secret just like you.

323
00:27:55,954 --> 00:28:00,774
I never sent that text message, but you received that message from me.

324
00:28:00,774 --> 00:28:04,044


325
00:28:04,044 --> 00:28:06,824
I thought you probably didn't mean it.

326
00:28:06,824 --> 00:28:09,994
Don't lie.

327
00:28:09,994 --> 00:28:11,734
In hindsight, everything is odd.

328
00:28:11,734 --> 00:28:17,644
I'm not the type to easily faint because I started to practice again.

329
00:28:17,644 --> 00:28:20,564
I hate that you and Dan whisper to each other without me.

330
00:28:20,564 --> 00:28:23,054
Tell me everything you know.

331
00:28:23,054 --> 00:28:28,504
Do you remember my friend I placed at the temple?

332
00:28:28,504 --> 00:28:31,904
She died... right in front of me.

333
00:28:31,904 --> 00:28:33,744
♫   Friday nights, they always seemed so bright   ♫  

334
00:28:33,744 --> 00:28:35,374
And...

335
00:28:35,374 --> 00:28:37,974
♫   But now I lose my way  ♫ 

336
00:28:37,974 --> 00:28:41,464
♫   You see the pain gets deeper every step I take ♫ 

337
00:28:41,464 --> 00:28:44,534
...this is the photo I took with her.

338
00:28:44,534 --> 00:28:48,514
♫   Hugs and kisses, dancing on his arm   ♫  

339
00:28:51,904 --> 00:28:56,164
You two look alike. The resemblance is uncanny.

340
00:28:58,214 --> 00:29:03,414
Is this why... you insisted on working with me?

341
00:29:04,424 --> 00:29:07,974
Director Ji, I'm not her.

342
00:29:07,974 --> 00:29:09,004
I know.

343
00:29:09,004 --> 00:29:14,074
At first... I thought you were her replacement.

344
00:29:14,074 --> 00:29:15,804
But not anymore.

345
00:29:15,804 --> 00:29:22,574
I love Lee Yeon Seo's dance. And I love you as a person, Yeon Seo.

346
00:29:23,314 --> 00:29:26,774
You asked me to tell you what happened that night,

347
00:29:26,774 --> 00:29:27,934
but I can't tell you.

348
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:33,494
I will take care of it without you knowing, and I don't want you to remember a tormenting memory.

349
00:29:33,494 --> 00:29:36,804
A tormenting memory?

350
00:29:36,804 --> 00:29:43,804
And above all, I don't want to lose you again like that time.

351
00:29:50,474 --> 00:29:54,964
An angel became human.

352
00:29:55,954 --> 00:30:00,274
An angel fell in love

353
00:30:00,274 --> 00:30:02,684
and became human.

354
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:07,464
 The moment she knows that you're an angel, Noisy Gong and you 

355
00:30:07,464 --> 00:30:09,494
 won't be able to stay together. 

356
00:30:11,004 --> 00:30:14,954
If I become human...

357
00:30:26,644 --> 00:30:29,734
   

358
00:30:39,664 --> 00:30:41,584
H-Hello?

359
00:30:41,584 --> 00:30:43,714
 It's me, Noisy Gong. 

360
00:30:43,714 --> 00:30:45,734
Where are you? How did you find your phone?

361
00:30:45,734 --> 00:30:48,584
I'm at the park where I fainted.

362
00:30:48,584 --> 00:30:50,044
Alone? Where is Ji Kang Woo?

363
00:30:50,044 --> 00:30:55,354
No one will tell me what happened, so I just came here  thinking I might remember something. 

364
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:57,454
I'll come over there. Stay right there.

365
00:30:57,454 --> 00:31:00,074
Let me ask you one last time.

366
00:31:01,194 --> 00:31:06,284
Do you really have nothing to say to me?

367
00:31:09,244 --> 00:31:10,964
I'll tell you when I get there.

368
00:31:10,964 --> 00:31:14,744
No. Let's keep talking on the phone until I get there.

369
00:31:14,744 --> 00:31:17,004
 It's too late. 

370
00:31:17,004 --> 00:31:19,534
I said it was the last time.

371
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:23,634
Yeon Seo? Yeon Seo!

372
00:31:28,514 --> 00:31:32,544
♫  I wanna be your light  ♫

373

00:31:40,364 --> 00:31:42,274

♫  I stretch out my hand for you  ♫

377
00:31:53,604 --> 00:31:55,354
♫  Why is this so hard  ♫

378
00:31:55,354 --> 00:31:57,434
May I ask you something?

379
00:31:57,434 --> 00:31:59,134
Sure. Do you need anything?

380
00:31:59,134 --> 00:32:05,454
Do you remember the guy who bought a red balloon here a couple of days back?

381
00:32:05,454 --> 00:32:07,254
♫  I want this heart  ♫

382
00:32:07,254 --> 00:32:08,484

♫  to reach you  ♫

384
00:32:10,414 --> 00:32:11,594
Oh, this man.

385
00:32:11,594 --> 00:32:14,164
He bought an umbrella and a balloon.

386
00:32:14,164 --> 00:32:16,794
Yes, that's him. What happened after that?

387
00:32:16,794 --> 00:32:18,904
He ran everywhere around screaming

388
00:32:18,904 --> 00:32:22,884
that his girlfriend suddenly went missing.

389
00:32:22,884 --> 00:32:24,974
I wonder if he found her.

390
00:32:24,974 --> 00:32:31,874
He said... she went missing.

391
00:32:34,424 --> 00:32:37,344

Yeon Seo, are you okay?

397
00:33:01,734 --> 00:33:06,614
Don't go around alone. If anything, be with Ji Kang Woo. Do you know how worried I was?

398
00:33:09,934 --> 00:33:12,284
Are you...

399
00:33:12,284 --> 00:33:16,554
I'll tell you everything. I didn't want to surprise you—

400
00:33:17,694 --> 00:33:19,804
Kim Dan,

401
00:33:22,324 --> 00:33:27,864

♫  The lives we play behind  ♫

403

♫  A constant brink   ♫

405
00:33:38,324 --> 00:33:40,974
You can't lie.

♫  Our minds belong  ♫

407
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:47,194
 You don't really love me? 

408
00:33:47,194 --> 00:33:49,684
 The moment she knows that you're an angel, Noisy Gong and you 

409
00:33:49,684 --> 00:33:51,144
 won't be able to stay together. 

410
00:33:51,144 --> 00:33:53,824
 I... 

411
00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:59,964
 trusted you to the end. And I wanted to trust you.

416
00:34:08,064 --> 00:34:08,924

 Do you want me to stay with you tonight? 

424
00:34:51,204 --> 00:34:52,754
 Pseudo-religious con artists. 

425
00:34:52,754 --> 00:34:53,974
 That was humiliating. 

426
00:34:53,974 --> 00:34:55,384
 I came to tell you to stop fooling me. 

427
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:56,124
 Got it?! 

428
00:34:56,124 --> 00:34:57,194
 - Yes, we got it. 
- Yes. 

429
00:34:57,194 --> 00:35:01,404
 I mean, shouldn't she thank me first? 

430
00:35:01,404 --> 00:35:04,424
 I'll make sure those who hurt you get punished. 

431
00:35:04,424 --> 00:35:05,374
 I promise. 

432
00:35:05,374 --> 00:35:08,104
 What do I need to do to become a human? 

433
00:35:08,104 --> 00:35:13,064
 God is very jealous. Kim Dan will dissipate 

434
00:35:13,064 --> 00:35:15,144
 because of your love.
