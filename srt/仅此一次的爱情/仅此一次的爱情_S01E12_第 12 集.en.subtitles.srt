1
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:56,556
Yeon-seo!

2
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,558
I clearly remember

3
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,352
waving my hands at him

4
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,271
from here.

5
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:05,857
He ran around everywhere screaming

6
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,652
that his girlfriend suddenly went missing.

7
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,404
I wonder if he found her.

8
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,867
Wait, was it you?

9
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:18,328
It wasn't me.

10
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:22,707
I just collapsed here
for a second, then...

11
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:24,834
Are you awake?

12
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,711
How do you feel?

13
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,215
Yeon-seo. Listen carefully.
Yesterday, you...

14
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,384
No, that's not what happened.

15
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,931
She must be mistaken. That wasn't me.

16
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,349
It wasn't Dan either.

17
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,184
Then...

18
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:03,873
Wait, what's going on?

19
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:11,798
I'm not letting you live.

20
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,307
No one kills themselves

21
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,686
with their eyes covered and hands tied up.

22
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,608
What is this?

23
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,735
Goodness, what is this?

24
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,032
Are you okay?

25
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,243
Look at me, Yeon-seo.

26
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,537
It's me.

27
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,472
She regained her memory.

28
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:08,062
I know it was useless to make her forget.

29
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,064
But why did I still do it?

30
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,442
Because I was afraid

31
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,652
of what was to come.

32
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:20,450
Dan.

33
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:21,951
Are you...

34
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:25,747
an angel?

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,084
Answer me.

36
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,380
You can't lie.

37
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:44,974
Yes.

38
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,145
I'm an angel.

39
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:57,904
I'm sorry.

40
00:03:58,738 --> 00:03:59,614
I was wrong.

41
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,785
It's all my fault.

42
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,706
But hear me out.

43
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,707
No.

44
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,584
I don't need to hear it.

45
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,428
-I'm sorry.
-It was your last chance.

46
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,222
I told you that I wanted to trust you

47
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:26,641
to the end.

48
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:27,976
That day,

49
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,228
I was going to tell you right here.

50
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,774
That I'm not human.

51
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,110
That I am an angel with wings.

52
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,570
I was afraid that you'd be disgusted

53
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,532
and afraid of me.

54
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,951
Despite all that, I was going
to tell you the truth. But--

55
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:46,536
But you couldn't because I was kidnapped?

56
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,955
How was I to tell you that
you had almost died

57
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:50,540
and that something horrible had happened?

58
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:51,582
You're making an excuse.

59
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,126
No, I'm trying to explain myself.

60
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,669
You had many chances to do that.

61
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,046
The day we first met,
when you started working for me,

62
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,673
when the chandelier fell on me,

63
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,551
and when I held onto you and asked
why you couldn't like me.

64
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,137
You should've come clean then.

65
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,017
If I did,

66
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,354
would you have believed me?

67
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,733
Did you think I would have been shocked?

68
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:21,112
What's so great about being an angel?

69
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,699
Whether you were a vampire,
a goblin, an alien, or whatnot,

70
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,243
you should've told me.

71
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,747
You're the one who doesn't trust me.

72
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:32,790
And that fact...

73
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,171
The fact that
you don't trust me is infuriating.

74
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,735
-Yeon-seo.
-Don't touch me.

75
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,446
Are you okay?

76
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,531
-It's only a scratch.
-Let me see.

77
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,548
What was that?

78
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,425
Are you really...

79
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:26,803
Are you really...

80
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:31,599
You said you wouldn't be shocked.

81
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,769
How could I not be
when a scar just disappeared?

82
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:37,313
I get it.

83
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,482
You're human.

84
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:44,320
Just try to accept it
even if it's odd and disgusting.

85
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,240
Even though you push me away,

86
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,784
I'm going to stay by your side.

87
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,622
Are you not giving me a choice?
Don't you have a sense of shame?

88
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,374
You're still in danger.

89
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,127
Someone

90
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,754
might harm you again.

91
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,883
Thinking that you may still
be in danger drives me insane!

92
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,176
So

93
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:09,387
just accept it.

94
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,640
Don't act like you're doing me a favor.

95
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:15,852
It's an angel's duty
to save someone in danger.

96
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:17,353
Just leave.

97
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,313
I won't.

98
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,482
If you keep doing this,

99
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,359
I'll pretend like you're invisible.

100
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,194
You're not even human, to begin with.

101
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,572
Fine! Just think of me
as an annoying ghost.

102
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,324
I'm seriously going to ignore you.

103
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,868
-Fine!
-Fine!

104
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:01,606
I get that it could be
appalling or disgusting.

105
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:05,526
But still, as a human,
shouldn't she thank me first?

106
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,862
I saved her
from falling off a tall building.

107
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:13,868
He is really

108
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:16,412
an angel.

109
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,499
He really is.

110
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,054
I witnessed it with my own eyes.

111
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:36,766
Yet, I still can't believe it.

112
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:38,559
It's me.

113
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,062
-Don't you dare come in.
-I'm coming in.

114
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,355
Hey!

115
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,857
Are you not going to listen to me?

116
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,526
Just think of me as a ghost.

117
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,778
How could I think an angel is a ghost?

118
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,453
Do you want me to

119
00:08:58,454 --> 00:08:59,497
stay with you tonight?

120
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,459
What? Are you insane?

121
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,503
Leave. Leave right now.

122
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:08,005
Will you be all right being alone?
You said you remembered everything.

123
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:12,134
That means you remember
what happened on that rooftop.

124
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:21,936
Don't worry.

125
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,898
I won't ever let you go. I'll protect you.

126
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:30,987
Okay?

127
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,489
Is that

128
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:35,658
your mission?

129
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,744
You said you were sent from above.

130
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,539
You said you had to complete your mission.

131
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:45,334
Did the deity really send you here

132
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,379
to save me from danger?

133
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,339
Are you

134
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:52,675
my guardian angel?

135
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,688
Get up.

136
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,106
I knew you'd do this again.

137
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,358
I knew you would beat around the bush.

138
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,361
Where are we going?

139
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:22,955
Sister.

140
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:27,251
I'd like to meet with the provost.

141
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:30,880
I'm sorry,
but he's not here at the moment.

142
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,144
How could you bring her here?

143
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,688
She remembered everything!

144
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,106
My gosh, you little--

145
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,530
Do you even transform
to deceive people now?

146
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,536
This is the same smell from last time.

147
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:04,747
Is this smell

148
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:06,832
from above as well?

149
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,718
Gosh!

150
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:31,023
-It's so hot in here!
-I know, right?

151
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,441
Why is the light shining through?

152
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,318
So you even set up your headquarters

153
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,987
to deceive people?

154
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,407
Look at you. You are being quite...

155
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,450
Is she always rude?

156
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:42,952
Right. I think she is.

157
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,370
He was an orphan?

158
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:46,455
What was it about birds again?

159
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,750
Is this like an orphanage?

160
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,210
He takes care of birds

161
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:55,381
and humans who have no place to go.

162
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:58,050
He said he had a father who threw him out.

163
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,261
You know what we people mean
when we say "father."

164
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,352
I didn't say that
he was an orphan, per se.

165
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,438
You told me not to look for him
because it wasn't fate.

166
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,064
It's just that the time has come.

167
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:13,399
Only when

168
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,110
it is over do they realize

169
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,696
that their time is up and that it's over.

170
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:19,780
Hu!

171
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,615
I wasn't lying.

172
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:22,658
Do you know

173
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,035
how heartbroken and desperate I was?

174
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,913
I felt responsible for making him leave,

175
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,832
so I felt guilty and was worried.

176
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,963
Pseudo-religious con artists.

177
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,507
"Pseudo-religious con artists"?

178
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,135
That is extremely insulting.

179
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,012
I was just like you in the beginning.

180
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,141
I came here to warn you
to never deceive me again.

181
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:50,936
You've always been
beating around the bush.

182
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,022
I won't allow that ever again.

183
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,024
Are we clear?

184
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:56,567
Yes.

185
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,527
-Are we clear on that?
-Yes, we are.

186
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,904
-Yes, we got it.
-Yes.

187
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:00,946
Of course.

188
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:02,698
So

189
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:04,950
what's his mission?

190
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:08,746
I'm sure he must have had a mission
when he was sent to me from up above.

191
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,122
What is it?

192
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,671
-You come back here!
-Wait, wait.

193
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,048
No!

194
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,926
-Set me up with whom?
-You got the wrong idea.

195
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,886
How dare you pick my rib? How dare you?

196
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,555
At first, I just wanted you
to love anyone.

197
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,806
Anyone?

198
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,308
You must have no conscience!

199
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:32,019
Even matchmaking agencies
are more diligent and pickier than that!

200
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,979
I regretted it right away.

201
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,106
I wished that you would love me
instead of someone

202
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:38,776
like him.

203
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,819
That's what I thought.

204
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,572
There you go again!

205
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,449
Don't try to weasel your way
out of this again.

206
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,201
I haven't forgiven you yet.

207
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:50,746
Unbelievable. He just spits out
what comes to his mind.

208
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,540
Wait up for me.

209
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:29,577
What is

210
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,455
your life goal, honey?

211
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:37,710
Well,

212
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,630
it's to see our daughters
getting married to nice men.

213
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,675
And then, I want to move back to
the rural area with you

214
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:47,970
and grow onions and scallions.

215
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:49,889
That's my life goal.

216
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,392
I'll do all the farming.

217
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,561
I won't let you touch the dirt.

218
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,605
But why are you asking me that now?

219
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,109
What if the seeds you sowed

220
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,029
were poisonous plants?

221
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,699
-What?
-What if your cherished plant

222
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,494
grows up to be a poisonous mushroom
and before you could do anything,

223
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:16,165
it causes all the other plants to die?

224
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,293
I should weed it out

225
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,253
before it spreads more.

226
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:57,915
Mom.

227
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:59,917
Hey, you're up.

228
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,212
Did you have a drink?

229
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,224
Who's that man?

230
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,519
What are you talking about?

231
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,396
The man who acts like
he's your right hand.

232
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,273
When did it start?

233
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:25,776
Were you involved

234
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,571
in Mr. Cho's death too?

235
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,240
Pretend you don't know anything.

236
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,827
I'll make your wish and Ni-na's wish

237
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,870
come true.

238
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,163
No.

239
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,458
Ru-na, listen carefully.

240
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:45,671
I was behind everything
that you've done so far.

241
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,675
-Mom.
-Everything that was evil, dirty,

242
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,427
and horrible.

243
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,846
You don't know anything about this.

244
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:57,433
I was the one
who plotted and ordered them.

245
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:58,851
Do you understand me?

246
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,311
There's no need.

247
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,396
And

248
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,690
from now on,

249
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,945
you cannot plot anything
without telling me first.

250
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,450
Promise me.

251
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,121
I promise.

252
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,419
Don't worry.

253
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,713
It's nothing.

254
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,073
KIM DAN

255
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,916
Are you sleeping?

256
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,168
No.

257
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,171
Should I bring you chamomile tea?

258
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,964
No.

259
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,472
Yeon-seo.

260
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,518
-Yes?
-I was so upset and heartbroken

261
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,855
when I decided to send you away to him,

262
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,025
so I thought something was wrong with me.

263
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,323
I won't send you away
to anyone starting now.

264
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,996
I'm sleepy. Let's go to sleep.

265
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,141
Goodnight.

266
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,697
You must listen to this now.

267
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,747
How did you find me?

268
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,125
Money can do anything.

269
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,962
I'm going to stay out of this, but please

270
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,965
just wait a bit. Once the show is over--

271
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,425
I'm telling you to be careful.

272
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,427
That's what I wanted to tell you.

273
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,973
Ms. Lee doesn't know anything.

274
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,100
Since there's no evidence,
there won't be any punishment.

275
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,352
And only Yeon-seo will suffer from this.

276
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,229
So what then?

277
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,608
I plan to give up on everything.

278
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,944
We should call it quits
before Ms. Lee finds out.

279
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,030
Bye.

280
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,592
Why did you do that?

281
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,302
Ji-ung is dead.

282
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,221
No, he was murdered.

283
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,239
I need to buy some time.

284
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,574
We must go to the police right now.
What are you talking about?

285
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,035
You were kidnapped
and almost fell from the building.

286
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,246
There's no evidence.

287
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:50,749
I got permission to check the surveillance
camera, but there wasn't anything.

288
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:52,626
You said all of Mr. Moon's
belongings disappeared.

289
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,920
A testimony won't
be enough to bring charges.

290
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,172
We should have a lead for them

291
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,340
to reinvestigate.

292
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:01,218
Mr. Park has to gather his courage
and make up his mind.

293
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,971
He must be scared. He went off the grid.

294
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,305
What is going on?

295
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:06,598
How do you think they found out

296
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,725
that Ji-ung was in Seoul
and that he met with us?

297
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,936
I got my phone checked by a technician.

298
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,730
Since it wasn't my phone,
that only leaves us your phone.

299
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,774
They were wiretapping your phone.

300
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:18,485
Luckily, they still believe
that Ms. Lee doesn't

301
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,529
remember that she was kidnapped that day.

302
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,572
I'm sure they're wiretapping his phone.

303
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,199
Let's use that to our advantage.

304
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:25,492
Why are you surprised?

305
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,869
Did you think that you would be safe

306
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:29,788
if you worked with both sides?

307
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,833
Comforting and coaxing
a faint-hearted person won't work.

308
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,919
We must make him face the harsh reality.

309
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,630
He should know that
there's no place to hide.

310
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:46,722
I'm sorry, Ms. Lee.

311
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:49,766
All of a sudden?

312
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,601
That was my chance.

313
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:54,604
When Seung-hwan

314
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,525
scolded me that
I would get my hands dirty,

315
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,610
I should have stopped then.

316
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:02,154
Mr. Cho...

317
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:05,866
knew?

318
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,492
Yeon-seo, hold tight.

319
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,039
If you give me just a little more time,

320
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,957
I will bring you back to your place.

321
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:14,916
Is that why

322
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:17,419
you killed him?

323
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:20,630
No, no. I wasn't behind it.
I only did what I was ordered to do.

324
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,007
I didn't know they would hurt him.

325
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:22,966
Shut your mouth!

326
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,802
I won't give you time
to ask for my forgiveness

327
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:26,887
or to give me excuses.

328
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,515
You can live in torment for the rest of
your life without speaking a word of this.

329
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:36,188
If what happened three years ago
wasn't an accident but an incident,

330
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,523
I suspected that
his car accident probably wasn't

331
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:40,609
a mere accident.

332
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,489
But how...

333
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:49,284
Don't you know what kind of person he was?

334
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:51,703
He was good-natured and righteous.

335
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,789
How could you hurt someone like him?

336
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,753
Don't use your weakness to turn wicked.

337
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:04,007
And think hard about the way
you can be forgiven, Mr. Park.

338
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,346
Let's go.

339
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,781
You two can go.

340
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:31,076
I'll try to convince
Mr. Park a little more.

341
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,036
Okay.

342
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,958
Are you okay?

343
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,334
I'm completely fine.

344
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:41,002
You're lying again.

345
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,172
Let's sit down for a bit.

346
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:53,890
Hey, Angel.

347
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:57,686
Does the devil

348
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,355
really exist?

349
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,985
If angels exist,
then it means devils exist too.

350
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,281
I don't think they're the ones
with horns and tails.

351
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:12,826
I'm a brat,

352
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,745
and I could be annoying,
so I understand that.

353
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:17,873
They would want to kill me.

354
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:20,208
But not Mr. Cho.

355
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,505
Why did he have to be sacrificed?

356
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,507
Tell me.

357
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:30,260
If the deity exists, how can He do this?

358
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:33,054
Both humans and angels

359
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,516
could never know what the deity's will is.

360
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,314
That's so petty and cheap.

361
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:48,403
Can you walk?

362
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:52,449
I want you

363
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:54,492
to come with me.

364
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,604
What is this? A fountain?

365
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,272
A rainbow.

366
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,260
Yeon-seo.

367
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:07,691
This is...

368
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:09,025
Open it.

369
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:33,842
LEE YEON-SEO, YOO SEONG-U

370
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:37,595
Why

371
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:41,099
do you have this?

372
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:44,060
I gave this to Seong-u.

373
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:46,938
It's me.

374
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,482
What are you talking about?

375
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:51,776
The kid that you met on Yeonhwa Island...

376
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,029
I'm Yoo Seong-u.

377
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,742
I didn't know that at first.

378
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:02,037
But I kept on having dreams
ever since I met you.

379
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:04,414
I began to remember.

380
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:06,666
Do you remember?

381
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,127
The promise that I made
on the day you showed me

382
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:10,503
your rainbow dance.

383
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:12,589
That you'll become

384
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,466
an adult?

385
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,677
That I'll make sure I become an adult.

386
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:19,888
That after I grow up,

387
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,766
I'll protect you.

388
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:28,855
I think I was sent to you

389
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:31,858
to keep that promise

390
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:34,694
by that bad deity

391
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,030
that you despised.

392
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:42,285
I'll be with you from now on,
so do not worry.

393
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:46,247
I will protect you so that no one will

394
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:47,832
hurt you.

395
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:54,464
Are you angry?

396
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,426
Yeon-seo.

397
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:00,011
Do not follow me.

398
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:06,935
She's really angry.

399
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,612
I know you're angry,
dumbfounded, and shocked.

400
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:21,741
You can hit me as much as you want
until you feel better.

401
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:33,711
Why are you crying?

402
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,507
I had to say goodbye to him again
without realizing

403
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:41,052
that he was with me.

404
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,057
I said goodbye to him,

405
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,103
telling him to not live in pain
on the other side.

406
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:55,442
At my last moment...

407
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,819
When my final moment came,

408
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,156
I thought of you.

409
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:10,707
Don't cry.

410
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:13,585
I don't want to see you cry

411
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,004
because of me.

412
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:52,373
Then

413
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:54,584
did you fail your mission?

414
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,464
I don't know yet.

415
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:03,009
You were told to make me love again,

416
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:04,969
but you fell in love instead.

417
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,846
That means you failed.

418
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,391
Then what will happen to you?

419
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,519
Will you be reprimanded

420
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:14,771
back in paradise?

421
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:18,858
It's not over yet.

422
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:20,401
I'm looking for a way.

423
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:22,445
To do what?

424
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,531
To stay with you.

425
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:29,744
I'll make sure I find it.

426
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,329
Trust me.

427
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:55,103
I have a question.

428
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,564
I was wondering
why you suddenly called me out.

429
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:00,275
What do I need to do to become a human?

430
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:02,944
Let me ask you again.

431
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,153
How did you

432
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,240
become a human?

433
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:11,953
Do you think

434
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:13,913
I'll tell you that?

435
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,206
I gave this a thought.

436
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,292
Why did you do this?

437
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,169
You knew what you did was meaningless.

438
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:23,131
Projecting a dead person's image
onto Yeon-seo.

439
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:26,885
You knew you weren't supposed to do that.

440
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:27,802
Shut up.

441
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,346
She isn't someone
you can dare to speak of.

442
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,228
You were in pain.

443
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,983
The pain of not being able
to see the one you love.

444
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,655
That's why you were obsessive
and determined.

445
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:54,370
That's all the more reason
for you to understand me.

446
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:57,582
Having a desire may seem
tempting at first.

447
00:31:57,707 --> 00:32:00,126
But the truth is, it's venomous, stinging,

448
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,462
and extremely painful.

449
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,467
I can endure all that

450
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,928
because I was once a human too.

451
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:14,557
-What?
-The day you pushed me into the water,

452
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,019
I started to remember who I was.

453
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:20,480
Yeon-seo's first audience

454
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:24,025
and the boy who watched her dance
for the first time

455
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:27,820
was me.

456
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:31,574
I believe it's the deity's providence

457
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:33,576
that I was sent to her

458
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,495
and that you and I met.

459
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:38,623
I've seen countless fools go down

460
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:40,583
after jumping to the conclusion
that certain incidents

461
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:42,669
were planned out by the deity.

462
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,295
You can't become human.

463
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,464
Even if the deity allows it,

464
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:49,175
I won't let you become human.

465
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:54,806
You're here.

466
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,519
You can't become human.

467
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:00,603
Why not?

468
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:06,609
Because for that to happen,
Yeon-seo needs to die.

469
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:18,788
I got some rapeseeds.

470
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:22,625
I wanted to plant them as a way
of remembering our reunion.

471
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:26,004
But in order for them
to blossom next spring,

472
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,213
I need to plant them this fall.

473
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:29,507
So I'm going to prepare pots
for them in advance.

474
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:34,345
"Next spring"?

475
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:39,100
When fall comes,
let's plant them together.

476
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,270
Only an angel who has received true love

477
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:43,771
can become a human.

478
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,322
-I'll do it.
-Okay.

479
00:33:57,243 --> 00:34:00,329
Sacrificial love is your ticket

480
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:03,416
to becoming a human.

481
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:45,041
-Hi.
-Did you see her?

482
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:46,250
Did you?

483
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,002
I'm afraid.

484
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:18,407
"Do you think the accident
three years ago was a coincidence?

485
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,035
Stop your mom."

486
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:23,913
-Hello.
-Hello.

487
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:44,392
Are you really just going
to be my understudy?

488
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:46,602
Yes.

489
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:48,563
I'm only going
to practice Giselle's parts.

490
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:49,981
It's a waste.

491
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:53,526
You've given it your all,
yet you're not going to dance on stage?

492
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:54,569
Mind your own business.

493
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:58,614
Ni-na.

494
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:02,660
The accident from three years ago
won't happen again.

495
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,414
That accident

496
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:09,375
wasn't a coincidence?

497
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:12,170
Did you know about it as well?

498
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,464
Are you also one of them?

499
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,261
What do you mean?

500
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,098
If you're expecting it to happen again,

501
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,142
it'll be nothing but a pipe dream.

502
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:33,065
Yeon-seo.

503
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:36,861
May I speak with you?

504
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:45,161
What is it?

505
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:46,829
I'm sorry.

506
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:54,712
I'm sorry. I should've told you sooner.

507
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,137
What are these?

508
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:06,307
Associate Director Keum handed
them out before the audition.

509
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:08,935
She tried

510
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,187
to bribe you?

511
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:13,773
I'm sorry. I'm going to give it back.

512
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:15,983
I only wore it once.

513
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,861
It seems like she met each of us secretly.

514
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:24,075
We agreed to give them back,
but she wanted to come clean first.

515
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:28,579
There's nothing I could've done if you
accepted the bribes and voted for Ni-na.

516
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:31,999
Because that would've meant that
my dance was worth less than the money.

517
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:37,213
Thank you for telling me.

518
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:40,007
By the way, Jeong-eun, you didn't go
to the hospital yet, did you?

519
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:40,967
You should go.

520
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:48,224
-She's amazing.
-You fool.

521
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:04,615
I believe it's the deity's providence
that I was sent to her.

522
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:07,576
What do I need to do to become a human?

523
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:15,960
Come in.

524
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:19,630
Do you have a moment?

525
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,307
I didn't see you at practice.

526
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,769
I didn't want you to feel uncomfortable.

527
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,981
It seems like you're the one
who is feeling uncomfortable.

528
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,442
That's exactly why I'm here.

529
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:42,486
We'll be seeing more of each other,
so we shouldn't be uncomfortable.

530
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:44,572
I came to give you my answer.

531
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:48,117
I'm going to turn you down
once and for all, but politely.

532
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:54,290
-I'll wait.
-No, please don't.

533
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:56,959
I already like someone else.

534
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,002
He's not

535
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:00,796
even human.

536
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,174
How...

537
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:04,884
How did you

538
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:07,136
know?

539
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:14,018
You even told me last time
that I was being deceived by him.

540
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,024
I saw him that day when you fell.

541
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:22,151
For now,

542
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,362
it'll feel like a dream.

543
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,864
Having your own guardian angel
must feel wonderful.

544
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:30,117
However, you'll have to wake up
sooner or later.

545
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:31,619
I'll wait until then.

546
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:35,289
Even if I wake up from that dream,
I won't choose to be with you.

547
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:38,793
You can hate me. I actually hope you will.

548
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:41,629
I hope we never talk
about this ever again.

549
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:43,339
Please.

550
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:46,467
Like this.

551
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:51,972
You can film now.

552
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:53,140
Okay.

553
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,728
How long do you think it'll last?

554
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:03,234
Don't tell me you thought
an angel would stay here forever.

555
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:06,278
Dan.

556
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:07,571
Yes?

557
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,907
Keep me in your sight.

558
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,120
I will.

559
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:32,972
Sacrificial love is your ticket

560
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:35,641
to becoming a human.

561
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:39,353
Because for that to happen,
Yeon-seo needs to die.

562
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:41,230
No.

563
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:43,399
No.

564
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:48,404
What is it?

565
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:49,947
Did I look weird?

566
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:53,117
Do you have to die?

567
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:54,785
Is that the only way?

568
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:56,620
Of course.

569
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:59,039
Act Two will only begin
after Giselle dies.

570
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:01,292
That's the only way for her
to save Albrecht.

571
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:03,043
No.

572
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:05,004
I'm sure he didn't wish for that.

573
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:10,342
Don't become too immersed in it.
It's not like I'm actually dying.

574
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:16,432
Let me do it again. Film me well.

575
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,184
Okay.

576
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:37,495
Hu.

577
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,581
Hu!

578
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,044
May I ask who you are?

579
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,880
You don't have to put up an act here.
I'm here alone.

580
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,634
-Pardon?
-There's something I must check.

581
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:55,221
I don't understand.

582
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:01,352
You're really not Hu?

583
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:02,770
No, I didn't.

584
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:05,439
Listen. That wasn't me.

585
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:06,899
Be quiet.

586
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:09,151
How could a priest do such a thing?

587
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:11,862
If you're going to be a pervert,
take off your gown at least.

588
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:14,114
If you're going to be a priest,
take off the trench coat.

589
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:15,950
Wait, listen.

590
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,079
Fine.

591
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:25,084
Let's say that I did urinate on the street
because that's probably what you remember.

592
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:28,087
Even so, you cannot lock me up
here for days.

593
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:29,421
Isn't that against your law?

594
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,173
You, there. Be quiet!

595
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,383
Goodness.

596
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:35,511
-Excuse me.
-Come on, just sit down.

597
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:38,013
Darn it.

598
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:40,641
Wait. Please wait, officer.

599
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,278
Bring me back to the church.

600
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:57,032
Come on, it's driving me crazy.

601
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:02,079
Aren't you being too cruel?

602
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:04,290
It was only once.

603
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:06,875
It happened only once.

604
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:09,169
Must you go this far?

605
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:12,673
After your first time,
you're on a fast track to repeat it.

606
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:16,343
Who are you?

607
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,053
The first time is always the hardest.

608
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:22,057
But after the first time, the next time
it's easier and you don't even notice it.

609
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:24,893
Don't pout and just do
what they tell you to do.

610
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:26,729
And stop thinking so much.

611
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:28,897
You'll only make things complicated.

612
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:34,320
Father.

613
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:37,948
Ms. Park Bok-sun, please come on out.

614
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:39,992
If you eat without paying the bill again,

615
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:41,660
you'll receive a harsher
punishment next time.

616
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:43,704
When did this world become so heartless?

617
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:44,788
Wait.

618
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:50,753
Are you the Lord?

619
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:55,090
Do you want to go see our Lord with me?

620
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:58,177
The lord of soju, the lord of beer,
or the lord of liquor?

621
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,595
Which lord would you like?

622
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,096
Come on out now.

623
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:02,931
Why is he so fussy?

624
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:04,183
Come out now.

625
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:08,020
Hey, hey.

626
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:10,564
Hey.

627
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:13,025
Please sit down.

628
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,737
Go back to your spot.

629
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:19,323
Goodness.

630
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:42,680
STATEMENT

631
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:45,349
MY NAME IS PARK GWANG-IL
I WORK AT FANTASIA...

632
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:53,190
PARK GWANG-IL

633
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:55,109
I'm sure it's from Mr. Park.

634
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:57,945
I think you helped him
make up his mind that day.

635
00:44:58,404 --> 00:44:59,405
TRAFFIC ACCIDENT REPORT

636
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:05,411
Then,

637
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:07,871
shall we get started?

638
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,707
It will be hard to arrest them right away.

639
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:12,334
It's only circumstantial evidence at best.

640
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:14,503
We'll check if the statement is true.

641
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:15,671
I hope you can help us.

642
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:18,132
Call me any time
if there's anything you need.

643
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:20,926
If we start from the accident
three years ago,

644
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:24,555
we will be able to find a connection
to Mr. Cho's accident.

645
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:28,434
DO YOU THINK THE ACCIDENT
3 YEARS AGO WAS A COINCIDENCE?

646
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:29,560
STOP YOUR MOM

647
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:34,606
There's no way.

648
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:37,025
I'm sure it's a misunderstanding.

649
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:52,583
You don't have practice today?

650
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:54,376
No.

651
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:57,796
Mom.

652
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:01,008
Mom, you love me, don't you?

653
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:05,053
Of course, I love you. I'm your mother.

654
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:10,225
I need to ask you a question.

655
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:16,648
Honey.

656
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:18,358
Come on out now.

657
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,000
What brings you here?

658
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:37,085
Yeon-seo, isn't this your first time
coming here?

659
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:39,087
Where is Ru-na?

660
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:41,590
You just missed her. She was in a hurry.

661
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:42,883
Come inside.

662
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:51,767
Sit with me.

663
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:54,478
You too.

664
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,898
Lie low for the time being.

665
00:46:58,273 --> 00:47:01,151
Yeon-seo knows everything.
She's putting on an act.

666
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:02,444
I'm sorry.

667
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:04,154
I'll need you soon.

668
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:05,405
I'll call you.

669
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:06,865
I won't make any mistakes this time.

670
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:12,579
It's probably that man

671
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:14,915
who kidnapped me and threatened Mr. Moon

672
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:16,792
three years ago.

673
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:23,715
Hello.

674
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:27,344
Nice to see you again.

675
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:31,932
You foolish one.

676
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:34,601
Turn from evil

677
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:36,436
and do good.

678
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:44,361
Hello? Why aren't you answering me?

679
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:45,946
Jun-su.

680
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:47,573
Jun-su!

681
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,730
IDENTIFICATION CARD
MOON JI-UNG

682
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:43,545
"From 2017 to 2019,

683
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:47,299
I was instigated by the owner
of Fantasia Ballet Theater,

684
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:50,469
Choi Yeong-ja, to obstruct with
Lee Yeon-seo's cornea donation."

685
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:53,138
How did you...

686
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:55,932
"I was instigated

687
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:57,934
by Choi Yeong-ja to plot a scheme to put

688
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:01,438
ballerina Lee Yeon-seo
in a predicament on Fantasia's Night.

689
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:03,357
Although the scheme failed,

690
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,816
I report that

691
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:08,111
she deliberately tried to hurt
ballerina Lee Yeon-seo."

692
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,321
Stop it!

693
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:10,614
That's enough.

694
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:15,577
I didn't do it. It's a conspiracy.
It's fabricated.

695
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:19,247
Have you gone mad?

696
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:22,626
Everyone can write some trash
like this on a piece of paper.

697
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:23,835
Get out of my house now.

698
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:37,057
Why do you need this now?

699
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:41,061
It's natural for a general director
to be interested in her dancers.

700
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:43,814
Every vote from each dancer
is very valuable.

701
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,649
Are you planning to buy their votes

702
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:47,609
for the audition?

703
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:51,113
Why would you describe it like that?
I'm just supporting them.

704
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:52,531
That sounds scary, you know.

705
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:54,157
What's this?

706
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:56,535
Why don't you go to England
and see your kids?

707
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:58,328
Three months will be enough, right?

708
00:49:58,662 --> 00:49:59,621
If I go,

709
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:02,374
will you get rid of me
before anyone finds out?

710
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:04,459
Just like what happened to
Moon Ji-ung three years ago?

711
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:10,716
Did you

712
00:50:12,008 --> 00:50:13,343
buy off the corps' votes?

713
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,559
What is this?
I won't let this slide, Mr. Park.

714
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:22,477
What do you mean? Will you kill him

715
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:26,064
just like Mr. Moon and Mr. Cho?

716
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:34,531
If I could, I would like
to do the same thing to you.

717
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,868
I would like to make you beg for your life

718
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:41,997
like a madwoman in a shattered car
at the edge of a cliff.

719
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:47,419
But I'm holding myself back
for the sake of Fantasia.

720
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:50,839
I'll give you 24 hours.

721
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:52,758
I want you to resign.

722
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:55,093
I don't want this dirty and nasty story

723
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:57,554
to mar the reputation of Fantasia.

724
00:50:57,971 --> 00:51:00,724
Don't be stubborn
unless you want to be dragged out

725
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:03,810
with cuffs on along with your daughter
in front of our sponsors.

726
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:08,064
You must

727
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,067
put an end to this yourself.

728
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:20,160
Ending things
on a good note is all that matters.

729
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:24,456
Someone told me that.

730
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:08,625
KIM DAN

731
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:13,922
I just came out.

732
00:52:14,714 --> 00:52:17,884
I know. I'm looking at you right now.

733
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:39,865
It was tough to do that alone, wasn't it?

734
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:41,575
It was fine.

735
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:44,744
You must've been surprised
because it rained.

736
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:47,998
I found Mr. Moon's bag.

737
00:52:48,164 --> 00:52:49,958
We can take care of everything with that.

738
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:52,168
Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

739
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:54,588
Yeon-seo, I'm an angel.

740
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:57,257
I wouldn't lose even if 100 guys
like him came.

741
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:03,430
Don't tell me you thought
an angel would stay here forever.

742
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:11,021
Let's stay inside

743
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:13,565
when it rains for the rest of our lives.

744
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:15,650
It's actually better.

745
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:18,862
You only get your feet wet
if you go out on a rainy day.

746
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:24,492
Let's stay home and listen
to the raindrops next to each other.

747
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:27,329
Let's do that.

748
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:31,810
Stop looking at me.

749
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:35,605
You're up.

750
00:54:36,147 --> 00:54:38,358
I look ugly when I sleep.

751
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:45,615
I'm probably the one
who saw you sleep the most often.

752
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:47,409
Stop it.

753
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:49,911
You're pretty.

754
00:54:50,745 --> 00:54:51,830
You look really pretty.

755
00:55:15,311 --> 00:55:16,896
I believe it's the deity's providence

756
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:19,024
that I was sent to her

757
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:23,069
and that you and I met.

758
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:26,281
Even if I wake up from that dream,
I won't choose to be with you.

759
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:02,025
JI KANG-WOO

760
00:56:15,371 --> 00:56:16,456
Yes, this is Lee Yeon-seo.

761
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:18,333
Come out.

762
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:21,336
I will not meet you privately.

763
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:24,130
I have something
to tell you about Kim Dan.

764
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:38,478
KIM DAN

765
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:43,900
-Yes.
-Where are you?

766
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:47,028
You weren't in the practice room
or in your room.

767
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:48,071
Where are you?

768
00:56:49,405 --> 00:56:51,032
I came out for a walk.

769
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:53,660
I saw that Gureum is still here.
Did you go by yourself?

770
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:54,911
Yes, I had to get something.

771
00:56:55,411 --> 00:56:56,621
I'm nearby.

772
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:01,376
I'll be home soon. Don't worry.

773
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,545
Call me. I'll go out and meet you.

774
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:04,629
Okay.

775
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:17,350
I came to ask you a question too.

776
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:21,146
What did you mean
by what you said last time?

777
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:24,190
That an angel can't stay here forever.

778
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:27,193
It literally means what I said.
What else could it mean?

779
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:31,489
It means he will

780
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:34,325
go back to paradise.

781
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:38,830
Why are you laughing?

782
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:39,956
Then

783
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:42,417
will you stop this now?

784
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:46,254
He came as he wanted
and will leave when he wants.

785
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:50,675
You aren't a fool who would be
with someone that will have to leave.

786
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:53,470
People die too.

787
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:56,639
No one can stay with you
until the day you die.

788
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,391
I know that the best.

789
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:01,603
If we do not have much time left,

790
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:05,732
then I will love him even more
so that I won't regret anything.

791
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:13,281
Who said he will go back to paradise?

792
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:14,657
Did Dan say that?

793
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:16,701
It must be your speculation

794
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:20,079
because angels can't lie.

795
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:21,998
I'm sure he didn't say

796
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:23,833
he'll return to paradise.

797
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,043
Stop beating around the bush.

798
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:26,503
What do you mean?

799
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:27,545
Like dust

800
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:29,797
and powder...

801
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:33,009
He will disappear.

802
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:36,971
Why?

803
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:41,851
-Why?
-The deity is very jealous.

804
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:45,271
He doesn't want
what's His to be taken away.

805
00:58:45,563 --> 00:58:46,606
Kim Dan

806
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:49,442
will dissipate

807
00:58:50,568 --> 00:58:51,945
because of your love.

808
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:05,833
It's not over yet. I'm looking for a way.

809
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:08,670
To stay with you.

810
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:21,349
Kim Dan

811
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:23,893
will dissipate

812
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:26,437
because of your love.

813
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:35,863
I make my confession.

814
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:38,992
You told me to look after this human,

815
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:41,160
but I began to want her.

816
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:44,455
You told me to look
into what's in a human's heart,

817
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:47,333
but I keep on looking into my heart.

818
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:50,503
And from my heart,

819
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:53,381
my soul talks to me.

820
00:59:54,632 --> 00:59:56,509
I wanted to ask You this
for the first time.

821
00:59:59,053 --> 00:59:59,971
Why am I

822
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:01,848
not a human?

823
01:00:03,057 --> 01:00:04,601
Why am I on this side

824
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:06,936
when she is on that side?

825
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:22,535
Can we be angels to one another?

826
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:25,246
No, if it's possible,

827
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:27,165
I wish to be

828
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:29,417
a human to her.

829
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:35,214
I wish to be a human
who can embrace her with my warmth.

830
01:00:35,381 --> 01:00:36,799
Will you be reprimanded

831
01:00:36,924 --> 01:00:38,926
back in paradise?

832
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:41,262
I wish to be a human

833
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:44,641
who can lie and say,
"Everything is all right."

834
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:48,269
I wish to be a human
who can sometimes forget

835
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:50,396
painful memories.

836
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:53,983
I wish to be a human who can bleed

837
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,611
because of a cut from a knife,
so that she could

838
01:00:57,403 --> 01:00:58,738
blow on it to make it better.

839
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:02,742
They may be as fragile as glass, weak,

840
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:04,369
and a mess,

841
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:08,498
but I wish to be a human
who can risk one's life

842
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:10,625
for love.

843
01:01:11,709 --> 01:01:13,086
I wish to risk my life

844
01:01:14,295 --> 01:01:15,421
to love.

845
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:17,757
Is this

846
01:01:19,258 --> 01:01:20,343
possible?

847
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:23,221
I will find a way.

848
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:26,224
A way that does not require

849
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:28,935
Yeon-seo's sacrifice or her life.

850
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:33,398
I will make sure I find a way to save her.

851
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:36,818
Even if it means

852
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:40,488
I must turn my back from You.

853
01:02:00,925 --> 01:02:02,093
What's wrong?

854
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:03,761
Did you cry?

855
01:02:13,479 --> 01:02:15,440
Why? What's wrong?

856
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:21,070
Nothing.

857
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:23,573
I just

858
01:02:25,658 --> 01:02:26,826
missed you

859
01:02:28,202 --> 01:02:29,370
so much.

860
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:34,625
Me too.

861
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:37,253
I missed you too.

862
01:02:55,605 --> 01:03:00,401
REPORT

863
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:41,025
With him, I will never pretend like

864
01:03:41,275 --> 01:03:44,570
I'm not here when I am,
or that I don't like him when I do.

865
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:46,447
Come out to the living room in 30 minutes.

866
01:03:46,531 --> 01:03:47,615
We're going on a picnic.

867
01:03:47,698 --> 01:03:49,116
Let's see who wins.

868
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:52,036
I'm going to do everything
that I want to do with Dan.

869
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:55,414
How did you become a human?

870
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:58,000
Will everything really disappear?

871
01:03:58,292 --> 01:04:00,044
She's crying because of you!

872
01:04:00,127 --> 01:04:02,338
You will also get destroyed like me!

873
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:05,591
Dan. Since it's sunny,

874
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:07,844
do you want to get married?
