1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,500
    
What are we going to do?

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,100
Director Ji does whatever he says.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,100
Can we just stay here and do volunteer work?

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,940
Hey, can't you tell that he's throwing bait to us to make some of us return?

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,010
If we just sit around on strike, it'll only make us feel bad.

6
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:16,980
But if we do charity work, we'll get good energy. Let's hold out.

7
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,550
Ni Na, any ideas?

8
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:24,490
What do you think about having a talk with them? We need to talk to them to negotiate.

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,550
Are we going to go there obediently after he gave us an ultimatum? That's as good as saying we give up.

10
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:36,930
How did you find us?

11
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,230
I came to do volunteer work.

12
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,760
I'm a part of Fantasia Ballet Theatre.

13
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:53,080


14
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,820
Stop putting on a show and go. Since when did you do things with us?

15
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:05,700
Starting now. I want to do things as a member of the corps.

16
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,640
Who says you can?

17
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,950
Hey, just let her do it. The more help we have, the better.

18
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:15,750
I assure you that she'll leave crying in an hour.

19
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,700
Do you like dancing?

20
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,780
♫  These little feelings are so old  ♫

21
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,430
♫  You're like the noises in my head  ♫

22
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,150
All right, here comes Lee Yeon Seo! It's Lee Yeon Seo!

23
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:59,750
♫  You'll think of reasons when you're there, sometimes it's true  ♫

24
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:05,150
♫  I think of you and when I'm down  ♫

25
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,890
♫  I think of you  ♫

26
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:09,250
♫  And I'm crazy over you  ♫

27
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,520
Let's dance amongst ourselves!

28
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,740
Miss.

29
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,960
Not a word. I'm tired.

30
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,000
MIss! Congratulations!

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,710
I heard you put the sponsors' association in their place today.

32
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:51,020
People say that everything has its use and that was a great way to use your temper.

33
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,950
Come on, blow them out. Make a wish, too.

34
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:58,970
"Giselle" will do great! Lee Yeon Seo, you'll do even better! One, two, three!

35
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,850
What was that?

36
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:07,540
The ballet theatre is on strike, so she's feeling the worst right now.

37
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,760
Why are you telling me this now? You should have told me before.

38
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,900
I was really out of it this afternoon, too.

39
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,910
What? I look like I'm completely clueless.

40
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,770
You don't know where the corps is?

41
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,940
I'll report back before lunch.

42
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:40,620
No, there's no need. Make an audition announcement for new members now.

43
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,620
- Director Ji. 
- Make sure the résumé screenings and interviews happen soon.

44
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:49,650
What are we going to do? It's 10:00 a.m. Can we do this?

45
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:52,420
What if we really get fired?

46
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,430
We took a stand. Let's push ahead.

47
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,160
Ni Na's on our side. They wouldn't fire us all.

48
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,630
Good morning, everyone!

49
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,250
Good morning.

50
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,950
Hello.

51
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,380
Hello, good morning.

52
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,930
Where are you?! My husband.

53
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,570
Where is he? Where did he go?

54
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:24,310
He must have left without me. He left me all alone.

55
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:29,320
Ma'am, I'll hold your hand. Take my hand and calm—

56
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,310
She lost her mind again.

57
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,620
Sir.

58
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:40,660
Take me with you. I can't live in a world without you.

59
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,980
Don't do this, ma'am. Calm down.

60
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,090
Mi Wook!

61
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,060
Mi Wook! Mi Wook!

62
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,500
I'm here. It's okay.

63
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,820
Let's go.

64
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,140
Get them out of here quickly.

65
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:29,180
Help everyone out of here.

66
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,140
Hurry!

67
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:41,950
What happened?

68
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,970
This old lady...

69
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:49,280
I did it. I did it.

70
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,930
Are you okay?

71
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,320
Leave, before we get kicked out because of you.

72
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,220
I apologize. I meant well.

73
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,620
One more show of goodwill and you'll burn down the building.

74
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,840
I just... wanted to show you all that I'm sincere.

75
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:16,480
Sincere about what? Ah, you being the leader while we make you look good?

76
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,730
If the princess volunteered with us, did you think we'd be touched by your efforts,

77
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:24,060
and shed tears with you and come back to the stage?

78
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,540
Unni, no one wants to remain a backup dancer forever.

79
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,900
That's right. This isn't a joke.

80
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:35,360
You regained your sight long ago and this is the first time you came to see us, because you need us.

81
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:44,500
Why did you lie? You didn't start the fire.

82
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:50,490
Things could've gotten worse. What if they decided to make her leave?

83
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:53,130
Our Young Lady got so nice.

84
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,920
I'm not nasty. I'm just impartial.

85
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,270
They'll understand your sincerity.

86
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:07,710
Because... they all love to dance as well.

87
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:12,250
 I watched them clean up and they were all dancing. 

88
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,930
 It was a nice sight. They all looked like leads. 

89
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:23,350
Do you think... they don't get that you want to come back after three years?

90
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:29,590
They're shutting you out now because they're upset and hurt. But if you perform together,

91
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:32,330
I bet it'll be a great sight.

92
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:39,050
A lead?

93
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,580
Gi Cheon?

94
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,330
Gwang Il.

95
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,560
Why are you here?

96
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,780
What about you? Are you here to see Ms. Lee?

97
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:26,740
I don't have an appointment but...

98
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,760
Let me see.

99
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,520
Hey, Gwang Il! Gwang Il! Hey, Gwang Il.

100
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,450
- Gwang Il!
 - Don't follow me.

101
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:41,580
He should've rung the bell.

102
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,130
What is he doing outside someone's home?

103
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:54,890
Are you afraid Yeon Seo's here?

104
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:56,070
No.

105
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:00,880
She wouldn't come back after yesterday if she has a conscience. Let's go.

106
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,440
 The current time is 9:49 a.m. 

107
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:09,000
My gosh, this is amazing!

108
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,460
I just pressed a button.

109
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:15,320
Also, if you press this down and talk,

110
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,780
you can call your husband.

111
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,940
What did you save his number as?

112
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:23,060
"My old man." That's what he is.

113
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:28,610
Then give it a go. Press this down and say, "Call my old man."

114
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,570
Call my old man.

115
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,190
Aigoo, you're doing so well, Mi Wook.

116
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:45,470
But are we allowed to accept this?

117
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:51,740
You paid for the repairs and took the blame for the fire we caused.

118
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:58,440
I'm so sorry. I should be dead and gone at my age, but I'm not and I keep losing my mind.

119
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:03,340
No, ma'am. You can do just fine even if you're blind.

120
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,540
I'll help you.

121
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:10,260
Y-Yeon Seo.

122
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,460
Let's go. The director's waiting.

123
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,690
Can you excuse us?

124
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,000
What is it? Why did you call me here?

125
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,500
I want to propose something to you and the director.

126
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,600
"Giselle," let's hold an audition.

127
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:58,400
I sincerely want to work with you all.

128
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,800
You kept Fantasia going for the past three years.

129
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,500
The new corps isn't Fantasia to me.

130
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,400
Let's compete officially and fairly.

131
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,200
From soloist to corps de ballet, everyone can participate.

132
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,600
Of course, I get the right as well.

133
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,300
If I don't pass, I'll start from the corps de ballet.

134
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,600
Who says there can be an audition?

135
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,600
I don't want a free ride. This is the best and the most correct way.

136
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,200
To me, there is only one Giselle.

137
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,600
There's no need to make things harder.

138
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,800
I said I'd sort things out.

139
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,000
Why don't you trust me?

140
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,800
Thank you for believing in me.

141
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,000
Even when I didn't even believe in myself,

142
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,400
you pushed your way in and made me dance.

143
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,200
Trust me again.

144
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,600
It might be an endless tunnel, but it will be easier together.

145
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,000
How about a group cheer?

146
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Fantasia! Fantasia!

147
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,200
Let's do this!

148
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,600
Hello? Teacher Elena...

149
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,300
- Teacher Elena. 
- Darn it.

150
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,730
I need you.

151
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,000
Teacher Elena.

152
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Teach me.

153
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,900
Teach me!

154
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,400
Teach me!

155
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,100
You can't take all that!

156
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,400
Teacher Elena, teach me!

157
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,100
Teach me.

158
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,400
Teacher Elena. Teacher Elena, will you teach me?

159
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,600
Get lost! I told you to pay for that!

160
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,700
- No, no! 
- Let go!

161
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,800
You dropped this. I picked it up.

162
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,400
You don't do this kind of stuff.

163
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:22,100
Are you saying I'm a kind, soft-hearted, and boring girl who always follows the rules?

164
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,600
You know it well. You're boring and no fun.

165
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,600
I'm going to throw away that side of me.

166
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,800
That's why I need you.

167
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,200
Please make me a totally new ballerina.

168
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,200
You've been living like a softie for 26 years. Why all of a sudden?

169
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,300
I want to... beat Yeon Seo.

170
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,100
I'll do whatever it takes. I'll beat her no matter what.

171
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,300
I should buy cucumbers, too. These cucumbers look fresh.

172
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:44,000
Oh my, what's all this? Are you going to cook a meal for your girlfriend?

173
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,600
No, she's not my girlfriend.

174
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,800
- Then, it is for your wife? 
- Aigoo!

175
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:53,400
She's not my wife. Well, she's not my girlfriend, wife, or anything.

176
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,400
If she's not anything, what are you doing here?

177
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:02,490
Why didn't you write your report?

178
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,000
You scared me!

179
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,420
Have you given up on everything?

180
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,800
Where's your report?

181
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,600
Why are you doing this? Why?

182
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,800
This girl has a hard life. What can I do?

183
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,600
I see her having a problem after a problem.

184
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,800
When will she date

185
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,000
and fall in love? She needs to take care of her problems first.

186
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,400
Right. Two months.

187
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,400
You think you have all the time in the world, don't you?

188
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,000
Senior, here's my big picture.

189
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,800
Once she's free of problems and has time to look after herself, she's bound to fall in love with that Rib or somebody.

190
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,200
I haven't given up yet.

191
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,600
You really know nothing about humans.

192
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:02,630
No human in this world falls in love after getting everything ready.

193
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:06,970
If that was the case, why do you think that poor guy, Heungbu, had ten children?

194
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:13,000
Anyway, I'm going to focus on Yeon Seo's happiness for the time being.

195
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,700
I'll submit all the reports I'm behind with at once. Okay?

196
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,200
My goodness.

197
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,200
 Those who oppress the righteous person and deprive the poor  

198
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,800
 have many faults and a grave sin. 

199
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,500
 But you can't just go down the fiery pit when some whimsical man sends you there. 

200
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,800
 I can't explain this in detail, but especially someone like me can't go to that place. 

201
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,200
 I haven't given up yet. 

202
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,400
 I'll submit all the reports I'm behind on at once. 

203
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,300
Believe in God's mercy

204
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:44,000
and confess all of the sins you've committed so far.

205
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,700
Father, do angels exist?

206
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,200
I'm sure they're fulfilling their duties

207
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,800
in places where they can't be seen as loyal servants of God.

208
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,900
What about an angel that can be seen? I bet he violated religious precepts.

209
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,400
Angels can't be seen by human eyes.

210
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,000
What if someone did?

211
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
What happens to the angel when a human finds out their true identity?

212
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,800
I believe you're mistaken, brother.

213
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:18,000
Father, it sounds like you know nothing about angels,

214
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,600
or for some reason, you have to pretend that you don't know.

215
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,600
This is where you confess your sins.

216
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,600
You're not here to test me.

217
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,400
Please go back.

218
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,600
What? What is this about?

219
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,400
It's nothing. I'll see you around.

220
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,780
What are you doing?

221
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:12,390
The past few days have been hard for you. You barely ate, too.

222
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:16,580
I was trying to cook something for you, but it turned out to be a mess.

223
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,760


224
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,430
Let me help, too.

225
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:27,010
Wait a second.

226
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:28,680
You should put this on first.

227
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,450
I don't need it.

228
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:31,730
Wait, just hold on for a second.

229
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,130
You need to put this on.

230
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,070
♫  Forget...  ♫

231
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:35,840

♫  As cool as the sea. Yeah, I will drown  ♫

237

Ow. Just stop. Don't bother me.

240
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,520

What should I do?

244
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:08,350
Go wash this.

245
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,450
Do I wash all of this? Or just these two?

246
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:12,830
♫  show that you love me  ♫

247
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:16,580
I'll do it. Ah, it's dangerous if you chop like this!

248
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:19,800
That's not how you do it.

249
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,550
♫   Why don't you show me, show that you love me  ♫

All right, I got it!

252
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:30,450
This is how you should chop.

253
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:32,320
I can smell something burning.

254
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,690
I'll take care of it!

255
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:36,650
Are you okay?

256
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:38,590
Don't come closer!

257
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,310
Hold on.

258
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:53,570
If your feet had gotten injured, you would've been in big trouble.

259

♫  I just fall   ♫

260

279
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:36,490
 Hey, you over there. 

280
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:38,740
 Be careful! 

281
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:54,920
 Are you all right? 

282
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,460
 I'm Yeon Seo, Lee Yeon Seo. 

283
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,180
 And you are? 

284
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,170
 I'm... 

285
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,220
It's that dream again.

286
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,760
What was that supposed to be?

287
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,370
Senior!  Senior!

288
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:34,160
Ah, darn it!

289
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:41,570
What? What is it?

290
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,920
Can humans become angels?

291
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,800
- What? 
- What I mean is that

292
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,850
they were human before and somehow ended up dying

293
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:54,860
and then their souls become angels. Does that ever happen?

294
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:59,870
Why are you suddenly asking about the secrets of the spiritual realm?

295
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:02,890
I keep having dreams. There's a young boy.

296
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:05,660
He jumps and falls into the sea and then drowns.

297
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:08,870
But I've never seen this kid before, not even in pictures.

298
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:10,740
I haven't seen him since I was dispatched, either.

299
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:14,190
Then, who is he?

300
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:18,160
Oh, God!

301
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:25,830
This body has serious defects.

302
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:31,620
Now he's even dreaming about things he wishes for.

303
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,000
Things I wish for?

304
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,170
When humans have a wish, they begin to ponder about it over and over again.

305
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,940
Then their brain cells begin to get confused.

306
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,320
Is this the future? The past? Or just their desire?

307
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,940
It's just a side effect. Just forget about it.

308
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:47,090
Dreaming about things I wish for?

309
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:52,920
Senior, are you saying that I wish to be human?

310
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:57,250
Is that even possible? An angel becoming human...

311
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:01,720
Why are you hitting me?!

312
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,560
Follow me.

313
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:16,600
You never explain the most important things. Why are we here? This is a sanatorium.

314
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,590
There he is.

315
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:19,460
Huh?

316
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,790
Isn't it?

317
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,390
Sir!

318
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:32,390
Let's go. We must leave!

319
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,520
We must leave now!

320
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,560
We must leave!

321
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:58,360
Angel Noel, receive your judgment.

322
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:03,000
He's an angel?

323
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:08,460
Please let him go.

324
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,660
You immature being.

325
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:19,730
It's fine even if I disappear this instant,

326
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:23,790
but please spare her.

327
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:27,820
Death is not a punishment.

328
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,900
How dare an angel who refused to bring her to paradise,

329
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,560
speak of the life and death of a human?

330
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:44,230
Where are you? Where did you go?

331
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:46,400
Where are you?

332
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:59,750
Then, please allow me to say my last goodbye.

333
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:02,760
Even a minute is enough for me.

334
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,290
I'm here.

335
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:16,630
I'm here.

336
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:19,610
Don't go. No, don't leave me.

337
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:23,250
You promised to stay with me.

338
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:25,710
I was here for a long time.

339
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:33,150
I was very happy to be able to meet you.

340
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:40,930
I will not forget, my dear Mi Wook.

341
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:47,140
♫  behind the mess, I constantly  ♫

342
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:50,100
♫  obey  ♫

343
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:51,820
No.

344
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,690
Move aside.

345
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,300
Just a little more. Give them just a little more time.

346
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:02,160
♫  To those who say to change  ♫

347
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:11,360
♫  I can say anything that I want, alive  ♫

348
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:17,660
♫  I believe in things that I see, I pray  ♫

349
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:23,680
♫  I don't know if I can anymore, so watch me pray  ♫

350
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:30,190
♫  I can see everything turn away from me  ♫

351
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:35,680
♫  There is a word of God  ♫

352
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:44,160
If you won't listen to what I say, I'll have to show you.

353
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,920
You foolish one. I hope you'll be enlightened.

354
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:17,930
♫  Sometimes the lips, the heart, the word  ♫

355
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:20,030
♫  that strikes the heart  ♫

356
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,490
Grandmother!

357
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:23,870
Grandmother! Grandmother!

358
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:30,380
♫  Sometimes the heart, the silence   ♫

359
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:35,980
♫  away from all recall  ♫

360
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:45,160
♫  I can say anything that I want, alive  ♫

361
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:51,450
♫  I believe in things that I see, I pray  ♫

362
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:57,560
♫  I don't know if I can anymore, so watch me pray  ♫

363
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:03,110
♫  I can see everything turn away from me  ♫

364
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:10,920


365
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,650
You're here.

366
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:16,360
Let's eat breakfast. It's better than yesterday.

367
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,590
Did you go out this early to run?

368
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:23,340
- Do you want water? 
- Miss,

369
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,700
I have something to tell you.

370
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,180
It's really important.

371
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:31,750
What is it?

372
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:36,690
I... want to quit my job.

373
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:41,930
I want to move out.

374
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:46,190
♫  Because of you  ♫

375
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:51,160
♫  You~  ♫

376
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:56,960
♫  If you leave me, I’m broken in my heart  ♫

377
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,190
♫  Because of you  ♫

378
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:06,300
♫  You always  ♫

379
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,730
♫   stay by my side  ♫

380
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:11,650
   

381
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:15,200
 Why Yeon Seo? 

382
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,230
 Why did you send me to her of all people? 

383
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:20,970
 I want to stay with her. 

384
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:22,430
 I got angry and resented him, too, but... 

385
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:25,210
 Pull yourself together, will you? 

386
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:28,510
 Kim Dan may not be the person you think he is. 

387
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,600
 What do you mean? 

388
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,200
 Where is he? I want to ask him something. 

389
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,790
 That naive angel went around acting a little too cute. 

390
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:36,790
 If you lurk around Yeon Seo one more time, 

391
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:40,000
 she'll also find out about the beings of paradise. 

392
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,733
♫  It can’t be explained  ♫
