1
00:00:01,646 --> 00:00:08,676


2
00:00:12,306 --> 00:00:14,176
Are you okay?

3
00:00:16,956 --> 00:00:18,876
Wait for a second.

4
00:00:43,756 --> 00:00:46,086
What was that sound?

5
00:00:47,646 --> 00:00:49,056
   

6
00:00:58,936 --> 00:01:01,836
Are you hurting anywhere?

7
00:01:03,176 --> 00:01:05,066
Your face is...

8
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:12,026
red.

9
00:01:22,116 --> 00:01:25,796
What is this?

10
00:01:28,716 --> 00:01:30,656
What is it?!

11
00:01:33,786 --> 00:01:35,806
Wings.

12
00:01:37,016 --> 00:01:39,186
Are you...

13
00:01:43,306 --> 00:01:45,426
Are you really...

14
00:01:50,286 --> 00:01:54,536
Don't come closer! You'll get hurt.

15
00:01:54,536 --> 00:01:59,886
Wow. I really can't believe it.

16
00:02:04,846 --> 00:02:08,266
I'll explain. Don't be too surprised.

17
00:02:08,266 --> 00:02:12,266
It's fine. There's no pervert who can explain why they are a pervert.

18
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:15,476
You never pick up your phone and you never come when I call you.

19
00:02:15,476 --> 00:02:18,306
It was because you were too busy wearing this kind of clothing.

20
00:02:18,306 --> 00:02:20,586
Whatever I wear...

21
00:02:25,886 --> 00:02:28,406
Then, bye.

22
00:02:31,286 --> 00:02:34,776
Take it off right here.

23
00:02:34,776 --> 00:02:36,906
Take it off in front of my eyes right now.

24
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:39,106
Let go of this!

25
00:02:39,106 --> 00:02:41,616
I told you to take it off!

26
00:02:41,616 --> 00:02:44,486
Let go!

27
00:02:44,486 --> 00:02:48,386
- Take it off!
 - You have to let go for me to take it off!

28
00:02:48,386 --> 00:02:50,606
You have to stay still so that I can take it off of you.

29
00:02:50,606 --> 00:02:55,136
This is disgusting. I'm going to take it off you and burn it up.

30
00:02:55,136 --> 00:02:59,596
What do you mean it's disgusting? Have you ever seen such a big, shining, and wonderful wing before?

31
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,906
Did you just talk informally to me?

32
00:03:02,906 --> 00:03:04,116
Is there a rule that you can be the only one to talk informally?

33
00:03:04,116 --> 00:03:06,646
Hey! Get your actions straight. I'm your employer.

34
00:03:06,646 --> 00:03:10,456
What would you know? You order me around like your dog.

35
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:13,056
You're a blind girl who can't even know or see what is pretty.

36
00:03:13,056 --> 00:03:15,106
- Are you done talking?  
 - No. I'm going to keep talking!

37
00:03:15,106 --> 00:03:19,446
These wings are not wings to hear such horrendous words from you.

38
00:03:19,446 --> 00:03:22,596
You don't even know who is actually sharp and horrendous.

39
00:04:00,466 --> 00:04:07,026
Yeah. With a human eye, you can't even know the difference between a monster, an angel,

40
00:04:07,026 --> 00:04:09,026
or a pervert.

41
00:04:43,586 --> 00:04:47,356
 Lee Yeon Seo! 

42
00:04:47,356 --> 00:04:49,576
Ugh, hold on!

43
00:04:49,576 --> 00:04:51,466
Hey! Call the police.

44
00:04:51,466 --> 00:04:52,956
Yeon Seo.

45
00:04:52,956 --> 00:04:55,196
Hey, it's this guy. What are you doing? Call the police!

46
00:04:55,196 --> 00:04:58,726
What are you even saying? Yeon Seo, it's me.

47
00:04:58,726 --> 00:05:00,756
Hey, hurry!

48
00:05:00,756 --> 00:05:02,616
- Good grief! 
 - Hey!

49
00:05:02,616 --> 00:05:05,096
You withstood that?

50
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:07,396
Stop blabbering nonsense, you little punk— Ouch!

51
00:05:09,746 --> 00:05:12,936
Talk. Who are you and where did you come from.

52
00:05:12,936 --> 00:05:14,856
I'm Ji Kang Woo.

53
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:20,166
The director of Fantasia's ballet, Ji Kang Woo.

54
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:26,286
The New York City ballet? That Ji Kang Woo?

55
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:31,086
   

56
00:05:36,626 --> 00:05:38,276
So you won't report it?

57
00:05:38,276 --> 00:05:41,926
I'll do it on my own, so please leave.

58
00:05:41,926 --> 00:05:44,356
Then I'll do it. Leave this place just as it is.

59
00:05:44,356 --> 00:05:50,216
Hey, Ji Kang Woo, this is my house. Whether I report it or not, I'll decide that myself.

60
00:05:51,066 --> 00:05:52,856
What are you scared of?

61
00:05:52,856 --> 00:05:55,016
It's not that I'm scared but it's just too much work.

62
00:05:55,016 --> 00:05:58,766
There are already people chomping at the bit for an opportunity to talk trash about me as it is.

63
00:05:58,766 --> 00:06:01,236
It's fine, so please leave.

64
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:02,186
I'll help you.

65
00:06:02,186 --> 00:06:08,496
Please. Leaving when I tell you to is how you can help me.

66
00:06:08,496 --> 00:06:09,756
Yeon Seo...

67
00:06:09,756 --> 00:06:12,476
Are you deaf?

68
00:06:16,536 --> 00:06:18,786
She told you to go.

69
00:06:22,036 --> 00:06:23,976
Apologize when you realize you've misunderstood someone.

70
00:06:23,976 --> 00:06:27,786
Apologize first. Got that, Mr. Secretary?

71
00:06:27,786 --> 00:06:29,876
Says the guy that was standing there like the most suspicious person of all.

72
00:06:29,876 --> 00:06:32,636
That's not enough reason to justify pinning a person to the ground.

73
00:06:32,636 --> 00:06:38,546
Well, it's not like I was expecting you to just fall over right away like a paper doll.

74
00:06:38,546 --> 00:06:41,286
Hey, now! A surprise attack like that?

75
00:06:41,286 --> 00:06:44,956
I wasn't expecting you to attack me out of the blue. I'm a refined man of common sense, you see.

76
00:06:44,956 --> 00:06:50,236
So if it wasn't a surprise attack, you would've won?

77
00:06:52,296 --> 00:06:57,056
Was this guy with you when the window broke?

78
00:06:58,566 --> 00:07:01,706
No, but—

79
00:07:01,706 --> 00:07:07,256
In order to break that window, you would have had to throw something from within the yard. An outsider couldn't have done it.

80
00:07:10,486 --> 00:07:15,396
Hey, you were in the yard, weren't you?

81
00:07:17,366 --> 00:07:21,866
Who's the most suspicious person now?

82
00:07:27,186 --> 00:07:30,396
Wow, this fool dares to frame  me  for this?

83
00:07:30,396 --> 00:07:32,856
Since I'm so offended, why don't we just settle this fair and square?

84
00:07:32,856 --> 00:07:35,626
- Have at me! Come on! 
 -  Why, you little—

85
00:07:35,626 --> 00:07:37,256
Enough!

86
00:07:38,676 --> 00:07:42,426
Don't make me repeat myself and just go.

87
00:07:42,426 --> 00:07:48,986
And heed my warning. Don't you dare say a word about what happened today at Fantasia.

88
00:07:54,366 --> 00:07:56,916
Enough. I don't want to hear it.

89
00:08:00,926 --> 00:08:04,166
The door is that way.

90
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:06,666
I know that!

91
00:08:21,476 --> 00:08:23,866
 What are you afraid of? 

92
00:08:39,266 --> 00:08:41,256
 Are you all right? 

93
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:50,456
Quack. Pervert. Nutjob.

94
00:08:52,006 --> 00:08:53,826
Ouch!

95
00:09:22,626 --> 00:09:24,766
Why are you standing here?

96
00:09:24,766 --> 00:09:26,896
Why are you coming out?

97
00:09:33,286 --> 00:09:36,166
Drink this. It's chamomile tea.

98
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:43,936
I read in the paperwork that you drink this when you can't sleep.

99
00:09:44,726 --> 00:09:47,706
You went through a scare earlier.

100
00:09:47,706 --> 00:09:51,596
Who? Me? No, I didn't.

101
00:09:58,366 --> 00:10:02,316
Why do humans lie?

102
00:10:02,316 --> 00:10:05,696
"I'm scared. I'm trembling. I need you."

103
00:10:05,696 --> 00:10:09,026
It's not like you'll be taken to the afterlife for saying that.

104
00:10:12,096 --> 00:10:14,286
Drink this and go to sleep.

105
00:10:25,186 --> 00:10:30,936
I'll stay out here until the morning. Just in case.

106
00:10:30,936 --> 00:10:32,746
♫  1, 2, a 1, 2, 3, 4  ♫

107
00:10:32,746 --> 00:10:34,536
 Don't overreact. 

108
00:10:39,936 --> 00:10:43,256
Apply this and don't slack off your duties because of your foot wounds.

109
00:10:43,256 --> 00:10:51,226
♫  The way you rescued me from summer heat  ♫

110
00:10:51,226 --> 00:10:54,426
Geez, Grumpy.

111
00:10:54,426 --> 00:10:59,516
♫  I'd drown all day if you'd stay with me  ♫

112
00:10:59,516 --> 00:11:04,156
♫  Oh, wouldn't it be better  ♫

113
00:11:04,156 --> 00:11:10,026
♫  If we could decide to stick together  ♫

114
00:11:10,026 --> 00:11:16,856
♫  Give me something sweeter  ♫

115
00:11:16,856 --> 00:11:20,646
♫  Something to show that you love me  ♫

116
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:24,846
♫  Give me something sweeter  ♫

117
00:11:24,846 --> 00:11:30,866
♫  I don't know. Why don't you show me? Show that you love me.  ♫

118
00:11:30,866 --> 00:11:35,416
♫  I want something sweeter  ♫

119
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:42,376
♫  You see, something to show that you love me  ♫

120
00:11:51,886 --> 00:11:54,106
 Get me information on her new secretary. 

121
00:11:54,106 --> 00:11:57,756
 His background, present life, and resume. Get everything. 

122
00:11:59,736 --> 00:12:02,966
What kind of situation is brewing in that house?

123
00:12:51,326 --> 00:12:56,266
H-Hello. D-Do you live in this neighborhood?

124
00:12:56,266 --> 00:12:58,226
What a coincidence.

125
00:12:58,226 --> 00:13:02,836
I heard there was a good dumpling stand next door so I was out buying some.

126
00:13:02,836 --> 00:13:04,726
You're not carrying any though.

127
00:13:04,726 --> 00:13:06,316
I'm about to go buy them now.

128
00:13:06,316 --> 00:13:10,816
- Then be careful on your way. 
 - Yes, thank you.

129
00:13:15,466 --> 00:13:17,296
Ni Na,

130
00:13:19,736 --> 00:13:21,726
have you had dinner yet?

131
00:13:22,066 --> 00:13:29,196
♫  I saw a girl, she was coming  ♫

132
00:13:29,196 --> 00:13:31,306
Why were you waiting for me?

133
00:13:31,846 --> 00:13:35,826
I told you it was just a coincidence. Why are you so distrustful of people?

134
00:13:35,826 --> 00:13:38,346
There's no dumpling stand in this area.

135
00:13:41,686 --> 00:13:45,956
People aren't something that can be trusted willy-nilly.

136
00:13:45,956 --> 00:13:47,616
Why not?

137
00:13:48,226 --> 00:13:50,296
Because they're weak.

138
00:13:51,056 --> 00:13:53,886
Worthy people end up passing away much too early,

139
00:13:53,886 --> 00:13:57,176
while only the selfish, lying people live long lives

140
00:13:57,176 --> 00:14:00,956
betraying people and committing evil deeds.

141
00:14:00,956 --> 00:14:02,596
I don't trust anyone.

142
00:14:02,596 --> 00:14:06,676
Although there are people that deceive and betray others,

143
00:14:06,676 --> 00:14:10,216
one in 100 people doesn't do that.

144
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:13,826
I believe in people willy-nilly and want to believe in even more people than that.

145
00:14:13,826 --> 00:14:18,476
I want to become someone that you can trust as well.

146
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:23,986
You're quite naive. Yeon Seo isn't like that.

147
00:14:24,766 --> 00:14:27,986
Did you meet with Yeon Seo?

148
00:14:32,256 --> 00:14:35,076
That's great. All three of us should meet together

149
00:14:35,076 --> 00:14:39,616
since Yeon Seo is going to start practicing soon, so we should help her as much as we can.

150
00:14:39,616 --> 00:14:42,026
You don't need to lie to me.

151
00:14:42,026 --> 00:14:44,306
I hate hypocrisy and empty promises.

152
00:14:44,306 --> 00:14:47,106
Why do you think I'm not being sincere?

153
00:14:47,106 --> 00:14:51,576
When I studied abroad in Russia, I couldn't wait to wake up in the morning

154
00:14:51,576 --> 00:14:56,056
because I could see Yeon Seo dance then.

155
00:14:56,056 --> 00:14:58,416
I would think to myself that she's living proof that God exists.

156
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:01,506
 God made her with so much detail. 

157
00:15:01,506 --> 00:15:04,236
 He gave her tons of talent. 

158
00:15:05,036 --> 00:15:07,196
My heart would fill with joy watching her.

159
00:15:07,196 --> 00:15:10,306
If it meant that Yeon Seo could dance again as she did before,

160
00:15:10,306 --> 00:15:14,026
then I'm ready to become her understudy again at any time.

161
00:15:14,026 --> 00:15:16,496
I mean that sincerely.

162
00:15:16,496 --> 00:15:18,996
Then, why did you come to find me?

163
00:15:18,996 --> 00:15:21,896
I thought you wanted to argue with me about being the lead.

164
00:15:21,896 --> 00:15:24,796
I keep telling you it was just a coincidence.

165
00:15:24,796 --> 00:15:27,226
I'm going to go to the bathroom real quick.

166
00:15:52,196 --> 00:15:54,446
What's are you doing?

167
00:15:55,316 --> 00:15:57,376
Doing this is a little...

168
00:15:58,506 --> 00:16:03,176
♫  I wanna be your light  ♫

169
00:16:03,176 --> 00:16:05,026
Doing this is...

170
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:09,916
Fortunately, your salivary glands haven't inflamed yet.

171
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:16,976
Geum Ni Na, you just threw up, didn't you?

172
00:16:17,466 --> 00:16:23,736
♫  Stretch your hands  ♫

173
00:16:23,736 --> 00:16:26,016
I had an upset stomach.

174
00:16:26,016 --> 00:16:28,966
It was a one-time thing. I would never do it all the time.

175
00:16:28,966 --> 00:16:33,696
You said you wanted to become a ballerina I can trust?

176
00:16:33,696 --> 00:16:36,386
Ballerinas that eat and throw up followed by binge eating again

177
00:16:36,386 --> 00:16:40,346
eventually end up anorexic. I've seen it happen countless times.

178
00:16:40,346 --> 00:16:41,866
I'm sorry.

179
00:16:41,866 --> 00:16:45,346
Please keep it a secret from my family, especially my sister.

180
00:16:45,346 --> 00:16:48,166
I'm sure they'll blame themselves and be upset.

181
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:50,816
It's all my fault so please just get mad at me.

182
00:16:50,816 --> 00:16:54,416
Who should be worrying about who right now?

183
00:16:54,856 --> 00:16:58,026
Shall I tell you the way to become a great ballerina?

184
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:03,916
♫  How are you doing  ♫

185
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:08,606
Be more selfish. Think of yourself

186
00:17:10,356 --> 00:17:13,076
as more important than anyone else in the world.

187
00:17:38,356 --> 00:17:40,086
Is he sleeping?

188
00:17:47,696 --> 00:17:50,586
Oh my! Miss!

189
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:55,626
You're fully awake right now, right?

190
00:17:55,626 --> 00:17:59,376
Can you tell me again what you said to me over the phone?

191
00:17:59,376 --> 00:18:00,846
Didn't you see the living room on the way upstairs?

192
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:02,496
That's why I'm asking.

193
00:18:02,496 --> 00:18:06,416
Last night someone broke the glass in the living room window

194
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,156
and the chandelier even fell.

195
00:18:08,156 --> 00:18:09,336
Did you have a nightmare?

196
00:18:09,336 --> 00:18:11,966
I'm telling you I almost died!

197
00:18:12,456 --> 00:18:16,236
- It must have been quite a vivid dream then. 
 - There was a witness. Kim Dan.

198
00:18:16,236 --> 00:18:19,626
Where did he go? Kim Dan!

199
00:18:19,626 --> 00:18:21,456
There were no abnormalities with the lighting and windows, right?

200
00:18:21,456 --> 00:18:24,076
- Right, none at all. 
 - Understood.

201
00:18:24,076 --> 00:18:25,796
What's going on here?

202
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:34,776
You're all gathered here far before your scheduled time to work. Are you having a strategy meeting?

203
00:18:36,046 --> 00:18:38,776
I called them here so we could clean before the rest of the employees get here.

204
00:18:38,776 --> 00:18:41,606
We've been working super hard since dawn.

205
00:18:42,516 --> 00:18:45,466
- Hey, watch it with the informal speech. 
- Since I already used it once, we might as well just stick with it.

206
00:18:45,466 --> 00:18:48,476
Besides, I didn't see anything in the contract saying informal speech isn't allowed.

207
00:18:51,386 --> 00:18:55,416
These three people were the ones in charge of the lighting, yard, and security last night.

208
00:18:55,416 --> 00:19:02,326
- And I was—  
 - Good going. I had something I wanted to ask these exact three people.

209
00:19:08,706 --> 00:19:10,586
Who did it?

210
00:19:12,206 --> 00:19:16,536
I asked about it and they said up until they got off work there wasn't anything abnormal with the lighting or windows last night.

211
00:19:16,536 --> 00:19:18,556
And the security guard was the last to leave after all the other employees had gone home.

212
00:19:18,556 --> 00:19:21,426
If you fess up about who did it, I'll forgive you.

213
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:23,026
I keep saying it was just a freak accident.

214
00:19:23,026 --> 00:19:27,286
Or I'll fire you, sue you, report you to the police, make you attend a trial.

215
00:19:27,286 --> 00:19:30,356
Here, read this. I organized everything into chronological order.

216
00:19:30,356 --> 00:19:34,096
While cleaning, we didn't find any rocks or items that could break glass.

217
00:19:34,096 --> 00:19:35,886
It was a freak accident. It just happened by chance.

218
00:19:35,886 --> 00:19:37,956
What a brilliant detective you are.

219
00:19:37,956 --> 00:19:41,646
How about the chandelier then? Why did that suddenly fall?

220
00:19:41,646 --> 00:19:44,596
Did termites nibble it loose?

221
00:19:44,596 --> 00:19:47,006
Why don't you speak with me, okay?

222
00:19:47,566 --> 00:19:51,336
I had a nightmare, you say? I'm delusional, you say?

223
00:19:52,676 --> 00:19:56,836
If you confess who did it, we can end this with a simple firing.

224
00:19:56,836 --> 00:20:02,086
One and two and th—

225
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:04,956
Ah, I can't do this anymore!

226
00:20:04,956 --> 00:20:07,396
Do you think you're some kind of princess or something?

227
00:20:07,396 --> 00:20:08,496
Go on.

228
00:20:08,496 --> 00:20:11,996
I wondered how bad it could be when they offered me twice the salary.

229
00:20:11,996 --> 00:20:14,656
Even twenty times the salary wouldn't be enough for this.

230
00:20:14,656 --> 00:20:18,716
You're unbelievably immature, hysterical, threatening and now you're even framing me as a criminal.

231
00:20:18,716 --> 00:20:20,596
I can't stand it anymore!

232
00:20:20,596 --> 00:20:22,316
Let's get out of here! Come on!

233
00:20:22,316 --> 00:20:24,366
- Just a moment, please! Please wait! 
 - Let's go!

234
00:20:24,366 --> 00:20:26,286
- Wait, please! Hold on! Wait!

235
00:20:26,286 --> 00:20:27,926
-  This is ridiculous. Me, too! 
 - No, please wait!

236
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:29,956
Just a moment! Wait, please! Wa—

237
00:20:32,886 --> 00:20:35,876
We already have rumors going out that this is Hell...

238
00:20:35,876 --> 00:20:38,576
Butler, contact the CCTV company.

239
00:20:38,576 --> 00:20:41,686
Tell them to get all the footage records from the last three days until now.

240
00:20:50,296 --> 00:20:53,666
 Oh my gosh, what's going on?! 

241
00:20:54,356 --> 00:20:57,476
 (CCTV footage) 

242
00:21:14,296 --> 00:21:15,766
Start with the footage from last night.

243
00:21:15,766 --> 00:21:18,526
It happened around sundown so start from about 6:00 p.m.

244
00:21:18,526 --> 00:21:20,886
Yes, I understand.

245
00:21:28,076 --> 00:21:29,526
♫  Yoo-hoo  ♫

246
00:21:29,526 --> 00:21:31,526
♫  Yoo-hoo  ♫

247
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:41,456
♫  Yoo-hoo  ♫

248
00:21:41,456 --> 00:21:43,256
♫  Yoo-hoo  ♫

249
00:21:43,986 --> 00:21:47,016
 Oh no, oh no... 

250
00:21:49,316 --> 00:21:51,106
What's wrong with it?

251
00:21:52,376 --> 00:21:54,466
Oh my, why isn't it showing up?

252
00:21:56,246 --> 00:21:57,836
Oh dear, the footage isn't coming up!

253
00:21:57,836 --> 00:22:01,336
It looks there was a problem with the lines because of the sudden rain.

254
00:22:01,336 --> 00:22:03,466
All the footage is like that until midnight.

255
00:22:03,466 --> 00:22:04,786
Can it be restored?

256
00:22:04,786 --> 00:22:09,216
Because the original footage wasn't recorded correctly, I don't think that will be possible.

257
00:22:09,216 --> 00:22:11,066
I apologize.

258
00:22:14,926 --> 00:22:16,746
♫  Yoo-hoo  ♫

259
00:22:24,866 --> 00:22:25,686
What are you doing?

260
00:22:25,686 --> 00:22:28,806
That's what I should be asking you! Are you trying to advertise the fact that you're an angel to the whole neighborhood?

261
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:30,516
The wings just popped out, out of nowhere!

262
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:35,036
Wings? This guy is driving me crazy.

263
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:39,736
It was the rain, wasn't it? That's the only reason I can think of.

264
00:22:39,736 --> 00:22:40,786
But why?

265
00:22:40,786 --> 00:22:44,626
You said that on the day she sensed you in your angel form it was raining, didn't you?

266
00:22:44,626 --> 00:22:45,326
That's true.

267
00:22:45,326 --> 00:22:48,366
And when you saved her from death it was raining, too.

268
00:22:49,816 --> 00:22:50,606
That meanie!

269
00:22:50,606 --> 00:22:52,336
You have 94 days left.

270
00:22:52,336 --> 00:22:57,596
Humans have a lifespan but we have deadlines.

271
00:22:57,596 --> 00:23:01,036
We just need to love the deity, right?

272
00:23:01,036 --> 00:23:04,586
But humans, especially Lee Yeon Seo, I can't understand her.

273
00:23:04,586 --> 00:23:09,726
Has she ever liked someone? According to me, I'm not sure there's a person whom the thought of makes her happy.

274
00:23:09,726 --> 00:23:13,046
Bone for bone. Flesh for flesh.

275
00:23:14,016 --> 00:23:16,376
You should look for Lee Yeon Seo's ribs first.

276
00:23:16,376 --> 00:23:18,496
Isn't it the other way round? The man's ribs shoul—

277
00:23:18,496 --> 00:23:21,056
What's wrong with you? It's the 21st century.

278
00:23:21,056 --> 00:23:25,216
Ribs. Human call this...

279
00:23:27,526 --> 00:23:29,826
fate.

280
00:23:32,356 --> 00:23:34,346
Yeon Seo is inside, right?

281
00:23:35,996 --> 00:23:38,046
Wait here.

282
00:23:39,306 --> 00:23:41,536
Have a good day, Sir.

283
00:23:41,536 --> 00:23:44,776
Yes. Return safely!

284
00:23:50,616 --> 00:23:51,586
Yeah.

285
00:23:51,586 --> 00:23:53,476
 Where are you? 

286
00:23:55,076 --> 00:23:56,116
Go in now.

287
00:23:56,116 --> 00:23:59,086
Ms. Yeon Seo, this is Ji Kang Woo. I'm in front of your house now. I'm coming in.

288
00:23:59,086 --> 00:24:00,856
Come, let's go in.

289
00:24:08,206 --> 00:24:12,066
Are you going to be okay for a long distance trip? This is the first time for you to ride a car since the accident.

290
00:24:12,066 --> 00:24:16,546
Get a memorandum from employees who got fired today. Train the staff better.

291
00:24:16,546 --> 00:24:17,996
I am having a headache.

292
00:24:17,996 --> 00:24:24,056
That's how the world works. One person causes trouble and the other person has to clean the mess afterward.

293
00:24:24,056 --> 00:24:27,416
Do you still think I'm not in my right mind?

294
00:24:27,416 --> 00:24:29,966
 How can you just go in like that? 

295
00:24:29,966 --> 00:24:32,526
Who gave you the permission to—

296
00:24:32,526 --> 00:24:34,636
Miss.

297
00:24:34,636 --> 00:24:36,266
Who are you?

298
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:39,796
This is Superintendent Go Seong Min of the Paegong police station.

299
00:24:39,796 --> 00:24:41,516
Did you call the police for real?

300
00:24:41,516 --> 00:24:44,656
Ji  Kang Woo, why do you meddle in this matter?

301
00:24:44,656 --> 00:24:46,066
I told you clearly already.

302
00:24:46,066 --> 00:24:47,576
It's not reported in an official route.

303
00:24:47,576 --> 00:24:51,266
He came here because I specially requested it of him.

304
00:24:51,266 --> 00:24:52,756
Well, that's it for me.

305
00:24:52,756 --> 00:24:57,516
After he checks the scene, you can decide if you want a further investigation or not.

306
00:25:15,726 --> 00:25:18,496
Looking at how thoroughly the scene has been cleaned up.

307
00:25:18,496 --> 00:25:21,896
The culprit wants...

308
00:25:23,016 --> 00:25:25,456
...to hide something.

309
00:25:28,316 --> 00:25:30,666
How come there are so many of them.

310
00:25:37,626 --> 00:25:41,056
This is the activity log of the staff who worked at the time of the accident and the description of the accident scene.

311
00:25:41,056 --> 00:25:44,256
According to my investigation, it's nothing but an accident.

312
00:25:44,256 --> 00:25:46,696
It was done in the wrong way from the beginning.

313
00:25:46,696 --> 00:25:50,696
Because you believed what people said and remembered.

314
00:25:50,696 --> 00:25:53,186
If you report it, I'll investigate the case.

315
00:25:53,186 --> 00:25:59,596
But since there's no CCTV footage and the evidence is gone from the scene of the crime, it will be difficult to catch the culprit.

316
00:25:59,596 --> 00:26:01,226
Okay.

317
00:26:02,456 --> 00:26:04,266
Thank you.

318
00:26:04,266 --> 00:26:06,386
We'll contact you at another time.

319
00:26:11,096 --> 00:26:14,086
Then, I'll be going now. Good day.

320
00:26:22,366 --> 00:26:25,186
Why haven't you left yet?

321
00:26:25,186 --> 00:26:27,756
I have something to talk to you about. Can you give me just one hour of your time?

322
00:26:27,756 --> 00:26:31,066
I'm on my way out right now. I have somewhere to go.

323
00:26:31,066 --> 00:26:33,496
Now? Where to?

324
00:26:33,496 --> 00:26:35,296
Bring the car around.

325
00:26:35,296 --> 00:26:37,046
You can't even spare just 30 minutes?

326
00:26:37,046 --> 00:26:38,376
I'm already late as it is.

327
00:26:38,376 --> 00:26:43,636
Thanks to a certain ill-mannered someone unnecessarily bringing a detective to my home, I've already wasted time.

328
00:26:46,846 --> 00:26:49,396
Why are you just standing there?

329
00:26:49,396 --> 00:26:51,336
I...

330
00:26:53,046 --> 00:26:56,316
can't drive.

331
00:27:02,696 --> 00:27:05,326
Out of all those employees you have, none of them know how to drive?

332
00:27:05,326 --> 00:27:06,686
We could have just taken a taxi. Why did we have to—

333
00:27:06,686 --> 00:27:09,916
You're complaining a lot for someone who doesn't have a license.

334
00:27:11,186 --> 00:27:12,556
And why do I have to sit here!

335
00:27:12,556 --> 00:27:15,366
You were the one that said I couldn't sit in the passenger seat!

336
00:27:15,366 --> 00:27:19,576
Pardon me, you two. If you wouldn't mind toning it down, I'm trying to drive here.

337
00:27:19,576 --> 00:27:25,226
♫  These little feelings, I suppose. Oh, I'm in love with  ♫

338
00:28:03,466 --> 00:28:04,806
   

339
00:28:04,806 --> 00:28:09,496
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

340
00:28:09,496 --> 00:28:12,426
Did you get to meet with Mr. Jo?

341
00:28:14,616 --> 00:28:19,956
I'm... I'm...

342
00:28:21,326 --> 00:28:23,536
I don't know.

343
00:28:24,656 --> 00:28:28,126
I can see, but now I can't walk.

344
00:28:28,126 --> 00:28:35,266
I always feel like people are watching me like a target that they're waiting to strike. I wish that feeling could be just a delusion.

345
00:28:36,466 --> 00:28:41,236
Mr. Jo, why is it that

346
00:28:41,236 --> 00:28:45,336
we only realize something is the last once it's already passed?

347
00:28:47,406 --> 00:28:50,886
I feel like I'm going mad every time the sun sets.

348
00:28:52,296 --> 00:28:55,486
When you told me the sunset was beautiful,

349
00:28:55,486 --> 00:29:00,566
"Is that so? What's it look like?"

350
00:29:00,566 --> 00:29:04,166
"Actually, I really want to see it, too."

351
00:29:04,166 --> 00:29:09,496
"I'm living in this world through the descriptions you give of it for me."

352
00:29:13,516 --> 00:29:16,026
I would have said all that.

353
00:29:22,126 --> 00:29:24,596
You're all so mean...

354
00:29:25,596 --> 00:29:28,256
For leaving just me here by myself.

355
00:29:31,666 --> 00:29:38,616
