1
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,128
Ms. Lee.

2
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:51,634
Can't you just give up on everything?

3
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:55,764
I hate to see you suffer.

4
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,641
You don't have to keep dancing

5
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,311
for Fantasia.

6
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:06,232
If you need an audience to dance,

7
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:08,985
I will watch you.

8
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:11,988
Okay?

9
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:14,991
Should I?

10
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,703
Should I give up on everything,

11
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,039
only show my dance to you,

12
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:23,124
and live forever with you?

13
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:31,841
Dan.

14
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:34,761
Yes, Ms. Lee.

15
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:39,974
Why do you always save me?

16
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:45,730
You save me

17
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,525
and help me out.

18
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,361
But why don't you like me?

19
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,074
Figures.

20
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:59,244
No one in this world likes me.

21
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,831
I don't care about that.

22
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:05,959
But

23
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,545
it's not okay for you

24
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:12,382
to not like me.

25
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:13,883
I hate it.

26
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:15,718
It's frustrating.

27
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,430
You said I'm good.

28
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,308
You said I'm pretty.

29
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,270
But...

30
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,941
But why don't you like me?

31
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,402
How can you not like me?

32
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,156
How?

33
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:38,908
Dan.

34
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:34,797
I

35
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,843
cannot like you.

36
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,304
And I

37
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:46,517
can't stay by your side forever.

38
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:48,478
That really

39
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,022
breaks my heart.

40
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,107
Yeon-seo.

41
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,235
How can I

42
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,406
not like you?

43
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:21,970
Don't go.

44
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,432
Don't go.

45
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,151
How do you really feel?

46
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:40,530
Are you worried he isn't the real one?

47
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,490
Or are you wishing
that he isn't the real one?

48
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,126
I'm in huge trouble, aren't I?

49
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,799
-What are you doing?
-No, what's with you?

50
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,803
-Let go of me. Let go--
-You can't run away.

51
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:06,597
Tell me you'll disappear
from Yeon-seo's life now.

52
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:07,724
What are you talking about?

53
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:08,891
I warned you, didn't I?

54
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,810
That I won't let you live
if you interfere.

55
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:14,605
Who do you think you are to tell her
to give up on dancing?

56
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,525
I said, let go!

57
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,335
I'm not really sure anymore.

58
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:37,879
I thought I'd be able to understand

59
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:40,631
what humans are like
when I take on their body.

60
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,508
But I guess not.

61
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:47,388
Why are humans like this?

62
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,349
When I like someone,
why does my heart ache?

63
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,852
I know it's a vain hope,

64
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,023
but why do I keep wanting
and wishing for more?

65
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:00,777
Why do

66
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:02,862
humans love

67
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,198
in such a foolish way?

68
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,031
You're awake.

69
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,451
He has a laceration on his arm.

70
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,539
Don't worry. It's not bad.

71
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:57,125
Ji Kang-woo. Where's Kang-woo?

72
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,169
The guy I fell in with. Is he not out yet?

73
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,673
There's another man in the water.
Keep searching.

74
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:04,799
Be quick.

75
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,634
He's human and could die...

76
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,513
We'll look for the other person.

77
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:11,889
Let's take you to the hospital.

78
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,892
That person. Is it...

79
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:19,355
Who do you mean?

80
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,653
Will you keep still?

81
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,241
I'm okay. I'm perfectly fine.

82
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:31,534
You bled a lot.

83
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,245
And just in case, we'll take an x-ray.

84
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:36,414
I'll heal right away. I swear.

85
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:40,376
Stay right here until it's your turn.

86
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,685
What's that I keep seeing?

87
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,814
It's not a dream or a prophecy.

88
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,321
It must have been Ji Kang-woo.

89
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:10,990
I hope he's okay.

90
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:18,080
So why did he lunge at me
and grab me by the throat?

91
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,500
Why would a civilized person do that?

92
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,170
Did he...

93
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,007
Can't you just give up on everything?

94
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,343
Should I give up on everything,

95
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:33,804
only show my dance to you,
and live forever with you?

96
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:36,432
Did he hear that?

97
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:39,769
If he did,

98
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:42,271
does that justify what he did?

99
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,439
It does.

100
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,987
Telling a dancer to quit
is like taking their life.

101
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,574
-What do you mean?
-After Yeon-seo went blind,

102
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,535
do you know she tried to kill herself?

103
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:00,164
She just got her sight back
and decided to dance again,

104
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,583
and you want her to give up? To quit?

105
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,043
How dare you?

106
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:06,379
Who do you think you are
to say such nonsense?

107
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,630
Quit your daydreaming.

108
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:08,714
Yeon-seo's standing

109
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:10,550
at the edge of a cliff.

110
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,094
Just one step
and she plummets into the darkness.

111
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:14,303
Don't push her!

112
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,015
That will be hell to her.

113
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,271
I'm warning you for the last time.

114
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,106
Resign and disappear tomorrow.

115
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,024
If not, I will

116
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,902
toss you into hell first.

117
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:42,123
Mr. Ji.

118
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,543
I won't disappear. I can't yet.

119
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,045
Why not? You pretended like it wasn't,

120
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,131
but is it because of your meager emotions?

121
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:51,841
Your sincerity and all that?

122
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:54,719
You're right.

123
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,387
I like Yeon-seo.

124
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:57,847
I like her.

125
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,683
Much more than I thought.

126
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,936
That's why I'm doing this.
Because I want to see her happy.

127
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,855
You promised me that whatever you do,

128
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:08,691
you'll do it to make Yeon-seo happy.

129
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:10,818
Keep your word.

130
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:12,111
If you do that,

131
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:14,488
I'll disappear.

132
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:16,949
I won't look back

133
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,285
and will leave with a smile.

134
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,495
But if you

135
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:24,332
give her a hard time
over dance or anything,

136
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,084
then I will make you pay.

137
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,004
Do you understand?

138
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,576
I know better than anyone.
I won't do anything.

139
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,662
I won't yearn for more.

140
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,997
Kim Dan, it's time for your x-ray.

141
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:06,707
What are you doing?

142
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,876
I'm fine now. I'll get going.

143
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:10,670
-Wait.
-Sorry.

144
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,255
Wait.

145
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:14,465
Kim Dan.

146
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,300
Oh, dear Deity.

147
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,136
He is out of his mind.

148
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,348
Please ignore

149
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:24,433
all the confessions from today.

150
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:57,174
Seol-hui.

151
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:15,234
Why am I

152
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,529
like this, Seol-hui?

153
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,282
I thought it's almost done,

154
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,951
and that I'm almost there.

155
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,246
He really gets on my nerves.

156
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,583
I can't stand him.

157
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:34,920
Is it really him

158
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,298
that's getting on your nerves?

159
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,218
What's making you waver?

160
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,096
Is it that man

161
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:45,514
or

162
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,641
is it your heart?

163
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:05,784
Where's Ni-na?

164
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,287
Just one glass should do it.

165
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:10,498
Ru-na.

166
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:13,125
Shall we talk?

167
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:14,710
About what?

168
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,505
It's nothing.

169
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:21,217
Call the sponsors' association
and have them gather by 9 a.m.

170
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,177
-Now?
-Yes.

171
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:26,472
-Good morning.
-Morning.

172
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,519
Did you drink?

173
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,105
Do you smell it? Oh, dear.

174
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,066
I showered two times
and brushed my teeth three times.

175
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,109
You never drank alcohol. Why start now?

176
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:41,654
Is it because of Yeon-seo?

177
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,239
You boycotted her.

178
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,865
The corps are all in,

179
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,492
but the Artistic Director
is being stubborn.

180
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,369
Drink this. You'll feel better.

181
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:55,000
It will all work out.
Trust me and rest today.

182
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,002
Okay.

183
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,219
Mom.

184
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,972
Do you remember the instructor
who first taught me ballet?

185
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,598
Who do you mean?

186
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:13,310
You know, there was
this instructor called Ms. Elena.

187
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:14,812
That lunatic?

188
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,230
Why are you suddenly asking about her?

189
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,940
She got kicked out long ago.

190
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,693
It's just that now Yeon-seo's back,

191
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,278
and I was reminded of her.

192
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,946
She's no longer an instructor.

193
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,282
She threw red paint
at an eight-year-old girl,

194
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,117
telling her to imagine death.

195
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,911
And she dunked you in a bathtub
so you could imagine the sea.

196
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,706
My goodness.
She was completely out of her mind.

197
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,040
Ni-na.

198
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,251
If someone asks,
you say you don't know her.

199
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,795
She never taught you
and you don't know her.

200
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:43,549
Nothing good will come from
you being associated with her.

201
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,370
I'll give you 12 hours.
Resign on your own.

202
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,623
Telling a dancer to quit

203
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:17,583
is like taking their life.

204
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,012
How long were you standing there?

205
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:36,810
For a while.

206
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,481
You're pretty.
You're always pretty when you dance.

207
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,524
You are.

208
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,026
That's a given.

209
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,445
Do I

210
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,322
have about two hours left?

211
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,574
About what your aunt said yesterday?

212
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,702
-That's--
-Ms. Lee.

213
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,999
Take it. It's the result
of the blood test.

214
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,001
Didn't you say it's of no use?

215
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,044
Did you find anything?

216
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,003
No.

217
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:06,548
If you're cornered, use this to bluff.

218
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,884
That someone set you up
and you're a victim.

219
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,844
If they push you,
you'll reveal the results.

220
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,972
No. Just...

221
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:14,473
Don't go.

222
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,934
The 12-hour deadline
was unfair from the start.

223
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:20,229
You have no duty or responsibility
to go by what they said.

224
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,313
And if I don't go,

225
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,399
should I just give in?

226
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:26,110
You know that General Director Choi

227
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:27,903
is no pushover.

228
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,615
I know that. I know too well
which is why I'm like this.

229
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,409
It's obvious what'll happen.

230
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,370
She'll nag at you to no end
and force you to quit.

231
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,045
My goodness.
She knew we were talking about her.

232
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,005
CHOI YEONG-JA

233
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,089
What do we do?

234
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,258
Let me answer it.
She probably wants to talk to me.

235
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,388
Yes, it's me.

236
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,515
Why aren't you answering my calls?

237
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:57,558
I almost thought that

238
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,935
you went into hiding
because you were scared.

239
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,438
Hello? Are you there?

240
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:03,689
Go on.

241
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,107
Your time is almost up.

242
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:06,692
Are you coming or not?

243
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:10,362
Everyone from the association
is going to be there.

244
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,448
If you're not joining us,
I'll speak on your behalf.

245
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,283
I'll tell them
you'll take full responsibility--

246
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,368
Just wait. I'll be there on time.

247
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,205
You've made the right decision.

248
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,000
People say ending things
on a good note is all that matters.

249
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:26,003
It's much better that it will be you
who will put an end to this mess

250
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,254
without anyone's involvement.

251
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:28,797
See you later then.

252
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:31,967
What did she say?

253
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:33,594
I must get going.

254
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,140
If things go south,
just pretend to faint. Okay?

255
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,020
Dan.

256
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,565
Why are you so quiet?

257
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,650
Aren't you going to ask

258
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,486
what I'm going to do?

259
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,909
Hey, where are you going?

260
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,203
Dan!

261
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:10,839
Why are we

262
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:12,591
here?

263
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,896
Hey, what are you doing?

264
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:29,483
How did it feel
when you fell into the water?

265
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,323
Wasn't it dark,

266
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:37,991
suffocating,

267
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:39,827
scary,

268
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,078
and lonely?

269
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,206
I know that too.

270
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,796
Have you gone mad? What were you thinking?

271
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:52,673
You almost gave me a heart attack!

272
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,716
It's really unfortunate.

273
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:58,053
Had I known you at the time,

274
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:00,973
I would've stopped you

275
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:04,977
like you held my hand just now.

276
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:09,523
Actually, yesterday,

277
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,733
this is what I told you.

278
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:13,944
I told you if it's too hard,

279
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,529
you can give up.

280
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,158
-I don't remember that.
-I did tell you that.

281
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,076
I told you to give up
and have an easy life.

282
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:24,079
But that day at the beach

283
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,832
and in your studio this morning,

284
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:29,960
you were happy

285
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:33,881
for sure.

286
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:36,884
If you like dancing,

287
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:38,510
go ahead.

288
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,470
And just keep this in mind.

289
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,307
Whatever you decide to do

290
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:44,975
or wherever you are,

291
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,019
you are no longer alone.

292
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,902
We'll be late. Let's hurry.

293
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,116
Wait up for me!

294
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,043
The sponsors' association is meeting now?

295
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,711
Everyone is in the conference room now.

296
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,463
General Director Choi called the meeting.

297
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,256
I thought that you should be informed too.

298
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,887
SPONSORS' ASSOCIATION CHAIRMAN
LEE YONG-JIN

299
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,097
Thank you.

300
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,683
What on earth is going there?

301
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,978
Yesterday, you barged into my car
and threatened me.

302
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,150
It seems like you do business
with Mr. Ishikawa.

303
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,861
Would you like to pay taxes
in both countries?

304
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,196
What do you want?

305
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,240
Maintaining the status quo.

306
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,367
No more, no less.

307
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,453
And today, General Director Choi
called me at the crack of dawn.

308
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,664
Because Lee Yeon-seo will make
an important announcement.

309
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,374
What did you say?

310
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:53,919
What are you doing?

311
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:55,921
Is this some kind of a prank?

312
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:58,632
We will submit an official petition
to dismiss you.

313
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,884
Ms. Lee Yeon-seo.

314
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,053
You and I went over this together.

315
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:05,973
If you keep this up,
you're going to ruin Fantasia.

316
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:26,493
I'm sorry.

317
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,418
I take responsibility

318
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,503
for what happened that day.

319
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:39,172
I won't make any excuses.

320
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,341
I apologize.

321
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,265
Go on. What else?

322
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:52,227
Do you think that
just saying sorry is enough?

323
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,228
Are you serious?

324
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:54,855
There's more.

325
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,567
Ms. Lee Yeon-seo, don't be nervous.
Just speak your mind.

326
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,820
Do you remember
what we promised yesterday?

327
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,698
Do you remember what we were going to do

328
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:06,992
for the future of Fantasia?

329
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,293
I know it's difficult.

330
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:23,216
Starting today, Ms. Lee Yeon-seo
decided to resign

331
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,218
from the foundation
and the ballet theater.

332
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,179
No. I won't do that.

333
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:29,389
That's not true.

334
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:32,350
Are you telling us that you won't resign
from both of your positions?

335
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,269
Are you truly sorry?

336
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:36,021
I will show you with my performance.

337
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:38,106
I'm sure you've suspected me
since that day.

338
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,608
I will show you

339
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,193
that I'm not mentally unstable

340
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:42,986
and that I'm perfectly sane.

341
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:48,867
This all has to be worth something.

342
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,244
It must be worthy of our money
which we earned

343
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:52,871
with our blood and sweat.

344
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:54,873
If you're going to apologize,

345
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,584
you can kneel down
and put everything to rest.

346
00:22:58,251 --> 00:22:59,795
It's clear and sincere.

347
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:02,255
I see.

348
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,299
Kneel down?

349
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:07,010
Sincere?

350
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:09,930
That's it.

351
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:32,619
Do you like ballet?

352
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,288
What's your favorite show?

353
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,998
What's your favorite role?

354
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:40,377
Do you know how many dancers
we have in our ballet theater?

355
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:43,421
You were in the middle of your apology.

356
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,465
What nonsense are you gibbering about?

357
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:46,758
You don't like ballet.

358
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,219
Right?

359
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:54,057
There are people like this
in the association.

360
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:57,352
They are ignorant,
but they want to look sophisticated

361
00:23:57,435 --> 00:23:59,646
and believe that
they can buy taste with money.

362
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,483
They sit in the best seat

363
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,068
and doze off.

364
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,487
Those annoying snobs.

365
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,323
-What did she just say?
-What?

366
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,491
Lee Yeon-seo!

367
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:15,078
Were you just talking about us?

368
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,621
I'll make you like it.

369
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,082
Ballet.

370
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,626
I'll make you love it. I'll do that.

371
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:24,671
That will be worth your money.

372
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,382
If this show, Giselle,

373
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,968
isn't a success, I will resign

374
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,971
from the ballet theater
and Fantasia Cultural Foundation.

375
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:36,057
Is this answer satisfying enough for you?

376
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:37,601
We will extend General Director Choi's

377
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,269
power of attorney
until the day of the show.

378
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:40,270
After the show,

379
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:42,939
we'll choose
which one of us will leave Fantasia.

380
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,443
This is all. Bye.

381
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:50,030
My goodness.

382
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,241
-Gosh.
-She's unbelievable.

383
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:14,554
Ms. Lee.

384
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:21,686
Good job.

385
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:25,232
Let's come up with the best show
and make them kneel down.

386
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:27,525
I'll do my best.

387
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,444
Lee Yeon-seo.

388
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,323
Let's talk.

389
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:42,958
You...

390
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,085
Are you toying with me?

391
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:46,586
Do you think I'm a joke?

392
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,172
How could you con me every chance you get?

393
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:50,590
How did we

394
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,634
get here?

395
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,056
Because of this?

396
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,309
Do you want it?

397
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,312
Don't patronize me.

398
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:05,981
You think I'm greedy for money?

399
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:10,610
If I was greedy for money,
I would've sold this off ages ago

400
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,697
while you were away in Russia
and when you were blind.

401
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:16,908
I am the one who made Fantasia
what it is today.

402
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:19,869
It was me who worked for a decade to bring

403
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:23,206
Fantasia to where it is now
after your parents passed away.

404
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:27,252
I had to flatter those ministers
and play nice with the sponsors.

405
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:29,296
And it was me
who built this foundation up.

406
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:31,589
How does this belong to you
when I did all the hard work?

407
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,094
Since when
did you start to covet Fantasia?

408
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:39,264
Was it when my father took you
and your husband in

409
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:40,640
because you had nowhere else to go?

410
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,142
Or was it when my parents passed away?

411
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:44,269
Did you think it'd be easy
since it was just me?

412
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,645
Did you begin to get greedy?

413
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,399
Stop denouncing me.

414
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,109
You don't even know anything.

415
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:52,193
If that's not it,

416
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:54,404
did you get delusional
and begin to think that it's yours

417
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:57,073
because the only successor was blind?

418
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:58,366
Did you ever

419
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:02,329
feel bad about me as your family,

420
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:04,414
even once?

421
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:13,089
If you didn't do something like this,

422
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,258
today, I would have...

423
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:17,719
No.

424
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,306
I would have put everything down ages ago.

425
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:24,351
You're using me as an excuse
to the very end.

426
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,520
I'll also show you
that I am worthy of this.

427
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:34,277
Fine, I look forward
to seeing your Giselle.

428
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:37,697
Although you won't have
corps de ballet or a partner.

429
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,210
How is your arm?

430
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,381
Well, I'm fine now.

431
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,550
So when will you quit?

432
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:00,345
You saw her. No matter what they say,

433
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:02,555
she told them she will make them
fall in love with ballet.

434
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:04,516
That's what a ballerina is.

435
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,685
Someone who stands by herself
on the huge stage.

436
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:10,563
She doesn't need a cheeky secretary.

437
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:16,444
In that aspect, you didn't
really do anything either.

438
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:20,990
Yeon-seo resolved this all alone.

439
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:24,536
I couldn't tell you before
because I was out of it,

440
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,663
but hell is not somewhere you can just go

441
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:29,249
because somebody sends you there.

442
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:31,376
I can't explain this in detail,

443
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:33,795
but especially someone like me
can't go to that place.

444
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:35,672
Keep that in your mind.

445
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,591
Where are the corps?

446
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,094
I know they're on a strike.

447
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,554
I'll go talk to them.

448
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:43,722
That's not necessary.

449
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:46,808
They aren't striking against you,
Yeon-seo.

450
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:49,352
It's a strike against the decision
I made as their director.

451
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,353
I'll take care of this.

452
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:53,231
It's because of me. So I'll go and--

453
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,442
HWANG JEONG-EUN, FANTASIA

454
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,782
This is Ji Kang-woo.
Where are you right now?

455
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:05,368
Let us tell you what our demand is.

456
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:09,497
First.

457
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,625
Retract your decision
in making Lee Yeon-seo our lead.

458
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:13,543
Second.

459
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,004
Please put an end
to your dogmatic leadership.

460
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,423
Is that all?
I will answer you immediately.

461
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:20,216
First, I will not retract anything.

462
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,217
Second,

463
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,970
if you do not show up at the practice
at 10 a.m. tomorrow, you will be fired.

464
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:28,600
-Director Ji.
-We can just get new dancers.

465
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:31,853
People even line up to join our theater
as a member of a group dance.

466
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,730
I do not wish to create a performance

467
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:36,941
with a demanding corps
that does not trust me as their director.

468
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:39,652
Tomorrow at 10 a.m. It's the last chance
I am giving you as a director.

469
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:40,737
That's all.

470
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,323
What did he say?

471
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:45,909
-What if I get fired?
-Do we have to go?

472
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:50,455
What were you thinking?

473
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:53,792
I'm giving them an opportunity.
They can use this as an excuse to return.

474
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:56,753
How can I perform with people
who return reluctantly?

475
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,255
I know you're trying very hard
for my sake.

476
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:01,424
Even so, this isn't right.

477
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:02,634
What do you expect me to do?

478
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:05,303
You can do things your way.

479
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,430
I'll try my best too.

480
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:09,641
Let's go.

481
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:19,859
It is said that those who oppress the
righteous person and deprive the poor

482
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:23,530
have many faults and great sins.

483
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:34,791
Should I give Ni-na a call?

484
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:45,510
Ni-na is a great person,
so she'll help you out.

485
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,723
KEUM NI-NA

486
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:57,814
Yes, Dan. What is it?

487
00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:59,107
It's me, Yeon-seo.

488
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:03,987
If you're calling
about the ballet theater,

489
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,530
I can't tell you anything.

490
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,407
I'm not asking you to persuade them.

491
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:10,326
Just tell me where you are.

492
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:11,995
Please.

493
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,876
I've never asked you for a favor before.

494
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,879
Please don't put me
in a tight spot. I'm hanging up.

495
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,922
I thought you wanted to fight
fair and square.

496
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,551
You came to my house and told me

497
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:29,387
to return to my old self
because you wanted to compete with me.

498
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,890
If you push me away even before we begin,

499
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:33,808
how could we ever know who won?

500
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,103
What are we going to do?

501
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,939
Director Ji always does whatever he says.

502
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:42,358
Can we just stay here
and do volunteer work?

503
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,611
Hey, can't you tell that
he's throwing a bait

504
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:45,862
to have some of us return?

505
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:48,156
If we just sit around on a strike,
it'll only make us feel bad.

506
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,116
But if we do charity work,
we'll get good energy.

507
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:51,409
Let's hold out.

508
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,495
Ni-na, any ideas?

509
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,998
What do you think about
having a talk with them?

510
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:59,542
We need to talk to them to negotiate.

511
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:02,462
Are we going to go there obediently
after he gave us an ultimatum?

512
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,714
That's as good as saying that we give up.

513
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:07,675
Goodness, I'm sorry

514
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:11,971
How did you find us?

515
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,514
I came to do volunteer work.

516
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:16,768
I'm a part of Fantasia Ballet Theater.

517
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:34,118
Stop putting on a show and go.
Since when did you do things with us?

518
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:37,664
Starting now.

519
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:39,916
I want to do things
as a member of the corps.

520
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:42,710
Who says you can?

521
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,671
Hey, just let her do it.

522
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,965
The more help we have, the better.

523
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:50,134
I assure you
that she'll leave crying in an hour.

524
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,567
I feel so good.

525
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:08,277
This is refreshing.

526
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,117
Do you like it?

527
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:28,297
All right, here comes Lee Yeon-seo!
It's Lee Yeon-seo!

528
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,940
Let's dance among ourselves!

529
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:04,042
-Ms. Lee.
-Not a word.

530
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:05,334
I'm tired.

531
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,598
Ms. Lee, congratulations!

532
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:22,727
I heard you put the sponsors'
association in their place today.

533
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,228
People say that everything has its use,

534
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:25,980
and that was a great way
to use your temper.

535
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,316
Come on, blow them out. Make a wish too.

536
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,611
Giselle will do awesome!
Lee Yeon-seo, you'll do even better!

537
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:33,196
In one, two, three.

538
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:37,283
What was that?

539
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,786
The ballet theater is on a strike.

540
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,829
So she's feeling the worst right now.

541
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:46,834
Why are you telling me this now?
You should have told me before.

542
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,961
I was really out of it this afternoon too.

543
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:51,339
What is this? I must have looked clueless.

544
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,815
You don't know where the corps is?

545
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,858
I will report back before lunch.

546
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:12,318
No, there is no need to do that.

547
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:13,694
Make an audition announcement

548
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:16,280
-for new members now.
-Director Ji.

549
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:18,699
Make sure the résumé screenings
and the interviews happen soon.

550
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:20,868
What are we going to do?

551
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,245
It's 10 a.m.

552
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,372
Can we do this?

553
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:27,041
What if we really get fired?

554
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,627
We took a stand. Let's push ahead.

555
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:34,590
Ni-na's on our side.
They wouldn't fire us all.

556
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,884
Good morning, everyone.

557
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,346
Good morning.

558
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,348
Hello.

559
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:44,684
Hello. Good morning.

560
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,898
Where are you?

561
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:54,569
My husband. Where is he?
Where did my husband go?

562
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:57,321
He must've left without me.

563
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,615
He left me all alone.

564
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,993
Ma'am, I'll hold your hand.

565
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:03,703
Take my hand and calm...

566
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,206
No, no.

567
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,333
She lost her mind again.

568
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,585
Sir!

569
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:12,086
Take me with you.

570
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,339
I can't live in a world without you.

571
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:18,009
Don't do this, ma'am. Calm down.

572
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:19,385
Mi-ok.

573
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:25,516
Mi-ok.

574
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,559
Mi-ok.

575
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:28,936
I'm here. It's okay.

576
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:31,731
It's okay now.

577
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,035
We must get out of here.

578
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,043
Let's go.

579
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,462
Get them out of here.

580
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:04,013
Help everyone out of here.

581
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,473
Hurry. Let's get outside.

582
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,102
Take your time.

583
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:13,272
Sit down here.

584
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,901
What happened?

585
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:19,028
This old lady...

586
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,239
I did it.

587
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:23,532
I did it.

588
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,412
Are you okay?

589
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:34,252
Leave. Before we get kicked out
because of you.

590
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,503
I apologize.

591
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,255
I meant well.

592
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,882
One more show of goodwill
and you'll burn down the building.

593
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,385
I just

594
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,972
wanted to show you that I'm sincere.

595
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,306
Sincere about what?

596
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:51,394
You being the lead
while we make you look good?

597
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:53,271
If the princess volunteers with us,

598
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:55,856
did you think
we'd be touched by your efforts

599
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,401
and shed tears with you
and come back to the stage?

600
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:02,738
Yeon-seo. No one wants to remain
a backup dancer forever.

601
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,865
That's right. This isn't a joke.

602
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:06,367
You regained your sight long ago

603
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,202
but this is the first time
you came to see us.

604
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,704
Because you need us.

605
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:16,711
Why did you lie?

606
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,587
You didn't start the fire.

607
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,549
Things could've gotten worse.

608
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,802
What if they decided to make her leave?

609
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,346
You got so nice.

610
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,767
I'm not nasty. I'm just impartial.

611
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:35,604
They'll understand your sincerity.

612
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:38,274
Because

613
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,360
they all love to dance as well.

614
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:44,447
I watched them clean up

615
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,449
and they were all dancing.

616
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:50,828
It was a nice sight.
They all looked like leads.

617
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:53,414
Do you think

618
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:57,793
they don't understand why you want
to dance again after three years?

619
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:01,505
They're shutting you out now
because they're upset and hurt,

620
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,382
but if you perform together,

621
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,469
I bet it'll be a great sight.

622
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,059
A lead?

623
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:48,928
Ki-chun?

624
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:50,805
Gwang-il.

625
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:54,517
Why are you here?

626
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,684
What about you?

627
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:57,895
Are you here to see Ms. Lee?

628
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,898
I don't have an appointment but...

629
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,404
Let me see.

630
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:09,740
Gwang-il. Hey, Gwang-il.

631
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,368
-Gwang-il.
-Don't follow me.

632
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:15,287
-Gwang-il.
-He should've rung the bell.

633
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,290
What's he doing outside
someone else's home?

634
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,710
-Hello.
-Hello.

635
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:28,634
Are you worried that
Yeon-seo might be here?

636
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:31,137
No.

637
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,264
She wouldn't come back
after what happened yesterday

638
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:35,266
if she has a conscience. Let's go.

639
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:38,436
The current time is 9:45 a.m.

640
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:43,482
My gosh, this is amazing.

641
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,235
I just pressed a button.

642
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:50,406
If you press this down and talk,

643
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:52,533
you can call your husband.

644
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,702
What did you save his number as?

645
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:58,205
"My old man." That's what I saved him as.

646
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:01,041
Then give it a go. Press this down

647
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,669
and say, "Call my old man."

648
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:06,547
Call my old man.

649
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:13,345
You're doing so well, Mi-ok.

650
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:20,227
Are we allowed to accept this?

651
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:23,939
You paid for the repairs
and took the blame for

652
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,483
the fire we caused.

653
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,319
I'm so sorry.

654
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:31,280
I should be dead and gone at my age,

655
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:33,324
but I'm not and I keep losing my mind.

656
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,159
No, ma'am.

657
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:37,953
You can do just fine even if you're blind.

658
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:39,747
I'll help you.

659
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:44,585
Yeon-seo.

660
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:52,635
Let's go. Director Ji is waiting.

661
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:55,179
Can you excuse us?

662
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:57,348
The director?

663
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:12,905
What is it?

664
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,241
Why did you call me here?

665
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,911
I want to propose something
to you all and Director Ji.

666
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:24,041
Giselle.

667
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:26,126
Let's hold an audition.

668
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:30,172
I sincerely

669
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:33,217
want to work with you all.

670
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:36,637
You kept Fantasia going
for the past three years.

671
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:39,807
The new corps isn't Fantasia to me.

672
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:42,518
Let's compete

673
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,436
officially and fair.

674
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:47,773
From soloist to corps de ballet,
everyone can participate.

675
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:50,359
Of course, I get the right as well.

676
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:53,571
If I don't pass,
I'll start from the corps de ballet.

677
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,333
Who says there can be an audition?

678
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,043
I don't want a free ride.

679
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:09,628
This is the best way.

680
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,630
To me, there's only one Giselle.

681
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:14,633
There's no need to make things harder.

682
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:18,053
I said I'd sort it out.
Why don't you trust me?

683
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:19,763
Thank you for believing in me.

684
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,183
Even when I didn't believe myself,

685
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:25,019
you pushed your way in

686
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:26,604
and made me dance.

687
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:29,815
Trust me again.

688
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:31,900
It might be an endless tunnel,

689
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:33,819
but it'll be easier together.

690
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:45,039
How about a group cheer?

691
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:47,124
Fantasia, Fantasia, let's do this!

692
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:13,984
Hello?

693
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:15,861
Ms. Elena

694
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:31,418
Ms. Elena

695
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:32,753
Darn it.

696
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,298
I need you.

697
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:38,634
Ms. Elena

698
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:49,353
Teach me.

699
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:54,149
Teach me.

700
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:05,577
Teach me.

701
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:07,413
You can't take that all!

702
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:11,250
Ms. Elena, teach me.

703
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:13,752
Teach me.

704
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:17,214
Ms. Elena.

705
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:19,508
Ms. Elena, will you teach me?

706
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,553
Get out! I told you to pay for that!

707
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:26,557
Hey, hey!

708
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:30,144
-No, no.
-Let go!

709
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:45,701
You dropped this.

710
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:47,494
I picked it up.

711
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:50,956
You don't do this kind of stuff.

712
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:53,417
Are you saying

713
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:54,835
I'm a kind, softhearted,

714
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:57,212
and boring girl
who always follows the rules?

715
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:58,213
You know it well.

716
00:45:58,297 --> 00:45:59,590
You're boring and no fun.

717
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:01,967
I'm going to throw away that side of me.

718
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:04,386
That's why I need you.

719
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:07,347
Please make me a new ballerina.

720
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,558
You've been living like
a softy for 26 years.

721
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,185
Why all of a sudden?

722
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:12,227
I want to

723
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:14,771
beat Yeon-seo.

724
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:17,733
I'll do whatever it takes.

725
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:20,277
I'll beat her no matter what.

726
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:11,245
Which one should I get?

727
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:12,871
These cucumbers look fresh.

728
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:17,084
My gosh, what's all this?

729
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:19,169
Are you going to cook
a meal for your girlfriend?

730
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:20,712
No, she's not my girlfriend.

731
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:21,964
Then is it for your wife?

732
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:24,049
My gosh. She's not my wife.

733
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:27,803
Well, she's not
my girlfriend, wife, or anything.

734
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,641
If she's not anything,
what are you doing here?

735
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:36,853
Why didn't you write your report?

736
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:50,409
You scared me!

737
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,419
Have you given up on everything?

738
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:01,878
Where's your report?

739
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:04,590
Why are you doing this? Why?

740
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:06,883
This girl has a hard life. What can I do?

741
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:08,635
I see her having a problem
after a problem.

742
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:11,680
When will she date and fall in love?

743
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:13,307
She needs to take care of
her problems first.

744
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:16,143
Right. Two months.

745
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:19,021
You think you have all the time
in the world, don't you?

746
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:22,816
Hu, here's my big picture.

747
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:25,402
Once she's free of problems
and has time to look after herself,

748
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:27,779
she's bound to fall in love with somebody.

749
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:29,156
I haven't given up yet.

750
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:33,327
You really know nothing about humans.

751
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:37,664
Nobody in this world falls in love
after getting everything perfectly ready.

752
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:38,665
If that's the case,

753
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:41,126
why do you think all those old fables
have such tragic storylines?

754
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:44,796
Anyway,

755
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:47,758
I'm going to focus on Yeon-seo's
happiness for the time being.

756
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,302
I'll submit all the reports
I'm behind at once.

757
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:54,431
Gosh.

758
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:57,684
My goodness.

759
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:38,100
It is said that those who oppress
the righteous person and deprive the poor

760
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:41,687
have many faults and great sins.

761
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,105
Hell is somewhere you can just go

762
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:45,232
because somebody sends you there.

763
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,150
I can't explain this in detail,

764
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:49,695
but especially someone like me
can't go to that place.

765
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:51,196
I haven't given up yet.

766
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:53,532
I'll submit all the reports
I'm behind at once.

767
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:15,178
Believe in the mercy of the deity.

768
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:18,390
And confess all of the sins
you have committed so far.

769
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:21,768
Father, do angels exist?

770
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:28,525
I'm sure they are fulfilling their duties
in places where they can't be seen

771
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:30,777
as loyal servants of the deity.

772
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,237
What about an angel that can be seen?

773
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:34,781
I bet he violated religious precepts.

774
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:37,534
Angels can't be seen
in the eyes of humans.

775
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:38,744
What if someone did?

776
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:42,372
What happens to the angel
when a human finds out the true identity?

777
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:47,794
I believe you are mistaken, brother.

778
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:50,172
Father,

779
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:53,008
it sounds like you know
nothing about angels.

780
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:55,218
Or for some reason, you have to pretend

781
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:57,596
that you don't know.

782
00:50:57,679 --> 00:50:59,723
This is where you confess your sins.

783
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:01,558
You're not here to test me.

784
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:02,726
Please go back.

785
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:19,075
What is this about?

786
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:21,703
It's nothing. I'll see you around.

787
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:31,588
My gosh. Goodness.

788
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:40,597
Gosh.

789
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:42,015
What are you doing?

790
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:45,894
Well, the past couple of days
have been hard for you.

791
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:47,187
You barely ate.

792
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:49,147
I'm trying to cook you something.

793
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:50,857
But it's a mess.

794
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:55,237
Move.

795
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,281
Let me help.

796
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:00,283
Hold on.

797
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:04,246
-You should put this on.
-Forget it.

798
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:06,248
Hold on. Wait, wait.

799
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:08,667
You have to put this on.
Put your head down first.

800
00:52:10,335 --> 00:52:11,336
Come here.

801
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:14,005
Your arms.

802
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:18,260
Stay still.

803
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:24,015
Come on. Stop it. What a hassle.

804
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:26,226
You and your temper.

805
00:52:31,147 --> 00:52:33,567
Are you serious? You're a bad cook too.

806
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:41,366
What should I do?

807
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:43,285
Go wash them.

808
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:44,911
Do I wash everything? Not just two?

809
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:48,832
-Stop. I'm going to do it.
-Let me do it. No.

810
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:50,750
If you chop it like that, it's dangerous.

811
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:52,919
That's not how you do it.

812
00:52:57,799 --> 00:52:58,800
Like this.

813
00:53:00,176 --> 00:53:01,761
-Okay.
-This is how you chop a carrot.

814
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:03,430
Darn it.

815
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:06,725
I smell something burning.

816
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,184
Let me take care of that.

817
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,020
It's hot.

818
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:12,480
-Are you okay?
-Stay there!

819
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:14,774
Hold on a second.

820
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,704
You can't hurt your feet.

821
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:37,380
Ms. Lee.

822
00:53:38,256 --> 00:53:39,299
Should we

823
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:43,845
just have instant noodles?

824
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,358
Here.

825
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:25,387
No.

826
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:27,472
Goodness!

827
00:54:28,473 --> 00:54:29,474
Gosh, it's hot.

828
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:11,099
Hey, you over there!

829
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:12,851
Be careful!

830
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,200
Are you okay?

831
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:35,206
I'm Yeon-seo. Lee Yeon-seo.

832
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:36,583
What about you?

833
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:39,419
I'm...

834
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:49,054
I had another dream.

835
00:55:50,346 --> 00:55:51,973
What was that?

836
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:02,484
Hu!

837
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,281
Goodness.

838
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:15,663
Why? What is it?

839
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:19,876
Can a human become an angel?

840
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:21,461
-What?
-I mean,

841
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:25,048
they were probably a human,
and they probably died, right?

842
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:28,218
So do their souls
sometimes become an angel?

843
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:33,515
Why do you suddenly want to know
about the secrets of that realm?

844
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,811
I keep having a dream.
I see a little boy there.

845
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:40,688
He runs, falls down,
and even drowns in the sea,

846
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:42,398
but I haven't seen him anywhere,

847
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:43,733
not even in pictures.

848
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:45,860
He's not someone I passed by
when I was dispatched.

849
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:48,321
Then who in the world is he?

850
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:52,325
Oh, my deity.

851
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:59,916
This body has serious defects.

852
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:06,089
You're starting to dream
of what you wish for to happen.

853
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:08,133
What do I wish to happen?

854
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:09,217
When humans

855
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:10,552
have a wish,

856
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:13,221
they begin to ponder about it
over and over again.

857
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:15,140
Then their brain cells
begin to get confused.

858
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:17,475
Is this the future? The past?
Or just their desire?

859
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:19,144
It's just a side effect. Forget about it.

860
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:20,854
Humans dream of what they wish for?

861
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:22,147
Yes.

862
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:23,148
Hu.

863
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:27,569
Then am I wishing to become a human?

864
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:31,156
Does that ever happen?
An angel becoming a human?

865
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:36,911
Why did you hit me?

866
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:37,996
Follow me.

867
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:47,839
You always leave me hanging and
never explain the most important things.

868
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:50,717
Why are we here? This is a sanatorium.

869
00:57:51,676 --> 00:57:52,886
There he is.

870
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:54,554
It's very refreshing.

871
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:55,722
Isn't it?

872
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:58,600
Hello, sir!

873
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:06,316
No, we have to go. We must go.

874
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:10,487
We have to go. We have to go!

875
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:12,655
Come with me.

876
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:32,550
Angel Noel, receive your judgment.

877
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:38,097
He's an angel?

878
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:42,393
Please spare his life. Please.

879
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:49,067
You foolish one.

880
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:50,735
I do not care

881
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:53,696
if I disappear like this.

882
00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:55,949
But please

883
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:58,368
let her live.

884
00:58:58,952 --> 00:58:59,994
Death

885
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:02,664
is not a punishment.

886
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:06,042
How dare an angel who refused
to bring her to paradise

887
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:08,545
speak of life and death of a human?

888
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:17,136
Where are you?

889
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:18,930
Where are you?

890
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:20,598
Where are you?

891
00:59:28,147 --> 00:59:29,065
Then

892
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:33,736
at least let me say goodbye to her.

893
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:36,614
It will take only a minute.

894
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:50,378
I am right here. Right here.

895
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:54,173
Don't go. No, don't leave me.

896
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:57,176
You promised to stay with me.

897
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:00,138
I was here for a long time.

898
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:03,766
I was glad

899
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:07,395
to have met you.

900
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:10,815
I will not forget,

901
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:13,234
my dear Mi-ok.

902
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,665
-No.
-Move aside.

903
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:31,252
Just a little more.
Give them just a little more time.

904
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:18,841
Since you won't listen to me,
you left me no choice but to show you.

905
01:01:19,092 --> 01:01:22,345
You foolish one.
I hope you will be enlightened.

906
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:56,254
Ma'am.

907
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:58,381
Ma'am.

908
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:47,180
You're here.

909
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:50,683
Let's eat breakfast.
It's better than yesterday.

910
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,686
Where did you go out this early?

911
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:57,356
-Do you want water?
-Ms. Lee.

912
01:02:58,608 --> 01:02:59,776
I have something to tell you.

913
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:02,153
It's really important.

914
01:03:06,073 --> 01:03:07,533
-What is it?
-I...

915
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:10,745
want to quit my job.

916
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:13,748
I want to

917
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:16,125
move out.

918
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:48,282
Why Yeon-seo?

919
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:53,079
Why did you send me to her of all people?

920
01:03:53,412 --> 01:03:54,956
I want to stay with her.

921
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:57,583
I got angry and resented him too, but--

922
01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:59,126
Pull yourself together, will you?

923
01:04:00,419 --> 01:04:03,506
Kim Dan may not be
the person you think he is.

924
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:04,841
What do you mean?

925
01:04:04,924 --> 01:04:07,426
Where is he? I have something to ask him.

926
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:09,887
Look at you, doing whatever you want,
you reckless angel.

927
01:04:09,971 --> 01:04:11,848
If you lurk around Yeon-seo one more time,

928
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:15,142
she'll also find out about
the beings of paradise.
