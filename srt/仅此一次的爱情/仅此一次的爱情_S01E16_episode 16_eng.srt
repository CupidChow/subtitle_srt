1
00:00:01,467 --> 00:00:02,867
   

2
00:00:12,067 --> 00:00:14,567
I think I lost my path.

3
00:00:15,407 --> 00:00:20,197
I feel like I'm at a closed road.

4
00:00:22,427 --> 00:00:26,647
Wherever I go, she is there.

5
00:00:27,667 --> 00:00:29,267
I...

6
00:00:30,467 --> 00:00:32,667
Where am I supposed to go?

7
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:35,267
Where would you go?

8
00:00:36,267 --> 00:00:38,167
You should stay here.

9
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:51,467
Look at him.

10
00:00:54,667 --> 00:00:57,667
Dan, it's really nice here.

11
00:00:57,667 --> 00:01:00,067
Yes, you should volunteer here for a few days.

12
00:01:00,067 --> 00:01:03,267
Don't talk to me. I don't want to talk to you.

13
00:01:04,667 --> 00:01:08,367
- Hey! 
- How can you dare to come here?

14
00:01:10,877 --> 00:01:15,257
For those who do not show mercy shall receive judgment without mercy (James 2:13).

15
00:01:15,267 --> 00:01:16,867
You look like you will hit me.

16
00:01:16,867 --> 00:01:18,867
If you were trying to scare me, you did a great job.

17
00:01:18,867 --> 00:01:21,467
I ran away after getting scared of what you said.

18
00:01:21,467 --> 00:01:22,867
You did a great job.

19
00:01:22,867 --> 00:01:26,467
This is the best thing you've done after getting that special mission.

20
00:01:26,467 --> 00:01:29,867
The biggest impediment to your mission was yourself.

21
00:01:29,867 --> 00:01:32,067
You said you were going to finish up your reports, right?

22
00:01:32,067 --> 00:01:34,667
It's a nice time to do that.

23
00:01:34,667 --> 00:01:36,267
You should have high hopes for this report.

24
00:01:36,267 --> 00:01:39,667
I'm going to write about all the violent actions you took.

25
00:01:42,267 --> 00:01:45,967
Looks like I'll be working for once!

26
00:01:45,967 --> 00:01:50,267
Stay away from Noisy Gong and lie low for a while.

27
00:01:50,267 --> 00:01:53,467
Oh, and also. Stay away from Ji Kang Woo.

28
00:01:53,467 --> 00:01:57,167
I will, so stop nagging and go away.

29
00:01:57,167 --> 00:02:02,167
If you say any more, I might really want to retaliate.

30
00:02:36,097 --> 00:02:37,997
What are you doing, Mom?

31
00:02:40,467 --> 00:02:44,067
Where's the measuring tape again? There's something I need to measure.

32
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:58,367
Here it is.

33
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:01,267
Oh! Thank you

34
00:03:14,067 --> 00:03:18,867
Let's have a drink. Come out.

35
00:03:39,067 --> 00:03:44,467
You've always been a good child ever since you were young. I am thankful for that.

36
00:03:44,467 --> 00:03:49,467
I couldn't take care of you while helping Ni Na learn ballet and managing Fantasia.

37
00:03:49,467 --> 00:03:51,467
I've never felt like complaining about it.

38
00:03:51,467 --> 00:03:54,367
Seeing you work was cool and nice.

39
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,667
You've never brought a friend over

40
00:03:56,667 --> 00:04:01,467
and always braided Ni Na's hair for fun to look after her instead of me.

41
00:04:01,467 --> 00:04:03,867
I had no interest in other kids.

42
00:04:03,867 --> 00:04:08,467
Ni Na was so pretty and it was fun dressing her up.

43
00:04:08,467 --> 00:04:11,067
But Mom is something wrong?

44
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:13,067
Why are you suddenly bringing this up?

45
00:04:13,067 --> 00:04:17,867
Was it you? Did you try to kill Yeon Seo?

46
00:04:19,067 --> 00:04:20,667
Mom?

47
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:28,267
Never mind. You seem to be on edge these days.

48
00:04:28,267 --> 00:04:34,767
Roo Na, I want you to see only good things and go to nice places.

49
00:04:34,767 --> 00:04:37,067
Mom will do the rest.

50
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:42,067
You know me. I hate dirty things.

51
00:04:42,067 --> 00:04:46,667
 No! We can't hurt someone to live high off the hog! 

52
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:48,667
 What are you talking about? 

53
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:51,667
 That night on the boat, you had Mr. Park drug her. 

54
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:56,067
 Be quiet. Mr. Park spilled the drink and she didn't get to drink it. 

55
00:04:56,067 --> 00:04:58,867
 Then, what about Mr. Jo? Mr. Park told me everything. 

56
00:04:58,867 --> 00:05:02,067
 Mr. Jo's car that crashed. The brake line was snapped. 

57
00:05:02,067 --> 00:05:04,967
 What? Then... 

58
00:05:05,867 --> 00:05:10,067
 Someone caused the accident on purpose, to kill Mr. Jo and Yeon Seo? 

59
00:05:10,067 --> 00:05:12,767
 It... wasn't you? 

60
00:05:13,467 --> 00:05:15,667
Shall I peel another apple?

61
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:49,467
   

62
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:54,867
He's just not good enough.

63
00:05:54,867 --> 00:05:56,467
Ms. Jeong.

64
00:05:58,067 --> 00:06:00,067
Are you done? How's the atmosphere?

65
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:04,167
I'm dead curious but you won't let me into the practice room.

66
00:06:04,867 --> 00:06:06,867
It's fine. Everybody's nice to me.

67
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,767
 What a lie. 

68
00:06:10,267 --> 00:06:14,067
 Humans are so strange. Why do you lie? 

69
00:06:18,067 --> 00:06:19,767
What's wrong with me?

70
00:06:19,767 --> 00:06:22,867
Miss, do you feel sick?

71
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:28,967
- Ms. Jeong, you go ahead. 
- What?

72
00:06:28,967 --> 00:06:32,267
I've to go somewhere. You can go home.

73
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:34,067
Wait!  Where are you going?

74
00:06:34,067 --> 00:06:35,567
Miss!

75
00:06:37,467 --> 00:06:41,367
Where is she going when here and home are all she knows?

76
00:07:06,067 --> 00:07:10,967
Jeez, that fool keeps leading people here.

77
00:07:13,877 --> 00:07:17,117
Did you ask for the head priest?

78
00:07:18,067 --> 00:07:20,867
Do you know Kim Dan?

79
00:07:20,867 --> 00:07:22,667
Dear Father.

80
00:07:24,067 --> 00:07:29,367
He worked at my place. This was the address that he put on his resume.

81
00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:32,267
How could he give a church's address?

82
00:07:32,267 --> 00:07:35,867
What's wrong with that? He was born and raised here.

83
00:07:35,867 --> 00:07:38,467
He said he had a father who threw him out.

84
00:07:38,467 --> 00:07:41,767
You know what we people mean when we say "father."

85
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,467
How could this be?

86
00:07:49,467 --> 00:07:52,067
How can I not know anything about him?

87
00:07:52,067 --> 00:07:55,267
Where he was born, who his parents are,

88
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:58,267
how he grew up, what he dreamed of becoming.

89
00:07:58,267 --> 00:08:00,167
Don't look for him.

90
00:08:00,967 --> 00:08:02,867
It's just that the time has come.

91
00:08:02,867 --> 00:08:07,367
Humans can't tell the beginning and the end.

92
00:08:07,367 --> 00:08:11,267
Only when it's over do they realize

93
00:08:11,267 --> 00:08:14,367
that their fate is up and it's over.

94
00:08:30,867 --> 00:08:34,867
Where are you? Seriously.

95
00:08:46,867 --> 00:08:47,867
Director Ji.

96
00:08:47,867 --> 00:08:50,067
Are you looking for Kim Dan?

97
00:08:51,267 --> 00:08:52,867
Let's go.

98
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:55,667
Where?

99
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:57,867
To get over him.

100
00:09:13,067 --> 00:09:14,967
 Don't drink. 

101
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:28,667
Make today the last... of having regrets and looking back.

102
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:32,067
Don't jump to conclusions. No one's having regrets.

103
00:09:32,067 --> 00:09:35,867
I could tell you were distracted throughout today's practice.

104
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:40,667
When someone close leaves suddenly, it shocks you.

105
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:43,267
I get that but remember one thing.

106
00:09:43,267 --> 00:09:48,267
Kim Dan may not be the person you think he is.

107
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:50,867
What do you mean?

108
00:09:50,867 --> 00:09:52,457
What do I think of him?

109
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:53,667
What is Dan like?

110
00:09:53,667 --> 00:09:55,867
It's more than what you see.

111
00:09:55,867 --> 00:09:59,067
Perhaps he might be deceiving you.

112
00:09:59,067 --> 00:10:02,167
So, forget about him and get over him.

113
00:10:02,967 --> 00:10:05,467
Why are you bad-mouthing him after he left?

114
00:10:05,467 --> 00:10:08,367
You're right. I don't know anything about him. I realized that even more after he left.

115
00:10:08,367 --> 00:10:10,667
But I know this for sure.

116
00:10:10,667 --> 00:10:13,867
Dan isn't a sly guy who deceives people.

117
00:10:13,867 --> 00:10:17,267
I've never seen someone who was...

118
00:10:17,267 --> 00:10:20,267
as transparent as he was.

119
00:10:20,267 --> 00:10:24,367
You must be worried that I won't do well on "Giselle." Don't worry.

120
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:28,667
I performed a month after my parents passed away and I received a standing ovation for it.

121
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:02,887
What did you expect?

122
00:11:04,007 --> 00:11:07,777
Did you think he'd be sitting here like the first day we met?

123
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:16,707
Kim Dan, where are you?

124
00:11:20,197 --> 00:11:22,607
Wherever I go, I always see you.

125
00:11:22,607 --> 00:11:27,447
I saw you at the bar, too. I can't even go home now.

126
00:11:27,447 --> 00:11:29,707
Now that you're gone,

127
00:11:30,577 --> 00:11:33,367
everything has gotten messy.

128
00:11:33,367 --> 00:11:35,097
Kim Dan,

129
00:11:36,157 --> 00:11:38,637
I need you.

130
00:11:38,637 --> 00:11:41,037
I said I need you.

131
00:11:43,857 --> 00:11:46,057
Get a grip, Yeon Seo.

132
00:11:59,687 --> 00:12:03,787
Is that... really you?

133
00:12:05,017 --> 00:12:08,507
Kim Dan, is that really you?

134
00:12:08,507 --> 00:12:12,047
You were right. It was my mistake.

135
00:12:12,047 --> 00:12:14,267
I shouldn't have been nice to you.

136
00:12:15,287 --> 00:12:20,387
I was a tiny bit nice to you and you're so smitten. I didn't know it'd be so easy to win you over.

137
00:12:21,297 --> 00:12:25,687
Can't you understand? I was focused on my work and it was only a brief moment.

138
00:12:25,687 --> 00:12:27,827
I just got carried away for a brief moment.

139
00:12:27,827 --> 00:12:30,697
Because you were a such a spoiled ice queen,

140
00:12:30,697 --> 00:12:33,097
I was just doing you a favor.

141
00:12:35,037 --> 00:12:39,057
Don't get hung up on someone like me. Find someone who's really on your side.

142
00:12:39,057 --> 00:12:43,457
Find someone who will stay with you to the end. Got it?

143
00:12:48,257 --> 00:12:50,247
Stop it.

144
00:12:50,247 --> 00:12:51,677
Let go.

145
00:12:54,097 --> 00:12:55,987
I'll go first.

146
00:12:58,797 --> 00:13:02,707
I won't see you leave ever again.

147
00:13:02,707 --> 00:13:07,887
It was always you who ran away first at home and at the park.

148
00:13:09,607 --> 00:13:11,327
Not this time.

149
00:13:13,687 --> 00:13:15,547
Remember this.

150
00:13:16,077 --> 00:13:20,037
I'm... leaving you.

151
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:23,037
It's you who will be...

152
00:13:23,967 --> 00:13:25,507
left alone.

153
00:13:46,317 --> 00:13:51,057
He didn't exist. He never existed.

154
00:13:51,667 --> 00:13:53,497
Although he existed,

155
00:13:54,637 --> 00:13:57,357
pretend that he never existed.

156
00:13:57,357 --> 00:13:59,247
That's what I'll do.

157
00:13:59,917 --> 00:14:01,937
I can do this.

158
00:14:01,937 --> 00:14:04,567
I can do this. I can do it.

159
00:14:06,117 --> 00:14:10,187
Say something to me.

160
00:14:12,087 --> 00:14:14,067
What do you want me to do?!

161
00:14:41,037 --> 00:14:43,527
 Is that me? You're awful at drawing. 

162
00:14:43,527 --> 00:14:45,827
 It's not you. 

163
00:15:06,667 --> 00:15:11,697
Stop dreaming, human. Stop dreaming useless dreams.

164
00:15:28,277 --> 00:15:32,177
Grandmother. Grandmother!

165
00:15:33,497 --> 00:15:37,217
Call my honey.

166
00:15:38,207 --> 00:15:41,707
Call my honey.

167
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:44,587
Call my honey!

168
00:15:44,587 --> 00:15:47,397
Why isn't this working?

169
00:15:47,397 --> 00:15:50,247
Why isn't it working?

170
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:54,417
Grandmother.

171
00:15:54,417 --> 00:15:56,437
Is that you?

172
00:15:57,817 --> 00:16:00,297
This is incredible.

173
00:16:00,297 --> 00:16:05,367
It wasn't working before. This thing really called you here.

174
00:16:11,147 --> 00:16:12,487
I'm...

175
00:16:12,487 --> 00:16:18,467
In my dream, I went to a beautiful field of reeds.

176
00:16:18,467 --> 00:16:21,367
I was holding hands with you

177
00:16:21,367 --> 00:16:25,677
and we walked together. It was beautiful.

178
00:16:25,677 --> 00:16:29,957
- Can you take me there? 
- What?

179
00:16:29,957 --> 00:16:30,987
Where?

180
00:16:30,987 --> 00:16:33,197
There.

181
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:38,367
That field of reeds.

182
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:45,907
Do you remember the day we met for the first time?

183
00:16:45,907 --> 00:16:47,787
How was it?

184
00:16:48,837 --> 00:16:51,947
 You lied. 

185
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:02,747
 Is that you? 

186
00:17:04,537 --> 00:17:09,387
 You're wearing the white suit that you had on for our wedding. 

187
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:15,147
 What am I going to do? 

188
00:17:16,557 --> 00:17:19,467
 I've aged too much. 

189
00:17:20,007 --> 00:17:22,657
 Don't I look ugly? 

190
00:17:23,607 --> 00:17:27,547
 You look pretty, just like that day. 

191
00:17:35,427 --> 00:17:40,007
Thank you... for lying.

192
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:46,367
I was happy... every single day.

193
00:17:47,707 --> 00:17:49,877
I was truly happy...

194
00:17:50,997 --> 00:17:53,757
that I could do that.

195
00:17:56,547 --> 00:17:59,457
Are you all right? Let's go back to the sanatorium now.

196
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:04,317
Thank you, young man.

197
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:08,177
For what you did that day and today.

198
00:18:08,707 --> 00:18:12,647
Do you know who I am? Is your memory back?

199
00:18:12,647 --> 00:18:16,867
I only wish that everything was a dream.

200
00:18:16,867 --> 00:18:19,697
I thought I braced myself for it.

201
00:18:20,537 --> 00:18:26,197
During the 70 years of my life, we've said goodbye so many times.

202
00:18:26,197 --> 00:18:31,687
Saying goodbye is hard every time, you know.

203
00:18:34,807 --> 00:18:38,787
It was here. This was the spot, right?

204
00:18:44,027 --> 00:18:49,867
He only left behind this handkerchief with a feather on it.

205
00:18:49,867 --> 00:18:52,457
This is the only thing that he left behind.

206
00:18:56,237 --> 00:19:00,007
His body disappeared as if he was never here.

207
00:19:02,897 --> 00:19:04,897
How futile this is.

208
00:19:06,927 --> 00:19:11,217
Please come to this world as a human in your next life.

209
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:14,757
I will be your guardian angel.

210
00:19:15,437 --> 00:19:19,177
You knew? That he was an angel?

211
00:19:20,477 --> 00:19:22,877
Weren't you scared?

212
00:19:22,877 --> 00:19:26,407
He's not a human. He’s like a spirit or a monster.

213
00:19:26,407 --> 00:19:30,687
No monster in this world could be as kindhearted as he was.

214
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:36,387
When I said that he was my husband who passed away 30 years ago,

215
00:19:36,387 --> 00:19:40,097
he played along and said that he was.

216
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:42,977
Every day for a year,

217
00:19:42,977 --> 00:19:46,457
he lied to me with a kind heart.

218
00:19:46,457 --> 00:19:49,307
 You don't need to spend a long time for it to be true love. 

219
00:19:49,307 --> 00:19:53,907
 If you can give her love that can amount to 1000 years' worth of love, that's all. 

220
00:19:54,737 --> 00:19:59,497
How can that be possible?

221
00:19:59,497 --> 00:20:04,167
I... ran away.

222
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:06,847
Because I was scared.

223
00:20:06,847 --> 00:20:09,347
Of disappearing?

224
00:20:09,347 --> 00:20:11,057
No.

225
00:20:13,177 --> 00:20:15,687
That I would hold on to her.

226
00:20:17,687 --> 00:20:22,797
When we're together, I want to hold her hand and hug her.

227
00:20:24,407 --> 00:20:26,177
But if I do that,

228
00:20:28,297 --> 00:20:30,947
I thought I would make Yeon Seo sad.

229
00:20:33,467 --> 00:20:35,777
I thought she might become unhappy.

230
00:20:40,637 --> 00:20:45,387
I... don't have any regrets.

231
00:20:49,187 --> 00:20:51,357
I'm sad.

232
00:20:53,697 --> 00:20:56,417
My heart is torn apart.

233
00:21:00,547 --> 00:21:03,837
But that is my fate.

234
00:21:04,687 --> 00:21:06,907
It was me.

235
00:21:08,217 --> 00:21:12,957
I'm the one he came across. I'm grateful.

236
00:21:14,257 --> 00:21:16,827
I don't resent him.

237
00:21:19,397 --> 00:21:22,037
You know what, young man?

238
00:21:22,037 --> 00:21:27,997
In this world, there's no such thing as meeting someone for no reason.

239
00:21:29,277 --> 00:21:32,067
I believe in fate.

240
00:21:33,107 --> 00:21:38,747
We met each other...

241
00:21:40,397 --> 00:21:42,767
because of it.

242
00:21:45,727 --> 00:21:49,967
Grandmother. Grandmother. Grandmother!

243
00:21:49,967 --> 00:21:54,597
♫  I like it  ♫

244
00:21:54,597 --> 00:21:56,547
What do I do?

245
00:21:58,247 --> 00:22:02,677
What am I to do if you leave like this? Huh?

246
00:22:27,787 --> 00:22:29,307
   

247
00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:34,217
 You said we're a part of His big plans and providence, didn't you? 

248
00:22:35,217 --> 00:22:40,137
 Then, was it a part of the plan to take away the last hope of someone who is 

249
00:22:40,137 --> 00:22:42,637
 poor and lonely? 

250
00:22:43,497 --> 00:22:49,007
 And what is providence for the one who refuses to blame Him till the very end? 

251
00:22:50,137 --> 00:22:52,627
 Did He have 

252
00:22:52,627 --> 00:22:56,847
 a plan for me that He made since the beginning of time? 

253
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:00,577
 I want to identify 

254
00:23:00,577 --> 00:23:02,947
 the root of such feelings. 

255
00:23:04,707 --> 00:23:08,557
♫  Stay this way focused  ♫

256
00:23:08,557 --> 00:23:12,587
♫  In this land I'll pray  ♫

257
00:23:13,687 --> 00:23:15,467
♫  of you  ♫

258
00:23:15,467 --> 00:23:17,817
Now, we'll begin the maiden scene.

259
00:23:17,817 --> 00:23:21,407
Please show each person's depiction of "Giselle."

260
00:23:30,957 --> 00:23:32,767
 Why Yeon Seo? 

261
00:23:32,767 --> 00:23:37,417
 Why did you send me to her of all people? 

262
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:42,247
 Yes, I saved her on that rainy day. 

263
00:23:43,067 --> 00:23:45,187
♫  Always~  ♫

264
00:23:45,187 --> 00:23:50,387
 But she recognized me first. 

265
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,577
Why is that?

266
00:23:52,577 --> 00:23:55,337
♫  Stay with me this way  ♫

267
00:23:55,337 --> 00:23:58,497
I want to stay by her side.

268
00:23:58,497 --> 00:24:03,037
 Even more so... now that I left her side. 

269
00:24:03,037 --> 00:24:07,047
 If there's even one reason for me to stay, 

270
00:24:07,047 --> 00:24:11,507
 then please... help me find it. 

271
00:24:11,507 --> 00:24:18,077
 I don't care where the road leads me to. I will gladly go down that road. 

272
00:24:19,037 --> 00:24:20,857
Next!

273
00:24:39,417 --> 00:24:41,287
 You want me to cover my eyes? 

274
00:24:41,287 --> 00:24:44,567
 If it's a tragedy, the woman that went blind from betrayal, 

275
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:47,547
 you need to be her. 

276
00:24:47,547 --> 00:24:52,647
 With that, you can run towards the revengeful finale that the director wants. 

277
00:25:03,767 --> 00:25:06,517
Nice try.

278
00:25:06,517 --> 00:25:08,397
But are you going to do this on the stage?

279
00:25:08,397 --> 00:25:13,507
Mimicking the emotion by using this blindfold isn't genuine.

280
00:25:13,507 --> 00:25:15,287
Next.

281
00:25:15,287 --> 00:25:18,627
Lee Yeon Seo, are you ready?

282
00:25:23,827 --> 00:25:25,837
Stop!

283
00:25:27,167 --> 00:25:28,717
Why?

284
00:25:28,717 --> 00:25:30,527
What are you doing right now?

285
00:25:30,527 --> 00:25:36,557
Why are you showing me the Giselle from 200 years ago? I'm certain you said you liked the new Giselle.

286
00:25:36,557 --> 00:25:39,667
I did, but I changed my mind. It doesn't seem right.

287
00:25:39,667 --> 00:25:44,667
But now... Giselle was betrayed.

288
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:47,387
She hit on him, began to date him, and found out he was two-timing.

289
00:25:47,387 --> 00:25:49,957
How can you be so heartbroken?

290
00:25:49,957 --> 00:25:52,057
Because she's sad.

291
00:25:53,667 --> 00:25:59,937
I didn't know you would depict Giselle as such a passive character.

292
00:26:01,907 --> 00:26:03,967
If you hate and curse someone, you don't go crazy.

293
00:26:03,967 --> 00:26:10,037
You have to be completely sane if you wish to hate someone. Do you know why she went crazy?

294
00:26:10,037 --> 00:26:11,897
She was sad.

295
00:26:11,897 --> 00:26:14,907
Because she was so sad. That's how much she loved him.

296
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:17,517
That's exactly the classical and old-fashioned Giselle!

297
00:26:17,517 --> 00:26:19,367
Because you only look at her from the outside!

298
00:26:19,367 --> 00:26:23,327
If you go into the core, her heart will make the audience cry.

299
00:26:24,187 --> 00:26:27,057
I'll show you. Watch carefully.

300
00:26:54,267 --> 00:26:58,437
 I'm sad. I'm sad. 

301
00:27:01,397 --> 00:27:04,737
 My feelings haven't stopped. 

302
00:27:04,737 --> 00:27:06,957
 But this love is coming to an end. 

303
00:27:06,957 --> 00:27:09,887
 You were right. I made a mistake. 

304
00:27:09,887 --> 00:27:12,487
 I shouldn't have been warm towards you. 

305
00:27:16,387 --> 00:27:19,077
 Why can't you... 

306
00:27:19,077 --> 00:27:22,457
 be mine? 

307
00:27:22,457 --> 00:27:25,267
 Why does everything have to disappear? 

308
00:27:25,267 --> 00:27:29,867
 You have always been useless. I must have been delusional. 

309
00:27:29,867 --> 00:27:35,017
  While we're on the topic, pack your things and leave this house right now!

- Gosh, you and your temper. 
- Stop it.

326
00:29:21,487 --> 00:29:23,557
Hello.

327
00:29:24,907 --> 00:29:26,367
Are you here on a trip?

328
00:29:26,367 --> 00:29:29,027
Do you need a room?

329
00:29:29,027 --> 00:29:31,407
No. I'm looking for something.

330
00:29:31,407 --> 00:29:35,037
Is there a rumor that this is a treasure island?

331
00:29:37,397 --> 00:29:40,707
Grandmother, have you lived on this island for a long time?

332
00:29:40,707 --> 00:29:44,397
What long time? I've lived here forever.

333
00:29:44,397 --> 00:29:48,137
Then, do you happen to know the house with the blue gate?

334
00:29:48,137 --> 00:29:53,217
In the past, a kid about this height lived there.

335
00:29:55,407 --> 00:29:58,267
 The blue-gate house on the hill over there? 

336
00:29:58,267 --> 00:30:01,867
 A little boy and his drunk father used to live there. 

337
00:30:01,867 --> 00:30:04,917
 But one day, they just suddenly disappeared. 

338
00:30:44,177 --> 00:30:46,527
  Come here, you little punk!  

339
00:30:49,677 --> 00:30:53,527
 That little jerk. Darn it. 

340
00:30:53,527 --> 00:30:56,267
 This bastard. 

341
00:30:56,267 --> 00:30:58,997
 Where are you hiding? 

342
00:30:58,997 --> 00:31:04,877
 I'm going to go crazy because of this damn rain. 

343
00:31:11,277 --> 00:31:13,027
 Not yet. 

344
00:31:19,997 --> 00:31:21,707
 What are you doing? Come out! 

345
00:31:21,707 --> 00:31:23,497
No!

346
00:31:58,927 --> 00:32:01,147
  Are you really going to be like that?  

347
00:32:01,147 --> 00:32:03,407
 I'm leaving tomorrow! 

348
00:32:03,407 --> 00:32:06,417
 Not even to Seoul, but Russia! 

349
00:32:06,417 --> 00:32:09,817
 I'll get on a plane and go far, far away. 

350
00:32:14,127 --> 00:32:16,857
 I know you're there! 

351
00:32:21,257 --> 00:32:25,227
 Forget it. I don't want to be your friend anymore! 

352
00:32:37,327 --> 00:32:39,747
It wasn't a dream.

353
00:32:39,747 --> 00:32:44,327
It definitely happened.

354
00:33:15,447 --> 00:33:18,287
 I was beaten up whenever it rained. 

355
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:23,087
 So... I never went out after it rained. 

356
00:33:23,087 --> 00:33:24,797
 That's why I have never seen 

357
00:33:24,797 --> 00:33:26,757
 a rainbow before. 

358
00:33:26,757 --> 00:33:30,917
 The girl who showed me a rainbow for the first time. 

359
00:33:35,987 --> 00:33:39,057
 I wanted to be a grown-up to her. 

360
00:33:39,897 --> 00:33:42,497
 I didn't want to die. 

361
00:33:42,497 --> 00:33:44,137
  I'm Yeon Seo.  

362
00:33:44,137 --> 00:33:47,317
  Lee Yeon Seo. And you?  

363
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:48,717
 I'm... 

364
00:33:48,717 --> 00:33:52,677
  I'm... My name is...  

365
00:33:53,667 --> 00:34:00,667


366
00:34:13,427 --> 00:34:16,057
      
   My name is... Seong Woo.  

367
00:34:16,057 --> 00:34:17,017
  Seong Woo  

368
00:34:17,017 --> 00:34:18,287
 Yoo Seong Woo. 

369
00:34:18,287 --> 00:34:19,867
  Yoo Seong Woo.  

370
00:34:19,867 --> 00:34:27,817
♫  Tonight stars are pouring down,  ♫ 
♫  While I think of you alone,  ♫

371
00:34:27,817 --> 00:34:35,587
♫  Will you know I feel infatuated?  ♫

372
00:34:35,587 --> 00:34:39,717
♫  On a night when cherry blossoms are scattering,  ♫

373
00:34:39,717 --> 00:34:43,407
♫  Through the warm wind under the moonlight,  ♫

374
00:34:43,407 --> 00:34:47,207
♫  I long for you all alone  ♫

375
00:34:47,207 --> 00:34:50,857
     

376
00:34:50,857 --> 00:34:54,187
 Why did you let me remember everything? 

377
00:34:54,187 --> 00:34:56,557
  I'm really sorry.  

378
00:34:56,557 --> 00:34:59,017
  I won't take long. I promise you.  

379
00:34:59,017 --> 00:35:01,437
 He says to wait a little longer and that he needs time. 

380
00:35:01,437 --> 00:35:02,737
 Is this guy married? 

381
00:35:02,737 --> 00:35:04,237
  Please stop crying because of that jerk.  

382
00:35:04,237 --> 00:35:06,647
 He's unbelievable. He pretended to be so noble. 

383
00:35:06,647 --> 00:35:08,627
 Don't mind him and don't listen to him. 

384
00:35:08,627 --> 00:35:10,477
  Whether it's love or happiness, I'll give them to her  

385
00:35:10,477 --> 00:35:11,237
  so back off.  

386
00:35:11,237 --> 00:35:14,427
 I wanted to be a grown-up. 

387
00:35:14,427 --> 00:35:16,047
  I wanted to protect her.  

388
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:18,887
  What are you saying? Why would he be dead?  

389
00:35:18,887 --> 00:35:22,117
  Are you doing well, Kim Dan?  

390
00:35:22,117 --> 00:35:24,800
