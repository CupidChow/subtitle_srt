1
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:10,650


2
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,490
 That human was supposed to die.   

3
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:20,110
 It was just postponed, that's all. No matter how much you try to escape from it, 

4
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,620
 a prophecy will come to pass 

5
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,480
 and fate always comes true. 

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,680
♫  ...remembers you  ♫

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,950
Let's do it.

8
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:34,840
♫  ...of the passing wind  ♫

9
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:39,190
Will you...

10
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,190
marry me,

11
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,430
Lee Yeon Seo?

12
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:47,220
♫  You, you  ♫

13
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:54,770
♫  You never leave my mind  ♫

14
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:58,460
♫  Even my naive  ♫

15
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:03,540
♫  and difficult love  ♫

16
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:09,640
♫  Always blow from the same place  ♫

17
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,820
♫  and become the scent that permeates me  ♫

18
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:19,140
♫  You never leave my mind  ♫

19
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,200
Should we do it tomorrow?

20
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,020
That soon, without thinking it through?
   

21
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,110
We don't have time. The Gizelle performance

22
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,230
will be in ten days, and I want to do it before that.

23
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,660
What changed your mind?

24
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,840
What?

25
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:40,030
Just before the rehearsal, you didn't want to get married. Why did you suddenly change your mind?

26
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,360
It wasn't sudden. I also wanted to do it.

27
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,730
And I thought you changed your mind after becoming human.

28
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:47,780
How can you say that?

29
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,740
I'd have played hard to get. I said "yes" too quickly.

30
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:56,060
I made the marriage proposal and bought the ring. I got rejected so many days.

31
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,460
This is bruising my pride.

32
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:01,500
Cancel it. It's not too late now.

33
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,360
Are you sure?

34
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,060
Do it. I'm not afraid of that.

35
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,350
You're really...

36
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:15,370
If you cancel it, I can do it again.

37
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:19,870
Whether it's once or hundreds of times, I'll officially do it again.

38
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,570
What is this, Kim Dan?

39
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,230
Lee Yeon Seo,

40
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,440
you're my first for everything.

41
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,750
When I was a human, an angel, and even now,

42
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,670
you're the only one.

43
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:49,000
I wanted to live because of you and wanted to become human because of you.

44
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:55,770
I hesitated like a fool and worried.

45
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:02,990
But if you are fine with me, will you marry me?

46
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:09,400
You are mean. You picked all the words out of my mouth.

47
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,150
I'll make you happy.

48
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,150
I promise you.

49
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:26,020
Let's live together for eternity.

50
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,580
 Destined to be killed by an evil person. 

51
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:46,680
 Some are born with it. 

52
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,160
 It was just postponed, that's all. 

53
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,320
 No matter how much you try to escape from it, 

54
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,450
 a prophecy will come to pass 

55
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,490
 and fate always comes true. 

56
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,180
   

57
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,560
I thought it was fate.

58
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,010
Meeting Lee Yeon Seo. Remembering Lee Yeon Seo.

59
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,510
Loving Lee Yeon Seo.

60
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,650
Because it was all your doing.

61
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:38,940
The act of making me disappear and ending me,

62
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,150
I'm not afraid of it at all.

63
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:51,920
I'm only scared of hurting and giving Yeon Seo a hard time.

64
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:57,180
But I know this.

65
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,090
You say it's Yeon Seo's fate to die.

66
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:05,220
No. I can't accept that command.

67
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,740
Even if you said its a prophecy, I will change it.

68
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:14,470
Things will not go your way, but my way.

69
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,750
 Yeon Seo, are you sleeping? 

70
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,300
No.

71
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,950
 I'm coming in. 

72
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,380
Did you go somewhere?

73
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:55,010
There's something I couldn't tell you earlier.

74
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,080
What is it?

75
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,800
Yeon Seo,

76
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:12,960
I...

77
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,850
What is it? Why the scary face?

78
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,820
I didn't become human.

79
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,620
It looks like I won't be able to.

80
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:38,380
I thought I became human,

81
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,600
but that wasn't the case.

82
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,250
I thought I got permission to be happy with you,

83
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,060
but I didn't.

84
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,080
So what?

85
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,090
Whether you're an angel or human, it's doesn't matter at all.

86
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:13,510
We might have to give this up.

87
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,820
You just have to grab it again. You said

88
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:25,020
if I cancel the wedding, you would propose to me a hundred times or a thousand times.

89
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,480
I would do that, too.

90
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:32,020
I can also hold your hand a hundred times.

91
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,010
I won't lose to God.

92
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:41,820
I might even disappear in front of you.

93
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,100
You're not scared?

94
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:53,560
I'm afraid of not being there by your side at that moment

95
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,460
that you'll be alone again

96
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:01,540
and face your ending lonely.

97
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:08,430
I will never leave you alone.

98
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:16,740
So, Kim Dan, let's stay together.

99
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,030
 Let's only cry up to today. 

100
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:28,770
 Starting tomorrow, let's smile happily, 

101
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,210
 as if we have all the time in the world. 

102
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,840
 Agree? 

103
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,590
What is it?

104
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:01,020
As soon as I got here, you sat me down. What do you want to say?

105
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,900
Ms. Jeong, I want to marry Miss.

106
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,800
Please give Miss to me.

107
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,740
What are you doing?

108
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:14,540
I may be lacking but if you give us your blessing, I will forever make Miss happy.

109
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:19,150
I don't know where he saw this but he really wanted to try it out.

110
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,890
Please play along.

111
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:25,910
I must know my role in order for me to do so.

112
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,440
Are you serious about getting married?

113
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,710
How can you advance as fast as fiber-optic cable?

114
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,890
Please give us your blessing!

115
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,010
I mean, who am I that you'd do this—

116
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:48,140
I really want to get your permission since you're the only one in this house I can ask.

117
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,560
Please play along for him.

118
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,640
Dream on, punk!

119
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:08,440
I have been taking care of our Yeon Seo since she was young with all my effort.

120
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,580
Her beauty, intelligence, personality— is a bit...

121
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,260
But she's not lacking in anything.

122
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:18,120
How dare you, gigolo-looking guy, covet her?

123
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,480
What do you have, huh?

124
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:26,200
How dare you covet your boss without knowing your stance?

125
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:26,980
No way!

126
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,930
Over my dead body—

127
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,750
Ms. Jeong!

128
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,690
How can you be so harsh?

129
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:38,410
What's wrong with Kim Dan? There is no man like him in the world!

130
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:42,820
It's not the medieval era. How can you say such harsh things to him?

131
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,320
I'm really disappointed in you, Ms. Jeong!

132
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,000
I mean... I just played along.

133
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,540
No matter what anyone says, I'm going to marry Kim Dan even if the heavens are against it!

134
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,800
In a week,

135
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,980
in the garden. So prepare everything. Got it?

136
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,360
I'm sorry, Butler Jeong. It's my fault.

137
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,630
I mean what else did you want me to do?!

138
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,130
You're good at acting.

139
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:40,530
When I was a student, I was part of the acting club.

140
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:46,120
I'm sorry for going overboard.

141
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,820
Is he not going to leave anymore?

142
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,940
Miss, I like Dan.

143
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,800
He's cute and handsome, and he's nice.

144
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,190
But the important person to me isn't Dan.

145
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:09,630
It's you. I kind of meant it earlier.

146
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,710
Love is nice for now,

147
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:17,120
but the heart changes by itself.

148
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,270
I can't see you being left alone anymore.

149
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:26,230
Don't be like that. It doesn't suit you.

150
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:29,190
It's not like we have any affection for each other.

151
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:32,860
Of course.

152
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:37,690
Without affection, we will continue to be together for a really long time.

153
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,670
Don't worry.

154
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:50,620
I'm fine with being left alone. I can live with the happiness I have right now.

155
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:59,010
     

156
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:05,460
 I regret trying so hard 

157
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,670
 to be recognized by you. 

158
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:26,980
You should still dance. After I was kicked out by your mother,

159
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,970
I knew that she would be ruined by her greed someday.

160
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:32,970
But Geum Ni Na, the arts live on

161
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:38,300
even when there is a fire in the house or your parents die.

162
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,790
- So do it. 
 -  I see you're telling me to be the understudy.

163
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,650
What do you have left?

164
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,620
Ji Kang Woo? Family?

165
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:57,440
Dance is the only thing you have left.

166
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,930
What is this?

167
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:10,310
Thank you for everything.

168
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,060
What are your planning on doing?

169
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,300
Because of you, I realized many things.

170
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:24,400
But I won't become like my family members.

171
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,330
Even if I danced as Giselle after hurting Yeon Seo,

172
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:30,460
that's not mine after all.

173
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,580
Let go of that hand!

174
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:40,530
So it was you. I knew that Ni Na had someone.

175
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:41,680
How did you get here, Director?

176
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,340
I asked Geon Woo.

177
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,590
I checked many places to find you.

178
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,870
Don't mind yourself.

179
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:53,540
By spying on me, what did you want to do with Ni Na?

180
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,880
What did you do to Ni Na?

181
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,450
I did something better than you.

182
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,050
I made her break out of her shell.

183
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:04,470
A dance to eat herself up will be bound to be destroyed.

184
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,980
That was the Giselle you wanted.

185
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,040
Both of you please stop!

186
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,130
It all ended. There is no use for this!

187
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,740
Take it. Don't do this.

188
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:29,700
How can I dance again?

189
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,650
In a day, I feel like dying a million times.

190
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:35,450
I'm going crazy because it feels like it's my fault and it'll all be fine if I disappear.

191
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:39,050
Then, what's the use of dance?

192
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:43,300
Give me a chance. A chance to use you.

193
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:47,850
I'm definitely going to put out a proper and magnificent Giselle.

194
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:52,550
For Yeon Seo?

195
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,800
For Yeon Seo.

196
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:58,420
For you, for the corps de ballet,

197
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,930
and for me.

198
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:03,500
Since that was my goal.

199
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,950
Lies.

200
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:11,340
Your goal... was Yeon Seo.

201
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,820
Goodbye.

202
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:35,730
 The dark side of Fantasia. It was her own family who was after the best ballerina. 

203
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,470
     

204
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:42,830
I heard that Executive Chairman and Team Leader will be interrogated but they didn't summon the vice-team leader yet.

205
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,310
Why aren't they arresting her?

206
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:47,010
I told them that Geum Roo Na instigated it.

207
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:50,700
Ki Joon Soo, he still hasn't been caught even though he was the underling,

208
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,130
since there isn't enough evidence (to arrest her.)

209
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,020
All done?

210
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:03,960
Shall we get going?

211
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,840
What to do?

212
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:09,110
I'm really nervous.

213

If you're this incompatible from the beginning what will happen?

220
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,420
Your marital compatibility must be bad.

221
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,330
It's not.

222

Let's not get this one.

Why? It's pretty.

234
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,290
Why are you buying so much?

235

Do you know how much you have been spending today?

236

239
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:06,030
The sweet phase won't last long,

240
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:09,100

You should also tell me what you like.

Look quickly.

259
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,020
All right.

260
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,870
The groom is usually like that because it's troublesome.

261
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:49,220
Usually, they just want to get it over with.

It's not!

265
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,800
And they tend to break up the engagement.

266
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,840
If you can't agree on these, you can't get married.

273
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,040
How petty can an angel be, trying people to break up?

274
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,690
Why can't I when another angel is trying to marry a human?

275
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,440
Please leave before Yeon Seo comes out.

276
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,490
I won't change my mind.

277
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,240
Please, Dan!

278
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,720
Don't walk into the fire!

279
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:50,780
It can't be helped.

280
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:54,850
Since the angel is not listening, I'll have to persuade the human.

281
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:56,750
Don't.

282
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:30,820
I am not asking too much. Please leave me alone!

283
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:33,460
I can't let you disappear.

284
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,190
I don't want that.

285
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,980
I told you everything.

286
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,580
That human... That human will die soon!

287
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:42,020
Why can't you give her up?

288
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:47,700
Why waste time with a human who'll crumble soon, Dan?!

289
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:53,450
If there's no ending... does it make it not vain?

290
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:55,100
It's the opposite, Senior.

291
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:59,870
Because it has an end... Because it has an ending, you have no idea how brilliant each day is.

292
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:03,610
Because it's not forever, we want to promise eternally.

293
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,590
Do you understand?!

294

You are a senior to Dan but not to me.

You should lead properly as his senior.

Don't hit Dan. I won't stand for it!

Okay... Okay.

310
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:07,250
Ms. Yeon Seo, about getting married—

311
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,420
How about becoming our officiant?

312
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,630
What? Me?

313
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,690
That might be troublesome for you.

314
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:16,650
Then, how about you come in that day and giving us your blessing?

315
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:17,630
Hey, Noisy Gong.

316
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:19,450
To be honest with you, I don't feel like doing this.

317
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:24,460
What did God do for us? What did he to for Dan?

318
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,120
Yeon Seo.

319
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:30,030
But you are Dan's only family in this world.

320
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,430
I ask this of you.

321
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:47,890
I think that the wedding won't happen.

322
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:52,090
No one will be able to get His blessing.

323
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:52,660
Senior!

324
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,880
I will give it up now.

325
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,340
Try living with this punk that doesn't listen.

326
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:45,720
Don't mind what Senior said.

327
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,790
I don't need his blessing.

328
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:51,140
As long as you're here, that will do.

329
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:54,860
But one thing is bothering me.

330
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:55,620
What is it?

331
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,500
The fact that you don't listen to people.

332
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,950
Let's laugh. We decided to do that.

333
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:13,980
Ta-da!

334
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,400
What is this?

335
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,580
Our wedding invitation.

336
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:23,010
We don't have anyone to invite but I just want to have it for our keepsake.

337
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:28,730
Tell me honestly. You've dated before, haven't you?

338
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,360
Are you telling me I'm good?

339
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,540
Give me this.

340
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,490
Even if you do this, you won't be forgiven.

341
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:45,720
Think carefully.

342
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,240
Don't be like this. It's not your doing. Why are you trying to take responsibility for everything?

343
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,540
You didn't do it either!

344
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,950
It was my sin to overlook it.

345
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:06,450
My sin to allow things to get worse thus far. My laziness was the sin.

346
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:10,250
Even now, to save my child,

347
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:17,610
I should pay the price.

348
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:20,650
I told you I would pay for it.

349
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:25,730
If you wait for me, I will go plant onions after prison time.

350
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:28,960
I will plant and grow

351
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,300
anything you want including spring onions and dropwort.

352
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,470
I...

353
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,290
It's too late.

354
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:40,560
We should never live with our hearts at ease anymore, Yeong Ja.

355
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:21,140
You were hiding in my office like a cat burglar.

356
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:28,390
Instead of doing that, I have a question, so it worked out.

357
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,680
Have a seat.

358
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:33,310
Stop right now. It's your last chance.

359
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,740
What did I do?

360
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:39,910
You should know best what you did wrong.

361
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:45,140
Do you have a superpower or something?

362
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,390
I thought it was strange

363
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:52,400
that she was sound and healthy after falling off of a skyscraper

364
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,190
and a person was hanging on the building within the blink of an eye.

365
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:00,310
Those aren't things a normal human can do.

366
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,850
Tell me.

367
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:08,680
I like those things. They're fun.

368
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:13,360
You say it's fun to play with people's lives?

369
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:20,710
Because I like strong people who do their jobs well.

370
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:25,310
Wouldn't it be good to do fun things together?

371
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,910
You're rotten up to the root.

372
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:38,190
Whatever evil deed you are planning will not work out.

373
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:43,640
I saved her from a car accident and when she fell from the building.

374
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:47,300
So, stop now, without wasting your energy.

375
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:52,930
As for good and evil,

376
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:57,330
they can't be divided clearly.

377
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:01,910
But it's been decided when it comes to which one will win.

378
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:04,850
You are bound to lose.

379
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,010
Do you know why?

380
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:11,960
If I were you, I would have killed you as soon as you entered this office.

381
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:16,430
The good ones are always slow and dull.

382
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:19,750
That's why you lose.

383
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,910
Because you're human.

384
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:28,510
Humans do wrong deeds, regret them, and then ask for forgiveness.

385
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:31,190
I wish you could understand (the lesson).

386
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,820
Stop right now.

387
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:41,030
If you dare to do a stupid thing, I

388
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:46,130
might even kill you for sure.

389
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:56,570
