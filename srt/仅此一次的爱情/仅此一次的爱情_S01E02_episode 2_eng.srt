1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:03,110
Oh no. Where is it?

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:04,770
   

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,410
Ah, darn it!

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,630
 I assigned the mentioned angel to be in charge of animals in the human world. 

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,530
 It's that handkerchief, right? The one that is given to the angels that are sent out. 

6
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:22,400
 It's a token that proves you're an angel and  your connection 

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,870
 to this land and Heaven, so you must not lose it. 

8
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:29,080
 You must always have it on you. 

9
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,610
No, no way

10
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,510
Could it be wit—

11
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:40,540
Come out, you pathetic jerk.

12
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,910
You cult member!

13
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:52,540


14
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,370
You keep having nightmares.

15
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:04,060
My dreams are always nightmares, and they're always in bright colors.

16
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:08,080
- Tomorrow— 
 - I won't go to Fantasia.

17
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,010
I was going to ask what time we should go to the columbarium?

18
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:17,840
Thoughtless people, how could they choose this day?

19
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,920
Yeon Seo, I will surely be on your side.

20
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:27,650
Mr. Jo, do you know that I get creeped out sometimes?

21
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,190
How can you always be on my side?

22
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:35,030
How do you adjust everything according to me? Why do you always take my side, no matter what I do?

23
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:38,550
I'm always called the annoying and furious b*tch.

24
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,070
Isn't it the norm to be gossiping?

25
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:46,170
- Yeon Seo— 
 - I told you not to call me like that.

26
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,880
That's enough. Please leave. I'm tired.

27
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:56,390
I know who you truly are.

28
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:59,040
I told you not to pretend to know me so well.

29
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,090
   

30
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,200
 I can't see the star of the show. 

31
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,680
 It's all right. He's our new driver. 

32
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,390
 Hello, Princess. I'm Jo Seung Hwan. 

33
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,410
 Nice to meet you. 

34
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,630
 - Yeon Seo! 
 - Mr. Jo! 

35
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:44,810
 How was my performance? 

36
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,370
 Oh, you were the best! 

37
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:50,010
 I'm relieved because you said that I was the best. 

38
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:54,300
 The Grand Prize! Wow! 

39
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:05,430
It's because you have a scar on your heart right now. You were always a shining star.

40
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:11,420
No matter what anyone says, even though you yourself may deny it, you're an angel-like person.

41
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,700
Just one more time,

42
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:19,900
I'd like to see you shining bright like you did back then.

43
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,900
 That rude guy. 

44
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,880
Sleep tight.

45
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:57,030
 Where is it? Where did it go? 

46
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:19,470
So annoying! Ugh, I'm so annoyed!!

47
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,870
♫   One, two, a 1,2,3,4... hmm hmm ♫

48
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,240
 Wait a second. Why am I being so cautious? 

49
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,670
♫  I will never forget ♫

50
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:53,040
♫  The way you rescued me from  ♫

51
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,650
♫  summer heat with ice  ♫

52
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:00,220
♫  as cool as the sea. Yeah, I  ♫

53
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,870
♫  will drown all day if  ♫

54
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,360
♫   you stay with me  ♫

55
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,850
♫  Ohh, wouldn't it be better  ♫

56
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,960
Wait. What's happening?

57
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,730
♫  could decide to stick together  ♫

58
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,260
Did it get stuck?

59
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:22,660
♫  Something sweeter. Oh, oh, oh  ♫

60
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:26,290
♫  Something to show, show that you love me  ♫

61
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:33,160
♫  I want something sweeter. You see  ♫

62
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,700
♫  Something to show, show that you love me  ♫

63
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:42,300
♫  We... We decide to stick together  ♫

64
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:49,100
♫  You need something sweeter. Oh, oh, oh  ♫

65
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,730
♫  Something to show, show that you love me  ♫

66
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:59,720
♫  I want something sweeter. You see...  ♫

67
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:04,990
♫  Something to show, show that you love me  ♫

68
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,830
Mr. Jo needs to go out today,

69
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:12,530
so we'll need a temporary secretary to take care of the young lady for today. Would anyone like to volunteer?

70
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:16,260
No one? We're offering a 100% bonus and one week of leave!

71
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,890
With whose permission?

72
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:30,690
That designer dress with your curled eyelashes.

73
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:34,000
This means that you're attending the Fantasia event, right?

74
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:39,760
The makeup looks good. You'll look much prettier than Ni Na.

75
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:44,260
I was always prettier than her. As if you didn't know that already.

76
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,430
Will you be all right?

77
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,980
Let's go.

78
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:14,290
This time they will perform "Swan Lake" at the party.

79
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:18,470
Don't even think about it. I won't sit in front of the stage like a fool.

80
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:22,150
But you can feel it. You know what the story is about.

81
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,090
That's why I don—

82
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,850
It's hurtful. Do I really have to explain it to you?

83
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,550
She's rude as always.

84
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,140
Where is my handkerchief?!

85
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:44,300
Since you've made up your mind to attend the party,  you might as well show them that you're the owner of Fantasia.

86
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,730
I'm not interested in that.

87
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,470
You can have everything. I'll sign the documents.

88
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,810
Oh my god, are you certified to be angry?

89
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:55,300
Did she get a certificate for being rude?

90
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,950
Then, why are you going?

91
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,270
- Yeon Seo. 
- Stop talking to me. You're too loud.

92
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,670
Blessed are those who have patience.

93
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,630
This foolish girl may be blind right now,

94
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:22,660
but one day she will know how you truly feel.

95
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:27,730
She will cry and regret her past actions.

96
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,190
Give it back. Where is it?

97
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,070
Yeon Seo!

98
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,260
Great news. My niece has come!

99
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,500
These people are in a lot of trouble.

100
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,340
This girl has no patience for rudeness.

101
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,290
 Watch out for that cane. 

102
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,530
You've been doing well all this while?

103
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:26,000
Of course, of course! We've been wanting to see you so badly, we practically cried.

104
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,660
To come all the way here, after not even showing your face for three years,

105
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,260
your parents up in Heaven would be so proud.

106
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:36,630
This works out well! The guests today are particularly discerning people.

107
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:39,570
They've always wanted to see you in person.

108
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:44,540
You can just stay still. That'll be better since you're pretty. It will seem more dramatic.

109
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:49,670
Rich people open their wallets out of pity and make themselves feel superior.

110
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,470
Mom, you should stop.

111
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,340
Yeon Seo, please try to understand.

112
00:09:55,340 --> 00:10:00,560
These days, our ballet company leader is only thinking about patronage whether she is asleep or awake.

113
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,490
Roo Na Unni.

114
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,190
You remember my voice.

115
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,360
Good job.

116
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:13,280
Let's go in. Gosh, Ni Na must be so happy.

117
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,260
She used to cry twelve times a day because she missed you so much.

118
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:20,250
Come, let's go in.

119
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,240
Ni Na, good luck!

120
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,960
Do well.

121
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,890
You're the best. You're Fantasia's one and only prima ballerina,

122
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,540
Geum Nina.

123
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,800
You are the star of the show.

124
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,560
-  It's actually her. 
 - Oh, really? 

125
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,320
 Wow, she's really blind. 

126
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,140
  It wasn't a rumor that she was blind. 

127
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,980
  Oh, poor girl. 

128
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,260
Would you like to wait in the car?

129
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,270
I need to go to the restroom.

130
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,180
- It's on the left. 
 - I'll go by myself. It's just around the corner.

131
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,950
You can go in.

132
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,040
Ah, my handkerchief.

133
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:17,140
  What? Lee Yeon Seo has come? 

134
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:20,460
  - You saw her? 
- Don't address her informally. 

135
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,180
  She was once my idol.  

136
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,560
 Call her Yeon Seo Unni. 

137
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,670
 But she can't see at all. I don't know why she came. 

138
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,700
  She's bad luck. 

139
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,930
 - The performance will start soon.  
 - Quick, let's go. 
 - Yes.

140
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:38,450
  Please make your way to the theater. 

141
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:48,240


142
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:23,740
Yeon Seo.

143
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:26,840
Yeon Se—

144
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,520
Good evening.  (French)

145
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:35,060
Have you been well, Sir?

146
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:39,260
I hope you have been well, too, Odette. You get prettier every year.

147
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:44,890
- Good evening! 
 - Hello, Sir.

148
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:50,190
Where is the real Odette?

149
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:53,360
I've been searching for her but she's nowhere to be seen.

150
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,640
She'll be here soon.

151
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,990
It's been three years, you know.

152
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,530
Yeon Seo!

153
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,960
Why isn't she coming? The ceremony is going to start.

154
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,910
 Please raise your glasses, everyone. 

155
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:14,040
- What do we do? 
  - To celebrate the 20th anniversary of Fantasia Cultural Foundation, 

156
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,380
 we have invited a special guest. 

157
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,560
The invited director...

158
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:21,270
Hey, make him stop talking.

159
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:24,690
We have invited Ms. Lee Yeon Seo.

160
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:27,140
Please welcome her.

161
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,620
It's been three years.

162
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:32,900
 The daughter of Fantasia, the Madonna of Fantasia, Ms. Lee Yeon Seo.  

163
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,990
 Where are you? 

164
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:33,070
Hello, I'm Lee Yeon Seo.

165
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,180
Today is a special day for me.

166
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:40,440
The day of Fantasia's 20th anniversary also happens to fall on the anniversary of my parents' death.

167
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:46,340
I was pondering on how I should grace this event with my presence.

168
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:50,010
Should I show up as a corpse, having hung myself in the bathroom?

169
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:53,050
You know, to be "dramatic."

170
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:58,290
I suppose all of you are looking upon me with pity, right?

171
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:02,700
As much as I am pitiable, as much as I am deserving,

172
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,700
I hope for as much support.

173
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:13,760
As you know, when I was the solo principle dancer here,

174
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,070
our Geum Ni Na was my understudy; my shadow.

175
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:21,920
If I were to fall ill, or fall in love and run away,

176
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,700
she was the one who would be on stage in my stead.

177
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,150
Unfortunately, I was just too healthy

178
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:33,050
and ballet was my entire world, so I was never once absent.

179
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:35,820
But once the sun sets, the moon will rise.

180
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:41,040
My eyes have become like this, and Ni Na rose to the top of the pack.

181
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,530
While I was living in darkness for the past three years,

182
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:47,060
Ni Na has shone brightly as Fantasia's prima ballerina.

183
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:51,110
What a dramatic story this is.

184
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:55,690
As funny as this story may seem,

185
00:19:55,690 --> 00:20:01,060
please give as much support to the Fantasia ballet company.

186
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,370
My toast has gone a bit long.

187
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:15,350
Have fun today, since no one knows what tomorrow will bring!

188
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:26,030
Let go! Let go of me, I said!

189
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:31,220
- Director!
 - You went too far!

190
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,380
Let go of me.

191
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,320
You always were a piece of work.

192
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,180
I knew you were a spoiled princess who got to do whatever she wanted.

193
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,850
But this is too much.

194
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:46,030
You should have braced yourself if you planned on setting this event on the anniversary of my parent's death.

195
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,190
The people in there right now

196
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:53,250
are Korea's one-percenters. For them, each minute and each second are worth gold.

197
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,760
Do you think it was easy accommodating all those busy peoples' schedules?!

198
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,000
Laught—

199
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,110
You! In light of this incident, let's be honest.

200
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:07,530
When have we ever done you wrong?

201
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:10,690
What grudge do you have against us for you to ruin this event?

202
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:12,650
You smiled!

203
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,200
You smiled, that day.

204
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,960
 Oh no, what to do! Yeon Seo! 

205
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,120
 Yeon Seo! 

206
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:37,550
Oh my.

207
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,300
Wow, look at this girl.

208
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,750
I... am your aunt.

209
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,020
Sure, you could say...

210
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:51,500
Well, you can say we're distant cousins,

211
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,700
but we're still family!

212
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:58,090
There's a degree to which you can slander another person.

213
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:02,180
I thought it was just your eyes that had grown dim, but did something go wrong with your head as well?

214
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,580
That's enough.

215
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:10,040
- And if I don't want to? 
- Then this will turn into even more of a commotion.

216
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:17,660
Let's go.

217
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:58,240
♫  It's all right, it's all right.  ♫

218
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:06,300
♫  Even if you lost everything  ♫

219
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:12,910
♫  It's all right, it's all right.  ♫

220
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:21,050
♫  Because someone is by my side  ♫

221
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:26,080
♫  Even when I'm crying  ♫

222
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,640
♫  or feeling lonely,  ♫

223
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:35,570
♫  the one who stays by my side,  ♫

224
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:39,290
♫  you  ♫

225
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:43,780
♫  You are my angel  ♫

226
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:49,060
♫  Oh, you are my angel always  ♫

227
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,470
♫  You're here  ♫

228
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:54,550
 Oh, foolish person. 

229
00:23:54,550 --> 00:24:01,210
 As the beautiful dancing of your feet melted away the sin of the tongue with ugly words, 

230
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:04,380
 you should give thanks to the one who gave you those talents. 

231
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,380
♫  Always,  ♫

232
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,840
♫  Stay here forever  ♫

233
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:17,790
♫  Even if it is a love that cannot be accomplished   ♫

234
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:24,660
♫  Don't be afraid. Leave everything to me  ♫

235
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:28,300
♫  Even if the world says no,  ♫

236
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:32,490
♫  I will discover the way with you  ♫

237
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:37,920
♫  Our fate is to be together, let's get back up together  ♫

238
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,820
It looks like the sun is setting.

239
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:43,430
The sunset is pretty.

240
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:44,900
♫  Oh, you're by my side  ♫

241
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,530
It's quite beautiful.

242
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:50,180
♫  Always  ♫

243
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:53,840
♫  Always, stay here forever  ♫

244
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,470
Let's slowly start preparing.

245
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,650
You can start your rehabilitation as well as foundatio—

246
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:59,610
Stop it.

247
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:00,570
Yeon Seo.

248
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:02,890
I told you not to call me like that!?

249
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:06,870
I hate everything! I hate ballet, I hate the foundation, I hate everything!

250
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:09,980
So, don't tell me to do this and that!

251
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,450
Lee Yeon Seo!

252
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:21,630
Did you... just yell at me?

253
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:25,290
Get your head on straight. You're at the heart of a battlefield now.

254
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,610
Do you know how many guns are aimed at your heart?

255
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:30,490
I may not know how many, but I wish it would be a single shot that does me in, cleanly.

256
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:33,900
Stop talking about dying, too.

257
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,420
It's all done now.

258
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:42,400
If you just give me a little more time, I will help you get back to your place.

259
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,090
My place? How? Will you give me back my eyes?

260
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:47,990
Yeon Seo—

261
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:51,180
Get my place back? Says who? Who are you to decide?

262
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:56,060
If you act like my father once more, I'll actually fire you.

263
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:41,160
Mr. Jo?

264
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,850
Yeon Seo!

265
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:53,920
Yeon Seo! Hold tight!

266
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,760
What is it? What's going on?

267
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,450
Yeon Seo!

268
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,410
Oh, I might be late.

269
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,760
 Mister... 

270
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:06,630
 Mister, 

271
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,940
 can you hear me? 

272
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:13,060
Mister!

273
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:35,530
Is anyone there?

274
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:40,970
Please help us.

275
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:46,920
Who knew these flowers would come to use (for a funeral)?

276
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:05,240
Rest in peace.

277
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,170
Who's there?

278
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:18,860
There's... There's someone out there.

279
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:21,880
Here!

280
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,330
There are people in here!

281
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:29,850
Please... Please help us.

282
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:31,930
Please.

283
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:36,480
You... Who are you?

284
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,380
Are you a human or an animal?

285
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:43,400
You horrible bastard!

286
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,360
Do you not have a conscience?

287
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:50,280
Are you just going to stand there? At least call for help!

288
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,850
Mister...

289
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:57,190
Sir... Hey, whoever it is, please...

290
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:00,680
Why can I hear her voice so clearly?!

291
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,280
 Help us. 

292
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,130
 I-I can't. 

293
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:24,040
 If I interfere in a human's life, I'll be in big trouble. 

294
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:28,290
 Please... save me. 

295
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:32,190
 I can't. I don't have the time. I have to go! 

296
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:34,800
 I want to live. 

297
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:39,360
 I've been wanting to die every day, 

298
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,850
 but now I find I want to live. 

299
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:44,130
 I want to live! 

300
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:51,160
 I've been wanting to die every day, 

301
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,200
 but now I find I want to live. 

302
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:15,490


303
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:28,340
♫  Just stay here. Stay by my side  ♫

304
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,060
♫   I'll be here  ♫

305
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,870
♫  I'll stay  ♫

306
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:42,980
 I shouldn't have done it. 

307
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:48,560
 It was something I shouldn't have done. 

308
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:57,530
♫   Just stay, stay with me ♫ 

309
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,580
♫  I'm here ♫ 

310
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:12,430
♫  Just stay, stay by my side ♫ 

311
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,610
♫   I'm here ♫ 

312
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:20,920
   

313
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,860
 Like wind, 

314
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,970
 like dust... 

315
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:28,420
 Someone's out there, right? 

316
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:31,210
 Did you have a dream, Miss? 

317
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:35,480
 If you succeed in your special mission within 100 days, the doors will open for you once more.

 Hello, I'm Kim Dan. I'm here for an interview. 

319
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,720
 My first step to getting close to her. 

320
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,420
 Why does a secretary have to learn this?! 

321
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,540
 Clear it all away. 

322
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:47,620
 What is it that I have to do? 

323
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,440
 Love. 

324
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:51,190
 I must make her love someone. 

325
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:53,347
♫   Just stay ♫
