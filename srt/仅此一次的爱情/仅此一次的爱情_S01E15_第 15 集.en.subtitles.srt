1
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:47,255
You like fairness, don't you?

2
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:50,467
You take one thing

3
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:52,844
and give another.

4
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,389
Right?

5
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,778
If I must kill someone

6
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,281
for the sake of the one I wish to save,

7
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:16,618
then I will

8
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,371
gladly commit that sin.

9
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,125
Take everything from me.

10
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,503
Anything.

11
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,715
I can give it to you gladly.

12
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,094
LEE YEON-SEO AND KIM DAN

13
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:40,683
If you do not exist in this world,
do you think he would want to live?

14
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,644
That's not a reward. It's a punishment.

15
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,187
Live on.

16
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:47,315
Do that and stay by her side.

17
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,867
CONTACTS

18
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:58,827
LEE YEON-SEO

19
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,419
SECRETARY KIM DAN

20
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,797
You're actually worried
after you dropped the bomb?

21
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,593
You need to stop barging into my house.

22
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,847
Where are they, and what are they doing?

23
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:20,431
Did you

24
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,017
meet her?

25
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:28,940
Listen carefully

26
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,025
to what I'm about to tell you.

27
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,127
Her fate was to be killed by the wicked.

28
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:51,838
Are you

29
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,674
really going to kill me?

30
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:59,804
No, I cannot accept that.

31
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:03,224
I'll change it.

32
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:04,809
Why?

33
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:06,519
Why are you doing this?

34
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,057
I told you to stay away from evil!

35
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:27,475
You must not meddle in human lives.

36
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:31,104
If you have blood on your hands,
you'll never be forgiven.

37
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,313
You will dissipate immediately!

38
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:35,024
In order to save her, I need to get rid of
those who are trying to kill her.

39
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,318
That's the only way to change her fate!

40
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,444
Kim Dan!

41
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,840
Either way, I'll be dissipated.

42
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,467
If that's the case,

43
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,594
I'm going to save her first.

44
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:09,702
Hu.

45
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:14,707
You told me not to do it.

46
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,918
You said not to harm humans...

47
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:37,647
I told you before

48
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:39,941
that you changed me.

49
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:44,821
Hu.

50
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,325
I've lived such a long life

51
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,995
that I cannot even remember
how long I have lived.

52
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,582
I've met countless humans

53
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,877
and just as many angels as well.

54
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:05,591
I was always a stranger and an onlooker.

55
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,720
I barely felt any emotions.

56
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,475
But you

57
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,895
completely turned me upside down.

58
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:20,356
Whenever I saw you,

59
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:22,191
I felt angry,

60
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:23,860
anxious,

61
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:26,320
and suffocated.

62
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,031
Hu.

63
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:40,168
Don't do this. Please don't.
You can't do this!

64
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,173
Nevertheless, Dan, I liked you.

65
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,384
You are

66
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,178
a lifesaver.

67
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:54,223
Even if you caused trouble,
you saved the animals

68
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,726
and protected the weak.

69
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,354
You were always pure

70
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,317
and optimistic.

71
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,989
I wanted to return to paradise with you.

72
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:14,994
Hu.

73
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,331
No, Hu...

74
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:20,500
Dan.

75
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,211
Never change who you are.

76
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:25,838
Go

77
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,090
and save Yeon-seo.

78
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,175
Hu.

79
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,301
Hu!

80
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:31,761
Hu!

81
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,005
Yeon-seo!

82
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,139
-Let me go.
-No.

83
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,766
Let me go!

84
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,146
Yeon-seo.

85
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:26,816
Is this why

86
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:29,902
you wanted to marry me?

87
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,698
Did you make me promise you
at the columbarium

88
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,075
and practiced with Ni-na alone

89
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,035
because

90
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:40,454
you were preparing yourself?

91
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,498
I can do anything to save you.

92
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,958
How can I live without you?

93
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,793
Then did you expect me to sit and watch?

94
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,296
When I knew I could save you?

95
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,881
When I knew there is a way for you
to not dissipate?

96
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,887
What about after you die?

97
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,307
What about after that?

98
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,143
Kim Dan.

99
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:08,274
How am I to live

100
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,196
without you?

101
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,036
Dan.

102
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,335
I'm here.

103
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:30,671
It's all right.

104
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,256
Hold on. Please.

105
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:35,176
Don't die.

106
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,433
I can't let you die

107
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:47,772
because of me.

108
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,165
Dan.

109
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:10,795
Dan?

110
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,840
Dan.

111
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,094
Please. No.

112
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:21,138
Please Dan, please.

113
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,849
Please don't do this.

114
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:27,812
Dan, get up. Dan. No

115
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:33,067
Please, Dan. Please wake up!

116
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,405
No, Dan! Please.

117
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:41,951
Don't do this to me! Please don't!

118
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,452
Dan! No!

119
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:46,747
Dan! No!

120
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,084
No! Dan!

121
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,224
What happened to you?

122
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,436
Where did you go?

123
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,772
Who did this to you?

124
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:39,467
Yeon-seo.

125
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,307
How did you know I was here?

126
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,100
Wait, no.

127
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,979
What on earth happened to Dan?

128
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,483
Tell me everything you know.
Every single detail.

129
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,109
I think he was trying

130
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,528
to get rid of Keum Ru-na.

131
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:03,574
Because of me?

132
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:05,910
Because she might try to harm me again?

133
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:08,996
What are you guys doing?

134
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,248
Is life and death a joke to you?

135
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,459
I went to the church.

136
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,920
I heard someone was transported
to a hospital.

137
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,755
The floor was covered
with blood and the pills.

138
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,299
I was scared to death in case something

139
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,301
might have happened to you.

140
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:26,847
Unfortunately,

141
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,183
I'm perfectly fine.

142
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,185
I'll get going.

143
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,229
Both of you are fools.

144
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,731
You're awfully stupid and awfully selfish.

145
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:38,400
Don't you dare judge us.

146
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,152
Do you know

147
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,863
how hard it was for us
to make this decision?

148
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:43,948
You're running away

149
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:45,908
because you don't want to be left alone.

150
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,411
That's not a noble act.

151
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,913
Don't fool yourself.

152
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,042
Why are things so complicated?

153
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:56,919
A noble act?

154
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,546
I don't need that.

155
00:13:58,837 --> 00:13:59,964
I'm running away, you say?

156
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,340
What's wrong with that?

157
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,133
If I can save him,

158
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,302
I don't care if I become
a coward or a lowlife.

159
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,140
I am not going to perform.

160
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:11,934
Put on the show without me.

161
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,105
We have two days left until the show.

162
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,566
Tomorrow, the day after tomorrow,
and the day after that.

163
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,863
That's how much time Dan has left.

164
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:27,241
He only has three days left.

165
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,327
I can't perform on stage.

166
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:31,704
I won't.

167
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:34,540
I won't stay away from Dan
even for a second.

168
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,001
That's my final say.

169
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,434
Dan!

170
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:55,436
When did you wake up?

171
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,605
What about your wounds?
Are you all right? Are you in pain?

172
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,336
Why won't you perform?

173
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,505
I don't need to. It's a waste of time.

174
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,182
Do it.

175
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:34,683
I don't want to.

176
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,352
Do the show.

177
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,355
-I don't want to.
-I came this far, so you could dance

178
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,524
and live your life.

179
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,027
If you give up on that,

180
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,113
what have I done all this time?

181
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,406
You want me to live?

182
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,327
Is that why you tried to kill Ru-na?

183
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,245
Is that how you hurt yourself?

184
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,957
You tried to kill someone

185
00:15:58,666 --> 00:15:59,833
to save me.

186
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:03,003
And you were ready
to be dissipated on that spot.

187
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,215
-Yeon-seo.
-Jerk.

188
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,885
Did you think I would be moved?

189
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,720
I'm not grateful at all!

190
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,556
No, if you disappeared after that,

191
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,725
I would have lived my whole life
resenting you.

192
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,435
I would've hated you

193
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,688
for disappearing and throwing away
the time we had left,

194
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,606
even if it was only for a day or two.

195
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,191
Look who's talking.

196
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:25,693
You were going to die too.

197
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:28,153
How could you?
How could you give away your life?

198
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,990
So what if I become a human after you die?

199
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:32,950
Did you think I'd be grateful?

200
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,326
This happened because of me.

201
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,538
You're in this mess because you saved me.

202
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,915
Because I wanted to live...

203
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,877
Because I said I wanted to live,
you have to disappear.

204
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,629
It's all because of me.

205
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,757
This is why I have to save you.

206
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,468
No.

207
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,140
I thought it had to be you.

208
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:59,101
If only one of us could live,

209
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,980
I thought it had to be you.

210
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,733
You've never had a life.

211
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,360
You didn't get to grow up.

212
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,239
The one who should be living
a happy and healthy life...

213
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:15,868
Dan,

214
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,995
it should be you.

215
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,290
I really want you to have that life.

216
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,670
Do you know how scared I was?

217
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,173
I thought that you were going
to die in my arms.

218
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:31,008
I was scared to death.

219
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,427
Don't die.

220
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,012
Please don't leave.

221
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,099
Don't disappear.

222
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,560
How could I live a happy life?

223
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:44,354
How could I live a healthy life?

224
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,025
Hu left me just like that.

225
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,277
And if you also die because of me,

226
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,737
how am I supposed to live?

227
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:56,742
What happened to Hu?

228
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,454
What happened to him?

229
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,623
No...

230
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,834
Dan, how could...

231
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:09,296
No. How could that...

232
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,356
It might be completely empty.

233
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,150
Since Hu isn't here anymore,

234
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,236
that room could have disappeared too.

235
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:35,489
Wait here for me.

236
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:36,740
Let me go in and check.

237
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:38,617
Let me come with you.

238
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,416
Let's stay together.

239
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:48,979
What's this?

240
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:54,902
A report.

241
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,825
ARCHANGEL HU

242
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:05,329
I never thought
I would ever write my last report.

243
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,584
When was the first time
I went against Your will

244
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:11,960
and disobeyed You?

245
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,464
Isn't it amazing? The cuteness of babies.

246
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,674
The more I crossed the line,

247
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,594
the more I began to question.

248
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,263
Angels are meant to be only bystanders.

249
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,224
If I can save her, I should.

250
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:26,600
That's a good deed.

251
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,310
And that's our job.

252
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,733
I will never be able to

253
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:37,611
understand Your grand plan
for Dan and her.

254
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,031
However, what I know for certain

255
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:45,160
is that they have earned their right.

256
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,205
They are struggling now.

257
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,833
Please. I ask that you give them a chance.

258
00:20:54,962 --> 00:21:00,759
ARCHANGEL HU

259
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:13,981
REPORT

260
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:31,748
Hu.

261
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,670
I really liked you too.

262
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,258
I wanted to become

263
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:45,053
an angel like you.

264
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,056
Even to the end,

265
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:52,019
you are truly admirable.

266
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:56,982
I'm no match for you.

267
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:07,367
I won't forget you.

268
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:10,454
Never.

269
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:23,967
Thank you.

270
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,505
Hu gave us

271
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:05,717
time as a gift.

272
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:13,725
We both wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for him.

273
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:21,983
Let's make every moment count.

274
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:25,320
Let's not get sick or die.

275
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,198
Let us be happy.

276
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:08,864
It's because of him.

277
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:12,033
Everything became a mess
after he showed up.

278
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:15,370
I won't let him live.

279
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:24,671
NI-NA

280
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:28,842
Ru-na, where are you?

281
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,052
I thought you wanted me to ignore you.

282
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,137
Why?

283
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,014
I was wondering if you're okay.

284
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,200
Ni-na.

285
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,206
Ru-na.

286
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:01,333
I'm sorry.

287
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,799
Ms. Keum Ru-na.
You're under arrest for murder,

288
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:12,469
attempted murder,
obstruction of business, and assault.

289
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:14,971
Keum Ni-na.

290
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:16,556
You...

291
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:17,807
Take her away.

292
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,238
-Anything in there?
-Yes.

293
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:47,504
Do not leave your residence
and be on standby.

294
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:48,755
Do you understand?

295
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,605
Yeong-ja, don't be like this.

296
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,317
I did so many wrong things.

297
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:11,569
It's my fault.

298
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:13,947
My greed

299
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:16,741
and covetousness

300
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,911
ruined my daughter.

301
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,915
What am I going to do? What will I do?

302
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:27,711
She was caught.

303
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,754
Keum Ru-na was arrested.

304
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,048
-When?
-Detective Ko just called me.

305
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:35,135
It's all finished. Everything is resolved.

306
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:36,845
There wasn't enough evidence.

307
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,973
I thought it'd be hard to get her
after Uncle Ki-chun took the blame.

308
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,976
Ru-na's minion, Ki Jun-su,

309
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,186
is dead.

310
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:48,023
And they found everything on his phone.

311
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:50,483
There was proof that he threatened
and controlled Moon Ji-ung,

312
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,068
and that he had a connection with Ru-na.

313
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:55,071
He has done all the dirty work
all alone for years.

314
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:56,740
Was he not scared that
he would get punished?

315
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,783
He was punished by fate.

316
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,494
No, someone punished him.

317
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,331
This is great.

318
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:07,292
You can solely focus on
your performance now.

319
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,337
Ms. Jung, I...

320
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,176
It's Director Ji.

321
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:22,849
Let us go and practice.

322
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,769
I thought I made myself clear
that I do not want to.

323
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:29,439
It's a shame that I have
to waste my time on you right now.

324
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:30,940
-So--
-Even after Dan leaves,

325
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,108
you will have to live on.

326
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,318
Watch your mouth.

327
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:34,527
He's right.

328
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:36,905
Dan...

329
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:39,532
I want that more than anyone.

330
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:43,036
For you to live on even after I leave.

331
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:48,041
Can't you think of this performance
as the last opportunity for you two?

332
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:52,253
It's the final chance for your love
to be heard in paradise.

333
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:55,256
What do you mean?

334
00:27:55,924 --> 00:28:00,095
At first, I thought I could die
in peace after creating

335
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,972
the perfect performance
that Seol-hui dreamed of.

336
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,893
That was my will,
and I wanted the deity to know.

337
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:10,021
That's why I was
even more obsessed about it.

338
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,399
I wanted to die that desperately,

339
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,068
but now I want to live.

340
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,821
This happened to someone like me.

341
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:20,824
So please don't give up.

342
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:21,950
A miracle

343
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:24,577
may happen.

344
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,506
Listen carefully
to what I'm about to tell you.

345
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,929
Those two foolish ones
finally chose to risk their lives.

346
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:45,932
Where are they?

347
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,310
You still feel guilty, don't you?

348
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:52,939
Thinking that it's all your fault
how she died and you couldn't die.

349
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,032
You need to do something
to let someone live.

350
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:05,827
Help Yeon-seo to live on.

351
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:09,998
That's the only way
your soul will find peace.

352
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,102
We can't be sure about this.

353
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:34,272
How should I dance?
What does it mean to perform well?

354
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:36,900
Then what will happen?

355
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,198
Let's go.

356
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,492
To where?

357
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,203
Okay, right here.

358
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,039
Take a seat.

359
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,004
This is really the Tree of Prophecy?

360
00:29:58,379 --> 00:29:59,297
Yes.

361
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,342
It helps you decide where to go
at the right time and moment.

362
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,387
Unbelievable. Waiting for a prophecy
when we're at a dead end?

363
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:11,351
Hey, there it is.

364
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,735
Is something written on it?

365
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:32,997
Here.

366
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:41,172
"July 11, Fantasia Ballet Theater"?

367
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,050
You really are like a cult member now.

368
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,469
Can you just do it for me

369
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,388
without a prophecy or a sign?

370
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:51,808
I've never seen
an official performance of yours.

371
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:54,727
I want to see you jumping, twirling,

372
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,896
smiling, and crying on the stage.

373
00:30:58,147 --> 00:31:00,567
Two days will fly by
if I practice and perform the show.

374
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:02,944
Wouldn't that be

375
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,029
such a waste of time?

376
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:07,991
Not at all.

377
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:12,036
But come to think of it,
your dance marked our beginning.

378
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,246
The rainbow dance.

379
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,083
And your dance will mark our end as well.
It's perfect.

380
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,168
Don't say that it's the end.

381
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,337
Nothing's over yet.

382
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,007
-Let's go.
-You'll do it, right?

383
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,175
You'll perform Giselle, right?

384
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:28,970
I need to think about it.

385
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,848
Didn't you say that
we were running out of time?

386
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,864
REPORT

387
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,299
What are you doing?

388
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,387
I was about to write in my diary
since it's been a long time.

389
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:17,352
Don't bother.

390
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,314
I wrote so many reports,
begging Him to turn me into a human.

391
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:23,149
But He set all my reports ablaze.

392
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:26,611
My gosh, that guy is...

393
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,780
No, that deity is unbelievable.

394
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,449
He's the most ill-tempered being
in the world.

395
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,077
If He wasn't going to read it,
why did He allow you to write anything?

396
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,037
Does He think this is funny?

397
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:39,749
That's why you don't need to
write anything.

398
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:42,293
You don't have to put anything at stake.

399
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,213
What a pity.

400
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,632
Since I'll be dancing,
I was ready to bet on something.

401
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:53,096
I'm most confident about dancing.

402
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,975
Are you going to perform?

403
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:01,104
Seriously?

404
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:02,230
Yes.

405
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:04,023
Really?

406
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:06,609
You made the right choice!

407
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:11,155
It's going to be so beautiful.
You'll do a terrific job.

408
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:13,658
How are you so amazing?

409
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:15,201
-Are you that happy?
-What? Of course.

410
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,972
Ms. Keum hanged herself with a blanket.

411
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:38,307
What? Call an ambulance!

412
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:39,392
Yes, sir.

413
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:01,247
It's great to see you all here.

414
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,541
We'll start the rehearsal
after warming up.

415
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,272
It's finally happening tomorrow.

416
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:28,983
You're right.

417
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:33,696
Our last night is approaching.

418
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:35,948
I thought

419
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:38,284
it would last forever.

420
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:43,706
You're practically speaking like a human.

421
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:46,375
Is that right?

422
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:49,378
Do you remember

423
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:52,131
getting drunk and ranting at me?

424
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:56,135
That happened ages ago.

425
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:59,222
Imagine how upset I must've been
after getting fired by you

426
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:01,224
to have drunk alcohol
when I can't even drink well.

427
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,853
For me, I think it was since that day.

428
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:08,731
The moment you handed me your handkerchief

429
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:11,025
and told me to imagine that it was you.

430
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,904
I think that's when I started to like you.

431
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,783
I danced with you back then
only because I was drunk.

432
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,369
Thinking back, I was quite bold

433
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:23,162
to have danced with you.

434
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,503
Let's relive that moment.

435
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:36,884
Imagine that it's our first time
dancing together.

436
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:39,178
What?

437
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:36,027
JULY 11, FANTASIA BALLET THEATER

438
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,877
The day we've been waiting
for is finally here.

439
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:58,299
Shall we, Ms. Lee?

440
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:15,191
I'll be back.

441
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,405
I'll be back too.

442
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:35,670
JULY 11-12, 2019
FANTASIA GRAND THEATER

443
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:44,470
2019 FANTASIA'S REGULAR PERFORMANCE

444
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,605
Excuse me for a second.

445
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,035
Thank you.

446
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,287
You look beautiful.

447
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:12,873
You truly look like Giselle
who has just woken up from her grave.

448
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:15,209
I hope you enjoy our show tonight.

449
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:16,752
The VIP seats are vacant.

450
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:19,547
The Chairman, General Director,
and Associate Director are all absent,

451
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,090
so I'll be watching it alone.

452
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,092
It'll be a pleasant environment for you.

453
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:25,094
Our ballet theater will get back
on its feet soon.

454
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:26,470
Thank you for your patience.

455
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,389
I'll be looking forward to it.

456
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:29,765
I hope you keep your promise

457
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:31,642
about how you'll make us
fall in love with ballet.

458
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:32,810
I'm going to

459
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,521
impress both you and the deity above.

460
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:37,273
I'm confident.

461
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,358
I thought you'd be downcast.

462
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,194
You're incredible.

463
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:47,491
I know this face.

464
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,202
Aren't you her secretary
who popped up everywhere

465
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:51,412
like Superman?

466
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:53,622
I'm her husband.

467
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:56,500
What?

468
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:59,003
Whose? Her husband?

469
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,298
We got married last week.

470
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,676
I'm sure you all know already,

471
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,512
but let me introduce him
since you'll be seeing more of him.

472
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:09,680
This is my husband.

473
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,558
Good luck tonight.

474
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,268
He's amazing.

475
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:15,895
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

476
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:18,230
Congratulations!

477
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,118
Good job, everyone.

478
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:32,912
Before our show,

479
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,373
could our prima ballerina say a few words?

480
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:36,999
-That's okay.
-Huddle.

481
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:57,103
I thought

482
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,397
I came second to none in this world.

483
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:03,526
To be honest, I even wondered at times

484
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:05,569
if the deity loved me too much

485
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:07,488
and gave me everything.

486
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:10,699
I had no idea that those were
all delusions and meaningless.

487
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:13,244
I've been waiting so long for this show.

488
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:16,414
And I'm truly honored
to take part of it with you all.

489
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:21,293
Today, I'm going to dance until I drop.

490
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,338
Let's make this performance

491
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:26,882
beautiful.

492
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:30,302
Fantasia. Giselle.

493
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,096
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

494
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,436
-Good luck, Yeon-seo!
-You too.

495
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,860
She is seriously

496
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:48,362
the most beautiful, isn't she?

497
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,323
You're crazy about her.

498
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:56,495
Sure. Her beauty is enough
to make you stop breathing.

499
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,330
Our dear, Ms. Lee.

500
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,585
Thank you, Ms. Jung.

501
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:05,254
Why are you thanking me all of a sudden?

502
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,800
If Yeon-seo had a guardian angel,

503
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:11,510
it's probably you.

504
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:15,514
I hope you can continue
to take good care of her.

505
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:18,350
Gosh, you're making me cringe.

506
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:24,190
Be good to her
just like you've been doing so far.

507
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,734
If you make her cry or break her heart,

508
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,319
you'll have to deal with me.

509
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:31,155
Okay.

510
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:54,011
Good luck. I'll be looking forward
to your dance.

511
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:56,388
I heard you helped the police

512
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:58,057
arrest Ru-na.

513
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,769
Where did you hear that?

514
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:03,979
Are you all right?

515
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:08,817
It's hard.

516
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:11,445
But I have to overcome it.

517
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:13,405
Ru-na, my mom, and I should

518
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:15,616
face proper punishment.

519
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:18,577
Thank you.

520
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:48,357
Watch me.

521
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:51,360
I'll show you the most
beautiful Giselle in the world.

522
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:06,584
Sir!

523
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:36,614
Hold on.

524
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:37,573
I'm in stage management.

525
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:39,366
You're late.

526
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:40,492
Sorry.

527
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:08,956
What's going on? Why are you here now?

528
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:10,958
Slow down, Ni-na.

529
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:12,543
Did you run away?

530
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:14,753
You could say that.

531
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,672
Why? What are you plotting now?

532
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:19,133
It hurt my pride.

533
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,385
It's all because of one person.

534
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,595
I'm in this colossal mess
because of that person.

535
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:25,431
I ought to return the favor.

536
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:27,599
Who?

537
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:29,476
Yeon-seo?

538
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:31,019
Are you going after Yeon-seo again?

539
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:33,397
I told you that I didn't want you
to do this for me.

540
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,277
It's not Yeon-seo. It's that guy.

541
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,155
I realized this recently.

542
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:45,242
Losing the thing you cherish the most

543
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:47,619
can be infuriating and drive you to rage.

544
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:50,914
Yeon-seo should also feel what I felt.

545
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,001
Stop it, Ru-na.

546
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:56,462
Please turn yourself in! I'm begging you.

547
00:45:57,921 --> 00:45:59,047
Watch.

548
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:00,632
Tomorrow,

549
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:02,801
you'll be Giselle.

550
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:07,473
If you don't want to,
report me to the police again.

551
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:39,124
Keum Ru-na is here now?

552
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:42,419
I already called the police.

553
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:43,920
They are on their way here.

554
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:45,756
Thank you, Ni-na.

555
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:47,132
But

556
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,427
something was off about her.

557
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:52,304
She said

558
00:48:52,929 --> 00:48:54,848
that she was after you, not Yeon-seo.

559
00:48:58,310 --> 00:48:59,311
Be careful.

560
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:16,828
Ni-na.

561
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:19,915
Did something happen?
Why are you so nervous?

562
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:21,708
What?

563
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:25,003
I'm glad

564
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:26,588
that it's me, not Yeon-seo.

565
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:30,550
Ni-na, please don't say
anything to Yeon-seo.

566
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:32,928
-But still--
-I'll catch her.

567
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:34,346
I'll handle it quietly.

568
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:37,015
Help Yeon-seo just focus on the show.

569
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:39,643
Please do this for me.

570
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:43,146
Nothing.

571
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:44,940
It's nothing.

572
00:49:57,786 --> 00:49:58,787
Yeon-seo.

573
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:02,958
Did you like the show?

574
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:04,918
How was it?

575
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:08,255
It was the best.

576
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:10,132
Act Two will be even better.

577
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:11,383
Enjoy it.

578
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:12,759
Okay.

579
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:16,805
Dan, I actually wrote

580
00:50:19,015 --> 00:50:20,183
a report yesterday.

581
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:23,854
REPORT

582
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:37,826
But it didn't disappear
even after I finished writing.

583
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:39,661
I guess He's going to
answer my prayer, not yours.

584
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:40,662
Hey, what were you--

585
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:42,998
Watch me, Dan. I'll never give up on you.

586
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:46,001
I'll pull off this show no matter what.

587
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:47,294
And I'm going to

588
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:49,171
protect you.

589
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:55,385
I have to get ready.

590
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:58,221
Yeon-seo.

591
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:01,433
I love you.

592
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:05,187
Me too.

593
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:25,123
Yes, where are you?

594
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,231
Yes.

595
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:52,275
I'll look for her until you get here.

596
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:37,737
Where is Yeon-seo?

597
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:40,031
I'm not sure.
Director Ji, we're about to begin.

598
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:42,450
Everyone, let's go.

599
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:49,833
Let's go.

600
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:51,626
Me?

601
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,881
Everything is over. You need to give up.

602
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:22,384
It's not over.

603
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:24,594
I told you

604
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:27,138
that nice ones always lose
because they're too slow.

605
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:36,648
This is your chance to kill me.

606
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:48,618
Isn't this great?

607
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:51,413
It will be considered as an
accidental death caused by self-defense.

608
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,164
So even if you kill me,

609
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:56,418
you'll be able to live on in Korea.

610
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,265
Yes, kill me.

611
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:12,600
It's the only way this agony will end.

612
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:15,020
If you do not kill me,

613
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:17,188
I will go after Yeon-seo
until the very end.

614
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:18,606
Can I do that?

615
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:55,268
Where have you been?

616
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:56,686
I'm late.

617
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:58,980
Thank you for covering for me.
You did very well.

618
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:00,231
Go out there.

619
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:02,233
Ni-na.

620
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:07,530
Can you fill in for me tomorrow?

621
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:10,617
Please do that for me.

622
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:22,212
Please let me live.

623
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:28,009
Do not kill me.

624
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:32,764
Please.

625
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:47,195
Live.

626
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:49,781
Live and pay for your sin.

627
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:05,004
It was supposed to be you.

628
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:09,801
What do you mean?

629
00:57:14,722 --> 00:57:15,849
I'll look for her.

630
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:26,901
Please hurry and come.

631
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:33,825
Why are you here?

632
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:37,203
You can't touch Dan. Never.

633
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:40,665
Will you please

634
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:44,377
stop this? Will you?

635
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:54,471
I hope you enjoy my present.

636
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:57,223
Let's go.

637
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:51,486
I must finish this dance.

638
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:52,904
Please.

639
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:56,074
This is it.

640
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:57,784
This is

641
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:00,828
how I can save you.

642
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:49,460
Did you see that?

643
00:59:49,877 --> 00:59:51,921
No matter how hard I think about it,
I can't give up.

644
00:59:55,049 --> 00:59:57,135
If my dance moved your heart,

645
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:00,305
then please grant me one wish.

646
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:05,059
Please let Dan live.

647
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:40,595
Even if we cannot be together,

648
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:44,307
even if my heart breaks,

649
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:46,851
even if I cannot see him again,

650
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:51,814
I just want him to be alive.

651
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:24,472
Yeon-seo.

652
01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:28,017
You came.

653
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:31,938
I thought I might not get to see you.

654
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:51,541
No.

655
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:55,086
No, Yeon-seo.

656
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:58,131
I'm glad

657
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:01,259
that I could save you.

658
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:07,849
I love you.

659
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:19,527
Yeon-seo...

660
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:23,072
Yeon-seo...

661
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:25,950
Yeon-seo. Yeon-seo, wake up.

662
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:29,829
Yeon-seo, wake up. Yeon-seo.

663
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:31,622
Lee Yeon-seo!

664
01:02:32,498 --> 01:02:33,583
Yeon-seo!

665
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:36,919
Wake up, Yeon-seo!

666
01:02:37,795 --> 01:02:38,963
Yeon-seo!

667
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:41,883
Yeon-seo!

668
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:19,837
You will become a human.

669
01:03:20,254 --> 01:03:21,881
I said I would protect her.

670
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:26,552
Yeon-seo won't die.

671
01:03:26,886 --> 01:03:28,221
She won't.

672
01:03:29,263 --> 01:03:30,765
I hope you think

673
01:03:31,265 --> 01:03:32,934
that I went on a trip.

674
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:38,940
I hope you know that I'll miss you a lot.
