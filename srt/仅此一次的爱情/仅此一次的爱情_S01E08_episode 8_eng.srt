1
00:00:01,437 --> 00:00:03,497
Wow, looks delicious.

2
00:00:03,497 --> 00:00:05,277
   

3
00:00:08,247 --> 00:00:12,217
This is amazing. It's so delicious.

4
00:00:13,407 --> 00:00:15,367
Whoa! Are you okay?

5
00:00:15,367 --> 00:00:17,297
Gosh, that scared me.

6
00:00:17,297 --> 00:00:19,047
Are you all right?

7
00:00:21,987 --> 00:00:24,077
I feel even worse now.

8
00:00:24,987 --> 00:00:26,687
Are you trying to disguise yourself as all the human beings in the world?

9
00:00:26,687 --> 00:00:29,087
You only frequent places like this, so what choice do I have?

10
00:00:29,087 --> 00:00:32,987
Go somewhere better. There's more than ramen in the world.

11
00:00:32,987 --> 00:00:35,727
Say that after you give me a little allowance at least.

12
00:00:37,757 --> 00:00:39,237
Weren't you broke?

13
00:00:39,237 --> 00:00:41,947
Heaven sent down a little blessing from above.

14
00:00:42,927 --> 00:00:43,947
Oh, so you kept that money?

15
00:00:43,947 --> 00:00:48,507
Sunbae, we're angels. Of course, I gave it to the police.

16
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:50,867
I was going to ask the detective to lend me ₩30,000 (~$30).

17
00:00:50,867 --> 00:00:54,037
He felt bad for me so he just gave it to me. He's a good person.

18
00:00:54,037 --> 00:00:56,327
And with all that money, you chose this place out of all places?

19
00:00:59,737 --> 00:01:03,867
I wanted to observe love.

20
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:09,577
- Good, very good! 
- All right!

21
00:01:09,577 --> 00:01:11,327
Come here.

22
00:01:17,587 --> 00:01:19,597
Lee Yeon Seo,

23
00:01:20,697 --> 00:01:23,037
probably has never been like that. Right?

24
00:01:29,107 --> 00:01:33,097
What the...?! Take it away!

25
00:02:03,597 --> 00:02:06,407
Young Lady! Did you have breakfas—

26
00:02:06,407 --> 00:02:07,617
I'll do it!

27
00:02:07,617 --> 00:02:11,537
I told you to come and live in. How am I supposed to stay in this big house by myself?!!

28
00:02:11,537 --> 00:02:13,197
You could tell Dan to come in.

29
00:02:13,197 --> 00:02:15,087
I don't want to hear his name.

30
00:02:15,087 --> 00:02:18,897
Step outside for a moment. There's someone to see you outside.

31
00:02:26,727 --> 00:02:29,297
The reason I was late today.

32
00:02:32,127 --> 00:02:33,557
Who...?

33
00:02:38,797 --> 00:02:39,857
Lavender?

34
00:02:39,857 --> 00:02:41,967
I'm Ki Bo Ra.

35
00:02:42,497 --> 00:02:45,647
- But why? 
- After you fired her that day,

36
00:02:45,647 --> 00:02:47,977
I sent her to the ballet theatre.

37
00:02:47,977 --> 00:02:51,267
- Without my permission? 
 - I guess you could call this a sort of re-recruitment.

38
00:02:51,267 --> 00:02:54,637
But she said she saw something a few days earlier.

39
00:03:09,577 --> 00:03:13,867
While I'm uncertain whether Team Leader Jeon Bo Han deliberately caused the accident,

40
00:03:13,867 --> 00:03:17,537
what I know for sure is that he was a spy for the other side.

41
00:03:18,797 --> 00:03:21,087
Poor Dan must feel so wronged.

42
00:03:21,087 --> 00:03:23,497
Then why?

43
00:03:23,497 --> 00:03:26,397
- Then, why would he? 
- I told you, didn't I?

44
00:03:26,397 --> 00:03:29,217
It was love at first sight.

45
00:03:29,217 --> 00:03:30,667
You'll rehire him, won't you?

46
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:34,197
No. Why would I do that? It's not like I feel bad for him.

47
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:39,487
His address is the Catholic Church.

48
00:03:39,487 --> 00:03:44,197
Of course, I know that you would never go in search of him.

49
00:03:48,277 --> 00:03:50,697
Goo Reum, we must go back home.

50
00:03:51,597 --> 00:03:53,227
Wait. What?

51
00:03:56,397 --> 00:04:00,927
No way, did he come here because he got kicked out?

52
00:04:00,927 --> 00:04:02,857
Why here though?

53
00:04:19,867 --> 00:04:23,707
 Is it because we first met here? 

54
00:04:31,317 --> 00:04:33,277
Lee Yeon Seo.

55
00:04:42,397 --> 00:04:45,237
What is it? Why are you here?

56
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:51,367
You'll get double your salary and a 100% bonus, how's that?

57
00:04:52,017 --> 00:04:56,247
You have nowhere to go. Come back to work for me. You'll freeze to death if you sleep here.

58
00:04:59,897 --> 00:05:03,897
If you die, you'll haunt my dreams like a ghost.

59
00:05:09,747 --> 00:05:12,107
I have to be able to walk without a stick by next week.

60
00:05:12,107 --> 00:05:15,187
I have to no matter what. So...

61
00:05:16,947 --> 00:05:18,657
I need you.

62
00:05:18,657 --> 00:05:20,517
Because of the upcoming press conference?

63
00:05:21,247 --> 00:05:23,217
How did you know?

64
00:05:23,937 --> 00:05:26,277
There are rumor's going around the neighborhood.

65
00:05:26,277 --> 00:05:28,637
So you were being like this even after knowing about it?

66
00:05:28,637 --> 00:05:32,657
I was going to come back eventually because you desperately needed me.

67
00:05:38,397 --> 00:05:41,567
I don't need a doubled salary or a 100% bonus.

68
00:05:41,567 --> 00:05:44,977
Instead, I have one condition.

69
00:05:54,727 --> 00:05:56,677
Why are you in such a good mood?

70
00:05:57,487 --> 00:06:01,207
A few more days and I'll no longer be the temporary leader of Fantasia.

71
00:06:01,207 --> 00:06:02,437
Aren't you happy?

72
00:06:02,437 --> 00:06:05,737
It's for an extension of the power of attorney. Won't we still be temporary?

73
00:06:08,447 --> 00:06:14,397
How many times do I have to tell you? If you were born as a human then use your brain at a level

74
00:06:14,397 --> 00:06:16,317
that's higher than an animal's.

75
00:06:16,317 --> 00:06:20,767
Since Ji Kang Woo's already set the stage for me, all that's left is to start the show.

76
00:06:20,767 --> 00:06:24,107
She got two legs but can't walk, yet she dares to do ballet?

77
00:06:24,107 --> 00:06:27,757
No matter what happens, she'll never be able to attend (the press conference).

78
00:06:27,757 --> 00:06:30,537
We'll make sure the press conference happens.

79
00:06:30,537 --> 00:06:33,587
We'll release an article stating that Yeon Seo will be attending.

80
00:06:33,667 --> 00:06:35,067
But then...

81
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,387
That could be a great disappointment for people.

82
00:06:40,387 --> 00:06:44,697
And you're going to take over the foundation over that?

83
00:06:45,627 --> 00:06:47,697
A hundred points!

84
00:07:06,577 --> 00:07:08,217
Again.

85
00:07:08,217 --> 00:07:12,877
Excuse me. It's time for me to pick up my child.

86
00:07:12,877 --> 00:07:16,257
- You can leave. 
- Thank you.

87
00:07:16,257 --> 00:07:20,687
Forever. Start the group dance over again.

88
00:07:26,177 --> 00:07:27,857
Music.

89
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:49,607
Are you protesting? Why aren't you leaving? You said you need to go.

90
00:07:49,607 --> 00:07:50,637
No, it's fine, Sir.

91
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:54,547
Your breath and balance are off and you're distracted already,

92
00:07:54,547 --> 00:07:56,347
can you still call that dancing?

93
00:07:56,347 --> 00:07:57,997
- Soo Ji. 
- Yes.

94
00:07:57,997 --> 00:08:00,597
You can do the press call instead.

95
00:08:02,627 --> 00:08:04,637
Then, I'll be the understudy.

96
00:08:04,637 --> 00:08:07,937
Says who? I'm not going to allow it!

97
00:08:07,937 --> 00:08:11,717
Now, start from the beginning again. Everyone get your head on straight.

98
00:08:11,717 --> 00:08:15,727
Engage every single muscle in your body. Get ready.

99
00:08:17,427 --> 00:08:19,327
Music!

100
00:08:30,897 --> 00:08:32,937
You're getting off work late.

101
00:08:32,937 --> 00:08:34,377
As are you.

102
00:08:34,377 --> 00:08:39,287
Director, have you eaten yet?

103
00:08:49,157 --> 00:08:53,517
Jung Won is back after only six months since giving birth.

104
00:08:53,517 --> 00:08:58,127
She cries every day, trying to get her body back in shape.

105
00:08:58,127 --> 00:08:59,877
So what?

106
00:09:02,447 --> 00:09:05,537
Instead of her, please blame me.

107
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,987
It's all my fault anyway.

108
00:09:08,987 --> 00:09:13,857
If I hadn't broadcast on SNS and taken that photo with Yeon Seo,

109
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:17,647
we wouldn't have to go as far as having a press conference.

110
00:09:17,647 --> 00:09:21,667
So, right now, because of Yeon Seo's press conference I

111
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:26,277
scolded an innocent person for nothing? Is that what you think?

112
00:09:30,557 --> 00:09:37,777
Hwang Jeong Won has only been a soloist, so her synchronization with a group is totally lacking.

113
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:43,287
When Yeon Seo comes back I want to have the perfect team for her.

114
00:09:46,357 --> 00:09:49,957
You don't need to do that two-shot,

115
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:52,327
because Yeon Seo will be there in person.

116
00:09:52,327 --> 00:09:56,057
Yes. Yeon Seo will show up.

117
00:09:56,717 --> 00:10:00,697
No matter how much she denies it. She can't give up ballet.

118
00:10:01,317 --> 00:10:04,307
How can you be so sure of that?

119
00:10:04,307 --> 00:10:07,457
She would often scold the troupe members that way.

120
00:10:07,457 --> 00:10:11,217
She said we were all people who were given a talent from the heavens,

121
00:10:11,217 --> 00:10:14,167
to do it properly so that

122
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:18,317
all those who want or ever wanted the positions we hold are not ashamed.

123
00:10:18,737 --> 00:10:23,227
It was also something our childhood ballet teacher was fond of saying.

124
00:10:26,197 --> 00:10:28,247
She learned well from the start.

125
00:10:28,247 --> 00:10:31,977
Yeon Seo will definitely return to the stage.

126
00:10:31,977 --> 00:10:34,967
And when she does, I will face her and do my best to compete.

127
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:39,947
Then focus. Is this the time to be concerned with other people?

128
00:10:42,277 --> 00:10:46,117
You're right. Why do I keep...

129
00:10:46,857 --> 00:10:49,387
focusing on someone else?

130
00:10:50,137 --> 00:10:52,857
You're still far from being selfish.

131
00:10:59,997 --> 00:11:04,587
 But what can I do? The Lee Yeon Seo you remember is already dead and gone. 

132
00:11:04,587 --> 00:11:08,007
 Are you gonna keep lecturing me? 

133
00:11:08,007 --> 00:11:13,627
 I know better than anyone in the world how much of a hot mess I am. 

134
00:11:13,627 --> 00:11:17,647
Sometimes you need to push yourself so you can go farther.

135
00:11:17,647 --> 00:11:19,827
 When you're going through difficulties, 

136
00:11:19,827 --> 00:11:26,877
 what you really need is a sweetness of chocolate rather than a harsh whiplash. Okay? 

137
00:11:37,117 --> 00:11:39,067
Yes, this is Ji Kang Woo.

138
00:11:48,357 --> 00:11:49,267
What is this?

139
00:11:49,267 --> 00:11:52,237
Try to start from the beginning, working on steps. You know how a baby starts walking.

140
00:11:52,237 --> 00:11:53,697
Baby steps, step-by-step.

141
00:11:53,697 --> 00:11:56,677
Did you find evidence this would work from psychology research?

142
00:11:56,677 --> 00:11:59,127
- Nope. 
- Oh my gosh!

143
00:11:59,127 --> 00:12:00,277
Let's still try it.

144
00:12:00,277 --> 00:12:04,517
You boasted that you would make it.  I won't let you be humiliated. Okay?

145
00:12:06,817 --> 00:12:10,217
♫  1, 2, A 1, 2, 3, 4  ♫

146
00:12:14,577 --> 00:12:16,087
♫  I~  ♫

147
00:12:16,087 --> 00:12:18,727
Okay, then starting from here.

148
00:12:18,727 --> 00:12:19,717
Let's do it like this.

149
00:12:19,717 --> 00:12:22,937
Hold me from here. You can do it!

150
00:12:22,937 --> 00:12:26,817
♫  Summer heat with ice  ♫

151
00:12:26,817 --> 00:12:29,427
You're doing great. Good job.

152
00:12:29,427 --> 00:12:30,937
♫  Yeah I could drown  ♫

153
00:12:30,937 --> 00:12:33,947
Good job. From here, let's hold on with just pinky fingers.

154
00:12:33,947 --> 00:12:35,647
You can do it!

155
00:12:35,647 --> 00:12:40,007
♫  Oh wouldn't it be better  ♫

156
00:12:40,007 --> 00:12:44,017
♫  if we could decide to stick  ♫

157
00:12:44,017 --> 00:12:46,187
♫  together  ♫

158
00:12:46,187 --> 00:12:51,537
♫  Give me something sweeter  ♫

159
00:12:52,867 --> 00:12:56,367
♫  Something to show, show that you love me  ♫

160
00:12:56,367 --> 00:13:00,837
♫  I want something sweeter  ♫

161
00:13:00,837 --> 00:13:05,047
♫  You see, something to show  ♫

162
00:13:05,047 --> 00:13:06,407
Here! Come to me!

163
00:13:06,407 --> 00:13:08,597
♫  love me  ♫

164
00:13:23,927 --> 00:13:26,487
Just look at me.

165
00:13:26,487 --> 00:13:32,227
Just think that you and I are the only people in this whole world.

166
00:13:34,817 --> 00:13:36,537
Okay?

167
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:52,967
Oh no. He shouldn't be really into me.

168
00:13:56,687 --> 00:13:58,527
All right, come here.

169
00:14:20,287 --> 00:14:22,427
At home, we just fold arms together but—

170
00:14:22,427 --> 00:14:24,827
It's dangerous.

171
00:14:26,437 --> 00:14:28,647
Hey, you got a hole here.

172
00:14:29,427 --> 00:14:31,357
Leave it!

173
00:14:31,357 --> 00:14:33,057
Okay.

174
00:14:38,397 --> 00:14:40,817
Kissing, they're kissing!

175
00:14:40,817 --> 00:14:41,967
Kiss, kiss!

176
00:14:41,967 --> 00:14:44,817
- Kid, we're just... 
- Hey!

177
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:48,467
Do you know me? Just go to your mom.

178
00:14:53,077 --> 00:14:55,527
Kissing. Kissing.

179
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:57,317
Kiss.

180
00:15:01,257 --> 00:15:02,667
It's not that...

181
00:15:02,667 --> 00:15:08,007
Hurry and go. Stop thinking out loud embarrassingly.

182
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:10,027
I have a wish.

183
00:15:10,887 --> 00:15:12,377
Already?

184
00:15:12,377 --> 00:15:15,467
 Instead, I have a condition. 

185
00:15:17,327 --> 00:15:19,647
 Grant me wishes. Just three of them. 

186
00:15:19,647 --> 00:15:23,697
 The wishes that I ask for, ask you to do, you must do them no matter what. 

187
00:15:23,697 --> 00:15:27,247
 Are you going to ask for my fortune or my life? Is that it? 

188
00:15:27,247 --> 00:15:31,797
 Hey! Who do you think I am? They'll be good wishes for you, no matter what. 

189
00:15:32,947 --> 00:15:35,577
 Are you going to grant them, or not? 

190
00:15:36,507 --> 00:15:38,427
First wish.

191
00:15:39,457 --> 00:15:43,237
If it's weird, I'm going to kill you.

192
00:15:43,237 --> 00:15:44,727
We're going to be late. Let's hurry.

193
00:15:44,727 --> 00:15:45,537
To where?

194
00:15:45,537 --> 00:15:47,217
To make a wish.

195
00:15:47,217 --> 00:15:50,817
Your first wish is to go make a wish?

196
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:52,257
Yeah.

197
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:00,327
I thought you believed in some other deity.

198
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:04,697
You said something about God up above and how we're foolish in his eyes or something.

199
00:16:06,237 --> 00:16:09,987
It's "we are the world." God loves everyone.

200
00:16:10,817 --> 00:16:12,467
Let's go.

201
00:16:19,517 --> 00:16:21,717
Why wishes? So useless.

202
00:16:21,717 --> 00:16:26,597
Because your life is totally lacking virtues you need to beg for blessings.

203
00:16:26,597 --> 00:16:29,797
If I could gain from wishing, then why was I blind?

204
00:16:29,797 --> 00:16:31,687
Oh, ye of little faith.

205
00:16:31,687 --> 00:16:33,357
Let's go.

206
00:16:34,257 --> 00:16:35,287
Hello.

207
00:16:35,287 --> 00:16:37,297
Oh, yes. What are you doing here?

208
00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:41,087
We're going to light some lamps after making wishes.

209
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:44,487
Oh, I came to say hello to a friend. His urn has been here for 15 years.

210
00:16:44,487 --> 00:16:46,177
It's the anniversary of his death.

211
00:16:46,177 --> 00:16:51,097
This is the last call. There are two lamps left.

212
00:16:51,097 --> 00:16:52,487
Well, then.

213
00:16:52,487 --> 00:16:53,297
Go on in.

214
00:16:53,297 --> 00:16:55,297
Would you like to join?

215
00:16:56,687 --> 00:16:58,507
It's a good thing.

216
00:16:58,507 --> 00:17:01,297
Excuse me! There are two people that'd like to go in.

217
00:17:01,297 --> 00:17:03,697
Hey, you didn't even ask Kang Woo.

218
00:17:03,697 --> 00:17:05,787
I'm fine.

219
00:17:40,157 --> 00:17:41,797
Aren't you doing it?

220
00:17:41,797 --> 00:17:46,267
I don't know what to write down.

221
00:17:46,267 --> 00:17:48,227
I don't really have any expectations.

222
00:17:48,227 --> 00:17:51,857
Then, just write the most common stuff.

223
00:17:51,857 --> 00:17:55,087
Like: "Please make me happy."

224
00:17:55,087 --> 00:17:59,387
Is that what you wrote?

225
00:18:13,697 --> 00:18:15,217
 You'll help me? 

226
00:18:15,217 --> 00:18:17,517
 Yes. Let me know whenever you need me. 

227
00:18:17,517 --> 00:18:19,007
 I'll do my best. 

228
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:22,067
 I'm thankful. I'll be sure to compensate you. 

229
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:23,787
 No, I don't need any rewards. 

230
00:18:23,787 --> 00:18:26,967
 Just make sure Yeon Seo safely makes her comeback. 

231
00:18:28,147 --> 00:18:32,617
 That way naturally the two of you will meet very often. 

232
00:18:32,617 --> 00:18:34,707
 A temple? 

233
00:18:34,707 --> 00:18:36,257
 A temple would be a little hard. 

234
00:18:36,257 --> 00:18:38,167
 There's a lantern festival on that day. 

235
00:18:38,167 --> 00:18:42,737
 In advance of the important day, please come out to make a wish. 

236
00:18:42,737 --> 00:18:44,497
 You said you'd help. 

237
00:18:44,497 --> 00:18:50,267
 Yeon Seo isn't taking my calls or responding to messages. We need to make a "coincidence." 

238
00:18:51,727 --> 00:18:53,897
  We will begin floating the lanterns shortly.  

239
00:18:53,897 --> 00:18:57,627
 Everyone, please come to Doseolchon now. 

240
00:18:57,627 --> 00:18:59,807
Let's hurry.

241
00:18:59,807 --> 00:19:01,867
My shoes.

242
00:19:03,047 --> 00:19:06,997
I put them over here. Wait.

243
00:19:12,757 --> 00:19:16,247
What? They're gone. They're the shoes that we always practice in.

244
00:19:19,237 --> 00:19:20,827
Someone stole them.

245
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,657
They must've gotten them mixed up and wore the wrong shoes.

246
00:19:22,657 --> 00:19:24,957
Then there needs to be a pair left behind, but there are none.

247
00:19:24,957 --> 00:19:28,827
This means someone took them on purpose.

248
00:19:28,827 --> 00:19:31,047
What do we do?

249
00:19:31,047 --> 00:19:33,207
The thieves probably didn't get very far.

250
00:19:33,207 --> 00:19:36,057
I'll go find them. Wait here.

251
00:19:39,567 --> 00:19:41,287
  I repeat.  

252
00:19:41,287 --> 00:19:44,387
  The lantern floating begins in ten minutes.  

253
00:19:44,387 --> 00:19:46,657
 Please hurry. 

254
00:19:47,617 --> 00:19:49,057
Here, get on.

255
00:19:49,057 --> 00:19:53,467
It's fine. Dan will find them.

256
00:19:53,467 --> 00:19:55,297
If time passes, it all becomes useless.

257
00:19:55,297 --> 00:19:57,787
In everything, the timing must be right.

258
00:19:57,787 --> 00:20:02,507
♫  You  ♫

259

00:20:26,057 --> 00:20:30,157
Relax. I'm getting more tired because you're so uptight.

264
00:20:30,157 --> 00:20:31,327
I want to get off. Let me down.

265
00:20:31,327 --> 00:20:34,027
Hold on a little longer. We're almost there.

266

The press conference.

272
00:21:20,537 --> 00:21:24,067
If it's too burdensome, let me know. You don't have to do it.

273
00:21:24,767 --> 00:21:30,477
The performance, too. I'll hold off until you say "okay."

274
00:21:30,477 --> 00:21:32,877
I'm sorry about that day.

275
00:21:32,877 --> 00:21:35,367
But, please know this,

276
00:21:35,367 --> 00:21:39,087

Where are you? Why aren't you coming?

00:22:23,957 --> 00:22:26,737
We're by the water, next to a big rock.

291
00:22:26,737 --> 00:22:31,037
I found your shoes. I'll make my way over, so float your wish.

 Whatever it is, just tell me.

 No matter what, do it for the lady's happiness. 

299
00:23:02,267 --> 00:23:04,687
 Happiness? That's very abstract. 

300
00:23:04,687 --> 00:23:07,447

 Let the fated match,

What is this?

311
00:24:14,027 --> 00:24:17,507
I thought we had agreed to take Lee Yeon Seo's name out and just do a press conference announcing our performances for this year.

312
00:24:17,507 --> 00:24:21,677
I apologize, but Yeon Seo already promised that she would be here.

313
00:24:21,677 --> 00:24:24,477
The board of directors was informed as such. I was told to push ahead.

314
00:24:24,477 --> 00:24:26,267
No, I'm sure it was just the chairman.

315
00:24:26,267 --> 00:24:27,957
Or it was the general director.

316
00:24:27,957 --> 00:24:30,417
You're right.

317
00:24:30,417 --> 00:24:33,077
I told them not to cancel it.

318
00:24:33,077 --> 00:24:39,387
You're getting Yeon Seo like you wanted. What's the problem?

319
00:25:09,327 --> 00:25:11,707
   

320
00:25:21,297 --> 00:25:22,737
I apologize.

321
00:25:22,737 --> 00:25:25,807
Unfortunately, for Ms. Lee Yeon Seo,

322
00:25:25,807 --> 00:25:29,187
there have been alarming discoveries in her psychological—

323
00:25:29,187 --> 00:25:31,367
She's here now!

324
00:25:58,067 --> 00:26:01,347
 I told you I'd show you. 

325
00:26:08,587 --> 00:26:11,767
   

326
00:26:15,317 --> 00:26:17,527
You came here on your own?

327
00:26:27,187 --> 00:26:32,487
Hello, I'm the ballerina Lee Yeon Seo.

328
00:26:33,367 --> 00:26:38,417
Dancers speak through their bodies, do they not? Then I don't need to say much.

329
00:26:38,417 --> 00:26:43,697
I can see now and my mind and body are perfectly healthy.

330
00:26:43,697 --> 00:26:49,387
As for any other specifics, I'll let my dancing speak for itself once I've returned to the stage.

331
00:26:58,037 --> 00:26:59,457
Congratulations.

332
00:26:59,457 --> 00:27:00,527
Oh, yes. Thank you.

333
00:27:00,527 --> 00:27:01,677
Yes, yes. Take care.

334
00:27:01,677 --> 00:27:03,357
Thank you.

335
00:27:08,617 --> 00:27:12,997
You've been fine from the beginning, haven't you? You did all this to screw me over!

336
00:27:12,997 --> 00:27:16,527
You're my legal representative as of now, right?

337
00:27:16,527 --> 00:27:18,277
Why do you ask?

338
00:27:18,277 --> 00:27:21,637
I'd like to retract that first. Please retract it.

339
00:27:22,347 --> 00:27:27,137
Can you organize the management state of the foundation and give it to me, Roo Na?

340
00:27:27,137 --> 00:27:28,887
Would you know anything by looking at it?

341
00:27:28,887 --> 00:27:33,157
I guess you could make sure it's organized in a way that's comfortable and efficient for me to read.

342
00:27:34,397 --> 00:27:38,017
So you're asking for Fantasia back right now?

343
00:27:38,017 --> 00:27:41,837
I'm not asking for it back, I'm having it returned to me.

344
00:27:41,837 --> 00:27:45,657
Fantasia was mine to begin with.

345
00:27:45,657 --> 00:27:48,297
Please take care of it promptly.

346
00:27:52,857 --> 00:27:54,457
Hey!

347
00:27:55,567 --> 00:27:58,727
 I got a call from Ji Kang Woo. They're going to proceed with the press conference. 

348
00:27:58,727 --> 00:28:01,437
 Shall I go in advance and put the footprints down for you? 

349
00:28:01,437 --> 00:28:02,827
 Or do you want me to just go with— 

350
00:28:02,827 --> 00:28:06,877
 I have to go by myself. Otherwise, they'll try to make something else up. 

351
00:28:06,877 --> 00:28:09,137
 Still, you're not completely ready yet. 

352
00:28:09,137 --> 00:28:10,727
 I can do it. 

353
00:28:10,727 --> 00:28:13,417
 Give me that thing instead. 

354
00:28:13,417 --> 00:28:17,127
 Your handkerchief. The one you wrapped on my wrist the other day. 

355
00:28:17,127 --> 00:28:21,277
 The one you put a spell on. I'll think of it as you. 

356
00:28:31,407 --> 00:28:33,007
You did great!

357
00:28:33,007 --> 00:28:36,037
Good job, Lee Yeon Seo! I'm proud of you, Lee Yeon Seo!

358
00:28:36,037 --> 00:28:40,317
Here's a congratulatory drink! It's non-alcoholic, but let's still celebrate.

359
00:28:48,467 --> 00:28:51,067
What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

360
00:28:53,427 --> 00:28:54,347
Did you overdo it today?

361
00:28:54,347 --> 00:28:57,177
Thank you, Kim Dan.

362
00:28:59,287 --> 00:29:01,427
It was all thanks to you.

363
00:29:02,417 --> 00:29:05,957
Thank you. I mean it.

364
00:29:17,847 --> 00:29:21,627
You're the one that did all the work. You did well.

365
00:29:21,627 --> 00:29:24,127
Really, really well.

366
00:29:28,847 --> 00:29:30,607
Cheers?

367
00:29:38,817 --> 00:29:42,017
 We're at the amphitheater. Come quick! 

368
00:29:52,437 --> 00:29:54,857
Oh, you're a pro at it now!

369
00:29:57,417 --> 00:30:02,107
I guess you really don't need me anymore now.

370
00:30:04,197 --> 00:30:06,097
So it seems.

371
00:30:07,967 --> 00:30:09,857
So this is how it's going to be.

372
00:30:09,857 --> 00:30:14,527
The better and happier you get,

373
00:30:14,527 --> 00:30:17,087
the less I'll have to do.

374
00:30:20,937 --> 00:30:24,167
Hey, Noisy Gong! Walk all you want now.

375
00:30:24,167 --> 00:30:27,027
Dance away and lessen that temper of yours, too.

376
00:30:27,027 --> 00:30:28,127
Is that one of your wishes?

377
00:30:28,127 --> 00:30:30,917
Of course not. I only have two left.

378
00:30:30,917 --> 00:30:33,217
I have to use them wisely.

379
00:30:34,797 --> 00:30:36,957
I think I know what they are.

380
00:30:37,977 --> 00:30:39,357
How would you know that?

381
00:30:39,357 --> 00:30:41,697
Close your eyes.

382
00:30:41,697 --> 00:30:45,017
- What for? 
 - Your wish. I'm going to grant it to you.

383
00:30:45,017 --> 00:30:47,017
Do it before I change my mind. Hurry up.

384
00:30:47,857 --> 00:30:52,387
I'm pretty sure you're on the wrong track though. There's no way you could know.

385
00:30:52,387 --> 00:30:54,147
Sure, then.

386
00:31:11,967 --> 00:31:13,627
Well, what are you do...

387
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:19,647
That's not— I was going for a reward on the cheek...

388
00:31:19,647 --> 00:31:22,337
Why did you turn your head?!

389
00:31:23,687 --> 00:31:30,627


390
00:31:44,727 --> 00:31:50,187

  Please! 

394
00:32:02,567 --> 00:32:04,627
 Please, no! 

395
00:32:04,627 --> 00:32:08,347

 Lee Yeon Seo is just my client and once I've made her fall in love, 
   

409
00:33:06,087 --> 00:33:08,347
 I'm going back to Heaven without fail.

 Is a kiss such a common thing for him that he can act like it didn't even happen? 

412
00:33:15,057 --> 00:33:19,597
 Lee Yeon Seo, get your head on straight! 

413
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:22,867
 Fantasia Night will be held in two weeks.
