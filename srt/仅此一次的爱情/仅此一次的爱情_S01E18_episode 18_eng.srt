1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,170
     

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:11,100


3
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,650
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,210
For what?

5
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:32,290
Everything. For being mean and hurting you that day.

6
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:36,060
Even now, everything.

7
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:41,960
So, you're saying you're not coming with me.

8
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:50,000
Even you?

9
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:55,540
My mom, and dad, and Mr. Jo, too.

10
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,910
And even Seong Woo.

11
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,420
The people I loved, they all

12
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,560
went far away and left me behind.

13
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,600
I couldn't even properly say goodbye.

14
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,040
Do you know what I felt after that?

15
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:17,800
I felt like I was alone in an endless desert.

16
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:25,180
So, can't you... stay by my side?

17
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:33,910
Don't you remember? The wish you gave me?

18
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,580
Fulfill my wishes. Three of them.

19
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:41,210
You must do the things I ask you to do without refusal.

20
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:46,940
I'll use the second wish out of the three right now.

21
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,450
Why are you suddenly talking about a wish?

22
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,100
Please wait for me.

23
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:55,560
Just a little, If you wait just a little while...

24
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,910
I'll be back after I sort it all out. Don't ask anything right now.

25
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:03,870
What do you need to sort out? What happened?

26
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,810
I need to know in order for me to help you.

27
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,450
What is it that...

28
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:17,470
This... That's it.

29
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,400
The thing you gave me when you left me alone.

30
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:25,180
I promise you, I won't take long. I'll be back for sure.

31
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,980
Until then, eat well, and practice well,

32
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,310
live a good life.

33
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,400
That is my wish. You can do that, right?

34
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:45,970
♫   Because of you, you ♫ 

35
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:53,250
♫   Always, always stay by my side  ♫ 

36
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,900
♫   I will always protect you  ♫ 

37
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:02,770
♫   I will always love you, to you  ♫ 

38
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:06,920
♫   Baby, I love you, baby, I need you  ♫ 

39
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,430
♫   It can’t be explained ♫ 

40
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:16,130
♫   You’re my one and only love, it’s you  ♫ 

41
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:24,330
♫   Because of you, you ♫ 

42
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:29,850
♫   If you leave me, I’m broken in my heart ♫ 

43
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:37,390
♫   Because of you, you ♫ 

44
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:44,770
♫   Always, always stay by my side ♫ 

45
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:48,250

46
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,780
♫   I will always love you, to you ♫ 

47
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,010
Director Ji, what are you doing here—

48
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,780
Please stop crying because of that jerk.

49
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,990
What do you think you're doing?

50
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:08,670
Just give up. Stop having feelings to a guy that keeps on running away.

51
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:12,190
I know you depended on him when you were hurting and weak,

52
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:15,930
but now you can't. I won't allow you to cry because of him.

53
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:19,510
- Who are you to say that, Director Ji? 
 - Depend on me.

54
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:24,440
I won't run away, and... I won't disappear either.

55
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:32,460
There's something I need to clarify. If you keep being like this, it's uncomfortable.

56
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,260
I know that you helped me recover and pushed me.

57
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,620
I know that. I thank you.

58
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,220
But that's your work as a director.

59
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,230
Don't cross the line.

60
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:45,760
It's my choice to decide on whom I depend and whom I cry for.

61
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,840
You don't have the right to control my emotions.

62
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,510
I hope what happened today won't ever happen again.

63
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:58,190
Let me apologize if I startled you,

64
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:01,550
but I can't promise that it won't happen again.

65
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,410
I'm sincere when I tell you to depend on me.

66
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:09,180
- Director Ji–
 - For today, yes, that's enough.

67
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,810
Let's go.

68
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,180
Thank you for the ride.

69
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,760
Rest well.

70
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,350
Ms. Yeon Seo.

71
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,350
I'll see you at rehearsal.

72
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:37,210
You once told me that life is full of surprises.

73
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:45,120
I had no idea... this day would come.

74
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,440
 I thought... I would always roam around 

75
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,860
 like a ghost. 

76
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:56,730
 Neither alive... nor dead. 

77
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:04,310
 I guess I've also become a trivial human. 

78
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:17,350
  Please, wait for me. I promise you.  

79
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:46,920
♫  Just stay, please stay with me  ♫

80
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:55,660
Is this... the answer to my prayers?

81
00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:02,120
♫  I'll stay, just like now  ♫

82
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,900
 Why were you only watching? 

83
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,620
 Why did you let me die painfully? 

84
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:13,090
 If that's the case, why did you have me born? 

85
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:20,760
 Why did you make me remember everything? 

86
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,060
I've found a new secretary for you.

87
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,780
I'm thinking of holding an interview next week.

88
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,810
Cancel it.

89
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,730
I know you trust me so much,

90
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,730
but I seriously can't live here.

91
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:02,970
Dan is coming back.

92
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:08,440
I can now say his name? Kim Dan?

93
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,290
Did he contact you?

94
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:16,440
Kim Dan said he's coming back. He promised me.

95
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,900
What a surprise. When is he coming back?

96
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,790
When will he be reinstated?

97
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:23,220
I don't know about that.

98
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,590
Anyway, I don't need a new secretary. I'll be waiting for Dan.

99
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:34,950
What? That was the magic (you've changed)?

100
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:43,140
Let's have a talk.

101
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,320
Watch how you act.

102
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,310
What?

103
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:56,070
The corps isn't on your side because you came back.

104
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,880
I know that. I can feel that whenever we practice.

105
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,560
Then, you should have some concern.

106
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,270
If you skip practice as you please and meet with Director Ji privately,

107
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,120
what will everyone think of you two?

108
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,560
What is this? Are you assuming Director Ji and I...

109
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,020
If it's like that, just truthfully—

110
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:16,810
Don't make something up. What you're thinking of isn't true.

111
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,350
Why? It's understandable. From the start,

112
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:25,600
we went on a strike because Director Ji was abnormally persistent about choosing you.

113
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,460
You just need to be careful. If our ties with Director Ji sever because of you—

114
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:35,660
Geum Ni Na, do you like Director Ji?

115
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:41,270
Hey, how could you think that?

116
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,770
I just really respect Director Ji.

117
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:47,030
You really can't hide your feelings.

118
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:50,010
Hey. Don't frame me because you feel wronged.

119
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:52,980
I... I...

120
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:59,270
Right. I'm doing this because I can't accept such a dirty rumor spreading in Fantasia.

121
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:02,420
Then, how about you stop babbling in front of me and find those who spread the rumor?

122
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:08,530
I've never adopted an expedient or did anything shameful.

123
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,530
What is this?

124
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,160
It's not what you think, Director Ji. We are just—

125
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,400
Apparently, there is a rumor that I've been having some kind of relationship with you.

126
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,750
If you keep the favor I asked of you, it should be fine. You remember, right?

127
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:30,370
I told you that I won't be able to.

128
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:32,820
Please don't bring your emotions to work. Let's be professional.

129
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,970
Don't worry.

130
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,530
Who started that foolish rumor?

131
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:44,000
I mean, that...

132
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,930
All right, let's get started.

133
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,590
Lower your shoulders.

134
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:53,620
Dad, why are you outside?

135
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:57,210
I was waiting for my daughter because I haven't seen her in a while.

136
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,470
Dad.

137
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:04,530
Drink some soup. Your insides must be warm for your mood to get better.

138
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,680
Thanks, Dad.

139
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,310
It's difficult, isn't it?

140
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:18,320
Don't try too hard because of Yeon Seo. She's pitiful.

141
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,740
Why are you always like this?

142
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:25,040
How is Yeon Seo pitiful? She's beautiful, rich, and talented.

143
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,310
God must have only loved her. I'm sure of that.

144
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:34,950
If God loved her, he wouldn't have taken her parents that early.

145
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:37,300
No matter how beautiful, rich,

146
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:41,280
or talented, how does that matter?  That terrible event happened.

147
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:46,140
She's an unlucky, miserable girl. So Ni Na,

148
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:49,590
you should take care of her.

149
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,250
Who's side are you on, Dad?

150
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,670
I'm forever on your side.

151
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:57,200
I'm telling you to take Yeon Seo's side.

152
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:03,520
I don't want to. Ever since I was born, I've been competing against her.

153
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,920
I can't be on the same side as her.

154
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,960
There's a reason why karma exists.

155
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,340
Whatever people do,

156
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:18,630
whether it's good or bad, it'll all come back.

157
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:24,500
You and Roo Na must be safe.

158
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,110
What does that mean?

159
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:32,830
Live as a nice person, like you are now.

160
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,590
Every person, one by one?

161
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:50,790
There aren't many people in the corps.

162
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:54,220
Will three to four days be enough?

163
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:59,850
How burdensome. It would be better if there was a better way.

164
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:05,600
I've considered appointing new judges, but we sounded very confident in front of the corps.

165
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,580
Gathering each vote like this is faster.

166
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,010
Let me ask my associate director for this one favor.

167
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,900
Yes, General Director Choi.

168
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,860
Start with Han Jeong Eun.

169
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:21,130
 As the oldest of the corps, if we win her over, many more will follow. 

170
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:30,030
 Then it's Soo Ji. She's a poor girl who tutors several children to make ends meet. 

171
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,850
 If we win over the lead's male partner, it'll be convenient in many ways. 

172
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,630
 Are you doing fine, Kim Dan? 

173
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:30,510
Can't fall asleep?

174
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:34,640
Not really. It's raining. Would you like some tea?

175
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:39,020
On these days, fish cake soup and soju are the best.

176
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,180
You want a glass?

177
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:51,350
I like drinking alone. You can go back in.

178
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:02,500
Butler, if a man

179
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,880
asks you to wait a bit, to give him time,

180
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,830
what does that mean?

181
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:12,130
Are you dating?

182
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:16,470
No. A friend asked me for my advice.

183
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:20,530
You have more experience than I do, so

184
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:24,650
I could tell her with more certainty.

185
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,370
Is (she dating) a married man?

186
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,050
No.

187
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,240
- Is he? 
 - Run away.

188
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,380
What do you mean?

189
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:39,710
Men never retreat when it comes to love.

190
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:44,970
He needs time? He's going into a cave? What bullshit.

191
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:49,130
He seemed really earnest... according to my friend.

192
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:52,810
He was leaving behind an important handkerchief. That's a token of his promise.

193
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:57,550
To her, it may be a token of his promise. But to him, it might be just trash.

194
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:08,960
I don't know who that man is, but give up.

195
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,700
- I told you it's a friend. 
 - Since when did you have friends?

196
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,000
I do have friends. Why don't you believe me?

197
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:26,220
I guess I'll have to look for another secretary.

198
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,760
She catches on fast.

199
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:35,760
Kim Dan, where are you and what are you doing?

200
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:41,570
     

201
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,980
     

202
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,070
     

203
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:07,130
 Come here! 

204
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,320
 You ungrateful brat. How dare you talk back to me? 

205
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,660
You foolish one.

206
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:59,340
Those who abuse children and trample on someone's life

207
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,230
will face a bolt of lightning.

208
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:09,330
Why? Are you going to hit me again?

209
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:15,440
Go ahead. Hit me mercilessly just like that time!

210
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:21,230
Why did you do that? Why?!

211
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,200
I was your son.

212
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,480
I was just...

213
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,030
I was just 12 years old.

214
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:38,450
After running away, what kind of life did you live?

215
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,440
What about your life?

216
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,820
Your son's life.

217
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:51,010
What is this?

218
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,980
I'm sorry, my son.

219
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:04,050
I am sorry.

220
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,450
I'm sorry.

221
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:17,450
I was wrong.

222
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:21,550
Stop. Stop that.

223
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:25,100
Stop. Stop it!

224
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:33,460
I'm sorry.

225
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:05,920
His apology won't make any difference now.

226
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:10,100
I'm angry. I'm really angry.

227
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,720
Humans are like that. They commit sins, regret, and reflect on them.

228
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,490
That human always lived with a regretful heart.

229
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:23,770
He donated every penny he saved for the benefit of children.

230
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:26,440
He did volunteer work at this hospital for 13 years,

231
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,310
although his health was ruined as he didn't take care of himself well.

232
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:33,610
That won't bring back the dead boy.

233
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:36,300
But he was able to save a child who could've died.

234
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,480
I guess his good deeds paid off.

235
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:44,190
He managed to apologize to you before he died. I thought it would be impossible.

236
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:52,910
What do you expect from me?

237
00:22:54,870 --> 00:23:00,320
Still, I was a human and I was born and lived a pitiful life under God's will.

238
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,170
I should have never found out then. Why did He let me remember this?

239
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:07,030
Why did He make me meet Yeon Seo when I can't tell her who I am.

240
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:11,260
I'm sure you know God always prepares an answer.

241
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:14,720
It's just that we're too blind to see His answer.

242
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:19,450
Let's go to the cathedral first. Let's pray together.

243
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,670
- I'm not going. 
 -  Kim Dan.

244
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:25,270
He gave me a new riddle.

245
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,670
I'm going to find an answer on my own.

246
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:41,890
Goodbye, sunbae.

247
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,200
Are you possibly—

248
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,610
It really must have been so hard for you to handle a troublemaker like me all this time.

249
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:52,870
I'm thankful for every moment. I respected you.

250
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,790
Do you still have unfinished business left on Earth?

251
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:30,990
Mr. Kim Dan? I mean, Angel Dan.

252
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,170
Don't be surprised.

253
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:36,320
I have surprising news to deliver to you.

254
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,360
You're a fearless angel that's fooling around.

255
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,260
Who are you?

256
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,950
How could a human know the secrets of our realm?

257
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:50,030
Should we start with that? What is your mission?

258
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,500
Why did you approach Yeon Seo?

259
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,310
Forget it. Just don't ever show up again.

260
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:59,830
If you meet up with Yeon Seo again, then Yeon Seo

261
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:02,920
will get to know about your disgusting identity.

262
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,680
Are you threatening me?

263
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,770
It's a warning.

264
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:13,120
You told me the last time to make Yeon Seo happy.

265
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,450
I'll do that.

266
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:19,410
I'll stay next to Yeon Seo forever and give her love and happiness,

267
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:23,150
so relax and get out of my way.

268
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,210
Recording?

269
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:37,320
Are you sure?

270
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,440
You did well.

271
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,920
I think she'll rig the audition, too.

272
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,510
I'll prepare the evidence.

273
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:48,330
Yes.

274
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:50,140
Chief Park.

275
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:00,200
Did the CEO send you here?

276
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:04,480
No. You came to me when you were restless.

277
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,060
Why did you not answer my calls?

278
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,970
Give it to me.

279
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,750
Are you really going to blow the whistle or something?

280
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:18,550
You once told me that you feel stuck.

281
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:23,720
I decided to resign,

282
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:27,420
even though it will be scary and time-consuming.

283
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,110
You will understand, right?

284
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,320
Why are you doing this?

285
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,880
Why are you doing this, CEO?

286
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,520
Don't do this, Hyung.

287
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:45,030
Gwang Il, can't you save me this once?

288
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:48,120
Our Ni Na is right at the corner.

289
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:52,550
The performance with Director Ji is a once in a lifetime opportunity.

290
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:57,020
You know it, too. My daughter is innocent and pure like white snow.

291
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,330
They didn't do anything wrong.

292
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:00,350
I know that.

293
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:03,790
I know that Ni Na is too kind to even kill a bug.

294
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,750
Wait a little bit.

295
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:10,150
After this is all over, after "Giselle" premiers, you won't have to step up. I'll turn myself in.

296
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:13,340
I will go to the police on my own accord.

297
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:19,210
I will take the punishment. I beg you, Gwang Il.

298
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:23,140
You're also a father. You understand my feelings, right?

299
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,350
I'm sorry. Where were we up to?

300
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:39,100
So you were on the lighting team three years ago, right?

301
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,490
Moon Jae Wook?

302
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,790
My goodness, man.

303
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:55,450
I'm serious. I know Ji Kang Wook. It's really urgent.

304
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,120
But you said you don't even know the room number.

305
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,720
There's something important in there.

306
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,940
I was going to call the police, but I decided to let him–

307
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,640
All right. That's it. That's it. Just go back.

308
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,610
Mister, just give me ten minutes.

309
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:05,680
No, seven, five minutes.

310
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,040
if you keep doing this, I'm going to call the police.

311
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,290
Please!

312
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:10,760
Hello.

313
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,280
Ji Kang Wook, do you know this person?

314
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,830
He keeps on insisting that he knows you.

315
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,180
He's my friend.

316
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,470
I'm going in. Thanks for your work.

317
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:23,300
Yes, of course.

318
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:34,650
I'll explain.

319
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:38,190
It's fine. I don't need your explanation.

320
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,380
Oh, how bright.

321
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,160
Senior!

322
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,240
Follow me.

323
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,600
Thanks, Senior.

324
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,500
I don't even know why I'm being like this.

325
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,490
I think you rubbed off on me.

326
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:18,340
Ji Kang Wook definitely has a secret.

327
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,690
He's not a normal person.

328
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,710
Hel—.

329
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:46,120
   

330
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,960
What is this?
    

331
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,020
   

332
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,340
   

333
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:19,890
What is it?

334
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:24,960
Please forgive me.

335
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,010
   

336
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:28,780
   

337
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:43,010
Isn't that Noisy Gong?

338
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:45,120
No.

339
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:49,370
This person isn't Yeon Seo.

340
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,560
Then, who is it?

341
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:11,410
Are you disregarding me and inviting yourself now?

342
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:14,980
Why did you deceive me?

343
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:17,960
Just because their faces are similar, you're obsessing over them?

344
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,680
- Shut up! 
 - You...

345
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:27,490
I thought you were Yeon Seo's missing Rib.

346
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:30,210
I believed you were her destiny.

347
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:35,250
Once Yeon Seo falls in love with her Rib and finds happiness,

348
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:38,230
I thought that I would be able to leave peacefully.

349
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,790
I told you that I know.

350
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:43,360
Everything is settled. Mission success.

351
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,800
No, I don't need it.

352
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,820
You're disqualified.

353
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:54,420
I wanted to tell you that the one who should stop lurking around her is you, not me.

354
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:59,340
Listen to the angel's orders and obey.

355
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,900
So, what are you going to do?

356
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:09,030
Are you going to be her Rib?

357
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:10,780
It's none of your business.

358
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:15,550
If I turn into dust or dissipate, that's for me to deal with.

359
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,460
You'll be very lucky if you just dissipate.

360
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,740
You won't be able to imagine what type of punishment you will receive.

361
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:28,780
Something horrendous will happen.

362
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:33,720
He will come.

363
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,690
He will not.

364
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:39,540
He'll come.

365
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,620
He won't come.

366
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:45,170
What is this? Let me start over.

367
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:48,730
This time I'll start with "He will not come."

368
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:50,750
He will not come.

369
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,690
He will come.

370
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,650
He won't come.

371
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:57,880
This is seriously...

372
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:19,010
You're here?

373
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:21,220
I'm sorry I'm late.

374
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:29,200
Are you done?

375
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:32,430
You're not going anymore, right?

376
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:40,040
If you dare to quit, fool around, or disappear, you'll die.

377
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,950
Do you understand?

378
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:46,580
You can't get sick without telling me either.

379
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:49,670
You can't die without me.

380
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:51,590
You understand?

381
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:56,940
Why aren't you saying anything?

382
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,010
Promise me.

383
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:07,520
  You won't be able to imagine what type of punishment you'll receive.  

384
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:11,600
  You will be given a horrendous punishment. 

385
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:14,830
I love you.

386
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:21,600
I love you, Lee Yeon Seo.

387
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:28,600


388
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:38,700
♫  Tonight stars are pouring down, while I think of you alone,  ♫

389
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:46,410
♫  Will you know I feel infatuated?  ♫

390
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:50,720
♫  On a night when cherry blossoms are scattering,  ♫

391
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,450
♫  Through the warm wind under the moonlight,  ♫

392
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:59,570
♫  I long for you all alone  ♫

393
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:04,780
♫  I wish my longing could reach you  ♫

394
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:12,190
♫  I wish this will be the end of the nights without you  ♫

395
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:17,120
     

396
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,970
♫  Tonight stars are pouring down,  ♫

397
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:24,270
 It's not a crime to love a lot, but it's a crime to have too many secrets. 

398
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:26,170
 Yeon Seo! 

399
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:27,920
 MIss! 

400
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,360
 Oh! Ms. Jeong! 

401
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:33,350
 Yeon Seo, listen to my every word from now on. 

402
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:36,120
 Do you know about guardian angels? 

403
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:39,900
 The best thing you can do for her is to leave her. 

404
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,890
 There must be another way 

405
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,410
 for an angel to become a human. 

406
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:46,980
 I wish Yeon Seo was dead. 

407
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,860
 Yeon Seo! 

408
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:51,333
♫  I long for you all alone  ♫
