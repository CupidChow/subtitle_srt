1
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,588
Do you like me that much?

2
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,180
Funny, isn't it?

3
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,898
A tragedy turns into a comedy.

4
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:09,944
Then something you thought
was a comedy turns into a tragedy.

5
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,200
LADY YEON-SEO

6
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,284
Yeon-seo.

7
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,955
It would have been great
if you continued to be blind.

8
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,334
Receiving those corneas
to get your vision back...

9
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,294
That luck

10
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:29,047
is actually your tragedy.

11
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,509
If you remained as a pretty doll,

12
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:34,928
who lived her life as if she was dead,

13
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:38,515
you wouldn't have had to die so soon.

14
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,028
I love you,

15
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:53,738
Yeon-seo.

16
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:54,948
What do you want to see?

17
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,325
The river, the sea, trees, fields,
tell me anything you want.

18
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:58,368
I'll take you there. Okay?

19
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:00,870
I have to see

20
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,956
the river, the sea,

21
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,250
trees, and fields.

22
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,086
I wanted to see those things with you.

23
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,338
Dan.

24
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,111
Are you okay?

25
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,116
Look at me, Yeon-seo.

26
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,244
It's me.

27
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,539
Dan.

28
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,710
Yes, it's me.

29
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:51,963
So

30
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:53,965
relax.

31
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:56,551
It's

32
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,095
all right.

33
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:01,806
Is it

34
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,143
really you?

35
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,689
And these wings.

36
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:15,361
You flew

37
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,031
from over there?

38
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:23,786
What...

39
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:26,915
What...

40
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,376
What are...

41
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,009
you?

42
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:29,018
You reported, right?

43
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,311
Where are you?

44
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,438
I do not see anyone who fell down.

45
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,900
I'm sorry, it must be the rain.

46
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:37,860
I think I saw something wrong.

47
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:40,863
A false alarm.

48
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,116
No one fell down. Let's go.

49
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,159
-Let's go.
-Get moving.

50
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,301
DIRECTOR JI, I'M SORRY
I FEEL TOO BURDENED...

51
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:17,608
Where are you?

52
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:19,402
We need to meet.

53
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,113
I'm sorry

54
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:07,950
that I was too late

55
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:10,828
and that you had to find out like this.

56
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,586
Mom?

57
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,338
Dad?

58
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,340
Mr. Cho?

59
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,050
Dan?

60
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,534
Are you done?

61
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:51,285
Well...

62
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:52,995
I did push her off,

63
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,539
but she wasn't there.

64
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,083
What do you mean?

65
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,544
I didn't see her there
or any traces of someone moving her.

66
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,462
What kind of nonsense is this?

67
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:04,215
I'm not sure what's going on either.

68
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,467
Come here immediately. Come and tell me.

69
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,095
No, I'll take care of this
before I go there.

70
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,058
He pushed her off,

71
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:17,395
but she's not there?

72
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,086
Come to that place this instant.

73
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:04,812
You really came. Sit down.

74
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:06,314
Would you like a drink?

75
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,815
Did you make a toast?

76
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,526
-What?
-I thought you cared

77
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,361
about your sister.

78
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:13,613
You look very relaxed.

79
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:14,697
Or

80
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,408
did something good happen?

81
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:21,579
Director Ji.

82
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,541
Didn't Ni-na do so well today?

83
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,501
Imagine how heartbroken she must be

84
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:29,795
when she gave it her all.

85
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,548
That's why I'm drinking.

86
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,634
Was it wrong of me to do so?

87
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,766
What is this?

88
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,730
Yeon-seo...

89
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:49,690
Did she really send this?

90
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,526
Where is she? Why are you here?

91
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,445
It must've been
General Director Choi's order.

92
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,280
She's always despised Yeon-seo.

93
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,200
And despite all the bribing,
Yeon-seo won at the audition.

94
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:00,451
Has she

95
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,828
chosen to get rid of her once and for all?

96
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,664
Director Ji, what are you--

97
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:08,459
Your family's the only one
with a good enough reason

98
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,002
to do something like this.

99
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:17,718
Did you

100
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,179
just smile?

101
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:22,223
Director Ji.

102
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,810
This world isn't that simple.

103
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:29,980
Resentment and sugarcoating
aren't always everything.

104
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:33,192
There are even some people
who commit murder

105
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:37,196
just because they didn't like
the way they were looked at.

106
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:42,827
Is Yeon-seo alive?

107
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,453
Is she badly injured?

108
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,622
You're curious
about whether she's alive or not.

109
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,208
I didn't even tell you what happened.

110
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,545
You showed me the text.

111
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,798
She felt too pressured,
so she wanted to end it.

112
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,179
This is my last warning.
Don't you touch her

113
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,182
ever again.

114
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:18,404
You're alive?

115
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,917
What was your plan? Were you going
to let the entire world know?

116
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,670
We've been disguising
all the incidents as accidents.

117
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:36,881
But if you kill her yourself,

118
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,883
both of us will go down.

119
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:41,343
I'm sorry. I just wanted to wrap it--

120
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,846
Enough with your excuses.
Lie low for the time being.

121
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,973
Don't try anything rash.

122
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,977
Don't be foolish. Do you understand?

123
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,438
Yes, ma'am.

124
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,545
Why are You so cruel?

125
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,052
Please

126
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,971
pity them.

127
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:57,878
Are you awake?

128
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,714
How do you feel?

129
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:02,716
Can you get up?

130
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,010
Have you been here all night

131
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,471
because of what happened yesterday?

132
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:12,810
Yeon-seo.

133
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,020
Listen carefully. Yesterday, you--

134
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,981
What happened?

135
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,032
I can't remember.

136
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,619
The last thing I remember
is going to the park with you.

137
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,291
Did I faint?

138
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,087
Do you really not remember?

139
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,797
You don't remember at all?

140
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,219
My body feels sore.

141
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,806
But it's always been sore every morning.

142
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,101
Tell me. What happened?

143
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:00,983
Ms. Lee!

144
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,654
Oh, right, the appointment
with Ms. Jung. You called her, right?

145
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:06,906
What?

146
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:08,782
Yes.

147
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,285
Wait for me outside.
I'll take a shower and come out.

148
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,295
Don't treat me like a kid
just because I fainted once.

149
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,011
I'll wait outside.

150
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,907
He must be very worried.

151
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,295
Please stay close to her.

152
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,089
Especially when
she's at the ballet theater.

153
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,883
-And about her room--
-What's going on?

154
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,345
I've decided to reinforce
our security team starting today.

155
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,180
They'll be on the watch
24 hours a day in 3 shifts.

156
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:16,934
I told you I don't want
to be watched all day.

157
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:18,769
I have no choice.

158
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:21,647
You left me waiting in the rain
and didn't even pick up your phone.

159
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,233
Dan told me that he called you.

160
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,360
He did. Extremely late.

161
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:29,738
And the first thing he said
was to call our security team.

162
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,742
I knew it was you.

163
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,828
He's overreacting. Don't listen to him.

164
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,539
Still, it's better safe than sorry.

165
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,374
What's so wrong about being careful?

166
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,002
Let's do this for the time being.
Just one week, please?

167
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,630
I remembered everything.

168
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,550
I know what happened yesterday.

169
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,523
Let's go inside and talk.

170
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:05,691
The red balloon.

171
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,526
Yeon-seo!

172
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,446
You were holding it across the street.

173
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,868
That's when I fainted, right?

174
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,540
I only remember up until that part.

175
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,167
I fainted at that moment.

176
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:28,130
Is she remembering something
that didn't even occur?

177
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:29,840
It can't be.

178
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,968
You don't have to be too worried
just because I fainted once.

179
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:34,344
You see,

180
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,556
all I need is you.

181
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,479
You can whisper sweet nothings
in his ear when you're alone.

182
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,772
There's only one of Dan.

183
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:48,192
If you want him next to you,
we need other people to watch the house.

184
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,614
The security team will start
their patrol starting today.

185
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:08,587
Where's Ni-na?

186
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,673
She left to practice at dawn.

187
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,176
She must've cried all night.

188
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:15,761
And you let her go?

189
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:18,555
It's not over yet. She needs to practice.

190
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,433
Did you even do your job?

191
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,019
Why were we missing 2 votes
when you've acquired 13 of them?

192
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,355
I told you that it couldn't be guaranteed.

193
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:28,774
Are you saying we'll have to give up

194
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,193
the foundation and the position of
the prima ballerina?

195
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:34,113
No. I won't allow that.

196
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,322
It's the same for Ni-na.

197
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,241
A dancer who has had a taste
of the spotlight

198
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,451
can never return to being nothing
but a shadow.

199
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:40,786
She will make it.

200
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,538
She will perform for Giselle.

201
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:44,998
How?

202
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:46,917
I'll have

203
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,002
to look for a way.

204
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,299
But for today, let's get ready
to meet our new Giselle.

205
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,981
What are you doing?

206
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,066
No.

207
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,776
I said I'm fine.

208
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,486
You fainted. You need to rest.

209
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,364
How could the prima ballerina miss out
on her first practice after the audition?

210
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:19,158
You have your reasons. Don't go there.

211
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,368
-Give it back to me.
-No, listen to me.

212
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,959
Are you that worried?

213
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:33,964
It's killing me.

214
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,060
JI KANG-WOO

215
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,315
-This is Kim Dan.
-Put Yeon-seo on the phone.

216
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,193
You can talk to me. I'm her secretary.

217
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,486
How are you still her secretary?

218
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,864
Did you show her your wings
and threaten her?

219
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:03,202
Stop talking nonsense.
If that's all, I'm hanging up.

220
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,164
Director Ji, this is Lee Yeon-seo.

221
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:08,999
Why didn't you call me directly?

222
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,585
I called you to tell you
to take a day off today.

223
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,837
Why? Was the practice canceled?

224
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,255
I'm sure you were shocked.

225
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,049
Take the day off.
I'll see you after you rest up.

226
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,219
I'll be looking into
what happened yesterday.

227
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,348
What will you be looking into?

228
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,267
Why is everyone making a fuss?
I'm all right.

229
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,312
-But yesterday, you--
-I just fainted. That's all.

230
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,814
I guess my secretary must have told
you what had happened.

231
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,149
Please forget what he told you.

232
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,363
Fainted?

233
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,578
-Yeon-seo.
-I must've dropped my phone in the park.

234
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:47,496
Let's go back.

235
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:50,249
-Let's just buy a new one.
-No, I have to find it.

236
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:52,918
Why?

237
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:15,774
Forget it. I'll go by myself.

238
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:18,652
You're the one who has been following me
around like a puppy since this morning.

239
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,028
Why don't you want to follow me now?

240
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,115
I'll go to the park.

241
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:24,741
I'll find it.

242
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,119
Stay here until I come back.
Don't go anywhere.

243
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:28,620
Promise me.

244
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,581
Okay.

245
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,583
I promise.

246
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:04,948
I'm glad that you both are here.

247
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:06,908
What is this about?

248
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,327
I need to ask something.

249
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:12,414
"Director Ji, I'm sorry.

250
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,791
I feel too burdened
and I don't feel confident.

251
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,168
I think this is my limit.

252
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:18,378
I will end everything
at the ballet theater

253
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,380
that I loved."

254
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:22,466
What is that?

255
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,427
Please don't tell me
that the text is from Ni-na.

256
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,180
What do you think you're doing?

257
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:30,724
This is a text message from Lee Yeon-seo.

258
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,392
No, to be accurate,

259
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,812
it's a text message by a kidnapper
who took her yesterday.

260
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:40,609
Ru-na.

261
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,320
This is horrendous.
What on earth happened?

262
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,866
I thought we were done
talking about it yesterday.

263
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:51,912
Accusing us with a text message
is enough to charge you for defamation.

264
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:55,165
So did something happen to Yeon-seo?

265
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:56,458
Nothing happened.

266
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,210
How do you know that?

267
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,295
Director Ji, you wouldn't be here

268
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:01,963
if there was an accident.

269
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:04,841
So

270
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:07,094
Yeon-seo had been kidnapped,

271
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,554
and you think we were
the ones behind that?

272
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,431
Bring us the evidence.

273
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:14,893
No. If you do find evidence,
go to the police station right away.

274
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:16,520
Don't bother me. It's exhausting.

275
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:20,440
I plan to do that,
but I'm here to warn you in advance.

276
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:24,277
Director Ji, come to your senses.
We're not behind the kidnapping.

277
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:25,278
Why would you warn us?

278
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:29,116
I thought about what you two must want

279
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:30,992
to go to such lengths.

280
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:34,371
Come in.

281
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,506
Why are you here?

282
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,591
Director Ji asked me to come in.

283
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:48,552
He said he had to tell me something.

284
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:51,638
There's something you must know, Ni-na.

285
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,015
Look, Director Ji.

286
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,310
What is it?

287
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,938
You've never contacted me personally.

288
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:01,857
What is this about?

289
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,028
You were great.

290
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,531
Your performance yesterday was excellent.

291
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,908
You were the Giselle I dreamed of.

292
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,660
You were impressive, Ni-na.

293
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,291
You two

294
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,294
would do anything for Ni-na.

295
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,045
That's how much you love her.

296
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:27,549
That's why I wanted to say this
in front of you two as well.

297
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:29,259
Well done.

298
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:30,468
Bye.

299
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,961
KIM DAN

300
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,588
She's adorable.

301
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,887
"Director Ji, I'm sorry.

302
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:16,223
I feel too burdened
and I don't feel confident.

303
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:20,101
I will end everything
at the ballet theater that I loved."

304
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:40,914
What's your plan?

305
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:57,889
They tried

306
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:01,059
to hurt a person.

307
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:04,896
They are her family.
They are her only family left.

308
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,066
Her family did that.

309
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,194
So are you going to hurt people
just like them?

310
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,197
How long do you think
He will put up with you?

311
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,991
"The day of the Lord
will come like a thief."

312
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,158
Be careful.

313
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:22,414
You knew, didn't you?

314
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,249
Were you just staring at her?

315
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:27,419
Were you the one
who got rid of Yeon-seo's memory?

316
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:51,401
Why did you erase her memory?

317
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,320
You told me not to do anything to humans!

318
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,196
Why did you spread your wings
in front of a human?

319
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,448
This is all your fault.

320
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:58,491
I was going to tell her.

321
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,035
I was going to tell her the truth anyway.

322
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:04,456
Whether she accepts me or not,
that depends on Yeon-seo.

323
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:05,832
Why did you erase her memory?

324
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:07,959
Instead of trembling in fear
with that awful memory,

325
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,544
it's better not to know anything.

326
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:11,338
The moment she knows that you're an angel,

327
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:13,173
Noisy Gong and you
won't be able to stay together.

328
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,056
That's cowardly of you.

329
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:22,724
I didn't know

330
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:26,019
an angel could be such a coward.

331
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:31,316
Angels are meant to be only bystanders.

332
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:33,401
So if

333
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:37,405
it is her fate to be murdered by someone,

334
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:38,865
you must accept it.

335
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,035
That makes no sense.

336
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,162
If I can save her, I should.

337
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,039
That's a good deed.

338
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:47,916
And that's our job.

339
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:52,837
No.

340
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:55,423
Bringing confusion into this world
is considered evil.

341
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,302
Someone will be a sacrifice
of another's criminal act.

342
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:02,764
And someone will die
at the peak of their life.

343
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,641
And some people will live for 100 years.

344
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:06,684
But some people die
as soon as they are born.

345
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:09,062
Those are the fates of humans!

346
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:14,776
I can't understand this.

347
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:17,487
I was told everyone is important.

348
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:19,030
He loves them.

349
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,450
Then, no one should face
such an unfair death.

350
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,244
But the deity

351
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:26,371
and angels like us

352
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:31,501
won't take responsibility
and just watch as it happens?

353
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:33,795
If you think we're irresponsible,

354
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,006
that means you're selfish.

355
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:38,967
Look into your heart.

356
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:42,345
You don't want to save everyone
who dies in wrongful death.

357
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:45,140
You only want to save
just one person, Lee Yeon-seo.

358
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,272
Don't try to tell Noisy Gong who you are.

359
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:54,983
You don't have time to be greedy.

360
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,431
Yeon-seo, are you up?

361
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,682
Let's eat breakfast.

362
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,044
I'm going to practice.

363
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,267
Congratulations, Yeon-seo.

364
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:13,770
Yes, congratulations.

365
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,022
That was an excellent Giselle.

366
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:20,610
Thank you.

367
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:23,029
Right.

368
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:26,282
Are you looking after
the health of our corps?

369
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,493
Include physical therapy
and massages in their schedule.

370
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:30,328
-I'm still managing the theater--
-Of course.

371
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:32,539
Let me know if you want anything.
I'll make it happen.

372
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,376
I look forward to working with you.

373
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,047
Me too, Associate Director Keum.

374
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:43,258
Goodness, did you get hurt?

375
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:47,804
I heard you took a sick leave yesterday
and skipped practice.

376
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,264
Did something happen

377
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:50,557
on the day of the audition?

378
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,686
No, nothing happened.

379
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:55,770
I'll go inside.

380
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:58,022
Be back here on time.

381
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:04,779
Maybe Director Ji lied.

382
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:08,825
She looks so indifferent
after she has been supposedly abducted.

383
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,119
He probably got something wrong.

384
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,537
Don't let it get to you.

385
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,330
We can just ignore this,

386
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:17,333
but Ni-na is too weak hearted.

387
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,970
Where are you? Why haven't I
heard from you for two days?

388
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:30,555
You told me to go off the grid.

389
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:32,682
What are you talking about? When?

390
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,851
-On that night, I--
-Are you ill?

391
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,227
Are you seeing things?

392
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:37,896
Yeon-seo is fine.

393
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:41,316
She fell from a ten-story building,
but she walked in with all of her limbs.

394
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,902
You said you'd take care of this.
What did you do?

395
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:45,236
I'm sorry.

396
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:46,779
Tell me.

397
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:48,698
Did she

398
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:50,491
see your face?

399
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:56,039
Okay, I'm hanging up.

400
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:13,264
I can't believe this.

401
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:14,515
Yeon-seo is fine.

402
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:17,685
She fell from a ten-story building,
but she walked in with all of her limbs.

403
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:20,271
You said you'd take care of this.
What did you do?

404
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:21,648
No.

405
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:23,775
No.

406
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:25,318
No!

407
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:26,653
No.

408
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:28,404
No.

409
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:29,697
Hello.

410
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:46,631
Excuse me.

411
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,994
You dropped your cigarettes.

412
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:21,290
This ballet theater
is a smoke-free building.

413
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,461
Yes, right. I'm sorry.

414
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:32,552
I'm your fan.

415
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:33,803
Keep up your good work.

416
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:41,769
What was that?

417
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,355
That was odd.

418
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,440
Yeon-seo!

419
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:49,610
Why did you run over?

420
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,237
Why won't you listen to me?

421
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,531
I thought my heart was going to stop!

422
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,659
I just came to work.
Why would that make your heart stop?

423
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,161
I asked you. I pleaded with you.

424
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:00,204
I told you to take a few days off.
Why did you...

425
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,416
You should have told me
that you're leaving.

426
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:04,667
Why did you come here alone?

427
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,169
Because you're like this.

428
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,629
I knew you won't let me go,
so how could I tell you?

429
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:10,089
I was going to call.

430
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,466
But I didn't have a phone, so...

431
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:14,218
Right, did you find my phone?

432
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:18,931
I did.

433
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,519
But it's all broken.
You should just get a new one.

434
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:25,563
And?

435
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:27,732
You threw it out?

436
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,150
On your call?

437
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:31,611
No, I didn't.

438
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:33,279
You're unbelievable.

439
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:36,282
You do things as you want,
but you are telling me that I can't.

440
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:37,617
Even if we're

441
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:40,912
in such a relationship,

442
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:43,498
I'm not yours.
You have no right to do that.

443
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:44,749
I know, but--

444
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:46,167
You're really weird.

445
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:49,253
You've been treating me
like a three-year-old baby

446
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,881
who is trying to walk on a tightrope.

447
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:53,883
And you've been angry at me.

448
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:57,595
You should go.

449
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:00,056
Hey, Dan.

450
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:01,849
What's wrong?

451
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:04,769
What did I do wrong?

452
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,193
It's not you.

453
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:13,945
I'm not angry at you.

454
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:15,363
I'm angry at myself.

455
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,869
Come here after work. I'll wait for you.

456
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:23,704
Don't go home alone.

457
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,248
I'll meet you here.

458
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:26,499
Okay?

459
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:38,719
What was that?

460
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:47,895
It was you people, wasn't it?

461
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:50,314
What did you do to Yeon-seo?

462
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:54,443
She just thinks she collapsed on that day.

463
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:56,988
You messed around with her memory?

464
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:59,365
It already happened and it was horrendous.

465
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,408
So

466
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:03,286
you should be careful too.

467
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:05,705
This is why I hate it.

468
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:07,498
Something awful always happens

469
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:09,458
when you get involved with an angel.

470
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:14,797
-Watch your mouth.
-You should have left

471
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,048
when I told you to get lost.

472
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:17,383
Your senior or that deity of yours

473
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:19,093
is messing with things
to try to fix everything

474
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,387
because you've been lurking around her.

475
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:23,139
Why do you despise angels so much?

476
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:24,640
What happened to you?

477
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:30,938
Fantasia is like

478
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,566
a lion's den to Yeon-seo. So...

479
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:35,985
please look after her

480
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:37,987
when I'm not around.

481
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,740
Who do you think you are to ask me that?
I'll take care of it myself.

482
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,146
I'm not putting this on.

483
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:16,651
I'm not playing Myrtha.

484
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:18,569
No, I can't.

485
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:22,823
Su-ji is Bathilde. Jeong-eun is Mom.

486
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,742
U-jin is Hilarion. Yi-geon is Albrecht.

487
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:26,827
Ni-na is Myrtha.

488
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:28,663
Didn't you see the announcement?

489
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,790
I don't want to play another role.

490
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,834
-What do you mean?
-I want to do Giselle's dance.

491
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:36,587
So I will not take on any other roles.

492
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,172
I will practice the same dance

493
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:40,716
that Yeon-seo dances as her understudy.

494
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,556
Myrtha will perform on stage.

495
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,684
But if you choose
to be Giselle's understudy,

496
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:50,851
you may not end up performing.

497
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,103
And you're okay with that?

498
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:53,854
Yes.

499
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,109
There can be only one Giselle
for Fantasia's 2019 performance.

500
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,038
Ni-na.

501
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:15,584
What are you thinking?

502
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,549
It's exactly what I just said.

503
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,926
During the audition, I truly felt

504
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,554
like I was Giselle.

505
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:30,516
I've never felt that way before.
It was as if I came out of my shell.

506
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:33,936
Yet, you still won't choose me

507
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,230
even though I was the Giselle
you dreamed of.

508
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:38,524
I'm still not good enough.

509
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:43,029
I'm going to accept that.

510
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:44,822
Even if you're not Giselle,

511
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,867
there are many people
who are waiting to watch your dance.

512
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:49,785
You should be Myrtha.

513
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:50,870
Don't be fooled.

514
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,497
I bet he'll offer a different role.

515
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:55,750
But you should not accept it.

516
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:59,420
If I don't, I won't be able
to dance on stage.

517
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:02,298
You can never know beforehand
who will not be able to appear on stage.

518
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:05,468
Insist on playing Giselle no matter what.

519
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:06,594
Okay?

520
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:08,721
No.

521
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,514
I want to appear on stage

522
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:12,600
as Giselle.

523
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,677
If you see someone,
you should greet them first.

524
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:50,221
Only when they deserve it.

525
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:52,932
Only when you start acting humanely

526
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:54,934
will I show you respect.

527
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,603
What are you saying?

528
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:01,774
Are you saying that
I'm not even a human being?

529
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:13,452
Hey! Where are you going?

530
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:25,172
Ru-na, what are you trying to do?

531
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:33,180
It's him. I need to catch him.

532
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,425
What's wrong with you?

533
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:12,261
It's you, right?
Don't you know Lee Yeon-seo?

534
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:14,346
What are you talking about? She is...

535
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:16,599
She's a ballerina here.

536
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:17,558
Don't feign ignorance.

537
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:20,561
Both on that ship and during the audition,
you were targeting her.

538
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,730
Who sent you? Who gave you the orders?

539
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,648
Seriously, what's wrong with you?

540
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:27,568
My gosh. What's going on?

541
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:29,820
Jun-su, is that you?

542
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:30,905
Sir.

543
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:32,865
Get off me.

544
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:36,869
What's going on?

545
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,374
Goodness.

546
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:45,377
So you're saying, he attacked you

547
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:47,254
because he thought you were a bad guy?

548
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:49,131
He started following me,

549
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:51,091
so I got scared.

550
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:52,927
That's why I ran.

551
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:56,180
Where were you from 4 p.m. to 11 p.m.
on the day of the audition?

552
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:00,142
He was working with me.

553
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:02,520
He wanted to switch shifts with us.

554
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:07,024
Jun-su is an angel.

555
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:10,402
He definitely is.

556
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,112
Are you happy now?

557
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:16,617
I'm sorry.

558
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:19,620
It's okay. I understand.

559
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:22,498
I do hope you catch him though.

560
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:26,627
I'm really sorry.

561
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:28,063
Have you gone insane? Why are you here?

562
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:30,274
Yeon-seo is practicing right now.

563
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:32,735
I know. That's why I'm here.

564
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:34,194
In order to find out

565
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:36,280
whether she's pretending
not to remember or not,

566
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:38,574
I'll have to show myself to her.

567
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:39,908
What if you get caught?

568
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:42,536
Then I'll tell them that
I did everything single-handedly.

569
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:43,829
Jun-su.

570
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:46,832
I won't let you end up
behind bars ever again.

571
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:54,965
Anyway, since we know for sure now
that Yeon-seo doesn't recognize you,

572
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:56,592
don't act rashly.

573
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:57,926
Act normally.

574
00:43:58,469 --> 00:43:59,470
Yes, ma'am.

575
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:20,157
Hello, I'm on my way.
It'll take 30 minutes.

576
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:22,242
I'm only going to look for props.

577
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:23,786
Okay, I'll see you later.

578
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:46,684
What was that?

579
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:51,105
Since when?

580
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,191
Since when were you scheming
to harm Yeon-seo?

581
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:56,819
What are you talking about?

582
00:44:57,528 --> 00:45:00,572
Yeon-seo is dancing
in the practice room right now.

583
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:02,616
So you'll feign ignorance?

584
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:07,037
What's gotten into you?
Are you deluded like she is?

585
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:08,872
You're the one who's deluded.

586
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:10,499
You believe you can deceive everyone.

587
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:13,419
You believe that you'll be happy
getting what you want

588
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:15,879
even if it's through evil means.

589
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:18,424
Now, I've finally realized

590
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:21,927
that you have a heinous soul
within that beautiful shell of yours.

591
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:24,304
So...

592
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:32,896
You'll never be able

593
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:35,232
to harm her again.

594
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,026
Not on my watch.

595
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:55,377
I'll see you tomorrow!

596
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:10,809
He told me not to be alone.

597
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:12,686
Where is he?

598
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:17,941
Kim Dan.

599
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:20,652
Come out, Dan.

600
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:23,155
Come out.

601
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:38,545
What's with his face?

602
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:41,298
Is he still upset?

603
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,434
Stop. People might see us.

604
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:54,019
I'm going to protect you.

605
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:57,689
You'll never be alone ever again.

606
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:01,235
I'm really fine.

607
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:38,605
You should have told me
that you're leaving.

608
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:39,940
Why did you come here alone?

609
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:43,694
There's definitely

610
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,905
something going on.

611
00:48:56,933 --> 00:48:58,018
REPORT

612
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:08,153
Angel Kim Dan is
back to work from his vacation.

613
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,784
I wanted to tell her that I was an angel.

614
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:16,953
And she almost found out
that I am an angel.

615
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:18,830
However,

616
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:21,416
everything stemmed from my greed.

617
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:23,752
Perhaps,

618
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:26,755
I might fail my mission.

619
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:31,635
I might turn into dust.

620
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:36,056
However,

621
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,600
before that happens,

622
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:42,437
please allow me to keep my promise

623
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:44,147
that I'll protect her.

624
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:56,076
So

625
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:57,994
when you followed that suspicious man,

626
00:49:58,078 --> 00:49:59,871
you saw him meeting
with Associate Director Keum?

627
00:50:00,622 --> 00:50:03,417
I'm not sure if he is the one
that kidnapped Yeon-seo a few days ago,

628
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,837
but my suspicion of him won't go away,
so I decided to tell you.

629
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:08,004
But

630
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:11,341
why would she do that? I thought it
would be General Director Choi or Ni-na.

631
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:14,302
Evil behavior

632
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:17,055
doesn't need a good reason.

633
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:21,226
Ji-ung has to confirm this.

634
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,478
Gosh, I'm so stupid.

635
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:25,814
I should've gotten
the files the other day.

636
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,984
-Who?
-A guy who vanished into thin air.

637
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:35,741
Yes?

638
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:38,160
This is Jung Yu-mi.

639
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:42,414
What?

640
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:45,584
I'll be right there.

641
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:49,463
What is this about?

642
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:50,839
Please look after her.

643
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:57,429
Thank you for identifying his body.

644
00:50:57,512 --> 00:51:00,182
We didn't find any belongings
and thought this would take a while,

645
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:03,727
but luckily, we found
your business card in his pocket.

646
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:06,688
The autopsy result shows that
he had terminal cancer.

647
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:09,733
We'll close the case as a suicide
due to an unhappy life.

648
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:29,628
I'm here. What is it?

649
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:31,338
Are you sick? Do you need anything?

650
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:36,676
Can you clean my practice room for me?

651
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:38,929
I'm going to practice
all day today at home,

652
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:40,555
but I hate it when it's dirty.

653
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,225
I'm sure your housekeeper
probably cleaned it.

654
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:44,309
Can you do it?

655
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:46,061
That will help me feel at ease.

656
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:47,938
You'll do it, right?

657
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:51,775
Yes.

658
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:29,104
If you're not telling me what it is,
you must have a reason for it.

659
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:31,940
Then,

660
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:34,067
I'm going to find the reason.

661
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:02,679
He didn't throw it out.

662
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:06,016
Is it completely broken?

663
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:30,123
It's all done.

664
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:35,337
Do you need gloves? Do you want to check?

665
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,137
What's going on?

666
00:53:44,846 --> 00:53:45,931
You don't

667
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:50,268
truly love me.

668
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:54,356
What's gotten into you all of a sudden?

669
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:55,273
I...

670
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:57,901
trusted you to the end.

671
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,403
And I wanted to trust you.

672
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:06,868
Can you explain it? That way, I can
at least give you an explanation.

673
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:07,953
I don't need it.

674
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:10,997
Why would I explain it to you
when you won't do the same for me?

675
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:14,793
Don't even talk to me.

676
00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:17,379
Hey, Yeon-seo!

677
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:20,048
JI KANG-WOO

678
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:22,592
I'm busy. We can talk later.

679
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:23,718
I'm in front of the house.

680
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:32,227
Why are you here?

681
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:34,729
I told you to tell Yeon-seo that I'm here.

682
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:35,855
I need to talk to you.

683
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,610
I think Associate Director Keum

684
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:42,821
is after Yeon-seo.

685
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:45,365
I knew it.

686
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:47,492
-What?
-I mean

687
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:49,577
I suspected that it was her.

688
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:51,121
But why didn't you tell me?

689
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,416
What can you do?

690
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:56,543
How much time do you have left?

691
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:58,211
Two weeks? One month?

692
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:01,256
You'll only stay here for a few days
and go back to your realm.

693
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:03,550
On top of that, you're an angel.

694
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:07,387
If necessary, I can even kill those people

695
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:08,638
for Yeon-seo.

696
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:11,933
You cannot

697
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:14,811
repay evil with evil.

698
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:16,396
That only applies to angels like you.

699
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:17,939
A human like myself

700
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:20,859
isn't afraid of
the deity's judgment anymore.

701
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:22,110
You're not

702
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:24,487
afraid of it anymore?

703
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:25,780
There was

704
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:29,242
a young angel who thought he was special

705
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:30,702
just like you.

706
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:33,538
I knew it. You were him.

707
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:37,333
The young angel.

708
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:38,960
What matters now are the present

709
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:43,506
and the man who will stay
by Yeon-seo's side to the end.

710
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:45,759
When did you turn into a human?

711
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:49,471
No. How did you become a human?

712
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,056
No.

713
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:53,016
Can an angel

714
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:56,144
become a human being?

715
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:01,066
Answer me now.

716
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:02,942
What are you talking about

717
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:07,238
without me?

718
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:10,909
I asked him to call you.

719
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:12,911
I can only contact you
through your secretary.

720
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:17,707
I told him to go back.

721
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:19,834
You don't have anything
to talk about with him.

722
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:20,919
Let's go.

723
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:23,004
I need to talk to Director Ji.

724
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:26,257
Let me come with you.

725
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:27,509
Stay at home.

726
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:28,760
Why?

727
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:37,018
I have a secret just like you.

728
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:55,995
Darn it.

729
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:04,045
DIRECTOR JI, I'M SORRY

730
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:06,172
I've never sent that text message.

731
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:08,758
But you received that message from me.

732
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:14,681
I thought that
you probably didn't mean it.

733
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:16,141
Don't lie.

734
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:19,811
In hindsight, everything is odd.

735
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:21,062
I'm not the type

736
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:25,191
to easily faint
because I started to practice again.

737
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:28,069
I hate that you and Dan
are whispering to each other without me.

738
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:30,196
Tell me everything you know.

739
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:32,282
Do you remember

740
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:35,493
my friend I placed at the temple?

741
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:37,704
She died

742
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:39,414
right in front of me.

743
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:42,834
And...

744
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:50,925
this is the photo I took with her.

745
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:01,186
You two look alike.

746
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:03,354
The resemblance is uncanny.

747
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:07,400
Is this why

748
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:10,403
you insisted on working with me?

749
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:13,740
Director Ji,

750
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,075
I'm not her.

751
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:16,993
I know.

752
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:17,994
At first,

753
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:21,789
I thought you were her replacement.

754
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:23,333
But not anymore.

755
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,710
I love Lee Yeon-seo's dance.

756
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:27,337
And I love you as a person,

757
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:29,839
Yeon-seo.

758
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:34,260
You asked me to tell you
what happened on that night.

759
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:35,970
But I cannot tell you.

760
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:37,805
I will take care of it
without you knowing,

761
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:40,808
and I don't want you to remember
a tormenting memory.

762
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:42,810
"A tormenting

763
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:44,854
memory"?

764
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:47,774
And above all,
I don't want to lose you again

765
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:50,735
like that time.

766
00:58:58,701 --> 00:58:59,744
An angel

767
00:59:00,578 --> 00:59:01,829
became human.

768
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:06,417
An angel fell in love

769
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:09,546
and became human.

770
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:14,592
The moment she knows that you're an angel,

771
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:16,469
Noisy Gong and you
won't be able to stay together.

772
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:22,058
If I become human...

773
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:36,406
LADY YEON-SEO

774
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:49,335
Hello?

775
00:59:49,794 --> 00:59:51,629
It's me. Noisy Gong.

776
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:53,840
Where are you?
How did you find your phone?

777
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:56,342
I'm at the park where I fainted.

778
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:58,177
All alone? Where is Ji Kang-woo?

779
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:00,221
No one would tell me what happened,
so I just came here

780
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:02,348
thinking I might remember something.

781
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:05,059
I'll come over. Stay right there.

782
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:06,853
Let me ask you one last time.

783
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:10,231
Do you

784
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:13,276
really have nothing to say to me?

785
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:19,824
I'll tell you when I get there. No.

786
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:22,869
Let's keep talking on the phone
until I get there.

787
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:23,870
It's too late.

788
01:00:25,204 --> 01:00:26,539
I said it was the last time.

789
01:00:28,916 --> 01:00:30,585
Yeon-seo!

790
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:51,522
Yeon-seo!

791
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:05,286
May I ask you something?

792
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:07,163
Sure. Do you want something?

793
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:09,832
Do you remember the guy who bought
a red balloon here

794
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:11,250
a couple of days ago?

795
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:16,547
This guy.

796
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:19,384
Oh, this man.

797
01:01:19,884 --> 01:01:21,928
He bought an umbrella and a balloon.

798
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:23,304
Yes, that's him.

799
01:01:23,721 --> 01:01:24,764
What happened after that?

800
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:27,100
He ran around everywhere screaming

801
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:30,645
that his girlfriend suddenly went missing.

802
01:01:31,145 --> 01:01:32,313
I wonder if he found her.

803
01:01:33,272 --> 01:01:34,232
He said

804
01:01:35,483 --> 01:01:36,859
she went missing?

805
01:02:08,015 --> 01:02:09,392
Yeon-seo, are you okay?

806
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:12,186
Don't go around alone.
If anything, be with Ji Kang-woo.

807
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:13,521
Do you know how much I was worried?

808
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:19,026
Are you...

809
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:21,654
I'll tell you everything.

810
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:23,656
I didn't want to surprise you...

811
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:26,826
Dan.

812
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:31,372
Are you...

813
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:34,876
an angel?

814
01:02:41,674 --> 01:02:42,800
Answer me.

815
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:48,181
You can't lie.

816
01:02:52,226 --> 01:02:54,937
You don't truly love me.

817
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:56,856
The moment she knows that you're an angel,

818
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:58,733
Noisy Gong and you
won't be able to stay together.

819
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:00,318
I

820
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:03,529
trusted you to the end.

821
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:05,531
And I wanted to trust you.

822
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:12,955
Yes.

823
01:03:16,167 --> 01:03:17,251
I'm an angel.

824
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:57,166
Do you want me to stay with you tonight?

825
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:00,711
Pseudo-religious con artists.

826
01:04:00,878 --> 01:04:01,963
That is extremely insulting.

827
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:04,215
I came here to warn you
to never deceive me again.

828
01:04:04,298 --> 01:04:05,299
-Yes, we got it.
-Yes.

829
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:09,095
But still, as a human,
shouldn't she thank me first?

830
01:04:09,637 --> 01:04:11,722
I'll make sure
those who hurt you get punished.

831
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:13,474
I promise.

832
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:16,310
What do I need to do to become a human?

833
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:17,687
The deity is very jealous.

834
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:19,730
Kim Dan will dissipate

835
01:04:21,148 --> 01:04:22,316
because of your love.
