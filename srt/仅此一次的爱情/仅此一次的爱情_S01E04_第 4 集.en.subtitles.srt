1
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:01,686
There's the rude princess.

2
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,938
Do it with me right now. Let's dance.

3
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,315
-Okay.
-What's with you?

4
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:06,566
What are you doing?

5
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:10,653
Oh, gosh.

6
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,572
Alcoholic drinks.

7
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:15,200
It's the root of all evil!

8
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,412
Don't come near. I'm so ashamed.

9
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:20,538
Mr. Kim Dan?

10
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,044
You must come with us.

11
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,464
Hey, wait.

12
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:32,091
You know me. I'm an employee here.

13
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,301
I heard that you got fired.

14
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,512
Even so, you can't arrest me like this.

15
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,722
We have no choice.
We got a call for housebreaking.

16
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,349
-Let's go.
-Hey, let me go.

17
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,059
Hey! Lee Yeon-seo!

18
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,977
Hey, was it you? Did you do this?

19
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,562
We need to talk. Just for five minutes.

20
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:45,772
No, one minute.

21
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:48,108
-We'll get rid of him.
-If I have to leave, I will.

22
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,359
But not like this!

23
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,652
Stop being so loud.

24
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:51,653
One second.

25
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,783
Housebreaking? Reporting me to the police?

26
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,868
I know there's no hope
and you won't change your mind.

27
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:02,163
I wasn't going to try anything.
I was going to walk out of here myself!

28
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:04,874
I still trusted

29
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:08,419
that although you may not feel like I do,
that you would at least know how I feel.

30
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,421
I thought you would know I came

31
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,173
because I was worried
and felt sorry, you fool.

32
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,967
-You con man.
-What are you saying?

33
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,218
You nasty rat.

34
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,638
You said I was a pervert and a phony cult.
Now I'm a con--

35
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:19,848
You deceived me.

36
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,937
If you tell me the truth now,

37
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,606
I'll skip your dismissal,
filing a suit for damages,

38
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,525
a police investigation,
and a prosecution indictment.

39
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:32,902
I was always sincere.
I never lied, not even once.

40
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:36,489
I'm serious.

41
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,199
We have met before, haven't we?

42
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,118
Before you came for the interview.

43
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,161
When

44
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,121
I couldn't see.

45
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,458
Answer me. And do not lie.

46
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,399
Kim Dan. Who on earth are you?

47
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:13,109
Yes?

48
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,236
Why are you doing this to me?

49
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:17,113
Don't worry about it.

50
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:19,324
I'll make sure I make it happen.

51
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,200
I'll make sure Yeon-seo will...

52
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,831
I mean,

53
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,168
you shouldn't behave like that

54
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:33,171
just because you experienced a tragedy.

55
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,384
Not everyone behaves like you

56
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,136
after experiencing a tragedy.

57
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,638
If you tell me who was behind this,

58
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,056
I will forgive you.

59
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,599
I think it was an accident.

60
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:45,808
Why isn't this working?

61
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,061
My gosh, this isn't working.

62
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,449
It can't be...

63
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,701
Answer me, Kim Dan.

64
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,828
You already knew me before you came here.

65
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:11,751
Right.

66
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,090
Under the tree

67
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:18,883
on that rainy day.

68
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:21,302
Right?

69
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,513
It was a coincidence.

70
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,641
Of course, the deity planned
everything from the start.

71
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:28,017
You're just doing as you're told?

72
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,311
I was surprised to see
that it was you too.

73
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:34,941
Who sent you here?

74
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,447
From the one above.

75
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,077
So you only do as you're told?

76
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,287
Yeon-seo, it's--

77
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,330
That's why you said
I was your life's goal.

78
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,375
That's why you said
you existed because of me.

79
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:57,839
I guess you weren't lying.

80
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:00,133
I thought it could benefit you too.

81
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,926
How so? Being in a fix
for the rest of my life

82
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,803
because you scared me
by breaking the window?

83
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:06,973
What are you talking about?

84
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,183
They're pretty stupid too.

85
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:12,395
How can they send such a stupid spy?

86
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,610
You were pretty refreshing, though.

87
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,280
I'm done.

88
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,168
Let's go back to that night.

89
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,878
What did you use to break the window?

90
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,464
Did you cut off the light beforehand?

91
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:41,424
With a knife? A saw?

92
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,343
Let me be honest with you.

93
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:49,640
I'm the one who saved her that night.

94
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,519
The window broke,
and glass shards began to rain down.

95
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:54,479
I opened up my...

96
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,609
arms very wide.

97
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,904
So you fabricated that accident
to earn her trust?

98
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:11,370
Ms. Jung!

99
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,289
Let's not do this.

100
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,333
Let's call him back.

101
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:18,252
Do I have to explain everything again?
He deceived me.

102
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:19,504
He just didn't tell you.

103
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,214
It's not like he lied on purpose.

104
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:22,799
He answered all of your questions.

105
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,717
If he was going to hide it,
he wouldn't have told.

106
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,428
You're suspicious of everyone, aren't you?

107
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,222
Then how do you trust me?

108
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,433
Because you aren't nice to me.

109
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:35,603
Look at this.

110
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:38,439
What kind of a spy eats so much chocolate?

111
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:39,982
My gosh.

112
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,402
And he waited so much
for his birthday like a kid.

113
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:47,198
He probably had to kill me by that date.

114
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:50,535
Look at this.

115
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:53,579
He studied so much about you.

116
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,039
What is this?

117
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,583
"Love, dating,

118
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,710
feelings, and heart"?

119
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,921
"Love."

120
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:04,924
"Dating."

121
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:09,345
"Heart."

122
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:12,723
Goodness.

123
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:15,810
No way.

124
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,398
He didn't, did he?

125
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:22,608
What?

126
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:26,821
Falling in love with you at first sight.

127
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,659
He approached you carefully.

128
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,162
He wanted to

129
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,747
breathe the same air as you for a bit

130
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,833
so that he can have that
moment to cherish--

131
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,209
Nonsense.

132
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,671
He said someone above sent him here.

133
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,423
Yes, someone up there.

134
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,425
It might be destiny.

135
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,678
Is that how badly
you don't want to move in?

136
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,598
You said he hugged you.

137
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,559
He read the contract so meticulously

138
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,352
but broke the clause on
making physical contact.

139
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,571
That was because the glass broke--

140
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,656
He probably swore to just stay beside you

141
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,493
as your secretary and helper.

142
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,662
But he couldn't control his feelings.

143
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:17,997
Ms. Jung.

144
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,003
Please give that to him.

145
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,674
He said he was kicked out
and had nowhere to go.

146
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,885
I wonder where he is and what he's doing.

147
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,223
For him to have been dragged
to the police station,

148
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:37,099
he must've been really hurt.

149
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:38,351
I was always sincere.

150
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,061
I never lied, not even once.

151
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:42,980
You were pretty refreshing, though.

152
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:53,491
It didn't work.

153
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:01,541
This isn't your home.

154
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:02,708
Just for one night.

155
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,670
The police told me to go home,
but I had nowhere to go.

156
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,923
I told you not to return
until you've completed your mission.

157
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,510
I'm going to start soon.

158
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:15,972
I found her rib. Her man.
I just need to link them together.

159
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,181
Then why were you kicked out?

160
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,725
I set the stage for you
and cleaned up after you.

161
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,185
I've done my part.

162
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,187
Darn it!

163
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,731
I think my body is the issue.

164
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,611
Are you not like that?

165
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,863
When I hear her criticisms,
my blood pressure skyrockets.

166
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,365
But when I feel closer to her,

167
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:35,783
my face itches.

168
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:36,784
Goodness.

169
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,911
You must be so proud to have gotten fired

170
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,038
after being emotional like a human.

171
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,751
I was fired from my job,
but my mission is still ongoing.

172
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,754
I don't have to be beside her
when she falls in love, right?

173
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,465
Are you going to be
a matchmaker in secrecy?

174
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,636
That's a good idea.

175
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,096
What if I appeared in her dreams?

176
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:58,806
Don't be startled.

177
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:00,975
Look. A new world will unfold before you.

178
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:05,521
Love will blossom
in Yeon-seo's barren heart.

179
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,565
Isn't that amazing?

180
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,528
Darn it.

181
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,155
Hu!

182
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,907
Then at least give me some money!

183
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,576
Just 10,000 won! Or 5,000!

184
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,494
Come on!

185
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,289
I've been abandoned empty-handed

186
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,583
by both the deity and humans.

187
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,088
What would you like?

188
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:37,178
-Hot dogs!
-Hot dogs!

189
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:40,056
Go inside first. I'll buy them for you.

190
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,807
-Okay!
-Okay!

191
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,560
-Can I have 20 hotdogs to go?
-Okay.

192
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,020
Here.

193
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:47,855
Hey, did you watch that?

194
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:50,066
Keum Ni-na's SNS live broadcast
is on fire.

195
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,652
You mean Lee Yeon-seo?
She's such a rude wench.

196
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:53,903
She's notorious.

197
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,697
My friend who's in Fantasia told me
how awful she was.

198
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,115
She made others cry and even hit them.

199
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,950
Why? Her career won't last forever.

200
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,744
But her fortune will.

201
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,747
That's how she got the cornea transplant
and is so obnoxious.

202
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:06,123
Gosh, I envy her.

203
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,376
Out of all the people you could envy,

204
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,294
you choose to envy somebody
who is hated by everyone?

205
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:13,381
I bet she lost her vision
because karma got to her.

206
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,299
-Who is he?
-I'm sorry.

207
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:18,969
Thank you.

208
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,262
Lee Yeon-seo, that stupid gong.

209
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,555
-Goodbye.
-Thank you.

210
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,015
Did you see that?

211
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,892
-SNS live?
-My goodness.

212
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:25,935
"Awful Character"?

213
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:26,936
"Noise marketing"?

214
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,062
Let's see. It's this one.

215
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,357
BALLERINA LEE YEON-SEO'S AWFUL CHARACTER

216
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,942
-My gosh.
-Look.

217
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,151
What are you all doing?

218
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,237
Can you see her?

219
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,823
This is a surprise party
we prepared for her.

220
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,908
She can see again.

221
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:43,744
Please give my cousin

222
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:47,206
a lot of applause and love.

223
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:50,000
There's no hope for a ballet company
that lacks dignity.

224
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,086
I told you to stop.

225
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,717
Get ready for practice.

226
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,138
Director Ji.

227
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,557
When will Yeon-seo come?

228
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,767
If she doesn't come,
who will I dance with?

229
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:10,062
The official announcement for the casting
hasn't been announced yet.

230
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,647
Are you sure she's the lead?

231
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,024
We've never done Giselle before.

232
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,860
Until when should we do this
without the lead?

233
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,198
You lack skills but are greedy.

234
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,660
You lack the capability,
but only blame others.

235
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,704
People like that

236
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:29,957
are called hypocritical jerks.

237
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:31,959
Right?

238
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:35,463
Mind your own business.

239
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:36,630
I will bring her here.

240
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:39,884
We'll begin the practice.

241
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:54,815
Who told you

242
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:56,859
to change the practice song?

243
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,652
I was on my way to get you.

244
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,070
Excuse me, Associate Director Keum.

245
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,530
Let's go to the meeting room.

246
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,032
We're having an emergency board meeting.

247
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,995
How could you humiliate us like this?

248
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:11,248
Was this some sort of
noise marketing strategy?

249
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,751
Our ballet theater
doesn't need to stoop that low.

250
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,920
-I know.
-Is Lee Yeon-seo returning?

251
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,755
The problem is,

252
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:21,383
Director Ji has yet to persuade her.

253
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,303
-What? Persuade her?
-My gosh.

254
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:25,679
I'm at a loss for words.

255
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,139
What will you do now?

256
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,934
If you're going to use our money,
you better do things right!

257
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:33,812
What are you doing when you can't even
take responsibility for this?

258
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,314
Come up with a solution!

259
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:36,690
What's the plan?

260
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,609
-Tell me!
-What will you do?

261
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,112
I'll bring Lee Yeon-seo.

262
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,489
I'll bring her in front of you.

263
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:46,033
Actually, I will bring her
in front of this entire country.

264
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,327
The ballerina who lost her sight
in an accident

265
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,704
Lee Yeon-seo,
who's notorious for her temper,

266
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,999
will announce her return
at a press conference.

267
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:58,295
This will turn the tables,
and you'll be able to make money.

268
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,047
It will work.

269
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,301
What if

270
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,262
you fail?

271
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,805
I'll do whatever you want.

272
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,432
Whether it be children's Swan Lake
or something else.

273
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:11,642
-What?
-What?

274
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,644
-Children?
-Children?

275
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:14,937
What is he saying?

276
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:17,022
"A press conference"?

277
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,734
Director Ji.

278
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,570
Hand out a press release
about a press conference.

279
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,613
Say Lee Yeon-seo will come
and make a statement herself.

280
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,823
What if she refuses?

281
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:28,200
Let's not make things worse
and just choose Ni-na instead.

282
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:32,997
Lee Yeon-seo will come.

283
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,333
Also,

284
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,880
don't you dare meddle with my songs

285
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:42,965
ever again.

286
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,092
It won't work anyway.

287
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:49,263
That video of Yeon-seo has spread already.

288
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:50,723
It will work out.

289
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,892
The one who caused it is going to fix it.

290
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,655
I want a both of you in the photo.

291
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,741
Of you and Lee Yeon-seo.

292
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,453
You two must have the brightest smiles.

293
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:14,496
If it's possible,

294
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:18,208
I'd like your cheeks to be attached.

295
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,502
You're insane.

296
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:24,048
Why did you immediately say yes to him?

297
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:35,893
I can't do it. I'm scared.

298
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:36,894
Of what?

299
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,062
My goodness!

300
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,232
Hello.

301
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,276
Didn't you come here two days ago?

302
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,861
You're Yeon-seo's cousin.

303
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,906
You're her secretary.

304
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,074
Yes.

305
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,410
Sir, please help me.

306
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:56,121
-Sorry?
-The cat's being noisy.

307
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,753
What? No, no. Don't put me in the front.

308
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,714
I can't do this!

309
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,389
Don't cry in front of my house.

310
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,484
By the way, why did you run?

311
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,486
What about you?

312
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,739
-I was embarrassed.
-I was fired.

313
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:38,205
Oh, my.

314
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,541
Running made me

315
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,002
hungry.

316
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,348
Have some more.

317
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,017
Why aren't you eating any, Ni-na?

318
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,978
Can I call you that?

319
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,105
Sure.

320
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,940
Yeon-seo

321
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,028
must've been very upset because of me.

322
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,282
She wasn't that upset from the beginning,

323
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,950
but I made her furious.

324
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,535
I made her very enraged.

325
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,455
Is that why you got fired?

326
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,624
You seem like a good person.

327
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,087
I'm sorry. I can't be of much help to you.

328
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,884
What should I tell Director Ji?

329
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:39,516
What kind of man is Ji Kang-woo?

330
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:42,978
Why do you ask?

331
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,191
Ms. Lee might end up working with him.

332
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:48,484
I'm just curious.

333
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,741
I'm not sure.

334
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,326
It's strange.

335
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,036
I feel like I can say

336
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,371
hundreds of things about him.

337
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:02,915
But when I actually try to,

338
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,208
I can't seem to say anything.

339
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,919
I don't know if he's a good or bad person.

340
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,838
I don't even know if he's kind or mean.

341
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:10,923
But

342
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,842
I know one thing for sure.

343
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:17,846
He's really cool.

344
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,601
He's a really cool guy.

345
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,944
Gureum is getting discharged today.

346
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,570
Go and pick Gureum up in the morning.

347
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,405
The new security company will be here,

348
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,282
so make sure you register
your fingerprints.

349
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,372
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

350
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:44,832
What's this?

351
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,458
These are everyone's resignation letters.

352
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,213
What do you want?

353
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:54,716
Reinstate the managers that were fired
without a notice a few days ago.

354
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,468
That's our demand.

355
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:01,723
Ms. Lee.

356
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,434
If everyone quits this instant,

357
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,562
nothing will get done at Ivy Mansion.

358
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:07,646
Is that so?

359
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:11,150
Really? My gosh, I'm scared.

360
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,154
As you're all very competent,
I'm sure you'll have other offers.

361
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,157
I'll accept everyone's
resignation letters.

362
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,242
You don't need to transfer
duties to new employees.

363
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,368
Leave now.

364
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,246
Now.

365
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,457
Now!

366
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,512
I guess yours wasn't included here.

367
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,102
No one can match my salary other than you.

368
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,353
Is that all?

369
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:50,981
What choice do I have?

370
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,608
No matter how nasty and petty things are,

371
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,943
I'm supposed to just bury
my resignation letter deep in my heart.

372
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,403
That's how you survive in this society.

373
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:59,489
Employees who failed at their assignments.
Employees who harmed the employer.

374
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:00,616
I can fire all of them.

375
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,702
Sure. You are one fair employer.

376
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,329
Ms. Lee,

377
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:08,624
if you try to buy people
like you've been doing,

378
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:11,001
no one will stay by your side.

379
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:12,502
I have you.

380
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,131
My heart is already miles away.

381
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,426
Forget it. I don't need you.

382
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,432
Congratulations.

383
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,727
-Pardon?
-I read that you'll perform soon.

384
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,317
I read the news.

385
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,610
I'm so happy for you.

386
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:21,446
LEE YEON-SEO WILL HAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE
TO ANNOUNCE HER RETURN

387
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,518
I'M AT THE GRAND THEATER.
PLEASE MEET ME HERE

388
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:52,602
I'm in the lobby.

389
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:34,770
What do you think?

390
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,148
The guy doing a pas de deux
is your partner.

391
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:39,274
He's strong too.

392
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:41,109
And his dancing line is delicate too.

393
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:42,903
Cancel the press conference.

394
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:43,904
No, I don't want to.

395
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:44,946
Mr. Ji Kang-woo.

396
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:53,789
Yeon-seo.

397
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,542
Hello, my name is Kang Ui-geon.

398
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,336
Look for another partner.

399
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:01,505
I don't know what he told you,

400
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,173
but I'll never perform.

401
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:04,549
-What?
-She looks fine.

402
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:10,722
Press conference?

403
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:13,350
I'll walk there with my stick
and tell them

404
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,977
that you planned it and
released the articles without my consent.

405
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,441
Everyone will find out that you're

406
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:23,485
one lousy artistic director.

407
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,998
Let's do that if that's what you want.

408
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,584
As a matter of fact, they are dying

409
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,295
to have an interview
with a spoiled princess.

410
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,965
People who love to gossip will
have a field day out of you

411
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:47,008
and bring you down.

412
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:52,430
Why are you

413
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,016
-doing this to me?
-I'm trying to protect

414
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,518
you

415
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:58,520
and Fantasia as well.

416
00:23:58,603 --> 00:23:59,938
-I won't do it.
-You will do it.

417
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:02,482
-I told you I won't!
-You made it out.

418
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,443
You survived from the verge of death,

419
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,946
so I believe
that you will live a new life.

420
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:10,907
I remember how tightly you grabbed my hand

421
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:13,118
that day.

422
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:14,619
I see.

423
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:16,204
That was it.

424
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,505
Here's your reward for saving me.

425
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:28,049
Tell me if you need more.
I'll pay you more.

426
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:29,384
Take this and

427
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:32,554
don't use what happened that day
to boss me around.

428
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:44,274
Until when will you run away?

429
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:45,775
-Get out of my way.
-The reward?

430
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:47,694
That isn't nearly enough.

431
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:49,946
To me, your value is more than tens

432
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,990
and hundreds of million won.

433
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:54,701
Can you pay me that much?

434
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,369
I'll give up then.

435
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,705
Thank you for putting
such a high price on me.

436
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,457
But that's too bad.

437
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,959
The Lee Yeon-seo you remember is dead.

438
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:05,086
Look at me.

439
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,505
There is no ballerina who has three legs.

440
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:10,383
So wake up from your dream
and come to your senses.

441
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:21,102
Here it is.

442
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:22,771
FANTASIA BALLET THEATER

443
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,064
"Ballet Theater."

444
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:34,908
What's this?

445
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,953
One, two, three...

446
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:40,413
One million won?

447
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,520
Get in.

448
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,565
I can't let you go home alone.

449
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:10,485
They are already dating.

450
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,154
I...

451
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:16,491
It all worked out. It did.

452
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,660
I guess they are really
fated to be together.

453
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:22,372
I loathe noises.

454
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:25,750
Move your car.

455
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,056
Are you Ms. Lee Yeon-seo?

456
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,142
-Pardon?
-This is for you.

457
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:27,520
What...

458
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,492
AUNT

459
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,169
Did you get it?

460
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:55,090
-What's this?
-You didn't open it yet?

461
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:57,801
Take it out and sign the paper.

462
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:58,885
What is this?

463
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:01,096
Agreement on an extension
of the power of attorney.

464
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:03,640
The board of directors threw a fit today.

465
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:06,935
Having a temporary chairman and
a temporary general director

466
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:07,936
was unstable enough.

467
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,104
Now on top of that,

468
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:12,273
how will it look if the owner of the
foundation is rude and hated by everyone.

469
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:17,529
Everyone knows that you can't go anywhere
without your secretary.

470
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:20,073
The fact that you said you'll perform
is a huge lie, isn't it?

471
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:23,660
They all said they can't let you perform
or run the foundation,

472
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:25,787
so I used this card to let them calm down.

473
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,497
Sign the paper and send it over.

474
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,581
Who said you can do that?

475
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:29,499
Hey.

476
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:34,546
If I think about how rude you were to me,

477
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:39,175
I don't think I should be
taking your side right now.

478
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:42,011
But that's the scary thing
about blood relations.

479
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,934
I already consulted
with the attorneys too.

480
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:51,020
An extension of the power of attorney
due to a feeble mind and body.

481
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:53,481
If I am healthy, I won't have to
sign that paper, right?

482
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:54,899
I'm doing this

483
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:57,944
because no one knows if it'll take
a year or two.

484
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:01,364
Can you come out
to the press conference next week?

485
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:03,241
Do you want me to cancel it?

486
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:04,784
I'll do it.

487
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,661
I'll show you.

488
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:09,164
I'll show you that I'm perfectly fine

489
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:10,623
and normal.

490
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:13,209
If I can't, I will sign the paper
and have it notarized there too.

491
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,050
Princess.

492
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:23,344
There is no use in putting up a fight.

493
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:27,140
If your temper could fix you,

494
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,893
why would you still need your stick?

495
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,572
DOCUMENTS ON CORNEA DONATION

496
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:47,786
Listen to me.

497
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:50,955
Do not help me no matter what happens.

498
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,791
Wait right there.

499
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:58,922
I am the owner of my body.

500
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:00,006
I am fine.

501
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,884
My arms and legs are fine.

502
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,221
And my eyes.

503
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,371
Why can't I do this?

504
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,629
No one will stay by your side.

505
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,297
But I think that already happened.

506
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,341
Forget it. I don't need you.

507
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:45,093
Go have a great life.

508
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:47,345
You jerk.

509
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:51,182
Gosh, this looks so good.

510
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,856
Man, instant noodles are the best.

511
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,524
Man, it's so good.

512
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,944
Hey, are you okay?

513
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:04,737
Gosh, thank you.

514
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:06,489
Are you okay?

515
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:10,159
What's wrong?

516
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:11,494
Gosh, I almost got more sick.

517
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:14,914
Do you plan on taking on
every job you can?

518
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,292
I have to do this
because of the places that you go to.

519
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,335
Why don't you go somewhere nice?

520
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:21,170
Instant noodles aren't the only food
that exists.

521
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:23,840
You should give me some money, then.

522
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:27,343
Weren't you broke?

523
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,304
I found some money
like a blessing from above.

524
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:32,098
Oh, so you kept it for yourself?

525
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:33,975
Hu, we are angels.

526
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:36,060
Of course, I gave it to the police.

527
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:39,063
I wanted to borrow 30,000 won
from the detective,

528
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:40,565
but he just gave it to me.

529
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:41,900
He was a nice guy.

530
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,860
And you came here with that money?

531
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:49,240
I wanted to see

532
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,492
some humans.

533
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,203
-Here we go!
-Keep it going!

534
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,371
All right, great job.

535
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,206
-All right!
-Come here.

536
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,583
-Wait for me.
-Come here!

537
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,091
Yeon-seo probably has

538
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:10,470
never done something like that, right?

539
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,103
My gosh!

540
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:20,480
I'm not going to eat!

541
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:53,513
Ms. Lee. Have you had breakfast...

542
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:55,723
I'll do it.

543
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:56,891
I told you to move in.

544
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,102
How can I stay
in this huge house by myself?

545
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:01,229
You can tell Kim Dan to come.

546
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:03,231
I don't want to hear his name.

547
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:04,482
Come out for a second.

548
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:06,234
There's someone you should meet.

549
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,661
This is why I was late today.

550
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:21,290
Who is she?

551
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,089
Lavender?

552
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,257
I am Ki Bo-ra.

553
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,803
-Why?
-I sent her to the ballet company

554
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:35,596
after she was suddenly fired by you.

555
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:37,390
On your call?

556
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:39,308
A kind of reemployment.

557
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:42,061
A few days ago, she saw something.

558
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,287
I'm not sure if the former

559
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,956
security manager caused
the accident on purpose,

560
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,043
but I am sure he has been
working as their spy.

561
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,338
I doubt Dan was able to sleep
after being mistreated like that.

562
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:10,631
Then why?

563
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:12,633
Why did he--

564
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,093
I'm sure that I'm right.

565
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,596
Falling in love at first sight.

566
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,931
You'll tell him to come back, won't you?

567
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:19,974
No.

568
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,642
Why should I? I don't need him.

569
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:27,607
His address is the Catholic church.

570
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:31,527
Of course,
I know that you will not visit him.

571
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,201
Gureum, we have to go home.

572
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:40,703
The park?

573
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:45,750
Wait, no way.

574
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,044
Did he come here after he got kicked out?

575
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,254
Why would he come here?

576
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:11,067
Is it because this is where we first met?

577
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:20,660
Lee Yeon-seo.

578
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,630
What is this? Why are you here?

579
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:37,718
Twice your wage and 100-percent bonus.

580
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,137
What do you think?

581
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:41,764
You have nowhere to go. Come back.

582
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,474
You'll freeze to death if you sleep here.

583
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,355
If you die,

584
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:51,357
I know you'll haunt my dream as a ghost.

585
00:35:58,197 --> 00:36:00,283
I have to walk without a stick
by next week.

586
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:01,784
I have to walk no matter what happens.

587
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:02,743
So...

588
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,164
I need you.

589
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:08,124
Because of the press conference?

590
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:10,626
How did you know?

591
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,086
LEE YEON-SEO'S RETURN!

592
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,713
The news got around.

593
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:16,090
You were lying here knowing that?

594
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,342
Come on, I was going to be there.

595
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,386
I mean, you need me so desperately.

596
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,221
You're so annoying.

597
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:29,353
I don't need to be paid twice as much,
and I don't need the bonus.

598
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,440
But I have a condition.

599
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:44,410
What are you so happy about?

600
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,121
In a few days,

601
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,373
I'll no longer be
a temporary general director.

602
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,625
Aren't you happy?

603
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:51,876
It's just an extension.

604
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,336
Won't we still be temporary?

605
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,257
How many times do I need to repeat myself?

606
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:01,469
A human should be smarter

607
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,180
than an animal.

608
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:06,599
Ji Kang-woo has set the stage,

609
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:08,517
and I just need to take control.

610
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:12,188
She just regained her sight,
and now, she wants to do ballet again?

611
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:15,483
Whatever may happen,
she'll never be able to do that.

612
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:18,736
We will push ahead
with the press conference.

613
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:21,697
We will release a news article,
claiming that Yeon-seo will attend.

614
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,282
And when everyone's expecting her...

615
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:28,537
She will never show up.

616
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:29,872
And you'll use that chance

617
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:32,250
to take over the foundation?

618
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:34,961
You're 100-percent correct!

619
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:49,350
THIS IS JI KANG-WOO. PLEASE CALL ME

620
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:55,940
Again.

621
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:57,483
Excuse me.

622
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,653
I need to pick my kid up from daycare.

623
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,280
You can leave.

624
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:03,739
Thank you.

625
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,533
For good.

626
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,244
Let's practice the group dance again.

627
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,376
Music.

628
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:35,813
Are you protesting?

629
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,857
Why aren't you leaving?
You said you had to go.

630
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:38,774
It's okay, sir.

631
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:40,318
Your breath and balance

632
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,528
are unstable, and you're distracted.

633
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,405
Do you still think you're dancing?

634
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,198
-Su-ji.
-Yes?

635
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:47,992
You can do the press call instead.

636
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:52,705
Then I'll be the understudy.

637
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:55,291
Says who? I won't allow you!

638
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,543
Start from the beginning.

639
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,879
You better not slack off.

640
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:02,340
Focus on every single muscle in your body.

641
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:03,507
Get ready.

642
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:06,677
Music.

643
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,858
You're getting off work late.

644
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:22,443
You too.

645
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:23,778
Director Ji.

646
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:26,822
Have you eaten yet?

647
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:38,709
Jung-won returned

648
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,379
only six months after giving birth.

649
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,339
She cried every day,

650
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:45,925
trying to get her body back into shape.

651
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:47,426
So?

652
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,848
You should reprimand me instead.

653
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:56,769
It's all my fault anyway.

654
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:59,355
Had I not uploaded that video

655
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:00,940
and taken a photo with Yeon-seo,

656
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:05,444
the press conference
would not have been necessary.

657
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:09,407
Are you saying that I bullied
an innocent person

658
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:11,617
just because of Yeon-seo's
press conference?

659
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:13,536
Is that it?

660
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,000
Maybe it's because

661
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:23,504
she's only been a soloist,
but Jung-won isn't

662
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,464
in harmony with the others.

663
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,800
When Lee Yeon-seo returns,

664
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:30,845
I want to present her with a perfect team.

665
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:37,101
I won't need the photo

666
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:39,812
because Yeon-seo will show up.

667
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:41,480
Yes.

668
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:43,441
She will.

669
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,652
No matter how much she denies it,

670
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:48,362
she can never give up on ballet.

671
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:51,949
And how are you so certain?

672
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:55,119
Every time she scolded her team,

673
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,831
she'd say that our talents
were given from above.

674
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,959
She'd tell us to give it our all

675
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:03,878
so we wouldn't be an embarrassment

676
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:05,921
to those who couldn't be here.

677
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:10,759
That's something our ballet teacher
from when we were young always said.

678
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,056
She was taught well from the beginning.

679
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,518
Yeon-seo will return confidently.

680
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:21,437
And when that time comes,

681
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,189
I'll put up a good fight.

682
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:24,565
Then concentrate.

683
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,526
You have no time to focus on others.

684
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:31,739
You're right.

685
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:33,532
I don't know why

686
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,869
I keep getting distracted.

687
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,456
You're still a long way
from being selfish.

688
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:47,129
KEUM NI-NA, LEE YEON-SEO

689
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:49,381
But that's too bad.

690
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,759
The Lee Yeon-seo you remember is dead.

691
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:26,710
Hello, this is Ji Kang-woo.

692
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,550
Surprise.

693
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,638
What is that?

694
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:39,473
I'm going to teach you how to take steps.

695
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:40,558
You know how babies toddle?

696
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:41,976
One step, two steps.

697
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:43,769
Has this been proven to be effective?

698
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,188
-No.
-My gosh.

699
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:48,649
Still, let's try this.

700
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,109
You talked big to her,

701
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:52,695
so I'm not going to let you be humiliated.

702
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:05,958
Now.

703
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:08,961
Here. Grab here.

704
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:10,254
You can do it.

705
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:16,885
You're doing well. Great.

706
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:22,141
Good job. Now, just grab my pinky.

707
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:23,475
You can do it.

708
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:54,757
All right. Come to me.

709
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:13,317
Just look at me.

710
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:16,487
Just imagine

711
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,657
that it's only you and me in this world.

712
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:36,965
Oh, no.

713
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:40,427
He shouldn't fall for me.

714
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,058
All right, come on.

715
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,079
-Gosh.
-Darn it.

716
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:10,666
You didn't run over to me back there.

717
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:12,042
It's dangerous here.

718
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:15,963
Hey. You have a hole.

719
00:45:17,714 --> 00:45:20,050
-Mind your own business.
-Okay.

720
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:28,267
They're kissing!

721
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:30,394
Kiss!

722
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:31,895
Hey, we're...

723
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,189
Hey, do you know me?

724
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,983
Go to your mom.

725
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:42,322
Kiss?

726
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:43,699
Kiss?

727
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:44,908
Kiss...

728
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,622
No, it's not like that.

729
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:52,124
Get away from me.

730
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:54,960
Don't embarrass me by saying
what's on your mind.

731
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:57,337
I have a wish.

732
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:00,174
Already?

733
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:02,926
But I have a condition.

734
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:07,431
Grant me three wishes.

735
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:11,768
You should grant them
without saying a word.

736
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:15,022
What if you're asking for
my entire fortune or my life?

737
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:16,815
What do you take me for?

738
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:18,901
My wishes will benefit you.

739
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:23,071
Will you do it or not?

740
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,949
Yes. Here's my first wish.

741
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:30,704
If it's something weird, you're dead meat.

742
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:33,040
We're going to be late. Let's hurry.

743
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:34,917
-Where?
-To pray for my wish.

744
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:36,919
Your first wish

745
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:38,921
is to pray for it?

746
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,088
Yes.

747
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:45,385
DOPYEONG TEMPLE'S LANTERN FESTIVAL

748
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:48,096
I thought you believed in
some other deity.

749
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,182
You said something about
the deity up above

750
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:52,017
and how we're foolish
in his eyes or something.

751
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:57,189
"We are the world."
The deity loves everyone.

752
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:00,192
Let's go.

753
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:09,451
Making a wish is so useless.

754
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,995
Your life is the epitome
of lack of virtues.

755
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,206
You need to beg for blessings.

756
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:17,167
Why do you think
I went blind if that worked?

757
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:19,294
You have no faith.

758
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:20,879
Let's go.

759
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:23,340
Hello.

760
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:25,384
Hello. What brings you here?

761
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:27,261
We'll make a wish on the floating lantern.

762
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:28,345
What about you?

763
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:31,014
I came here to say hello to my friend.

764
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:32,808
My friend was put here15 years ago.

765
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:33,976
It's my friend's anniversary.

766
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:36,144
Last call for the floating lanterns.

767
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:37,938
We have two left.

768
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:40,440
Bye.

769
00:47:40,857 --> 00:47:42,484
-Bye.
-Do you want to join us?

770
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:46,321
This is a good thing.

771
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:48,907
Excuse me. These two will go in now.

772
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,410
Hey, you didn't even ask
Mr. Ji if he wanted to.

773
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:53,161
I'd love to.

774
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:29,489
You're not going to write one?

775
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:33,535
I don't know what to write.

776
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:36,163
I don't have any wishes.

777
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:38,957
In that case, write the most common wish.

778
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,836
Make a wish to be happy.

779
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:44,588
Did you write down

780
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:46,548
the same wish?

781
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:03,106
You'll help me?

782
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:05,734
Yes. Tell me whenever you need my help.

783
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:06,943
I'll do my best.

784
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:10,197
I'd be grateful if you can.
I promise to reward you.

785
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,032
No. I don't need you
to compensate for my help.

786
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:14,284
Just make sure Yeon-seo
gets her spot back.

787
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:17,996
When that happens, it will be only natural

788
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:20,040
for you two to spend time together.

789
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:21,875
A temple?

790
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:24,461
I prefer not to go there.

791
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:26,505
There's a lantern festival that day.

792
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:28,006
Come out to make a wish

793
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,424
before the important day.

794
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:32,344
-Gosh.
-You said you'd help me.

795
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:35,472
Yeon-seo isn't answering my calls
and ignoring my messages.

796
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:37,474
We have to fake a coincidence.

797
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,145
Floating the lanterns will begin shortly.

798
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:44,523
Everyone, please come to Tusita now.

799
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:47,317
-Let's hurry.
-Wait.

800
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:49,069
My shoes.

801
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,447
Hold on. I put them here.

802
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:54,241
Hold on a second.

803
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:00,455
What?

804
00:50:00,997 --> 00:50:03,458
They're gone. You wore those sneakers
every day during your practice.

805
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:08,880
I bet someone stole them.

806
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:10,966
Someone probably made a mistake.

807
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:13,260
Then, there should be
a pair of shoes left, but there isn't.

808
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,721
I'm sure someone took them on purpose.

809
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:18,098
What should I do?

810
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:21,268
Stolen or not,
that person probably didn't get that far.

811
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:23,061
I'll go get them. Wait here.

812
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:29,359
Let me inform you again.

813
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:32,446
Floating the lanterns
will begin in ten minutes.

814
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:34,156
Please hurry.

815
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:37,242
All right. Get on my back.

816
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:39,494
That's okay. I'm sure
Dan will find my shoes.

817
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,457
If we miss the time,
everything will be pointless.

818
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:46,376
Whatever it is, you must do it
at the right time.

819
00:50:47,043 --> 00:50:48,044
Come on.

820
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:17,574
Loosen up. It's harder on me
when your body is so tense.

821
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:19,618
I want to come down. Put me down.

822
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:21,369
Hang in there. We're almost there.

823
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:07,624
The press conference.

824
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:10,293
Tell me if you're not ready for it.

825
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:11,628
You don't have to do it.

826
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:14,214
And the show too.

827
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:17,634
I'll postpone the show
until you're okay with it.

828
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:20,178
I'm sorry about that day.

829
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:23,557
But I want you to understand
this one thing.

830
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:25,767
The life you're giving up on

831
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:26,977
could be

832
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:29,938
a dream that someone else

833
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:32,065
desperately wanted.

834
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:35,944
Is that someone else

835
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:38,905
the friend you came to see?

836
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:52,919
What's taking him so long?

837
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:09,728
-Where are you?
-Where are you?

838
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:10,937
Why aren't you coming?

839
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:14,858
I'm near the river.
And there's a big rock too.

840
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:16,318
I found your shoes.

841
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:18,403
I'll head over there,
so float your wish-lantern.

842
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:24,826
Shall we?

843
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:43,386
Just make this promise to me.

844
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:45,722
Anything. Tell me.

845
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:47,891
Promise me that whatever you do,

846
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:49,768
you will do it for her happiness.

847
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,603
Her happiness?

848
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:52,729
That's too abstract.

849
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:54,773
Promise me. Now.

850
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:19,464
Help her find her true love.

851
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:22,509
I ask that her true love

852
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,052
is someone

853
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:26,471
more angelic than a real angel.

854
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:56,042
PRESS CONFERENCE
FOR LEE YEON-SEO'S RETURN

855
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:02,173
What are you doing?

856
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:03,883
We were going to leave out
Lee Yeon-seo's name

857
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:05,677
and do a press call
for this year's performance.

858
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,012
I'm sorry.

859
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:09,556
I was informed that
she promised to be here.

860
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:11,558
The board of directors
was informed as such.

861
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:12,642
I was told to push ahead.

862
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,561
No, I'm sure it was just the Chairman.

863
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:15,937
Or it was the General Director.

864
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:17,272
That's correct.

865
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:20,275
I told her not to cancel it.

866
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:22,527
From what I remember,

867
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:24,404
you've been dying to work with Yeon-seo.

868
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:26,740
I don't see a problem here.

869
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:46,468
CHOI YEONG-JA

870
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:48,344
LEE YEON-SEO

871
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:58,730
LEE YEON-SEO

872
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:10,950
I'm sorry.

873
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:14,079
Unfortunately, Ms. Lee Yeon-seo

874
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:17,457
is suffering from a very
severe mental condition.

875
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:18,666
I heard that she just arrived.

876
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:19,959
-What?
-She's here?

877
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:26,674
-It's Lee Yeon-seo.
-Lee Yeon-seo is here.

878
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:27,675
It's really her.

879
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:48,863
I told you that I'll show you.

880
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:04,879
When did you get here?

881
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:16,641
Hello.

882
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:19,644
I am ballerina Lee Yeon-seo.

883
00:57:21,729 --> 00:57:23,731
A dancer is someone
who speaks with their body.

884
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:26,025
I do not think I need to say a lot.

885
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:28,027
I regained my sight,

886
00:57:28,486 --> 00:57:31,489
and nothing is wrong
with my body and mind.

887
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:33,366
I will show you more in detail

888
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:36,578
through my dance at my return performance.

889
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:48,631
-Congratulations.
-Yes, thank you.

890
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:50,550
-Have a safe trip back.
-Goodbye.

891
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:52,427
Goodbye.

892
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:58,516
You have always been fine, haven't you?

893
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:01,352
You did this to make
a fool of me, didn't you?

894
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:03,897
You are my legal representative as of now,
aren't you?

895
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:06,524
Why do you ask?

896
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:08,776
Let me retract that first.
Please retract that.

897
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:13,948
Can you organize the management state of
the foundation and give it to me, Ru-na?

898
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:17,202
You wouldn't know a thing
even if you saw it.

899
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:18,453
Then you can

900
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:20,246
make it look easy and accurate.

901
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:23,958
Are you saying

902
00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:26,377
that you want to claim Fantasia again?

903
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:28,922
"Again"? No. You're giving it back to me.

904
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:32,634
Fantasia is mine, to begin with.

905
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:35,553
Please take care of it in a hurry.

906
00:58:40,975 --> 00:58:41,976
Hey.

907
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:45,146
I got a call from Mr. Ji Kang-woo.

908
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:47,065
They're going to go ahead
with the press conference.

909
00:58:47,148 --> 00:58:49,067
Should I go and put
footstep stickers there?

910
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:50,902
Or you can just go with me--

911
00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:52,028
I have to go alone.

912
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:54,906
If I don't, they will do anything
to cavil at me.

913
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:57,325
Even so. It's not perfect yet.

914
00:58:57,408 --> 00:58:58,493
I can do it.

915
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:00,161
But give that to me.

916
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:02,830
The handkerchief.

917
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,375
The one that you wrapped
around my wrist before.

918
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:06,793
The one that you put a spell on.

919
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:08,628
I'll think of that as you.

920
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:21,057
Great job!

921
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:23,726
Great job, Yeon-seo. I'm so proud of you.

922
00:59:24,185 --> 00:59:25,019
Let's celebrate.

923
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:27,730
It doesn't contain alcohol, but I thought
we can still use it to celebrate.

924
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:38,491
Why? Are you feeling ill?

925
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:42,662
Was it all too straining?

926
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:44,414
Thanks, Dan.

927
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:48,668
It's all thanks to you.

928
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:53,047
Thank you. I mean it.

929
01:00:06,227 --> 01:00:07,437
You did this.

930
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:09,314
Great job.

931
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:11,149
You've done so well.

932
01:00:17,196 --> 01:00:18,072
Cheers?

933
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:29,208
We're at the outdoor stage. Come quickly.

934
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:34,672
Two.

935
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:36,966
Three.

936
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:42,055
You're doing so well now.

937
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:46,893
You really

938
01:00:47,935 --> 01:00:49,228
don't need me anymore.

939
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,524
You're right.

940
01:00:56,402 --> 01:00:57,528
So this is it.

941
01:00:58,279 --> 01:01:00,990
I run out of things to do
as you get better

942
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:04,243
and become happier.

943
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:10,416
Hey, Noisy Gong.

944
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,043
Walk around freely now.

945
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:15,046
Go dance and lose your temper too.

946
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:16,172
Is that your wish?

947
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:17,674
Of course not.

948
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:20,301
I only have two left. I have to save them.

949
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:24,222
I know what your wishes are.

950
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:27,266
How do you know?

951
01:01:27,725 --> 01:01:28,768
Close your eyes.

952
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:31,312
-Why?
-I will

953
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:33,106
grant your wish.

954
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:34,774
Come on, before I change my mind.

955
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:37,777
I think you are completely off.

956
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:39,237
There is no way you would know.

957
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:41,781
Okay.

958
01:02:00,007 --> 01:02:01,259
What are you doing--

959
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:06,764
I was going to reward you on your cheek...

960
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:09,726
Why did you turn your face?

961
01:02:47,388 --> 01:02:50,099
No, please. Please.

962
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:51,934
Please.

963
01:03:49,575 --> 01:03:51,160
Yeon-seo is just a client.

964
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:53,079
After I make Yeon-seo fall in love,

965
01:03:54,413 --> 01:03:55,998
I will go back up there no matter what.

966
01:03:58,459 --> 01:04:00,837
I guess he's one of those guys

967
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,755
who can act as if a kiss meant nothing.

968
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:04,799
Yeon-seo, pull yourself together.

969
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:07,510
Goodness.

970
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:10,638
Fantasia's Night will be held
in two weeks.

971
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:15,184
I thought you liked me.

972
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:17,019
Did you like me?
