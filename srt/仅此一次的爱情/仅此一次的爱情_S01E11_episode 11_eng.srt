1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,640


2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,990
 People say life is unpredictable. 

3
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:16,100
 Who would have thought? The naive country girl, Giselle, 

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:22,440
 would fall in love, be betrayed, and then... 

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,720
 go crazy. 

6
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,920
 Just like I didn't know I would meet you, 

7
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,230
 recognize you, and fall in love with you. 

8
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:06,100
 Just like... how we don't know what our ending will be. 

9
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:13,300
♫  I wanna be your light  ♫

10
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,630
♫  When I'm wandering in the dark  ♫

11
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:25,430
♫  I wanna be butterfly  ♫

12
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:33,720
♫  As I reach out my hand, I miss you  ♫

13
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,650
♫  Why is it not easy  ♫

14
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:44,220
Great job, really.

15
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,700
It took me a long time.

16
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:56,610
I was... lost in a dark and long tunnel for a long time.

17
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,640
It was so long without an end.

18
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,360
I thought I would never be able to get out.

19
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:11,880
I finally found... the exit. Finally.

20
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,050
♫  If I embrace you with all my might  ♫

21
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:24,900
Lee Yeon Seo, be my Giselle.

22
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,970
Giselle?

23
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,680
   

24
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:38,880
Goodness, you found me.

25
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:49,290
This is all you could think of doing on your day off? Rolling on a sandy beach to do such things?

26
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:53,000
I was going to stay quiet,

27
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,890
but the guard post was way too old.

28
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:57,900
Stop smiling. You're annoying me.

29
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:06,090
What was it like to see me in secret? I must have looked like a complete fool to be so easily deceived, to dance around.

30
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,040
It was really pretty.

31
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:15,760
It was really pretty. This part of my body felt itchy.

32
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,680
And I became sad and happy.

33
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,840
Don't be so cheeky. What do you know about dance?

34
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,060
Because I don't know anything, and because there was nothing I could do.

35
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,900
This was the least I could do for you. I wanted to do something for you.

36
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,700
But as you said, I don't know anything about ballet.

37
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,810
Then you should just sit still. Yes, you're useless.

38
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:43,330
You can't drive, you can't do judo. And you get on my nerves saying I'm too mean.

39
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:47,030
That's enough. Stop doing things behind my back.

40
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,280
Should we go now?

41
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,760
Let's go to Fantasia Night.

42
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:09,140
Let's show the sponsors who the prima ballerina is.

43
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:14,080
What should I prepare? A dress that is way too showy? My business smile?

44
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,530
Don't be sarcastic. You know that this is necessary.

45
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,830
Not all sponsors are perverted or dirty.

46
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,630
It's the dancer's job to receive attention and bear it. It's not your job to suffer (that harassment),

47
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,380
even though you can speak straight like that.

48
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,180
Over the ten years of my life as a director, I never made

49
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,840
my ballerinas suffer sexual harassment, not even once. Trust me.

50
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,410
No!

51
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:39,720
There's a saying, "We shouldn't even say a hint of the obscene, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed."

52
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,330
Hey, cult member. What are you talking about?

53
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,620
Don't go. Your dance is good enough already.

54
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,900
There's no reason to prove yourself any further or flatter others.

55
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,400
There's no need to bear the wickedness.

56
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,260
Mr. Ji, do you think this is why I—

57
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:54,810
Excuse me!

58
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:59,390
You're right. It could be dirty and uncomfortable. And it could be worse.

59
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,080
But still, we shouldn't avoid this, Yeon Seo.

60
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:07,020
I'll fight with you. I want to see you become the center of Fantasia.

61
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,170
I'll take care of it. Mind your own business. Both of you.

62
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,300
Is this what they call a dream?

63
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,220
Ah! That startled me!

64
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:57,410
How did you know about that beach? Even I couldn't remember, so how could you?

65
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:08,390
You're smiling brightly, aren't you? You look pretty.

66
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,920
Can you stop saying that? Are you teasing me?

67
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:15,260
He said that a useless servant should do what he can.

68
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:19,250
I may be useless, but I will call you pretty since you are.

69
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,650
Because I can do that.

70
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,260
I'm sorry.

71
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:34,620
You said you didn't like me. So why are you doing this?

72
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:48,170
   

73
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,730
Your registration has been completed.

74
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,460
Thank you.

75
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,890
- Are you Mr. Kim Dan? 
 - Yes.

76
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:29,300
Come over here. We'll start immediately.

77
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,410
Thank you, sir!

78
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:38,770
Brakes! How many times do I have to repeat myself?!

79
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:41,680
First, belt. Second, brakes. Third?

80
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,210
Third, start the engine!

81
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,190
Again.

82
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,840
Brakes. Start the engine.

83
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,730
We're pretty much crawling.

84
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:57,690
That's... That's my report! Wait! Come on!

85
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,950
Disqualified.

86
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,630
- Ah, Sunbae! 
- What is it?

87
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,840
Are you seriously keeping an eye on me?

88
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,910
What? Can't you see I even have to wear this kind of uniform as well

89
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:13,750
and suffer because of you? Why do I sound like this?

90
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,990
I'm trying so hard to help you.

91
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,760
Then, you should have told me earlier!

92
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,640
Thanks to you, I'm already disqualified when I just started.

93
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:30,320
There. Remember the steps and begin.

94
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,040
How could an angel threaten someone and cheat like that?

95
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,910
Begin.

96
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,900
- Fine. 
 - Are you ready? Begin.

97
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,260
- No! 
- Hey! Hey!

98
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,840
- Do it again. 
- Which one’s the accelerator?

99
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,060
- The right side!
 - Here I go.

100
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,400
- Good, good! Good! Stop! 
- Which one's the brake?

101
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,090
 - Disqualified  
- How does this work?

102
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,260
 Disqualified 

103
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,490
Why is it going this way?

104
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:57,910
 Disqualified 

105
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:02,630
- Stop! You did it!
  - Number 1, 210. Kim Dan, Qualified. 

106
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:06,980
No wonder you always cause trouble. You're not smart to begin with.

107
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:10,140
I'm never going to learn anything from you!

108
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,080
You little...

109
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,280
Hey, Kim Dan!

110
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,420
Kim Dan!

111
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:20,710
Wow, you've really become a human. You can be really enraged.

112
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:23,650
You were being too harsh on me. A beginner can make mistakes, you know.

113
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:26,170
I didn't know how to operate it. I didn't know what I was doing.

114
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:28,150
But you shouted and criticized me!

115
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:31,080
What you were doing wasn't right and I wanted you to snap out of it.

116
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,930
You always guided animals.

117
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:35,600
I was worried you wouldn't know which way to lead

118
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,350
- your human client and fail while being confused about the directions. 
- What do you mean?

119
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:43,050
I know this is your first time dealing with humans. It's the first time you're in a human body, too.

120
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:47,640
But isn't this a bit too much? Listen to this.

121
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:52,040
"Lee Yeon Seo danced. She was very beautiful."

122
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:56,460
"It was the prettiest thing I've seen on earth."

123
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:00,350
 She practiced too hard. I was afraid that.. 

124
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:03,690
 Yeon Seo would have a hard time and might become unhappy. 

125
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:08,200
 But Lee Yeon Seo's face shone brightly as she danced. 

126
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,020
 She was definitely happy. 

127
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,710
How much have you written about Lee Yeon Seo?

128
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:17,900
After twenty lines about her, in the end, you'd written, "She hugged the Rib."

129
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:22,650
That was just seven syllables long. Is this even a report worth seeing?

130
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,270
That's the truth!

131
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:29,040
Now that we're on this topic, I want to ask you... Do you think "the Rib" is a trustworthy person?

132
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,960
What are you saying?

133
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:34,520
This is their beginning. Her "Rib" has to be a dependable and trustworthy person

134
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,100
so that Lee Yeon Seo can be happy.

135
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:44,530
Can't you find out if he is?

136
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,470
   

137
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,750
 Are you scared? 

138
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,380
 No. 

139
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,450
 I'm going to stay with you. 

140
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,400
 It's dangerous. Stay there. 

141
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,410
 Listen, Raporas, an angel. 

142
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:28,210
 You had received a mission of inspiring artists 

143
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:32,650
 so they would be able to draw things that will give joy to God. 

144
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:36,170
 However, you betrayed your mission and even decided to abandon God. 

145
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:38,590
 Therefore, you'll be judged. 

146
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:41,420
 I've completed my duties as an angel. 

147
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:46,730
 From now on, I want to be a muse for 

148
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,670
 only one person. 

149
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:08,660
 Becoming an angel or a human, 

150
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:13,640
 starting one's life and ending it, 

151
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,120
 is all God's will. 

152
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,500
 Don't come closer. 

153
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:23,350
 Don't come, please. 

154
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,940
 He is cruel. 

155
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:34,630
 If you were going to punish me, then why did you give me a heart in the first place? 

156
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:39,340
 You gave me a heart and then told me to overcome my feelings. 

157
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,260
 This is the devil's doing! 

158
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:46,490
 Everything that has been given to you by God will be taken away.

♫   The lives we play behind the mask   ♫

160
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:47,380
♫   A constant breath of pain   ♫

161
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,670
 Please, please stay with me. 

162
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:52,850
 Please, please stay. 

163
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,950
 Please. 

164

♫  I can say anything that I want, and I have learned  ♫

165

♫  I believe in things that I see, I pray  ♫

166
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:22,590
♫  I don't know if I can anymore, so watch me pray  ♫

167
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:29,600

♫  There was a word of God  ♫

170
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,570
 I desperately wanted to become a human, 

171
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:09,430
 but not in a world where you don't exist. 

172
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:15,630
♫  I can say anything that I want, and I have learned  ♫

173

♫  There was a word of God  ♫

177
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,480
 I couldn't even die 

178
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,790
 or live a proper life... 

179
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,510
 for fifteen years. 

180
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,690
This time,

181
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,570
I think it'll work out.

182
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,660
You must have lost a loved one.

183
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,780
I can still see the waves of yearning in your eyes.

184
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:20,320
As you loved the person with all your heart, I'm sure your loved one will be in paradise.

185
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,100
She must be resting in peace.

186
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,200
Is "peace" really attainable?

187
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,880
Living is already suffering.

188
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,030
Wishing to be born again is funny.

189
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:38,530
Wishing for peace in the other world is also ridiculous.

190
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,350
Then...

191
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:46,610
What do you want to attain, Sir?

192
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,900
Will you really attend the event?

193
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:08,680
"If you leave your home, there will be trouble. Stay at home."

194
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,500
That's your horoscope for today. Doesn't it sound too eerie?

195
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,500
One of you recited some Bible scripture to me,

196
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,100
and you're reading my horoscope?

197
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,500
It's because we don't feel good about this.

198
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,500
Horoscopes are big data that contain the principles of the universe and human history.

199
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,700
If you ignore it, you'll be in trouble.

200
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:26,600
I'll face it. I probably can't avoid it even if I want to.

201
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,500
Fine.

202
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,700
Since you're attending it, go announce it with a bright smile.

203
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,700
"Fantasia belongs to me."

204
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,100
"This place is mine." Make it official.

205
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,700
I'll be out after I get changed.

206
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,800
Okay.

207
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,460
 Do you like me? 

208
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,100
 Just say yes or no. 

209
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,200
 Did you like me? 

210
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,500
 Do you? 

211
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,600
 No. 

212
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,300
 Hello. What would you like? 

213
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,100
 - Something to help me to be okay on my own. 
- Pardon? 

214
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:38,300
 Relaxing pills, sedatives, or stimulant drugs. I don't care what it is. 

215
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:43,100
 I've been relying on people too much. 

216
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,700
 I've been relying on a guy who doesn't even like me. 

217
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:50,000
 I'm not the type of person who gets easily attached. 

218
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,300
 I must have lost my mind for a second or something. 

219
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,900
 Give me some medicine that will make me be okay without that jerk. 

220
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,300
Darn it.

221
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,800
Hold on. Get out of the car.

222
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,300
I'll move the car for you.

223
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,100
Let me keep trying.

224
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,300
Okay, then.

225
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,800
Yes.

226
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,800
Behind you. Watch out for the gate.

227
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,500
Goodness, you're in my way. Get out of my way. I'm parking here.

228
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,000
Were you really parking?

229
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,900
I was keeping a safe distance, you know? When did you get your driver's license?

230
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,100
What are you talking about?

231
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,000
My gosh, your driver's license. You're not supposed to park your car here.

232
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,000
- Come on. 
- Goodness.

233
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,300
What is this? Did you get your driver's license?

234
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,300
Yes.

235
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:38,400
Why don't you ride with me today? For safety reasons.

236
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,990
That would be better.

237
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,700
Welcome, Yeon Seo. Welcome.

238
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:58,500
He's the special man of the hour today. This is Ishikawa Seiji-san.

239
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:02,300
Ms. Lee, it's very nice to meet you.

240
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,300
Thank you.

241
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,400
- Have a good time today. 
- Okay.

242
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,300
Why don't you escort Seiji-san, Yeon Seo?

243
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,300
Seiji-san, hello.

244
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:26,500
- I'm Fantasia's artistic director, Ji Kang Woo. Nice to meet you. 
- I see.

245
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,600
- Why don't we go in? 
- Sure.

246
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,900
You're wearing the earrings. How beautiful. They look great on you.

247
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:37,700
They don't suit my taste, but I'm being considerate for the gifter.

248
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:42,200
I'm very grateful. Your attendance at the event means a lot.

249
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,500
You will make the official announcement in front of the sponsors, right? When will you announce it?

250
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,700
I'll announce it as soon as the show ends.

251
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:53,500
Don't worry, Yeon Seo. Enjoy the event as much as you can.

252
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:15,100
I'll go check on the dancers. Wait for me here.

253
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,300
I'll go inside first. I can go in by myself.

254
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,200
- No, you can't. 
- No.

255
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,300
Let me escort you.

256
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:26,300
Do not leave Yeon Seo alone until I get there, okay?

257
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,500
Just hurry back.

258
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:43,100
Don't overprotect me. I can walk just fine without you now.

259
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,900
I know that. I didn't say anything.

260
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,300
Let's go.

261
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,700
 Check for anything... 

262
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:15,700
 that could fall around Miss first. Like lights or anything else. 

263
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,910
Ms. Lee.

264
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:37,200
 Do you really think that someone might be trying to harm Miss? 

265
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,100
 But she's their family. 

266
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,500
 Think about it. 

267
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:46,300
 The incident where the chandelier fell. She was in a car accident. And the light fell on her. 

268
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,900
 Scary things keep happening to her. 

269
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,900
 I'm just worried. 

270
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,600
Attention.

271
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,900
Don't get too excited. No injuries. Okay?

272
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,700
Yes, sir.

273
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,100
The floor might be slippery. Apply a lot of resin.

274
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:04,900
Yes, sir.

275
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:08,500
We'll get the sponsors to donate a lot of money.

276
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,500
We're not here to beg for money.

277
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,300
Don't smile to make good impressions. And don't overdo it by looking too serious.

278
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:18,300
Just show them that what we do is worth

279
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,100
every cent they spend. That's all.

280
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,900
Okay? Fighting.

281
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,500
It's an honor

282
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:09,400
to meet the legendary Lee Yeon Seo this up close.

283
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,700
Sure. Let us keep this good relationship.

284
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,100
What is this?

285
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:20,900
The world-renowned Ms. Lee is next to me, but I can't even hold her hand.

286
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,900
I'm so sorry.

287
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:30,100
Instead, choose a girl you like among them.

288
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:39,000
I will take her to you for a private meeting.

289
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:47,700
I like the one in the center. I especially like her thighs.

290
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,600
Ballerinas all tend to be way too skinny.

291
00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:00,500
Ms. Lee, it is such an honor to meet you.

292
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:06,700
Will you please show me a short performance?

293
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,700
That wasn't a part of our plan.

294
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:16,000
You should see that on a good stage.

295
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:21,100
We'll reserve a VIP seat for you on her comeback.

296
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,500
Please interpret that.

297
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:30,000
She just declined. She's being difficult.

298
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:38,100
If she is truly a genius, she can surprise everyone with an improvisation.

299
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,900
Not bad at putting up with those rogues.

300
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,900
Eat up, Yeon Seo.

301
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,400
Bring what I prepared.

302
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:12,400
 There won't be any CCTV cameras as it is a private party. 

303
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:23,900
 What's important is the people. Don't miss anyone who looks suspicious. 

304
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,500
Who are you? What are you doing here?

305
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,300
Oh, I was trying to smoke.

306
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:39,300
I'm sorry. I know smoking is prohibited here,

307
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,700
but my hands began to shake.

308
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,500
No, I'm sorry.

309
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,000
Goodbye.
