1
00:00:00,829 --> 00:00:07,919


2
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,850
- I didn't—
- See, I—

3
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,330
- That's not...
- I—

4
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,120
What are you...?

5
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,260
Sorry. I'm sorry, Yeon Seo.

6
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,750
Come here!

7
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,450
- Go to the side! 
- It's raining.

8
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:49,040
Why is this happening?

9
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,000
Thanks, Sunbae. I was about to get caught.

10
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,750
Wings!

11
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,610
Aigoo, my brother.

12
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:16,350
Please come to your senses.

13
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:21,240
That piece of trash. Pervert! Hypocrite!

14
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,930
It's late.

15
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,820
Where is Kim Dan?

16
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,270
Let's go.

17
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,570
     

18
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:23,780
I'm fine.

19
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,960
Getting caught in the summer rain can make you sick.

20
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,700
Whenever you get a cold, it always starts with body aches.

21
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,390
Me?

22
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,010
That's not true.

23
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:36,090
 You get a fever when you catch a cold. Come on, quickly. 

24
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,760
 It's stuffy, I don't like it. 

25
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,000
 Stay still. 

26
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,260
I was just saying that we can't let that happen.

27
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,230
From now on, you must not get hurt or sick.

28
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:56,740
You shouldn't be alone, either.

29
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:04,150
I will send over a Pilates instructor in the morning.

30
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:08,110
Check your body's condition, do some cardio, weight training, and stretching.

31
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,720
You'll start getting back in shape.

32
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,900
You're speaking even without breathing. Why are you so rushed?

33
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,870
You need to prepare yourself for war.

34
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:18,480
Starting tomorrow— No, starting now. It's war.

35
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,620
- I can handle it myself.
 - By standing about in the rain?

36
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,210
You're the one who dropped the bomb.

37
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:28,200
You declared your comeback with your own mouth at the press conference.

38
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,320
 A dancer speaks with her body. 

39
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,520
 I have opened my eyes, and my mind and body are sound and safe. 

40
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,190
 If you'd like more details, I'll let my dancing speak for itself on the stage. 

41
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:42,880
Is there really nothing the matter with your mind and body?

42
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,780
 Look at me only. 

43
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:51,820
 In this world, there are only the two of us. 

44
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:58,020
There isn't. I'm fine.

45
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:09,690
People would rather see others fail than succeed.

46
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:12,740
The people who were clapping for your recovery,

47
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:16,750
will be the first ones to point it out if you fail,

48
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,010
saying "You're standing on the edge of a cliff."

49
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:23,400
Whether I'm standing on a cliff or in hell, it's me who's standing there, not you.

50
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,210
The head director of your comeback performance is me.

51
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:29,320
If you fail, I will be humiliated along with you.

52
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,960
Two weeks.

53
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,950
I'll give you two weeks.

54
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:36,050
Build up your body and come to me for approval.

55
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:40,330
If you can't do it properly, Fantasia's prima will be Geum Ni Na.

56
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,190
One week.

57
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,050
One week will do.

58
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,850
Ni Na! Where are you?

59
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,730
Geum Ni Na.

60
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,070
Ni Na!

61
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,810
Why are you out here like this?

62
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,560
Unni...

63
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,870
 Director. 

64
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,100
 I have something to say. 

65
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,920
 Later. I have somewhere to be. 

66
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,450
 Are you going to Yeon Seo? 

67
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:18,700
 I don't have to report to you such a thing. 

68
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,460
 Don't go. 

69
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,670
 Ni Na. 

70
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:27,590
 You told me to be selfish. 

71
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:32,070
 I... will like you. 

72
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:35,910
 No. I already like you. 

73
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,770
 I'll pretend I didn't hear that. 

74
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,220
 Ever since that day, 

75
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:49,150
 that night when you touched my ankle, 

76
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,840
 it felt like a big stone fell right here. 

77
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:58,730
 Why today? 

78
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:03,170
 Your lifetime rival has recovered after three years. 

79
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:08,610
On a day like this, tha t you would be so preoccupied with your trivial romantic feelings and make a pointless confession 

80
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:11,510
 is truly disappointing. 

81
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,070
 Trivial? 

82
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,760
 Let's stop wasting time. 

83
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,030
 I'm not the Prince Charming that you think I am. 

84
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:21,910
 Then you can show me, can't you? That's what I  most want to know. 

85
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:25,530
 What kind of person are you? 

86
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,180
 A bad person. 

87
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:33,080
 Far worse than you could imagine or bear. 

88
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,170
I should never have told him. It was too fast.

89
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:44,470
I just thought that once Yeon Seo came back, I'd return to just being a shadow

90
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:48,520
and the director would look at me even less.

91
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,090
I wouldn't give a second glance, either.

92
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,640
Why would anyone look your way when you've already become a shadow in your mind?

93
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,390
Why are you acting this way? You're scaring me.

94
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,590
Don't you have any pride? Aren't you angry?!

95
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:03,120
Just now, you were utterly dismissed, both as a woman and as a ballerina.

96
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,040
I'm indignant as hell on your behalf,

97
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,390
but all you can do is sit there crying like a child?

98
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:12,870
Stop acting like a baby. No one's going to fix this for you.

99
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,950
Scram! I said leave!!

100
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:30,460
The state of emergency has come to an end! The rain stopped, too.

101
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,660
It's late. Head home quickly, before you're kicked out again.

102
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:43,430
I-I think I did something wrong!

103
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,580
Can an angel feel guilt?

104
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,190
Can I erase my sins?

105
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,480
Answer me. Who are you?

106
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,270
Kim Dan.

107
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:09,190
Not the name of your earthly body, but who you are, really.

108
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,720
I am the Angel Dan.

109
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,150
That's right. You must know what'll happen to an angel who

110
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:19,600
abandons their mission and commits sin, right?

111
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,060
- No, it's not that I committed a sin, it just feels like it! 
- "Feels..."

112
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:30,260
You must really not want to go to Heaven. Would you like to remain and just become dust?

113
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:33,970
Oh, wow! Threats? Are you an angel or a gangster?!

114
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,720
Senior!

115
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,480
I still have some time left.

116
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,150
An angel should only be obedient.

117
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:57,620
If you have other intentions, you're done for.

118
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:01,730
Just like how you can differentiate what's holy and what's worldly, a good man from an evil man,

119
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:05,510
remember who is before you.

120
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:08,280
You've led cats and dogs into paradise.

121
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,310
It's the same with that woman, got it?

122
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,300
♫  When the cold air  ♫

123
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,180
♫  Sweeps my cheeks  ♫

124
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:28,270
♫  I think of you who came to me gently   ♫

125
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:31,580
     

126
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:35,550
♫  Keep moving little by little  ♫

127
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:41,910
♫  My head is only filled with thoughts of you  ♫

128
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:47,210
♫  Now, I can  ♫

129
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:51,090
♫  I still don't know about it  ♫

130
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:54,920
♫  But every day even in the future  ♫

131
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:02,170
♫  It'll be filled with the nights that I think of you  ♫

132
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:07,050
♫  Stars falling this night  ♫

133
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:10,090
♫  when I'm thinking of you alone  ♫

134
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:14,810
♫  I know that  ♫

135
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:18,120
♫  you're sick of this  ♫

136
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,210
♫  On a night where cherry blossoms were scattering  ♫

137
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:25,890
♫  The night you draw alone  ♫

138
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:34,260
♫  underneath the moonlight's warm wind  ♫

139
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:41,590
Excuse me. One soju, please.

140
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:44,580
♫   But you know I f***ing love her now   ♫

141
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,940
♫   Like nobody ever could, and you know I   ♫

142
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,690
♫   stay trippin', am I crazy? Oh no   ♫

143
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:53,000
Thank you.

144
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,560
♫   Together or solo   ♫

145
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,110
♫   It doesn't matter where we are, oh no, no   ♫

146
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:01,000
♫   So if you hear about my lady, just know   ♫

147
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,180
What brings you here?

148
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:06,120
Then what about you? What brings you here at this hour?

149
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:11,920
Someone told me that there's nothing better than this when your heart's on fire.

150
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,040
All right, then.

151
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,250
♫   Cross me, cross me, if you, if you cross her   ♫

152
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,540
"Your heart is on fire"?

153
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:27,600
♫   And nobody's coming close, yeah, and I think that you should know that  ♫

154
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,980
♫   If you cross her   ♫

155
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,420
- If you're going to be this way, you should resign. 
- What?

156
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,570
I'll get you a better job. Someplace with better pay,

157
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:40,190
a place where you'll be free to do as you want.

158
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,160
What if I don't want that?

159
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,070
Not even can't, but "don't want"? Your reason?

160
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:48,040
If I get fired, it will be at Yeon Seo's hands.

161
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,630
This isn't your business to meddle with.

162
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,950
Didn't you say you would help me?

163
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,850
Have you forgotten what you must do, or

164
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,850
have you changed your mind?

165
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,100
I keep my promises.

166
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:06,210
I will get you together with Yeon Seo, with my own two hands.

167
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:08,240
"Young Lady"!

168
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:14,420
From the beginning, the way you keep calling her "Yeon Seo" is very offensive.

169
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:18,600
How could an employee who addresses their superior so informally be good at their job?

170
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,190
Why are you getting so mad?

171
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:27,990
I've seen her alone in the rain twice already.

172
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:34,100
You were concerned about Yeon Seo because she was alone...

173
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,040
so you got angry?

174
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,430
What I'm trying to say is that you're not doing your jo—

175
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,260
What are you doing?

176
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,180
You're feverish,

177
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:49,020
your pupils are shifty,

178
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,620
and you're nervous.

179
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:56,500
I was right!! You are mad!

180
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,120
It's great that you're worried for the Young Lady.

181
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,490
It's great, but I'll handle my job myself!

182
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:17,080
What the...!

183
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:22,190
She's a dog. She's a cat.

184
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:24,390
She's a pine tree. A blade of grass.

185
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:28,790
Lee Yeon Seo is merely a client. And after I make her fall in love,

186
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:31,290
I'll definitely return to Heaven.

187
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,770
I wasn't mad.

188
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:01,720
No. I actually was mad. I'm so mad!!

189
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:06,560
 You were concerned for Yeon Seo because she was alone... 

190
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,380
 and you're mad?! 

191
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,720
It's because of ballet.

192
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,250
I've barely managed to get her this far.

193
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,920
Now all I have to do is put her on the stage

194
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,320
in order to fulfill my promise to you.

195
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,130
Still, how could she with that secretary?

196
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:41,530
Why did you close the curtains?

197
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,490
So dark.

198
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,220
Miss!

199
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,440
What are you doing here?

200
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,600
Did you stay up all night?

201
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,930
Absence without notice and leaving a workplace can be a reason for dismissal, right?

202
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,520
Dan? Did something happen yesterday?

203
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:13,430
 I know what it is you want. I'll grant your wish. 

204
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:18,430
After listening to your theory about Dan, I senselessly—!

205
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,230
What did I do?

206
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,680
Ah, about Dan. And his unrequited love?

207
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,730
No! He said that wasn't it!!

208
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:31,780
Did you just ask him that to his face?! Of course, he'd deny it!

209
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,690
That's not it.

210
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:41,510
Please refrain from spreading and making groundless rumors starting now.

211
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:46,160
There's no way my instincts are wrong.

212
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,410
And fire this bastard. This time, for real.

213
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,620
 Good morning! 

214
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,230
Did you sleep well?

215
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:02,510
Butler, tell him that staying out all night is grounds for dismissal.

216
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:08,460
Please let her know I had an emergency and that I'm sorry.

217
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:12,400
I'm sorry, Miss.

218
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,240
What's up with you? Why are you suddenly speaking formally?

219
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,250
I've been too impetuous.

220
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,680
From now on, I'll behave myself.

221
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:26,510
Glad to hear it. I'm going to the practice room.

222
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,670
I have something to tell you.

223
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,430
Go ahead.

224
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,690
Yesterday...

225
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,330
Yesterday, I...

226
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,700
I behaved badly. Please forget it.

227
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,470
What are you saying? Nothing happened yesterday.

228
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:29,630
Between you and me, nothing happened. That's right.

229
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,280
It did.

230
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,360
It did not.

231
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,860
It did!

232
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,830
What the hell are you trying to do, you bastard?!

233
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:40,530
You told me to forget, so I was pretending it hadn't happened!

234
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,610
Don't you have any tact? Can't you get it right for once?!

235
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:46,940
- I can't act as if nothing happened when something did. Pretending it never ha— 
 - Stop!

236
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:51,170
That's exactly what I was going to say. I wanted to be the one to say it first!

237
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:55,830
Right now, if I'm to train and recondition myself, I can't have any distractions.

238
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:59,310
Good. Let's act like yesterday never happened,

239
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:04,500
as if we're meeting for the first time today. Let's do that. Okay?

240
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:11,640
What a relief that we're thinking the same thing.

241
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,900
Then it's settled.

242
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,810
If you need anything, just let me know.

243
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:26,020
Miss, fighting!

244
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:29,650
♫   One, two,  a one two three four   ♫

245
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:37,380
"Fighting"? "What a relief that we're thinking the same thing"?

246
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,430
The way he's able to just brush off a kiss like that means

247
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:45,650
he's the sort who takes things lightly? Is a kiss just an everyday, common thing for him?

248
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:48,580
Whatever. I don't need it either.

249
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:54,660
♫  Yeah, I would drown all day if you'd stay with me  ♫

250
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:59,200
♫  Oh, wouldn't it better  ♫

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:05,100
  
♫ If we could decide to stick together  ♫

252
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:11,910
   
♫  Give me something sweeter, oh~  ♫ 

253
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:15,640
♫  Something to show, show that you love me  ♫

254
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:21,690
♫  I want something sweeter  ♫

255
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:25,460
Oh, let's focus on my mission. Think about my job. There's a  mission I must complete.

256
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:28,510
I cannot delay your love and my return any longer now!

257
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:11,040
♫  It's all right, it's all right  ♫

258

262
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:39,470
 I know how you really are. 

263
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:41,860
 That you can shine so bright. 

264
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:45,810
 If you got those eyes from such a person, then don't waste them! 

265
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,900
♫  is you  ♫

  four. 

270
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:16,520

♫  It's all right  ♫

273
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,530
Are you okay, Miss? Are you hurt? You didn't sprain it, did you?

274
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:49,520
Hands off.

275
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:55,450
- Excuse me? 
 - I told you to get your hands off me, you perverted, crazy, cult, freak jerk!

276
00:22:55,450 --> 00:23:01,550
If you ever put your hands on me again, you'll be fired on the spot. Understood?

277
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,420
Yes, I understand.

278
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,530
I'll be careful.

279
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:14,350
If you understand, then get out. Don't come in unless I call for you.

280
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:39,040
Yes, Ni Na?

281
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:46,500
Ah, Yeon Seo? I am with her, but...

282
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,890
What is it? Why are you talking to my secretary?

283
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:58,720
Yeon Seo? I didn't know your number so I called Dan.

284
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,410
 Can you come out briefly? 

285
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,560
I don't want to.

286
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,090
I really want to see you, but I guess you don't want to see me.

287
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:10,750
That's right, I don't. And I plan to stay that way. So don't bother calling my secretary anymore.

288
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:16,200
H-How could you just hang up like that?!

289
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,900
How do you two know each other? You're close?

290
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,950
We just happened to meet a couple of times.

291
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:24,250
Really. Here, there, this woman, that woman...

292
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:28,080
If you meet her a couple more times, maybe another something will happen that you have to "forget."

293
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:30,790
Gureum, let's go for a walk!

294
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:46,130
Yeon Seo! You're better now!

295
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:48,890
Why are you standing outside someone else's home without saying anything?

296
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:54,880
Take this. It's a gift to celebrate and wish you luck on your rehabilitation.

297
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,460
Would you mind holding this, Dan?

298
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,450
Oh, sure.

299
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:04,700
Actually, this is my way of asking you for a match.

300
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,180
I've gotten a lot better over the last three years.

301
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:10,820
And I want to officially compete against you now.

302
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:15,530
Why is everyone being so ove- the-top, making it out to be a war or a match?

303
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:20,910
You have to make sure you get yourself back to how you were before. That way I can get people to properly acknowledge my skills.

304
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:26,130
Be prepared, Yeon Seo. I'm going to try really hard, too.

305
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,340
She's a kind person.

306
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,560
And me?

307
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,800
Shall I leave this in your room?

308
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,070
Throw it out.

309
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:53,240
After the press conference, a total of 14 articles became top news for daily papers and offline newspapers.

310
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:57,210
Over 200 related articles were published online in a day.

311
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:01,070
Negative comments because of the SNS incident

312
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:06,060
turned into support and encouragement. Over 80% of them were positive comments.

313
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,370
We should keep this going while it's going well.

314
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:17,690
Ishikawa Seiji of Japan called us in secret.

315
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:19,570
The man who's worth over billions of dollars?

316
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:22,120
The biggest sponsor of the Bolshoi Ballet.

317
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:27,360
He's a second generation Korean-Japanese, so he became interested in Korean ballet.

318
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:33,060
This is an opportunity to make Fantasia an internationally recognized company.

319
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:37,150
So, when will it be?

320
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:41,820
- Excuse me? 
- You and Chairman Geum Gi Cheon,

321
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:44,200
when will you step down?

322
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,390
That, um, uh, what do you mean?

323
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:50,390
There's a rumor going around that Lee Yeon Seo demanded to have Fantasia back.

324
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:55,280
It doesn't seem quite right that we discuss this important matter with people who will resign soon, does it?

325
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:00,190
After all, a change in artistic director can result in the complete change of a project we've been working on for a year.

326
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:04,060
There are still procedures that must be follo—

327
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,920
I'd be happy to just leave it all behind by tomorrow,

328
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,570
but it can't be.

329
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:13,740
No, I can't do it.

330
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:18,990
You all know the passion and love

331
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:25,750
I've poured into Fantasia these past three years. I'm sure you all also know it was all for the love of my niece.

332
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:31,650
I wanted to leave her a stable, successful ballet company for when she was healthy and ready to return.

333
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,910
But Yeon Seo, right now, is not sound of mind or body.

334
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:40,160
They say dancers know their own bodies best.

335
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:45,060
Do you think she announced her return without thinking about such things?

336
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:49,750
Do you have to see it with your own eyes to believe me?

337
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:57,600
I will pull up the date of the Fantasia Live performance.

338
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,100
You can see for yourselves there.

339
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,240
Of course,

340
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:07,030
the person who will be praying the most for our Yeon Seo to proudly be on stage in full health

341
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:11,310
- is myself. 
-  "Fantasia's Live Show?" 

342
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:13,960
It's our year-end sponsorship event.

343
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:18,220
We break up in teams, put on performances, hold a party and greet people, too. You know, don't you?

344
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:22,600
Of course. But don't you usually schedule it sometime after the big showcase is over and done with?

345
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:27,290
Because you and Yeon Seo have turned this ballet company on its head,

346
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,360
everything is a little chaotic.

347
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,660
So the two of you are required to attend in a nice outfit.

348
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:36,730
- Yeon Seo, too?
 - Of course. She is the owner of this place. She must greet her guests.

349
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:40,490
There are going to be some very important guests from Japan there.

350
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:43,920
You're familiar with the Ishikawa Seiji-san, I presume?

351
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:48,940
Of course. He's a big sponsor in the ballet world and notorious for his dirty hands (sexual harassment).

352
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:51,210
All art takes money.

353
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:55,270
And to put it frankly, if you catch the old man's eye, Seiji-san

354
00:28:55,270 --> 00:29:00,910
is famous for lavishing money without reserve on his favored projects, with those "dirty" hands of his.

355
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:07,340
I refuse to make our ballerinas please sponsors like flowers (like sexual servants).

356
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:11,370
I won't let my ballerinas do such things.

357
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:17,730
Only at times like this are they "his ballerinas,"

358
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:20,330
even though he's only interested in Yeon Seo.

359
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:25,350
She's the star of the show, after all. A heroine of our very own.

360
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:32,000
Turn out!

361
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:42,050
Straighten that knee.

362
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:45,430
Out to here.

363
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,420
More, more. More!

364
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,180
Tuck your chest in.

365
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,400
What's the repertoire for the Fantasia Night?

366
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,830
Are we preparing already?

367
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:19,170
The schedule has been pulled up. There's nothing special about it, so just continue practicing what you were doing.

368
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,820
Is something the matter?

369
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:44,430
I thought it went really well this time, right?

370
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,160
- Ni Na. 
- Yes, Director.

371
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,750
Can you take charge for the rest of the practice?

372
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:16,350


373
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:32,500
Rib. It's her first practice today. Why are you so quiet?
   

374
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,390
He was so angry last time as if he would devour me.

375
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:41,110
He'll manage it, won't he?

376
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,890
Gosh, that scared me.
