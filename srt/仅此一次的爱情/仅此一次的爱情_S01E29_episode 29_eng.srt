1
00:00:02,643 --> 00:00:05,183
You like being fair, right?

2
00:00:06,283 --> 00:00:10,963
If you take one, you give one.

3
00:00:12,403 --> 00:00:13,323
Right?

4
00:00:13,323 --> 00:00:17,853


5
00:00:17,853 --> 00:00:23,983
♫   The lives we play behind the mask ♫ 

6
00:00:23,983 --> 00:00:25,083
♫   A constant  ♫ 

7
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:27,203
For the sake of the person I want to save...

8
00:00:27,203 --> 00:00:28,583
♫   of pain ♫ 

9
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:30,653
...if I have to kill someone,

10
00:00:30,653 --> 00:00:32,623
♫   I can say anything that I want ♫ 

11
00:00:32,623 --> 00:00:34,213
...I will gladly...

12
00:00:34,213 --> 00:00:35,933
♫   When I want ♫ 

13
00:00:35,933 --> 00:00:37,513
...commit that sin.

14
00:00:37,513 --> 00:00:40,063
♫   I believe in things that I see ♫ 

15
00:00:40,063 --> 00:00:43,423
Take it all. Whatever it is.

16
00:00:43,423 --> 00:00:46,293
♫   I don't know if I can anymore ♫ 

17
00:00:46,293 --> 00:00:49,103
I can gladly give it.

18
00:00:49,103 --> 00:00:50,433
♫   I can see everything ♫ 

19
00:00:50,433 --> 00:00:54,353
      
 ♫   torn away from me ♫ 

20
00:00:54,353 --> 00:00:57,783
 Do you think Kim Dan wants to be a human in a world where you don't exist? 

21
00:00:57,783 --> 00:01:00,133
 That's not a prize, it's a punishment! 

22
00:01:00,133 --> 00:01:01,923
 Live. 

23
00:01:01,923 --> 00:01:05,303
 Live, and stay by Yeon Seo's side. 

24
00:01:10,563 --> 00:01:13,123
♫   That was a while ago ♫ 

25
00:01:15,353 --> 00:01:17,363
     

26
00:01:18,663 --> 00:01:20,663
 The phone is switched off. 

27
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:23,723
 Please leave your message after the beep. 

28
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:28,913
     
Are you really worried after breaking such big news?

29
00:01:30,433 --> 00:01:33,573
     
You need to stop barging into my house.

30
00:01:33,573 --> 00:01:36,623
Where are those two and what are they doing?

31
00:01:36,623 --> 00:01:41,393
Did you... meet Lee Yeon Seo?

32
00:01:44,843 --> 00:01:49,143
Starting now, listen carefully to what I'm going to say.

33
00:02:04,323 --> 00:02:07,883
 Her fate was to be killed by evil. 

34
00:02:07,883 --> 00:02:13,203
Are you really... going to kill me?

35
00:02:13,203 --> 00:02:15,663
 No. I cannot 

36
00:02:15,663 --> 00:02:18,003
 accept that is her fate. 

37
00:02:19,283 --> 00:02:20,863
 I'll change her fate. 

38
00:02:20,863 --> 00:02:24,483
Why? Just why?

39
00:02:59,473 --> 00:03:02,363
I told you to stay away from evil!

40
00:03:42,053 --> 00:03:45,363
You must not interfere in the lives of humans.

41
00:03:45,363 --> 00:03:48,143
Furthermore, if you've killed a human being, you'll never be forgiven.

42
00:03:48,143 --> 00:03:49,313
You'll dissipate immediately!

43
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:51,883
In order to save Yeon Seo, I need to get rid of the people who are trying to kill her.

44
00:03:51,883 --> 00:03:54,413
That's the only way to change that bullshit fate of hers!

45
00:03:54,413 --> 00:03:56,583
Kim Dan!

46
00:04:13,723 --> 00:04:17,033
Even if I don't do it, I'll dissipate.

47
00:04:17,033 --> 00:04:21,813
If that's the case, I'm going to save her and dissipate.

48
00:05:25,623 --> 00:05:27,643
Senior.

49
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:35,113
You told me not to do it. You said to not touch humans—

50
00:05:53,513 --> 00:05:55,643
I told you before.

51
00:05:55,643 --> 00:05:58,133
You have changed me.

52
00:06:00,873 --> 00:06:02,623
Senior.

53
00:06:04,373 --> 00:06:11,353
I've lived such a long life that I can't even remember.

54
00:06:11,353 --> 00:06:17,913
I've met numerous humans and many angels as well.

55
00:06:18,693 --> 00:06:23,743
I was always a bystander and a spectator.

56
00:06:24,463 --> 00:06:27,993
I barely felt any emotion.

57
00:06:30,453 --> 00:06:36,123
But you... completely changed me.

58
00:06:36,123 --> 00:06:39,893
Whenever I looked at you, I got angry,

59
00:06:39,893 --> 00:06:45,073
anxious, and frustrated.

60
00:06:45,073 --> 00:06:46,843
Sunbae...

61
00:06:53,343 --> 00:06:54,663
D-Don't do this.

62
00:06:54,663 --> 00:06:58,083
Don't do this! You can't do this!

63
00:06:59,263 --> 00:07:03,363
But Dan, I liked you.

64
00:07:04,473 --> 00:07:08,383
You're a lifesaver.

65
00:07:08,383 --> 00:07:12,283
Even if you had to cause trouble, you saved the animals

66
00:07:12,283 --> 00:07:15,463
and protected those who were weak.

67
00:07:15,463 --> 00:07:18,633
You were always pure

68
00:07:19,373 --> 00:07:22,603
and cheerful.

69
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:28,093
I wanted to return to Heaven with you.

70
00:07:31,093 --> 00:07:32,953
Senior...

71
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:36,693
No. No, Senior!

72
00:07:36,693 --> 00:07:41,873
Dan, live like yourself till the end.

73
00:07:41,873 --> 00:07:45,223
Go and save Lee Yeon Seo.

74
00:07:45,223 --> 00:07:47,633
S-Senior. Senior!

75
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,903
Senior!

76
00:08:23,923 --> 00:08:25,943
Yeon Seo!

77
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:34,563
- Let go. 
- No.

78
00:08:34,563 --> 00:08:36,693
Let go!

79
00:08:40,173 --> 00:08:42,683
Yeon Seo,

80
00:08:42,683 --> 00:08:48,713
I didn't get married so you could do this.

81
00:08:48,713 --> 00:08:54,273
Did you make me promise you at the columbarium and then practiced with Ni Na alone

82
00:08:54,273 --> 00:08:57,503
because you were preparing yourself?

83
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:59,473
As long as I can save you, I can do anything.

84
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:01,163
If you're not there, how am I supposed to live?

85
00:09:01,163 --> 00:09:03,793
Then how can I just stay still!

86
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:08,623
Even though I can save you, and you won't disappear?

87
00:09:12,193 --> 00:09:17,233
Even so, if you die, what about after that?

88
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,393
Kim Dan...

89
00:09:24,183 --> 00:09:26,383
If even you do this,

90
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,253
how am I going to live?

91
00:09:36,053 --> 00:09:37,923
Dan!

92
00:09:43,293 --> 00:09:45,293
I'm here.

93
00:09:46,633 --> 00:09:49,923
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

94
00:09:51,313 --> 00:09:53,343
Don't die.

95
00:09:57,213 --> 00:10:00,533
Because of me, you shouldn't...

96
00:10:03,513 --> 00:10:05,833
Don't die because of me.

97
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,123
Dan.

98
00:10:26,783 --> 00:10:28,483
Dan?

99
00:10:30,193 --> 00:10:32,913
Dan. Dan.

100
00:10:34,023 --> 00:10:35,373
Dan, please.

101
00:10:35,373 --> 00:10:37,003
Dan, please, please.

102
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,423
Please, please...

103
00:10:38,423 --> 00:10:40,933
Please don't do this. Please. Please don't do this.

104
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:43,173
Dan. Dan, get up.

105
00:10:43,173 --> 00:10:44,823
Dan. No, no.

106
00:10:44,823 --> 00:10:46,113
Dan, please.

107
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:49,883
Dan. Dan, please wake up!

108
00:10:51,713 --> 00:10:53,233
Dan, no. No.

109
00:10:53,233 --> 00:10:55,683
Dan, please!

110
00:10:55,683 --> 00:10:59,033
Seriously, don't do this! Don't do this, don't do this!

111
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,083
Dan! No, no!

112
00:11:02,263 --> 00:11:04,713
Dan!

113
00:11:05,853 --> 00:11:08,133
Dan...

114
00:11:21,173 --> 00:11:26,513
What happened? Where did you go to?

115
00:11:27,303 --> 00:11:30,213
Who did this to you?

116
00:11:40,963 --> 00:11:44,823
 Patient Number 151, please come to the counter. 

117
00:11:44,823 --> 00:11:49,043
 Thank you. 

118
00:11:55,523 --> 00:11:57,303
Ms. Yeon Seo.

119
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:04,053
How did you know to come here?

120
00:12:04,053 --> 00:12:10,353
No, what happened to Dan?

121
00:12:10,353 --> 00:12:13,083
Tell me everything you know. Don't leave anything out.

122
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:17,643
I think he was trying to get rid of Geum Roo Na.

123
00:12:19,643 --> 00:12:23,973
Because of me? Because she might harm me again?

124
00:12:24,853 --> 00:12:29,183
What are you two doing? Is dying and living a joke to you?

125
00:12:29,183 --> 00:12:30,913
I went to the church.

126
00:12:30,913 --> 00:12:35,543
I heard someone was taken to the hospital. The floor was covered with blood and pills.

127
00:12:35,543 --> 00:12:40,343
I was scared to death in case something happened to you.

128
00:12:42,443 --> 00:12:47,173
Unfortunately, I'm very healthy.

129
00:12:47,173 --> 00:12:48,913
I'm getting up.

130
00:12:48,913 --> 00:12:50,263
You're both fools.

131
00:12:50,263 --> 00:12:54,273
You're awfully stupid and selfish.

132
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,023
Don't you dare judge us.

133
00:12:56,023 --> 00:13:00,003
Do you know... how hard it was for us to make this decision?

134
00:13:00,003 --> 00:13:03,883
You're running away because you don't want to be left behind alone.

135
00:13:04,763 --> 00:13:06,723
That's not an honorable act.

136
00:13:06,723 --> 00:13:08,733
Don't fool yourself.

137
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,783
Why are things so complicated?

138
00:13:12,783 --> 00:13:15,813
Honorable act? I don't need that.

139
00:13:15,813 --> 00:13:18,673
Running away, you say? What of it?

140
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:23,533
If I can save him, I don't care if I become a coward or I am shameful.

141
00:13:26,043 --> 00:13:30,063
I won't play Giselle. Put on the show without me.

142
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,263
We only have two days left until the show.

143
00:13:33,263 --> 00:13:36,743
Tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, and the day after that.

144
00:13:38,863 --> 00:13:41,733
That's how much time Dan has left.

145
00:13:42,513 --> 00:13:47,843
He only has three days left. I can't perform on stage.

146
00:13:47,843 --> 00:13:53,073
I won't do it. I won't stay away from Dan even for a second.

147
00:13:53,073 --> 00:13:54,993
Do what needs to be done.

148
00:14:03,233 --> 00:14:09,543
   

149
00:14:09,543 --> 00:14:11,603
Dan!

150
00:14:11,603 --> 00:14:15,833
When did you wake up? You got hurt.  Are you okay? You're not in pain?

151
00:14:36,163 --> 00:14:38,833
Why won't you perform?

152
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:41,893
I don't need it. It's a waste of time.

153
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:52,353
- Do it.
 - I don't want to.

154
00:14:52,353 --> 00:14:54,453
- I said do it. 
- I said I don't want to!

155
00:14:54,453 --> 00:14:57,383
I came this far so you could dance

156
00:14:58,423 --> 00:15:05,383
and live your life. If you give up now, what have I done all this time?

157
00:15:05,383 --> 00:15:07,613
You want me to live?

158
00:15:08,393 --> 00:15:13,783
Is that why you were going to kill Roo Na Unni and got injured?

159
00:15:13,783 --> 00:15:21,523
You tried killing someone to save me, and you were ready to be dissipated immediately.

160
00:15:21,523 --> 00:15:22,383
Lee Yeon Seo.

161
00:15:22,383 --> 00:15:24,333
You're terrible.

162
00:15:25,123 --> 00:15:27,233
You thought I'd be moved by that?

163
00:15:27,233 --> 00:15:29,183
I'm not the least bit thankful!

164
00:15:29,183 --> 00:15:34,123
No. If you had disappeared at that time, I would have lived my whole life hating you.

165
00:15:34,123 --> 00:15:39,943
I would've have hated you for disappearing and throwing away the time we had, even if it was a day or two.

166
00:15:39,943 --> 00:15:46,533
Then what about you? You also tried to kill yourself. Who says? Who says you can take your own life?

167
00:15:46,533 --> 00:15:49,913
If I became a human that way, do you think I'd be thankful to you?

168
00:15:49,913 --> 00:15:52,373
All this happened because of me.

169
00:15:52,373 --> 00:15:55,543
You ended up like this because you tried to save me.

170
00:15:55,543 --> 00:16:01,353
Because I wanted to live. Because I wanted to live, you have to dissipate.

171
00:16:01,353 --> 00:16:03,103
It's because of me.

172
00:16:03,103 --> 00:16:07,503
This is why I have to save you.

173
00:16:07,503 --> 00:16:09,953
No.

174
00:16:09,953 --> 00:16:13,993
I thought it had to be you.

175
00:16:13,993 --> 00:16:19,123
If only one of us could live, I thought it had to be you.

176
00:16:19,123 --> 00:16:23,613
I thought it had to be you. You've never had a life.

177
00:16:23,613 --> 00:16:25,523
You didn't get to grow up...

178
00:16:25,523 --> 00:16:26,883
♫  ...become the scent  ♫

179
00:16:26,883 --> 00:16:31,983
living a happy and healthy life.

180
00:16:31,983 --> 00:16:36,223
Dan, it has to be you.

181
00:16:36,223 --> 00:16:38,593
I really want you to have that life.

182
00:16:38,593 --> 00:16:41,623
♫  ...my heart that wavered remembers  ♫

183
00:16:41,623 --> 00:16:44,153
Do you have any idea how scared I was?

184
00:16:44,153 --> 00:16:49,363
I thought that you were going to die in my arms. I was scared to death.

185
00:16:49,363 --> 00:16:53,793
Don't die. Don't go.

186
00:16:53,793 --> 00:16:56,703
Don't disappear.

187
00:16:56,703 --> 00:16:59,763
How can I live happily?

188
00:16:59,763 --> 00:17:02,193
How could I live a cheerful life?

189
00:17:02,193 --> 00:17:03,173
♫  You~  ♫

190
00:17:03,173 --> 00:17:05,573
Even Senior left like that.

191
00:17:05,573 --> 00:17:11,393
If even you die because of me, how can I live?

192
00:17:11,393 --> 00:17:12,763
♫  Even my naive and difficult love  ♫

193
00:17:12,763 --> 00:17:15,953
What about Senior?

194
00:17:15,953 --> 00:17:18,613
What happened?

195
00:17:18,613 --> 00:17:21,203
♫  Always blow from same place  ♫

196
00:17:21,203 --> 00:17:24,833
Dan, h-how...

197
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,763
What shall we do?

198
00:17:26,763 --> 00:17:28,903
♫  ...permeates me  ♫

199
00:17:28,903 --> 00:17:32,833
♫  You never leave my mind  ♫

200
00:17:42,713 --> 00:17:45,813
There might be nothing left.

201
00:17:45,813 --> 00:17:50,183
Since Senior isn't here anymore, his room may have also disappeared.

202
00:17:51,223 --> 00:17:54,673
Wait here for a bit. I'll go in.

203
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:56,723
Let's go together.

204
00:18:02,403 --> 00:18:04,523
Let's be together.

205
00:19:05,033 --> 00:19:07,163
What's this?

206
00:19:11,003 --> 00:19:13,033
A report.

207
00:19:19,093 --> 00:19:23,443
 I never thought I would ever write my last report. 

208
00:19:25,183 --> 00:19:30,003
 When was the first time I went against Your will and disobeyed You? 

209
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:31,083
 Wow. 

210
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,083
 Those little kittens are cute. 

211
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:37,913
 The more I crossed the line, the more I began to question myself. 

212
00:19:37,913 --> 00:19:40,493
 Angels must only be bystanders. 

213
00:19:40,493 --> 00:19:42,623
 If I can save her, I should. 

214
00:19:42,623 --> 00:19:46,443
 That's a good deed and the duty of an angel. 

215
00:19:49,573 --> 00:19:51,833
 I'll never be able to  

216
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:56,313
 understand Your big plan for Dan and Yeon Seo. 

217
00:19:56,313 --> 00:19:58,833
 However, I know for sure 

218
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:03,593
 that they have earned the right, 

219
00:20:03,593 --> 00:20:06,043
 because they worked hard for it. 

220
00:20:06,043 --> 00:20:10,033
 Please. I ask that You give them a chance. 

221
00:20:11,983 --> 00:20:17,753
    

222
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,603
Senior,

223
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:54,783
I also really liked you.

224
00:20:56,593 --> 00:20:58,953
I wanted to become...

225
00:20:58,953 --> 00:21:00,933
♫   I've seen them in my dreams ♫ 

226
00:21:00,933 --> 00:21:04,263
...an angel like you.

227
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,573
Even till the end,

228
00:21:06,573 --> 00:21:07,283
♫  Now I'm  ♫

229
00:21:07,283 --> 00:21:10,503
...you were so cool

230
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:17,483
that I can't even imitate you.

231
00:21:21,223 --> 00:21:23,153
♫   And when I close my eyes ♫ 

232
00:21:23,153 --> 00:21:25,283
I won't forget you...

233
00:21:26,503 --> 00:21:28,653
ever.

234
00:21:28,653 --> 00:21:33,923
♫  Feel your presence near.  ♫

235
00:21:35,943 --> 00:21:39,883
♫   Stay this way for good ♫ 

236
00:21:39,883 --> 00:21:43,763
Thank you.

237
00:21:45,033 --> 00:21:47,233
♫   ...with you ♫ 

238
00:21:52,163 --> 00:21:54,363
♫   Just stay ♫ 

239
00:21:54,363 --> 00:21:58,253
♫  Stay without my grace  ♫

240
00:21:59,513 --> 00:22:02,113
♫  in here  ♫

241
00:22:06,843 --> 00:22:09,193
♫   I'll stay ♫ 

242
00:22:09,193 --> 00:22:13,073
♫   Stay with me this way ♫ 

243
00:22:14,263 --> 00:22:17,333
♫   Just you ♫ 

244
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:21,833
Senior gave us time

245
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,833
as a gift.

246
00:22:27,093 --> 00:22:31,793
We both couldn't have lived if it wasn't for Sunbae.

247
00:22:37,313 --> 00:22:40,263
Let's not waste time, not even for a moment.

248
00:22:40,263 --> 00:22:46,273
Without getting hurt or dying, let's live happily.

249
00:23:24,973 --> 00:23:27,093
Because of that guy,

250
00:23:27,093 --> 00:23:30,103
everything became a mess after he showed up.

251
00:23:31,203 --> 00:23:33,633
I won't ever let him be.

252
00:23:39,713 --> 00:23:43,123
     

253
00:23:44,663 --> 00:23:46,593
  Sis, where are you?  

254
00:23:46,593 --> 00:23:49,743
I thought you wanted me to ignore you. Why?

255
00:23:49,743 --> 00:23:52,093
I was wondering if you were okay.

256
00:24:09,283 --> 00:24:11,223
Ni Na.

257
00:24:15,313 --> 00:24:19,423
Sis, I'm sorry.

258
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,813
Ms. Geum Roo Na, you're under arrest for murder,

259
00:24:26,813 --> 00:24:30,883
attempted murder, obstruction of business, and injury.

260
00:24:30,883 --> 00:24:33,843
Geum Ni Na, you...

261
00:24:33,843 --> 00:24:35,733
Take her away.

262
00:24:46,663 --> 00:24:48,863
Check those drawers, too.

263
00:25:01,513 --> 00:25:04,793
Remain on standby and do not leave your home.

264
00:25:04,793 --> 00:25:06,673
Do you understand?

265
00:25:20,753 --> 00:25:23,713
Honey, don't be like this.

266
00:25:24,863 --> 00:25:29,533
I did so many wrong things. It's all my fault.

267
00:25:29,533 --> 00:25:34,503
With my greed and envy,

268
00:25:34,503 --> 00:25:37,233
I made my daughter that way.

269
00:25:37,233 --> 00:25:42,213
What do I do? What do I do?

270
00:25:43,653 --> 00:25:46,863
She got arrested! They arrested Geum Roo Na.

271
00:25:46,863 --> 00:25:50,243
- When?
 - Detective Go called me now.

272
00:25:50,243 --> 00:25:52,233
It's all finished. Everything is resolved.

273
00:25:52,233 --> 00:25:53,843
There wasn't enough evidence.

274
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:57,353
I thought it'd be hard to get her after Uncle took the blame.

275
00:25:57,353 --> 00:26:02,423
Roo Na's underling, Ki Joon Soo, is dead,

276
00:26:02,423 --> 00:26:05,413
but they found all the evidence on his phone.

277
00:26:05,413 --> 00:26:09,303
There was proof that he threatened and controlled Moon Ji Woong and that he had connections with Roo Na.

278
00:26:09,303 --> 00:26:12,323
He has done all the dirty work alone all these years.

279
00:26:12,323 --> 00:26:14,323
Wasn't he scared he'd be punished?

280
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:16,863
He was punished by fate.

281
00:26:16,863 --> 00:26:20,273
Someone punished him.

282
00:26:20,273 --> 00:26:25,903
That's good. You can now focus on your performance.

283
00:26:25,903 --> 00:26:28,463
Butler Jeong, I...

284
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:34,313
It's Director Ji.

285
00:26:37,833 --> 00:26:40,463
Let's go practice.

286
00:26:40,463 --> 00:26:43,083
I'm certain I told you I don't want to.

287
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:46,783
Right now, it's a shame that I've to waste my time on you,

288
00:26:46,783 --> 00:26:49,233
- so—
 - Even after Dan leaves, you will have to live.

289
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:50,483
Watch your mouth.

290
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:52,913
He's right.

291
00:26:52,913 --> 00:26:54,213
Dan.

292
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:57,113
I want that more than anyone.

293
00:26:57,113 --> 00:27:01,253
For you to keep on living even if I leave.

294
00:27:01,253 --> 00:27:05,623
Can't you think of this stage as the last chance for the two of you?

295
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:10,373
It's the final chance for your love to be heard in Heaven.

296
00:27:10,373 --> 00:27:12,873
What are you saying?

297
00:27:12,873 --> 00:27:17,763
At first, I thought I could die in peace after creating

298
00:27:17,763 --> 00:27:20,653
a perfect performance of Seol Hee's dream.

299
00:27:20,653 --> 00:27:24,063
That was my will and I wanted God to know it.

300
00:27:24,063 --> 00:27:28,113
That's why I was so obsessed with it.

301
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:30,793
I wanted that desperately to die.

302
00:27:30,793 --> 00:27:33,143
Now I want to live.

303
00:27:33,143 --> 00:27:37,893
Something like that happened to me, too, so please don't give up.

304
00:27:37,893 --> 00:27:42,763
A miracle could happen.

305
00:27:50,953 --> 00:27:54,733
  Starting now, listen carefully to what i'm going to say.  

306
00:27:56,493 --> 00:28:00,993
 Those two fools finally chose to risk their lives. 

307
00:28:02,033 --> 00:28:04,653
 Where are they now? 

308
00:28:04,653 --> 00:28:06,483
 You still feel guilty, don't you? 

309
00:28:06,483 --> 00:28:10,883
 Thinking that it's all your fault that she died and you didn't. 

310
00:28:18,293 --> 00:28:20,493
 You have to do something to let someone live. 

311
00:28:20,493 --> 00:28:23,823
 Help Yeon Seo to go on and live her life. 

312
00:28:23,823 --> 00:28:28,363
 That's the only way your soul can find peace. 

313
00:28:46,893 --> 00:28:48,653
Nothing is certain.

314
00:28:48,653 --> 00:28:51,483
Even if I dance, how should I do it? What does it mean to perform well?

315
00:28:51,483 --> 00:28:54,953
Then, what will happen?

316
00:28:59,273 --> 00:29:01,473
Let's go.

317
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:03,263
Where to?

318
00:29:03,263 --> 00:29:07,699
