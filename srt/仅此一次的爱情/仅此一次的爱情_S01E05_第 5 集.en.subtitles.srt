1
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,217
-I mean--
-Hey.

2
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,427
-I...
-Did I...

3
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,324
What are you doing?

4
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:58,743
I'm sorry.

5
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,328
I'm sorry, Yeon-seo.

6
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:15,969
Darn it!

7
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:24,435
Come here.

8
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,938
-This way.
-It's raining!

9
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,982
-Go to the side!
-It's raining!

10
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,942
Why are you doing this to me?

11
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:39,951
Thank you.

12
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:41,911
I almost got caught.

13
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,165
My wings!

14
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:55,133
Goodness, my brother.

15
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,094
Please come to your senses.

16
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:00,471
That jerk.

17
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,057
That pervert. That phony religious jerk.

18
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:31,252
I'm sorry I'm late.

19
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,048
Where's Mr. Kim?

20
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:38,509
Let's go.

21
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:06,829
I'm fine.

22
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,581
Summer rain can give you a cold too.

23
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:11,334
And you get a fever when you catch a cold.

24
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:12,794
Do I?

25
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,213
You're wrong.

26
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,132
You get a fever when you catch a cold.

27
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,217
Come here.

28
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,222
Stay still.

29
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:31,604
You shouldn't get sick.

30
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:36,192
From now on, you must never
get sick or injured.

31
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,820
You shouldn't be alone either.

32
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,120
A Pilates instructor will come over
in the morning.

33
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,288
Check your condition.

34
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:51,082
Do cardio exercise and weight training
in the morning and stretch after that.

35
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:52,417
You'll start getting back in shape.

36
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,377
Take a breath.

37
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:55,878
Why are you in a hurry?

38
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,505
You need to prepare yourself for war.

39
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:58,965
From tomorrow,

40
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,384
no, from now on, it's war.

41
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,385
I can take care of myself.

42
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,012
Then why did you get drenched?

43
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:07,181
You're the one who dropped the bomb.

44
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:10,435
You announced your own comeback.

45
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,104
A dancer is someone
who speaks with their body.

46
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,689
I regained my sight,

47
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,358
and nothing is wrong with
my body and mind.

48
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,776
I will show you more in detail

49
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:21,696
through my dance at my return performance.

50
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,074
Are you sure you're physically
and mentally healthy?

51
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:28,911
Just look at me.

52
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:31,831
Imagine that it's just

53
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:34,000
you and me in this world.

54
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,212
Yes, I am.

55
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,048
I'm completely fine.

56
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:52,101
People are more excited to hear about
others' failure more than their success.

57
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:55,021
Those who applauded your comeback

58
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,273
will be the first ones

59
00:05:57,356 --> 00:05:59,150
to criticize you if you fail.

60
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:01,903
You're on the edge of a cliff.

61
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:03,654
Whether it be a cliff
or the fiery pits of hell,

62
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:06,324
it's me who's there, not you.

63
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,659
I'm the one in charge of
your comeback performance.

64
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,829
If you fail, it will humiliate me too.

65
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,414
Two weeks.

66
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,708
I'll give you two weeks.

67
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:16,918
Get your body back in shape

68
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:18,753
and receive my approval first.

69
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,129
If you fail,

70
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,590
Keum Ni-na will be
the prima ballerina of Fantasia.

71
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,425
One week.

72
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,137
That's all I need.

73
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,558
Ni-na. Where are you?

74
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:33,810
Ni-na.

75
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,356
Ni-na.

76
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,486
Why are you out here?

77
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,029
Ru-na.

78
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,575
Director Ji.

79
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,078
I have something to tell you.

80
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,955
Next time. I have an appointment.

81
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,374
Are you meeting Yeon-seo?

82
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,545
That's none of your business.

83
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,008
Don't go.

84
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,510
Keum Ni-na.

85
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,303
You told me to be selfish.

86
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,056
I'm going to

87
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,392
like you.

88
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,144
No.

89
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:17,979
I already do.

90
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,111
I'll pretend that I didn't hear that.

91
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:27,905
It was since that night.

92
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,992
That night when you touched my ankle.

93
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:37,748
It felt like a big rock
had fallen into my heart.

94
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,127
Why today?

95
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,463
Your biggest rival announced

96
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,090
her comeback after a three-year gap.

97
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,300
But on a day like this,

98
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:48,885
you decided to listen

99
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:52,346
to your useless emotions
and confessed to me.

100
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,223
I'm disappointed in you.

101
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:55,766
"Useless"?

102
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,435
Let's not waste any time.

103
00:07:57,768 --> 00:08:00,980
I'm not Prince Charming
like you think I am.

104
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,440
Then you can tell me.

105
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,192
That's what I'm most curious about.

106
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:08,237
What kind of person are you?

107
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:09,655
I'm an evil person.

108
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,326
I'm beyond what you can imagine or handle.

109
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,495
I'm very evil.

110
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:22,627
I shouldn't have told him. I was too rash.

111
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,545
When Yeon-seo returns,

112
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,797
I will become a shadow again.

113
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,342
And when that happens,
I thought he wouldn't

114
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,385
look at me even more than he does now.

115
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,929
I agree with him.

116
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,558
You already act like a shadow,
so who will take notice of you?

117
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,352
Why are you being so scary?

118
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,521
Where's your pride? Are you not angry?

119
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:44,774
You were looked down on as a ballerina
and also as a woman.

120
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,568
That makes me so upset.

121
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,155
But you're just being childish and crying.

122
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:52,573
Stop being a baby.

123
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,784
No one's going to fix this for you.

124
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,925
I said, go. Please go.

125
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,927
There's no emergency.
The rain has stopped.

126
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,637
It's getting late, so go.

127
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,846
Don't get kicked out again.

128
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:26,232
I feel like I did something wrong.

129
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,526
Is it possible for an angel
to feel guilty?

130
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,403
Can an angel commit a sin?

131
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,498
Answer me. Who are you?

132
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:47,253
I'm Kim Dan.

133
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,546
Don't tell me your human name.

134
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:49,714
Tell me your real name.

135
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,382
What are you?

136
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,469
I'm Angel Dan.

137
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,554
That's right.

138
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:59,223
Then you must know
what'll happen to an angel if he gives up

139
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,309
on his mission and commit a sin.

140
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:06,063
I didn't commit a sin.
It just feels like I did.

141
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,231
"Feels"?

142
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:09,942
You don't want to go up there, do you?

143
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,279
Would you like to
turn into dust right here?

144
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:14,488
Are you threatening me?

145
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,157
Are you an angel or a thug?

146
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:23,914
Come on!

147
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,468
I still have time left!

148
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:38,012
An angel should only be obedient.

149
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:40,389
If you have other intentions,
you'll only be doomed.

150
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,850
Just like how you can differentiate
what's holy from what's worldly,

151
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,644
and a good man from an evil one,

152
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,063
remember who is before you.

153
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,816
Just like how you've led cats and dogs,

154
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,611
it's the same for that woman, got it?

155
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,340
KIM DAN

156
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:23,284
Excuse me. I'd like a bottle of soju.

157
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:34,628
Thank you.

158
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:44,972
What brings you here?

159
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:46,432
What about you?

160
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,392
Why are you here at this hour?

161
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,395
Someone told me

162
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,981
that it is the best remedy
when my heart is on fire.

163
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,109
Okay, then.

164
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,740
Your heart is on fire?

165
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,502
Just quit if this is
how you'll do your job.

166
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,671
-Pardon?
-I'll get you a new job.

167
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,173
I can get you a better paying job.

168
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,510
A job that can accommodate your needs.

169
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:24,970
What if I say I don't want to?

170
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,847
"I don't want to"? Not, "I can't"?

171
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:28,557
-Why not?
-If I have to get fired,

172
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,476
I want it to be Yeon-seo who fires me.

173
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,479
This isn't your business to meddle with.

174
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:35,147
You said you were going to help me.

175
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,817
Have you forgotten
what you need to do? Or...

176
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,613
Or did you have a change of heart?

177
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,907
I keep my promises.

178
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:48,786
I'm going to fix you up
with Yeon-seo myself.

179
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,120
"Ms. Lee".

180
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,543
You keep calling her by her name.

181
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:56,752
That's been bothering me a lot.

182
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,171
Seeing how you drop your
honorifics to your boss,

183
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,756
I doubt that you're good at your job.

184
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:04,176
Why are you getting angry at me?

185
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,055
I've already seen her alone

186
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,558
in the rain twice.

187
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,894
You were worried because Yeon-seo

188
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:15,980
was alone.

189
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,107
Is that why you got angry?

190
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,067
Listen.

191
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,570
I'm asking why you're not
doing your job right...

192
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,198
What are you doing?

193
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:28,576
You're running a fever.

194
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,495
And your pupils are shaky too.

195
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:34,915
And you're nervous.

196
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,210
I was right. You're definitely angry.

197
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,966
I'm all for worrying about Ms. Lee.

198
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,092
I'm all for it,

199
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:48,095
but I'll take care of my job myself.

200
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,148
What was that?

201
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,819
She's a puppy or a kitty.

202
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,072
She's a pine tree or grass.

203
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:08,991
Yeon-seo is just a client.

204
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,160
After I make Yeon-seo fall in love,

205
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,621
I will go back up there no matter what.

206
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:35,976
I wasn't angry.

207
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,607
No. Actually, I was.

208
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:43,901
I'm so livid.

209
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:47,696
You were worried because Yeon-seo

210
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,281
was alone.

211
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:50,574
Is that why you got angry?

212
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:53,869
It's because of ballet.

213
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:55,704
I barely

214
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,040
managed to get you this far.

215
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,084
I just need to put you on the stage.

216
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,629
Then, I can keep my promise to you.

217
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:07,132
But how could you fall for
a mere secretary?

218
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,565
Why are all the curtains closed?

219
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:26,568
It's so dark in here.

220
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:36,620
Ms. Lee.

221
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,624
What are you doing here?

222
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,212
Did you stay up all night?

223
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,381
Absence without notice
and leaving the workplace

224
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,925
-can be reasons for dismissal, right?
-Are you talking about Dan?

225
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,468
Did something happen last night?

226
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:52,594
I know what your wishes are.

227
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,347
I will grant your wish.

228
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,269
Because I listened to you...

229
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,563
What did I do?

230
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,233
I see. You're talking about Dan?

231
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,736
-Him having a crush on you?
-He doesn't.

232
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:09,945
Apparently he doesn't.

233
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,114
Did you ask that to his face?

234
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,949
Of course, he'd deny that.

235
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:15,868
No, I didn't do that.

236
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,790
From now on, please refrain from

237
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,667
spreading and making groundless rumors.

238
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,630
There's no way my instincts are wrong.

239
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,675
Also, fire that jerk.

240
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,052
For good this time.

241
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,553
Good morning.

242
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,100
Did you sleep well?

243
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,185
Ms. Jung.

244
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:44,271
Tell him that staying out overnight can be
a reason for his dismissal.

245
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,692
Something urgent came up.

246
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,360
Please tell her that I'm sorry.

247
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,281
I'm sorry, Ms. Lee.

248
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,659
What's wrong with you?
Why are you so polite?

249
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,787
I've been overstepping my boundaries.

250
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,498
I will focus on my work from now on.

251
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,376
I'm glad to hear that.

252
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:08,670
I'm going to the studio to practice.

253
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,693
I have something to tell you.

254
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:35,864
Go ahead.

255
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:39,827
Last night...

256
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:45,290
I was...

257
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:55,926
I'm sorry about last night.

258
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:57,845
Please forget what happened.

259
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,350
What do you mean?

260
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,394
Nothing happened last night between us.

261
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:07,354
You and I...

262
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,649
Right. Nothing happened.

263
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,401
Nothing at all.

264
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:13,861
Something happened between us.

265
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,237
No, nothing happened.

266
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,488
No, it did.

267
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,408
What's your point, you jerk?

268
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:20,909
You told me to forget about it.

269
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,328
I'm trying to pretend that nothing
happened between us and move on.

270
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:24,371
Are you that clueless?

271
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:25,372
Can't you play along?

272
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:27,207
I can't lie that nothing happened
when it did.

273
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,417
To pretend that--

274
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,254
That's exactly my point.

275
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,922
I was going to tell you that first.

276
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:37,801
I need to practice and get back in shape,
so I don't have time for anything else.

277
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:39,761
Fine.

278
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,388
Pretend nothing happened last night.

279
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,765
And act as if we met

280
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,225
for the first time today.

281
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,188
I'm glad

282
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:50,772
that we are

283
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,567
on the same page.

284
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,070
Good then.

285
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,411
Tell me if you need anything.

286
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:05,829
Ms. Lee,

287
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,831
you can do it!

288
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:16,089
"You can do it"?

289
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,800
"I'm glad that we are on the same page."

290
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,554
I guess he's one of those guys

291
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,224
who can act like a kiss meant nothing.

292
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,975
Why? Because this happens
to him all the time?

293
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:29,853
Whatever.

294
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,188
I don't need him either.

295
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,496
THINGS LEE YEON-SEO HATES

296
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:51,458
105 THINGS YEON-SEO LIKES

297
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,890
Let's focus on my mission.
Think about my job.

298
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,308
There's a mission I must complete.

299
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,519
I cannot delay your love
and my return any longer now!

300
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:22,007
I know who you really are.

301
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,092
You were such a bright child.

302
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,804
If you got the eyes of someone like him,
then don't let them go to waste.

303
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,241
Ms. Lee, are you okay? Are you hurt?

304
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:30,575
Did you sprain your ankles?

305
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:31,743
Take your hands off.

306
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:35,205
-Pardon?
-Take your hands off,

307
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:37,457
you pervert, idiot, phony cult, con man!

308
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,252
If you lay a finger on my body once again,

309
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,337
I will fire you immediately.

310
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:43,755
Understand?

311
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,303
Yes, I understand.

312
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:53,431
I will be careful.

313
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:54,641
If you got it, get out of here.

314
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:56,476
Don't jump in before I call you.

315
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,209
Yes, Ni-na.

316
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,673
You mean Ms. Lee?

317
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:28,633
Yes, I am with her, but--

318
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,931
What is this?
Why did you call my secretary?

319
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,518
Is that you, Yeon-seo? Hi, Yeon-seo.

320
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,812
I called Dan because
I didn't know your number.

321
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,607
Can you come out for a second?

322
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:45,317
I don't want to.

323
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:46,818
I want to see you,

324
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,070
but you don't want to see me.

325
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:51,198
I don't. And I plan on
not wanting to see you.

326
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,033
So don't call my secretary.

327
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:56,286
You can't just hang up

328
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:58,788
like that.

329
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:00,457
How do you know her?

330
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,625
Are you two close?

331
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,627
I ran into her a few times by coincidence.

332
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,546
You've been going around
and hitting on women.

333
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,465
If you meet her a few more times,

334
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:10,300
you might make what
didn't happen come true.

335
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:12,802
Gureum, let's go for a walk.

336
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,150
Hey, Yeon-seo.

337
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:28,860
You came out.

338
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,779
Why are you standing there
looking pitiful?

339
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,449
Take this.

340
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,160
Congratulations on your rehab,
and I support you.

341
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,288
Dan, please.

342
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:41,456
Oh, yes.

343
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:47,254
This is a challenge for a competition.

344
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:49,589
I improved a lot
for the last three years too.

345
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:52,884
I want to officially compete against you.

346
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:56,805
Why are you all so determined?

347
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,390
Calling this a war and competition.

348
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:00,058
I hope you can return
to how you used to be.

349
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:03,144
I can only be acknowledged
after you get better.

350
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,314
Be prepared, Yeon-seo.

351
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:08,275
I'm going to try really hard too.

352
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:12,862
I'm done.

353
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,243
What a nice person.

354
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,080
What about me?

355
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,211
Should I put this in your room?

356
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:30,839
Throw it away.

357
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,173
After the press conference,

358
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,759
a total of 14 articles became top news

359
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,303
for daily papers and offline newspapers.

360
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,972
Over 200 related articles
were published online in a day.

361
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,893
Negative comments
because of the SNS incident,

362
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,687
turned into support and encouragement.

363
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,148
Over 80 percent of them
were positive comments.

364
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:55,905
We should keep this going
while it's going well.

365
00:26:56,406 --> 00:27:00,493
Seiji Ishikawa from Japan called us
in secret.

366
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,495
The man who's worth over trillions of won?

367
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:05,081
The biggest sponsor of Bolshoi Theater.

368
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:09,210
He's a second-generation Korean Japanese,
so he became interested in Korean ballet.

369
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:11,588
This is an opportunity

370
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:15,050
for Fantasia to become world-renowned.

371
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:17,052
So

372
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:18,970
when will you be done?

373
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:21,389
-Pardon?
-My dear

374
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:24,726
General Director Choi and Chairman Keum.

375
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,853
When will you two quit?

376
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:29,356
What do you mean?

377
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,815
The rumor got around.

378
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,734
She asked to take Fantasia back.

379
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:34,944
I'm not sure if we should be discussing

380
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:37,989
this important matter with someone
who'll quit soon.

381
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,240
Think about it.

382
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,117
The year's project completely changes

383
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:43,203
when just the artistic director changes.

384
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:45,205
There are a lot of steps
we must take before--

385
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,456
I can

386
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:51,461
give up on everything
and leave tomorrow if I must.

387
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,421
But I can't.

388
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:55,965
No, I won't.

389
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,301
I'm sure you all are aware of how much

390
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,846
love and passion I put into Fantasia

391
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,473
for the last three years.

392
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:05,642
I did all that

393
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:08,353
because of my love for Yeon-seo.

394
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:11,564
I wanted to give back
a stable ballet company

395
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,192
when my niece returns as a healthy woman.

396
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:16,069
But Yeon-seo is not healthy

397
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,737
physically and mentally.

398
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:20,532
I heard dancers can know
their own condition

399
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,617
the best.

400
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:27,122
Do you think she announced her return
without thinking about such things?

401
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,626
Do you have to see it to believe it?

402
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:40,051
I'm thinking of moving up
Fantasia's Night.

403
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,554
You can check her during the event.

404
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:48,810
Of course, the one who wants her
to be completely healed

405
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:52,605
is me.

406
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:53,940
Fantasia's Night?

407
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,818
It's our year-end event that we have
for sponsorship.

408
00:28:56,901 --> 00:29:00,071
We break up in teams, put on performances,
hold a party, and greet people too.

409
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:01,781
-You know, don't you?
-I do.

410
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,284
But you usually do it
at the end of the year,

411
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:05,785
after you're done with big performances.

412
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:07,620
Because you and Yeon-seo

413
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:10,206
wreaked havoc on the ballet company,

414
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,958
all of our schedules got messed up.

415
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:15,420
So you two need to get
dressed up and come.

416
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,714
-Yeon-seo too?
-She's the owner here.

417
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:19,632
Of course, she should welcome her guests.

418
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:23,303
We're expecting
a very special guest from Japan.

419
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:26,473
Seiji Ishikawa. You know him, don't you?

420
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:27,891
Of course, I do.

421
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:29,934
A big sponsor of the ballet world,

422
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,853
and an old man with dirty hands.

423
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:34,022
All art requires money.

424
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,607
And to correct what you said,

425
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:38,359
Mr. Seiji is known for giving out

426
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,861
countless amount of his dirty money

427
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:43,823
when he likes what he sees.

428
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,950
Making the ballerinas stand

429
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:48,328
next to the sponsors
as if they're flowers?

430
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,621
I don't do that.

431
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:53,500
I am not going to make
my ballerinas do that.

432
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:00,590
He only calls them "my ballerinas"
at a time like this.

433
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:03,092
He cares about no one other than Yeon-seo.

434
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:04,677
She's the lead role.

435
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:07,430
She is our lead role for sure.

436
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:24,364
Straighten your knee.

437
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:27,659
Up to here.

438
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:32,205
More. More!

439
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:39,295
Put your chest in.

440
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,433
What's the repertoire
for Fantasia's Night?

441
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,229
Are we getting ready for that already?

442
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:58,189
The night has been moved up.

443
00:30:58,606 --> 00:30:59,983
We don't need to do anything special.

444
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:01,568
Let's just put on
what we always have done.

445
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,006
Is something wrong?

446
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,842
I think we were in great harmony just now.

447
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,051
Right?

448
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:33,975
Ni-na.

449
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,101
Yes, Director Ji.

450
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:37,103
Can you take charge
for the rest of the practice?

451
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,764
Rib.

452
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:13,932
It's her first practice today.

453
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,224
Why are you so quiet?

454
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:17,644
He was so angry last time
as if he would devour me.

455
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,896
RIB

456
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:23,149
He'll manage it. Won't he?

457
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:29,906
Gosh, that shocked me.

458
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,996
You want me to stand here like this?

459
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:40,458
Don't say anything,

460
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,169
and just stand there.

461
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,697
One second!

462
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,788
Hey!

463
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,251
Goodness, Ms. Jung.

464
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,300
You have a guest.

465
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:29,567
The temperature and humidity level
are great.

466
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:30,985
The mirror is clean too.

467
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:32,653
And it's bright.

468
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,323
Are you here to watch over me?

469
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,699
I came because I wanted to see you.

470
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,577
I was worried about the place

471
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:42,121
and the environment which you practice in.

472
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:45,875
You really don't need
a trainer or a masseuse?

473
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,252
I am still worried that you are doing this

474
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:49,545
all alone.

475
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:50,963
I'm not alone.

476
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,132
I have him.

477
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:54,675
And Ms. Jung.

478
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,511
Even if I was alone,

479
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:57,762
I can manage it.

480
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:01,474
Fantasia's Night

481
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,060
will be held in two weeks.

482
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:08,314
Let us decide how you will participate
depending on your condition in a week.

483
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,983
We'll see if you'll be there
as a ballerina

484
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,569
or as the chairwoman of the foundation.

485
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:17,115
That's a long way of saying
that I should be prepared.

486
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,909
I'm sorry for taking so much of your time.
Goodbye.

487
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:22,995
Oh, Mr. Kim.

488
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:24,580
I need to see you.

489
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:26,332
-Me?
-Just for a second.

490
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:27,792
I have a question.

491
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,057
What is it? I have to go back soon.

492
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,520
-What are you doing?
-Who are you?

493
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:49,272
Let me ask you again. What

494
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:50,857
are you after?

495
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:54,193
Were you trying to approach me first
to see how Yeon-seo feels?

496
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:57,155
Did you comfort me saying you'll help out,
only to betray me later?

497
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:17,425
Are you after her money?

498
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,010
Are you a gigolo?

499
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:21,053
Did you get a job here as a secretary

500
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,805
and get her to like you to take her money?

501
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:26,726
What are you talking about?

502
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,394
Taking whose money? That's nonsense.

503
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,315
I was never interested in
the wealth of this world.

504
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:34,942
I don't want those things
that will rot away.

505
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:37,236
Then what? Do you really like her?

506
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:40,948
Wait, what?

507
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:41,866
Hey.

508
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:44,911
You and Yeon-seo
belong in two different worlds.

509
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,165
I know that more than anyone.

510
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:50,625
If you do, give up quickly.

511
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:53,377
Don't get your hopes up like a fool.

512
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:56,923
If you disturb her comeback
because of your petty emotions,

513
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,967
I will not forgive you. Do you understand?

514
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:09,977
Who likes whom?

515
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:12,813
What?

516
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:15,399
Hu, where are you?

517
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:18,694
Hu.

518
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:19,820
Hu!

519
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:21,572
Hu, it's an emergency.

520
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:22,698
Hu!

521
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,082
I have a question.

522
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:33,834
Perfect. A man in this robe
is an expert at listening.

523
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:34,794
Go ahead.

524
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,171
Here?

525
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,382
Have you ever kissed a human?

526
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:44,470
A human?

527
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:46,973
What are you saying?

528
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:52,687
What? What now?

529
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,063
Tell me. What is it?

530
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:56,065
Why do you suddenly pop up like this?

531
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:59,318
Well, you can take on a human body
whenever you want, right?

532
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:02,238
Your wings don't suddenly pop out
as if they are broken. Right?

533
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:04,573
Yes, so what?

534
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:05,491
I think

535
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,702
it's because of this body.

536
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:09,287
Hey, forget about your body.

537
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,664
Do you want to just become
the universe's dust and disappear?

538
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:14,166
My mission isn't over yet.

539
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:16,043
And about that mission.

540
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:22,049
I have to help her find her love, right?

541
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,343
But does that have to be
love between a human

542
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:26,887
and another human?

543
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:30,016
It has to be, right?

544
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:36,856
I somehow ended up kissing her.

545
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:39,025
Ever since then,
my heart beats uncontrollably

546
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:40,860
as if it's broken.

547
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,863
And then sometimes,
I suddenly feel suffocated.

548
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:45,573
Rib asked me

549
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,326
if I have feelings

550
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:50,244
for Yeon-seo.

551
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:51,454
Goodness.

552
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:53,372
What am I going to do with you?

553
00:38:58,627 --> 00:38:59,628
Let's see.

554
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,756
It was about 15 years ago.

555
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:05,259
There was an angel
who was in charge of the arts.

556
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,892
He took on the human form

557
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,144
and was given a mission

558
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:16,896
to inspire artists.

559
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:41,003
Just when he was growing tired of
bad-tempered artists,

560
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,172
he met this person.

561
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,194
I heard there's a chance
you can get confused.

562
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:49,363
That angel who was in charge of the arts

563
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:52,074
got inspiration

564
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,742
confused with love.

565
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,705
An angel fell in love
with another being other than the deity?

566
00:40:58,372 --> 00:40:59,373
Is that possible?

567
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:34,658
From this moment on...

568
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,160
No.

569
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,537
From the very beginning,

570
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:41,790
my love belonged to her.

571
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:43,876
I believe that you're the one

572
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:46,253
who helped us to meet

573
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:49,089
and made us fall in love.

574
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,842
So please bless us.

575
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:58,098
Believing that you can love something
other than the deity

576
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,559
is an act of arrogance and sin.

577
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:05,439
What happened to that angel then?

578
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:14,990
What do you think happened to an angel
who abandoned the deity?

579
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:25,084
Angel Dan, receive your judgment.

580
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:27,127
You dared to...

581
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,004
I want to live.

582
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:32,299
You dared to meddle in the life
that the deity had control over.

583
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:35,469
I like you so much

584
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:37,388
that it's driving me insane.

585
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:41,100
You neglected and forgot
your mission, given to you by the deity.

586
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:43,060
By not carrying it out, you have sinned.

587
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:45,354
Just look at me.

588
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:48,566
Imagine that it's just
you and me in this world.

589
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:49,984
Above all,

590
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,444
you've deluded yourself into thinking

591
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,698
that you loved an insignificant being
more than the deity.

592
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:59,827
You will be dissipated.

593
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:48,584
-Dan.
-Ma'am, what is it?

594
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:50,544
It's been hours.

595
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,755
She's refusing to eat and
not letting anyone in.

596
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:53,232
That's enough.

597
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,567
Don't overextend yourself.

598
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:06,537
I said that's enough.

599
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:11,125
Did you forget?

600
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:13,085
You shouldn't touch me.

601
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:18,590
You're bleeding.

602
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:26,181
So what?

603
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:32,688
My toenails have fallen off many times.

604
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:34,857
I've thrown away countless pairs
of bloody pointe shoes.

605
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:36,191
This is nothing.

606
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:44,575
Finally,

607
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:46,994
they look like a ballerina's feet.

608
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,880
I didn't know you had to push yourself

609
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:00,632
this much.

610
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:03,886
You're going through so much pain.

611
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:09,766
Let's call it a day, okay?

612
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:14,229
Don't be ridiculous.

613
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:16,148
I made a promise to Director Ji.

614
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:19,234
I have to get back in shape within a week.

615
00:46:22,779 --> 00:46:23,697
Listen to me.

616
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,365
You can't continue
practicing with this foot.

617
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:26,867
What if you get injured?

618
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:30,287
Are you going to return to being someone
who's in solitude and grumpy?

619
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:32,956
None of this matters if you're unhappy.

620
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:39,338
I hate you.

621
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:43,300
Don't be worried about me.
Don't care for me.

622
00:46:43,383 --> 00:46:44,343
I hate

623
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:47,387
receiving love.

624
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:50,098
It makes me want to become weak.

625
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:55,103
It makes me think it is okay to be weak.

626
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:00,400
I thought you liked me.

627
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:03,570
I really did.

628
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,782
You said you existed because of me.

629
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:09,952
You were the one who sweet-talked me.

630
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:13,288
If you're neither a liar nor a spy,
then there's only one conclusion.

631
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:16,542
Do you like me?

632
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:20,045
Believing that you can love something
other than the deity

633
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:22,631
is an act of arrogance and sin.

634
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:24,550
You said you couldn't lie.

635
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:27,553
Just say yes or no.

636
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:30,806
Did you like me?

637
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:36,061
Do you?

638
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:48,240
No.

639
00:47:57,916 --> 00:47:59,167
All right, then.

640
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:04,464
Get lost.

641
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,666
I had almost made a mistake,

642
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,002
but I am currently
carrying out my mission.

643
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:43,295
This is Angel Dan.

644
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:49,718
My subject has begun dancing once again.

645
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:54,222
She is very sensitive and hot-tempered.

646
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:54,700
I'm struggling alone without receiving

647
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:56,827
any signs or prophecies.

648
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,139
At first, her temper was the problem.

649
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,850
But now, she's too busy

650
00:50:21,017 --> 00:50:22,644
to love anyone.

651
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:25,981
Could there be a way

652
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:30,402
for her to succeed
in both ballet and love?

653
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:34,740
YEON-SEO'S GROWTH LOG

654
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:50,714
YEONHWA ISLAND, 2005

655
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:54,968
THE DAY I STARTED BALLET ONCE AGAIN!
MY FIRST STAGE AND MY FIRST AUDIENCE!

656
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:03,226
You're unbelievable!

657
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:05,771
Ms. Lee!

658
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:08,857
Wake up.

659
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:10,776
It's morning!

660
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,572
What is the date today? What day is it?

661
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:16,573
It's D-Day.

662
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:18,825
It's been exactly a week
since your announcement.

663
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:23,789
You shouldn't have stayed up
all night to practice.

664
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:25,540
You get a zero for not
taking care of yourself.

665
00:51:31,087 --> 00:51:33,590
Your aunt called so
many times this morning.

666
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:36,676
Look at this.

667
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,428
She calls me every five minutes.

668
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:44,267
It's me.

669
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:47,604
Now?

670
00:51:56,321 --> 00:51:57,989
You didn't come with your secretary today.

671
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:00,367
Please wait outside for me.

672
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:08,250
You never answer my questions.

673
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:10,544
How do you feel? Are you all right?

674
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:11,753
Give me the withdrawal agreement

675
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:13,380
on the power of attorney.
I brought my seal.

676
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:15,549
My gosh, that's not ready yet.

677
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:18,218
You said I had to sign it today.
That's why you told me to come out.

678
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:19,594
Is that what you told her?

679
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:23,390
My attorney is very meticulous.

680
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:25,851
So my attorney needs to
check it a few more times.

681
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:27,269
I'm sorry.

682
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:29,187
-I'll get going then.
-Wait.

683
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:32,190
Have some tea before you go.
I'm your aunt.

684
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:34,651
We're not that close, you know.

685
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:35,569
You must have been

686
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:37,487
very disappointed in me.

687
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:40,115
To make up for that...

688
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:52,210
-What's this?
-It's Fantasia's Night next week.

689
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:53,753
Wear them to the event.

690
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,631
You know that I never
serve my guests at events.

691
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:59,384
A very important Japanese
investor will be coming.

692
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:01,553
When I told him your name,
he said he'd come.

693
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:04,764
We can't hold the show
for your return without his money.

694
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:07,100
Sometimes, you must do things
you don't want to.

695
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:08,476
That's the world of adults.

696
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,854
We decided to announce
that everything related to Fantasia

697
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:15,775
will belong to you at the
event that day in front of our sponsors.

698
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:23,366
See how nice it is to start dancing again.

699
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:27,120
You can walk with me like this
even without Dan.

700
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:30,332
He has no place to go.

701
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:31,666
Where did he go on his vacation?

702
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:34,878
Well...

703
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:37,005
What did he say?

704
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:39,174
No. Don't tell me.

705
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:41,843
Bosses who ask about
vacation spots are the worst.

706
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:46,014
On the day of Fantasia's Night,

707
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:49,142
I'll make him escort you no matter what.

708
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:53,271
Let's hurry. I need to practice.

709
00:54:09,287 --> 00:54:11,790
I couldn't make him wait
at an empty house.

710
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:24,094
This has been the longest week this year.

711
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:25,929
Are you ready?

712
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:28,848
No, not at all. I'm totally doomed.

713
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:30,892
It's all a mess.

714
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:33,478
Yeon-seo.

715
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:36,439
What?

716
00:54:38,274 --> 00:54:40,151
Make yourself comfortable.
This will take long.

717
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:44,531
-Where are we going?
-Well...

718
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:46,491
To the beginning.

719
00:56:28,384 --> 00:56:29,427
This place...

720
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:30,512
Do you remember?

721
00:56:31,387 --> 00:56:32,555
This feels familiar.

722
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:36,267
What is this?

723
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:38,937
What are you plotting?
Why did we come all the way here?

724
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,021
In 2005,

725
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,232
right before you went to Russia
for your studies,

726
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:45,193
you went to an island
for a program called Visiting Ballet.

727
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:46,861
How do you know that?

728
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:48,446
Did you look into my past?

729
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:52,867
Dan told you, right?

730
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:54,744
She never misses a thing.

731
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:56,579
I bet

732
00:56:57,163 --> 00:56:58,456
Dan did everything here, right?

733
00:56:58,915 --> 00:56:59,999
Hey, Dan.

734
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:01,918
Where are you? Come on out.

735
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:04,504
Darn it. What's wrong with her?

736
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:06,548
You're my prima ballerina.

737
00:57:06,631 --> 00:57:09,217
You don't think I would know
when you were born and how you grew up?

738
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:16,558
I heard you hid and cried
because you didn't want to do ballet.

739
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:20,437
I didn't know that. How did he know that?

740
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:24,732
I knew a kid.

741
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:26,734
I've totally forgotten about the kid.

742
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:28,403
That kid was

743
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:30,071
my first audience.

744
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:33,241
I danced for him.

745
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:35,577
Just for him.

746
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:36,911
Today,

747
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:38,830
I'll watch your dance.

748
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:41,166
The dance you did for your first audience.

749
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:44,210
I don't remember. I didn't have
a routine because I was a kid.

750
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:51,676
I can't make the turns.

751
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:56,890
I can pull off other techniques

752
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:59,517
once I get my muscles in shape
and practice more.

753
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:03,313
But I can't make the turns.

754
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:06,858
That's expected.

755
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:10,737
You didn't dance for three years.
And it's been a week.

756
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:12,572
Did you think I'd expect
you to be perfect?

757
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:15,074
You're too confident of yourself.

758
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:20,830
I wanted to see how determined you were.

759
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,167
Your rhomboids,

760
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:26,586
spinal erectors, and the soleus muscles.

761
00:58:27,128 --> 00:58:29,047
It took you a week to get them into shape.

762
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:30,798
It's a miracle.

763
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:36,846
Well said, Rib.

764
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:37,972
Take it easy.

765
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:40,934
Don't worry about turnout,
balance, or anything else.

766
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:42,268
Dance like your first time.

767
01:01:56,921 --> 01:01:58,214
Good news.

768
01:01:59,006 --> 01:02:00,717
It looks like cold-hearted Yeon-seo

769
01:02:01,509 --> 01:02:03,511
who was like an empty noisy gong,

770
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:07,974
is finally about to start something.

771
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:11,436
Her beginnings will seem humble,

772
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:14,731
but love will be waiting for her
at the end, right?

773
01:02:16,524 --> 01:02:18,359
I am about to finish my mission.

774
01:02:19,944 --> 01:02:20,778
But

775
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:23,406
why is my heart

776
01:02:24,615 --> 01:02:25,616
in so much pain?

777
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:45,845
Why are you crying?

778
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:49,307
Were you disappointed?

779
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:54,562
That was so pretty.

780
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:58,483
That was the prettiest thing
I've ever seen.

781
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:42,902
You're smiling brightly, aren't you?

782
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:45,780
You look pretty.

783
01:03:45,863 --> 01:03:47,657
Don't you think this was a bit too much?

784
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:49,158
"She was beautiful.

785
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:51,702
It was the prettiest thing"

786
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:52,995
It's the truth!

787
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:53,996
I'll fight with you.

788
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:57,250
I want to see you become the center
of Fantasia.

789
01:03:57,917 --> 01:03:59,752
Think about how the chandelier fell.

790
01:04:00,169 --> 01:04:01,128
I'm just worried.

791
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:05,007
You save me and help me out.

792
01:04:05,299 --> 01:04:07,051
But why don't you like me?

793
01:04:07,426 --> 01:04:10,137
How can I not like you?
