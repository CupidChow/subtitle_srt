1
00:00:12,574 --> 00:00:14,334
 Yeon Seo! 

2
00:00:14,334 --> 00:00:19,364
 I clearly remember waving my hands at him 

3
00:00:19,364 --> 00:00:20,744
 from here. 

4
00:00:20,744 --> 00:00:25,044
 He ran everywhere around screaming that his girlfriend  

5
00:00:25,044 --> 00:00:27,144
 suddenly went missing. 

6
00:00:27,144 --> 00:00:29,244
 I wonder if he found her. 

7
00:00:30,814 --> 00:00:34,154
 Wait.  Was it you? 

8
00:00:34,154 --> 00:00:36,064
It wasn't me.

9
00:00:36,814 --> 00:00:41,024
I just collapsed here for a second, then...

10
00:00:41,024 --> 00:00:45,474
 Are you awake? How do you feel? Yeon Seo. 

11
00:00:45,474 --> 00:00:48,264
 Listen carefully. Yesterday, you... 

12
00:00:48,264 --> 00:00:51,484
No, that's not what happened.

13
00:00:52,994 --> 00:00:57,274
She must be mistaken. That wasn't me. That's not Dan either.

14
00:01:04,534 --> 00:01:12,464


15
00:01:18,414 --> 00:01:21,754
Wait. What's going on?

16
00:01:27,804 --> 00:01:30,034
 I'm not saving your life. 

17
00:01:36,604 --> 00:01:39,204
 No one can kill themselves 

18
00:01:40,154 --> 00:01:42,204
 with their eyes covered and hands tied. 

19
00:01:46,514 --> 00:01:50,824
What is this? Gosh, what's going on?

20
00:01:54,064 --> 00:01:58,624
 Are you okay? Look at me, Yeon Seo. 

21
00:01:58,624 --> 00:02:00,384
 It's me. 

22
00:02:15,964 --> 00:02:19,584
She regained her memory.

23
00:02:21,994 --> 00:02:25,564
I knew it was useless to seal her memory forcefully,

24
00:02:25,564 --> 00:02:28,184
but why did I do it anyway?

25
00:02:28,184 --> 00:02:32,714
Because I was afraid of what was to come?

26
00:02:36,504 --> 00:02:39,804
   
Kim Dan, are you...

27
00:02:41,724 --> 00:02:43,804
an angel?

28
00:02:45,944 --> 00:02:48,124
Answer me.

29
00:02:49,664 --> 00:02:52,514
You can't lie.

30
00:03:01,094 --> 00:03:02,704
Yes.

31
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,054
I'm an angel.

32
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:17,744
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

33
00:03:18,934 --> 00:03:21,814
It's all my fault.

34
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:25,814
But hear me out.

35
00:03:25,814 --> 00:03:27,734
No.

36
00:03:27,734 --> 00:03:29,524
I don't need to hear it.

37
00:03:37,154 --> 00:03:38,224
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:38,224 --> 00:03:42,174
It was your last chance. I told you that I wanted

39
00:03:42,824 --> 00:03:43,974
to trust you to the end.

40
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:48,434
That day, I was going to tell you right here.

41
00:03:49,864 --> 00:03:54,574
That I wasn't a human. That I was an angel.

42
00:03:54,574 --> 00:03:59,874
I was afraid that you would be disgusted and afraid of me.

43
00:03:59,874 --> 00:04:01,924
Despite all that, I was going to tell you the truth. But—

44
00:04:01,924 --> 00:04:03,534
But you couldn't because I was kidnapped?

45
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:07,484
How was I to tell you that you had almost died and that something horrible had happened?

46
00:04:07,484 --> 00:04:09,034
You're making an excuse.

47
00:04:09,034 --> 00:04:10,474
No, I'm trying to explain myself.

48
00:04:10,474 --> 00:04:16,424
You had many chances to do that. The day we first met, when you started working for me, when the chandelier fell on me, and when

49
00:04:16,424 --> 00:04:19,434
I held onto you and asked why you couldn't like me.

50
00:04:20,054 --> 00:04:22,134
You should've come clean then.

51
00:04:24,994 --> 00:04:27,134
If I had,

52
00:04:29,044 --> 00:04:31,604
would you have believed me?

53
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:34,604
Did you think I would have been shocked and fainted?

54
00:04:35,444 --> 00:04:39,304
What's so great about being an angel?

55
00:04:39,304 --> 00:04:45,324
Whether you're a vampire, a goblin, an alien, or whatnot, you should've told me.

56
00:04:46,394 --> 00:04:48,754
You're the one who doesn't trust me.

57
00:04:48,754 --> 00:04:50,694
And the fact...

58
00:04:51,394 --> 00:04:54,214
The fact that you don't trust me is infuriating.

59
00:04:54,214 --> 00:04:55,974
Got it?

60
00:05:16,174 --> 00:05:17,184
Yeon Seo.

61
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:18,894
Don't touch me.

62
00:05:19,494 --> 00:05:20,464
Are you okay?

63
00:05:20,464 --> 00:05:21,694
It's only a scratch. I'm fine.

64
00:05:21,694 --> 00:05:23,514
Let me see.

65
00:05:38,374 --> 00:05:42,614
What was that? Are you really...

66
00:05:42,614 --> 00:05:44,704
Are you really...

67
00:05:47,354 --> 00:05:49,054
You said you wouldn't be shocked.

68
00:05:49,054 --> 00:05:52,824
How could I not be shocked when a scar just disappeared in front of me?

69
00:05:53,434 --> 00:05:57,574
I get it. You're human.

70
00:05:58,474 --> 00:06:02,814
Do understand even if it's strange or disgusting.

71
00:06:02,814 --> 00:06:07,844
Because no matter how much you push me away, I'll be by your side.

72
00:06:09,164 --> 00:06:12,204
Are you giving me a notice? Don't you have a sense of shame?

73
00:06:12,204 --> 00:06:14,404
You're still in danger.

74
00:06:15,204 --> 00:06:19,314
Someone might harm you again.

75
00:06:19,314 --> 00:06:23,174
Thinking that you might still be in danger drives me insane!

76
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:27,304
So, just understand me.

77
00:06:28,124 --> 00:06:33,324
Don't act like you're doing me a favor. It's an angel's duty to save someone in danger.

78
00:06:33,324 --> 00:06:35,324
Just leave without resisting.

79
00:06:35,324 --> 00:06:37,384
I won't.

80
00:06:37,384 --> 00:06:40,844
If you keep doing this, I'll pretend like you're an invisible man.

81
00:06:40,844 --> 00:06:42,094
You're not even human to begin with.

82
00:06:42,094 --> 00:06:45,414
Fine! Just think of me as an annoying ghost.

83
00:06:45,414 --> 00:06:47,124
I'm seriously going to ignore you.

84
00:06:47,124 --> 00:06:48,264
Fine!

85
00:06:48,264 --> 00:06:49,934
Fine!

86
00:07:16,074 --> 00:07:18,894
I get that it could be appalling or disgusting.

87
00:07:18,894 --> 00:07:21,624
But still, as a human,

88
00:07:21,624 --> 00:07:25,824
shouldn't she thank me first? I saved her from falling off of a tall building.

89
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:34,714
He is really... an angel.

90
00:07:35,324 --> 00:07:37,304
He really is.

91
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:50,904
I witnessed it with my own eyes,

92
00:07:52,414 --> 00:07:54,694
yet I still can't believe it.

93
00:07:54,694 --> 00:07:56,404
It's me.

94
00:07:56,404 --> 00:07:58,514
- Don't you dare come in. 
- I'm coming in.

95
00:07:58,514 --> 00:08:00,744
Hey!

96
00:08:00,744 --> 00:08:02,164
Are you not going to listen to me?

97
00:08:02,164 --> 00:08:03,634
Just think of me as a ghost.

98
00:08:03,634 --> 00:08:06,794
How could I think of an angel as a ghost?

99
00:08:13,154 --> 00:08:17,484
Do you want me... to spend the night with you?

100
00:08:18,714 --> 00:08:22,494
What? Are you insane? Leave. Leave right now.

101
00:08:22,494 --> 00:08:25,824
Will you be all right being alone? You said you remembered everything.

102
00:08:26,394 --> 00:08:30,234
That means you remember what happened that night on the rooftop.

103
00:08:32,734 --> 00:08:37,754
♫  I just fall in love  ♫

104
00:08:37,754 --> 00:08:44,184
Don't worry. I won't ever let you go. I'll protect you.

105
00:08:44,184 --> 00:08:49,554
♫  Although I try to think of other things  ♫

106
00:08:49,554 --> 00:08:54,464
Is that... your mission?

107
00:08:54,464 --> 00:08:59,324
You said you were sent from above. You said you had to complete your mission.

108
00:08:59,324 --> 00:09:03,354
Did God really send you here

109
00:09:03,354 --> 00:09:08,534
to save me from danger? Are you

110
00:09:08,534 --> 00:09:10,694
my guardian angel?

111
00:09:10,694 --> 00:09:17,164
♫  in my heart.  Because of you  ♫

112
00:09:17,164 --> 00:09:21,844
♫  You~ Always  ♫

113
00:09:21,844 --> 00:09:28,064
Get up. I knew you would do this again. I knew you would be beating around the bush.

114
00:09:28,064 --> 00:09:30,104
Where are we going?

115
00:09:30,924 --> 00:09:35,734
♫  I will always love you, to you  ♫

116
00:09:39,074 --> 00:09:40,984
Sister,

117
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:44,824
I'd like to meet with the provost.

118
00:09:44,824 --> 00:09:48,874
I'm sorry, but he's not here at this moment.

119
00:10:01,024 --> 00:10:02,884
How could you bring her here?

120
00:10:02,884 --> 00:10:04,924
She remembered everything!

121
00:10:04,924 --> 00:10:07,014
My gosh, you little...

122
00:10:11,364 --> 00:10:14,374
Do you even transform to deceive people now?

123
00:10:17,904 --> 00:10:20,264
This is the same smell from last time.

124
00:10:20,734 --> 00:10:24,864
Is this smell from above as well?

125
00:10:33,034 --> 00:10:34,864
Hey!

126
00:10:46,724 --> 00:10:48,444
- It's so hot in here! 
- I know, right?

127
00:10:48,444 --> 00:10:49,394
Why is the light shining through?

128
00:10:49,394 --> 00:10:51,414
So you even set up your headquarters

129
00:10:51,414 --> 00:10:55,114
to deceive people and deprive them?

130
00:10:55,114 --> 00:10:59,314
Look at you. You're being quite... Is she always rude?

131
00:10:59,314 --> 00:11:00,304
Right. I think she is.

132
00:11:00,304 --> 00:11:03,564
He was an orphan? What was it about birds again?

133
00:11:03,564 --> 00:11:06,894
 Is this like an orphanage?  

134
00:11:06,894 --> 00:11:10,524
 He takes care of birds and humans 

135
00:11:10,524 --> 00:11:12,494
 who have no place to go. 

136
00:11:12,494 --> 00:11:14,914
 He said he had a father, but he was kicked out. 

137
00:11:14,914 --> 00:11:18,374
 You know who the father is around here. 

138
00:11:22,864 --> 00:11:25,474
I didn't ever say that he was an orphan.

139
00:11:25,474 --> 00:11:27,494
You told me not to look for him because it wasn't fate.

140
00:11:27,494 --> 00:11:31,194
 Your time is up. Only after time has passed by 

141
00:11:31,194 --> 00:11:33,494
 will you realize 

142
00:11:33,494 --> 00:11:35,844
 that this was the end of everything. 

143
00:11:35,844 --> 00:11:37,034
Ah, Senior!

144
00:11:37,034 --> 00:11:38,704
I wasn't lying.

145
00:11:38,704 --> 00:11:42,824
Do you know how heartbroken and desperate I was?

146
00:11:42,824 --> 00:11:44,914
I felt responsible for making him leave,

147
00:11:44,914 --> 00:11:47,444
so I felt guilty and was worried.

148
00:11:51,564 --> 00:11:53,944
You're a cult.

149
00:11:53,944 --> 00:11:56,324
A-A cult?

150
00:11:56,984 --> 00:11:58,644
This is extremely insulting.

151
00:11:58,644 --> 00:12:00,474
I was just like you in the beginning.

152
00:12:01,474 --> 00:12:05,004
I came here to tell you to never to deceive me again.

153
00:12:05,004 --> 00:12:08,484
You've always been beating around the bush.

154
00:12:08,484 --> 00:12:12,384
I won't allow that ever again. Got it?

155
00:12:12,384 --> 00:12:13,964
Yes.

156
00:12:13,964 --> 00:12:14,964
Are we clear on that?

157
00:12:14,964 --> 00:12:17,074
- Yes, we are. 
- Yes, yes.

158
00:12:17,074 --> 00:12:18,894
Of course.

159
00:12:18,894 --> 00:12:22,464
So, what's his mission?

160
00:12:22,464 --> 00:12:26,124
I'm sure he must have had a mission when he was sent to me from up above.

161
00:12:26,124 --> 00:12:28,064
What is it?

162
00:12:28,064 --> 00:12:31,794
♫  One, two, a one, two, three, four  ♫

163
00:12:33,134 --> 00:12:34,964
- You come back here! 
- Wait, wait.

164
00:12:34,964 --> 00:12:36,484
No!

165
00:12:36,484 --> 00:12:38,194
Set up me with whom?

166
00:12:38,194 --> 00:12:39,094
It's not that.

167
00:12:39,094 --> 00:12:41,424
How dare you pick my Rib? How dare you?

168
00:12:41,424 --> 00:12:43,634
At first, I wanted you to love anyone.

169
00:12:43,634 --> 00:12:46,424
Anyone? You must have no conscience!

170
00:12:46,424 --> 00:12:49,654
Do you know how diligent and picky those matchmaking agencies are?

171
00:12:49,654 --> 00:12:54,044
I regretted it right away! I wished that you would love me instead of someone...

172
00:12:54,554 --> 00:12:58,004
like him. That's what I thought.

173
00:12:59,344 --> 00:13:02,464
There you go again! Don't try to weasel your way out of this once again.

174
00:13:02,464 --> 00:13:04,954
I haven't forgiven you yet.

175
00:13:05,734 --> 00:13:08,134
Unbelievable. He just spits out what comes into his mind.

176
00:13:08,134 --> 00:13:10,684
Let's go together!

177
00:13:10,684 --> 00:13:12,754
♫  show that you love me  ♫

178
00:13:12,754 --> 00:13:19,184
♫  I want something sweeter, you see  ♫

179
00:13:19,184 --> 00:13:24,984
♫  Something to show, show that you love me  ♫

180
00:13:45,454 --> 00:13:51,764
What is... your goal in life, honey?

181
00:13:53,564 --> 00:13:55,574
Well,

182
00:13:56,234 --> 00:13:59,854
it's to see my daughters get married to nice men,

183
00:13:59,854 --> 00:14:05,644
to go back to the countryside with you, and to raise onions and green onions.

184
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:07,854
That's my goal in life.

185
00:14:08,734 --> 00:14:13,184
I'll do all the farming. I won't let you touch dirt.

186
00:14:13,184 --> 00:14:15,364
But why are you asking me this all of a sudden?

187
00:14:17,164 --> 00:14:23,064
- What if a seed you sowed was a poisonous plant? 
-  What?

188
00:14:23,624 --> 00:14:26,914
What if your cherished plant

189
00:14:26,914 --> 00:14:30,184
grew up to be a poisonous mushroom before you could stop it

190
00:14:30,774 --> 00:14:34,074
and caused all the other plants to die?

191
00:14:34,654 --> 00:14:39,354
I would weed it out before it spread further.

192
00:15:14,004 --> 00:15:15,614
Mom.

193
00:15:16,214 --> 00:15:17,904
You're up.

194
00:15:18,804 --> 00:15:21,044
Did you have a drink?

195
00:15:30,954 --> 00:15:32,984
Who's that man?

196
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:35,594
What are you talking about suddenly?

197
00:15:35,594 --> 00:15:38,224
The man who acts like he's your right hand.

198
00:15:39,114 --> 00:15:41,134
When did it start?

199
00:15:41,614 --> 00:15:43,904
Were you involved...

200
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:46,904
in Mr. Jo's death, too?

201
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,144
Pretend you don't know anything.

202
00:15:50,274 --> 00:15:54,214
I'll make your and Ni Na's wish come true.

203
00:15:54,214 --> 00:15:56,384
No.

204
00:15:56,384 --> 00:15:59,134
Roo Na, listen carefully.

205
00:15:59,134 --> 00:16:03,494
I was behind everything that you've done so far.

206
00:16:04,114 --> 00:16:09,344
- Mom.
 - Everything including evil, dirty, and horrible deeds.

207
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:11,594
You don't know anything about this.

208
00:16:11,594 --> 00:16:16,464
I was the one who plotted and ordered them. Got it?

209
00:16:16,994 --> 00:16:18,524
There's no need.

210
00:16:18,524 --> 00:16:22,364
And... from now on,

211
00:16:23,904 --> 00:16:27,974
you cannot plot anything without telling me first.

212
00:16:30,634 --> 00:16:32,484
Promise me.

213
00:16:35,054 --> 00:16:37,074
I promise.

214
00:16:40,714 --> 00:16:45,874
Don't worry. It's nothing.

215
00:17:09,664 --> 00:17:11,234
   

216
00:17:20,024 --> 00:17:21,514
Are you sleeping?

217
00:17:22,414 --> 00:17:23,984
No.

218
00:17:24,724 --> 00:17:27,004
Should I bring you chamomile tea?

219
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,884
 No. 

220
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:36,344
Yeon Seo,

221
00:17:37,934 --> 00:17:40,544
 I was so upset and heartbroken 

222
00:17:41,764 --> 00:17:44,524
when I decided to send you away to him,

223
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,894
so I thought there was something wrong with me.

224
00:17:50,294 --> 00:17:54,334
I won't send you away to anyone, starting now.

225
00:17:57,934 --> 00:18:00,954
I'm sleepy. Let's go to sleep.

226
00:18:18,104 --> 00:18:19,724
Good night.

227
00:18:32,124 --> 00:18:34,814
 You must listen to this now. 

228
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,524
 How did you find me? 

229
00:18:43,524 --> 00:18:46,574
 Money can do anything. 

230
00:18:46,574 --> 00:18:48,284
I'm going to stay out of this.

231
00:18:48,284 --> 00:18:52,054
But please just wait a bit. Once the show is over—

232
00:18:52,054 --> 00:18:56,454
I'm telling you to be careful. That's what I wanted to tell you.

233
00:18:58,364 --> 00:19:00,064
Miss doesn't know anything.

234
00:19:00,064 --> 00:19:04,894
Since there's no evidence, there won't be any punishment and only Yeon Seo will suffer.

235
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:07,764
So what then?

236
00:19:07,764 --> 00:19:10,414
I plan to give up on everything.

237
00:19:10,414 --> 00:19:15,834
We should call it quits before Miss finds out. Bye.

238
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:35,944
Wh-Why did you do that?

239
00:19:35,944 --> 00:19:40,414
Ji Woong is dead. No, he was murdered.

240
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:57,424
 I need to buy some time. 

241
00:19:57,424 --> 00:19:59,534
 We must go to the police right now. What are you talking about? 

242
00:19:59,534 --> 00:20:02,964
 You were kidnapped and almost fell from a building. 

243
00:20:02,964 --> 00:20:04,734
 There's no evidence. 

244
00:20:04,734 --> 00:20:07,704
 I got cooperation to check the CCTVs, but they were clean. 

245
00:20:07,704 --> 00:20:12,114
 You said all of Mr. Moon's belongings disappeared. A testimony won't be enough to bring charges. 

246
00:20:12,114 --> 00:20:15,314
 We should have a lead for them to reinvestigate. 

247
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:19,054
 Mr. Park has to gather his courage and make up his mind. 

248
00:20:19,054 --> 00:20:21,194
 He must be scared. He went off the grid. 

249
00:20:21,194 --> 00:20:22,354
How did this happen?

250
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:26,024
How do you think they found out that Ji Woong was in Seoul and that he met with us?

251
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:28,254
I got my phone checked by a technician.

252
00:20:28,254 --> 00:20:33,074
Since it wasn't my phone, that only leaves us with your phone. They were wiretapping your phone.

253
00:20:33,074 --> 00:20:37,834
 Luckily, they still believe that Miss doesn't remember that she was kidnapped that day. 

254
00:20:37,834 --> 00:20:39,684
 I'm sure they're wiretapping his phone. 

255
00:20:39,684 --> 00:20:41,394
 Let's use that to our advantage. 

256
00:20:41,394 --> 00:20:42,784
Why are you surprised?

257
00:20:42,784 --> 00:20:47,414
Did you think that you would be safe if you worked with both sides?

258
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:50,144
 Comforting and coaxing a faint-hearted person won't work.  

259
00:20:50,144 --> 00:20:53,834
 We must make him face the harsh reality. 

260
00:20:53,834 --> 00:20:56,574
 He should know that there's no place to hide. 

261
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:04,774
I'm sorry, Miss.

262
00:21:05,774 --> 00:21:07,254
All of a sudden?

263
00:21:07,254 --> 00:21:10,474
That was my chance.

264
00:21:10,474 --> 00:21:16,014
When Seung Hwan scolded me that I would get my hands dirty,

265
00:21:16,014 --> 00:21:18,264
I should have stopped then.

266
00:21:18,264 --> 00:21:23,274
Mr. Jo... knew?

267
00:21:23,274 --> 00:21:25,274
 Yeon Seo, hold tight! 

268
00:21:26,854 --> 00:21:27,814
 If you give me 

269
00:21:27,814 --> 00:21:30,994
  just a little more time, I will bring you back to your place. 

270
00:21:30,994 --> 00:21:34,494
Is that why... you killed him?

271
00:21:34,494 --> 00:21:35,794
No, no. I wasn't behind it.

272
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,724
I only did what I was ordered to do.

273
00:21:37,724 --> 00:21:39,014
I didn't know they would hurt him.

274
00:21:39,014 --> 00:21:40,874
Shut your mouth!

275
00:21:40,874 --> 00:21:44,164
I won't give you time to ask for forgiveness or to give me excuses.

276
00:21:44,164 --> 00:21:48,384
Don't you say a word. Live in the fiery pit for the rest of your life without speaking a word of this.

277
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:53,354
If what happened three years ago wasn't an accident but an incident,

278
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:58,554
I suspected that his car accident probably wasn't a mere accident.

279
00:22:01,414 --> 00:22:03,644
But how?

280
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:07,154
Don't you know what kind of a person he was?

281
00:22:07,154 --> 00:22:12,144
He was good-natured and righteous. How could you hurt someone like him?

282
00:22:14,924 --> 00:22:16,904
Don't use your weakness to become wicked,

283
00:22:16,904 --> 00:22:22,144
and think hard about how you can be forgiven, Mr. Park.

284
00:22:25,394 --> 00:22:27,354
Let's go.

285
00:22:43,524 --> 00:22:45,814
You two can go.

286
00:22:45,814 --> 00:22:49,044
I'll try to convince Mr. Park a little more.

287
00:22:49,044 --> 00:22:50,644
Okay.

288
00:22:54,024 --> 00:22:55,234
Are you okay?

289
00:22:55,234 --> 00:22:57,034
I'm completely fine.

290
00:22:57,034 --> 00:22:59,164
You're lying again.

291
00:22:59,924 --> 00:23:02,014
Let's sit down for a bit.

292
00:23:10,414 --> 00:23:18,484
Hey, Angel. Does the devil really exist?

293
00:23:19,844 --> 00:23:23,534
If angels exist, then it means devils exist, too. Right?

294
00:23:23,534 --> 00:23:27,604
I don't think they're the ones with horns and tails.

295
00:23:28,464 --> 00:23:33,474
I'm a brat and I could be annoying, so I understand that

296
00:23:33,474 --> 00:23:35,974
they would want to kill me.

297
00:23:35,974 --> 00:23:38,354
But not Mr. Jo.

298
00:23:40,714 --> 00:23:43,544
Why must he be sacrificed?

299
00:23:43,544 --> 00:23:48,464
Tell me. If God really exists, how can He do this?

300
00:23:48,464 --> 00:23:54,874
Both humans and angels... can never know what His will is.

301
00:23:57,644 --> 00:24:00,544
That's so boring and cheap.

302
00:24:04,174 --> 00:24:06,344
Can you walk?

303
00:24:08,464 --> 00:24:12,794
I want you to come with me.

304
00:24:38,004 --> 00:24:40,384
What is this? A fountain?

305
00:24:40,384 --> 00:24:42,514
A rainbow.

306
00:24:52,124 --> 00:24:54,124
Wow.

307
00:25:09,324 --> 00:25:11,304
Yeon Seo.

308
00:25:23,904 --> 00:25:25,134
This is...

309
00:25:25,134 --> 00:25:27,094
Open it.

310
00:25:47,914 --> 00:25:52,344
   

311
00:25:53,554 --> 00:25:59,044
Why... do you have this?

312
00:25:59,044 --> 00:26:02,294
I gave this to Seong Woo.

313
00:26:02,954 --> 00:26:04,794
It's me.

314
00:26:05,494 --> 00:26:06,574
What are you talking about?

315
00:26:06,574 --> 00:26:12,124
The kid you met on Yeonwha Island. I'm Yoo Seong Woo.

316
00:26:14,404 --> 00:26:16,724
I didn't know it at first,

317
00:26:16,724 --> 00:26:20,344
but I've kept on having dreams ever since I met you.

318
00:26:20,344 --> 00:26:24,284
I began to remember. Do you remember?

319
00:26:24,284 --> 00:26:28,554
The promise that I made that day when you showed me your rainbow dance.

320
00:26:28,554 --> 00:26:33,164
That you'll become an adult?

321
00:26:33,164 --> 00:26:35,714
That I'd make sure I became an adult.

322
00:26:35,714 --> 00:26:40,884
That after I grew up, I'd protect you.

323
00:26:44,264 --> 00:26:50,334
I think I was sent to you to keep that promise

324
00:26:50,334 --> 00:26:55,114
by that bad God that you despise.

325
00:26:56,024 --> 00:26:59,934
I'll be with you from now on, so don't worry.

326
00:26:59,934 --> 00:27:03,704
I'll protect you so no one will

327
00:27:03,704 --> 00:27:05,914
hurt you.

328
00:27:10,094 --> 00:27:12,524
Are you angry?

329
00:27:14,624 --> 00:27:16,144
Yeon Seo!

330
00:27:16,144 --> 00:27:18,194
Don't follow me.

331
00:27:22,264 --> 00:27:25,094
She is really mad.

332
00:27:32,124 --> 00:27:35,654
I know you're angry, dumbfounded, and shocked.

333
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:39,934
You can hit me as much as want until you feel better.

334
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:51,824
Why... Why are you crying?

335
00:27:52,654 --> 00:27:56,214
I had to say goodbye to him again without realizing

336
00:27:56,214 --> 00:27:59,314
that he was with me.

337
00:28:01,894 --> 00:28:03,654
 I said goodbye to him, 

338
00:28:03,654 --> 00:28:05,184
♫  As if it's a coincidence  ♫

339
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,454
...telling him not to live in pain on the other side.

340
00:28:07,454 --> 00:28:11,354
♫  like a scene of wind  ♫

341
00:28:11,354 --> 00:28:14,864
Until the last moment, when my final moment came,

342
00:28:14,864 --> 00:28:17,174
♫  remember you  ♫

343
00:28:17,174 --> 00:28:18,634
I thought of you.

344
00:28:18,634 --> 00:28:21,954
♫  slowly  ♫

345
00:28:21,954 --> 00:28:25,414
♫  please come to me  ♫

346
00:28:25,414 --> 00:28:26,564
♫  my love  ♫

347
00:28:26,564 --> 00:28:29,054
Don't cry.

348
00:28:29,054 --> 00:28:32,964
I don't want to see you cry because of me.

349
00:28:32,964 --> 00:28:38,584
♫  You never leave my mind  ♫

350
00:28:38,584 --> 00:28:42,114
♫  I was poor at love  ♫

351
00:28:42,114 --> 00:28:47,254
♫  and it was hard for me  ♫

352
00:28:47,254 --> 00:28:52,724
♫  Please blow up to me and stay  ♫

353
00:28:53,534 --> 00:28:57,664
♫  all the times  ♫

354
00:28:57,664 --> 00:28:59,274
♫  to me  ♫

355
00:28:59,274 --> 00:29:04,799
