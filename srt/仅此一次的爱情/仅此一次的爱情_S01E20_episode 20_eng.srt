1
00:00:01,733 --> 00:00:03,003
     

2
00:00:04,633 --> 00:00:12,533


3
00:00:14,033 --> 00:00:15,973
I need to talk to you.

4
00:00:21,553 --> 00:00:24,743
How can you come all the way here?

5
00:00:24,743 --> 00:00:27,423
Where is your handkerchief?

6
00:00:27,423 --> 00:00:30,783
It's mine, so I'll manage that.

7
00:00:33,503 --> 00:00:35,863
There's no use in threatening me. I already made my decision.

8
00:00:35,863 --> 00:00:38,593
No, you need to turn back. Ji Kang Woo is...

9
00:00:38,593 --> 00:00:41,363
You already know. He only wants her because she looks like his first love.

10
00:00:41,363 --> 00:00:43,373
He was sincere!

11
00:00:44,513 --> 00:00:47,613
He sincerely loves Lee Yeon Seo.

12
00:00:51,463 --> 00:00:53,263
That can't be possible.

13
00:00:53,263 --> 00:00:57,503
Your mission is halfway to success. You just have to leave now.

14
00:00:58,743 --> 00:01:01,103
If you're here to tell me that, just go.

15
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:06,623
So, what if you tell Noisy Gong your story. Then what?  Then what!

16
00:01:06,623 --> 00:01:09,783
Then, are you going to show her how you turn into dust?

17
00:01:25,993 --> 00:01:29,513
The only thing you can do for her is to leave

18
00:01:29,513 --> 00:01:33,233
before she loves you even more. Before she gets hurt even more,

19
00:01:33,233 --> 00:01:35,983
before something more frightening happens.

20
00:01:35,983 --> 00:01:41,113
Ji Kang Woo can be there by Noisy Gong's side. You and I can return to paradise.

21
00:01:41,113 --> 00:01:45,403
It'll be a happy ending for everyone.

22
00:01:45,403 --> 00:01:47,413
Isn't that right, Dan?

23
00:01:50,463 --> 00:01:53,773
I'm sure that there is a way.

24
00:01:53,773 --> 00:01:57,863
If a human became an angel, then there should be a way for an angel to become a human.

25
00:01:57,863 --> 00:01:59,903
Don't say useless things!

26
00:01:59,903 --> 00:02:03,143
Think it through. If you act rashly, something bad will happen.

27
00:02:03,143 --> 00:02:05,833
Stop trying to scare me!

28
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:11,243
I'll deal with the bad thing and get struck by lightning if I must. Just leave.

29
00:02:11,243 --> 00:02:13,233
Da—

30
00:02:21,353 --> 00:02:24,123
Relax.

31
00:02:24,123 --> 00:02:29,393
You're the one dancing. Why am I more nervous? Do well, Noisy Gong.

32
00:02:29,393 --> 00:02:31,203
Again!

33
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:37,033
My Noisy Gong, the prettiest in the whole world.

34
00:02:37,973 --> 00:02:39,603
Here.

35
00:02:46,413 --> 00:02:50,323
It proves that you are an angel, and it connects this land with paradise.

36
00:02:50,323 --> 00:02:53,743
Do not lose it.

37
00:02:53,743 --> 00:02:57,493
Make sure you always carry it around.

38
00:02:57,493 --> 00:03:01,453
May I borrow that until today? I want it as my good luck charm.

39
00:03:12,033 --> 00:03:15,823
This is yours now.

40
00:03:15,823 --> 00:03:18,593
You're giving it to me for good?

41
00:03:18,593 --> 00:03:22,793
I don't need it since I'll be with you.

42
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:29,663


43
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:47,293
Your vote today will determine the future of Fantasia.

44
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:52,043
I believe that you will vote for a dancer who touches your heart.

45
00:04:16,303 --> 00:04:19,093
Did Geum Ni Na not come?

46
00:04:23,253 --> 00:04:26,453
Good luck, everyone. San Ha, control your emotions.

47
00:04:26,453 --> 00:04:27,883
Soo Ji, get bolder.

48
00:04:27,883 --> 00:04:31,213
Jung Eun, maintain your balance. And Yeon Seo...

49
00:04:35,023 --> 00:04:37,723
focus on your interpretation.

50
00:04:37,723 --> 00:04:42,693
Whoever it may be, I'm going to do my best to use your interpretation.

51
00:04:42,693 --> 00:04:47,833
So do your best to convince them, so that the corps and I will be able to follow.

52
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,243
Give up.

53
00:05:09,793 --> 00:05:13,523
You overworked yourself after giving birth, didn't you? It seems like there's an inflammation in your pelvis.

54
00:05:13,523 --> 00:05:15,463
Did you go to the hospital?

55
00:05:15,463 --> 00:05:19,763
What is it? Are you desperate to get my vote now?

56
00:05:19,763 --> 00:05:21,553
I was never considered a rival to you anyway. Is that it?

57
00:05:21,553 --> 00:05:24,053
Are you going to stop being a ballerina?

58
00:05:24,053 --> 00:05:26,713
Did you go through all that and make a comeback just for this?

59
00:05:26,713 --> 00:05:30,833
Give up on this audition and focus on getting better first.

60
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:35,033
No, I can't do that. I won't give up twice.

61
00:05:35,033 --> 00:05:38,923
If I give up, it'll be too difficult to return.

62
00:05:39,963 --> 00:05:42,293
I'm sure you, of all people, would know.

63
00:05:42,293 --> 00:05:47,763
I may be nothing in your eyes, but I am still a ballerina. Do you know that?

64
00:05:54,383 --> 00:05:56,893
Starting now, the audition will begin.

65
00:05:56,893 --> 00:06:00,583
The candidates were allowed to choose any scenes from "Giselle."

66
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:04,223
The first candidate is Lee San Ha.

67
00:06:14,023 --> 00:06:17,933
 If we win over thirty members of the corps and thirteen from our side, will that make us safe? 

68
00:06:17,933 --> 00:06:20,903
Since the voting will be done in secret, we won't be able to track them.

69
00:06:20,903 --> 00:06:24,623
We can't be sure. I don't like this idea.

70
00:06:26,613 --> 00:06:29,023
 If we meet them in person, it'll only leave traces. 

71
00:06:29,023 --> 00:06:33,783
 I know that.  But there's no other way.

72
00:06:33,783 --> 00:06:37,213
Yeon Seo is second to none when it comes to performing ballet.

73
00:06:37,213 --> 00:06:41,393
She's aware of that, and that's why she has put everything on the line.

74
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:48,353
 I'm sure the corps will give back for what they've received. 

75
00:06:48,353 --> 00:06:50,303
 Ni Na should do well. 

76
00:06:50,303 --> 00:06:52,723
 As an artist, I'm sure she has her pride. 

77
00:06:52,723 --> 00:06:56,163
 They need money after all. In life, 

78
00:06:56,163 --> 00:06:59,823
 money is the most important. 

79
00:07:07,823 --> 00:07:11,583
The next candidate is Geum Ni Na.

80
00:07:31,433 --> 00:07:34,623
Geum Ni Na is here now.

81
00:07:36,803 --> 00:07:40,793
Wow, Ms. Ni Na's vibe totally changed.

82
00:07:51,743 --> 00:07:57,903
 Stop! What is this disgusting emotion? 

83
00:07:57,903 --> 00:08:02,673
 I can't stop myself. What use is all this? 

84
00:08:02,673 --> 00:08:05,153
 It has to be Yeon Seo. I am not enough 

85
00:08:05,153 --> 00:08:07,883
 as long as I can't be Lee Yeon Seo. 

86
00:08:07,883 --> 00:08:10,013
 I won't do no matter how hard I try. 

87
00:08:10,013 --> 00:08:14,383
 This was your fate from the beginning. 

88
00:08:14,383 --> 00:08:16,933
 You're like an item on display that nobody wants, no matter how pretty you are. 

89
00:08:16,933 --> 00:08:21,513
 Unless you're Yeon Seo, you have no choice but to be locked up behind glass doors. 

90
00:08:21,513 --> 00:08:25,443
 Forget it! Why do you even bother to try? 

91
00:08:32,953 --> 00:08:38,393
 1,124. 1,125. 1,12- 

92
00:08:42,693 --> 00:08:45,023
 That's good enough now. 

93
00:09:49,033 --> 00:09:50,793
Bravo!

94
00:09:50,793 --> 00:09:52,623
Woo!

95
00:10:17,853 --> 00:10:22,073
That was incredible. You really did well.

96
00:10:22,073 --> 00:10:26,503
Don't evaluate me. I didn't do that to gain your approval.

97
00:10:26,503 --> 00:10:28,533
Do well yourself.

98
00:10:30,813 --> 00:10:34,373
 The next candidate is Lee Yeon Seo. 

99
00:11:33,603 --> 00:11:35,803
 She feels resentment. 

100
00:11:35,803 --> 00:11:39,853
 Not towards him, but towards herself. 

101
00:11:40,563 --> 00:11:43,083
 Was my love not enough? 

102
00:11:44,593 --> 00:11:49,343
♫  And it made long-lost warmth returned to me  ♫

103
00:11:49,343 --> 00:11:51,453
♫  like a miracle  ♫

104
00:11:51,453 --> 00:11:53,553
  It's not like that.  

105
00:11:55,053 --> 00:11:59,473
 He probably couldn't tell me because he had no trust in me. 

106
00:12:00,443 --> 00:12:05,583
  That's not true, I want to tell you. Especially you.  

107
00:12:06,473 --> 00:12:10,613
 I want to tell you who and what I am. 

108
00:12:11,353 --> 00:12:14,773
  But, can I do that?  

109
00:12:17,313 --> 00:12:22,083
♫  After a long waiting  ♫

110
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:27,473
♫  and emotional suffering,  ♫

111
00:12:27,473 --> 00:12:32,433
♫  rain comes down on me quietly  ♫

112
00:12:32,433 --> 00:12:36,813
♫  and its tears make me soaked  ♫

113
00:12:36,813 --> 00:12:41,553
♫   Our memories stopped   ♫

114
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:47,223
♫  at the end of the season  ♫

115
00:12:47,223 --> 00:12:52,653
♫  They shine in my heart  ♫

116
00:12:52,653 --> 00:13:01,273
♫   brilliantly like a gleaming shining light  ♫

117
00:13:15,793 --> 00:13:20,553
♫   Our memories stopped   ♫

118
00:13:20,553 --> 00:13:26,293
♫  at the end of the season  ♫

119
00:13:26,293 --> 00:13:34,493
♫  they shine in my heart  ♫

120
00:13:38,393 --> 00:13:45,113
♫   brilliantly like a gleaming shining light  ♫

121
00:13:50,643 --> 00:13:58,283


122
00:14:07,243 --> 00:14:09,303
 We'll begin the tally. 

123
00:14:11,963 --> 00:14:14,383
     

124
00:14:20,663 --> 00:14:22,723
The last vote goes to...

125
00:14:34,683 --> 00:14:36,783
Lee Yeon Seo.

126
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,633
Since it's tied,

127
00:14:45,633 --> 00:14:48,853
we can either have a final match or a head-to-head vote.

128
00:14:48,853 --> 00:14:52,323
But why are there only 29 votes?

129
00:14:54,673 --> 00:14:57,393
Did one of you abstain?

130
00:14:57,393 --> 00:14:59,313
Where did Ms. Hwang Jung Eun go?

131
00:14:59,313 --> 00:15:03,013
She said she had something urgent and left earlier.

132
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,223
It looks like she didn't vote.

133
00:15:05,223 --> 00:15:09,433
Let's call her and ask. She left in a hurry, but she saw the performances.

134
00:15:09,433 --> 00:15:11,173
And I bet she has no idea about the tie.

135
00:15:11,173 --> 00:15:15,053
We can just call her and ask her for whom she wants to vote.

136
00:15:15,053 --> 00:15:19,253
Including the candidates and voters, if anyone is against this idea,

137
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:22,053
we'll push forward with a head-to-head vote.

138
00:15:25,393 --> 00:15:28,863
None, right? You know that Korea is known for its competitiveness.

139
00:15:28,863 --> 00:15:31,863
We can't end the audition without a clear winner.

140
00:15:31,863 --> 00:15:34,333
Go ahead and call her.

141
00:15:41,943 --> 00:15:44,273
     

142
00:15:48,503 --> 00:15:49,823
Hello.

143
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:53,723
Ms. Jeong Eun, you saw all of it, right? I won't talk long.
      

144
00:15:53,723 --> 00:15:56,083
You'll vote on the phone.

145
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:59,173
 Among the five candidates, cast your vote. 

146
00:15:59,173 --> 00:16:02,213
- Right now, like this? 
 - Yes.

147
00:16:02,213 --> 00:16:06,433
We're all listening to this phone call right now. But if it's burdensome, you don't have to do it.

148
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:09,793
This is supposed to be anonymous, but everyone will find out whom you voted for.

149
00:16:09,793 --> 00:16:12,463
- If you want to abstain... 
  - No, I'll do it. 

150
00:16:12,463 --> 00:16:15,673
If you'll acknowledge it, then I'll vote.

151
00:16:19,113 --> 00:16:20,743
I...

152
00:16:27,443 --> 00:16:30,423
 liked Lee Yeon Seo's performance the most. 

153
00:16:38,523 --> 00:16:42,023
2019 Fantasia's Giselle is...

154
00:16:43,213 --> 00:16:45,293
Lee Yeon Seo.

155
00:17:19,533 --> 00:17:23,423
Let's accept it. The dancers who will dance with her voted for her.

156
00:17:23,423 --> 00:17:26,723
Everyone will agree that it was fair.

157
00:17:27,993 --> 00:17:30,593
What have you done for Fantasia?

158
00:17:30,593 --> 00:17:33,433
What have you done for Ni Na's audition?

159
00:17:33,433 --> 00:17:35,273
Art?

160
00:17:35,853 --> 00:17:40,173
My foot.

161
00:17:40,173 --> 00:17:44,283
They dared to backstab me after accepting all those bribes from me?

162
00:17:44,283 --> 00:17:46,473
What do you mean?

163
00:17:46,963 --> 00:17:48,713
Did you bribe them?

164
00:17:48,713 --> 00:17:51,643
Stop! Stop! If we let the performance go on stage,

165
00:17:51,643 --> 00:17:54,423
this is the end. End!

166
00:17:54,423 --> 00:17:56,343
No. I can't let this be.

167
00:17:56,343 --> 00:18:01,003
Then, what choice do we have? Should Yeon Seo go blind again for Ni Na to...

168
00:18:03,763 --> 00:18:08,673
Right. I just need to make sure, at all costs, that she never performs.

169
00:18:08,673 --> 00:18:11,093
Yeong Ja, come to your senses.

170
00:18:11,093 --> 00:18:15,713
We've been too kind to her since she is our family.

171
00:18:16,713 --> 00:18:18,303
Right?

172
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:28,283
Ni Na! Ni Na, where are you?

173
00:18:41,973 --> 00:18:44,713
I wish she were dead.

174
00:18:46,213 --> 00:18:52,173
I wish Lee Yeon Seo were dead.

175
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:57,873
  Ms. Yeon Seo, can you change your pose please.  

176
00:18:57,873 --> 00:19:00,033
 We'll take another shot of your face. 

177
00:19:00,033 --> 00:19:03,043
 How will your "Swan Lake" of 2016 be different from other shows? 

178
00:19:03,043 --> 00:19:05,283
 I'll show you the visible difference between good and evil. 

179
00:19:05,283 --> 00:19:07,793
 Can we expect to see the best "Swan Lake" of the year? 

180
00:19:07,793 --> 00:19:11,753
 Of course. I'll show you the perfect thirty-two turns. 

181
00:19:15,023 --> 00:19:19,723
 If Yeon Seo weren't here... If she weren't here... 

182
00:19:19,723 --> 00:19:23,073
 I would be the lead dancer. 

183
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:44,993
Congratulations.

184
00:19:44,993 --> 00:19:46,793
Thank you.

185
00:19:46,793 --> 00:19:49,353
I convinced you, too. Right?

186
00:19:49,353 --> 00:19:51,643
Shall we have dinner together later?

187
00:19:51,643 --> 00:19:53,473
- What? 
 - I contemplated it a lot,

188
00:19:53,473 --> 00:19:56,323
but I have to tell you

189
00:19:56,323 --> 00:20:00,813
why I chose you and what happened to me.

190
00:20:02,893 --> 00:20:04,143
I have prior plans.

191
00:20:04,143 --> 00:20:05,213
I'll wait until you come.

192
00:20:05,213 --> 00:20:06,503
Please don't wait.

193
00:20:06,503 --> 00:20:11,803
If it's about work, we can do it in the studio. If it's a private matter, I won't listen to you.

194
00:20:11,803 --> 00:20:13,533
You don't know anything

195
00:20:13,533 --> 00:20:18,043
about the feeling I have as I stand in front of you.

196
00:20:19,483 --> 00:20:21,743
I respect you and I'm grateful to you.

197
00:20:21,743 --> 00:20:24,883
It's fun to work with you and I'm looking forward to our collaboration.

198
00:20:24,883 --> 00:20:27,873
Please don't make these feelings become uncomfortable.

199
00:20:27,873 --> 00:20:29,563
You can be the judge of that after you hear me out.

200
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:33,983
You know the restaurant in front of the ballet theatre. Meet me there after your appointment.

201
00:20:46,753 --> 00:20:49,183
Lee Yeon Seo! Lee Yeon Seo!

202
00:20:50,053 --> 00:20:51,543
Someone might see.

203
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:54,713
Congratulations, you did really well! You were beautiful.

204
00:20:54,713 --> 00:20:56,293
What about the present?

205
00:20:56,293 --> 00:20:57,253
Huh?

206
00:20:57,253 --> 00:21:00,363
What? You didn't prepare anything?

207
00:21:01,273 --> 00:21:04,033
Instead of a present, come with me somewhere.

208
00:21:04,033 --> 00:21:05,603
I have to meet Ms. Jeong.

209
00:21:05,603 --> 00:21:07,603
Before that, just a moment.

210
00:21:07,603 --> 00:21:10,723
- Where to? 
 - To where we first met.

211
00:21:10,723 --> 00:21:12,983
There's something I really have to tell you.

212
00:21:12,983 --> 00:21:19,663
Who I am, where I came from. I'll tell you everything from the beginning.

213
00:21:28,793 --> 00:21:29,873
I'll have coffee first.

214
00:21:29,873 --> 00:21:31,793
I'll order the meal when my companion arrives.

215
00:21:31,793 --> 00:21:33,483
  Yes.  

216
00:21:49,943 --> 00:21:52,663
We still have time.

217
00:21:52,663 --> 00:21:55,243
No, it's not that.

218
00:21:56,823 --> 00:21:59,653
The director...

219
00:21:59,653 --> 00:22:02,863
What about him? Did he say something about your dance?

220
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:06,783
Or did he say something weird? Or something like that?

221
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:10,323
He said he has something to say, that he'll wait until I go there.

222
00:22:10,323 --> 00:22:15,623
I did tell him that I wouldn't go, but it's bothering me.

223
00:22:16,493 --> 00:22:19,693
That man is unbelievable. He had his nose high in the air.

224
00:22:19,693 --> 00:22:21,453
He told you he'll wait for you?

225
00:22:21,453 --> 00:22:24,853
Neither think about him nor accept him.

226
00:22:28,873 --> 00:22:32,063
Are you jealous?

227
00:22:32,063 --> 00:22:32,933
What?

228
00:22:32,933 --> 00:22:34,413
That just now.

229
00:22:34,413 --> 00:22:36,103
No...

230
00:22:39,053 --> 00:22:40,193
Oh, fine! Yes, I am!

231
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:46,413
If this petty, embarrassing, and nasty feeling is called jealousy.

232
00:22:50,043 --> 00:22:51,453
I hate Ji Kang Woo.

233
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:55,033
I hate that he's clinging onto you,

234
00:22:55,033 --> 00:22:56,483
and I hate that he meets with you separately!

235
00:22:56,483 --> 00:23:02,193
So don't meet him unless I'm with you from now on.

236
00:23:16,203 --> 00:23:18,833
Do you like me that much?

237
00:23:23,323 --> 00:23:25,203
Yeah.

238
00:23:34,343 --> 00:23:36,133
Let's go.

239
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:57,723
Do you have some issue with rain?

240
00:23:58,753 --> 00:24:03,053
- Why? 
 - Now that I think about it. You only run away whenever it rains.

241
00:24:03,053 --> 00:24:04,963
Right?

242
00:24:05,863 --> 00:24:08,723
Do you have some kind of trauma? Or an allergy?

243
00:24:08,723 --> 00:24:13,183
Or do you transform in an instant?

244
00:24:15,893 --> 00:24:19,233
If I actually do, what would you think of it...

245
00:24:19,873 --> 00:24:25,453
if I become something other than what I am right now?

246
00:24:31,483 --> 00:24:34,403
I would pray for you to come back to yourself.

247
00:24:42,423 --> 00:24:45,343
I should buy an umbrella. Wait here.

248
00:24:45,343 --> 00:24:47,363
Let's go together.

249
00:24:54,163 --> 00:24:58,283
I'm not going to run away anymore. I'll be right back.

250
00:25:17,093 --> 00:25:19,383
Have lots of sales.

251
00:25:25,243 --> 00:25:27,243
Excuse me.

252
00:25:34,193 --> 00:25:36,403
 I get a strange feeling 

253
00:25:36,403 --> 00:25:42,363
 I will search everywhere for him in the distant future. 

254
00:25:42,363 --> 00:25:46,213
 It felt like I would be left alone in sadness and despair, longing for him. 

255
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:51,553
 A feeling as if all I would ever do is deeply miss him. 

256
00:25:51,553 --> 00:25:53,963
  Lee Yeon Seo!  

257
00:26:09,153 --> 00:26:11,033
Be careful.

258
00:26:27,073 --> 00:26:31,083
     

259
00:26:57,753 --> 00:27:00,863
     

260
00:27:04,163 --> 00:27:08,883
 "Director Ji, I'm sorry. It's too burdensome, I don't have the confidence." 

261
00:27:08,883 --> 00:27:10,683
  "I guess this is as far as I'll go."  

262
00:27:10,683 --> 00:27:15,533
  "I'm ending it all at the ballet theatre I loved." 

263
00:27:32,123 --> 00:27:35,873
Where am I?

264
00:27:35,873 --> 00:27:40,753
I hear cars and a ventilator?

265
00:27:46,393 --> 00:27:49,303
     

266
00:27:58,523 --> 00:28:00,383
Yes, everything is ready.

267
00:28:00,383 --> 00:28:02,953
I sent him an invitation, so he will be there soon.

268
00:28:02,953 --> 00:28:08,833
We need to let him see the final moment of the ballerina whom he adored.

269
00:28:09,583 --> 00:28:16,093
A hypersensitive ballerina who believes in conspiracy theories because of paranoia

270
00:28:16,093 --> 00:28:19,623
kills herself with the stress of her comeback.

271
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:24,783
It's a nice headline. Make sure you end this well.

272
00:28:29,973 --> 00:28:31,863
  The recipient is currently unavailable.  

273
00:28:31,863 --> 00:28:34,013
  Leave a message at—  

274
00:28:45,633 --> 00:28:46,863
Is this 911?

275
00:28:46,863 --> 00:28:51,383
There's a person at the roof of the building. I think they're going to fall, hurry!

276
00:28:58,913 --> 00:29:00,583
Who are you?

277
00:29:00,583 --> 00:29:03,183
Who sent you? Aunt?

278
00:29:03,183 --> 00:29:04,353
Did Aunt send you?

279
00:29:04,353 --> 00:29:08,523
Think whatever you want. This is the end for you anyway.

280
00:29:08,523 --> 00:29:11,513
This is the rooftop of the ballet theatre, isn't it?

281
00:29:11,513 --> 00:29:17,333
Think about this again. There are so many CCTVs here. You'll definitely get caught.

282
00:29:18,743 --> 00:29:20,823
You can just leave right now.

283
00:29:20,823 --> 00:29:23,923
You don't have to take off the blindfold or untie my hands.

284
00:29:23,923 --> 00:29:27,193
I'll consider it that this never happened. I'll never look for you.

285
00:29:39,543 --> 00:29:42,563
You made the right decision.

286
00:29:42,563 --> 00:29:46,523
Leave. I didn't see you.

287
00:30:02,723 --> 00:30:04,903
Thank you, for saving me.

288
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:07,133
I'm not saving you.

289
00:30:08,613 --> 00:30:14,273
No one commits suicide with their hands tied and eyes covered.

290
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:32,923
 Dan! 

291
00:30:32,923 --> 00:30:41,483
  ♫ Woo Woo just stay, please stay by my side ♫  

292
00:30:43,083 --> 00:30:45,273
  ♫ I'm here ♫  

293
00:30:46,993 --> 00:30:56,193
  ♫ Woo Woo I'll stay, I’ll stay by your side ♫  

294
00:30:57,693 --> 00:31:01,603
  ♫ Always Oh ♫  

295
00:31:01,603 --> 00:31:11,233
 ♫ Woo Woo just stay, please stay with me ♫ 

296
00:31:12,443 --> 00:31:14,973
 ♫ I'm here ♫ 

297
00:31:16,323 --> 00:31:18,033
  ♫ Woo Woo ♫  

298
00:31:18,033 --> 00:31:22,063
    

299
00:31:22,063 --> 00:31:25,253
 You can't hurt Yeon Seo again, 

300
00:31:25,253 --> 00:31:26,783
 as long as I'm around. 

301
00:31:26,783 --> 00:31:28,523
 You lost consciousness. You need to rest. 

302
00:31:28,523 --> 00:31:30,033
 Give it back to me. 

303
00:31:30,033 --> 00:31:32,353
 Something is going on. 

304
00:31:32,353 --> 00:31:36,653
 Definitely. I'm going to find the reason. 

305
00:31:36,653 --> 00:31:39,453
 It was you. 

306
00:31:39,453 --> 00:31:43,463
 You don't really like me? 

307
00:31:43,463 --> 00:31:46,023
 You messed around with her memory? 

308
00:31:46,023 --> 00:31:48,793
 Keep your eyes on her when I'm not around her.  

309
00:31:48,793 --> 00:31:54,099
