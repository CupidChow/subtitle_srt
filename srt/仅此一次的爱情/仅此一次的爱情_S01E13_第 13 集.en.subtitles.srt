1
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,021
What's wrong?

2
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:04,689
Did you cry?

3
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,952
Why? What's wrong?

4
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,165
Nothing.

5
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:24,542
I just

6
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:27,837
missed you

7
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,632
so much.

8
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:35,804
Me too.

9
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,389
I missed you too.

10
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:48,650
I wish to be a human.

11
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:51,694
Is this

12
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:54,197
possible?

13
00:01:56,825 --> 00:02:01,579
REPORT

14
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:12,841
Like dust

15
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:14,467
and powder...

16
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:16,344
He will disappear.

17
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,640
-Why?
-The deity is very jealous.

18
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,852
He doesn't want what's His
to be taken away.

19
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,019
Kim Dan

20
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:27,897
will dissipate

21
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,024
because of your love.

22
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:33,069
You're lying.

23
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:34,571
Stop lying.

24
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:35,905
You don't want to believe it.

25
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,867
I know what that feels like.

26
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,036
How do you know?

27
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,206
I know you're trying to scare me
with your lie to break us up.

28
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,503
I can go to the church and check.

29
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,839
I'll ask his senior.
He'll tell me for sure.

30
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,144
Do you get it now?

31
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,730
This is why I know so much

32
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:10,899
about Kim Dan.

33
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:35,924
What are you going to do?

34
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,550
None of your business.

35
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,178
Are you going to destroy her
because you can't have her?

36
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:42,472
Whatever floats your boat.

37
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,640
You said you want to live.

38
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,726
But if you destroy the very thing that
makes you want to live, you will die too.

39
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,355
I'm doing this to live.

40
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,315
I had no idea.

41
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,234
If I had known,

42
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:57,320
if anyone had told me, I would have never

43
00:03:58,696 --> 00:03:59,864
gone to the church

44
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,908
with Seol-hui.

45
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,370
If I had to abandon the deity,
I would have done it alone!

46
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:09,832
You wish to protect

47
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,668
Lee Yeon-seo.

48
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,670
Just like

49
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:16,756
how you are trying to protect Kim Dan.

50
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,127
It was all for you.

51
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:59,257
But if you abandon me,

52
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:02,510
-what am I to do?
-Don't make excuses!

53
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,806
Don't use me as your excuse.

54
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:09,517
You're just doing this because you
don't want to give up on Fantasia!

55
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,893
So why are you using me?

56
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,562
It's all because of your greed!

57
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:15,690
Can you say

58
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,151
that I'm wrong?

59
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,862
You shouldn't have done that.

60
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:25,158
If you really cared for me,
you wouldn't have done that.

61
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,162
You want me to be kind?

62
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,581
Because it'll all come back to me?

63
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:32,665
Ni-na.

64
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,918
If it's all because of me, I'll disappear.

65
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:37,795
That will fix everything.

66
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,308
Ni-na.

67
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,813
Mom told me. Yeon-seo was here, right?

68
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:00,651
Ru-na, tell me you didn't know.

69
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,321
Tell me you didn't know about the things

70
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,324
Mom and Dad did.

71
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:09,035
Let's go inside, okay?

72
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:13,206
When did I ask any of you
to kill people for me?

73
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,166
How could you do something so horrible?

74
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:18,211
Are you sure you didn't?

75
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,006
What do you mean?

76
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:23,966
When Yeon-seo returned,

77
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,886
did you really never wish
that she was dead?

78
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,848
You were happy when she lost her sight.

79
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:32,892
Am I wrong?

80
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,355
-That was because--
-Look into your heart.

81
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:41,901
You're only where you are right now
because of what happened to her.

82
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,404
Everything we did was done
so that we can give you what you want.

83
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:50,034
So don't cause a fuss and come inside.

84
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:02,839
LEE YEON-SEO, YOO SEONG-U

85
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,932
The desperate shall find a way.

86
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:14,308
There must

87
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,436
be another way.

88
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:25,319
Who is it?

89
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,114
Is it you, Yeon-seo?

90
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:38,082
I couldn't fall asleep.

91
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,090
Were you busy?

92
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,009
What?

93
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,469
Well...

94
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,305
I was studying.

95
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,765
-I can leave if you're busy.
-No.

96
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:56,309
Come in.

97
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:57,560
Come on in.

98
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:00,938
Let's see...

99
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,192
Do you want to lie down?

100
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,694
Is it too awkward? What should I do?

101
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:08,779
Should I change the blankets?

102
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,116
Wait. What I meant was...

103
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:16,078
Don't mind me
and continue what you were doing.

104
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,706
Okay. All right.

105
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:20,833
Okay.

106
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,200
Dan.

107
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:58,496
Come here.

108
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,459
I want to touch you.

109
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,094
What is it? Am I that fascinating?

110
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:16,097
You're so warm.

111
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,853
Your heart

112
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,023
is beating.

113
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,067
Kim Dan

114
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:29,986
will dissipate

115
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,862
because of your love.

116
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:35,283
He will really disappear?

117
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,078
I look like a human on the outside.

118
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,956
But since I'm not completely human,
my wings pop out,

119
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,958
and my wounds heal on their own.

120
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:48,421
But other than those things,
I'm just like any other man.

121
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,215
I run out of breath and sweat.

122
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,231
Thanks.

123
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,901
Thanks for showing me

124
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,071
your weak side.

125
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,659
You may pretend to be strong and unfazed,

126
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,413
but I know you're weak at heart.

127
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,628
Everything will turn out all right.

128
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:32,465
Tomorrow's board meeting,
your performance for Giselle,

129
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,009
and

130
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:36,802
us.

131
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:42,391
Okay.

132
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,036
Thank you for coming out
on such short notice.

133
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,207
I have an important announcement to make.

134
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,584
From today on, General Director Choi,

135
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,002
Associate Director Keum,

136
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,671
and Chairman Keum will be dismissed.

137
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,717
"Dismissed"?

138
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,177
What is the reason?

139
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:21,013
Why is their entire family
being dismissed?

140
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,445
Yeon-seo.

141
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:40,282
Please allow me to say my last goodbye.

142
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,893
Hello, I'm Choi Yeong-ja.

143
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,395
Up until today,

144
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:12,898
I've given my all to make Fantasia better.

145
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:16,986
I may have been unskilled
and lacking in many ways,

146
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,696
but I can confidently tell you

147
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,240
that the passion I had
for the past ten years was genuine.

148
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:25,953
I am forever grateful
for your generous support

149
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,205
during the past--

150
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,471
What is this?

151
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:44,555
No way.

152
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,348
What is this?

153
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,601
"Chairman Keum Ki-chun Confesses

154
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,687
to Preventing
Lee Yeon-seo's Cornea Transplant"?

155
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:56,901
Who did...

156
00:12:58,694 --> 00:12:59,820
What?

157
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:16,545
-This is ridiculous.
-It's unbelievable.

158
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,548
-He really did that?
-My goodness.

159
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,635
I was the one who gave such orders.

160
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:25,137
Yeon-seo couldn't
receive a cornea transplant sooner,

161
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,556
and her secretary died

162
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,559
all because of me.

163
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:32,520
I will take full responsibility for this.

164
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:36,607
-Wait a minute.
-Please explain, sir.

165
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,526
-Sir!
-Please wait!

166
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,277
"Chairman of Fantasia Prevented

167
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,571
the Cornea Transplant and Abetted Murder"?

168
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,657
What will happen
to our ballet theater then?

169
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,492
We won't get disbanded, will we?

170
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,744
That should never happen.

171
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,038
Don't worry.

172
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:55,918
You must all be shocked.

173
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,379
I tried to keep it on the down low,

174
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:00,047
but it blew up.

175
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:03,551
Everything's just returning to how
they were before,

176
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,344
so please don't worry and be patient.

177
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,138
Fantasia won't disappear
just because of this.

178
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,640
You have my word.

179
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,809
What if the sponsors back out?

180
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,061
What if they want a refund
for the upcoming performance

181
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:15,187
because of the scandal?

182
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,523
Let's not worry about things
that haven't even occurred yet.

183
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,442
My performances were always
the best so far.

184
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,822
You should all go home for today.

185
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,907
We'll start practicing again
once everything settles down.

186
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:35,457
Your corps seemed very agitated.

187
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,085
This was exactly why I tried
to keep it a secret.

188
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,850
Yeon-seo, can we talk?

189
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:20,961
I'm sorry.

190
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,255
What are you trying to pull here?

191
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:26,216
Whether it was an order or a favor,
I shouldn't have done it.

192
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,552
I shouldn't have done what I did.

193
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,430
But before I could even realize,
I found myself on this side.

194
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:33,933
I really regret it.

195
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,559
I'm sorry, Yeon-seo.

196
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,689
What can I do to make up for this?

197
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,692
I'll die in front of you
if that's what you want.

198
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,781
Please forgive my family.

199
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,784
You'll only be at peace
when you forgive us.

200
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,286
I see. That's what you wanted.

201
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,122
If that's why you wanted to talk,
I have nothing else to say.

202
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,124
-Yeon-seo.
-You've got the wrong person.

203
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,294
Who am I to forgive you guys?

204
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,547
It was Mr. Cho
who died on that bridge, not me.

205
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,300
It was Mr. Moon who was murdered

206
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,636
when he came to help
after gathering his courage.

207
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,848
Those people are dead.

208
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,687
I can't ask them for forgiveness
even if I want to.

209
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,563
So I'm asking you.

210
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,484
Uncle was behind everything?

211
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,569
You had no choice but to help him?

212
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,990
Stop putting on an act.
I know you were behind everything.

213
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,090
It's over for my family.

214
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:51,260
My family has fallen apart.

215
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,804
Let's wrap it up here.

216
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,224
What can you gain after sending a man
in his 60s to prison?

217
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,518
He's getting punished for the crimes
he committed.

218
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:00,978
Don't put that on me.

219
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,230
You know, offenders always complain

220
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:06,483
why the victims don't forgive them when
they are about to pay for what they did.

221
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,861
They act like they're the victims.

222
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:12,906
Ru-na.

223
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,742
I hope you'll be investigated thoroughly.

224
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,452
I won't settle or be lenient.

225
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,584
It was probably because of Ni-na, right?

226
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,502
Because she was your sister.

227
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,504
Because you love her.

228
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,926
But Ru-na,

229
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,012
I'm your cousin.

230
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,347
I'm your family too.

231
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,767
Family isn't that important.

232
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:42,936
We are just a community
that was formed by coincidence.

233
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,529
It's fun now that you know everything.

234
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,158
Go ahead with everything
you're planning to do from now on.

235
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:57,743
That way,

236
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,828
it will excite me even more.

237
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:06,752
Watch your back.

238
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,528
Are you still dreaming?

239
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,614
Dreaming of becoming a human?

240
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:38,659
Don't worry.

241
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,911
I will never let Yeon-seo be sacrificed.

242
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:42,955
I'm glad you understood me.

243
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,082
It's wise to give up.

244
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,544
I didn't give up yet.

245
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:52,548
I'm sure that the deity has a plan
for me and Yeon-seo.

246
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,299
And I'll figure it out.

247
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:56,802
And

248
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,972
I must have crossed paths with you

249
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,431
for a reason.

250
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,018
-What do you mean?
-I'm saying that our meeting

251
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,521
was also the deity's providence.

252
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:25,998
-What are you all doing?
-We need to practice.

253
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,583
What are we going to do at home?

254
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,710
When we rest, our bodies
are going to feel stiff.

255
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:33,839
You said you were going to direct us
for the Wilis scene today.

256
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,883
You said you would make us the best.

257
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,593
I want to be the best too.

258
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,803
Me too. And I like Giselle.

259
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,054
I'll do a great job.

260
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,475
Warm up within 20 minutes.

261
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,685
All the Wilis, listen up.

262
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:49,438
I'll check everything
including the angle of your fingers.

263
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,740
Did they locate Ki Jun-su?

264
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:00,824
Not yet.

265
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:03,660
He's probably staying low
in case he gets caught.

266
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:04,870
We must catch him quickly.

267
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,706
It looked like Keum Ru-na
was full of spite.

268
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,292
I didn't think she'd repent right away.

269
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:11,752
Usually,

270
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,421
people full of spite go down
only after holding out to the end.

271
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:18,133
Dan, take good care of Ms. Lee.

272
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,761
Let me go talk to the reporters
before I head back.

273
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:21,929
Okay, Ms. Jung.

274
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,978
Why are you pretending like you're okay?

275
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,106
Who?

276
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,608
Me?

277
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,068
That's not true.

278
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,738
It's not just anyone.

279
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,949
Your own family tried to hurt you.

280
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:44,284
It's only natural
for you to be devastated.

281
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:46,954
I told you.

282
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,165
You can show me your weak side.

283
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:51,875
Those people

284
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,002
aren't my family anymore.

285
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,630
I only have Ms. Jung

286
00:20:58,298 --> 00:20:59,591
and you.

287
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,303
Yeon-seo, you got everything.

288
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:06,056
You have two people
who won't betray you ever.

289
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:08,767
Ever?

290
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,814
Dan, there's a place
I want to go with you.

291
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:15,607
Where?

292
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,320
Where do you want to go? Where is it?

293
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:23,657
This. I want to do this with you.

294
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:25,993
You want to take a photo?

295
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,369
Yes, let's go inside.

296
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:30,539
How do we do this?

297
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,250
Well, I don't know either.

298
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:34,710
You've never done this before?

299
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:37,713
Hey, I went to Russia to study ballet
when I was 12 years old.

300
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,673
So I didn't really have
normal school years.

301
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:42,426
You probably didn't have friends
because you were bad-tempered.

302
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:43,927
Ni-na was there too.

303
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,766
-What's this?
-What's this?

304
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,144
Let me see. Is it this?

305
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,770
That's it. That's the one.

306
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:55,897
-Okay.
-What? It already took a photo.

307
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:57,107
What is this?

308
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,784
-What is this?
-What is it?

309
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,995
Real photos came out.

310
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,288
That's fascinating.

311
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,876
These photos will last
until you become an old lady

312
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,044
with silver hair?

313
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:25,844
This is a cheap one,

314
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,763
so it will probably get faded.

315
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:29,222
What should we do then?

316
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,601
We can take one every season, every year.

317
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:42,569
This time, let's take a really funny one.

318
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:43,653
Are you in?

319
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,822
What about this one?

320
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:47,824
What?

321
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,951
My gosh, it looks great on you.

322
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,496
-That's not how you put it on.
-How do you put it on then?

323
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:20,899
Don't tell me

324
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:23,568
you thought an angel
would stay here forever.

325
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:25,570
Like dust

326
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:27,197
and powder...

327
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:29,366
He will disappear.

328
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:31,993
Because of your love.

329
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,421
What is it? Tell me what's upsetting you.

330
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,217
Should we not take the photo?

331
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,844
What can I do?

332
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,388
Don't disappear.

333
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,769
Can you not die?

334
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,484
How did you know?

335
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:06,778
You have less than a month.

336
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:08,947
When your time is up,

337
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:12,617
you'll disappear like dust.

338
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,036
You'll be gone forever.

339
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,212
I won't disappear.

340
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,798
Why would I when I have you here?

341
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:30,177
Really?

342
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:38,185
Yeon-seo. Listen carefully.

343
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:40,270
I will

344
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:43,023
become a human.

345
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:45,483
A human?

346
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:49,571
I'll make sure I become a real human.

347
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,700
I sent my report up there,
and I prayed too.

348
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,494
I haven't received a definite answer,

349
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:59,456
but I will wait and keep asking.

350
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,500
Do you trust me, Yeon-seo?

351
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:06,963
Yes.

352
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,511
Noisy Gong.

353
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,806
That's why you became a crybaby.

354
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:20,977
You should have told me.

355
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:25,023
Why were you worried all alone?

356
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:55,929
What are you doing?

357
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,347
I even thanked you.

358
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,474
I told you that I understood
what you said.

359
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:01,601
I told you that I wouldn't hurt Yeon-seo!

360
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,853
Why did you tell her?

361
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:07,440
She's crying because of you!

362
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,069
So that she can run away.

363
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,530
So that she can run away
with all her might.

364
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,907
But I guess she won't.

365
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:19,494
Lee Yeon-seo, how foolish of her.

366
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:22,664
I'm warning you.

367
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:26,876
Do not mention a word
about life and sacrifice to her.

368
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,421
If you do, I really won't stay back.

369
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:31,589
Do you understand?

370
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,342
You'll end up like me.

371
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,344
If the deity is fair,

372
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,888
you will also get destroyed like me!

373
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,564
If I was afraid of getting destroyed,

374
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:49,482
I wouldn't have returned.

375
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:06,958
1. LOSES WINGS AND DIES
2. DISAPPEARS SUDDENLY

376
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,001
3. DOES NOT BECOME A HUMAN

377
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:12,297
4. EVERYTHING IS A TRAGEDY
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS

378
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:26,895
LEE YEON-SEO

379
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:32,359
Yes, this is Ji Kang-woo.

380
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:34,527
I have a question.

381
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:39,199
You aren't an angel
at the moment, are you?

382
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,619
-Why do you ask?
-The feather

383
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:45,121
on your handkerchief was burnt in black.

384
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:46,456
Wasn't it?

385
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:50,251
How did you become a human?

386
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,587
Can Dan become a human too?

387
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,401
There is no such way. You need to give up.

388
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:16,694
Why? You became a human.

389
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,363
Tell me. Please?

390
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:21,991
I was unhappy for the last 15 years

391
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:25,328
after I became a human.

392
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:27,497
Every single moment of my life.

393
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,125
It will be

394
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,168
the same for Dan too.

395
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,586
Do you wish

396
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:36,047
to push him into such tragedy?

397
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,213
Yeon-seo found out.

398
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:21,134
She found out that I will dissipate
if I fail my mission.

399
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:25,263
Will you really give me no answer?

400
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:27,724
I have no time.

401
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:36,858
REPORT

402
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,493
Are you saying that

403
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,037
you won't take my report at all?

404
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:03,259
REPORT

405
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,555
Please give me an answer.

406
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:09,265
I wish to become a human.

407
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:18,441
It's okay. I can write another one.

408
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,777
I can write 100, no, even 200 reports.

409
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,244
Please give me an answer.
I wish to become a human.

410
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,420
Please give me an answer.
I wish to become a human.

411
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:43,591
Please give me an answer.
I wish to become a human.

412
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,352
Please give me an answer.
I wish to become a human.

413
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,605
Please give me an answer.
I wish to become a human.

414
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,775
Please give me an answer.
I wish to become a human.

415
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:09,784
Is that my answer?

416
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,327
Did I get an answer?

417
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:13,329
LADY YEON-SEO

418
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:17,959
Yes, Lady Yeon-seo.

419
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:19,586
Are you up?

420
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,421
Come out to the living room in 30 minutes.

421
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:22,380
We're going on a picnic.

422
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:24,757
Right now?

423
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,051
It's an official date.

424
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,344
Make sure you look cute.

425
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:30,889
A date?

426
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,519
A date?

427
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,315
Not this one.

428
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:43,192
My gosh.

429
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:45,862
Damn it.

430
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:49,741
I need to take a shower.

431
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,494
Where should we go, Ms. Lee?

432
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:56,122
Mountain, fields, or the sea?
Wherever you want.

433
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:59,459
Somewhere extra-special.

434
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:01,002
What?

435
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,049
Where is that?

436
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:07,175
Where?

437
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,722
Come on.

438
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:17,727
This isn't special.
We've been here dozens of times.

439
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,938
This is where we first met,

440
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,230
where we met again,

441
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:22,899
and where we cried a river.

442
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,362
It might be just a park for everyone else,

443
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,822
but for us, this place is like
a symbol of our history.

444
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,206
Let's begin our date.

445
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,168
All right. Let's see.

446
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,587
This looks good.

447
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:47,090
-Right?
-Hey, did you make this?

448
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:49,592
Let's see.

449
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:35,054
Why aren't you showing up for practice?

450
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:36,639
I know it's hard, but--

451
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:39,267
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

452
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:40,435
Thank you

453
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,353
for everything.

454
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:46,941
Ni-na.

455
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,361
Don't do this.
It may be uncomfortable, but let's work--

456
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,155
Am I a joke to you?

457
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,450
That day when you called me over
to my mom's office,

458
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,243
you already knew everything, didn't you?

459
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:59,120
Director Ji asked me to come in.

460
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:00,997
He said he had to tell me something.

461
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:03,958
There's something you must know, Ni-na.

462
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:06,127
You were using me as a threat

463
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,755
to show them that you knew everything.

464
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:11,257
Back then,

465
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,468
I had no choice.

466
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,846
I had to play my cards right, so I--

467
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:19,432
And you had the audacity
to compliment my performance.

468
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:21,809
You even said I was the Giselle
you had always dreamed of.

469
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:26,189
Do you think I'm an idiot
just because I like you?

470
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:27,690
I'm sorry.

471
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:30,026
I wasn't thinking lightly of you.

472
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:31,778
I wanted you

473
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:34,280
to never find out.

474
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:35,448
Don't be ridiculous.

475
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:40,203
You have never been sincere towards me.

476
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:45,166
And yet, I gave my all
to make you acknowledge me.

477
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,543
I regret it.

478
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:52,090
I even wished that you could use me

479
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:55,218
for your obsession over Yeon-seo.

480
00:34:57,386 --> 00:35:00,807
But then again,
I was probably useless in your eyes.

481
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:32,839
You're pretty.

482
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:34,882
You're dazzling.

483
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:46,227
Dan, I have a favor to ask.

484
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:51,357
What is it? I'll do anything for you.

485
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,985
Can you really do anything for me?

486
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,487
Of course. Just say it.

487
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:00,199
I looked into

488
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:03,327
how you could turn into a human.

489
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,001
There are three things you must do.

490
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:14,130
First, jump off a high building.

491
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:16,382
In one of the movies I've seen,

492
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:20,344
an angel jumped without his wings
from a steeple and turned into a human.

493
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:24,849
Do you think a 20-story building will do?

494
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,310
What else is there?

495
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:29,604
There needs to be a death for revival.

496
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,315
Just like how you reincarnated
as Kim Dan from Seong-u.

497
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:34,734
How about drowning in the sea?

498
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,819
Are you serious?

499
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:40,114
If not, I think you could try
holding your breath

500
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,408
until your heart stops beating.

501
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:44,994
I've tried jumping into
the sea and the river.

502
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:47,830
I felt like I was drowning,
but in the end, it was useless.

503
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:49,790
Whenever it rained,
my wings came out again.

504
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:51,918
Those won't work.

505
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,171
I see.

506
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,007
I knew it.

507
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:00,092
You knew?

508
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:03,137
No matter how much I research, I can't
figure out how you can become a human.

509
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,225
But I know how we can be together.

510
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:10,519
How?

511
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:14,273
Hold on.

512
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,484
Why are we here all of a sudden?

513
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,027
I gave it some thought.

514
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,404
"Where would be the best place?"

515
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,365
I don't believe in the deity,

516
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:24,825
but He's like a father to you.

517
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,796
Let's get married, Dan.

518
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,133
Dan.

519
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,095
-Kim Dan.
-I'll forget what you said.

520
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:45,972
Why? Why can't we?

521
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:48,808
Don't you love me? I love you too.

522
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:54,814
I love you.

523
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:56,607
I do.

524
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:59,402
What kind of shameless person
would get married

525
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:01,028
when they have limited time?

526
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,405
Why does that matter?

527
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:03,531
Snap out of it!

528
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,199
You don't even know
what will happen to me!

529
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,076
Why do you already think
that you'll disappear?

530
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,828
You can try your best to stay by my side.

531
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:11,289
You can strive to find a way
to become a human.

532
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:16,585
Let's get married.

533
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:19,338
-No.
-Let's do it.

534
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,090
-I won't.
-I will.

535
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,551
You said the deity brought us together.

536
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:26,595
Then shouldn't you take responsibility
until the end?

537
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:33,686
Please?

538
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:48,242
Dan!

539
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:49,577
Are you okay?

540
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,245
-Hyeon-u!
-Are you okay?

541
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,456
Hyeon-u! Come here!

542
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:55,166
-Mommy...
-Are you okay?

543
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,420
We need to leave. I can't be here.

544
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:00,629
I think he's seriously injured.

545
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,006
What should we do?

546
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,091
It's okay. I covered it.

547
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,929
I'm fine. I'll be fine.

548
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:12,391
-Hello, 911?
-Dan!

549
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:13,684
Dan!

550
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:26,864
Where am I?

551
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:29,909
Are you awake?
You're at the emergency center.

552
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,501
Gosh, my head hurts.

553
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,588
Yeon-seo, why does my head hurt?

554
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:44,757
Your bleeding didn't stop.

555
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:47,426
I saw it with my own eyes.

556
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,720
While they stopped the bleeding
and treated you,

557
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,765
your wound didn't heal by itself.

558
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,444
Gosh, that hurts.

559
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:08,239
Goodness, that stings.

560
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:24,296
Last time, your wound healed
in five seconds.

561
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,424
Right.

562
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:28,634
Do you think...

563
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,511
No way.

564
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,932
This easily? Did you do something?

565
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,517
How are you already a human?

566
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:41,772
Please give me an answer.
I wish to become a human.

567
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:44,692
I think the deity accepted my request.

568
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,486
I think the deity felt my sincerity.

569
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,071
It's still strange.

570
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:52,324
Is it really this easy for an angel
to become a human?

571
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:57,079
The deity doesn't ignore
desperate prayers.

572
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,415
Perhaps, that's why.

573
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:02,668
I hope you're right.

574
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:07,173
Right, the rain.
We can check once it rains.

575
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:08,966
If your wings pop out,
you're still an angel.

576
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:09,925
But if not,

577
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:14,763
that means you have become a human, right?

578
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:24,857
WEEKLY WEATHER FORECAST

579
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:26,442
It's sunny again.

580
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,028
Dan.

581
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:30,404
Yes?

582
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,864
Since it's sunny,

583
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,575
-do you want to get married?
-What?

584
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,077
Dan, aren't you thankful?

585
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:38,996
Yes, I'm happy.

586
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:40,706
Since you're happy,

587
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:42,666
do you want to get married?

588
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:45,878
Look at the moon.

589
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:47,713
It's so bright.

590
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,633
I guess it'll be sunny tomorrow as well.

591
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:55,888
I guess this was how the ancestors felt
when they held a ritual for rain.

592
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,476
I imagined

593
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:03,312
how it'd be if it rained.

594
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:06,690
And?

595
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:09,235
I kind of wish it didn't rain.

596
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,072
I just want us

597
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:18,577
to be happy like how we are now.

598
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:20,913
But we need to check.

599
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,665
How things will end up?

600
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,960
Don't say anything
that has the word "end" in it.

601
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,380
I'm sorry.

602
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:32,675
Don't say that you're sorry either.

603
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:34,927
You know...

604
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:37,763
Even if

605
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:41,433
we find out that you're still not a human,

606
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,728
don't you dare apologize to me.

607
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:46,897
Okay?

608
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:56,865
What?

609
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:00,619
I thought it'd be sunny
for the next two days.

610
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:26,478
Please answer my prayer.

611
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:29,648
Please allow me only one thing.

612
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:32,151
Allow me to be with Dan.

613
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:57,468
Are they out?

614
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:07,686
No.

615
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,272
I guess you really became a human!

616
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:13,233
Thank you. Thank you so much!

617
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:16,236
He answered my prayer for the first time!

618
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:21,033
Let me take a look.

619
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:23,744
You really are a human, right?

620
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:26,163
You're going to stay by my side
to the day you die, right?

621
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:03,826
Something

622
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:07,037
that I couldn't even dream of
happened to me.

623
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:10,249
It was

624
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:12,418
the only miracle in my life.

625
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,045
-It was love.
-It was love.

626
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:34,750
What happened to me?

627
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:36,251
Didn't I become a human?

628
00:46:36,793 --> 00:46:38,921
My wings didn't come out
when I got rained on last night.

629
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:40,756
Look at the scab.

630
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,133
My body doesn't heal quickly
when I get hurt.

631
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,718
It's because I'm a human, right?

632
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,846
You foolish one.

633
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:50,015
I have a human body, don't I?

634
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:52,142
I have bones, flesh, and a heart.

635
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:55,354
But why can't I touch things?

636
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:57,731
Did you check your handkerchief?

637
00:46:58,273 --> 00:47:01,151
When an angel's mission is over
and its reason for existence disappears,

638
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,362
whether the angel becomes
a human or is dissipated,

639
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:04,571
once it is no longer an angel,

640
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:07,366
the feather on the handkerchief
is burnt black.

641
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:11,328
It means you are still an angel.

642
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:13,747
You will never become a human.

643
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,124
That's the deity's answer to your prayer.

644
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:17,793
There's only one way.

645
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:21,380
However, if you take it, you'll live
in hell just like Ji Kang-woo.

646
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:27,052
I won't use that method.

647
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:30,556
I don't even know how.
And I don't want to know it either.

648
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:32,057
I don't want to be an angel

649
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:35,102
or a human in a world without Yeon-seo.

650
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:40,148
Why did you have to take things that far?

651
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,317
It wasn't me.

652
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:45,904
It was my heart

653
00:47:46,863 --> 00:47:47,906
that took me this far.

654
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:54,037
Then what's happening to my body?

655
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,373
Is he mocking me?
Why didn't the wings come out?

656
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:58,208
Why didn't my injury heal?

657
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,460
Because depending on the special mission,

658
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,504
a time limit is set for the body.

659
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:04,089
It's a blinker.

660
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:05,632
It's a warning.

661
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:08,510
A warning that your time with the body
is almost up.

662
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:32,618
You really are a human, right?

663
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:35,954
You're going to stay by my side
to the day you die, right?

664
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:14,534
ANGEL, LEE YEON-SEO

665
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:15,744
KIM DAN, YOO SEONG-U

666
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,586
KIM DAN

667
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:31,718
Did you talk to Hu?

668
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:33,303
Yes.

669
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:36,348
You said you're doing something
like a rehearsal today, right?

670
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:39,101
It's not an official one.

671
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:41,645
We're just checking our positions
and the lights. Stuff like that.

672
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:44,898
I'm sorry.

673
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:47,234
I think

674
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:49,069
I'm going to be late.

675
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:52,864
You must have a lot to discuss with Hu.

676
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:55,909
It's fine with me. I can go with Ms. Jung.

677
00:49:58,662 --> 00:49:59,538
I'm sorry.

678
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:02,999
You're not supposed to say that anymore.
Remember?

679
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:04,042
I'm sorry.

680
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:12,926
I'll just see you tonight.

681
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:14,886
Come home safely.

682
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:39,995
May I help you with anything?

683
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,540
Do you have rapeseed flowers?

684
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:45,459
I'm not sure. Their season is almost over.

685
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,421
Wait, I have them. I have one bunch left.

686
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:51,256
I'll take that.

687
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:01,433
Are these for your girlfriend?

688
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:03,977
Girlfriend?

689
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:10,150
Yes.

690
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:13,904
I'm going to give them
to someone I love with all my heart.

691
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:16,198
I guess you really love her.

692
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:18,867
But why are you giving her
rapeseed flowers out of all?

693
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:21,328
Usually, guys go for roses.

694
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:25,373
We promised to see them together
next spring,

695
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:27,751
but I might not

696
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,130
be able to see them with her.

697
00:51:58,198 --> 00:51:59,533
It's been three years since you

698
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:01,952
started to work
for Fantasia's Lighting Team, right?

699
00:52:02,994 --> 00:52:03,870
Yes.

700
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:47,122
What are you doing?

701
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:52,752
Why aren't you answering my calls?

702
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,256
How could I?

703
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:57,549
Don't run away.

704
00:52:57,716 --> 00:53:00,594
How could I continue
to dance for Fantasia?

705
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:02,512
You didn't know.

706
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:04,890
No.

707
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:08,560
Perhaps, I might have known.

708
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:11,980
And I might have wished for it.

709
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:13,899
That I would die?

710
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:18,445
Just thinking about something
isn't a crime,

711
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:21,114
although we probably still
can't be friends.

712
00:53:21,197 --> 00:53:24,034
My family hurt you.

713
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:26,161
They killed

714
00:53:27,245 --> 00:53:28,163
Mr. Cho.

715
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:30,332
How can I lift my head up and--

716
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:31,958
It was amazing. Your Giselle.

717
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:38,131
It was different from mine,
but it was excellent.

718
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:41,176
I wish to be

719
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:44,012
on a team with a talented ballerina.

720
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:47,766
And do not run away.

721
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:50,810
Keep seeing me here and get tormented.

722
00:53:52,228 --> 00:53:54,147
Consider that as your punishment.

723
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:15,543
For the music to sound grand,
we placed a speaker

724
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:17,545
on the top left corner
and one on the top right corner.

725
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:19,214
The pin light will drop from the middle.

726
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:22,550
Lastly, for the main part,
I'll set the top lights

727
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:23,551
on top of the stage.

728
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:25,637
Console, are you ready?

729
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:28,807
We'll begin the spacing tech rehearsal
in ten minutes.

730
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:05,635
I thought you couldn't come.

731
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:07,095
You even brought flowers.

732
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:12,684
Rapeseed flowers.

733
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:16,438
It isn't even a real performance.
You didn't need to do this.

734
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:20,108
I wanted to give that to you
when I first saw you.

735
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:22,527
When?

736
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:24,237
During Fantasia's 20th Anniversary Party.

737
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:27,032
You were there?

738
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:30,452
I saw your dance.

739
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:37,459
You were the most beautiful on that day,
so I wanted to give it to you.

740
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:50,305
So let's get married.

741
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:53,141
That again? I said I can't.

742
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,143
Let us begin the rehearsal.

743
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:58,438
It'll be a small and simple wedding
just between the two of us.

744
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:03,485
I am going to marry you no matter what.

745
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:07,864
I'll use this as my bouquet,
so keep it well.

746
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:09,657
Okay? I'm going inside.

747
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:25,632
You're so stubborn.

748
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:27,759
Kim Dan.

749
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:30,178
You fool.

750
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:12,595
I'm sorry.

751
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:15,807
Remember? You're not supposed to
say that anymore.

752
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:20,520
I'm sorry.

753
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:25,859
I'll just see you tonight.

754
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:27,777
Come home safely.

755
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:41,708
I'm not going to cry.

756
00:57:44,752 --> 00:57:45,628
Let's see

757
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:47,338
who wins.

758
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:51,426
I'm going to do everything
that I want to do with Dan.

759
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:47,315
Where is the wind coming from?

760
00:59:23,351 --> 00:59:24,602
Don't say a word.

761
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:31,150
Death.

762
00:59:34,445 --> 00:59:35,405
I didn't hear anything.

763
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:36,322
You

764
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:39,826
know everything. Stop pretending.

765
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:49,335
I don't want to be a human.
I won't become one.

766
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:51,296
I gave up on everything. I surrender.

767
00:59:51,879 --> 00:59:53,423
I'll just dissipate. I'll disappear.

768
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:56,801
I'm determined to do that. Okay?

769
00:59:57,468 --> 00:59:58,386
On that day,

770
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:02,724
it wasn't just you
who received your final chance.

771
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:14,694
She should have died on that day too.

772
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:18,406
That was her fate.

773
01:00:20,491 --> 01:00:21,743
How can that be?

774
01:00:22,535 --> 01:00:23,494
It was fate

775
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:27,290
that we met again.

776
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:29,834
Her fate was to be killed by the wicked.

777
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:32,170
Some people are born that way.

778
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:34,881
No.

779
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:36,674
No way.

780
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:38,301
It was just postponed, that's all.

781
01:00:39,093 --> 01:00:40,928
No matter how much
you try to escape from it,

782
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:44,182
a prophecy will come to pass.

783
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:45,975
One's destiny

784
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:49,270
will be fulfilled.

785
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:54,836
Let's do it.

786
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:02,677
Will you

787
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:06,514
marry me?

788
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:08,433
Yeon-seo.

789
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,129
I wish to marry Ms. Lee.

790
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:22,465
I know I am not good enough,
but if you give me your permission--

791
01:03:22,548 --> 01:03:23,382
In your dreams.

792
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:24,717
Never!

793
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:26,344
Ms. Lee, marriage is--

794
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:29,263
-Do you want to officiate our wedding?
-Me?

795
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:33,142
No, I will change it.

796
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:34,435
I will

797
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:37,522
save Dan.
