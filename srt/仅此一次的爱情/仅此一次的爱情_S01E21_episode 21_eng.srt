1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:04,240
 Do you like me that much? 

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,960
 Funny, isn't it? 

3
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,610
 A tragedy turns into a comedy. 

4
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:27,750
 Then something you think was a comedy turns into a tragedy. 

5
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,100
 Yeon Seo...
(Lady Yeon Seo ♡ ) 

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,640
 It would have been great if you'd stayed blind. 

7
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,320
 Receiving those corneas to get your vision back, 

8
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,870
 that luck is actually your tragedy. 

9
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:52,990
 If you remained as a pretty doll, who lived her life as if she was dead, 

10
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:56,220
 you wouldn't have had to die so soon. 

11
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:11,040
 I love you, Yeon Seo. 

12
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,420
 What do you want to see? The river, sea, trees, fields: tell me everything you want. 

13
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,420
 I'll take you there. 

14
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:20,410
 I have to see the river, sea, 

15
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:25,710
 trees and fields. I wanted to see those things with you. 

16
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,270
 Dan. 

17
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:43,290
♫  As if it's a coincidence, like the scene of wind blow off by me  ♫

18
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:48,950
♫  my heart remembers you  ♫

19
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,630
Are you okay?

20
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,050
Look at me, Yeon Seo.

21
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,070
It's me.

22
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,430
Kim Dan?

23
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,580
That's right. It's me.

24
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:11,570
So, relax.

25
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,890
It's okay.

26
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,580
Is it...

27
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,830
really you?

28
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,600
And these wings.

29
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:33,140
You flew in...

30
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,730
from over there?

31
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,870
♫  our gaze met  ♫

32
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,620
You...

33
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,530
You...

34
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,140
Really, what are you?

35
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:55,780
♫  The one and only love  ♫

36
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,300
♫  I was poor at love  ♫

37
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:04,470
♫  and it was hard for me  ♫

38
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:10,620
♫  Please be a scene that last  ♫

39
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,440
♫  even after a long time  ♫

40
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:21,660
♫  You are shining towards me  ♫

41
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,900
   

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,830


43
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,320
You reported it, right?

44
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,220
Where are you? I don't see anyone who fell.

45
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,390
I'm sorry, it must be the rain. I think I saw something wrong.

46
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,120
The call was a mistake.

47
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,090
No one fell. Let's go.

48
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:19,940
   

49
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,320
Where are you right now? Let's meet.

50
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,750
I'm sorry.

51
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,630
I was so late

52
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,490
that you had to find out like this.

53
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,190
Mom? Dad?

54
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:42,070
Mister? Dan?

55
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,200
Are you done?

56
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:12,170
Well, I did push her off, but she wasn't there.

57
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,150
What do you mean?

58
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,550
 I didn't see her, nor was there any trace of someone moving her. 

59
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,580
Yes, so what kind of nonsense is this?

60
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,760
I'm not sure what's going on either.

61
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,590
Come here immediately and tell me.

62
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:26,820
No, I'll take care of this before I come.

63
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,850
He pushed her off,

64
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,130
but she's not there?

65
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:04,750
 Come to that place immediately. 

66
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:22,260
You really came. Sit down.

67
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,360
Would you like a drink?

68
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,930
- Did you make a toast? 
- Pardon?

69
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:30,690
I thought you cared about your sister. You look awfully relaxed.

70
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:35,560
Or did something good happen?

71
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:43,080
Director Ji, didn't Ni Na really do well today?

72
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,850
Imagine how heartbroken she must be since she gave it her all.

73
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:50,330
That's why I'm drinking.

74
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,510
Was it wrong for me to do that?

75
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,550
What is this?

76
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:03,430
   

77
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,520
Yeon Seo.

78
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,500
Did she really send this? Where is she? Why are you here?

79
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,760
It must've been general Director Choi's order.

80
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,550
She always despised Yeon Seo, and in spite of all the bribes, Yeon Seo won the audition.

81
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:19,910
Did she decide to get rid of her once and for all?

82
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,630
Director Ji. What are yo—

83
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:27,970
Your family is the only one with a good enough reason to do something like this.

84
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:38,120
Did you just smile?

85
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:43,920
Director Ji, this world isn't that simple.

86
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,340
Resentment and sugarcoating aren't always everything.

87
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:50,620
There are some humans who even commit murder

88
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:54,990
just because they didn't like the way someone looked at them.

89
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,400
Is Yeon Seo alive? Is she badly injured?

90
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,840
You're curious about whether she's alive or not.

91
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,820
I didn't even tell you what happened.

92
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,350
You showed me the text.

93
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,700
She felt too much pressure, so she wanted to end it.

94
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,250
This is my final warning.

95
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:23,200
Don't ever touch her again.

96
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:36,410
You're alive?

97
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:49,160
What was your plan? Were you going to let the entire world know?

98
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,710
We've been covering up all the incidents as accidents,

99
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,910
but if you kill her yourself,

100
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,840
both of us will go down.

101
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,220
I'm sorry. I just wanted to wrap it up—

102
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,520
Enough with your excuses.

103
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:04,030
Lie low for the time being. Don't try anything rash.

104
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:08,370
Don't be foolish. Do you understand?

105
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:09,920
Yes.

106
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:34,320
Why are you so cruel?

107
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:43,880
 Please have pity for them. 

108
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,590
Are you awake?

109
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:18,220
How do you feel?

110
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,180
Can you get up?

111
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,680
Were you here all night

112
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,030
because of what happened yesterday?

113
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:32,080
Yeon Seo, listen carefully. Yesterday, you—

114
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,820
What happened?

115
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,850
I can't remember.

116
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:48,650
The last thing I remember was going with you to the park.

117
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,210
Did I pass out?

118
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:57,470
You really can't remember anything?

119
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,550
You don't remember at all?

120
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:04,750
My body is sore,

121
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:09,270
but it has always been sore every morning.

122
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:12,180
Tell me what happened.

123
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,870
 Miss! 

124
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,850
Oh, right. The appointment with Ms. Jeong. Did you call her?

125
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:26,280
Huh? Yes.

126
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,020
Wait for me outside. I'll take a shower and come out.

127
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:39,380
Don't treat me like a kid just because I fainted once.

128
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,720
I'll wait outside.

129
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,820
He must be really worried.

130
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,320
Please stay close to her,

131
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,550
especially when she's at the ballet theatre. And about her room...

132
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,350
What's going on?

133
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:28,330
I've decided to strengthen our security.

134
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:30,960
They'll be on watch over three shifts, 24 hours a day.

135
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,950
I told you I don't want to be watched 24 hours a day.

136
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,710
I have to put someone on you.

137
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:39,320
You left me waiting in the rain and didn't even pick up your phone.

138
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,220
Dan told me that he called you.

139
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,960
He did. Extremely late.

140
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,720
And the first thing he said was to recruit the security team. At that late hour.

141
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,430
I knew it was you. He's overreacting. Don't listen to him.

142
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:57,610
Still, better safe than sorry. What's wrong with being cautious?

143
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:01,090
Let's do this for now. Just one week, please?

144
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:04,710
I remembered everything.

145
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:07,390
I know what happened yesterday.

146
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,260
- Let's go inside and talk. 
- The red balloon.

147
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,870
 Lee Yeon Seo! 

148
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:28,280
 You were across the street, holding it. 

149
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:33,510
 That's when I passed out, right? 

150
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:41,070
I only remember up to that part. I fainted at that moment.

151
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,670
 Is she remembering something that didn't even happen? 

152
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,940
 It can't be... 

153
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:50,240
You don't have to be too worried just because I fainted once.

154
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,030
You see

155
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,680
all I need is you.

156
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,450
You can whisper sweet things in his ear when you're alone.

157
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:01,570
There's only one Dan.

158
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:06,030
If you want him next to you, we need other people to watch the house.

159
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:11,550
The security team will start their patrol from today.

160
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,390
Where's Ni Na?

161
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:29,080
She left at dawn to practice.

162
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,850
She must've cried all night. And you let her go?

163
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:36,330
It's not over yet. She needs to practice.

164
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,520
Did you even do your job?

165
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,070
Why were we missing two votes when you acquired 13?

166
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:43,620
I told you it couldn't be guaranteed.

167
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:48,850
Are you saying we'll have to give up the foundation and the prima ballerina position?

168
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:51,010
No. I won't have that.

169
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,380
It's the same for Ni Na.

170
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:56,470
A dancer who has had a taste of the spotlight can never return to being just a shadow.

171
00:17:56,470 --> 00:18:00,180
She'll make it. She'll perform "Giselle."

172
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,750
How?

173
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:06,780
I'll have to find a way.

174
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:12,190
But for today, let's get ready to meet our new Giselle.

175
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:26,510
What are you doing?

176
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,340
No.

177
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,710
I said I'm fine.

178
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,440
You fainted. You need to rest.

179
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,100
How could a prima ballerina miss the first practice after her audition?

180
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,060
You have your reasons. Don't go.

181
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,360
Give it to me.

182
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,290
Just get some rest.

183
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:46,970
Are you that worried?

184
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,910
I am worried to death.

185
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,360
   

186
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,410
- This is Kim Dan.
  - Put Yeon Seo on the phone. 

187
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:12,080
You can talk to me. I'm her secretary.

188
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,790
How are you still her secretary?

189
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:16,840
Did you show her your wings and threaten her?

190
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,110
Stop talking nonsense. If that's all, I'm hanging up.

191
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:26,820
Director Ji, this is me, Yeon Seo. Why didn't you call me directly?

192
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,930
 I called you to tell you to take the day off. 

193
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,990
Why? Is practice canceled?

194
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,390
I'm sure you were shocked.

195
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:34,200
 Take a day off. I'll see you after you rest up. 

196
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,990
I'll look into what happened yesterday.

197
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:42,310
What will you be looking into?

198
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:46,090
- Why is everyone making a fuss? I'm all right. 
- But yesterday, you—

199
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:49,760
I just fainted. That's all. I guess my secretary must have made a big fuss about it.

200
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,820
Please don't worry about it.

201
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:57,120
Fainted?

202
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:04,630
- Yeon Seo. 
- I must've dropped my phone at the park. Let's go back.

203
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:08,040
- Let's just buy a new one. 
- No, I have to find it.

204
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,700
Why?

205
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:37,340
Never mind, I'll go alone. You were following me around like a puppy this morning. Why don't you want to follow me to the park?

206
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,610
I'll go to the park.

207
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:44,620
I'll find it. Stay here until I come back. Don't go anywhere.

208
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,390
Promise me.

209
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:51,500
Okay. I promise.

210
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:22,820
I'm glad you're both here.

211
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,810
What's this about?

212
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:26,270
There's something I wanted to show you.

213
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,710
"I'm sorry Director, it's too burdensome and I don't have the confidence,

214
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:33,260
I guess this is the end for me.

215
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:38,250
I will end it all at the ballet theatre I've loved."

216
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,930
What is that?

217
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:43,240
Could it be, my Ni Na?

218
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,090
What are you doing right now?

219
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:48,030
It's a message sent by Lee Yeon Seo.

220
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:53,950
No, to be precise, it's a message sent by whoever kidnapped Lee Yeon Seo yesterday.

221
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:01,190
What's this atrocity I'm hearing, Lee Roo Na?

222
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:05,460
Didn't we put an end to this discussion yesterday?

223
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:09,610
Using a text message to accuse us is enough to charge you with defamation.

224
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:12,360
So, did something happen to Yeon Seo?

225
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,900
Nothing happened.

226
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,500
How do you know that?

227
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:19,930
If an accident had happened, you wouldn't be here.

228
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,060
So, right now you're saying that Yeon Seo was kidnapped

229
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,540
and you're suspecting us?

230
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,420
Bring your evidence.

231
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:31,830
Rather, if you find evidence go straight to the police.

232
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,570
Stop bothering people. It's tiring.

233
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:34,590
I'm planning on it.

234
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:38,120
But I'm here to warn you in advance.

235
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,580
Excuse me, Director Ji!

236
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:42,240
We have nothing to do with it. What warning?

237
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,700
Just what on earth you two would go this far for,

238
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,890
I've thought about it.

239
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,270
Come in.

240
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:02,050
Why are you here?

241
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:04,020
Director Ji asked me to come.

242
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,520
He said he has something to say.

243
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,110
There's something I must tell you, Ms. Ni Na.

244
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,840
Hey, Director Ji Kang Woo!

245
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,420
What is it?

246
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:17,660
It's the first time you've contacted me separately.

247
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,860
What is this about?

248
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,850
You danced well.

249
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:29,120
Yesterday's Giselle was wonderful. It was the Giselle I've imagined.

250
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,640
You were really great, Ms. Ni Na.

251
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,880
These two people in front of you,

252
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,420
love you so much that they would do anything for you.

253
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:45,040
That's why I wanted to say this with all of you here.

254
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,430
You worked hard.

255
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,170
Bye, then.

256
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,850
     

257
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:24,560
She's so cute.

258
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:31,110
"I'm sorry Director." 
    

259
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:34,190
"It's too burdensome and I don't have the confidence."

260
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:37,850
"I'm going to end it all."

261
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,870
What are you going to do?

262
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:18,690
They tried... to hurt a person.

263
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:22,810
They are her family, the only family she has left.

264
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:25,320
Her family did that.

265
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:29,160
So, are you going to hurt people just like they did?

266
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,190
How long do you think He will tolerate you?

267
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:34,890
"The day of the Lord will come like a thief." Behave yourself.

268
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,370
You knew, didn't you? Were you just staring at her?

269
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:45,440
Weren't you the one who got rid of Yeon Seo's memory?

270
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,350
Why did you erase her memory? You told me not to do anything to humans!

271
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:14,410
Why did you spread your wings in front of humans? Whose fault is all this?

272
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:18,260
I was going to tell her. I was going to tell her the truth anyway.

273
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:21,610
Whether she accepts me or not, that depends on Yeon Seo.

274
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:22,890
Why did you erase her memory?!

275
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:26,830
Instead of trembling in fear because of that terrible memory, it's better not to know anything.

276
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:29,460
After all, the moment she finds out you're an angel, your relationship with Noisy Gong

277
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,350
will be over!

278
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:38,720
That's cowardly of you.

279
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,960
I didn't know... an angel could be such a coward.

280
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:49,220
Angels are meant only to be bystanders.

281
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:54,530
So if... it's her fate to be murdered by someone,

282
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,870
you must accept it.

283
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,220
That makes no sense.

284
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,820
If I can save her, I should.

285
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:06,120
That's a good deed and it's our job.

286
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,450
No. Bringing confusion into this world is considered evil.

287
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:16,680
Someone will be a sacrifice for another's criminal act,

288
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,760
and someone will die at the peak of their life.

289
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,650
And some people live until they're a hundred years old,

290
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:23,720
but some people die as soon as they're born.

291
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,070
This is the fate of humans!

292
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:34,920
I can't understand this. I was told everyone is important.

293
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,710
He loves them.

294
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:39,880
Then, no one should face an unfair death.

295
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:44,170
But He... and angels like us

296
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,690
won't take responsibility and will just watch it happen?

297
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:52,280
If you think we're irresponsible,

298
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,650
that means you're selfish.

299
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:59,960
Look into your heart. You don't want to save everyone who dies wrongfully.

300
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,910
You want to save only one person, Lee Yeon Seo.

301
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:09,280
 Don't try to tell Noisy Gong who you are. 

302
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:13,080
 You don't have time to be greedy. 

303
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:27,470
