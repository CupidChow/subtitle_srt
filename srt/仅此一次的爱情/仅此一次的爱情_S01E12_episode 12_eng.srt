1
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:05,170
   

2
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:16,460


3
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,910
Are you nervous to stand in front of the sponsors?

4
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:37,290
I lived all my life getting attention on stage. Nervous? No way.

5
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,730
 What's important is the people. Don't miss anyone who looks suspicious. 

6
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:48,020
Wait...

7
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:00,240
 What's going on? 

8
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,530
Oh, I'm sorry.

9
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,910
 - Why did he fall? 
 - What happened?  

10
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,240
What are you doing?

11
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,350
Hey, just leave before everyone stares at you.

12
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,760
Make two more glasses. Hurry!

13
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,770
It's okay. Go back to work.

14
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,100
Gwang Il.

15
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,050
Chairman Geum, I was following the order of the general director.

16
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:00,450
I know. But you can't. Never.

17
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:07,020
You shouldn't hurt a person no matter who gave you the order.

18
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,890
Why isn't he coming? She'll be making a speech after that segment.

19
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:38,080
Mr. Park won't come.

20
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,610
How do you know?

21
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:50,730
What is this? A sleeping pill? Sedative?

22
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,650
Were you going to let Yeon Seo collapse in front of everyone?

23
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,210
I told her that we shouldn't do it. I told her that it cannot happen.

24
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:01,390
I mean it, Gi Cheon.

25
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,780
You, how much do you know?

26
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:35,830
You already know that Mr. Park is a pushover. Why do you keep taking a risk?

27
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:10,390
Did you all enjoy the performance? Your precious contributions

28
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,910
made Fantasia what it is today.

29
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,120
We truly thank you.

30
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:28,840
And now, I would like to make an important announcement.

31
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,820
As of now, I, Choi Yeong Ja,

32
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,780
who loved Fantasia with all of her heart,

33
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:48,520
who worked as the general director of Fantasia, will resign.

34
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:59,610
Let me introduce the lady who will take charge of Fantasia's future.

35
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:07,130
Please welcome my lovely niece, Lee Yeon Seo, with a round of applause.

36
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,560
 I was trying to smoke. 

37
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,140
 Bastard!  (Speaking in Japanese)

38
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,350
What did you say about their thighs and (complain) you can't hold (my) hand?

39
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:15,610
You pervert. You can't even tell the difference between ballet and pornography?

40
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:18,890
This isn't your brothel, you scumbag.

41
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,960
You speak Japanese?

42
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,260
I can even say "scumbag" in French.

43
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,320
What are you doing?

44
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,110
 My goodness. What is it? 

45
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:32,530
You ignorant idiots.

46
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:38,320
Please, I beg you. Could you please spend your filthy money elsewhere?

47
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:43,480
You guys make me sick.

48
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:49,730
Please, everyone. Stop acting so sophisticated.

49
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,630
Sorry, sir. Let's get out of here.

50
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,380
What's going on?

51
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,200
Where are you going, you perverts?

52
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:07,070
Where are you going? Stay and see to the end!

53
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,220
Come here.

54
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,290
You Japanese geezer. You wanted me to dance?

55
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:15,110
Where are you going? Where?!

56
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,390
- Where are you going? 
- Ms. Lee.

57
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:23,220
Fine. I'll show you then.

58
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,900
Music! Cue!

59
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,980
It's you again?

60
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,540
Yes. It's me.

61
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,090
It's always you.

62
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,550
You idiot.

63
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:59,170
Don't go.

64
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,090
Don't go.

65
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,180
Are you awake?

66
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,100
How did I come home yesterday?

67
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,870
Do you really not remember anything?

68
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:50,270
 You pervert. You can't even tell the difference between ballet and pornography? 

69
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:53,760
 I can even say "scumbag" in French. 

70
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,770
Darn it.

71
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,880
Where's Kim Dan?

72
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,610
He took care of you all night and then switched with me, saying he had somewhere to go.

73
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:04,560
Were you in that much pain that you had to drink?

74
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,100
Still, you said you'd be careful.

75
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,340
I didn't even have a sip of wine.

76
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:15,690
Ms. Jung, could you bring me my phone?

77
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,170
   

78
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,330
Please call Dr. Lee.

79
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,870
Are you feeling sick?

80
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,320
Is Lee Yeon Seo out of her mind?

81
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,330
That's why I told you.

82
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:43,290
She is still physically and mentally unstable.

83
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:46,120
And it seems to be getting worse.

84
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,520
That prima ballerina, chairwoman, or whatever she may be,

85
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,440
swore in front of us, which was absolutely unforgivable.

86
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,900
But on top of that, are we supposed to condone that young artistic director's brazen attitude?

87
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,630
Are we? Why?

88
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:05,270
Sir, please calm down for my sake. Okay?

89
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:09,280
It's also impressive how you and your daughter maintained your temporary positions

90
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:13,010
for so long.

91
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:17,440
That mad heiress will run this ballet theatre and also perform?

92
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,290
Please give me a logical reason why I should invest my precious money

93
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,690
into this preposterous ballet theatre.

94
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:28,070
Director Ji, say something.

95
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,200
Do as you please.

96
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,040
- What? 
- What is he saying?

97
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,500
But if you back out now,

98
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,870
I won't allow you to become a sponsor for "Giselle."

99
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:53,490
It's a chance for your name to be listed under Korea's best performance. This is your last chance.

100
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:58,810
Are you telling us not to miss out on a chance to spend our money?

101
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:07,610
I will no longer support this ballet theatre.

102
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,310
I don't know what you all may think,

103
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:17,530
but our company will cease to do any business that concerns Fantasia.

104
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,440
Director.

105
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:00,060
- A strike? 
- Everyone on the ship saw it.

106
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,440
It's ridiculous for her to become the prima ballerina.

107
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,770
What if she suddenly acts out while performing? Who will be responsible for her injuries?

108
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:09,090
Are you done?

109
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:12,590
Geum Ni Na, do you have anything to say?

110
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:16,890
I think it's a problem if the corps cannot acknowledge the prima ballerina.

111
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:20,710
The prima ballerina should be someone whom everyone can agree on.

112
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,960
I'm baffled.

113
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:30,770
I thought Lee Yeon Seo would be the one to bail out, not you people.

114
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:33,800
Are you saying that she's going to quit?

115
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,850
No. I'm talking about performing with you all.

116
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:43,180
I was worried she'd say that she wouldn't be able to perform

117
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,630
with such an incompetent corps.

118
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:50,120
The five who performed "Spanish," did you know the angle of your elbows were terrible?

119
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:56,120
Yi Geon, I said not to smile or frown excessively, but you had a stiff face all night long. Were you at a funeral?

120
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,930
Geum Ni Na!

121
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:02,550
You were so focused on keeping the rhythm that your dance moves were dull, yet you mentioned acknowledging...

122
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,570
and agreeing?!

123
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,790
I couldn't feel anything. Do you even listen to the music?

124
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:13,540
Do you even understand the story? Lee Yeon Seo,

125
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:19,720
she could just stand in front of me and my body would feel electrified. So how...!

126
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:25,110
How are all your dance moves... so empty? How?

127
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,090
Why?!

128
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,710
 Lee Yeon Seo, 

129
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:45,110
 she could just stand in front of me and my body would feel electrified. So how...! 

130
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:49,450
 How are all your dance moves... so empty? 

131
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,280
 Why?! 

132
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,230
This is awful.

133
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:03,930
I'm being awful to myself.

134
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:07,160
I'm so awful that I'm not Lee Yeon Seo!

135
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,320
What's there to yell about?

136
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:13,670
You're totally wasted in broad daylight.

137
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,070
Is that her?

138
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:28,440
Ms. Elena? Ms. Elena!

139
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,840
Teacher!

140
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:36,200
Teacher!

141
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,790
Teacher!

142
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:41,630
Teacher! Teacher!

143
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,700
Teacher!

144
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:47,190
You're Ms. Elena, right?

145
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:49,000
It's me, Ni Na.

146
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,460
I learned ballet from you when I was a kid for the first time, Geum Ni Na!

147
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,530
Get lost!

148
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:59,320
I thought about you from time to time.

149
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,220
I missed you.

150
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:05,860
I told you to get lost. The mere mention of Fantasia disgusts me.

151
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:09,340
It makes me furious! Go away!

152
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:14,270
I must be having a terrible day today.

153
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:32,040
You want a list of guests and agencies who participated in yesterday's event?

154
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,230
Yes. There's something I want to look into.

155
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,860
Please.

156
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:44,130
That's too bad. I can't share personal information like that.

157
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:49,660
Then, why don't we investigate together?

158
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:52,430
Investigate what?

159
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:56,660
Are you thinking that someone could have harmed Yeon Seo yesterday?

160
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,850
I would like to believe that I'm wrong.

161
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:03,450
That's why I want to look into this.

162
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:07,360
Yeon Seo recently got her surgery. And she worked too much to return as a dancer.

163
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,950
Considering her circumstances,  a glass of wine is enough to push her over the edge.

164
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:15,070
To clarify, you already made up your mind that it's completely

165
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:17,640
Yeon Seo's fault.

166
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,660
There's no reason to deny that, logically speaking.

167
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,320
I understand.

168
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:31,910
Actually, I expected that you would be eager to help me investigate

169
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,850
because you're her family.

170
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,220
What brings you here?

171
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,690
Director Ji isn't here now.

172
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,290
Excuse me.

173
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,970
What do you think you're doing?

174
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:52,070
Before I report you for obstruction of business, leave immediately.

175
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,290
I'll take care of him.

176
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:03,280
Just keep an eye on him for now.

177
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,100
He's cute.

178
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:14,590
If I run the blood test now, I'll get the results tonight at the earliest.

179
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:17,540
Please take care of it. And you, too.

180
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:21,690
Don't worry. I know a glass of wine wouldn't get you that drunk.

181
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:25,190
Once we get the result, we might be able to catch who it is.

182
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:49,140
I went to the ballet theatre.

183
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,900
How is it there?

184
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,930
Actually, it's so obvious. The sponsors probably demanded to kick me out, and the dancers will be gossiping about me.

185
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:01,230
"She's unbelievable." "She was crazy."

186
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:07,200
Everything will be resolved. I believe that it wasn't your fault.

187
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,890
How will belief resolve anything?

188
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,900
My niece, you look gaunt.

189
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,330
Why are you here? What do you want to know?

190
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:42,770
Don't be so harsh. I barely managed to calm down those sponsors who wanted to barge in here.

191
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:45,560
What do they want? Do they want me to kneel down?

192
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,310
It would be great if it was that simple.

193
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,230
Mr. Park.

194
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,690
   

195
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,880
I truly did my best to help you.

196
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,850
When you weren't at your best, I tried to protect you by extending the power of attorney.

197
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:19,690
And when you stubbornly asked me to give it back, I even announced that I would be resigning.

198
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:20,780
   

199
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,630
You know what?

200
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:30,160
Power of attorney or extension, forget about those.

201
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:36,270
Give everything to me. You must.

202
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,160
I don't need money from those perverted sponsors.

203
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,550
I'll sell the house to pay for the show if I have to. That's enough, right?

204
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,480
It's not just about money.

205
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,060
They even said that if we should send you to a mental institution.

206
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:55,060
They questioned how we could let a girl who isn't in her right mind to take over this big foundation and the ballet theatre?

207
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,650
I made...

208
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:00,010
one mistake one day.

209
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:05,180
Or it could be a trap someone set up.

210
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,490
There you go again.

211
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:13,600
Who on earth would set up this meticulous trap and go to all that trouble just to kick you out?

212
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:16,430
Oh, right.

213
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:21,020
The ballet theatre will go on a strike. They can't perform with a girl like you.

214
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:24,870
You understand that, right? Don't live in your memories like an old lady, Yeon Seo.

215
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:30,140
You're not the same Yeon Seo. No one is welcoming you back.

216
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,260
Did you get that?

217
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,530
Excuse me, ma'am!

218
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:35,320
Oh, that scared me.

219
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,340
Did you just yell at me?

220
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:42,440
There's a saying. "Throw out every kind or shape of evil."

221
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:46,930
"Greed gives birth to sin. When it's full-grown, it gives birth to death."

222
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,780
Hey. Kim Dan. What's the matter with you?

223
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,900
What's going on here? Have you both gone crazy?

224
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,550
I understand that you might get carried away. I know that the temptation is strong,

225
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:59,130
but you're the only family Yeon Seo has.

226
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:02,770
Why don't you cherish her? Why don't you love her?

227
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:09,020
How could you treat her no better than a stranger? Why do you hurt her like this? Why?

228
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,990
You're surely blessed with having a loyal secretary. Mr. Jo and this guy now.

229
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:21,170
They'll do anything for you. You must feel reassured without your family.

230
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,130
Leave now. Don't ever come to see me.

231
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,190
I'll give you 12 hours. Resign on your own.

232
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:37,960
If you continue to be stubborn, all the sponsors will leave.

233
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,320
And once the reputation of Fantasia is ruined, this foundation your parents established

234
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,590
will vanish into thin air.

235
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:50,730
And the only person to stop that from happening is me, Choi Yeong Ja.

236
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,560
Keep that in mind.

237
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,530
Thank you for the juice.

238
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,880
It's almost ready.

239
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,080
After you drink this, don't think about anything and just get some sleep.

240
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,100
Let's go upstairs.

241
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:15,400
♫  The little things you do  ♫

242
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,900
What are you doing?

243
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,250
No, stop drinking.

244
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:22,640
Who do you think you are?

245
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:28,640
Don't be such a fool. You went through so much yesterday. What are you doing?

246
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,030
You requested a blood test.

247
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:33,400
- When we get the result— 
- It'll be useless.

248
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:37,630
I'm sure someone put a stimulant in somewhere.

249
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:41,980
But alcohol and sedatives were found in your blood, too.
   

250
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:45,070
Did you take any medications?

251
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:50,110
Everything is mixed up, so they aren't sure if it could be used as evidence.

252
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:55,280
They can't find out if I had was poison, medication, or alcohol,

253
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:59,220
or who did it to me.

254
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,150
I might really have gone crazy.

255
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,590
It's all my fault.

256
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:07,490
I was going to keep my eyes open. I wanted to make sure that I protect you.

257
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,190
It's my fault.

258
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:11,000
No.

259
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,360
You said greed gives birth to sin.

260
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,120
♫  ...without my grant  ♫

261
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,330
I guess it was greed for me to wish...

262
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:20,650
♫  ...down here  ♫

263
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:22,930
...to do ballet again.

264
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,370
No.

265
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:30,870
It isn't.

266
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,960
My first audience said

267
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,790
that my dance was the prettiest thing he had ever seen in his life.

268
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:42,620
A kid who didn't know what ballet was became touched and cried.

269
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,720
 I know. 

270
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,230
 I felt that way, too. 

271
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:51,280
I was so happy back then.

272
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:58,290
He helped me realize that I'm happy when I dance.

273
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:03,390
But I forgot that for such a long time.

274
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:05,890
I finally...

275
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:09,410
found my goal again.

276
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:10,530
♫  I'd gladly give this life  ♫

277
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:13,850
But...

278
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:17,420
it's too tough.

279
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,470
It's tough.

280
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,030
♫  to be  ♫

281
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,360
♫  with you  ♫

282
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,010
Miss,

283
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:51,840
can't you just give up on everything?

284
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:56,500
I hate to see you suffer.

285
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:03,570
You don't have to keep dancing for Fantasia.

286
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:11,030
If you need an audience to dance, I will watch you.

287
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:18,580
Should I?

288
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:26,290
Should I give up on everything, only show my dance to you

289
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:29,560
and live with you forever?

290
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:38,750
Okay.

291
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:48,080
I will give you my first performance.

292
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:53,280
This piece is called "Giselle."

293
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,810
It's you.

294
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,630
Kim Dan.

295
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:01,750
Yes, Miss?

296
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:06,990
Why do you always save me?

297
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:15,480
You save me and help me out.

298
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,460
But why don't you like me?

299
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:26,190
Figures. No one in this world likes me.

300
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,060
I don't care about it.

301
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:35,690
But it's not okay for you...

302
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,790
to not like me.

303
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:42,460
I hate it. It's frustrating.

304
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:49,260
You said I'm good. You said I'm pretty.

305
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:52,100
But...

306
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:56,750
But why don't you like me?

307
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:59,510
How can you not like me?

308
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,690
Kim Dan.

309
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:13,780
♫  When a cold wind touches  ♫

310
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:17,620
♫  The window in my room  ♫

311
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:24,250
♫  I think of you who came to me softly  ♫

312
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,330
♫  As you knocked on the door of my heart little by little,  ♫

313
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:35,080
♫  Maybe by that time  ♫

314
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:40,680
♫  I might have realized   ♫

315
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:44,630
♫  That from that point on, every night   ♫

316
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:47,960
I...

317
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,940
shouldn't fall for you.

318
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,710
And I...

319
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:55,220
♫  My mind will be filled  ♫

320
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:58,240
can't stay by your side forever.

321
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,760
That really breaks my heart.

322
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:07,930
Lee Yeon Seo, how can I...

323
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:09,560
♫  I feel infatuated?  ♫

324
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,120
...not like you?

325
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:15,520
♫  Will you know it?  ♫

326
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,590
♫  On a night when cherry blossoms are scattering,  ♫

327
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:23,370
♫  Through the warm wind  ♫

328
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:26,770
♫  under the moonlight, I long for you all alone  ♫

329
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:29,700
 Don't go. 

330
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:33,390
 Don't go. 

331
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,730
 How do you really feel? 

332
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:39,420
 Are you worried that Rib isn't the real love for Yeon Seo, 

333
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:42,960
 or are you wishing that he isn't the real one? 

334
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:50,400
♫  I think of you who came to me softly  ♫

335
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,110
♫  little by little  ♫

336
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:54,980
I'm in huge trouble, aren't I?

337
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:57,660
What's wrong?

338
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:00,890
No, what's with you?

339
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:01,810
Let go of me.

340
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:03,320
You can't run away!

341
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:06,200
Tell me you'll disappear from Yeon Seo's life now.

342
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,330
What are you talking about?

343
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:08,940
I warned you, didn't I?

344
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,520
That I won't let you live if you interfere.

345
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:15,040
Who do you think you are to tell her to give up on dancing?!

346
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:18,280
I said, let go!

347
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:46,660


348
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,450
♫  You are my angel  ♫

349
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:56,620
♫  Oh you are my angel, always  ♫

350
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:00,690
♫  You're here  ♫

351
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:05,900
♫  Oh you are my angel  ♫

352
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,430
♫  You are by my side  ♫

353
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:12,140
   

354
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:13,640
 You promised me 

355
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:16,360
 that whatever you do, you'll do it to make Yeon Seo happy. 

356
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,840
 What's with me? He really gets on my nerves. 

357
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,720
 Hey, what are you doing? 

358
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,530
 No matter what you choose to do, you're no longer alone. 

359
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:24,960
♫  Even if our love can't come true  ♫

360
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,430
 I'll make sure you like me, to love me. 

361
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:29,220
 I'll do it. 

362
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,680
♫  Leave everything to me  ♫

363
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,410
 What are you doing to Yeon Seo? 

364
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:37,720
 Kim Dan. No, Angel Dan. 

365
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,200
 Why are you here? 

366
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,632
♫  write a new fate for us  ♫
