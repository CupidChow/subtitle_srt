1
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:49,215
If angels can regret,

2
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,305
my only regret would be

3
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,348
that day.

4
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,147
09M 2904

5
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:54,405
I shouldn't

6
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,491
have done that.

7
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:22,934
I shouldn't have

8
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:24,561
saved her.

9
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,397
I was not

10
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,024
supposed to do that.

11
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:46,541
No.

12
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:48,501
Please!

13
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,003
Darn it!

14
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:52,547
You're late.

15
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,305
I gave you my final warning.

16
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,692
Hello, there's been a car accident.

17
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:16,070
I'm on Route Eight
heading towards Yangpyeong.

18
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,280
Please hurry.

19
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:26,915
Mr. Cho...

20
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,627
Please answer me.

21
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,588
I'm scared.

22
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,303
Who are you?

23
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,431
You're okay now. Everything is okay.

24
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,184
I'm here.

25
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,315
Ms. Lee Yeon-seo.

26
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,404
This is the place

27
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:42,365
where I'll be

28
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:44,575
dissipated like smoke

29
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,122
and dust.

30
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,967
Listen up, Angel Dan.

31
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,197
"Angels are mere messengers of the deity.

32
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:26,492
You were to remain absolutely uninvolved.

33
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:30,163
Angel Dan, you often blurred the lines

34
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,457
and overstepped your boundaries.

35
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,543
However, I had hoped that you'd learn

36
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,378
to do good.

37
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,840
Despite my hope,

38
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:43,426
you have gotten yourself
involved in human life.

39
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,726
It is only just to punish the angel
by dissipation immediately.

40
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:56,439
Therefore, Angel Dan

41
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,941
will disappear now."

42
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,753
What are you doing?

43
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,435
I haven't been dissipated?

44
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,063
How?

45
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:38,439
But...

46
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:40,358
Why?

47
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,360
Starting now,

48
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,445
you won't be Angel Dan.

49
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:47,323
You will be a human named Kim Dan.

50
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,409
This is your final last chance.

51
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,663
Transform into a human
and execute a special mission.

52
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,208
Hu!

53
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,752
There's a flood of prayers thanking you
for protecting the animals

54
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:02,797
and the people you helped which was
technically considered insubordination.

55
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:06,008
I'm not sure if I should be
commending you for your actions

56
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,719
or if I should punish you
for creating such a big mess.

57
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,389
I have no idea what to do with you, moron.

58
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:14,475
Thank you.

59
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:16,436
Thank you so much!

60
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,562
You have 100 days.

61
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,522
And I barely managed
to get you those 100 days.

62
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,525
You must successfully
carry out a mission for 100 days

63
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:24,652
for the door to reopen.

64
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,696
You cannot take more than 100 days.

65
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:27,822
I'll do whatever it takes.

66
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,740
If you ask me to move a mountain

67
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,326
or move around oceans,
it won't be a problem.

68
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,246
If you ask me to count the feathers
of every bird in this world, I'll do it.

69
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,540
What is my mission?

70
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,131
Love.

71
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:25,546
You want me to find love?

72
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,132
To whom?

73
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,139
It's hurting my eyes.

74
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,316
What? A shadow?

75
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,077
I'm sorry.

76
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:03,876
It's all right.

77
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,003
You're a nice person.

78
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:10,800
A person?

79
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:13,636
That's right.

80
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:15,680
I'm a human now.

81
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,275
GILDAM HOSPITAL
ROOM 502

82
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,776
Love? That's a piece of cake.

83
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:30,945
I'll find it.

84
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,614
I'll make it a full package
with faith and hope.

85
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,533
I got you covered!

86
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:37,785
Yes.

87
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:53,134
How is it? Can you see?

88
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,637
The sunset...

89
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,015
It's pretty, right?

90
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,434
The universe must have given us one

91
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,269
to celebrate regaining your eyesight.

92
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,273
The sunset glow is very beautiful.

93
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:09,817
It's very beautiful.

94
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,238
Yeon-seo. Yeon-seo, hold tight!

95
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,865
What is it? What's going on?

96
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,208
Yeon-seo, are you okay? Yeon-seo.

97
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,418
Oh, no.

98
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,836
Let's lie down, okay?

99
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:41,265
But why are you

100
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,060
wearing a black outfit?

101
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,944
What about Mr. Cho?

102
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,906
Bring Mr. Cho to me!

103
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,411
She's going completely insane.

104
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,039
Honey, you're being too
harsh on the sick girl.

105
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,208
"Too harsh"? Me?

106
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,044
Look at how she's treating us.

107
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,588
How could she treat us like this

108
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:14,382
unless she still looks down on us?

109
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:15,800
Let's be honest.

110
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,426
We didn't kill Mr. Cho.

111
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:19,595
Did I kill him?

112
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,265
I'm the one who was shocked
by the cornea donation.

113
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:24,558
Honey.

114
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,685
Let's go. We fulfilled our duties.

115
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,604
Go without me.

116
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,649
I will stay with Yeon-seo today.

117
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:32,983
Will you?

118
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,360
No way.

119
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:35,861
Come home with us now.

120
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:39,532
Why would you stay with her when
she humiliated you like that at the party?

121
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,660
I can understand her.

122
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,870
Everything must be confusing
and scary for her.

123
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:47,873
The fact that she can see again
and that Mr. Cho passed away.

124
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,127
I would've passed out if I were her.

125
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:55,131
So we should give her time to accept this.

126
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:58,050
I asked the staff to
take good care of her.

127
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,218
Don't worry too much.

128
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:07,226
I don't know how
I gave birth to such a softy.

129
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,646
She takes after me, so she's softhearted.

130
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,108
You should go home first.

131
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:15,943
I'll stay at the funeral a bit longer.

132
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:16,902
Why?

133
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,612
You already paid your respect earlier.

134
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,906
He has no family, you know.

135
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,577
He's too softhearted.

136
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:29,957
GILDAM HOSPITAL

137
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,045
GILDAM HOSPITAL
ROOM 502

138
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,590
"Room 502."

139
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,313
I need to see it for myself.

140
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,024
I won't believe it until I see it.

141
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,151
I refuse to believe it.

142
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,699
Room 502.

143
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:37,525
What was that?

144
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,877
Goodness.

145
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:57,962
My gosh.

146
00:13:58,212 --> 00:13:59,505
You're here.

147
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:05,177
Mr. Park, why are you drinking like that?
You're drinking as if there's no end.

148
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:06,595
Don't drink too much.

149
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,472
I remember everything so vividly.

150
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,601
That kind hearted man

151
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:16,480
greeted me with a big smile on his face

152
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:17,898
every time he saw me.

153
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,651
And saying that he can't
let me leave empty-handed,

154
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:25,030
he always gave me a ton
of fruit and cookies.

155
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,742
My fridge is still filled
with those things.

156
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:31,996
Goodness.

157
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,624
We can't blame anyone.
Everyone dies eventually.

158
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,212
That kind hearted man did a good deed,

159
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,631
so I'm sure

160
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,092
he's in a good place now.

161
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,511
-Let's always remember him.
-Okay.

162
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,640
I'll remember everything,

163
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,851
so you can forget everything now.

164
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,855
The scary, cruel things
that you experienced

165
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,026
and the times when you were wronged.

166
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,111
Forget everything and rest in peace.

167
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:07,698
"Wronged"?

168
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,159
What do you mean by that, Mr. Park?

169
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,467
I feel so bad

170
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,802
about what happened with Mr. Cho.

171
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,179
He was used.

172
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,598
She and her dad treated
him like their slave,

173
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,183
and he even gave his cornea.

174
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:35,809
Have you guys heard the rumor?

175
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:38,729
It's possible

176
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,731
that someone caused
the accident on purpose.

177
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,191
My gosh! That's crazy.

178
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,692
-But who?
-And for what?

179
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,069
That I don't know.

180
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,947
But he had gotten all the tests done

181
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,823
and even selected a recipient in advance,

182
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,368
and I heard Lee Yeon-seo knew about it.

183
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,579
-No way.
-That can't be true.

184
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,165
Just like how light follows darkness

185
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,668
and how good and evil coexist,

186
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,211
life can't exist

187
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,213
without death.

188
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,048
May he

189
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:49,967
rest in peace.

190
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,470
I'm sorry I'm late, Mr. Cho.

191
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,181
I want to see you smile

192
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:42,770
and shine brightly like you did then
just one more time.

193
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:47,816
What is she doing?

194
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:50,778
-Is she crazy?
-What's wrong with her?

195
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:52,654
-She's weird.
-What's with her?

196
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:37,074
Lee Yeon-seo in Room 502
was last seen at the mortuary.

197
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:40,327
Room 502?

198
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,163
I heard she was smiling at the mortuary.

199
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,248
She couldn't have gone far.

200
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:45,499
I'll look for her.

201
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,710
"Gildam Hospital. Room 502."

202
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:51,964
Lee Yeon-seo?

203
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:19,867
What's the room number?

204
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,493
Room 502?

205
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:23,787
How did the surgery go?

206
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,539
It went well, right?

207
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,002
All right, thanks.

208
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,222
Where to, miss?

209
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:47,936
Please...

210
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,230
take me home.

211
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,698
THE 1999 ELENA BALLET SCHOOL RECITAL
YEON-SEO AT AGE 6

212
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:06,033
THE 117TH VISION BALLET COMPETITION

213
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:25,135
How did I do?

214
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:26,762
You did an excellent job.

215
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:30,057
Yeon-seo, you were...

216
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,812
Hey, come here.

217
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,147
All right.

218
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,983
The man I only trust
in the world, Seung-hwan.

219
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,234
Surprise!

220
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,987
Yeon-seo, when I'm not around,

221
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:46,615
Mr. Cho is like your dad. Okay?

222
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,617
No way. You're my dad,

223
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,202
and Mr. Cho is Mr. Cho.

224
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,453
Really?

225
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:55,540
He's Mr. Cho, whom I love
the most in this world.

226
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,084
Here

227
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:58,585
I go!

228
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,347
If you give me just a little more time,

229
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:12,808
I will bring you back to your place.

230
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:14,059
How?

231
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,186
Are you going to give me eyes?

232
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:17,270
Yeon-seo.

233
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,731
Bring me back? Where? Who says you can?
Who do you think you are?

234
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:21,358
If you act like my dad once again,

235
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,652
I will really fire you.

236
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,449
How dare you give me your eyes?

237
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,244
Who told you to pass away?

238
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,163
Who told you that you can?

239
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:37,666
Who said that?

240
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:42,170
Who said you can leave me
and go away by yourself?

241
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:07,612
What is this?

242
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,698
Hu. Open the door, Hu.

243
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,868
You can't do this to me.
This is not right.

244
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:16,288
She smiled like this
at the funeral portrait of the donor

245
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,748
of her corneas!

246
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:20,625
She was always cold-blooded,

247
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,210
and she isn't normal right now either.

248
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,171
How can someone like her love?

249
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:25,839
I want to change the mission.

250
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,008
Give me a new mission!

251
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:29,634
Hey! Come on!

252
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,449
Hello, sir.

253
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:54,576
Are you here for the morning prayer?

254
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:56,870
Oh, yes. Right.

255
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:02,167
You look like a homeless person.

256
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:05,545
Hey.

257
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:08,757
What?

258
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,596
Goodness.

259
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:16,681
Goodness.

260
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,184
Humans will die early

261
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,353
if they sleep somewhere cold.

262
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,483
Are you also here

263
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:29,569
in a human figure too?
On a special mission?

264
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,738
This is a piece of cake
with my experience.

265
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:34,824
Gosh. I'm jealous.

266
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,243
You need all the time that you have.

267
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:37,619
Why are you just sitting here?

268
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:40,705
I mean,

269
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:44,292
think of this in a humanistic way.

270
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:45,835
Okay.

271
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,630
There was this person who was ill-natured.

272
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,131
On top of that,

273
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,967
she became more vicious
because she went blind.

274
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,593
One day, she almost died
and woke up again,

275
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:54,678
and she could see again.

276
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,763
She must be grateful.

277
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,348
The world must look rosy to her.

278
00:25:58,431 --> 00:25:59,391
You would think so, right?

279
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:01,726
But her donor was a man
who always stood by her side,

280
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,479
and someone
that she always treated harshly.

281
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:08,900
In that case, how would you feel
as a human?

282
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,027
As a human?

283
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,616
Even so, wouldn't you still be grateful?

284
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:19,786
-Why?
-It'll drive you crazy.

285
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:21,746
Humans can go crazy.

286
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,541
I thought about it,
and that must be why she smiled like that.

287
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:26,251
No. No way.

288
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:27,836
She's emotionally unavailable.

289
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,005
She's emotionally unavailable
that I can't get her to love.

290
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,881
I can't. Impossible. I can't do this.

291
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,800
Then you should give up now

292
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:35,010
and turn to dust.

293
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,555
Why does it have to be her? Why?

294
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:40,682
Why did you have to save her, then?

295
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:41,808
That's because...

296
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:52,736
Lastly,

297
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,322
shine brightly.

298
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:57,907
What?

299
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:02,829
What is this?

300
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:05,415
Hey, Hu.

301
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:08,251
Hu.

302
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:09,627
Hu?

303
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:26,061
Ms. Lee.

304
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:28,438
Ms. Lee.

305
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,237
We said our last goodbyes to Mr. Cho

306
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:37,906
earlier this morning.

307
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:40,700
What?

308
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,828
Were you doing this all night long?

309
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:45,747
Yes.

310
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:49,834
What about your eye drops?

311
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:51,586
Did you put them in?

312
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:53,588
Of course, you didn't.

313
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,048
Because I had it.

314
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,427
What are you doing?

315
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:01,262
No, what are you doing?

316
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:06,393
Those are Mr. Cho's eyes.

317
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:08,853
I don't care if you starve, get sick,

318
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,230
get sleep, or don't get any sleep.

319
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:11,481
That's up to you.

320
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:12,816
But not your eyes.

321
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:14,484
You got them from Mr. Cho.

322
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,321
I never asked him for them.

323
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,989
Then you can take them back out.

324
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,084
What I am trying to say
is that there is no one who will

325
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,585
take your whining anymore.

326
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,712
You probably don't know,

327
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:37,090
but Mr. Cho was special to all of us.

328
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:38,883
Not only did he celebrate our birthdays,

329
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,468
he even celebrated
our families' birthdays.

330
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:42,929
If you got the eyes from someone like him,

331
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:44,472
then don't let them go to waste.

332
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:45,807
I ask of you.

333
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,058
If you liked him that much,

334
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,935
why didn't you treat him
better when he was here?

335
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:53,064
You slacked off because Mr. Cho was here.

336
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,525
All the other employees made Mr. Cho do

337
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:57,068
all the tough and tedious work.

338
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,446
And now you're getting angry?

339
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,494
Thanks for the speech.

340
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,291
That really resonated in my heart.

341
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:14,878
Have you forgotten?

342
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:17,797
His tough and tedious work was you.

343
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,050
Fine, you can mock me all you want.

344
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:23,094
That suits you the best.

345
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:39,694
What's wrong?

346
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:45,742
I can't go.

347
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,081
I know this place.

348
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,543
I can see everything.

349
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,004
But my legs...

350
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,132
My legs won't move.

351
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,515
A psychological trauma?

352
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,517
People usually suffer from this
when they lose someone

353
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,684
who was the closest to them.

354
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:13,645
They cannot do anything

355
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:14,979
that they did with that person.

356
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:17,524
A husband that lost his wife

357
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,067
who played bowling with him every Sunday,

358
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,402
has dry heaves whenever
he sees bowling pins,

359
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,154
and even has panic attacks.

360
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,658
The closer they are,
the more severe the symptom is.

361
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:28,701
You should get hospitalized again.

362
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,829
It only has been a few days
since the accident.

363
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,414
You can see things when you become weak.

364
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,208
I talked to her doctor.

365
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,126
Her inflammation level and leukocyte count

366
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,545
all look normal.

367
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,630
She can get discharged and rest at home

368
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,215
to fully recover soon.

369
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,217
So my heart is the problem?

370
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:48,721
I can't do the things

371
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,391
that I did with him?

372
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:54,978
I

373
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:57,730
did everything with him.

374
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:59,649
I walked, ran, and ate with him.

375
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:00,984
Everything.

376
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,654
And I can't do

377
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:07,532
any of that now?

378
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,284
Although...

379
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,704
Although I can see now?

380
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,147
Too fast.

381
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,234
Who are you?

382
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:44,903
You're 16th note faster.

383
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,363
If you die, get sad,

384
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,324
and fall in love before the music,

385
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,618
it's rushed and kills the expectations.

386
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:52,952
I asked you who you are.

387
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:54,495
Corps de ballet.

388
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:56,581
Your backs aren't straight.

389
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:58,499
You need to get tensed up!

390
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:01,169
Dancers express their emotions
with their backs.

391
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,170
Isn't this basic?

392
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:03,671
One dancer with loose muscles

393
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,757
is enough to ruin the whole
atmosphere of the performance.

394
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:09,260
-Do you not know that?
-Hey, hey.

395
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:14,182
Swan Lake.

396
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,227
A happy ending?

397
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:21,397
Is this intended for kids?

398
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,525
I apologize for my late introduction.

399
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:26,444
I'm a newly appointed artistic director.

400
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:27,779
My name is Ji Kang-woo.

401
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:30,490
Director Ji Kang-woo.

402
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,661
I'm Keum Ru-na, the Associate Director.

403
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:38,623
Assemble everyone within 30 minutes.

404
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:42,085
Aren't you tired of doing
the same performance for three years?

405
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:43,378
Your program is stuck in a rut.

406
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:46,005
You only perform these predictable shows
for the sake of your popularity.

407
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:49,092
Can you call yourself
the best ballet company?

408
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,469
Have you watched our show in person?

409
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:55,306
Our dance and music might not be

410
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,808
perfectly synced in a video.

411
00:32:56,891 --> 00:33:00,061
We all do our best on stage.

412
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,105
If that's your best, you're in trouble.

413
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,482
I saw your show in person
with my own eyes.

414
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,235
The performance for the 20th anniversary.

415
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,368
You must practice more, Ni-na.

416
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,203
Even if you split
the music into 32nd notes,

417
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:18,705
instead of 16th notes,

418
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,289
I'm confident that I'll stay on the beat.

419
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:21,457
You're ahead of the music.

420
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,460
I'm sure the critics who are sponsored

421
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:25,878
by Fantasia never mentioned that.

422
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,130
You should check it now.

423
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:28,214
Next time.

424
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:31,259
Right now,
I'm discussing the future of Fantasia.

425
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:33,052
-Play the music.
-This year,

426
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,555
we won't be performing Swan Lake.

427
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,307
-What?
-We're not doing that?

428
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:40,768
-Seriously?
-But we practiced.

429
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:43,730
We've already released
the schedule for the year.

430
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,690
We will do a new show
on the scheduled dates.

431
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:48,901
Artistic merits, popularity, tradition,
and originality. We'll cover it all.

432
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:51,821
This will be a new kind of Giselle
no one has ever seen before.

433
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,031
-Giselle?
-Giselle?

434
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:55,950
And the main ballerina for the performance

435
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:00,413
is Lee Yeon-seo.

436
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,379
Who gave you the right
to change the program

437
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:11,424
and to select the main ballerina?

438
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,676
This is my turf.

439
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,386
And only one dancer
will be the main ballerina.

440
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,971
And that dancer is Keum Ni-na.

441
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:20,558
Everyone, why are you just standing there?

442
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:21,851
You should go and practice.

443
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:24,020
Come with me.

444
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:27,857
Come with me.

445
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:30,693
I told you to come with me!

446
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:32,779
You must practice! You must!

447
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:34,530
Hey, Keum Ni-na.

448
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:36,407
Shouldn't you at least follow me?

449
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:37,492
I raised you.

450
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:50,797
What a bold introduction!

451
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,675
You should have given me a heads-up.

452
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:56,803
I was very surprised.

453
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,850
Let me introduce him officially.

454
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:06,020
He will join Fantasia
as a new member today.

455
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,731
He's Director Ji Kang-woo.

456
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:19,992
I will let this one slide today.

457
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,620
I want you to stop putting
on these kinds of

458
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:23,913
rash acts from now on.

459
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:26,124
Well, the situation is very serious.

460
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:31,420
What you said
about Lee Yeon-seo earlier...

461
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:32,880
You're not serious, are you?

462
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:33,965
No, I was serious.

463
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:36,968
Let me make myself very clear.

464
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:40,346
I, Choi Yeong-ja, am the one
who hired you, Director Ji.

465
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:41,722
Let me make myself very clear too.

466
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,392
The contract dictates that I have
complete control over the program

467
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:46,269
and the appointment of dancers.

468
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:48,896
Only after discussing it with me.

469
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:50,648
That will be impossible.

470
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:53,192
If ballerinas rest for a day,
they feel the effect.

471
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:54,986
If they rest for two,
their partners feel it.

472
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:57,071
And if they rest for four days,
the audience will see it.

473
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:59,657
Yeon-seo hasn't danced for three years.

474
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:02,243
She can't do a fouetté
because she can see now.

475
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:03,786
I was going to make her do it

476
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,955
even when she was blind.

477
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,498
As long as she agrees,

478
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,458
it won't take long
for her to get in shape.

479
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:11,752
She's truly a talented dancer,

480
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,421
so help me persuade her.

481
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:15,840
Her aunt

482
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:17,884
and her cousin

483
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:20,511
should do so with all of their hearts.

484
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:26,017
I knew it.

485
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,060
You don't want to do it
because your sister

486
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:29,395
will lose her spot.

487
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,689
No. I've made my decision

488
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:33,441
as the Associate Director of Fantasia.

489
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,902
I like your ambition,
but that won't happen.

490
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:38,821
If the prima ballerina's position becomes
vacant after overhauling our schedule,

491
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:39,947
we'll be a laughingstock.

492
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:43,659
And you will rightly be held
responsible for it.

493
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,037
I understand.

494
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:48,623
I'll do it myself.

495
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:51,584
Yeon-seo isn't easily persuaded.

496
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,127
It's no fun if she is.

497
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:03,804
BAEGUN-DONG
IVY MANSION

498
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,690
You're here for an interview, right?

499
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,401
Yes. I think so.

500
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,570
-Don't breathe loudly.
-What?

501
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,573
I just got fired for breathing too loudly.

502
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:27,536
She's so picky.

503
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,373
Hey, are you all right?

504
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:32,458
Yes, I am. Thank you. Goodbye.

505
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,543
-Thank you.
-Sure.

506
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:38,965
Thank you for your time.

507
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:55,022
You fired 20 people within 3 hours.

508
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,482
You're impressive indeed.

509
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:58,317
You know that wasting time
isn't how I roll.

510
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,735
You should at least test them.

511
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,737
You should try holding
their arms and stand up.

512
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,281
Can't you tell that they're all duds?

513
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,992
No matter how much they resemble him,

514
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:08,619
no one can be him.

515
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:09,996
The doctor said

516
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:12,832
that it might be better
if they had a similar vibe.

517
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:17,086
Some people use teddy bears
to replace the deceased.

518
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,339
Instead of fake teddy bears,

519
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:22,508
I'd rather have a rude butler like you.

520
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,386
-You're holding a grudge.
-Grudge? If I was,

521
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:26,804
I would've made you write an apology.

522
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:28,472
If you keep doing this,
you can't hire anyone.

523
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,766
Let's just hire a driver
and a secretary from the current staff.

524
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:31,976
No one applied for the position.

525
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:34,061
Even with the 200-percent bonus,
no one applied.

526
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:36,105
This is all thanks to
that temper of yours.

527
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,108
Then, keep looking.

528
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:41,527
You told me not to waste these eyes.

529
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:01,088
Hello. I'm Kim Dan, the interviewee.

530
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,299
We just finished with
the last interviewee.

531
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:05,509
I was told

532
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,011
to be at Ivy Mansion by 3 p.m.

533
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,016
KIM DAN

534
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:14,518
You're right. I do have your resume.

535
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:18,189
Mr. Kim Dan?

536
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:20,983
How could a man in his twenties be here?

537
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:29,033
Who was that guy?

538
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:30,534
That was upsetting.

539
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,792
Would you like to say anything
before we finish?

540
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,960
Please hire me.

541
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:43,130
I like your enthusiasm.

542
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,591
I'll assist her as best I can...

543
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,098
so that she could shine brightly.

544
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:55,893
I want to see you smile

545
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:57,561
and shine brightly

546
00:39:58,145 --> 00:39:59,605
like you did then

547
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:01,315
just one more time.

548
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,697
What did you just say?

549
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,785
Please. Please be effective.

550
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:16,455
Shine brightly.

551
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:24,171
Shine brightly.

552
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,090
You'll shine brightly and sparkle.

553
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:27,174
Stop.

554
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:33,639
That's enough. Leave.

555
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,185
Did I do something wrong?

556
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,937
If you tell me what I did--

557
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,522
Your interview is over, so leave.

558
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:44,775
I have no place to go
if I don't get this job.

559
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,110
My father kicked me out.

560
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:47,987
And my uncle won't even help me.

561
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,156
I'm all alone in this harsh world.

562
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:51,949
So what?

563
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,538
I was hoping you could help me.

564
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:18,058
I thought she would be dejected,
but she's still cranky.

565
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,436
They say you can't fix humans.

566
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:21,979
Gosh, that temper of hers.

567
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:23,772
Excuse me.

568
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:30,362
I just said that out loud, didn't I?

569
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:36,076
I totally forgot for a second.

570
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:41,123
Since you already heard it,
I'll say one more thing.

571
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:44,210
Be nice, okay?

572
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:46,629
Be shiny. Be nice!

573
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:54,678
What was that about?

574
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,808
Hey! Stop right there!

575
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:01,519
Ms. Lee!

576
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,104
You just

577
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:06,357
walked on your own, right?

578
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:18,118
Gosh, I'm in trouble now!

579
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,912
This is crazy. I guess
I really am a human now!

580
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:21,914
Should I go back and apologize?

581
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:22,915
But I don't want to.

582
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:24,875
Then I'll dissipate.
Gosh! I don't want that.

583
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,001
Yes.

584
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:27,628
I should go back, apologize to her,

585
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:28,963
and go to paradise.

586
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:31,840
Gosh! I don't think I can do this.

587
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:33,175
-What do I do?
-Mr. Kim Dan!

588
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,885
What should I do? I'm so torn!

589
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:42,977
All right.

590
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,480
Use this phone while on duty.
And put this next to your bed.

591
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,274
Whenever it rings,
you must run to Ms. Lee.

592
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:51,235
This is an alarm for when she's going out.
When it rings, run to where she is.

593
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:53,654
This is her baby journal
and this is a record of her ballet career.

594
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:55,155
This is a list of things that she hates,

595
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,949
and this is for the corneal transplant.

596
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:58,367
And most importantly,

597
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:00,286
here's your contract.

598
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:06,208
I have to go through all of these things?

599
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,418
Yes.

600
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:08,836
By the way,

601
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:10,462
where's your stuff?

602
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:12,256
Is this it?

603
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:16,093
You must be a terrible son.

604
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:18,012
I guess you got kicked out empty-handed.

605
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:22,683
I will return home eventually.

606
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:26,020
Well, then.

607
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:27,896
Thanks to you, I can call it a day.

608
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:29,064
Take it easy.

609
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:47,958
I got closer to her.

610
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,514
Mr. Kim Dan is all moved in now.

611
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:05,309
You may leave, then.

612
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:13,567
The exact opposite of Mr. Cho
could be better

613
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:16,195
than someone who is sort of
but not quite like him.

614
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:17,363
I don't believe it.

615
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:20,407
The spiel about the teddy bear and so on.

616
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:23,744
-I don't believe it.
-But earlier, you took--

617
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:25,204
That was it though.

618
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:27,790
It's all in my mind anyway,

619
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,500
so I should just overcome it.

620
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:33,003
I will do it on my own.

621
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:34,588
Then

622
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:37,883
why did you hire Mr. Kim?

623
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,561
LOVE

624
00:44:54,691 --> 00:44:56,110
What...

625
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:57,569
What's this sound?

626
00:44:57,694 --> 00:44:59,405
Gosh! Where's it coming from?

627
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,002
What can I do for you?

628
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:14,920
You're too slow.

629
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:17,131
You must show up within a minute.

630
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:28,142
Is it not the right side?

631
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:29,643
I read that you always stand

632
00:45:29,726 --> 00:45:32,062
on the right side,
so I should offer my left arm.

633
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:36,024
Gosh, don't.

634
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:38,193
Come on.

635
00:45:38,735 --> 00:45:40,320
Here, hold my arm.

636
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:58,464
Oh, look at you! You're walking!

637
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:04,303
You don't need to thank me.

638
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:07,055
Since this already happened,
you should try to recover quickly.

639
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:08,557
Then you'll feel better,

640
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,642
and with the gentle spring breeze--

641
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:11,727
Be quiet.

642
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:14,813
I hate the noise.

643
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:17,107
Just walk.

644
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:21,361
Where are you going?

645
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:36,460
You're so bad at this.

646
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,337
Why does a secretary
have to learn to do this?

647
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,671
Please teach him well.

648
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:42,174
His bones will break
if he and I have a match.

649
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,343
Teach him the pinning technique.

650
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:51,058
Tap!

651
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,101
I'm doomed.

652
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:56,730
There isn't a single ounce of love
in this woman.

653
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:06,323
Get out.

654
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:10,744
The corridor!

655
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,335
You call this cleaning?

656
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:21,296
Do better. Clean properly!

657
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:24,091
Were human beings really made

658
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,635
into the reflection of the deity?

659
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,100
You can't even add up
the calories correctly?

660
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:35,686
I won't eat this.

661
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:38,438
Then why is she so condescending

662
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:40,357
and rude?

663
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:45,529
Mr, they smell amazing.
Smell these flowers.

664
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:52,286
She doesn't know how to be impressed,

665
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:54,121
and she's incapable of being marveled.

666
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,873
There are 198 things
on her list of things she hates.

667
00:47:57,874 --> 00:48:00,919
No one in this mansion loves her.

668
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:03,422
That includes me.

669
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:08,218
But wait and see.

670
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:10,345
No matter what happens,

671
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:12,639
I will make

672
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:14,808
you learn to love.

673
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:18,163
As you know,
when I was the only principal dancer here,

674
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:20,123
Keum Ni-na was my understudy.

675
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:22,209
In other words, she was my shadow.

676
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:24,878
You're 16th note faster.

677
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:28,507
If you die, get sad,

678
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:30,676
and fall in love before the music,

679
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:33,303
it's rushed and kills the expectations.

680
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:44,940
I thought being rushed
was your only problem,

681
00:49:45,023 --> 00:49:46,233
but you're actually dumb.

682
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:01,873
Do you want to break your ankle?

683
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:05,210
You know what "next time" means
to ballerinas.

684
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,672
"I don't want to see your dance, ever.
You won't make it."

685
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:12,634
You don't want to give me another chance.

686
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:15,846
You've already made your decision.

687
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,433
When I say, "next time", I keep my word.

688
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:20,600
I don't sugarcoat things.

689
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:47,878
I'm back.

690
00:50:58,013 --> 00:50:59,556
PRINCIPAL DANCER
OF FANTASIA BALLET THEATER

691
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:00,974
KEUM KI-CHUN, CHOI YEONG-JA, MARRIED

692
00:51:01,057 --> 00:51:02,476
KEUM RU-NA, ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR

693
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:05,771
KEUM NI-NA, PRINCIPAL DANCER

694
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:10,650
LEE YEON-SEO, REGAINED HER EYESIGHT

695
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:17,783
How's she doing?

696
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:19,618
She still can't walk?

697
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:23,079
She can move around now

698
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:24,706
after she hired a new secretary?

699
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:33,673
Then should I

700
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:35,801
get started now?

701
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:43,809
Don't worry about it.

702
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:46,394
Yeon-seo just got surgery.

703
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,688
And she took three years off.

704
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:50,482
It won't be easy for her to return.

705
00:51:51,107 --> 00:51:52,359
That surgery!

706
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:57,989
How did you manage it so that she could
receive corneas after a car accident?

707
00:51:58,698 --> 00:52:00,742
I had no idea that Mr. Cho designated her

708
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:02,035
as the receiver.

709
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:05,956
You know that I tried to stop her
from receiving it

710
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:07,332
whenever there was one available.

711
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:08,750
The biter is bitten.

712
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:10,919
My gosh.

713
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:12,629
The minister is also giving me pressure

714
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:14,089
with her regaining eyesight.

715
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:17,092
I mean, what if she asks
for the foundation

716
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:19,803
because she can see now?

717
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:21,972
We should give it back.
It was originally hers.

718
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,268
You idiot.

719
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:28,895
You can go back to that life of debt

720
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:31,773
and suffer from having to
walk on eggshells around others.

721
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:33,525
But as for me,

722
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,402
I am not going back to that life.

723
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:42,909
Did you check?

724
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:46,621
I'm sure you'll find something.

725
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:48,748
What?

726
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:51,835
His things are still there?

727
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,553
Then we should clean it out for her.

728
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:06,725
Hey!

729
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:15,775
Who's in charge of the garden today?

730
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:19,112
I just stepped on wet petals, slipped,

731
00:53:19,195 --> 00:53:21,031
and almost cracked my head open.

732
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:22,073
Who was in charge?

733
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:26,995
-You should stop.
-Don't get into this.

734
00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:28,538
I'll clean up the garden.

735
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:30,665
I'll pick up every single petal left here.

736
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:31,666
Happy?

737
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:35,170
You can go back.

738
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:37,923
Do not go back.

739
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:44,721
This is beyond your power.

740
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:46,473
Do you want me to read over the contract?

741
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:48,433
I haven't signed it yet anyway.

742
00:53:48,516 --> 00:53:50,143
While we're on it,
should we look into the laws

743
00:53:50,226 --> 00:53:51,603
on the overuse of power by an employer?

744
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:53,730
I'll go into every single detail on that.

745
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:57,567
Go back inside. Come on, go back.

746
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,070
Yes, go.

747
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:03,031
You!

748
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:08,495
You hate the sunset, don't you?

749
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:11,915
-What?
-You always throw a fit during the sunset.

750
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:14,626
What is it? Were you dumped at sunset?

751
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:17,879
Did you see your first love
having an affair under the red sky?

752
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:19,047
What is it?

753
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:21,800
Yes, the sunset always drives me crazy.

754
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,635
I want to burn anyone that I see

755
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:25,136
with the burning sun.

756
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:26,221
Happy now?

757
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:29,307
If you know better, why do you do that?

758
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:32,602
They say you get over someone
you've loved with someone new.

759
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:34,938
Why don't you meet someone great

760
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:37,607
before you go crazier?

761
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:40,568
There is this saying too.

762
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:42,612
"Even if we speak
with the tongues of angels,

763
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:43,989
even if we gain all the world
and its knowledge,

764
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:45,740
even if we sacrifice ourselves,

765
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:46,950
without love,

766
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:48,827
we have nothing."

767
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:52,580
Come to think of it, I regret

768
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:55,250
I didn't ask about your religion
in the interview.

769
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:58,837
Make sure this place is spotless.

770
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:27,490
Excuse me. I'll take this one.

771
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:45,759
"Tongues of angels"?

772
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:50,180
That phony religious jerk.

773
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:52,348
You're neither a pervert nor a pickpocket.

774
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:53,975
You're from some religious cult?

775
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:55,685
Not everyone behaves like you

776
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:57,353
after experiencing a tragedy.

777
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:00,190
Could it be?

778
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:16,247
This rain is exactly like Lee Yeon-seo.

779
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:19,417
No matter how much I sweep,
this rain is making more petals fall down.

780
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:21,586
In a word, it's useless.

781
00:56:21,669 --> 00:56:22,921
It's all in vain.

782
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:24,923
I mean,

783
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:27,342
she has nothing I can work with.

784
00:56:28,009 --> 00:56:30,345
If she likes something,
I can start with that.

785
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,139
Her soul is like Sodom and Gomorrah.

786
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:54,035
What? Why are these out?

787
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:56,246
What is this?

788
00:56:57,956 --> 00:56:59,124
What's going on?

789
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:01,334
What is this?

790
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:06,714
Gosh.

791
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:08,424
NOISY GONG

792
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:09,926
Darn it.

793
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:13,888
KIM DAN

794
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:42,876
She's gone.

795
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:22,207
Gosh, darn it.

796
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:25,877
Dismissed. Begone.

797
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:28,171
My gosh, this is driving me crazy.

798
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:31,925
This is an emergency. I need this fixed.
This body is malfunctioning.

799
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:33,384
My gosh. Seriously.

800
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:44,729
Lee Yeon-seo.

801
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:46,940
Oh, gosh, no.

802
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:05,291
My goodness.

803
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:18,555
No, please. No.

804
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:10,643
Humans...

805
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:13,187
I especially have no idea
what Lee Yeon-seo is like.

806
01:02:13,354 --> 01:02:14,272
Now, one, two, three.

807
01:02:14,355 --> 01:02:15,440
Hey, that hurts.

808
01:02:15,523 --> 01:02:16,566
He's a pervert and a lunatic.

809
01:02:16,649 --> 01:02:19,318
I don't know if she ever liked anyone
or if there is someone

810
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:21,154
who makes her happy just
with the thought of them.

811
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:24,240
I actually want to see it badly too.

812
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:27,618
What should I do to make
Lee Yeon-seo's heart beat again?

813
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:29,203
I began to have hope

814
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:30,455
in you.

815
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:31,873
Gosh, that burns.

816
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:34,709
I will help you.

817
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:37,587
Someone who exists just for you.
