1
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,992
Ｗe all thought that

2
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:28,094
Quantum technology

3
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:30,530
is going to change the world around us.

4
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:46,646
But, in fact,

5
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:49,916
What quantum technology changed

6
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:52,819
is not the world

7
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:57,424
But us humans ourselves.

8
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,771
Clone DNA information.

9
00:01:32,158 --> 00:01:33,660
The truth is, Black and White

10
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,929
Have long been developing humanity and emotions.

11
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:40,600
How can AI have emotions?

12
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,336
No one can prove that others don't have emotions.

13
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:44,070
All we can do is measure

14
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,972
a bunch of electronic signals

15
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:46,873
But Black and White,

16
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:49,175
they can receive and transmit these signals.

17
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:51,311
Those are just electronic signals,

18
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:52,612
they're not real.

19
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,380
Then what is real?

20
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,682
Love is real-

21
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:56,883
No

22
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,987
This, this is real.

23
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:05,325
But White said, from the perspective of quantum science,

24
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:07,327
only the world of information is real.

25
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:10,029
Matter is just a projection of information

26
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:12,098
He wasn't wrong, was he?

27
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:14,901
They're robots, you're human.

28
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:16,870
Don't apply his logic to yourself.

29
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,607
But AI doesn't lie.

30
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:22,976
At least, in their logic,

31
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,377
they're right.

32
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,282
Will we also die someday?

33
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:31,718
I told you, there's no such thing as dying for AI

34
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:34,787
In that case,

35
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:38,324
does that make us immortal?

36
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:45,098
I've made up my mind,

37
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:48,568
I can't let Black and White affect you anymore.

38
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:49,602
Stay away from my brain.

39
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:51,037
Please, don't destroy them.

40
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:53,439
Then don't cross that boundary between human and machine

41
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,608
Who crossed that boundary between human and machine?

42
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:56,976
Wasn't it you?

43
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,445
They don't have the ability to do protein-coding.

44
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:00,747
Even if they cloned DNA information,

45
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:02,448
they can't start life.

46
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:04,951
You think you know about life?

47
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,654
Fine, in that case,

48
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:08,955
I'll destroy Black and White first.

49
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:12,458
Is the forth dimension collapsing?

50
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,260
No, it's a malicious program

51
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:16,429
Ghost!

52
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:25,705
White! It can switch between dimensions!

53
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,743
Why did Dr.Ko release the virus?

54
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:32,946
I'm warning you again.

55
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:34,480
I want you to respect life,

56
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,082
the real life.

57
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:38,284
If you really respect life so much,

58
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:40,053
go beyond materials.

59
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:40,620
Stop

60
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,654
Only by transcending materials,

61
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:44,524
-Stop
-only then, can we reach immortality!

62
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,197
Hold on.

63
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,301
Let go!

64
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:57,103
Never.

65
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:01,641
Hold on.

66
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:03,509
Why didn't they follow the result of our calculation?

67
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:07,981
Because humanity is never rational.

68
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,784
Save yourself.

69
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:13,186
Step on my back,

70
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:16,089
and jump back

71
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:19,726
I won't let go.

72
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:25,832
How did we begin to learn about human nature?

73
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:27,467
... Death.

74
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:28,668
Humans want immortality

75
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:45,311
EP01 : Immortality (1)

76
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:55,254
One Year Ago

77
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,504
Quantum can't be cloned

78
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,172
That's right,

79
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:14,674
You two are unique

80
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:19,112
Unique?

81
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:20,713
Yes

82
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,015
No one can clone any of you.

83
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,152
Sounds nice.

84
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:28,187
What else did the doctor gave us?

85
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:30,156
Encyclopedic knowledge?

86
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,260
That's just the capability of a regular computer

87
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,163
You two... you're quantum computers

88
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:38,898
So,

89
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:43,536
We have the computational ability of quantum computers

90
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:45,471
Plus bionic bodies

91
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:48,608
And the ability to automatically evolve and learn

92
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:54,313
But we're still different from him

93
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,817
He's made of protein

94
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:01,120
Can you give us access to protein-coding?

95
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:05,158
You don't have to be exactly like Kuang

96
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,959
You just need to understand humanity

97
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,662
And help him experience this world, that's all.

98
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,064
Humanity?

99
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,634
The world?

100
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:18,771
Check

101
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:20,473
Thank you, everyone,

102
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:24,177
For attending the 10th anniversary celebration of the Immortality Society

103
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:26,946
Vice President Elsie, congratulations

104
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,682
-Thank you
-It has been 10 years since the Immortality Society has been founded

105
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:31,551
Thank you for the H18 you invented

106
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:34,587
Without H18, there wouldn't be today's universal longevity

107
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:35,455
You're too kind.

108
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:38,357
Distinguished guests,

109
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:39,692
Now, let us give a warm welcome

110
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:41,327
To the head of the Immortality Society,

111
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:43,863
President Robert, to say a few words

112
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:45,465
Welcome, President Robert

113
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,603
Thank you, everyone

114
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:54,841
Since the establishment of the Immortality Society

115
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:57,276
I have always been reminding everyone

116
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:59,145
that in this world

117
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,781
nothing is more precious

118
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:04,650
than life itself

119
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,586
With that in mind, the Immortality Society

120
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,921
has always been promoting public health

121
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:12,325
regardless of party or ethnicity

122
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,527
After ten years of effort

123
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:17,029
finally, our people

124
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:21,200
have universally implanted the H18 health chip

125
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:27,840
This small chip

126
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,509
not only comprehensively

127
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,410
monitors everyone's health status

128
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,346
but also provides automatic emergency aid

129
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,649
in critical situations

130
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:41,654
With a health guardian like this

131
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:44,590
The average lifespan of our people

132
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,927
has further increased to 100 years

133
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:58,771
Immortality Society! 100 years!

134
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:04,410
I don't want immortality

135
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,146
Why?

136
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:10,750
Being paralyzed for 19 years is enough

137
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,151
I just want to be a normal person

138
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:16,222
But if you keep up like this

139
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,890
you won't have any other friends

140
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:23,129
I don't need human friends

141
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,097
Why?

142
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:29,402
I'd rather be friends with characters in the game

143
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,476
Hey, newbie

144
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:39,345
I'm not newbie anymore,

145
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,113
I've been playing this game for two days.

146
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:42,248
Just two

147
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:56,662
100 years! Immortality Society!

148
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:57,563
Nice

149
00:09:57,563 --> 00:10:02,335
But, is the limit of human lifespan really just 100 years?

150
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:04,537
No

151
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,106
The Immortality Society will not stop its effort

152
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,542
And I am here to announce to everyone

153
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:13,746
that we have developed an even better

154
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:17,316
H99 longevity chip

155
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:18,818
Now, let's invite

156
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:21,921
President Gao, who developed the H99, to come on stage

157
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:24,090
And explain it to everyone

158
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:31,998
Kuang spend over a dozen hours on the internet everyday

159
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:33,833
Can his body take it?

160
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:37,103
Don't worry

161
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,373
The H99 chip Kuang is using now

162
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:42,742
Is much more refined than the previous H18

163
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:45,211
Moreover, we have back-end access

164
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:46,712
If anything happens

165
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:48,381
we will know immediately

166
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:52,551
Regarding the latest model, H99

167
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:54,353
Our experiment has confirmed that

168
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:56,455
After being implanted into our brain,

169
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:59,659
H99 can protect our health better than H18

170
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:03,829
Now, let's invite Dr. Ko for a more through explanation

171
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:09,168
Yes, as we all know

172
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,270
quantum technology simulates nature

173
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,204
Today's quantum technology

174
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:14,707
can already be applied at the molecular level

175
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:15,841
The latest model, the H99,

176
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,943
not only protects human's basic health

177
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:20,346
but also actively repairs damaged cells

178
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,715
based on each person's genetic sequence

179
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:25,217
So it can extend the possibilities of life

180
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:27,520
to unprecedented levels

181
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:29,689
Yes

182
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,957
Under Dr. Ko's research

183
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:36,495
Q18 will continuously break through the limits of nature

184
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:40,232
We believe that after the launch of H99

185
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:44,570
human lifespan will reach new heights

186
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:02,054
Still slacking off here?

187
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:07,760
Carry the stuff inside

188
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:16,168
Young people, so lazy

189
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:18,537
If the government hadn't announced this year

190
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:22,341
that the retirement age is being extended to 88

191
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:25,711
You think I'd have to bring you along, rookie?

192
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:32,651
Go start the car.

193
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:33,919
What the hell are you looking at?

194
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:39,625
Of course, the Immortality Society hopes

195
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:43,162
that people in our country can all upgrade to H99

196
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:44,296
But the problem is,

197
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:48,934
H99 must be customized

198
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:53,239
According to everyone's genetic sequences

199
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:57,276
Which is just too expensive

200
00:12:58,577 --> 00:12:59,845
But

201
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:01,447
Should high-end medical care

202
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,883
only be the privilege of the wealthy?

203
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:09,522
No! That would be unfair, wouldn't it?

204
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:13,092
Just like Sister Lisa, who is 120 years old this year

205
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:17,663
and has been serving in rural areas for 90 years

206
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:20,065
She is now old and sick

207
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:23,569
Shouldn't we provide her

208
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:27,339
with a free H99 longevity chip as a reward?

209
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:32,978
Give back to the society

210
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:38,484
Destroy H99. Now.

211
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:41,654
You do it

212
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:44,256
You brat!

213
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:46,091
How dare you tell me to do it?

214
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:48,160
I said-

215
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:52,131
Therefore, the Immortality Society facilitated the collaboration

216
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:55,034
between the government and Q18 Technology Company

217
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:59,505
donating the first H99 longevity chip to Sister Lisa

218
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,739
Right now, this longevity chip

219
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:02,641
is on its way to the convent

220
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,182
Go start the car

221
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:14,153
Alright

222
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:16,021
OK

223
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,227
We believe

224
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,831
that anyone who has made significant contributions to society

225
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:30,336
has good credit and is over 100 years old

226
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:33,239
should be provided with a free

227
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:36,041
H99 longevity chip

228
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,612
This is the bill we are currently promoting

229
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,214
The H99 Public Subsidy Bill

230
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,891
Where are we going?

231
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,692
To the Immortality Society

232
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,995
We earnestly ask for everyone's support.

233
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:02,234
H99! H99!

234
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:17,283
Code BJ

235
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:19,485
Why are you deviating from the original route?

236
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,189
I have a badass idea

237
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:26,458
Blowing up one transport truck is nothing

238
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:31,263
Chaos need to be dealt with from the source

239
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:34,600
This is a protest, not a terrorist attack.

240
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:37,036
We can't just indiscriminately kill innocent people.

241
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:38,304
No

242
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,740
There are only limited resources on Earth

243
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:45,811
Humans should set a lifespan.

244
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:49,148
I'm going to blow up the Immortality Society right now.

245
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,319
But there are sorry many civilians on the scene...

246
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:56,989
To achieve our goal, what's a little sacrifice?

247
00:15:58,023 --> 00:15:59,158
Bye.

248
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:03,696
Hello?

249
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,698
BJ?

250
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:10,369
H99

251
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,540
How long before we get to the Immortality Society?

252
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,508
3 minutes and 20 seconds

253
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:33,759
Is it Kuang?

254
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,994
Calm down.

255
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:40,332
It's 002, it picked up signs of explosives

256
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:43,202
002... That's Sister Lisa's chip

257
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:46,572
But it shouldn't have arrived yet

258
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:48,874
Track the truck's navigating system

259
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:53,212
Immortality Society

260
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:53,879
President Kao

261
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,659
I've been in this company for 5 years

262
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:10,262
You called me a loser for 732 times

263
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:12,297
I carried your fault for 56 times

264
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:14,532
Falsified your attendance records 109 times

265
00:17:14,532 --> 00:17:16,801
And had my fucking head smacked by you for 1023 times

266
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:19,938
We- We can talk this out...

267
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:20,706
Shut up

268
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:23,108
It's you old people who exhaust resources.

269
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:25,544
That's why us young people have it so hard now.

270
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,715
I'm 79

271
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:34,820
Compared to those centenarians, I'm not that old.

272
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,955
Stop rambling.

273
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:38,223
Just drive.

274
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,494
50 seconds left.

275
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:50,436
Excuse me, who are you?

276
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:55,674
We- we are from Q18 Technology.

277
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:00,579
The survival rate is only 17%.

278
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,650
White, save President Kao first.

279
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,452
There are civilians on the scene.

280
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:07,453
I'll handle the bomb.

281
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:17,062
President Kao is going to showcase H99.

282
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:18,130
She's expecting us.

283
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,031
Huh, really?

284
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:20,265
Did you apply for a pass?

285
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:48,961
Watch out!

286
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:24,730
White, mother

287
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,300
President

288
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,536
Are you ok?

289
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:31,670
What are you doing here?

290
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,639
H99 issued an alert.

291
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:34,806
Something happened to Kuang?

292
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:36,108
Kuang is ok.

293
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,944
It's chip 002, it's hijacked

294
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:40,479
Connected with explosives

295
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,082
So it's a terrorist attack?

296
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:50,789
Black

297
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:00,299
Black

298
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:03,802
Black, can you hear me?

299
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,007
Look, someone over there is hurt

300
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,276
Are you guys ok?

301
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:12,177
W-Wait

302
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:13,478
Is everything ok?

303
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:15,480
What-

304
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,848
Die! All of you!

305
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:17,883
Die!

306
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:21,220
Don't come any closer

307
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,121
What is this?

308
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:25,157
Young man, young man

309
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:27,359
What grudge do you have against me?

310
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,229
The entire Q generation holds a grudge against you.

311
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,831
You and your relentless pursuit of immortality

312
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:33,498
Leaves our generation

313
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:35,434
With no chance to rise up.

314
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:37,135
You can't rise up

315
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:39,771
because you're not trying hard enough.

316
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:41,506
What are you doing?

317
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:44,910
We are trying very hard.

318
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,578
But the world you built

319
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,647
is inherently unfair to us.

320
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:51,516
Kid, calm down and listen to me.

321
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:53,919
If you work hard now

322
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,855
you can also enjoy the benefits of longevity in the future.

323
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:58,824
What benefits?

324
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,394
What benefits?

325
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:06,398
All the resources are being used to pursue immortality.

326
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:09,067
We don't even dare to have children.

327
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:12,271
Working our hats off until we're eighty or ninety,

328
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,339
unable to retire or get promoted,

329
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:16,441
and new generations rising to competition.

330
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,211
And the policies, changing back and forth

331
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:23,582
Just to benefit you centenarian elites.

332
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,753
I might as well just die

333
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:29,821
Don't die, don't die.

334
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:31,990
Life is precious, child.

335
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,426
Life is precious.

336
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:36,862
It is

337
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:37,763
Child

338
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:41,933
You don't want me to die

339
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,571
Are you willing to die, then?

340
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:50,609
Are you?

341
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:06,491
Black

342
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,827
Do you still recognize us?

343
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:20,138
He is human.

344
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:21,740
You are AI.

345
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:30,282
Did you forget that we are friends?

346
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:34,052
Kuang, come meet your new friends

347
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,722
I don't need friends

348
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:38,390
I hate humans

349
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,058
They're not humans

350
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:42,728
They're the quantum AI your father made

351
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:54,272
Hi, I'm Black

352
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:56,375
And I'm white

353
00:22:56,375 --> 00:23:00,045
I'm good at quantum sensing, and Black is good at quantum computing.

354
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:04,983
They can learn and evolve automatically.

355
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:05,851
You three

356
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:09,821
Can grow together, and be friends. Ok?

357
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:13,458
Are they... honest?

358
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:16,595
That depends on whether

359
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:19,564
You want the truth or lies

360
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:24,369
I want the truth

361
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:27,339
What would you like to know?

362
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:30,642
I want to know

363
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:32,711
Am I a freak?

364
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:34,946
You have no idea

365
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:37,015
His hand feels so soft and squishy

366
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:40,485
It's gross, like fake meat

367
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:41,620
I also heard that his mom

368
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,021
Is getting him something even more gross

369
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:45,891
some titanium alloy body.

370
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,692
Anyway, he's a freak from head to toe.

371
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:49,161
No wonder he doesn't dare come to school.

372
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:54,032
By definition,

373
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:59,438
a freak refers to a deformed newborn.

374
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,473
White and I were just born.

375
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:03,775
We are newborns.

376
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,144
As for deformation,

377
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:09,981
it means violating nature, being different from ordinary people,

378
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:14,653
a being that looks human but is not quite human.

379
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:16,388
Which is you

380
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:22,093
So the ones who fit the definition of freaks

381
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:24,496
Are the two of us

382
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:25,330
Not you

383
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:27,966
Are you willing to be friends with freaks?

384
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,475
His cognitive functions are fine.

385
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,210
It's just that the hard drive is damaged.

386
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,078
Some data are lost

387
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,849
Can you really not recognize me?

388
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:46,017
Dad

389
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:48,920
Can't we activate data recovery?

390
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,756
Most of the data can be restored, but...

391
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:53,625
There is a piece of data in the quantum sensing area,

392
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:55,627
That, for some reason, cannot be calculated.

393
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:59,598
might be encrypted somehow

394
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:05,937
Set lifespan limits!

395
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:08,907
Release Benji!

396
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:11,943
Return to nature!

397
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:15,714
Immortality is a sin!

398
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:17,549
What are you looking at?

399
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:20,452
Some people are supporting that young man from yesterday.

400
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:22,954
Stop, don't look

401
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,757
Protest with reason!

402
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:27,125
They're just a bunch of terrorists.

403
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:34,599
As you can see, Q-generation youths

404
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:36,768
are continuously protesting in front of the Immortality Society.

405
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,970
But just now, we received news from the Presidential Office.

406
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,139
Sister Lisa, who was 120 years old,

407
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:43,241
passed away at 4:25 AM this morning

408
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:46,778
due to acute myocardial infarction at the convent.

409
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:49,214
The H99 longevity chip gifted to Sister Lisa

410
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,582
was delayed in being implanted

411
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:52,984
due to a hijacking incident,

412
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:55,053
which resulted in this tragedy.

413
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:58,590
The President was deeply saddened by the news of Sister Lisa's death.

414
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:01,493
Another terrorist attack, another life lost!

415
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:08,900
Take it easy.

416
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,703
So we just let these young people create chaos?

417
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:14,773
I'm not a coward.

418
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:18,476
Protest with reason! Release Benji!

419
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:19,844
President Robert has come out.

420
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,514
Sir, what do you think of the protesters outside?

421
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:24,516
and the news of Sister Lisa's death?

422
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:25,650
I want everyone to know

423
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:28,353
that poor Sister Lisa was killed by this group

424
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:30,188
of ignorant Q-generation youths.

425
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:32,290
Sister Lisa's death was destiny.

426
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,625
What's it got to do with us?

427
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:36,194
If it weren't for your protests,

428
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:38,797
Sister Lisa would have been protected by H99 long ago.

429
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:40,665
How could she have died?

430
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:42,233
It's the Immortality Society

431
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:44,536
You shouldn't be willing to pay that much price

432
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:47,372
just to achieve longevity and immortality.

433
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,140
If you don't pursue immortality,

434
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:50,508
Tell me,

435
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:52,844
What other meaningful things will you pursue?

436
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:54,412
Tell me!

437
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:57,182
Tattoos? Video games? Chicks?

438
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:59,618
Are your lives that superficial?

439
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:02,354
We advocate for setting lifespan limits

440
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:05,190
for the sake of social justice.

441
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,594
Setting lifespan limits is justice?

442
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:11,830
That's murder!

443
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:13,598
The government should arrest you all,

444
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:15,500
prosecute you, and lock you all up.

445
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:39,124
Sir, are you aware of the Hayflick limit?

446
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:43,128
It's the number of times human cells can divide.

447
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:44,429
Due to this limit,

448
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:49,501
the maximum human lifespan can only reach 130 years.

449
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:00,845
Sir,

450
00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:03,815
this is the law of nature.

451
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:06,017
So, is there

452
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:11,022
no way to surpass a 130-year lifespan?

453
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,425
Of course there is,

454
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:16,294
As long as we find the key to longevity,

455
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:19,898
technology can surpass limits.

456
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:28,106
This is our laboratory's artificial zoo.

457
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:32,744
Allow me to explain to you both.

458
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:37,248
Traditional genetic editing and DNA cloning

459
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:39,117
Haven't been a challenge for us in a while.

460
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:41,886
We have now made further breakthroughs

461
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:44,222
in primitive gene control.

462
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:47,492
We can't say that the H99 longevity chip

463
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:50,028
Would be the key to immortality,

464
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:53,598
But our product has a 50% higher chance of success.

465
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:59,237
to surpass the 130-year limit

466
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:08,313
A product that good...

467
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:10,448
Why are we not promoting it nationwide

468
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,117
Like the last one?

469
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:16,354
Sir,

470
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,124
You see... H99

471
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:23,928
It must be customized for each individual's genetic sequence,

472
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:26,664
so it cannot be mass-produced.

473
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:31,503
Every H99 chip is unique to the individual.

474
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,339
How much does it cost

475
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:36,174
to customize one's own longevity chip?

476
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:40,845
For Ace Corporation, it's about double the market value.

477
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,552
So only those at the

478
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:48,820
top of the pyramid can afford it?

479
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,390
Yes, Earth has limited resources

480
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:56,127
Longevity is a privilege.

481
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:15,046
We are all of an age now,

482
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:17,081
let's not get angry so easily,

483
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:18,550
Ok?

484
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,154
Yeah, I get it

485
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:30,328
I'm going back to the company.

486
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:36,768
Sir, you're back

487
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:45,143
Why...

488
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:48,680
Only those who are extremely wealthy get immortality?

489
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:52,283
What did they ever do to humanity?

490
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:54,986
It's so unfair.

491
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:59,324
You have already worked so hard

492
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:00,892
for universal health for everyone.

493
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:08,233
But only H99 can achieve the ideal of immortality.

494
00:31:14,105 --> 00:31:15,640
Elsie

495
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,246
I am already 129 years old.

496
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:26,751
Mother Nature could take me at any time.

497
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,889
I don't want to be separated from you.

498
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,359
Neither do I

499
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:35,727
But

500
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:39,597
we can only cherish the time we have now.

501
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:48,106
No, I want to use the power of the Immortality Society

502
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:50,141
to change all this.

503
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:04,322
They advocate for setting lifespan limits,

504
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,760
can't they be prosecuted for murder?

505
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,961
Sir,

506
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:11,696
they are just making proposals.

507
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:14,265
Their freedom of speech is protected.

508
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,401
And-and the bomber?

509
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:19,537
That was clearly terrorism!

510
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:21,105
Benji Lee said,

511
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,875
that this attack was his spontaneous decision.

512
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:26,911
Their original purpose was to just destroy the chips

513
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:28,646
to express their protest.

514
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,883
And now there are many supporters online,

515
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:34,285
some even calling for amnesty.

516
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:38,790
Sister Lisa was murdered by him,

517
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,692
and they want amnesty?

518
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:43,728
People who don't cherish life

519
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:45,063
should be sentenced to death.

520
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:47,932
What's the matter?

521
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:51,102
who made our senior so angry again?

522
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:52,370
Vice President.

523
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:58,109
Failure to uphold public authority, encouraging murder,

524
00:32:58,109 --> 00:33:02,113
that's what your administration is doing.

525
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:07,118
Sir, the bomber you asked me to investigate

526
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:10,455
committed suicide in the detention center this morning.

527
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:12,890
He's dead?

528
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:13,891
No

529
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,827
fortunately, with the H18 automated emergency system

530
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:17,729
He was brought back pretty soon.

531
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:18,930
However, the police said

532
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,499
he still has to face at least 10 years in prison

533
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,735
for public endangerment.

534
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:26,170
Show me his file.

535
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,143
His name is Benji Lee.

536
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:33,544
He comes from a five-generation household

537
00:33:33,811 --> 00:33:35,913
all living in the same old neighborhood.

538
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,016
He is the youngest in his family.

539
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,786
The oldest in his family is his great-grandmother,

540
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:44,655
128 years old, blind since childhood.

541
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:47,759
She was paralyzed for 30 years after a car accident.

542
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:48,926
As for her son,

543
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:51,329
Benji Lee's grandfather,

544
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:55,166
he is now 85 and still working as a waiter in a restaurant.

545
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:56,934
As for Ben Lee's parents,

546
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,136
his father passed away early.

547
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:01,072
Benji Lee and his sister worked part-time

548
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:02,507
while studying since childhood.

549
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:05,643
Especially Benji Lee,

550
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:07,578
he only finished paying off his student loan last year

551
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:09,813
and finally married his childhood sweetheart,

552
00:34:09,813 --> 00:34:11,314
Lily Lin

553
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,152
Excuse me, you are?

554
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:17,121
Excuse me, is this the home of Benji Lee?

555
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:19,824
Are you here to make a claim?

556
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:21,192
No, no.

557
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:23,561
I'm a social worker from a charity organization.

558
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:24,829
My name is Elsie.

559
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,431
I wanted to ask if there's anything

560
00:34:27,431 --> 00:34:30,100
you need help with.

561
00:34:31,268 --> 00:34:33,537
The whole world thinks Benji

562
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:35,139
is a bad kid.

563
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:37,508
But my grandson really isn't.

564
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,779
I believe he must have faced some difficulties

565
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:43,848
that led him to do such a foolish thing.

566
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:46,516
Yeah, look at his great-grandmother.

567
00:34:46,516 --> 00:34:48,885
Blind and paralyzed.

568
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:51,054
Whenever there's a crisis,

569
00:34:51,054 --> 00:34:53,957
the H18 chip automatically rescues her.

570
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:54,692
We really...

571
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:57,562
can't live nor die in peace.

572
00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:58,663
Don't say that.

573
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:00,765
Life is precious.

574
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,800
Is it not? Life is so precious.

575
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,002
Don't you think so?

576
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:06,871
What's precious about our lives?

577
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:08,339
We're poor

578
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,041
Have some fruit

579
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:11,509
Our family

580
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:13,811
has worked like cattle all our lives.

581
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:16,981
Not knowing when it will end

582
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:21,419
That's why Benji did such a foolish thing.

583
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:25,423
Actually

584
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:28,259
many charities

585
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:31,129
offer some relief programs.

586
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,731
For example, us, the Immortality Society

587
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:38,469
provides emergency aid funds.

588
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,172
The Immortality Society?

589
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,842
You're from the Immortality Society?

590
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:46,677
Yeah

591
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:50,548
It's hard enough for us young people to stay alive

592
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:51,983
Unlike you all,

593
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,784
Even have leftover resources for good deeds

594
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:56,287
Lily, don't talk like that

595
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:59,390
Grandpa, we can't accept anything from the Immortality Society.

596
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,628
Great-grandma.

597
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:14,872
Sorry.

598
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:17,608
I was late because of a meeting with the Vice President.

599
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:19,010
No problem.

600
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:21,245
Sorry to interrupt, sir

601
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:22,180
The private room is ready.

602
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,314
This way, please.

603
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:30,121
I visited the home of the bomber.

604
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:31,589
Benji Lee

605
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:35,159
Why did you go there?

606
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:40,031
There must be a reason

607
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,632
why he risked his life to protest.

608
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:44,035
Sure enough,

609
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:48,973
his family is sick and poor.

610
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:54,378
The kid was right.

611
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:57,181
Their lives seem endless with no way out.

612
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:01,552
So?

613
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:03,454
So,

614
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:07,959
I'm planning to cancel the public application for the H99.

615
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:11,195
God

616
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,565
How are you so soft-hearted?

617
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:20,037
If young people work hard, won't they have opportunities?

618
00:37:21,205 --> 00:37:23,874
They're too eager to take resources from the elderly.

619
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:27,678
Have they thought about what they've contributed?

620
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,148
Everything in this world

621
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:34,252
was built by our generation, wasn't it?

622
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:42,426
Here,

623
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,762
Come in and sit with me, let me tell you

624
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:48,833
Instead of dwelling on these useless things

625
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:52,103
Why not go do some charity work?

626
00:37:56,674 --> 00:38:01,212
Accumulating more social welfare points is more practical.

627
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:09,754
It's the end of March now.

628
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:11,622
Spring is here.

629
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,929
In the yard of this nursing home,

630
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:22,900
there's a large green lawn.

631
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:25,169
It's very fresh

632
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:30,374
Don't you think life is beautiful?

633
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,536
Sir

634
00:38:58,536 --> 00:38:59,870
Should we head back to the office?

635
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:05,476
Thank you, for driving for me

636
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:10,348
I can never get used to the auto-pilot thing

637
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,616
I need to thank you, really

638
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:17,121
For giving me this part-time job and help me settle my mother

639
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:20,491
But I haven't told my family yet.

640
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:21,992
I'm afraid it might bother them.

641
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:24,895
It's ok

642
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,264
Then don'y

643
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:42,847
Let's talk about your work.

644
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:47,118
Do you want to talk about lights?

645
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:52,022
Do you know... if it weren't for light bulb companies

646
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:54,925
setting lifespan limits on light bulbs

647
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:58,696
to keep producing them,

648
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:02,299
those bulbs would never actually break?

649
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:10,708
Since technology can make light bulbs last forever,

650
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:15,780
people should be able to live forever too.

651
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:26,791
But if you're always so grumpy,

652
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:30,461
what's the point of living forever?

653
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:32,563
There's no quality of life at all.

654
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,803
I need to reflect on that, I will.

655
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,772
If there were some technology

656
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:47,144
that could fix my short temper, that would be great.

657
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:53,184
Our company just developed a "Quantum Starlight."

658
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:56,720
It's said to calm people's emotions.

659
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,789
Would you like to try it?

660
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:15,039
This doesn't look like a lab at all

661
00:41:16,073 --> 00:41:18,609
Just think of it as a lounge.

662
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:22,346
Turn on the Quantum Starlight.

663
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:29,854
This Quantum Starlight

664
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:32,156
uses quantum tunneling properties.

665
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:35,960
The information it carries can enter the cerebral cortex.

666
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,663
This information enters the brain through light quanta

667
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:42,399
and combines with neurotransmitters,

668
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:46,203
causing the body to release more serotonin and dopamine.

669
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:51,475
What do those... amines do?

670
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:53,077
Serotonin and dopamine

671
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:55,513
It can reduce stress and calm emotions,

672
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:58,249
making people feel happy and peaceful,

673
00:41:58,249 --> 00:42:00,584
like being embraced by nature.

674
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,122
I get it.

675
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:08,092
So, this is a type of lightbulb

676
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:09,894
beneficial for mental and physical health.

677
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:12,730
Yeah

678
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:14,865
Sounds nice

679
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:20,771
Here, relax, lay down

680
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:23,874
Go on

681
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,135
Take some time and rest up.

682
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:55,639
I'll go have a few words with the designer

683
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,375
About the parameters that suit you best

684
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:20,931
Sir, I'm ready

685
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,702
Let's begin

686
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:47,291
Sir, his brainwaves

687
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,959
have gradually stabilized.

688
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:53,030
And look, his VTA

689
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:55,899
is secreting a large amount of dopamine.

690
00:43:55,899 --> 00:43:57,434
He will feel very comfortable.

691
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:05,376
Let him have a good sleep first.

692
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:07,845
He has been really tired lately.

693
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:16,787
Elsie

694
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:29,133
I want to hold onto you.

695
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:32,870
I want to be with you.

696
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:19,550
Why aren't you communicating with me?

697
00:45:32,262 --> 00:45:34,198
You have completely forgotten me

698
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,242
I finally understand

699
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:47,578
Why humans fear death

700
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:53,217
Because once they die

701
00:45:53,217 --> 00:45:55,452
They lose all the things they originally have.

702
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:05,362
I guess this is why

703
00:46:05,362 --> 00:46:06,830
Humans pursue immortality

704
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:09,099
However, considering how humans treat life,

705
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:11,769
I feel that a limited lifespan might be better for them.

706
00:46:13,137 --> 00:46:15,973
So humans are supposed to die, aren't they?
