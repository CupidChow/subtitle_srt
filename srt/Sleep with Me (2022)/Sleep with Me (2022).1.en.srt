Luna.

Ah…

00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:28,221
How are you?

8
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:29,856
How am I?

9
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:33,093
Weren't you the one who broke up with me
via text and disappeared?

10
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:34,994
Ah…

11
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:38,131
-Sorry?
-Wow. Thanks.

12
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,168
You know it was for the best, right?

13
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:44,170
I mean, we're not a good match.

14
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:46,840
It's just, we're so different
from each other.

15
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:51,344
Well, anyway, thank you so much
for putting my stuff together,

16
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:53,947
and it was nice seeing you.

17

Luna.

18

I can change.

19
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:00,687
I'll change my sleeping habits
to match yours.

20
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:02,956
No, no. I don't want that.

21
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,958
I can do it.

22
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:08,261
My coach said that pain is temporary
but quitting lasts forever.

23
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:11,631
Well, ah…

24
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:15,001

Hi.

30
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,406
You need help?

31
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:55,909
I can manage.

32
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:57,343
-Don't worry.
-Sure?

33
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,444
Yes.

Okay, good.

It's not like I was going to help.

Wow.

37
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,684

-Can you help me out?
-[keys jangling]

55
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,650
Is that yours?

No, I'm stealing it.

57
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:47,020
That slot is for PWDs.

58
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:48,521
Can't you see the signpost?

59
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,190

-Anyway, ma'am.

It's 12:01.

70
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,916
Are you still awake?

71
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:54,120
You're with Harry who isn't hairy.

The Harry who's in no hurry.

And, the Harry who will
help you fall asleep.

[Harry on radio] Angel, I understand.

77
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:24,584
You're in a difficult situation.

78
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:28,187
It's not easy to forget a person
you've known for a long time,

79
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:29,222
but,

80
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,924
choose yourself.

81
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:37,897
Don't force yourself on someone
who isn't right for you.

00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,999
Angel, we're rooting for you.

that every broken heart

89

Why?

102
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,591
It's just that the whole time
I've known you,

103
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,626
you rarely come alone.

104
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,127

talking about her ex?

00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:51,430
Do you think I'm a difficult person
to have a relationship with?

118
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:53,232
Not my area of expertise.

You think that you need to protect
other people from your condition,

124
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:18,391
or do you think you need
to protect yourself?

125
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:21,394
You're afraid of your own feelings,

126
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:26,299
so you stick with people and things
that don't make you feel anything.

The part where you're
emotionally unavailable?

147
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:24,023
Or the part where you can only
fall asleep in the daytime?

187
00:12:58,244 --> 00:12:59,545
[Harry] Here we go.

188
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,647
Caller number seven, you're on the air.

189
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:02,848
What's your name?

190
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:04,283
Wendy.

191
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,785
[Harry] Hi, Wendy.

192
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:06,852
So, Wendy,

193
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:10,122
do you have our winning pick-up line?

194
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:11,690
[Wendy] Yes, of course.

195
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:13,292
[Harry] Okay. Wait.

196
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:16,395
If you win our giveaway,

197
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:20,166
do you know who you're taking to dinner?

198
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:23,502
My ex who dumped me.

199
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:24,870
[Harry] Huh? [chuckles]

200
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:27,540
Wendy, why them?

201
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:30,075
You said they left you.

202
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:30,976
So, why?

203
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:32,545
[Wendy] It's none of your business.

204
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:34,680
-Let's just get on with it.
-[Harry chuckles]

205
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,081
Okay,

206
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,951
Wendy, what's your pick-up line?

207
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:42,621
Are you a tower?

208
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:44,123
Why?

209
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,892
Because…

210
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,861
"Eiffel" for you. [Wendy laughs]

211
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:50,496
Okay.

212
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:54,466
Okay, guys. Did you hear
Wendy's pick-up line?

213
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:55,434
Is it good enough?

214
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,436
Is she deserving of the giveaway?

215
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,038
[applause, cheering]

216
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:00,573
And there you have it, Wendy.

217
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,308
Our listeners liked your pick-up line.

218
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:03,909
Congratulations!

219
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:06,846
You are the winner of a dinner for two.

220
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:08,480
-Oh my God!
-[Harry] You can pick up your prize,

221
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:09,849
Mondays to Fridays, at--

222
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:12,484
Oh my God! [laughs]

223
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:35,541
[quirky music playing]

224
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,298
[Wendy clears throat]

225
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,671
Hello.

226
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,278
I'm Wendy.

227
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:16,482
Luna, right?

228
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,451
Luna Jimenez?

229
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:21,253
Yeah.

230
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,589
I saw it on your credit card.

231
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,492
You remember that time

232
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:28,360
when you forgot to bring cash

233
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,863
so you asked us
if we accept credited cards?

234
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,998
[laughs] What were you thinking?

235
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,135
I paid for your food that night.

236
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:43,809
Anyway, since we've already met,

237
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:46,011
it's nothing big, I'm just

238
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:48,280
wondering if

239
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:50,916
you can do me a favor?

240
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:58,123
You heard what happened, right?

241
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:00,926
Yes, well…

242
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:03,462
I won the grand prize.

243
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:07,700
And I need it

244
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,903
so my ex and I can get back together.

245
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:15,941
But, the problem is…

246
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,978
I can't leave work.

247
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:22,281
Hey.

248
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:27,252
Maybe you could…

249
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:29,621
Only if it's okay.

250
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:33,625
Maybe you could claim the prize for me?

251
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,263
Please. Claim it for me.

252
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,832
The station is near. I promise.

253
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:41,200
It's really close.

254
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:44,570
Please.

255
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:45,938
Please.

256
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,172
Luna, please.

257
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:49,174
I know you can hear me.

258
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:50,576
Please. Please. Please.

259
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:52,778
I really need you to do this for me.

260
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:53,746
Fine.

261
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:56,348
I can't leave
because I don't want to get fired.

262
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:58,350
-Okay, fine.
-Okay?

263
00:16:58,417 --> 00:16:59,251
-You sure?
-Yeah.

264
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:00,953
I'm not forcing you.

265
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,821
Here's my ID. [laughs]

266
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:04,723
-Okay.
-Hey. Seriously?

267
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,958
Yeah, give it to me.

268
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:08,227
You know what? Luna.

269
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:09,661
You're my new best friend.

270
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:12,264
-No problem. I'll go ahead.
-Thank you.

271
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:13,866
You're not going to finish your food?

272
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:15,367
It's fine. No worries.

273
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:16,802
All right. Oh my God!

274
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,871
Really, thank you.

275
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:21,106
I'll wait for you here.
Just give me my ID later.

276
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:22,274
Okay.

277
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:25,411
Thank you. Thank you, thank you.

278
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:27,212
Bye-bye. Take care, okay?

279
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,347
It's already late.

280
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:30,182
-[door chiming]
-[Wendy] Bye!

281
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:36,588
[Harry] That's life. Sometimes we lose.

282
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:38,090
Am I right, Caller Nica?

283
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:42,027
[muffled] But instead of
seeing it as a loss,

284
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:44,430
you can look at it as a new beginning.

285
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:46,532
You're not alone.

286
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:51,637
Take a break until you're ready.

287
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:55,441
Ready to smile again. Ready to try again.

288
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:59,945
But for now, go get some sleep.

289
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:02,114
It's time to sleep, everybody.

290
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:05,651
And always remember, if you're lonely,

291
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:08,387
I'm here for you.

292
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:09,888
This has been Harry

293
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:13,425
and you've been listening to
Sleep with Me.

294
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:14,493
Good night.

295
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:20,599
[slow, romantic music playing]

296
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,081
[Luna] Fuck.

297
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,687
-Oh!
-Oh!

298
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:43,355
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

299
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:44,523
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

300
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,657
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

301
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:47,126
Sorry.

302
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:48,160
Sorry.

303
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:51,063
Is this yours?

304
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:53,365
No, but…

305
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:55,868
Sorry, did I hurt you?

306
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:57,269
No, I'm okay.

307
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,338
Is this you?

308
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:00,706
Wendy Vargas?

309
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:02,374
No.

310
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:03,675
My friend.

311
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:04,643
I mean,

312
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,846
a friend that's not really my friend.

313
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:09,281
You know, just

314
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:11,350
a casual acquaintance.

315
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:16,155
She was the one who won your contest

316
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:19,091
and she asked me to get the prize here.

317
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,459
Are you a tower?

318
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:24,530
Because "Eiffel" for you?

319
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:30,402
[chuckles] That was her winning
pick-up line. Wendy, right?

320
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:31,303
Oh!

321
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,505
-She was dumped by her ex.
-[Luna laughs]

322
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:34,640
Yes.

323
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:38,043
Yeah, Wendy. That's her.

324
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:41,847
Yeah.

325
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:44,783
She ended the call before I could explain.

326
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,085
The office is closed, so

327
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:49,488
you need to come back
during business hours.

328
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,056
Right.

329
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:52,124
Okay, um…

330
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,359
[Harry chuckles] You're so nice.

331
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:56,628
You're a good friend.

332
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:01,733
It's my first time hearing that.

333
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,135
That you're nice?

334
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,603
Or that you're a good friend?

335
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:06,838
Both.

336
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,375
I'm none of the above, I think.

337
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:16,248
Anyway.

338
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,784
I'll let her know.

339
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:19,685
Yeah.

340
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,088
Again, I'm sorry for what happened.

341
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:25,290
-I can help if you want.
-No, no.

342
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:27,626
It's okay. I'm not as fragile as I look.

343
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:29,628
Yeah. I didn't mean it that way.

344
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,430
Right.

345
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:33,232
Sorry.

346
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:39,204
[somber music playing]

347
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:45,777
[door creaks]

348
