Are you sure?

00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:55,972
We can stop if you want.

4
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,516
Yeah, I'm sure. Super sure.

5
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,269
-I'm sure.
-Okay.

[both giggling]

13
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:59,828
Why'd you wear these pants?
That's a lot of buttons.

14
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,371
It was cute.

15
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:08,378
Okay.

You're not allowed
to wear these pants ever again.

21
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:29,023
Kai chose them.

22
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,650
Well, burn them.

Are you awake?

00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,023
[Luna] Mm.

28
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,402
Wake up.

29
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,116
Wake up.

31
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,203
Why?

32
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:08,122
Tell me a secret.

33
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,295
Okay.

34
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:20,343
Hmm.

-Hmm?
-Hmm.

36
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:26,683
Fine.

37
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,186
I'll go first.

38
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,606
I hated Kai when he was born.

39
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,692
I wanted to return him.

41
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,166
Do you want to know?

Do you want to tell me?

43
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,391

00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,436
High school.

45
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:13,604
I'm sorry.

46
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,815
-No.
-[kisses]

47
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,400
Don't be. Please.

48
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,239
We're all going to end up here.

49
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,742
Eventually.

50
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,708
Were you the one driving?

51
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,418
No.

52
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:39,714
But I don't hold grudges.

[gentle music playing]

54
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,428
It took

55
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,557
a lot of learning.

56
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:54,729
The first four years just…

57
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,900
getting comfortable being
"that person in the wheelchair"

58
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:00,276

[gentle music continues]

61
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,085
If I told you I had a rare condition,

62
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,879
would you believe me?

63
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,592
Why wouldn't I?

64
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:27,637
Well,

65
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,139
most people don't.

66
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:32,683
Try me.

67
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,022
I'm a vampire.

68
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,774
Oh.

-Hey, what?
-[laughing]

73
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,033
Well, um…

74
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,744
Kinda? I don't know.

75
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,913
Ugh, fine.

76
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:57,416
Well, I have this thing called, um…

77
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:01,254
delayed sleep phase syndrome.

78
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,260
It's not insomnia because
I never have a hard time sleeping,

79
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:08,845
but,

80
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:16,185
basically, my body tells me
to sleep in the morning,

81
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,478
and

82
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:21,691
my body tells me to wake up at night.

83
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,027
You've had this for a while?

84
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,362
[Luna] Mm-hmm.

85
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,948
Yeah. All my life.

86
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,326
You know that feeling when

87
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:37,457
all your classmates have gone home
and you're still there?

88
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,755
That's how I felt all my life.

89
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,425
You know, 'cause

90
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,344
I was an outcast.

91
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:55,308
You know, I don't have friends
because they always say I'm a snob.

92
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:59,520
I'm always too serious, too quiet, and…

93
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,233
I don't know,
I guess I hated that so much.

94
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:08,529
I couldn't do anything.
It's not like I have a choice.

95
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,241
But I just couldn't tell anyone
my condition 'cause…

96
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,578
I know

97
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:18,664
that they'll probably just end up saying,

98
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:22,084
"Stop drinking coffee,"
or, "Go to sleep early."

99
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,465
But why did you feel like
this was something

100
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,425
that you had to hide?

101
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:32,762
I guess it just…

102
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,307
makes me feel different?

103
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,102
I mean, just…

104
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:44,857
also makes me a coward, I guess.

105
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,276
No.

106
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:53,950
I think that people hide
what makes them different

107
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,786
to make them feel safe.

108
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,958
Just makes me feel like
I'm hiding most of the time.

109
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,087
I can make you feel safe.

110
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,713
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

111
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,340
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

112
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:11,300
How?

113
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,680
I have a green belt in taekwondo.

114
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,014

-Uh-huh.

Wow. One more.

118
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,397
That's my stance.

119
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,439
Like this.

120
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,775

I'm studying… without headphones!

124
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,242
I told you he was annoying.

125
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:39,036
Yeah, you should have returned him.

I need you to accept my offer.

132

We have this new project
and you're perfect for it.

133

I swear it's going to be fun.

134
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,703
You have no excuses anymore.

135
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,496
I'll think about it.

136
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,664
Okay, okay. But…

137
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,000
you know this is where
you should be, right?

138
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,710
And I can't wait forever.

139
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,670
Yeah, I know.

140
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:33,049
Um, I'll talk to you later, okay?

141
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,425
Okay. Call me back.

142
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,469
Thanks, bye.

143
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,513
Should I get a restraining order?

Um…

147
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:47,772
I'll think about it.

148

Harry.

149
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,861
[Kai] Maybe we can reach out
to Mom and Dad?

150
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:56,572
I'm sure they're very willing to help us.

151
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,115
Kai.

152
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,743
I'm going to tell you what I told them.

153
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:04,163
[Harry] We're doing fine.
We can do this on our own.

Just someone from school.

Fine, it's Whammy.

Hey! I thought he was bad news.

161
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,312
He said sorry.

162
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,356
-Okay.
-Don't worry.

163
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:33,150
If he hurts you again,
he's answering to me.

164
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,777
[clicks tongue] Okay.

Don't go in there!

00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,079
Why'd they go in there?

170
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:49,250
He's so loud. Why was he invited?

171
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,668

172
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,169

00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:04,056
I hate scary movies.

178
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,892
It's not that scary, babe.

179
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,228
[Kai] Luna, it was so scary.

180
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,646
Right babe, agree with me.
