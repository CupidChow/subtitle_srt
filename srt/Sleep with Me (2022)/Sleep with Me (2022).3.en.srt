00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:43,176
[chill music playing]

2
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:12,038
-Harry! How have you been?
-Hey.

3
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:13,139
[laughs] I'm good.

4
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:15,175
Belle, right?

5
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:16,876
Luna. It's Luna.

6
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:17,811
-Luna?
-Yes.

7
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:20,780
Sorry, poor eyesight.

8
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:22,015
Does she eat meat?

9
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,783
Hey.

10
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,318
Oh, uh…

11
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:26,219
I do.

12
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:29,823
[woman] I had to ask.
The last one only ate veggies, right?

13
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,358
All right, let me get your order.

14
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:33,493
Thank you.

15
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:41,568
Who was she talking about?

16
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:44,938
Um, my ex.

17
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:49,542
-When did--
-So what are--

18
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,044
[both laugh]

19
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,645
-You go--
-I was just gonna ask…

20
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:54,514
You go first.

21
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:56,182
Uh…

22
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:57,684
[laughs] Sorry.

23
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,352
I forgot what I was gonna say.

24
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:00,653
[both laugh]

25
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,155
Sorry.

26
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:08,094
Sorry.

27
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,033
I know.

28
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,071
Let's pretend that we've
known each other for a long time.

29
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,839
-Game?
-Okay.

30
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:20,840
Okay.

31
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:32,585
Um…

32
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:36,990
so…

33
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:38,625
why did you guys break up?

34
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:42,996
What?

35
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:45,932
What?

36
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,800
What? [laughs]

37
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:49,269
-Well, you said…
-[Harry laughs]

38
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,570
You told me to pretend…

39
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:52,172
-No, no, no.
-Never mind.

40
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:54,040
Forget about it. Sorry I asked.

41
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:56,643
-I was just…
-It's okay, I started it.

42
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:58,077
Um…

43
00:02:58,144 --> 00:02:59,646
Okay. [laughs]

44
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,414
-[laughs] Sorry.
-Well.

45
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:03,416
How do I say this?

46
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,190
She was perfect on paper, but…

47
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:15,528
But something always felt a little off.

48
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:18,798
Yep.

49
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:21,868
Like…

50
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:22,902
like what?

51
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:25,205
[laughs] Um…

52
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,977
I could never figure out

53
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,380
if her feelings for me were real.

54
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:36,816
Ah.

55
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,790
-Sorry for asking.
-[Harry laughs]

56
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:45,091
It's okay.

57
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,594
Hey. Thank you.

58
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,163
Okay.

59
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:56,536
[Harry] Oh, sauce.

60
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:58,171
Thanks.

61
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:10,617
[laughs]

62
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:12,919
I learned something at work today.

63
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:17,890
If you want your soup to cool down faster,
just add some water to it.

64
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:21,094
It's faster that way.

65
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,697
You don't have to waste your energy
on blowing on your soup.

66
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,933
You can just do this.

67
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:32,572
Okay.

68
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:36,609
Did you know that putting
water in your soup

69
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:38,411
makes it lose its flavor?

70
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:39,879
Got it, okay.

71
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:40,813
[chuckles]

72
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,048
Science, it's just…

73
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,249
I'm a…

74
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,553
Science textbook writer, so…

75
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,788
[Harry laughs] Okay.

76
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:51,991
Miss Science Project, that's enough.

77
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:54,894
It's time to try the best
noodles of your life.

78
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:55,928
-Dig in.
-Okay.

79
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:57,664
-Sauce.
-Yeah.

80
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,465
-The best?
-Mm-hmm.

81
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:02,335
Okay.

82
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:06,072
[Luna] Mmm.

83
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,508
Okay.

84
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:10,777
It is good.

85
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:12,645
-Yes?
-Yes.

86
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:16,749
Oh my God, it's so yummy.

87
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:22,622
[slurping]

88
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,391
Hey.

89
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,426
Why don't you slow down?

90
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,461
It's still hot. I burnt myself already.

91
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:35,868
So good.

92
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:40,540
Sorry, you just have something on your…

93
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:44,344
Here.

94
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,279
Okay.

95
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:49,649
Sorry.

96
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:02,562
You know this doesn't count
as a date, right?

97
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,467
[Harry] Mmm. [laughs]

98
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:10,036
Well, who said this was a date?

99
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,304
It's not?

100
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,072
No, I mean…

101
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,041
I'm sorry.

102
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:16,376
[laughs]

103
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:19,312
Sorry, I didn't mean it that way.

104
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,015
Okay, I give up. Ah,

105
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:25,718
what counts as a date, then?

106
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:27,520
Dinner.

107
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,357
But…

108
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,527
You have to ask me.

109
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:36,129
Okay.

110
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,564
Okay.

111
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:39,665
Yeah.

112
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,235
Um…

113
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:45,071
Hey.

114
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:47,440
Harry?

115
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,008
Hey, Harry.

116
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,543
-Yes?
-Um…

117
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,713
Go on a date with me?

118
00:06:58,885 --> 00:06:59,786
Yes?

119
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:05,024
[chill music playing]

120
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,489
[phone ringing]

121
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:46,432
Nice of you to join us today.

122
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:49,502
I know you're a late riser.

123
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:51,771
You look tired.

124
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,340
I am tired.

125
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:57,577
But, ah, I'm happy to be here, so…

126
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:02,882
You know, I cut back my coffee intake
and it helped me sleep at night.

127
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:05,918
No caffeine after 1:00 p.m. for me.

128
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,520
Have you tried that?

129
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,796
You know, Luna.
You're really good at this.

130
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:20,500
Taking really complex ideas

131
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:23,369
and simplifying it into something

132
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:28,774
that a high school student can understand.

133
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,812
[laughs]

134
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:33,980
Thank you?

135
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:38,284
You know, we have a position opening up.

136
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:42,188
Better pay, more leaves. But…

137
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:47,393
You're going to have to start
exerting yourself more.

138
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,163
Exerting myself more?

139
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,766
It's an office position.

140
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:57,537
From 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.,
you have to be here.

141
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:03,943
From nine to five?

142
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:06,946
I'm sorry, but is there another option?

143
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,849
-I can even work longer hours.
-Luna.

144
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:13,319
I've been through that phase.

145
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,956
I've known you since I took a risk on you,

146
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:21,227
hiring you even without a college degree.

147
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:23,229
And that risk paid off.

148
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,599
But you're not getting any younger.

149
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,735
You can't just party every night.

150
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:33,239
I don't really go to parties.

151
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:34,974
Whatever you say.

152
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,709
You've always been good at your job.

153
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,110
So it's fine with me.

154
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:42,181
I'm just saying, you have potential.

155
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,351
You just need to exert yourself more.

156
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,253
You need to work harder.

157
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:51,123
Anyway, you don't need
to decide right away.

158
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,259
Just think about it.

159
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:58,264
[chill music playing]

160
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,174
[footsteps approaching]

161
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:13,346
[man] Harry.

162
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:15,081
Boss. Hey.

163
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:16,215
How are you?

164
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,316
I'm doing good. How about you?

165
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:19,652
Okay. Ah…

166
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,520
I have something to tell you.

167
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,323
It's been hard these days.

168
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:28,494
I'm sure you know
the station will be closing soon.

169
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:33,899
Boss, is there no chance to save it?

170
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:36,469
Unlikely.

171
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:40,106
We don't have advertisers anymore.

172
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:41,941
It's hard to keep up.

173
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:46,679
Boss…

174
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:48,414
This station is an icon.

175
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,915
It's an institution.

176
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,150
What will…

177
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:56,956
I'm gonna take care of my grandkids now.

178
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,326
It's you I'm worried about.

179
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,261
I'm okay, boss.

180
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:04,163
Don't worry.

181
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:16,976
[bittersweet song playing over radio]

182
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:28,554
[Harry] It's hard to say
goodbye to friends

183
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:31,557
you've known for a long time.

184
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:37,396
You always thank me for being here
on the nights that you can't sleep,

185
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:41,033
or when you're bored, or lonely.

186
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:46,038
But I should be the one thanking you.

187
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:48,207
Because you always stuck with me.

188
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:53,379
Thank you for all the stories,
the laughter, the tears,

189
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:57,383

00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,252
This has been Sleep with Me.

191
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:01,420

193
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,201
[Kai] There.

194
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:18,270
Look. Perfect.

195
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:19,739
[Kai laughs]

196
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:21,874
But it's not like this date
is important, right?

197
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,246
-Harry.
-Yes?

198
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:29,682
I'm happy you're happy.

[laughs softly]

200
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:35,154
Because that means

201
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:38,124
you won't be moping around anymore.

Say goodbye to your allowance next week.

204
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,766
Can you relax?

205
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:52,738
Remember, being stressed before a date
isn't a good look.

206
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:53,639
Okay, okay.

207
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:55,708
When did you become a dating expert?

208
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,877
I'm no expert.

209
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,145

He stopped responding.

214

Huh?

215
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:16,762
You okay?

216
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:18,697
Of course.

217
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:20,332
It's his loss.

218
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,702
Anyway, I'll just focus on my studies.

219
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:25,237
[chuckles] Wow.

220
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:27,106
Okay.

221
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:29,608
There. You look good.

222
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,344
Isn't it better to wear my hair up?

223
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:34,146
It'll look good, right?

224
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:35,214
-Okay, sure.
-Okay.

225
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:36,615
I got you.

-Like this?
-Yes.

227
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:40,586
-It looks good on you.
-Make it pretty.

229
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:43,355

you gotta stop me from talking

until someone stops me, so…

Can't you tell?

297
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,317
The ramps are too steep
and it's so crowded.

00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:34,753
Right.

303
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:42,928
Nice to meet you.

304
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:46,198
Harry, if you want me to talk to
the manager about the ramp,

305
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:47,833
-I'm over there, okay?
-Yeah.

306
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:51,303
And you should try the scallops,
I know they're your favorite.

307
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:53,172
[Harry] Yeah.

308
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,874
[Belle] Oh, have you thought
about my offer?

309
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:57,176
We really need your help.

310
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,878
Let's just talk about it
some other time. Yeah?

311
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:01,647
-Okay?
-Okay.

312
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:02,614
Bye!

313
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,219
-Sorry.
-Um…

314
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:12,124
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

315
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:17,029
You should have told me
you didn't like it here…

316
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,531
I-I didn't think about…

317
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,600
Sorry. I'm so sorry. Maybe next time--

318
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,435
It's fine, I'm good.

319
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:25,137
Yeah, but still…

320
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:26,572
I'm really sorry.

321
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:28,040
I didn't realize that…

-Hey.
-Yeah, it is hard…

At least now, you know.

-For next time, right?
-Yeah.

325
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:35,013
Okay.

326
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,015
Sorry again.

327
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:38,217

328
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,151
[waiter] Sorry, ma'am.

329
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:40,285
Can you be more careful?

330
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:42,921
[Harry] Hey, it's okay.

331
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:44,590
He also did that before.

332
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:46,225
He didn't mean it.

333
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:54,299
You don't have to worry about me
all the time, okay?

334
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,336
Yeah. Well…

335
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:01,907
It gets lonely when
no one worries about you.

336
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:06,445
I'm sure lots of people worry about you.

337
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:08,180
I guess.

338
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:10,949
In an abstract sense.

339
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:15,754
But, it's different when someone worries
about you in real time, right?

340
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:16,688
You know, not…

341
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,025
not retroactively.

342
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,361
Not as an obligation.

343
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:25,564
If you know what I mean.

344
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:29,968
Well, starting today,

345
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,438
