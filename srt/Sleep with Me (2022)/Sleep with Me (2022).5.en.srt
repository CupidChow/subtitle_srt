Thank you.

[Harry knocks] Hi.

7
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,571
[interviewer] So, Harry, thank you
for coming in for the interview.

8
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:13,156
Did you have a hard time
finding our office?

9
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:17,035
Actually, the PWD ramp
in the main entrance was closed off

10
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:18,787
so I had to go around.

11
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,122
I'm lucky the guard
was very helpful though.

12
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:24,250
Um, and your office is quite hard
to get through,

13
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,169
but I'm just glad I wasn't late.

14
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,006
It says here you graduated cum laude.

15
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:31,007
[Harry] Mm-hmm.

16
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,509
That's unexpected.

17
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:35,512
I was able to finish my studies

18
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,347
while holding down a full-time job.

19
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,224
With a lot of help, of course.

20
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,643
But I don't think it was unexpected.

21
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:43,895
[interviewer laughs] Yes, of course.

22
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:47,106
Harry, your CV is impressive.

23
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:47,982
Thanks.

24
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,276
In fact, you're overqualified.

25
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:51,736
Really?

26
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,695
Mm-hmm.

27
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,197
I don't think so.

28
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:55,824
I'm willing to work my way up,

29
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:59,911
especially since this is such a different
career from my previous job,

30
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:02,747
but I'm happy to put in the hours.

31
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,582
Yes, I don't doubt that.

I've been living fairly independently.

And I'm sure, with certain accommodations,

37
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,431
I'll not only be able to contribute here

38
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,559
but thrive here as well.

39
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:23,393

Of course.

69
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,355
Maybe that's why I feel so lost.

00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:54,359
You can still change your mind, okay?

00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,047
You know?

184
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,758
To make concessions or…

185
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,052
to adjust.

186
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:39,680
It's funny that we're always the ones
that need to adjust.

187
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:50,399
Well, Kai says I should use this time
to find my next great love.

188
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:55,655
So I was thinking,
maybe I'll go back to school?

189
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:59,408
Take a short course or another master's.

190
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,244
Mm.

191
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:05,456
But I'm not in a hurry.

192
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:06,666
I mean,

193
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,210
I can be your trophy girlfriend.

194
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,968
So if… [clears throat]

195
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:22,848
If you go back to school,

196
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,935
you'll have to go back to normal hours?

197
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,604
It depends.

198
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,565
There are lots of night classes.

199
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:33,651
You can come with me.

200
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:34,693
[scoffs]

201
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:38,572
Hey.

202
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:39,949
What's wrong?

203
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:45,579
Nothing, it's just…

204
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,168
I guess, I just miss you.

205
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:54,755
I feel like

206
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,968
you know, you're about to enter
this whole different world

207
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,928
without me, and…

208
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:06,559
I don't know. I guess, it makes me wonder

209
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:09,895
if we're really compatible.

210
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,774
It's like we live in two different worlds.

211
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:17,736
Hey, I'm sorry.

212
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:21,574
I know it's hard for you

213
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,577
that we seldom see each other.

214
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:30,958
But let's just make
the most out of tonight.

215
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:34,420
Yeah?

216
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:44,054
When I was a kid, I used to dream about
finding people who were like me.

217
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,557
You know?

218
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,643
People I could build a world with.

219
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:54,482
Where we'd go to school
and to work at night.

220
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,319
Instead of working from
9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.,

221
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,945
it'd be from 5:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m.

222
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,242
I'd wake up in the afternoon

223
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:09,497
and walk to school
while watching the sunset.

224
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:16,045
Then, no one would ask me
why I don't have energy, or…

225
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:20,883
why I'm "lazy."

226
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,886
I guess that would be the only time
I'd get to experience

227
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,181
what it's like to be "normal."

228
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,018
I'll come with you.

229
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,853
[scoffs]

230
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,564
[Luna] You won't like it there.

231
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,567
Why not? You'll be there.

232
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,404
Game?

233
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,032
Okay?

234
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,117
Let's do it.

235
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:51,205
Let's build a world
that's just for the two of us.

236
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,793
Yeah?

237
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,838
[Harry] Next time,
I'll be the one to cook.

238
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,966
And I promise, I won't be late.

239
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,702
[phone vibrates]

240
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:37,251
WHERE ARE YOU? LET'S HAVE A DRINK.

241
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,104
[door opens]

242
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,899
[Whammy] Kai, let's just go. You're drunk.

243
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:43,609
[Kai] Last round.

244
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,444
[Whammy] You already
said that a while ago.

245
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,738
Fine, but take it slow, okay?

246
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,990
[Kai] Miss, do you have Amaretto Sour?

247
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:50,908
Luna?

248
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,785
Oh, Kai.

249
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,370
Who's with Harry?

250
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,373
Well, I just went out for a bit
to get a drink.

251
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,583
You can't do that.

252
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,210
What if she needs something?

253
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,419
Kai--

254
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:03,963
What if she wakes up and no one's around?

255
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,172
-[Whammy] Kai, calm down.
-[Kai] You know…

256
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:06,924
-[Whammy] Babe, let's go.
-…you're being selfish.

257
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,093
[Kai] You're only thinking about yourself.

258
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:10,469
Kai, I'm sure she can handle herself.

259
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:12,596
I've been here
for less than ten minutes, okay?

260
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,722
What if she can't?

261
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,518
You left her in an unfamiliar place.

262
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:20,688
Kai, she's in my apartment.
I'm sure she'll be fine.

263
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:21,897
-[Kai] Luna--
-I'm done, okay?

264
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:22,856
You don't get it.

265
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,400
Okay, I'm going.

266
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,442
[door opens]

267
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:29,363
[Whammy] Where are you going,
babe? Wait for me.

268
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,032
[line ringing]

269
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,205
Hey.

270
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,331
Harry.

271
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:40,874
What happened?

272
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,544
No, I'm sorry, I was trying to…

273
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,088
-Are you okay?
-I'm sorry, I ruined your plant.

274
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,506
No, it's okay. But are you…?

275
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:49,466
Yeah, no, no. I'm okay.
I'm okay. Don't worry.

276
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,592
You sure? Oh my God.

277
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,553
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

278
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:55,264
No, no, no, I… I'm sorry.

279
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,474
-You should have called or texted me.
-It's okay.

280
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,059
-I'm okay, don't worry.
-Just…

281
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,310
-Harry!
-[Harry] Oh?

282
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,812
What happened?

283
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,606
-Nothing. I'm okay, guys.
-Are you sure you're okay?

284
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,233
I'm sorry. I…

285
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:07,651
I didn't mean for this to happen, but…

286
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:10,112
-Hey, it's okay. I'm fine.
-No, but…

287
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,948
-It's fine.
-You know what, let's go.

288
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,575
[Kai] We're going home.

289
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,288
Luna, I have to go.
But I'll call you, okay?

290
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,498
-I love you.
-Yeah.

291
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,125
[Harry] Hey, don't worry, okay?

292
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,419
[Kai] Harry.

Hello?

00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,919
Hey. Are you okay?

299
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:50,796
I'm sorry.

300
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,510
Wait, Luna.

301
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:58,554
Hello?

302
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,312
I need some time to think.

303
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,153
Okay.

304
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,284
I don't think I can do this anymore.

[scoffing chuckle]

306
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,208
That was fast.

307
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,460
I can't take care of you, Harry.

308
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,881
I can't even take care of myself.

309
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:41,471
After all this time,
that's how you see me?

310
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,184
Someone that needs to be cared for?

311
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,603
We all need to be taken care of.

312
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:53,483
You need to be cared for,
and I need to be cared for.

313
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:57,154
And the thing that happened
yesterday is just…

314
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,698
[Luna] It's gonna happen again.

315
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,158
You know, I'm just…

316
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,119
I'm just gonna fuck it up again.

317
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:09,583
So you're ending things
before anything can even happen?

318
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,003
[Harry] Luna.

319
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:16,340
Why don't you give yourself a chance…

320
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,135
to be happy?

321
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,101
Harry, don't you see?

322
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:31,146
You're sacrificing so many things
for this relationship.

323
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,272
Sacrificing?

324
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,275
What? What am I sacrificing?

325
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,401
[Luna] So many things.

326
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:39,154

Can we please just stop pretending

329
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,868
that we… we can handle this

330
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,745
because, obviously, we can't.

331
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:51,416
You just need to be with someone

332
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,669
who can be there for you, you know?

333
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,213
And someone who knows
how to be there for you,

334
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,465
and someone who can make you happy.

335
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,926
And I'm just not.

Please.

00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,112

342
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:40,382

344
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:45,512
[Harry] Okay.
