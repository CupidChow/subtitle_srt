[woman] Hi, Luna!

6
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:49,709
I know you're supposed to be asleep
right now, so don't answer this.

7
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,344
But, I just wanted to remind you,

8
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:54,314
I'm gonna call you later
from the auditorium.

9
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,184
And no worries, though,
if the timing doesn't work out.

10
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:00,954
I can video call when
we go home for lunch.

11
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:04,157
Love you, Luna, and good night.

12
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:07,327
I mean, good morning, and sleep tight.

Hello?

18
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:14,794
[woman] Hello, Luna. How are you?

19
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:15,962
Did I wake you?

20
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,631
No, I'm already up.

21
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:21,568
Actually, I've been working.

22
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:23,836
[woman] Good. We need you
to come to the office.

23
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:28,074
We have some questions about
the draft you sent over.

24
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:30,610
The physics textbook.

25
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:32,412
Okay, sure.

26
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:34,047
I'll be there.

27
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:35,582
[woman] Is there a problem?

28
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:40,053
No, no, no, it's fine. I'll be there.

29
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:41,221
Okay.

30
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:44,123
Then I'll send you an email
about the date and time.

31
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,592
-[Luna] See you.
-See you.

32
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:46,759
Thank you.

00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:25,598
Nope. You were crying the whole time.

36
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:28,901
I barely watched the movie because
I was just laughing at you.

37
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:31,237
Hey.

38
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:33,806
-[Kai] Belle.
-Hi.

39
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:36,209
I just missed your sister's cooking.

40
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,279
Gross.

41
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:40,647
Join us.

42
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:41,881
Have you eaten?

43
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,783
Wow. Do you even live here?

44
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:47,186
I'll eat later. I lost my appetite.

45
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,091
[door closes]

46
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:53,293
[Belle] Hey.

47
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,663
So, do you mind looking through these?

48
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:58,631
Yeah, sure. Sure.

49
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:02,168
Um, yeah. In my free time.

50
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,775
You know, I feel bad that I ask you
to do this all the time

51
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:11,778
when I should be paying you.

52
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:14,347
No, no, it's okay.

53
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:16,082
For the kids, right?

54
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,552
Why don't you just come work for us?

55
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:24,424
I like the job I have now.

56
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:28,294
Yeah, I know. But it's like…

57
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:31,197
Okay.

58
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,800
We already broke up so I can say this.

59
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:38,838
And I mean this
in the best way possible, okay?

60
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:43,276
I feel like you're wasting your potential.

61
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:49,615
Well, like you said, we broke up, so…

62
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,584
Okay, okay.

63
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:53,653
I can take a hint.

64
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:57,490
But, if you ever change your mind…

65
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,628
About?

66
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:05,064
About the job.

67
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:08,134
Or, you know, about us.

68
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,738
You know where to find me.

69
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,978

[music slowly fades]

72
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,629
[woman] We left at 10:15
when I wanted to leave at 10

73
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:39,332
so we didn't get time to get coffee again.

74
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,368
You know how Mom is. She moves so slowly.

75
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:45,304
But, I'm so happy!

76
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:46,639
It's such a great feeling, it's different.

77
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:49,308
It's like the universe pushed me
to graduate.

78
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:52,378
And it feels so good to achieve
something, you know?

79
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,082
Mm. I'm so proud of you. Congrats, Li.

80
00:06:58,184 --> 00:06:59,719
I'm actually so hungry.

81
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:01,154
You know, I haven't eaten all day,

82
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:05,258
and Mom prepared a feast
with all my favorites.

83
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:06,726
Wow, sounds good.

84
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:09,962
How about you?

85
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,798
Don't you ever think about…

86
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:13,332
about graduating?

87
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,335
Yeah, but…

88
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:19,172
It's not the same for me
as it is for you, Li.

89
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:20,606
So…

90
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:22,008
But things are changing, right?

91
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:24,644
And there are other ways.

92
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,712
Why are we talking about me?

93
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:30,716
It's your day today so we should be,
you know, focusing on you.

94
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:31,751
So… [laughs]

95
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:33,219
[Lia] Just because you're different,

96
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,254
you don't have to hide yourself
from the world.

97
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:38,424
[Luna] Yeah.

98
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:41,093
I have to go, Li.

99
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,030
Sorry, I just have so much work to do, so.

100
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:45,698
[Lia] Wait, Luna.

101
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:48,968
Sorry. I didn't mean to.

102
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:51,037
[Luna] No, no. It's fine, it's not…

103
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,739
It's not about that.
I just have a lot to do.

104
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,843
But, yeah, I just wanted to say
congratulations, okay?

105
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:59,312
Okay. I love you.

106
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:00,246
[Lia] Bye!

107
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,214
[call ends]

108
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:04,917
[sighs]

109
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:08,421
[Kai grunts]

110
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,259
Boy problems?

111
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:15,828
-Yup.
-[Harry sighs]

112
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,069
How about you?

113
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,505
Girl problems?

114
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:28,541
Yup.

115
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,210
Fine, ladies first.

116
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:36,682
I met her at the station the other night.

117
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:38,217
Was she a bitch?

118
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,287
How did you know?

119
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:44,457
Bitchy girls are your type.

120
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,892
Hey, watch it!

121
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,693
You like guys who look like they're dumb.

122
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:49,495
Wow.

123
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:50,663
Ouch.

124
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,233
So, she went there to claim a prize,

125
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,701
but

126
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:58,471
she left before I even got her name.

127
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,740
Okay. So hopeless case?

128
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:03,943
Hopeless case, your ass.

129
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,044
Rude.

130
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,816
It's so hard.

131
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,019
I'm not sure if he likes me.

132
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,655
I'm sure he does.

133
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,590
How would you know?

134
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:18,925
I just do.

135
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,927
Everyone likes you.

136
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:21,827
[sighs deeply]

137
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,997
It's so hard to be gay
in the 21st century.

138
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,600
You're such a drama queen.

139
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,035
Help me.

140
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:30,870
Please.

141
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,640
Does he listen to my show?

142
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,842
Really? That's your question?

143
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,445
Not, is he a registered voter?

144
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,547
Is he homophobic or a misogynist?

145
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:44,016
There are a lot of
deal-breakers, you know.

146
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,485
I have an idea.

147
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:49,422
Join me at the station later?

148
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:51,524
No, thanks. It's so boring there.

149
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:53,626
You're so mean.

150
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:56,195
Is that a side effect
of your one-sided love?

151
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,565
Fine.

152
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,400
Make sure he's listening.

153
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:06,806
[gentle music playing]

154
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:18,284
-[Harry] Joe.
-Harry.

155
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:19,652
Where are you going?

156
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:21,854
I was laid off.

157
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:23,823
What?

158
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:28,160
Advertisers are pulling out
so they're cutting costs.

159
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:29,195
Have you heard anything?

160
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:31,631
No, I haven't.

161
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,601
This is my girlfriend, Jenny.

162
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:39,472
What happened to you?

163
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,676
Shark attack.

164
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:44,844
In Cebu.

165
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,078
When I was twelve.

166
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:48,180
OMG, babe! I knew it.

167
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:50,650
We should never go swimming again.

168
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:52,418
How did it happen?

169
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:55,521
I tried fighting back

170
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:57,757
since I have a green belt in taekwondo.

171
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:01,227
When it started biting my legs,

172
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:04,030
I punched it really hard
so I could escape.

173
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,265
You're so brave.

174
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,367
You know, I can't live like that.

175
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:11,337
Uh… we'll get going now. Come on.

176
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,339
Wait, babe. Can you take a picture of us?

177
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:14,540
-Huh?
-Just one.

178
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,475
You're so inspirational.

179
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:20,379
-[Joe] Harry, sorry.
-I have a lot of work to do, sorry.

180
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:21,614
Sorry, Harry.

181
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,015
Come on, babe.

182
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:24,250
[Joe] Bye, Harry.

183
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:25,551
Take care.

184
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:26,686
[Joe] Good luck.

185
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:27,853
[Jenny] Just one photo…

186
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,088
-[Joe] Stop it.
-Thanks.

187
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,397
[gentle music fades]

188
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:46,906
[Wendy] Luna. Hello. [laughs]

189
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,375
Did you get it?

190
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:50,676
[clatters]

191
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:53,946
Where's my prize?

192
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,616
You need to come back during office hours.

193
00:11:57,683 --> 00:11:59,852
You should've claimed it earlier.

194
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:00,820
Really? Wow.

195
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,055
Besides, it's too early for me.

196
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,460
What a bitch.

197
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:09,495
[Harry] Imagine this.

198
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,531
You're dating someone for three months.

199
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:14,066
And then you find out

200
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:19,271
they like pineapples on their pizza.

201
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:20,206
[laughs]

202
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:26,812
Some things are really hard to accept
and you can't explain why.

203
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,180
I know it's shallow,

204
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:31,717
but, that's exactly what
a deal-breaker is, right?

205
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:34,587
It's like a personal preference.

206
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:39,759
[Harry, muffled] Now, we'll be reading
your own deal-breakers.

207
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:41,761
Not religious.

208
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:43,929
Doesn't support local music.

209
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:48,434
[muffled] Takes too long to reply,
a deal-breaker, I see.

210
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:50,536
Being a snob.

211
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,571
Okay, that's a given.

212
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:54,673
[Harry on radio]
Those are basic deal-breakers, but

213
00:12:54,740 --> 00:13:00,012
here, we have something
a bit deeper from B-BOY-C.

214
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,415
He says this is a deal-breaker for him:

215
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:07,386
bad hygiene and lack of ambition.

216
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,854
Agree, agree.

217
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:11,624
You need someone
that you can grow with, right?

218
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,058
Bordaqueen says that

219
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:17,963
one deal-breaker for her
is public confessions.

220
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,698
I get it. It makes sense.

221
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:23,569
Some people are more shy
about these things.

222
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:30,476
But, you all know that
I'm a hopeless romantic.

223
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,344
I love grand gestures.

224
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:35,614
And, I think it's better
to let people know

225
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:39,351
who my crush is so they can back off.

226
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:43,455
[muffled] So, now, we have a guest
here in the studio.

227
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:47,827
We're going to help him out
with something.

228
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:52,498
And what he wants to know is…

229
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:56,435
Whammy, if you're listening.

230
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:59,905
[muffled] Kai has
a really big crush on you.

231
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:01,807
Does he have a chance with you?

232
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,850
Yes, guys! Whammy said yes!

233
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:14,820
My brother isn't a hopeless case.

234
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:16,555
[Kai] Yeah!

235
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:20,192
And since we're not a family of cowards,

236
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,494
well, not anymore,

237
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,029
it's my turn.

238
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:30,402
[normal voice] To the girl I met
at the station the other night.

239
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:34,506
Wendy's friend who is really nice.

240
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:36,976
[Harry on radio] I'll be waiting.

241
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,478
I hope you come.

242
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,713
-Oh my God!
-[Harry] Because…

243
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:43,616
Because…

244
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:44,884
I have a huge crush on you.

245
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,019
[Harry on radio] Even if you're a bitch.

246
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:47,920
[Wendy] Hey!

247
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:49,622
Hey, Luna!

248
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:52,057
Did you hear that?

249
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:53,292
She likes you!

250
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,527
What are you still doing here?

251
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:57,863
Shouldn't you be running to her?

252
00:14:58,697 --> 00:14:59,965
Luna!

253
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:01,100
Maybe I won't.

254
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:03,002
Why not?

255
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,937
She's not your type?

256
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:06,171
Bad first impression?

257
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,808
No.

258
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:12,678
Actually,

259
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:15,781
I like her.

260
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,449
There you go!

261
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:20,319
What are you still doing here?

262
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,422
Don't keep her waiting!

263
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:25,791
You don't want to?

264
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:28,127
-If you're not going to, I will.
-Hey!

265
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:29,561
-Let me call her.
-Give it back!

266
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:31,430
-Hello? Harry?
-Give it to me!

267
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:33,365
-Hey, I like you.
-Stop it!

268
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,100
-[clatters]
-[Wendy laughing]

269
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:42,107
Don't worry, I'll take care of this, okay?

270
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,176
Come on, have some fun.

271
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:45,311
-You should go.
-Okay. Okay.

272
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:46,378
Believe in love!

273
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,113
-Here you go.
-Fine, give me back my phone.

274
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,782
Here. Go, go, go!

275
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:51,850
Don't forget my prize, okay?

276
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:53,819
Luna! Bye-bye! [chuckles]

277
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:56,655
I'M EXCITED

278
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:58,490
Hey. Happy?

279
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,392
Super.

280
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:02,594
Thank you.

281
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:08,867
It's okay.

282
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:10,769
-Maybe she fell asleep.
-[Harry scoffs]

283
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,539
Or worked overtime.

284
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,642
Or maybe her radio is broken.

285
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:17,710
[Harry laughs]

286
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:19,411
Yeah, sure.

287
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,747
It's okay. It's her loss.

288
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:22,881
Okay.

289
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:24,616
You're right. I'm a catch.

290
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:25,918
-Right?
-Of course.

291
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,620
So, when's your date with Whammy?

292
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,557
Maybe, after exams?

293
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:33,659
Wow, responsible.

294
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,327
Let's pretend I believe you.

295
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:39,531
Hi.

296
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:42,501
[gentle music playing]

297
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,470
Uh… Harry.

298
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,006
I'm a huge fan.

299
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:50,776
I forgot to tell you the other night.

300
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:53,779
Thanks.

301
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:57,883
Usually, my listeners fall asleep on me,

302
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,385
so

303
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,720
I'm glad there's someone
who listens until the end.

304
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:08,861
[Kai] Um, anyway, let's go?

305
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:11,063
Uh… um…

306
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:13,632
Have you eaten?

307
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:27,079
[bright music playing]

308
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,332
[music ends]
