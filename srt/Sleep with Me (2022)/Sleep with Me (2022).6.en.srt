00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,084
[Wendy] So, you're ending it?

00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,211
[Luna sniffles, clicks tongue]

3
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:47,046
I don't think I can do this anymore.

4
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,132
Who told you that?

5
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,259
[Wendy] Luna.

6
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:53,428
I did.

00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,185
Because…

10
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:03,021
she's too good for me.

11
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,107
Ugh.

12
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,193
I'm scared.

13
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:09,986
Why?

14
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,906
Because

15
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:17,702
it's gonna end anyway, so…

16
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,625
why prolong the agony, right?

17
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,961
[chuckles]

18
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,296
Hello!

19
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:30,673
Stop laughing!

20
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,509
Why aren't you taking me seriously?

21
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:33,843
[Luna] Bitch.

22
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,512
You're acting like an idiot.

23
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:38,932
-Damn you!
-You're being dumb.

24
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:40,141
Girl, you're so stupid.

25
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,476
I'm being serious!

26
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,978
You act like being in love is a curse.

27
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:46,439
Will the world end
if you let yourself love her?

28
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:47,482
You're so dramatic.

29
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,653
I can't help it.

30
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:56,157
She makes me feel too much and I just…

31
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,033
[Wendy chuckles]

32
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,786
Bitch, it's true.

33
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,454
It scares me!

34
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,706
Is this what love
is supposed to feel like?

35
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,335
[both laughing]

36
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,254
[Wendy] Yeah.

37
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:11,422
That's the way it is.

38
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:12,674
Really.

39
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,884
Love is scary.

40
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,096
But what can we do?

41
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,182
We just have to trust it.

42
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,061
[Wendy] Do you trust Harry?

43
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,689
Of course.

44
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,484
[Wendy] Do you trust yourself?

45

46
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,298
You'll be fine.

47
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:58,177
Hey, stop crying. You look stupid.

48
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,888
-Damn you.
-Stop crying.

49
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:02,056
-Stop!
-No wonder customers aren't coming in.

50
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,017
Crying is bad for sales.

51
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,435
Get a hold of yourself.

Harry…

56
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,261
Did you and Luna break up?

57
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,056
I'm not sure.

58
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,518
I think it's my fault.

59
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:48,770
Huh?

60
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,690
That Luna hasn't been around lately.

61
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:58,780
I got mad at her that night
I saw her at the bar.

62
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,991
You shouldn't have done that.

63
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,702
You shouldn't have interfered.

64
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,412
I'm sorry.

I'm just trying to take care of you.

67

You know that.

68
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:15,338
I know. But shouldn't I be the one
taking care of you?

69
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,925
I'm older, so it's like
our roles are reversed.

I feel guilty.

73
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:34,899

[indistinct chatter]

151
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:55,446
Most schools aren't founded
by persons with disabilities.

152
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:58,282
So, when someone like me goes there,

153
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,950
I feel like an outsider.

154
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:03,579
The decision-makers who make the
school's policies and practices

155
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:08,000
can actually choose to include
persons with disabilities,

156
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:11,629
or they can pretend that we don't exist.

157
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:14,215
If a student with a disability,
for example,

158
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:17,676
asks you for something that
hasn't been done before,

159
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,222
is your first instinct
to take action towards change,

160
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:22,932
or to say it can't be done?

161
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:26,644
If we're advocating
for competent, inclusive,

162
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:29,105
and accessible education for all

163
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,107
then don't you think we should include

164
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,318
persons with disabilities
in the conversation?

165
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,946

into our program,

so congratulations.

174
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:55,464
[Harry] Thanks.

175
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,549
Because of that,

176
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:57,800
I have a surprise for you.

177
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,218

00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:04,723
Okay, don't worry. She's cute.

181
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:08,769
I'm a bit cuter, but she's okay.

182
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,312
You

183
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,440
want to set me up with someone

184
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:13,858
who isn't you?

185
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:14,859
Yes.

00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,278
It's called character development.

187
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,071
And I want to give you

188
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,031
some friendly support this time around.

189
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:22,700
[chuckles] Okay.

190
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:26,537
Well, I'm happy about
your character development.

191
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,415
But, pass.

192
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,961
So, it's, like, really serious
between you two, huh?

193
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:35,671
I don't know.

194
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:37,506
I don't want to talk about it.

195
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,841
You sure?

196
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,135
You can talk to me. I'm your friend.

197
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:50,186
You know how there are some things
that you try to bury in your mind?

198
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,229
And you try to convince yourself

199
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,732
that it's this small, insignificant thing.

200
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:55,858
That you should move on

201
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:59,862
because there are
more important things in your life.

202
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,947
That you're okay.

203
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,657
You should be okay.

204
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:08,120
Not really. Sounds tiring.

205
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,205
That's the problem.

206
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,289
It's not.

207
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:11,790
It was easy.

208
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:15,920
It was so easy that I believed it fully.

209
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:20,716
Until I realized that this story

210
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,720
that I made up in my head
to make myself feel better

211
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:28,432
about how the person I love
screwed me over

212
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,893
so I should move on

213
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:34,104
and just forget about the whole thing.

214
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,691
Well,

215
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,319
it's not true.

216
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,074
It was nobody's fault.

217
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,869
Or maybe both our faults?

218
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,538
[sighs]

219
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,414
That's why it's hard.

220
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,376
Because no one is to blame.

221
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,881
Oh, sorry. Was that weird?

222
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,508
-Sorry, just forget it.
-[Belle] No, no.

223
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:03,509
Hey.

224
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:04,468
Sorry.

225
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,387
You can finish that later.

226
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,055
Let's just go out first.

227
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,723
Let's grab a drink, okay?

228
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,767
I'll just, I'll cancel
all my plans, it's okay.

229
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,561
No! No, no, no, no, no.

230
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,479
I'm fine. I can deal. It's okay.

231
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,605
Don't cancel your plans.

232
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,773
Harry.

233
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,483
Belle.

234
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,777
Let people be there for you.

235
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,657
[gentle music playing]

236
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:29,743
Fine.

237
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,121
[Harry] Meet you in the lobby in five?

238
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:32,955
Yes.

239
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:33,831
See you.

240
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,207
See you.

241
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,966
[Lia] Wait, I have a story.

242
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,469
So, Vicky went stargazing
with a guy at the beach

243
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,638
and she got sand in her eye.

244
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,473
So, she never took her shades off

245
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,893
and came back with the funniest tan line.

246
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,020
Don't share this with Mom

247
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:58,522
'cause she doesn't know
Vicky has a boyfriend.

248
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,857
No, I won't tell.

249
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,650
Your secret's safe with me.

250
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,529
Li, I miss you.

251
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,451
Look, I'm trying to hug you
through the screen.

252
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,912
I just wish someone was there
with you right now.

253
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:17,416
[Mom] Lia, your aunts are leaving.

254
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,376
You should see them out.

255
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,794
-Luna, I have to go.
-Okay.

256
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,714
[Mom] Lia, come quick.
Who are you still talking to?

257
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,466
Lia Marie, get down here now!

258
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,051
I bet you don't miss that.

259
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,095
I miss that and I miss all of you, guys.

260
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,681
Please tell everyone I miss them.

261
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:37,311
And teach them how to video call
so we can all talk.

262
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:40,189
It's a hassle, but okay. I miss you too.

263
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,440
I gotta go. Bye!

264
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:42,900
[kisses] Love you.

265
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:45,778
[sighs]

266
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,199
I'LL BE THERE.

267
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,417
[keys jangling]

268
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,678
Oh my God!

269
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,137
What happened?

270
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,890
Okay, I wanted to tell you first.

271
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,227
Cesca dropped by.

272
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,604
-Remember, my ex?
-Mm.

273
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:23,107
And I think… [giggles]

274
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:25,901
I think we're back together.

275
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,027
[giggles]

276
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,197
Why did you break up in the first place?

277
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:34,410
Well, it's really my fault.

278
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,579
I got scared and oversensitive.

279
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,456
Then…

280
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:45,504
I just wasn't ready at that time
so I made lots of excuses.

281
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:51,176
I placed a lot of unfair expectations
on my shoulders.

282
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:53,971
Yeah, that's it. Bad timing.

283
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:56,432
[clicks tongue]

284
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,350
So, you fixed it?

285
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:01,854
You're okay now?
I missed the exciting part?

286
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,439
You're back together now?

287
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,941
I know, I know. It seems sudden.

288
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,944
It's different when

289
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,572
you have a history with someone.

290
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:15,284
All of the weight,

291
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:21,123
all the expectations and false hopes…

292
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:24,960
It just feels good when you find out

293
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,629
that you can work on things together.

294
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,673
That…

295
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,675
you can figure things out together.

296
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,597
Is that always the case?

297
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,765
[Wendy] Is what?

298
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:41,894
Those things you said earlier.
About missed chances.

299
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,729
Anxiety.

300
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:46,815
The uncertainty and the fear.

301
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,901
How do I explain?

302
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:52,738
You can't just focus on
all the things that can go wrong.

303
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:56,033
[Wendy] You also can't be
scared all the time.

304
00:17:56,658 --> 00:18:00,287
Love is worth working hard for.

305
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:05,501
[bright instrumental music playing]

306
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:39,535
Hi.

307
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,124
Hello.

308
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,418
[nervous chuckle]

309
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,341
Ah, is this seat taken?

310
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,511
Depends.

311
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,353
Are you planning to stay?

312
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,820
If you let me.

313
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,583
Um…

314
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,361
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

315
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:00,490
So…

316
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,242
-How are you?
-When did you…

317
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,079
-I just wanted to…
-You go first.

318
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,418
Ah…

319
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,922
Sorry. I forgot what I was gonna say.

320
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,173
[Harry laughs]

321
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:22,971
I know.

322
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,600
Let's pretend that

323
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:30,395
we've known each other for a long time.

324
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,689
[Harry] Game?

325
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,150
Game.

326
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:41,073
[Luna] Hey, Harry.

327
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,449
[chuckles]

328
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,119
Go on a date with me?

329
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:53,752
Yes?

330
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:54,795
Yes.

331
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:57,422
[indistinct chatter]

332
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:03,679
[bright instrumental music playing]

333
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,814
[laughing]

334
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,653
[music slowly fading]

335
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:24,241
[gentle music playing]

336
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:26,715
[music ends]
