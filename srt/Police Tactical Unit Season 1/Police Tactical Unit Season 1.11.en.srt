1
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:45,800
Qian Junjie

2
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,560
Tell us

3
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,680
what happened at that time.

4
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,680
Yesterday at noon,

5
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,000
they took me

6
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,280
to an abandoned factory.

7
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,400
They started beating me

8
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,680
and forced me

9
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,160
to call my dad.

10
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,360
Later,

11
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,280
Qian Junjie,

12
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,760
try to recall carefully.

13
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,160
The more details you give,

14
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,520
the sooner we catch them.

15
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,040
Go ahead and ask.

16
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,520
Did the suspect

17
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,400
have any distinguishing features?

18
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,920
Two men.

19
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,240
Their age was about

20
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,760
thirty to forty years old.

21
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,680
They both wore masks,

22
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,640
so I couldn't see their faces.

23
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,120
Medium build.

24
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,000
Have you offended anyone lately?

25
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,360
No.

26
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,760
Honestly,

27
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,040
I think they were

28
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,920
after my dad.

29
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,520
I feel what they wanted

30
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,480
was my dad's life.

31
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,000
At first,

32
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,280
the kidnappers said

33
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,480
they wanted five million.

34
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,480
My dad said there wasn't enough time

35
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,880
to gather that much money.

36
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,360
He only had one million in cash.

37
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,400
They agreed right away.

38
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,160
Just "medium build"

39
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,800
and "middle-aged"—

40
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,760
these two clues

41
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,360
are meaningless.

42
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,400
It's too broad.

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,760
Qian Junjie's family is well-off,

44
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,480
but we can't rule out

45
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,760
the possibility of kidnapping for ransom

46
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,240
just because the kidnappers

47
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,120
didn't take the money.

48
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,760
Xiaoyu sent over

49
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,280
the Sheng Xiaole suicide case

50
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,560
file.

51
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,000
The time of Sheng Xiaole's suicide

52
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,160
was in twenty-three,

53
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,280
April fourteenth.

54
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,880
That's exactly one year ago today.

55
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,760
Doesn't this suggest

56
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,880
the two cases are connected?

57
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,360
Form bold hypotheses,

58
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,040
but verify carefully.

59
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,800
Let Xiao Chen stay here with Qian Junjie.

60
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,760
Let's go back to the scene.

61
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,080
Let's go.

62
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,480
Split up and search.

63
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,000
Look for clues.

64
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:51,840
Lu Ming.

65
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,000
Lu Ming.

66
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,880
Isn't this the tank Minmin mentioned?

67
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,800
Let's check and see.

68
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,600
Another body found.

69
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,960
It's not cold.

70
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,440
What's going on?

71
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,920
The forensics report is out.

72
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,640
Qian Junjie's kidnapping case.

73
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,280
At the crime scene,

74
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,440
there are old

75
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,360
blood spatter marks on the wall.

76
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,800
Secure the scene.

77
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,720
I'll coordinate with Director Shi

78
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,280
to merge the cases.

79
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:56,920
Let's go.

80
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,200
The results are in.

81
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,280
The body is female.

82
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,360
About twenty years old.

83
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,520
DNA extracted from the bones

84
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,920
matches a missing persons list.

85
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,200
The victim's name is Zhen Xiaoyu.

86
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,440
Her family reported her missing last year.

87
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,360
Later,

88
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,360
they thought she had run away.

89
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,360
Have you notified the family?

90
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:15,520
Yes.

91
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,800
They'll collect her belongings tomorrow.

92
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,560
Practice with me.

93
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,640
Come on.

94
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,080
Let's summarize.

95
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,440
Report.

96
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,200
Weren't you given time off?

97
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:36,920
Why are you here?

98
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,120
I came to listen.

99
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,360
Maybe

100
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,320
I can

101
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,200
offer some clues.

102
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,520
Just here to observe.

103
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,640
The breakthrough in this case

104
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,120
is

105
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,680
Zhen Xiaoyu.

106
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:49,800
Have you found anything?

107
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,960
Zhen Xiaoyu was a student at

108
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,080
Rongcheng Aviation Academy, majoring in flight attendant.

109
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,880
From her parents' social circles,

110
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,760
she had no overlap with Sheng Xiaole

111
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,240
or Qian Junjie.

112
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,600
No connection at all.

113
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,760
The day Zhen Xiaoyu disappeared,

114
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,360
she added a new WeChat friend.

115
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,360
It was through "People Nearby."

116
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:05,920
Xiaoyu,

117
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,640
did you find anything?

118
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,880
The WeChat used an original ID,

119
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,960
not linked to a phone number.

120
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,520
And the Moments

121
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,200
were only up for a short time.

122
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,480
I feel like

123
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,760
this account was made just

124
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,200
for

125
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,360
picking up young girls.

126
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,880
But these photos are real,

127
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,520
not from the internet.

128
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,520
And this account

129
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,800
was used for a while last year

130
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,600
then quickly deleted.

131
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,080
Can I see one?

132
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,960
I've been in this car.

133
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,520
It's Qian Junjie's car.

134
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,120
Qilu Liya.

135
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,480
Surveil Qian Junjie immediately.

136
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,480
He's not telling the truth.

137
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,520
Hello, Captain Lu.

138
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,880
Xiaoyu has already recovered

139
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,920
Zhen Xiaoyu's phone data.

140
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,040
Her last contact

141
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:12,880
was Qian Junjie.

142
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,320
How are things on your end?

143
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,200
This guy never leaves his house.

144
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,640
He relies on delivery for food.

145
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,360
Bring him in first.

146
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,200
To assist with the investigation.

147
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:20,960
Let's pressure him a bit first.

148
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:21,680
Got it.

149
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:23,680
Officer Lu.

150
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,800
It's about the kidnapping case.

151
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,480
Any new developments?

152
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,680
We summoned you today

153
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,680
for another case.

154
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:33,520
Take a look.

155
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,240
Do you recognize her?

156
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,360
I'll tell you everything.

157
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:38,760
I was

158
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,800
kidnapped twice by

159
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,640
the same group.

160
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,560
Last year,

161
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,560
around this same time.

162
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:46,880
Babe.

163
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,640
You had fun drinking tonight.

164
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,200
Babe.

165
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,920
Babe, you look amazing.

166
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,200
Look at those legs.

167
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,640
I'm just saying,

168
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,000
you met up with your pretty online friend,

169
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,240
and dragged me, a single guy,

170
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:01,920
here for what?

171
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,200
Bro,

172
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,520
what are you talking about?

173
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,120
That girl is Zhen Xiaoyu,

174
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,320
right?

175
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,880
I got you a friend tonight.

176
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,880
If you don't like her, that's on you.

177
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,520
I don't like her.

178
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,000
Let's talk about it later.

179
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,800
You're a rich kid,

180
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,000
why not hire a driver?

181
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:16,640
If you

182
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,760
get caught,

183
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,120
that's at least a month in jail.

184
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,760
I might end up in there too.

185
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,880
You're dragging me down with you.

186
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,560
What's there to be afraid of?

187
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,640
No cops in the suburbs.

188
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,320
Right?

189
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,520
Besides,

190
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,360
this car

191
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,680
my dad just bought for me.

192
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,440
Letting someone else drive it,

193
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,320
I wouldn't feel safe.

194
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,120
Alright, fine.

195
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:36,560
What's wrong?

196
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,560
Slow down.

197
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,240
Babe.

198
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,640
Wake up, Xiaole.

199
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:58,720
Xiaole.

200
00:09:59,280 --> 00:09:59,960
Are you okay?

201
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:04,640
I...

202
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,520
My head is spinning.

203
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,120
Are we dreaming?

204
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,840
Are you sure

205
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,160
the two groups who kidnapped you

206
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,120
were the same people?

207
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,120
I'm sure.

208
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:13,800
Did they mention

209
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,600
why they targeted you?

210
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,000
I remember

211
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,600
one of the kidnappers

212
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,800
said kids like us,

213
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,480
rich kids, all deserve to die.

214
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,600
But according to our investigation,

215
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,360
Sheng Xiaole

216
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,160
isn't really

217
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:24,920
a rich kid, right?

218
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,400
The target was you.

219
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,480
At first,

220
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,840
I thought so too.

221
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,560
But after what happened,

222
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,280
I think the kidnappers

223
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,240
were after all of us.

224
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,920
When Xiaole's dad was alive,

225
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,480
his family ran a business.

226
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,680
They weren't poor.

227
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,240
Wait a second.

228
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,680
You mentioned something happened later.

229
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,160
What was it?

230
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,480
These things

231
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,480
have weighed on me for so long.

232
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,040
For over a year,

233
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,360
I haven't eaten or slept well.

234
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,720
Today, I'll tell you everything.

235
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,800
The kidnappers

236
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,720
forced us to play a Death Game.

237
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,120
Death Game.

238
00:10:59,640 --> 00:10:59,760
No...

239
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,320
Don't kill me...

240
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:00,840
No...

241
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,280
Don't kill me...

242
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:03,840
Miss,

243
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,720
play a game with us two.

244
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,960
Within fifteen minutes,

245
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:07,960
choose one of these two

246
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,080
for me to kill.

247
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,600
We'll guarantee your safety.

248
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,960
After fifteen minutes,

249
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,840
if both are still alive,

250
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,760
then you'll be the one to die.

251
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:17,600
Come on.

252
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,280
Take this.

253
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,040
We're watching you.
