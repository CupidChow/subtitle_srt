1
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:16,960
Come in.

2
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:22,760
Chief Shi

3
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,080
Lu Ming

4
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,960
How's the Jincheng case going?

5
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:26,720
Oh.

6
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,200
I'm here this time

7
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,320
to report on this matter.

8
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:29,720
So, how is it?

9
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,200
Running into trouble, aren't you?

10
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,080
Captain Ji said

11
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,880
this case is very similar to the one

12
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:35,840
from thirteen years ago.

13
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,200
He wants to apply for a joint investigation.

14
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,320
Any other evidence?

15
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,600
Not at the moment.

16
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,640
Old Ji, that guy,

17
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,520
is almost retired,

18
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,760
but still keeps us on our toes.

19
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,320
Hmm.

20
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,280
We can try following his lead.

21
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,840
Do you also think this case

22
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,520
was committed by one person?

23
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,080
I trust your instincts and skills.

24
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,400
Go ahead with the joint case.

25
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,280
Yes.

26
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:12,640
Here's the situation.

27
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,600
Thirteen years ago,

28
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,080
in Weicheng District,

29
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,040
there was

30
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,080
the Weicheng Sewer Dismemberment Case.

31
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,640
The killer was

32
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:21,840
male.

33
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,320
After investigation,

34
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:24,760
the victims

35
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:25,760
were

36
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,520
two

37
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,840
nightclub hostesses.

38
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,200
The killer used

39
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:30,880
torture

40
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,200
and forced confessions

41
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:32,960
to get

42
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,440
the victims' bank card PINs,

43
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,640
then murdered them brutally.

44
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:38,600
From

45
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,160
the remains left at

46
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,200
the crime scene,

47
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,280
the victims'

48
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,520
fingers

49
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,080
were broken before death.

50
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,960
Same method as the Jincheng Dismemberment Case.

51
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:48,840
Back then,

52
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,760
the case was

53
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,280
solved quickly by fingerprints

54
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,280
left at the scene.

55
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,080
Jin Weihua

56
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,040
was identified and pursued.

57
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,200
But

58
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,960
during the arrest,

59
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,880
he managed to escape.

60
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,200
To this day,

61
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,080
he hasn't been caught.

62
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,280
Boss.

63
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,440
Give me a pack of Tianzi, twenty.

64
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:25,880
Alright.

65
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,880
The victim is a woman.

66
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,960
I recently checked

67
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,840
missing persons reports.

68
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,520
A foot massage parlor owner said

69
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,080
a sister duo from his shop

70
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,160
went missing four days ago.

71
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,840
The younger sister

72
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,960
matches the victim's appearance.

73
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,880
The victim's name is Lin Fang,

74
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,560
twenty-two years old.

75
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,040
Her older sister is Lin Li,

76
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,040
twenty-five years old.

77
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:49,760
The two of them

78
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,520
were officially

79
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,480
foot massage parlor employees,

80
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,040
but actually provided sexual services.

81
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,800
They were known as the Sister Duo.

82
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,240
Whenever they worked,

83
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,160
they always went together.

84
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,880
According to the parlor owner's statement,

85
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,000
after the Sister Duo went out for work,

86
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,040
they never returned.

87
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,160
After DNA sequencing,

88
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,160
we can confirm

89
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,400
the remains we found

90
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,640
belong to the younger sister, Lin Fang.

91
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,040
As for the older sister, Lin Li,

92
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,280
she is likely also dead.

93
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,640
These two sisters

94
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,360
had savings over the years.

95
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,280
Those savings

96
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,280
were later withdrawn by someone.

97
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,640
Preliminary speculation is

98
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,000
the person who took the money

99
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
is the suspect.

100
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,480
Neither victim abused drugs,

101
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,280
nor drank excessively,

102
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,160
nor used narcotics.

103
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,520
But due to their work,

104
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,040
their lives were very high-risk.

105
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:28,520
Lu,

106
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,760
I think the killer's methods

107
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,400
are very typical.

108
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,040
Based on our previous interviews

109
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,000
and the case files,

110
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,360
I made a profile of the killer.

111
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,120
The motive is murder for money.

112
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,800
The methods are extremely brutal.

113
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,760
He may be psychologically disturbed

114
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,560
or

115
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,760
show signs of sadism.

116
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,240
But he

117
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,040
never deliberately

118
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,520
tries to hide his murders.

119
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,640
Also,

120
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,640
his criminal skills

121
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,680
aren't actually advanced.

122
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,520
Both cases weren't random acts.

123
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,280
He prepares before committing crimes.

124
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,360
And

125
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,640
the criminal shows

126
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,800
extreme narcissism and arrogance.

127
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:58,640
So, Lu Ming,

128
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,760
I suspect

129
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,400
the killer is very likely to strike again.

130
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:03,760
Xiao Yu,

131
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,760
run this case through the system.

132
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,400
Then upload Jin Weihua's photo

133
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,000
into the system.

134
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,400
Check it.

135
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:08,920
Okay.

136
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:09,520
No problem.

137
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,360
Help!

138
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,880
Help me!

139
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,320
Lu Ming

140
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,800
I'm heading to the tech center.

141
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,360
Hey.

142
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,520
Captain Ji hasn't been around lately.

143
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:38,800
Sigh.

144
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:39,960
It's been over a month.

145
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,960
No new leads at all.

146
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,360
Captain Ji's spirit...

147
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,720
is probably half gone by now.

148
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,440
Seriously.

149
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,080
We got a report.

150
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,440
Someone jumped from a rental in Qian County

151
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,960
off the balcony.

152
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,240
She screamed someone was trying to kill her.

153
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,920
Qian County.

154
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,080
It's not far from here.

155
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,080
Just a two-hour drive.

156
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,280
But how does this relate to
the Jincheng Dismemberment Case?

157
00:05:59,280 --> 00:05:59,960
What's the connection?

158
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,800
According to the report,

159
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,960
the victim works at a foot massage parlor.

160
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,960
Fits the killer's target profile.

161
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,520
There's a chance

162
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,640
the killer is about to strike again.

163
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,560
Let's gather up.

164
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,360
We leave at two sharp.

165
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,200
Don't miss a single clue.

166
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,600
What exactly happened then?

167
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,720
At that time,

168
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,280
I was about to go to bed.

169
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,760
I heard someone knocking.

170
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:27,560
I...

171
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:31,640
It's okay.

172
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,640
Just tell us, don't worry.

173
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,960
I thought it was a regular client.

174
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,680
I wanted to earn a bit more.

175
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,040
Sometimes

176
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,760
I'd let clients come to my place.

177
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,400
It's cheaper than at the shop.

178
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,040
So I was half-asleep

179
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,400
and went to open the door.

180
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,920
Then I got tied up.

181
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,120
Did you see

182
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,280
what that person looked like?

183
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,560
I couldn't see clearly.

184
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,040
His face was covered.

185
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,760
But I'm sure I've seen him before.

186
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,280
You didn't see him clearly,

187
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,200
so how do you know you've met him?

188
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,320
I saw his tiger head tattoo.

189
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,560
Do you remember where you saw him?

190
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,560
I can't recall.

191
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,120
I do foot massages for clients every day.

192
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,560
Dozens of people.

193
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,040
I just can't remember.

194
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,400
This person—

195
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:20,840
have you seen him?

196
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,760
No.

197
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,040
He has a scar on his face.

198
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,920
With such a clear feature,

199
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,760
if I'd seen him even once,

200
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,120
I'd definitely remember.

201
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:39,880
You and Li Ya

202
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,520
go again

203
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,720
and check out the foot massage parlor.

204
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,200
I'll head to Jin Weihua's hometown.

205
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:44,760
Captain Ji.

206
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:46,840
Hello?

207
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,400
Qilu.

208
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,640
Tell the captain

209
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:49,880
I'm going to Qian County.

210
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,080
Old hands know best.

211
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,040
Captain Ji.

212
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,360
has already gone to Jin Weihua's place.

213
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:57,960
Alright.

214
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:58,520
That's perfect.

215
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,240
Let's go find Captain Ji.

216
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,200
When you two finish up,

217
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:00,560
come over quickly.

218
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,520
Hello.

219
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,520
What service do you need?

220
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:15,560
Police.

221
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,480
I need to see your boss.

222
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,120
Hello.

223
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,960
This way, please.

224
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,320
Oh, officer—

225
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,120
We're running a legit business here.

226
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:25,760
Smoking.

227
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,040
Smoking.

228
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,320
Whether it's legit or not,

229
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:27,960
we know ourselves.

230
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,360
We're not here for that today.

231
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:29,800
Then...

232
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,520
Want a foot massage?

233
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:31,320
No, thanks.

234
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,200
Is Yangyang one of your staff?

235
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:33,640
Yes.

236
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:34,960
Is something wrong?

237
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,480
Did she upset anyone recently?

238
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:37,920
As far as I know,

239
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,760
I don't think so.

240
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,200
Sometimes there's a quarrel.

241
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,120
That's pretty normal.

242
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,760
In our line of work,

243
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,200
some clients

244
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,040
get a bit handsy.

245
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,680
But we're a legit business.

246
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,480
We just talk it out and move on.

247
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,200
Mm-hmm.

248
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,200
About her—

249
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,200
Any strange clients lately?

250
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,080
Yangyang

251
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,400
is good-looking.

252
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,240
And...

253
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,800
her service is great.

254
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,680
So she has lots of regulars.

255
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,360
Do you have surveillance here?

256
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,320
Surveillance?

257
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,360
We don't have any.

258
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,240
If we installed cameras,

259
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,120
clients wouldn't come anymore.

260
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:08,960
This person—

261
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,040
do you know him?

262
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:11,840
Oh—

263
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,680
No, no.

264
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,120
Never seen him.

265
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,480
Never seen him.

266
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,400
Alright.

267
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,120
If you remember anything later,

268
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,040
contact us anytime.

269
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,960
Okay, okay, okay.

270
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,760
Or maybe...

271
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,760
Want a foot massage before you go?

272
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:23,400
No, thanks.

273
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,920
Take care, then.

274
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,240
Officer.

275
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,080
What about the hospital?

276
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,520
Lu Ming, Captain Ji—

277
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,680
We've got food ready.

278
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,400
I've got things to do at the station.

279
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,080
I'll head back first.

280
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:32,480
Alright.

281
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,520
Thanks for your trouble.

282
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,480
No need to see me out.

283
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,120
I'm off now.

284
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,560
I'll treat you to a meal next time.

285
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,840
Captain Ji, please continue.

286
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,120
Here's the situation.

287
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,880
Jin Weihua's father

288
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,960
is in the late stage of cancer.

289
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,440
He doesn't have much time left.

290
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,880
It's Jin Weihua's younger brother,

291
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:50,880
Jin Dayu,

292
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,560
who's staying at home.

293
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,880
According to Jin Dayu,

294
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,800
it's just him and his father at home.

295
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,000
Jin Yu hasn't seen Jin Weihua in ages.

296
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,960
The lead just went cold.

297
00:09:59,640 --> 00:09:59,800
No.

298
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,880
Jin Weihua has been back.

299
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,960
This Jin Dayu

300
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,320
wasn't telling the truth.

301
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:05,800
Captain Ji,

302
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,000
how did you figure that out?

303
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,240
Just look at your father's condition.

304
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,880
What did your doctors say?

305
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,760
The doctor said

306
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,880
the situation isn't good.

307
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,440
If treatment continues,

308
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,320
it'll cost a lot of money.

309
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,120
I asked Jin Dayu,

310
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,560
I said,

311
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,760
does anyone ever visit

312
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,000
your house?

313
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,200
He told me

314
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,360
never.

315
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,080
But his father

316
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,560
has been bedridden for years.

317
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,440
All these years,

318
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,120
the wine glass on the table

319
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,880
can't possibly be his, right?

320
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,240
The only person Jin Dayu would hide

321
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,440
is just one person.

322
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,360
That's Jin Weihua.

323
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,120
Exactly.

324
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,440
If I'm not mistaken,

325
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,440
Jin Weihua

326
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,880
hasn't gone far.

327
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,320
He'll come back again.

328
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,240
But

329
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,560
Yangyang said

330
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,880
he's never seen Jin Weihua.

331
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,440
With all my years

332
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,000
as a detective,

333
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,000
although

334
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,560
I don't know if the one who attacked Yangyang

335
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,640
was Jin Weihua,

336
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,640
but I'm sure

337
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,200
the Jincheng Dismemberment Case

338
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,320
was definitely done by Jin Weihua.

339
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,440
If he's hiding nearby,

340
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,320
he'll strike again for sure.

341
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,880
Have Xiaoyu check the local cameras.

342
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,120
See if there's any sign of Jin Weihua.

343
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:23,880
Hey.

344
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,080
Pretty, right?

345
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,760
Too bad she works at the club,

346
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,000
always with the big bosses.
