1
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,600
Wang Ping

2
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,280
You're his identical twin, right?

3
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,160
Yes.

4
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,640
The Luo Xiaomei case.

5
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,160
You haven't told me the truth, have you?

6
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:33,720
Sir,

7
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,080
Every word I said is true.

8
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:35,640
Really.

9
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,080
I even tried to talk my brother out of it.

10
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,520
But I couldn't stop him at all.

11
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,760
Don't be nervous.

12
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,840
So, you're saying

13
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,960
at that time, you were

14
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,720
hearing it yourself,

15
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,080
seeing it with your own eyes,

16
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,080
your brother Wang Ping

17
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,400
raped her,

18
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:49,960
then

19
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:50,760
killed her to silence her.

20
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,640
Did the girl beg for mercy?

21
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,400
She did.

22
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,400
Tell me about Luo Xiaomei.

23
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,640
What did she look like?

24
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:02,840
Well,

25
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,080
she was just

26
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,520
an ordinary girl, nothing special.

27
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,720
Long hair or short hair?

28
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:07,520
Fat?

29
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,040
Tall?

30
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:08,600
Short?

31
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,080
Thin?

32
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,080
Was she delicate and pretty?

33
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,160
Or rosy lips and white teeth?

34
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,080
Which part

35
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,520
made you lose control like an animal?

36
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,200
Sir,

37
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,600
I didn't do it.

38
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,760
My brother did it.

39
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,040
Wang Ping did it.

40
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:18,880
Now,

41
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,000
Wang Ping is dead too.

42
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,720
No one left to testify.

43
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,760
Do you feel relieved now?

44
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,720
This rape and murder case

45
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,520
has nothing to do with you anymore?

46
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,720
No.

47
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,760
My brother really did it.

48
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,120
Sir,

49
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,520
That's what you said.

50
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,520
If I find out

51
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,880
you got away with a crime back then,

52
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,760
or

53
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,280
if you are actually Wang Ping,

54
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,000
you're finished.

55
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,160
Sir,

56
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,400
Home invasion and robbery.

57
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,880
Ex-convict.

58
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,160
I am Wang Feng.

59
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,880
Why do I just not believe

60
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,760
you're Wang Feng?

61
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,760
Believe it or not, that's up to you.

62
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,520
Relax.

63
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,520
Just joking.

64
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,400
Tell me about you and your brother.

65
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,640
My brother wanted to kill me.

66
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,400
That's interesting.

67
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,520
Go on.

68
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,880
The day I got out of prison,

69
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,680
my brother contacted me.

70
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,760
It's a painful memory.

71
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,160
But to my brother,

72
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,880
it was like heaven.

73
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,600
He told me himself,

74
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,840
if the crime back then wasn't a capital offense,

75
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,120
he would have gone straight to

76
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,720
the nearest police station to turn himself in.

77
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,480
These eighteen years,

78
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,720
he lived like a dog.

79
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,840
A stray dog, at that.

80
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,960
Always hiding.

81
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,240
Living in fear.

82
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:49,720
Money—

83
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:50,720
yes,

84
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,720
he made some.

85
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,240
Life wasn't bad.

86
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,840
But a person

87
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,080
can't escape

88
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,720
that anxious heart.

89
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:02,520
That—

90
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,480
Luo Yi.

91
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,720
I know.

92
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,240
He's the father of that little girl.

93
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,200
He's been looking for my brother all these years.

94
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,360
He wants my brother dead.

95
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,120
I know.

96
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,720
I took him there.

97
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,120
So I, I—

98
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,520
At worst,

99
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,640
I'm just an accomplice, right?

100
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,440
I'll go back to prison.

101
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,600
Do another ten-plus years.

102
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,640
That's still better than

103
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,960
being killed by my brother.

104
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,800
You really

105
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,320
understand how it feels.

106
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,280
Mm.

107
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:28,960
What is this?

108
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,560
I did steal, that's true.

109
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,200
But Wang Ping's stuff

110
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,560
was all illegal gains too.

111
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,560
It'll be handed over sooner or later.

112
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:38,800
Right?

113
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,960
You can open Wang Ping's safe?

114
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,080
That's right.

115
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:42,800
Back then,

116
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,640
at that time,

117
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,440
you saw your brother open the safe.

118
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,400
And you memorized the code.

119
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:46,920
Yes, yes.

120
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:47,920
That's how it was.

121
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,560
Captain Lu.

122
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,080
Wait.

123
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,000
This chemical test report shows

124
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,320
Wang Feng, back then,

125
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,680
also took part in the rape and murder.

126
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,760
And it's still within the statute of limitations.

127
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,680
So now tell me,

128
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,040
are you Wang Feng

129
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,640
or Wang Ping?

130
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,440
I really didn't expect this.

131
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,160
If that's really the case,

132
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,760
people's hearts

133
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,960
can be so dark.

134
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,000
At first,

135
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,080
I thought Wang Feng

136
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,000
wanted to use Luo Yi

137
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,000
to lure out Wang Ping

138
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,120
and kill him for money.

139
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,440
But I didn't expect

140
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,560
Wang Ping was the cruelest one.

141
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:13,960
He killed two birds with one stone,

142
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,760
and played it perfectly.

143
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,680
He got rid of his enemy

144
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,560
and swapped identities

145
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,360
with Wang Feng.

146
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,080
It's a pity about old Luo.

147
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,880
He was such a good man.

148
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,640
Why did he do something

149
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,080
so foolish and ruin himself?

150
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,840
In this world,

151
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,120
some things

152
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,560
must be handled personally.

153
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:50,840
Xiaole,

154
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,840
Xiaole,

155
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,560
Xiaole,

156
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,920
I've been kidnapped by Sun Wukong.

157
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,120
He forced me to kill a woman.

158
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,840
It's so dark inside.

159
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,320
We're almost at Fifth Avenue.

160
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:20,920
Meet up with us.

161
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,520
There's a case.

162
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,200
Okay.

163
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,360
I've brought the money for you.

164
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,760
Where's my son?

165
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,440
Kick the box over.

166
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,680
Hurry up.

167
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,480
Hurry up.

168
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,040
You rich people

169
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,760
are really stingy.

170
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,760
Even the ransom for your son

171
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,800
has to be bargained.

172
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,160
Dad.

173
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:02,920
Useless.

174
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,320
You've got the money.

175
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,760
I'm taking my son with me.

176
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:12,760
Stop.

177
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:13,800
Don't shoot.

178
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,440
Don't shoot.

179
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:14,920
Don't shoot.

180
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,080
A box this size

181
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,080
should be for the ransom, right?

182
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,640
It's so big,

183
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,200
it could hold a million or so.

184
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,920
That shouldn't be a problem.

185
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,080
Why bother with all this?

186
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,920
Just take it and go.

187
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,080
I've been kidnapped by Sun Wukong.

188
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,640
Why are you standing there?

189
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,400
What are you doing?

190
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,480
The guy on the stretcher is Qian Junjie.

191
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,960
He was my classmate as a kid.

192
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,640
Then by the rules,

193
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,320
you should recuse yourself.

194
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:05,640
Captain Lu.

195
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,760
I suspect this case

196
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,600
is linked to a suicide from last year.

197
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,640
Coffee on the Left Bank of the Seine,

198
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,520
a cup in your hand,

199
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,080
tasting your beauty,

200
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,360
your smile flying in the sky.

201
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,200
Your phone.

202
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,080
Thank you.

203
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,080
Hello, Xiaole.

204
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,240
Minmin.

205
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,560
I had a dream.

206
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,320
I dreamed

207
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,200
I was kidnapped by Sun Wukong.

208
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,920
He took me to a warehouse.

209
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,080
There was a big hole in the ceiling.

210
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,080
Sun Wukong.

211
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,560
He pointed a gun at my head.

212
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,560
Forced me to kill.

213
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,680
I had no choice, I really had no choice.

214
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,600
I killed a woman.

215
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,680
I can't hear you clearly.

216
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,320
Xiaole.

217
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,760
What did you say?

218
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:48,680
Gang (just now).

219
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:49,560
Gang (just now).

220
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,320
He and I hid the body together.

221
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,120
Who is he?

222
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,160
I can't say.

223
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,040
I can't say.

224
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,320
Zhu Bajie will kill him.

225
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,120
I can't say.

226
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,800
I just had a nightmare.

227
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:00,720
Minmin.

228
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,200
Don't take it to heart.

229
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,680
I'm hanging up now.

230
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,800
Xiaole.

231
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,360
Xiao.

232
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,320
Minmin, it's your turn for the second part.

233
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:08,680
Come quickly.

234
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,320
His last call was to me.

235
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,800
But I missed it.

236
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,880
That night,

237
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,480
he killed himself.

238
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:29,880
If I had

239
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,080
called him back then,

240
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,120
maybe he'd still be alive.

241
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,440
Later, we mourned Xiaole together.

242
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,080
That's when I learned

243
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,240
so much happened in his family.

244
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,120
Minmin,

245
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,000
the dead can't come back.

246
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,000
You mustn't fall too.

247
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Why did Xiaole suddenly kill himself?

248
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,920
Was it his father's death

249
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,480
that hit him too hard?

250
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,760
It seems something happened in Xiaole's family.

251
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,560
He seemed short on money.

252
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,440
He asked to borrow money from me a few days ago.

253
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,360
He looked like he'd lost a lot of weight.

254
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,800
I asked what he needed the money for.

255
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,680
He wouldn't say.

256
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,320
He asked me for money too.

257
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,560
He even said

258
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,880
he wanted to sell his house.

259
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,880
He asked me to help find a buyer.

260
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,240
I don't know why he was in such a rush

261
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,440
to get so much money.

262
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,880
Did he end up selling the house?

263
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,240
I don't think so.

264
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,000
He hadn't transferred the ownership yet.

265
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,760
Then this happened.

266
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,480
Don't be too sad.

267
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,480
So what you're saying is

268
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,360
what Sheng Xiaole mentioned before
on the phone

269
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,480
Sun Wukong and Zhu Bajie

270
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,680
match the disguises
of these two kidnappers

271
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,000
So you suspect

272
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,120
the kidnappers who took Qian Junjie

273
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,640
are connected to Sheng Xiaole's
suicide case last year

274
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,240
That's right

275
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:44,800
I've always felt

276
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,200
Sheng Xiaole's death was suspicious

277
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,880
She was about to get the money
from selling her house

278
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:49,800
How could she suddenly...

279
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,800
What did the investigation
say back then?

280
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,560
They said it was suicide

281
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,800
She left a note at the time

282
00:11:59,320 --> 00:11:59,680
I see

283
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,560
Let's split up

284
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:01,600
Have Xiaoyu

285
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,240
pull up the case file
from a year ago

286
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,320
for Sheng Xiaole's case

287
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,000
Qilu

288
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:04,680
you follow up

289
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,360
The two of us will go
to the hospital

290
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,560
Qian Junjie should be waking up soon

291
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,360
As for you

292
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,480
no matter if this case
from last year

293
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,440
is related to you or not

294
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:13,800
according to the rules

295
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,320
you have to recuse yourself

296
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,360
But if there's anything

297
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,560
that needs to be investigated

298
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,120
I'll let you know

299
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:17,880
Then you can come back

300
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:18,800
Yes, Captain Lu

301
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,480
Captain Lu

302
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,920
Qian Junjie should wake up soon

303
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,680
But he just lost a loved one

304
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
His emotions probably won't
be stable

305
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:29,680
Maybe let Minmin

306
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,560
go along to help comfort him

307
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,320
That works

308
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,440
Thank you, Captain Lu
