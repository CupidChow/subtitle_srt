1
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,120
You two

2
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,560
treat other people's lives as toys

3
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,120
But now

4
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,360
there's another life inside you

5
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,120
Tao Weiyi

6
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,280
Tao Weiyi

7
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,040
We already

8
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,560
have evidence against you

9
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,640
For the child's sake

10
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,280
don't be stubborn anymore

11
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,360
What is this

12
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,040
Youthful ignorance

13
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,200
When I studied in Europe

14
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,200
I followed the trend

15
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,200
At first

16
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,640
I truly had nothing left to live for

17
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,040
But unexpectedly

18
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,520
I met you again

19
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:14,920
The two of us

20
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,840
have both surrendered to this world

21
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,680
In the next life

22
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,440
I don't want to be a good person

23
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:23,840
It's too exhausting

24
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,800
No matter what

25
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,680
Tomorrow

26
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,400
let's jump together

27
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:31,640
That way

28
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,040
we'll have company on the way

29
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:35,600
Weiyi

30
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,360
Listen to me

31
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,480
Since we're

32
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,520
not afraid of death

33
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,800
why not play a game

34
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,040
where we control others' lives and deaths

35
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,640
then go die ourselves

36
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,800
A game

37
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,080
What kind of game

38
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,920
Why is it called The Night Owl Game

39
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,520
Night owl means someone active at night

40
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,080
So how did you manage

41
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,880
to make those people, before dying

42
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,520
for a month

43
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,320
become more and more like zombies

44
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,640
It's actually simple

45
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,960
During that month

46
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,080
make them complete

47
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,520
one self-harm task after another

48
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,200
Their spirit is easily broken

49
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,480
Getting a night owl tattoo

50
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,360
is one of the tasks, right

51
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,480
The final day's task is

52
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,200
at four forty-eight in the morning

53
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,200
to commit suicide

54
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,240
Xiao Yu

55
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,640
said his phone is off

56
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,120
No signal

57
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,880
What did traffic control say

58
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,400
They've compiled the info

59
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,080
It's being sent over

60
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,760
Sir, may I ask

61
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,800
where does this road lead

62
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:52,640
This

63
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,000
should be near Donghua Road

64
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,320
Donghua Road

65
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,000
Donghua Road

66
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,440
Let's go

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,360
Split up and search

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,680
Zhang Ming, right

69
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,560
Good evening

70
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,320
Calm down

71
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,520
Tao Weiyi

72
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,360
We've already caught

73
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,240
She's now

74
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,760
luring you to suicide step by step

75
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:53,680
Do you understand

76
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,440
Lesley

77
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,080
No need anymore

78
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,520
Let her go

79
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,920
Letting her go or not

80
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,440
isn't up to you or me

81
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,120
Those games she made you play

82
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,080
are just luring you to suicide

83
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,120
Hurry

84
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,800
Officer

85
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,880
Don't come any closer

86
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:09,800
If you get closer

87
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,800
maybe you won't make it to

88
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,800
four forty-eight

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,360
Okay

90
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,240
I won't move

91
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,040
Sigh

92
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:15,760
But

93
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,640
does it even matter

94
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,680
Whether this game exists

95
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,880
does it even matter

96
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,800
I read your file

97
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,640
I just don't get

98
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,880
why you want to kill yourself

99
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,440
Officer

100
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,440
I don't know either

101
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,440
why you're helping me

102
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:32,560
No

103
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,320
Man

104
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,200
I don't get it

105
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,520
To find you

106
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,560
I lost two pounds running all night

107
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,760
and you tell me this

108
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,320
It's not you looking for me

109
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,800
What's it got to do with me

110
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,200
I won't say much

111
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:42,960
I won't talk about

112
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,120
doing it for your parents

113
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,120
I'm just curious

114
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,320
what's bothering you

115
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,120
that you have to kill yourself

116
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,240
I don't know

117
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,120
Don't know

118
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,960
If you don't know, why sit there

119
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,200
and insist on

120
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,440
No

121
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,000
I don't know why I'm alive

122
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,440
I don't know if dying

123
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,200
would be better

124
00:05:59,200 --> 00:05:59,880
I'm tired

125
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,200
I'm really tired

126
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,120
Lesley

127
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,560
at least gave me a choice

128
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,520
Just because of that

129
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,000
we go to work and come home every day

130
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
work and home, day after day

131
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,200
It's been like this for years

132
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,120
Did I say anything

133
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,120
Aren't I living fine

134
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,640
You're a cop

135
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,320
You have new cases every day

136
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,560
You have your beliefs

137
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,880
You can't say that

138
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,320
Easy for you to say

139
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,080
We handle so many cases daily

140
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,200
To use your words

141
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,560
How do you know being a cop isn't hard

142
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,520
Don't come over

143
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,640
If you come any closer

144
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,520
I'll jump

145
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,240
Step back

146
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,800
But to get back to what we were saying,

147
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,440
Our captain

148
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,760
when he was working on your case,

149
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,440
he said,

150
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,560
young people nowadays,

151
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,880
life is pretty good,

152
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,360
so why do they always think about suicide?

153
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,760
How does that song go again?

154
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,000
Please turn on the TV and see

155
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,320
how many people fight to keep living.

156
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,120
I can't sing well,

157
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,200
just giving an example.

158
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,000
Back then, there was an elder in our team.

159
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,200
He said,

160
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:00,880
He said,

161
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,680
every generation has its own struggles.

162
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,520
Our grandparents,

163
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,760
were either at war

164
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,800
or just coming out of war.

165
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,320
Having food to eat

166
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,520
and being alive

167
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,560
was happiness.

168
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,680
Our parents,

169
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,680
getting some meat during holidays

170
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,360
or a piece of candy

171
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,440
was happiness.

172
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,640
Now, for our generation,

173
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,440
food and drink

174
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,200
even with low pay, we don't go hungry.

175
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,680
So why is it now

176
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,200
that we can't find motivation?

177
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,760
Yeah.

178
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:36,680
Zhang Ming,

179
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,440
what do you want?

180
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,120
I don't know.

181
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,080
Let me ask you again,

182
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,560
what do you really want?

183
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,880
I truly don't know.

184
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,520
If you ask me,

185
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,120
I want to solve cases,

186
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,720
solve the kind of case

187
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,160
no one else in the world can crack.

188
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,040
I want to travel,

189
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,320
I want to see what this world

190
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,320
is really like.

191
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,040
I want to marry a beautiful wife,

192
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,600
have a bunch of chubby kids,

193
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,080
so that the single guys around me

194
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:22,840
the bachelors

195
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,560
are jealous every day.

196
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,200
I want my parents

197
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,440
to enjoy family happiness.

198
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,200
But right now,

199
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,360
I'm just

200
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,960
someone getting by.

201
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,960
I'm just an ordinary cop.

202
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,600
Half my life gone, still a cop.

203
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,720
But today,

204
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,720
I can save you here, Zhang Ming.

205
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,960
I can give it my all.

206
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:43,800
You—

207
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,960
do you understand?

208
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,080
When this child is born,

209
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:11,720
he'll probably have

210
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,960
a high risk of depression.

211
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,720
Tao Weiyi and I are both like this.

212
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,440
I really feel sorry for her.

213
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,560
I never thought

214
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,000
we led so many people

215
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,840
out of this world,

216
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,120
and in the end,

217
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,120
I brought someone new.

218
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,000
When he grows up,

219
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,560
he'll understand

220
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,600
that coming to this world

221
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,200
is just to suffer.

222
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,560
The child won't be like you.

223
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,240
He'll definitely see

224
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,600
the good side of the world.

225
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,600
That's why Tao Weiyi

226
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,000
chose to keep the child.

227
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,640
Go ahead, tell us.

228
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,080
That day,

229
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,480
when Zhou Jinwen jumped,

230
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,360
why were you there?

231
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,560
You still owe the world an explanation.

232
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,560
Alright.

233
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:18,800
I'll talk.

234
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,600
The child is very healthy.

235
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,840
See what the world is really like.

236
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,480
I want to marry a beautiful wife,

237
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,600
have a bunch of chubby kids.

238
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,360
I want my parents

239
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,600
to enjoy family happiness.

240
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,360
But right now,

241
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,560
I'm just

242
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,120
someone getting by.

243
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,960
I'm just an ordinary cop.

244
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,720
Half my life gone, still a cop.

245
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,840
But today,

246
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,840
I can save you here, Zhang Ming.

247
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,120
I can give it my all.

248
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:30,840
You—

249
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,080
do you understand?

250
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,120
So cool.

251
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,600
Keep it low-key.

252
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,320
Yeah,

253
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,840
just showing some real feelings.

254
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:39,880
Yeah,

255
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,120
it was a bit contagious.

256
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,720
Actually,

257
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,560
I wanted to praise you more.

258
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,760
But seeing you act like this now,

259
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:48,840
suddenly

260
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,480
I don't want to praise you anymore.

261
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,640
Do you know what it means

262
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,760
to have a certain kind of leader,

263
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,120
you get that kind of team member.

264
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,120
I'm just being genuine.

265
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,480
This—

266
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,960
Who acts like this out there?

267
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,080
This—

268
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,320
Really—

269
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,120
real feelings.

270
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,600
Honestly, I think you're a hero.

271
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,400
Cool.
