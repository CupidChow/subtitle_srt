1
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:24,840
Hey.

2
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,080
Searching for him a thousand times in the crowd,

3
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,160
Suddenly turning around,

4
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,840
He is right here.

5
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:30,920
Check.

6
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:31,840
Okay.

7
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,400
Feeling energized.

8
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:37,480
Captain Lu.

9
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,080
We found the person who stole Zhu Jin's wallet.

10
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,480
It's a habitual thief named Wang Qingchun.

11
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,160
I've already asked Xiaoyu to send the info.

12
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,840
We're also investigating here.

13
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,520
Someone has

14
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,080
Wang Qingchun's entire theft process

15
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,600
all recorded.

16
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,360
Posted it on Weibo.

17
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,800
Now they've even followed

18
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,400
Wang Qingchun all the way home.

19
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,360
That's great.

20
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,720
Send me Wang Qingchun's home address.

21
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:52,720
Mm-hmm.

22
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:53,840
Alright.

23
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,760
Well...

24
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,040
If you get there first, just keep watch.

25
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:56,720
Be careful.

26
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,320
Don't worry.

27
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,240
Once we're inside,

28
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,480
you knock out Zhang Tao from behind.

29
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,040
I'll go restrain Wang Qingchun.

30
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,400
After we kill them,

31
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,760
just toss them into the river.

32
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,000
Tell everyone

33
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,640
they both went back to their hometown.

34
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,520
If we wait until tomorrow morning,

35
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,320
and he turns himself in,

36
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,720
we're both screwed.

37
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,400
I don't care about my own life.

38
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,520
But your mom

39
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,400
still counts on you, her son,

40
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:26,960
to take care of her.

41
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,440
Let's go.

42
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,200
Looks like they've got two new partners.

43
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,160
Wait a second.

44
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,640
Let me see if I can get something juicy.

45
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,320
You are...

46
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,200
Hello.

47
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,480
Excuse me, have you seen this person?

48
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:32,960
Hurry up.

49
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:37,960
She's inside.

50
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,480
Come in.

51
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,040
Maybe let the lady come out instead.

52
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,960
Just a few words.

53
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,200
Or maybe wait inside.

54
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:46,920
She's in the bathroom.

55
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,360
It's fine.

56
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,360
I'll just wait here for her.

57
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,320
Don't move.

58
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:05,840
Zhang Tao.

59
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,400
Are you okay, Zhang Tao?

60
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,440
Zhang Tao, are you alright?

61
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,920
Is Zhang Tao okay?

62
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,280
He's fine.

63
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:13,800
We'll leave first.

64
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,400
No rush.

65
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,320
No rush.

66
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,320
He's alright.

67
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:16,760
We'll leave first.

68
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,040
Officer.

69
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,200
Thank you.

70
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,400
You saved my life.

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,600
Thank me?

72
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,640
We should be thanking you.

73
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,480
Your photos were a huge help.

74
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,040
And...

75
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,120
So that means

76
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,280
you solved the case using my photos?

77
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,120
Glad I could help.

78
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,080
That's really great.

79
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,600
The one you secretly photographed,

80
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,000
the girl whose wallet was stolen,

81
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,120
is dead.

82
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,120
Dead.

83
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:55,840
Just...

84
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,400
the girl I photographed.

85
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,640
She was raped and then killed.

86
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,000
If...

87
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,640
If only I had called the police back then...

88
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:15,600
Wrap it up.

89
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,160
Finished eating.

90
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,000
Pay the bill.

91
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:21,880
Come on, come on.

92
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,120
Here I am.

93
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,280
Two hundred sixty-eight.

94
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:24,760
Who's paying the bill?

95
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,360
Give it to me.

96
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:25,760
I'll do it.

97
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:26,600
I'll pay.

98
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,360
No need.

99
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,880
No, let me.

100
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,000
Captain Lu, it's always you.

101
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,640
Look at you all.

102
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,000
You're all grown-ups.

103
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,600
Why fight over two hundred yuan?

104
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,640
What do you mean?

105
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,360
You looking down on us?

106
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,360
No, just hurry, someone pay.

107
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,000
Hurry up and pay.

108
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,360
Sis still has a bit of cash.

109
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,080
It's fine.

110
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:40,960
Looking down on me.

111
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,120
No, you all...

112
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,760
What are you doing?

113
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,640
Let's hang out together.

114
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,640
I don't know you.

115
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,280
Let go.

116
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,360
Release me.

117
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,760
Don't bully the girl.

118
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,640
I'm not bullying her.

119
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,720
I'm bullying you.

120
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,640
Don't touch me.

121
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,240
Don't touch me!

122
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,240
Let go.

123
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,360
Let go.

124
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,240
Police.

125
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,240
Sit down.

126
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,000
Sit down.

127
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,120
Call the police.

128
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,760
Hello, is this 110?

129
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,160
Someone's causing trouble.

130
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,840
Everyone, stand straight.

131
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,120
That's great.

132
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:13,720
Really.

133
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,240
Acting bravely.

134
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:14,880
Really, really good.

135
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,120
Very good.

136
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,400
So nice.

137
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:15,880
No.

138
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:16,480
Well...

139
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,240
My attitude just now...

140
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,240
I was a bit harsh to you.

141
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,000
It's fine, really.

142
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,640
Sorry.

143
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,120
You're from the northeast?

144
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,360
Yes, from the northeast.

145
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,360
We'll eat at your place next time.

146
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,240
Sure, just come.

147
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,160
Right.

148
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,000
One more thing.

149
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,240
Who's paying this bill?

150
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,240
Two hundred sixty-eight.

151
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:30,880
Well...

152
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,720
Can we get a group deal?

153
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,240
Make it two hundred sixty.

154
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,000
Two hundred sixty.

155
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,200
I'll scan.

156
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:38,520
Where do I scan?

157
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,160
Here.

158
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:57,960
Ah.

159
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:00,640
What's going on?

160
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,040
The body is badly decomposed.

161
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,040
Not much useful info.

162
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,120
Samples have been sent for testing.

163
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,480
Where are Li Ya and Chen Minmin?

164
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,360
They're here.

165
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:11,640
Sorry.

166
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:11,920
Captain Lu.

167
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,000
There was traffic.

168
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,840
Fill them in on the situation.

169
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:15,920
Got it.

170
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:19,560
The body.

171
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,920
Found by a sanitation worker.

172
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,920
Most body parts have been found.

173
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:23,640
After testing,

174
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,360
it's a female.

175
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,280
Oh my god.

176
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,680
Another dismemberment case.

177
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,280
Can we estimate time of death?

178
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,040
Based on decomposition,

179
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,840
death was about three days ago.

180
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:32,640
For details,

181
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,640
wait for the autopsy report.

182
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,000
I'll head over first.

183
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,680
More body parts found over there.

184
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,200
From the right hand.

185
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,560
Wait for fingerprint analysis.

186
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,440
Any surveillance nearby?

187
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:56,680
This is a

188
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,040
old river to be renovated next year.

189
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,280
It's remote.

190
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:00,680
No surveillance.

191
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:01,440
Alright.

192
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,440
Let Xiaoyu check.

193
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,480
See if there's

194
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,000
recently

195
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,040
any missing women cases.

196
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,560
See if any match.

197
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:07,680
Okay.

198
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,040
Xiaoyu.

199
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,160
Crime scene photos.

200
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,480
Back.

201
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:17,440
Alright.

202
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,160
Captain Lu.

203
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,160
We've checked.

204
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,600
Recent missing women cases,

205
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,600
there are ninety-six.

206
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,400
Most of these cases

207
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,320
are mostly

208
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,560
due to running away.

209
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,440
Exported the data.

210
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,120
Wait.

211
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,400
Enlarge this photo.

212
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:35,680
The victim.

213
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,600
Except for the thumb,

214
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,440
the other four fingers

215
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,560
were all bent backwards.

216
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,040
She was abused before death.

217
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,760
At the finger wounds,

218
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,400
no repeated cutting marks.

219
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,680
The killer is likely male.

220
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,680
Oh.

221
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,000
Veteran cop is a veteran cop.

222
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,040
Captain Ji.

223
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,200
You're impressive.

224
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,400
This killer,

225
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,760
I've seen him.

226
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:58,720
That's right.

227
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,080
Thirteen years ago,

228
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,440
back then,

229
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,960
all fingers on this right hand

230
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,800
were bent backwards.

231
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,560
The victim was likely abused before death.

232
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:47,560
Come.

233
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:48,880
Look.

234
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,800
Broken fingers.

235
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,120
They're different,

236
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,280
but broken in the same way.

237
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,800
The cutting method is also the same.

238
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:58,800
At the wound,

239
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,680
there's no

240
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,240
sign of repeated cutting.

241
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,400
And

242
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,480
such a cruel criminal—

243
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,040
all these years,

244
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,240
I've only seen one like this.

245
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,560
Old Ji,

246
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,480
you've kept this case file all along.

247
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,600
Don't tell me

248
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,480
after all these years,

249
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,480
you still want to investigate this case?

250
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,160
This matter—

251
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,840
Back then, we had already identified the suspect:

252
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,480
Jin Weihua.

253
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,840
When we tried to arrest him,

254
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,800
he managed to escape.

255
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,160
This incident

256
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,040
has become a weight on my mind.

257
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,240
Captain Lu,

258
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,720
can we request a consolidated investigation?
