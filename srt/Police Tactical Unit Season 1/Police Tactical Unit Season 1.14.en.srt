1
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,000
The police are here to see you.

2
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,000
We need to speak with Cheng Xue.

3
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:19,560
Hello.

4
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,280
Please, have a seat.

5
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,160
I'll go get her right away.

6
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,440
Cheng Xue.

7
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:25,680
Can you come here for a moment?

8
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,400
Cheng Xue.

9
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,720
Could you tell us a bit

10
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,560
about Zhang Di's situation?

11
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,160
Cheng Xue.

12
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,040
Someone you spent every day with—

13
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,680
It's terrifying when something like this happens.

14
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:39,960
We've seen this many times.

15
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,400
We truly understand how you feel.

16
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,080
But I believe

17
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,920
you can help us figure out

18
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,680
what really happened.

19
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,680
This Cheng Xue

20
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,320
seems off.

21
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,080
I noticed that too.

22
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,080
She's got something on her mind.

23
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,760
She hasn't told us.

24
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,080
She's very sad.

25
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,320
Sadness.

26
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,680
I just asked the others over there.

27
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,000
They said Zhang Di was

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,120
a senior at this company.

29
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,240
And Cheng Xue joined much later.

30
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,120
But—

31
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,120
Someone mentioned

32
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,960
they might have had a secret relationship.

33
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,880
And they've broken up and gotten back together.

34
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,680
Ahem.

35
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,800
That's pretty normal.

36
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,520
They see each other every day, after all.

37
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,600
Oh.

38
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,000
No wonder

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,120
Cheng Xue is so emotional.

40
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:36,680
Hey—

41
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,200
Do you think

42
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,760
Zhang Di's death

43
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,240
could be related to her?

44
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,760
Love turning into hate?

45
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,160
Doesn't seem like it.

46
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,440
I only sense sadness.

47
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,960
No sign of hatred.

48
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:51,960
So,

49
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,520
how do we proceed with this case?

50
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,360
What's our next step?

51
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,760
Zhang Di's work contacts

52
00:02:59,240 --> 00:02:59,760
and the loan sharks—

53
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,200
those are our two leads.

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,200
Most cases we handle

55
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,680
are usually

56
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,520
feelings aside,

57
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,200
profit comes first.

58
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,040
Hey—

59
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,000
Let me buy you a milk tea.

60
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,680
Osmanthus milk cap flavor.

61
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:19,880
No problem.

62
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:22,680
That's right.

63
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,760
It's from our company.

64
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,000
Here's a copy of Zhang Di's IOU.

65
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,000
And this is

66
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,440
Zhang Di's ID reference file.

67
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,320
He suddenly needed a large sum of money.

68
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,240
Did he ever mention why he borrowed it?

69
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,000
Officer,

70
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,880
for companies like ours,

71
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,000
private lending firms,

72
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,000
few people tell us the truth.

73
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,120
Besides,

74
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,560
why should we care about that?

75
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,240
As long as he pays on time,

76
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,120
that's all that matters.

77
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,080
If he can't pay,

78
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,240
what do you do?

79
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,000
We collect the debt.

80
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,120
No, officer,

81
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,680
don't get the wrong idea.

82
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,080
We want

83
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,960
our borrowers to be safe.

84
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:56,880
After all,

85
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,960
Zhang Di is dead.

86
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,440
We can't get our money back.

87
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,640
It's a huge loss for us too.

88
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,360
Xiao Yu sent me

89
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,960
Zhang Di's recent livestream replay.

90
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,200
The last thing he told his fans

91
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,440
was that he had a big scoop coming soon.

92
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,320
What scoop?

93
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,000
Well,

94
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,200
the thing found most in his home

95
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,320
was this soup seasoning packet.

96
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,680
And there were an absurd amount.

97
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,560
The key is, there was only seasoning,

98
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:24,880
no fans.

99
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,760
Cheng Xue mentioned it earlier too.

100
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,440
Zhang Di was recently

101
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,640
conducting a secret investigation.

102
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Even she didn't know about it.

103
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,080
Could it be about this?

104
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,560
What brand is it?

105
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:33,880
Nonstop Flavor.

106
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,760
Xiao Yu sent me the company info.

107
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,440
Company name:

108
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,680
Xiang Dao Jia Group.

109
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,440
Here in Rongcheng,

110
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,240
it's a top company with billions in annual revenue.

111
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:46,760
It's their product.

112
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,440
Good thing I eat proper meals.

113
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,480
Ha.

114
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,880
Thanks to the department,

115
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,360
we have food twenty-four hours a day.

116
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,560
Alright.

117
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,440
When the case is over,

118
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,440
I'll treat you to a nice meal.

119
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,960
I'll show you the world a bit.

120
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:58,560
Deal.

121
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,520
Speaking of seeing the world—

122
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,200
Judging by Zhang Di's daily spending,

123
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,800
his standard of living wasn't high.

124
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,440
So why did he borrow so much?

125
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,120
Take the seasoning packet for testing first.

126
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,760
I'll check with Xiao Yu again.

127
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,760
Zhang Di's laptop—

128
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,560
see if there's anything on it.

129
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,320
Maybe we'll find where the money went.

130
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,200
Okay.

131
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,480
Let's go.

132
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,080
You can't enter here.

133
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,520
Get out.

134
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:26,680
What are you doing?

135
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,120
Go.

136
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,880
You can't enter—move along.

137
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,320
No entry here.

138
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,440
What is this place?

139
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,560
Get out.

140
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,200
No entry.

141
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,760
I'll say it again—

142
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,560
Move along.

143
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,200
No entry.

144
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:33,920
Go.

145
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,320
Come.

146
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,680
Let me walk you through it.

147
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,640
Here's what I'm thinking right now.

148
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,880
The lab report on the soup packets

149
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,440
and Zhang Di's undercover video

150
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,560
can confirm

151
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,720
Nonstop Flavor

152
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,840
really does contain

153
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,200
illegal flavor enhancers.

154
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,680
And if this gets exposed,

155
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,920
Xiang Dao Jia Group's value will crash.

156
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,400
So is it possible

157
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,080
they found out Zhang Di's real identity

158
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,320
and the undercover video,

159
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,200
and silenced him?

160
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,840
I did look into it.

161
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,160
Zhang Di's reputation online—

162
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:33,960
He,

163
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,320
he really exposed

164
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,280
several major food safety scandals.

165
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,200
No wonder he has so many fans.

166
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,320
He really did

167
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,480
face retaliation before.

168
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,600
There are videos as proof.

169
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,800
That's why people call him the Food Avenger.

170
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:45,920
His reputation

171
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,680
is really solid.

172
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,440
But the thing is,

173
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,920
why was it an execution-style killing?

174
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,080
Right.

175
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,720
Silencing him

176
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,560
didn't have to be so brutal.

177
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,920
Unless—

178
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,280
Sleep.

179
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:05,800
Sleep.

180
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:07,840
Unless what?

181
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,840
It's a warning to someone else.

182
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,560
The undercover evidence

183
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,680
has copies.

184
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:02,640
Cheng Xue,

185
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,800
your secret relationship with Zhang Di—

186
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,720
we already know about it.

187
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,520
So, based on the police's assessment,

188
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,080
for your own safety,

189
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,920
I hope you'll tell me everything.

190
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,680
There's a very important question now.

191
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,000
Before Zhang Di died,

192
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,160
did he ever give you

193
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,240
any crucial evidence?

194
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,160
No.

195
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,160
We can absolutely guarantee your safety.

196
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,840
You don't need to worry about that.

197
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,120
I don't think you want

198
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,160
Zhang Di to die for nothing.

199
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:25,960
Officer Li,

200
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,040
I understand everything you're saying.

201
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,480
But Zhang Di really didn't

202
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,520
give me any documents or anything.

203
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,400
I really was in a relationship with Zhang Di.

204
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,280
But for this investigation,

205
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,880
he didn't tell me anything.

206
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,520
So, as far as you know,

207
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,520
did Zhang Di have any

208
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,280
trusted relatives or friends?

209
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,120
No.

210
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,520
The person closest to him

211
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,520
was probably me.

212
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,120
Still not talking.

213
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,560
I think she's pretty open.

214
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,920
Doesn't seem like she's hiding anything.

215
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,080
We can't touch Xiang Dao Jia Group for now.

216
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,280
The Cheng Xue lead

217
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:09,720
is a dead end too.

218
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,920
What do we do next?

219
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,640
Let's go over

220
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,800
the surveillance from Zhang Di's building

221
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,520
one more time.

222
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,560
His car is still missing.

223
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,080
Let Xiao Yu look into that lead.

224
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:27,840
Qi,

225
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,640
Are you busy?

226
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,800
I have something to report.

227
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,200
Shan Zi.

228
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:31,840
Go ahead.

229
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,200
Qi,

230
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,200
do you know lately

231
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,520
they've been covering Zhang Di's case?

232
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,080
Do you know the officer in charge?

233
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,000
Go on.

234
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:38,640
What's up?

235
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,440
I have a friend—

236
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,560
Xiao Jin, you remember him?

237
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,440
He said

238
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,720
he's got some info on the case.

239
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,280
So,

240
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,280
could you help me get in touch?

241
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,200
Just say it.

242
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,080
I'm in charge of this case.

243
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,280
Qi,

244
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:48,800
This is—

245
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,520
This is Officer Li.

246
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,440
The one handling Zhang Di's case.

247
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:52,920
Hello, Officer Li.

248
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,080
You're on this case,

249
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,080
so it's in good hands.

250
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:55,560
You—

251
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:57,720
Cut the crap.

252
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,160
Got it, Qi.

253
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,160
Xiao Jin says Zhang Di's car

254
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,720
is with him.

255
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,520
What?

256
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,280
As soon as he

257
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,440
heard about Zhang Di's trouble,

258
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,000
he freaked out.

259
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,920
He came to me right away.

260
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,200
Where's the car now?

261
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:10,640
Don't rush.

262
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,400
Qi,

263
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,480
there's something

264
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,680
I need to discuss with you first.

265
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,920
You know how I am.

266
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,400
I get it.

267
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:16,680
Qi,

268
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,360
So,

269
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,480
Xiao Jin, that guy,

270
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,360
he likes to

271
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,360
set up card games and stuff.

272
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,360
He wants to fully cooperate.

273
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:22,880
Is it possible—

274
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,760
Let me tell you,

275
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,960
this car is tied to a murder.

276
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,760
You decide for yourself.

277
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,040
Shan Zi, right?

278
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:27,760
Tell Xiao Jin

279
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,200
I'm in a hurry.

280
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,520
I'm going to see the car now.

281
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,400
Tell him not to panic.

282
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,880
Gambling, no matter what,

283
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,120
is lighter than murder.

284
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:34,800
Sis Li,

285
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,640
I know, I know.

286
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,960
I'll have him call Qi right away.

287
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,040
How did this get tied to gambling again?

288
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,240
You guys keep investigating.

289
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,480
I'm going to step out for a bit.

290
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,800
Xiao Jin's boss—

291
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,800
The gambling den was busted.

292
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,320
According to his boss's statement,

293
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,440
that car belonging to Zhang Di

294
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,680
was supposedly used to pay off a debt.

295
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,240
But in reality, he was tasked

296
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,240
with delivering it to Zhang Di.

297
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,520
Forensics found in the car's trunk

298
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,760
fibers from the material wrapping Zhang Di's body.

299
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,240
So, this car—

300
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,440
who delivered it to the gambling boss?

301
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,520
You'll never guess.

302
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,520
Just tell me!

303
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,880
The head of Xiang Dao Jia Group—

304
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:44,640
Xue Ming.

305
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,240
So brazen...

306
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,360
Anyway,

307
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,760
he's the prime suspect now.

308
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,920
He has a motive for murder, too.

309
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:50,880
The chain of evidence

310
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:51,880
is basically complete.

311
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,000
Since that's the case,

312
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,360
let's detain him and question him thoroughly.

313
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:56,680
There's something else.

314
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,120
Cheng Xue has a daughter.
