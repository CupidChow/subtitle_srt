1
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:15,880
Darn it.

2
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,800
I'm begging you.

3
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,400
Please, just listen to me.

4
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:17,720
No.

5
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:18,920
You can't.

6
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,680
You can't go.

7
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:22,560
Go.

8
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:24,920
Lao Ji.

9
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,280
Sorry.

10
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,360
Xiao Yu.

11
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,160
Hello, Captain Lu.

12
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,920
It could be Luo Xiaomei's father, Luo Yi.

13
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,280
I just found a car registered to him.

14
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,840
The camera caught it as it left the city.

15
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,600
There's someone inside.

16
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,280
It might be Lao Ji.

17
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,160
Stay on standby at the station.

18
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,520
Once Lao Ji's location is confirmed,

19
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,760
immediately track Luo Yi's whereabouts.

20
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,080
Okay.

21
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,480
Copy that.

22
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:17,520
Lao Ji.

23
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,120
Pull over.

24
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:23,400
Lao Ji.

25
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:25,760
Lao Ji.

26
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:26,840
Hurry.

27
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,080
Go after him, quick.

28
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,840
Go after Luo Yi, now.

29
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,360
I'll call an ambulance.

30
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,200
Lao Ji has heart disease.

31
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:32,960
There's nitroglycerin in the car.

32
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:33,440
Hurry up.

33
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,120
Go after Luo Yi, fast.

34
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,360
Lao Ji.

35
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,200
Take your time, speak slowly.

36
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,400
What happened?

37
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:37,920
All these years,

38
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,200
I've always

39
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,280
kept in touch with Luo Yi.

40
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,200
His daughter's case—

41
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:44,920
A parent

42
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,760
burying their child.

43
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,720
The suspect is still at large.

44
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,160
It's not just in his heart,

45
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,200
it's in mine too.

46
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,840
A thorn I can't let go.

47
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,400
I think he's made up his mind.

48
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,520
He wants to find Wang Ping himself and get revenge.

49
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,160
This Luo Yi

50
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,840
is a good man.

51
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,080
He served in the army when he was young.

52
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,080
Ever since

53
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,840
his daughter's case,

54
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,160
overnight,

55
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,400
just overnight,

56
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:19,960
he

57
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,920
turned gray.

58
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:23,520
Lao Ji.

59
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,400
Lao Ji.

60
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,720
Drink some water.

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,840
I've been a cop for so many years,

62
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,960
and I can't even catch one person.

63
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,080
Maybe every detective

64
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,960
has a thorn in their heart.

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,600
Don't worry.

66
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,480
Lao Ji's been found.

67
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,000
He's fine.

68
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,200
That's such a relief.

69
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,160
I just want to know

70
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,640
where Wang Ping is.

71
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,160
Brother.

72
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,160
Brother, listen to me.

73
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,640
I really don't know where Wang Ping is.

74
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:33,920
I—

75
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,640
I truly don't know.

76
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,160
You have to believe me.

77
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:35,800
How about this—

78
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,560
Let's make a deal.

79
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,160
Your life—

80
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,760
you choose for yourself.

81
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:41,840
Alright.

82
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,800
Tonight,

83
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,760
only one of you brothers

84
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,320
can survive.

85
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,400
Okay, okay.

86
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:48,840
Okay.

87
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,160
Captain Lu.

88
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,360
What's going on?

89
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,360
Captain Lu.

90
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,280
No one's at Luo Yi's home.

91
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,840
Any other immediate family?

92
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,760
His wife passed away.

93
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:11,600
His daughter too.

94
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,200
His family is

95
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,360
all gone now.

96
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,280
Darn it.

97
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,320
He's got nothing left to lose.

98
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:18,600
Go, now.

99
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,480
Eighteen years

100
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,120
Eighteen years...

101
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,200
Daughter

102
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,240
Today, your father

103
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,720
can finally avenge you himself

104
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,480
Drink with my brother

105
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,560
Come on, come on

106
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,240
Drink some more

107
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,840
Give a hug

108
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,240
Hold tight

109
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,320
Hold on

110
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:48,960
Alright

111
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:49,600
Hold on

112
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,360
Cheers

113
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:50,680
Have a drink

114
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,360
Okay, okay

115
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,440
I'll drink, I'll drink

116
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,560
Not drinking enough

117
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:53,880
Come on, together

118
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,200
Me

119
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,720
Then I'll finish mine

120
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,120
Then I'll finish mine

121
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,320
You all drink too

122
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:58,680
Brother

123
00:05:59,320 --> 00:05:59,720
Take a call

124
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,680
Go handle your stuff

125
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,640
Take care of my brother

126
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,160
You do your thing

127
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,680
Of course, I will

128
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,560
Come on, let's keep drinking

129
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,400
Let's start, just us two

130
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:05,920
Let's finish one first

131
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,760
I won't drink anymore

132
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,760
Not feeling well

133
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,400
Alright then

134
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:08,760
So

135
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,480
Beauty

136
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:09,840
Come on, just us two

137
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,320
Hey, Xiao Jia

138
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,400
Your last hairstyle

139
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:13,920
Where did you get it done

140
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,200
I got a membership at that place

141
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,040
I'll take you there next time

142
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,560
And those press-on nails last time

143
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,280
How did yours turn out

144
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,360
About that shop

145
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,040
I'll come over and tell you

146
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,120
That shop from last time

147
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,680
The staff there

148
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,840
Their service is excellent

149
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,760
Oh, that guy you recommended last time

150
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,160
How was he

151
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,160
Oh, him

152
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,120
Instead of hanging out with these jailbirds

153
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,080
Better to have fun with that guy, right

154
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,120
I think so too

155
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,280
And he's definitely more handsome

156
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:38,840
Yeah

157
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,240
Big brother

158
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,360
Big brother

159
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,280
After tonight

160
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,080
Our debt

161
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,520
Can we call it even

162
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,280
Tonight

163
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,520
Settle everything

164
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,520
Okay

165
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,320
Right here

166
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,520
Sister Li Ya

167
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Surveillance found Luo Yi's car

168
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,400
Let's go

169
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:52,760
Oh, oh, oh

170
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,440
Xiao Yu

171
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,240
Watch the place

172
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:54,600
Okay

173
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:14,680
Sis

174
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,880
Do you think Captain Lu will make it in time

175
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,280
Can they find Wang Ping

176
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,880
Luo Yi went to this address

177
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,400
But it's not confirmed yet

178
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,520
Xiao Yu is contacting the local police

179
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,960
This old Luo

180
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,000
He hasn't done anything stupid yet, right

181
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,120
A few stabs nearly hit vital spots

182
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,680
Luckily, he got to the hospital in time

183
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,600
The injured is out of danger now

184
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,360
Got it

185
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:37,920
Thanks

186
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,440
You're welcome

187
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:45,840
Captain Lu

188
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,240
Wang Feng is fine

189
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,040
How about

190
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,440
I first

191
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,240
take him back for questioning

192
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:49,800
Mm

193
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:52,680
Yes

194
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:58,680
Alright

195
00:09:59,240 --> 00:09:59,600
I know

196
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,800
After you finish questioning Wang Feng

197
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,240
Keep him here

198
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,160
I have something to ask him

199
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,360
All done

200
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,120
Have the team below

201
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:11,920
expand the search area.

202
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,160
What are we looking for?

203
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:15,920
Let's go.

204
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,160
Xiao Chen,

205
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,840
go to the forensic center
and get the test report.

206
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:23,800
Captain Lu,

207
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,360
this is Wang Ping's
previous interview notes.

208
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,160
What is this?

209
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,680
Dirty money.

210
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,280
Oh.

211
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,600
Dirty money.

212
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,280
Don't just stand there.

213
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,240
The forensic center is waiting.

214
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:34,840
Hurry up.

215
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,560
Minmin,

216
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,120
no need to go.

217
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,000
Wang Ping's head suffered

218
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:40,720
multiple blunt force impacts.

219
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,840
His skull was severely deformed.

220
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,360
And the stab wound to the heart?

221
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,160
It's also clear.

222
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,920
The weapon found in Luo Yi

223
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,800
matches the marks exactly.

224
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,680
The fingerprints left on the weapon

225
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,280
match both the victim

226
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,040
and the suspect completely.

227
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:52,680
By the way, sis,

228
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,360
what about Luo Yi's cause of death?

229
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,600
Luo Yi,

230
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,040
he must have fought for a long time.

231
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:57,800
On his body,

232
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,800
there are many stab and cut wounds.

233
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,360
Several nearly hit vital organs.

234
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,600
But we didn't find any hesitation wounds.

235
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,480
So,

236
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,680
suicide can be ruled out.

237
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:05,800
Luo Yi

238
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,480
must have held on with his last breath

239
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,480
until the very end.

240
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,360
After confirming Wang Ping was dead,

241
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,160
he finally collapsed from blood loss

242
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,920
and fell into a coma,

243
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,240
passing away soon after.

244
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,240
You can imagine

245
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,240
the scene at that moment

246
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,160
was extremely brutal.

247
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,560
It's been eighteen years.

248
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,680
Now Luo Yi

249
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,440
can finally reunite with Luo Xiaomei.

250
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,640
This case really took my breath away.

251
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,760
So Wang Ping is dead,

252
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,960
but Wang Feng is still alive, right?
