1
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,880
You mean

2
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,440
someone has been following you

3
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,920
and using it to threaten you?

4
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,280
Yeah.

5
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:44,800
How long has it been?

6
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,360
It's been three months.

7
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,440
Do you have any suspects?

8
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,800
Gao Zhixiang.

9
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,240
Probably.

10
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,240
It should be him.

11
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,080
Who is he?

12
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,440
My ex-boyfriend.

13
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,360
But I've already asked him.

14
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,280
Then tell me

15
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,640
what exactly happened.

16
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,280
Oh.

17
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,080
That's pretty heavy.

18
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,240
Let me help you.

19
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,920
No, no, it's fine.

20
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,640
Just treat me to dinner later.

21
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,640
When will you treat me to dinner?

22
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,160
Ya-jie.

23
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,640
This case—

24
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,280
what do you think?

25
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,080
Based on what Wang Qianqian said,

26
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,160
Gao Zhixiang is a strong suspect.

27
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And usually in cases like this,

28
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,680
it's more likely someone familiar did it.

29
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,760
Right.

30
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,440
But still,

31
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,720
if we take this back,

32
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,680
maybe the case will be solved.

33
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,280
We still have Xiaoyu here.

34
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,280
That's true.

35
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:46,720
Cut.

36
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:47,600
Pass.

37
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,040
Scene change.

38
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,040
Episode thirty-six, part two.

39
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,000
Everyone, get ready.

40
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,200
Director.

41
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:52,960
What's our next scene?

42
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,160
Someone's still not here.

43
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:54,960
Let's wait until they arrive.

44
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:55,560
Alright.

45
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:56,760
Next scene—

46
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,600
there are more shots.

47
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,040
I think

48
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,680
you should write each shot in detail.

49
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,600
Make sure it's well written.

50
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,960
No more mistakes allowed.

51
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:02,480
Got it?

52
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,160
Director.

53
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:03,960
Thanks for your hard work.

54
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,600
This was a great job.

55
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,840
Super impressive.

56
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,120
I'm exhausted.

57
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,120
What a crappy show.

58
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:11,880
Sis, have some water.

59
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,160
Where's Li-jie?

60
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,280
Li-jie.

61
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,200
She should be having lunch with the producer.

62
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,600
Discussing your upcoming schedule.

63
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,160
I'm working hard to earn money here,

64
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,680
while she's enjoying a meal.

65
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,280
And I still have to share my earnings with her.

66
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,160
She—

67
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,720
Why are you spacing out?

68
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,440
Touch up your makeup.

69
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,560
Isn't she absolutely gorgeous?

70
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,440
She just starred in a new TV drama.

71
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,040
It's really good.

72
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,160
She has a look in it that's truly stunning.

73
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,480
It's really great.

74
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,280
Super beautiful.

75
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:48,880
What are you talking about?

76
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,120
You all seem so happy.

77
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,280
It's a topic we girls love.

78
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,440
Come on, tell me.

79
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,280
Don't be so secretive.

80
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,440
Isn't she pretty?

81
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,600
Her name is Yang Jiaying.

82
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,200
She's my favorite idol right now.

83
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,200
She's beautiful,

84
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,280
and so dedicated.

85
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,680
Where else could you find someone like that?

86
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,440
You young girls, all day long...

87
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,120
I just don't get it.

88
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:07,720
Come on.

89
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,320
Let's go, let's go.

90
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,200
How's the progress?

91
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,280
Wang Qianqian.

92
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,400
She's a college student.

93
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,720
Her social circle is very simple.

94
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,320
According to her,

95
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,720
that person might be her ex-boyfriend.

96
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,880
You nodded.

97
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,440
You talk like you have proof.

98
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,960
Cases like this,

99
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,120
it's usually the ex-boyfriend.

100
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,960
How many cases have you handled?

101
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,840
So am I right or not?

102
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:32,760
Gao Zhixiang.

103
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:33,400
Male.

104
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:33,960
Twenty years old.

105
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,640
Graduated from Zhendan College.

106
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,200
Majored in auto repair.

107
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,400
Judging by his grades and resume,

108
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,840
he doesn't seem skilled with computers.

109
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,200
Xiaoyu.

110
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,840
The devices Wang Qianqian brought back,

111
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,640
the electronics.

112
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,200
How's the check going?

113
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,600
Wang Qianqian's computer

114
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,840
was infected with spyware.

115
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,520
This program

116
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,960
uses system vulnerabilities

117
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,840
to gain top-level access.

118
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,760
It allows remote control of the computer.

119
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,200
How was the spyware installed?

120
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,080
Usually through

121
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,840
a USB drive or email.

122
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,520
Just opening the USB or email

123
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,160
will infect the device.

124
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,760
But Wang Qianqian's emails

125
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,760
have all been deleted.

126
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,520
I'm working on recovering them.

127
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,080
If the spyware

128
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,760
was in the email or USB,

129
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,880
shouldn't it only infect one device?

130
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,840
Why are all her electronics

131
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,840
infected with spyware?

132
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,640
This spyware acts like a virus.

133
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,440
It can replicate itself.

134
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,520
Simply put,

135
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:15,880
it means

136
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,080
all devices on the same network

137
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:18,760
will get infected.

138
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,840
So doesn't that mean

139
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,280
we're infected too?

140
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,520
Any related files

141
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,760
I process them in a sandbox.

142
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,200
So everyone can relax.

143
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,320
You really need to be careful.

144
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,160
There are only important files here.

145
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,160
Don't mess anything up.

146
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:30,840
Don't worry.

147
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:35,880
Xiaoyu.

148
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,280
Speak.

149
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,320
Hello, Captain Lu.

150
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,320
I've recovered Wang Qianqian's emails.

151
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,840
The email with spyware

152
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,760
I traced the IP address.

153
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,080
It's Gao Zhixiang's neighborhood.

154
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,840
We can almost confirm

155
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,640
that email

156
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,520
was sent by Gao Zhixiang.

157
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,640
On his computer,

158
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,160
there should be a control program.

159
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,000
If we find that program,

160
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,840
it can be evidence for the prosecution.

161
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:55,440
Okay.

162
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:56,720
Xiaoyu, here's the plan:

163
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,400
Let's meet

164
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,320
at Gao Zhixiang's place.

165
00:06:59,280 --> 00:06:59,440
Alright.

166
00:06:59,600 --> 00:06:59,880
No problem.

167
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,640
What's your relationship with Wang Qianqian?

168
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,080
She's my ex-girlfriend.

169
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,760
When was your last contact?

170
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,400
When was it?

171
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,840
I haven't contacted her in a long time.

172
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,200
So why did you break up?

173
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,760
We...

174
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,280
just felt we weren't right for each other.

175
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,280
So we broke up peacefully.

176
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,080
A peaceful breakup?

177
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,400
You stalked Wang Qianqian,

178
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,600
made her move again,

179
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,600
and lose her job.

180
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,320
You call that a peaceful breakup?

181
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,160
Why did you install spyware

182
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,960
on her computer?

183
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,080
I didn't.

184
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,280
Gao Zhixiang.

185
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,640
Whatever I ask you now,

186
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,960
you'd better be honest.

187
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,600
If we find something first,

188
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,400
and you only talk then,

189
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,000
it'll be a whole different matter.

190
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:51,840
Do you understand?

191
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:53,520
Captain Lu.

192
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,280
That doesn't make sense.

193
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,320
Xiaoyu clearly tracked the IP

194
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,640
to Gao Zhixiang's neighborhood.

195
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,640
But on Gao Zhixiang's computer,

196
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,960
there's not a single trace.

197
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,520
I went through Gao Zhixiang's records

198
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,520
again, very carefully.

199
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,760
After he graduated,

200
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,400
he never had a steady job.

201
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,080
Other than loafing around,

202
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,400
there's nothing special about him.

203
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,640
So if that's the case,

204
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,880
Gao Zhixiang

205
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,720
doesn't have the skills

206
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,760
to create this spyware.

207
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:25,960
So the spyware he put

208
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,520
on Wang Qianqian's computer

209
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,080
was most likely

210
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,600
bought from an illegal source.

211
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,440
But here's what I'm thinking—

212
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,760
Gao Zhixiang could buy the spyware,

213
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,760
but to erase all traces

214
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,960
so thoroughly from his computer,

215
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,840
he couldn't have done it alone.

216
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,400
So it must be connected

217
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,520
to the seller who sold him the software.

218
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,640
They're definitely involved.

219
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:43,720
Captain Lu.

220
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,600
We found a record

221
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,320
of Gao Zhixiang buying cryptocurrency.

222
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,520
I suspect it was used

223
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,400
to buy the spyware.

224
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,280
Qilu.

225
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:56,840
Let's go.

226
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,400
Gao Zhixiang's place.

227
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:02,440
Are you there?

228
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,760
The cops are onto me. What do I do?

229
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,960
Then just die.

230
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,280
Open up!

231
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,200
Gao Zhixiang!

232
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,160
Darn it, did this guy run off?

233
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,320
Gao Zhixiang!

234
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,320
He couldn't have left that fast.

235
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:33,880
Knock again.

236
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:37,720
Gao Zhixiang!

237
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,200
Hold on a second.

238
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:55,920
Notify forensics.

239
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,720
Gao Zhixiang is dead.

240
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,680
The final forensic report

241
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,040
says it was status epilepticus.

242
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,320
He didn't get timely treatment,

243
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:02,920
so he died.

244
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,120
What a coincidence.

245
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,720
We were just about to arrest him,

246
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,440
and now he's gone.

247
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,240
Yeah.

248
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,480
I think something's off too.

249
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,560
Based on the room's layout,

250
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,960
and the way he and the chair were facing,

251
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,040
he was looking at

252
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:14,840
the computer before he died.

253
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,720
But he died from epilepsy.

254
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,320
You can't say the computer killed him.

255
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,320
Maybe the computer really did kill him.

256
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,920
Come on, we're solving a case here.

257
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,720
Don't start with that superstitious stuff.

258
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,720
High-frequency flashes

259
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,080
can trigger photosensitive epilepsy.

260
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,720
Based on the room's layout,

261
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,040
but in this room,

262
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,440
there's no sign anyone else came in.

263
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,200
Could it have been someone he knew?

264
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,200
Xiaoyu.

265
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,480
If we go by what Captain Lu said,

266
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,320
this case

267
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,600
is linked to the spyware seller.

268
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,200
If that's true,

269
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,960
then his computer

270
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,440
might have been controlled by someone else.

271
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,120
I need to check his computer.

272
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:52,720
But

273
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,800
it's possible.

274
00:10:59,560 --> 00:10:59,920
Hello?

275
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:00,680
Captain Lu.

276
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,440
Someone filed a report.

277
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:01,840
Okay.

278
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,320
Got it.

279
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,080
Chen Minmin, come with me.

280
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:04,960
The rest of you, keep investigating.

281
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,800
Don't be upset.

282
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:16,840
Officer,

283
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,960
please hurry up

284
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,440
and find the person who filmed me.

285
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,560
He's really despicable.

286
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,120
No, wait—

287
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,840
This is a crime!

288
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,600
You need to arrest him right away.

289
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,840
You have no idea

290
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,320
how much I've suffered because of him.

291
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,680
I lost tons of endorsements,

292
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,200
and had to pay breach-of-contract fees everywhere.

293
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,080
Who's the man in the video?

294
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:39,720
Who is he?

295
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,840
He's the director of my current show.

296
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,920
Why do you look so down?

297
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,600
Sigh.

298
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,440
I'm never following celebrities again.

299
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,120
Stars in private

300
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,720
are nothing like they are on screen.

301
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,080
What are you saying, kid?

302
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,960
What kind of case is this?

303
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,800
Someone was secretly filmed.

304
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,360
Now it's all over foreign websites.

305
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,080
Weibo is blowing up.

306
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,040
What video?

307
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,440
Why is it such a big deal?

308
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,960
Yang Jiaying and the director

309
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,600
in a private hotel video.

310
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,560
What?

311
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,160
Who's Yang Jiaying?

312
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,960
As for the video,

313
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,800
no one knows who filmed it.

314
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,560
But one thing's certain—

315
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,600
it was shot in the director's room.

316
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,320
So that means

317
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,600
the target was the director.

318
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,240
Yang Jiaying just got caught in the crossfire.

319
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,720
I think so too.

320
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,920
Once this video gets out,

321
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,840
it'll hit the director hard too.

322
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:43,440
Chen Minmin.

323
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,320
Come with me again tomorrow.

324
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,840
Everyone else, keep working the case.

325
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,040
All right.

326
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,720
Here at your place

327
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,920
Who usually comes here?

328
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,840
Oh, that's a long list.

329
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,680
Officer, please don't misunderstand.

330
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,320
People often come here, that's normal.

331
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,560
For creative work and such.

332
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,000
This officer here—

333
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:08,840
Please, have a seat.

334
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,280
Mm-hmm.

335
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,480
Is it possible someone here

336
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,800
secretly installed surveillance here?

337
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,680
That I really don't know.

338
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,560
Officer,

339
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,320
What do you think he's after?

340
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,160
What does he really want?

341
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,720
If it's about money,

342
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,040
just name the amount.

343
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,120
I'll transfer it right away.

344
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,080
No one exposes things right off the bat.

345
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,440
That's not how this business works.

346
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,720
Deliberate revenge.

347
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,840
Have you offended anyone lately?

348
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,920
I don't think so.

349
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,080
Maybe just on set—

350
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,040
if someone messed up the job,

351
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,040
I might've scolded them a bit.

352
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,120
That's all, nothing else.

353
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:44,960
Did you find anything here?

354
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,200
Nothing so far.

355
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,600
Even if there was surveillance,

356
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,960
it would've been removed by now.

357
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,040
Alright.

358
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:51,920
Let's leave it for now.

359
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,600
If you find anything,

360
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,480
contact us anytime.

361
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:56,840
Of course.

362
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,200
I'll fully cooperate with you.

363
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:58,720
Officer,

364
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,320
I really want to know too

365
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,200
which bastard

366
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,800
is so eager to harm me.

367
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:05,800
Thank you.

368
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,480
Officer,

369
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:08,840
Wait a moment.

370
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,320
Pointless.

371
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,320
From the surveillance footage,

372
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,440
the only ones who entered the director's room alone

373
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,440
were Yang Jiaying and the cleaning lady.

374
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,720
But Yang Jiaying is the victim,

375
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:25,840
so it's unlikely.

376
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,840
Even less likely the cleaning lady.

377
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,320
She's worked here for years.

378
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,440
And she's always been honest.

379
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,440
But nowadays,

380
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,320
aren't there people hired to dig up celebrity gossip

381
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,840
and buy it for high prices?

382
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,480
Excuse me,

383
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,240
this cleaning lady of yours,
