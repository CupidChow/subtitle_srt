1
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,480
Taste of Home company director

2
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,240
Xue Ming

3
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,840
So blatant

4
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:19,960
Anyway

5
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,360
He's the prime suspect now

6
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,520
He has a motive for murder too

7
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:23,480
Chain of evidence

8
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,480
is basically complete

9
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,600
Since that's the case

10
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,960
Let's detain him first and question him

11
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,280
There's something

12
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,720
Cheng Xue has a daughter

13
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,680
Her death certificate was just issued

14
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,600
Do you know why you were transferred

15
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,920
from economic crime to homicide?

16
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,680
I want to know too

17
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,680
Someone died after

18
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,040
eating our beef soup

19
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,040
Are they trying to frame us?

20
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,280
Do you know this person?

21
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:03,720
Yes

22
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:04,920
That jerk

23
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,120
Why pretend to be a hero

24
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,160
He's just

25
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,720
just a shameless liar

26
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,120
A liar

27
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,840
From what we know

28
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,280
Zhang Di worked undercover

29
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,920
in companies with food safety issues

30
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,120
exposing this info to the public

31
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:19,720
So far

32
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,520
this information

33
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,840
has no issues

34
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,160
And your own problems

35
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,960
I think you know best

36
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,600
Officer

37
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,480
I just got back from a business trip

38
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,280
and only learned about the quality issue

39
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,480
We're trying to fix it too

40
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,480
First, tell me

41
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,000
what happened with Zhang Di's car

42
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,040
Officer

43
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,120
This matter

44
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,680
is a long story

45
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,560
I'm not in a rush

46
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,240
Take your time

47
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,800
Zhang Di and I

48
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,320
actually met at the card table

49
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,760
He's got a serious gambling problem

50
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:44,760
Thanks

51
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,000
Si'er, give him the phone

52
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,000
Why gamble if you're broke

53
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,560
Get lost

54
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,680
Just a poor loser

55
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,320
Lost everything

56
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,360
Still came to borrow money from us

57
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,560
After he learned who I was

58
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,880
he snuck into our factory

59
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,360
With so many people in our company

60
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,560
if he hadn't talked to me at the table

61
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,560
how would I know

62
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,120
he was undercover in our factory?

63
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,360
What did he say to you?

64
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,560
What

65
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,760
He just wanted money

66
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,240
He already had

67
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,560
evidence against me

68
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,120
He blackmailed you?

69
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,560
Of course he did

70
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,880
It wasn't a huge amount

71
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:36,800
How much?

72
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,240
One million

73
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,760
That's nothing for you

74
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,920
You gave it to him?

75
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:45,920
I did

76
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,280
But after he got the money

77
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,520
he still drove that junk car

78
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,880
to my house to annoy me

79
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,120
I didn't want any more trouble with him

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,400
So I let Xiao Jin drive it away

81
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,120
Officer

82
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,600
I'm really innocent

83
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:01,960
I didn't do anything

84
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,600
Quiet for a moment

85
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,120
Li Ya

86
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,760
This Xue Ming

87
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,360
has an alibi

88
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,240
It's solid

89
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,600
Are you sure?

90
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,400
Here's the file

91
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,480
What is it

92
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,280
Hit a snag?

93
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,480
It's fine, Lao Ji

94
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,480
I'll think it over

95
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,640
Li Ya

96
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,760
Sometimes

97
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,240
taking a step back

98
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,880
lets you see things clearer

99
00:05:59,560 --> 00:05:59,880
Thanks

100
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,880
Thank you, officer

101
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,360
I'm not very hungry

102
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:03,840
Thanks

103
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,440
Let's continue then

104
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,280
Tell me what you know about Zhang Di

105
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,000
Ah

106
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,520
How should I put it

107
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,360
He gives me the impression

108
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,560
of being complicated

109
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,320
His biggest problem

110
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:16,680
is

111
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,040
he loves gambling too much

112
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:19,640
Once

113
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,880
his kid had surgery

114
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,480
and he forgot all about it

115
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:21,720
What?

116
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,160
He told you that?

117
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:23,720
No, no

118
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,040
Once he made a call

119
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,720
I overheard it

120
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,360
He was arguing with someone

121
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,360
Saying

122
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,120
he didn't forget the kid's surgery

123
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,960
but something urgent came up

124
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,320
He had bad luck that day

125
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,480
and lost terribly

126
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,040
Altogether it was about

127
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,280
two or three hundred thousand

128
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,440
Afterward, he vented to me

129
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,560
Leukemia

130
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,200
Xiao Yu

131
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,280
Quick, check Cheng Xue's location

132
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,040
Let's go

133
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,720
Captain Lu was right after all.

134
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,280
Cheng Xue is out for revenge.

135
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,160
Zhang Di gambled away the surgery money.

136
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,080
He caused Cheng Xue's daughter to die.

137
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,880
Cheng Xue must truly hate him.

138
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,160
So,

139
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,800
she used such a brutal method.

140
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,720
Cheng Xue hid her daughter too well.

141
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,240
No one even knew about her.

142
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,280
Now Cheng Xue is completely broken.

143
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,440
Her grief covered up her hatred.

144
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,000
Well,

145
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,520
Let me add something.

146
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,000
Cheng Xue's daughter

147
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,800
might actually be Zhang Di's child.

148
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,240
What?

149
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,720
Darn it.

150
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,440
Cheng Xue is definitely in trouble.

151
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:32,640
No,

152
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,280
Lao Ji already took people to investigate.

153
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,520
They just can't find her.

154
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,800
But they'll get the child's DNA sample.

155
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:37,720
Besides,

156
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,800
Xiao Yu already sent

157
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,360
the birth certificate

158
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,000
over.

159
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,680
Hurry, tell us.

160
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,080
Come on.

161
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,080
Pause your work for a moment.

162
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,080
I have something to say.

163
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,560
Our department is organizing

164
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,080
a charity donation for terminally ill kids.

165
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,360
This QR code

166
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,400
is totally voluntary.

167
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,520
One hundred, two hundred—

168
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,120
no amount is too small.

169
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,320
Even a thousand, eight hundred—never too much.

170
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,640
Give as much or as little as you wish.

171
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,120
But I still hope everyone

172
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:21,800
will be proactive.

173
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:22,920
Be proactive.

174
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,560
Alright.

175
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:24,960
Come on, everyone.

176
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:25,920
Our team

177
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,960
really needs to step up.

178
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,040
This is a good deed.

179
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:29,760
Captain Ji,

180
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,920
how much are you donating?

181
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,080
Don't worry about my amount.

182
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,120
Just do what you feel is right.

183
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:36,920
Sister Ya,

184
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,040
how much did you give?

185
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,360
Why do you care?

186
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,320
Our Mobile Unit

187
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,920
donated the highest amount

188
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,640
in the whole department.

189
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,960
Sixty-nine thousand seven hundred.

190
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,800
Sixty-nine thousand seven hundred.

191
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,520
Who was it?

192
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:05,960
Qizi.

193
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:06,800
I gave two thousand.

194
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,240
And you?

195
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,200
I gave two thousand.

196
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,360
Captain Ji,

197
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,320
No, no, no.

198
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,520
I gave the same amount.

199
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,880
I gave one thousand seven hundred.

200
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,320
That's all I had in my account.

201
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,240
On behalf of

202
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,000
the Mobile Unit,

203
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:27,760
thank you.

204
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,120
And thanks from those kids, too.

205
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:33,960
Minmin,

206
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,440
I never thought you were secretly rich.

207
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,120
No,

208
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,000
just a little well-off.

209
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,960
A little wealth is still wealth.

210
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:40,680
Minmin,

211
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,200
When I stepped on your foot last time,

212
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,320
I really didn't mean it.

213
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,320
Don't take it to heart.

214
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:45,960
I'll hit him for you.

215
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:46,760
I already did.

216
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,680
But let's skip Japanese food tonight.

217
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,080
Steak.

218
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:51,880
Hot pot.

219
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,320
I suggest

220
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,000
we eat

221
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,240
Northeastern Iron Pot

222
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,640
Stewed Goose.

223
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,760
Tonight, it's on me.

224
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,440
That's great.

225
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,560
Never tried it.

226
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,840
Never tried it, never tried it.
