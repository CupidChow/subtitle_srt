1
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,240
Sorry.

2
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,920
This is the first time I've seen this photo.

3
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,560
I didn't know.

4
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,800
Li Xiaozhi cared so deeply for me.

5
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,360
I even...

6
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,440
never managed to tell him

7
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,480
my real name.

8
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,360
I couldn't

9
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,920
be his girlfriend in real life.

10
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,560
Victim:

11
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,240
Zhou Jinwen.

12
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Advertising industry

13
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,480
professional.

14
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,120
On his own rooftop,

15
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,880
he jumped to his death.

16
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,120
We already checked his social circle.

17
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,680
His friends said

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,880
his girlfriend

19
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,000
and Li Xiaozhi's girlfriend

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,680
were the same person.

21
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,560
Tao Weiyi.

22
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,000
We looked into this before.

23
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,040
This

24
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,640
Tao Weiyi and Zhou Jinwen

25
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,640
had only just met.

26
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,680
This Tao Weiyi

27
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,040
moved into Zhou Jinwen's place.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,800
Both victims we've found so far

29
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,640
are connected to this woman.

30
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,440
Oh my god.

31
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,560
Female Conan.

32
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,920
Looks like Tao Weiyi

33
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,240
is scarier than we thought.

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,360
Lily.

35
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,240
Lolita.

36
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,240
How should

37
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,240
I address you?

38
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:35,680
This is

39
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,360
the city bureau's

40
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,000
mobile unit's

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,560
interrogation room.

42
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,560
We called you in

43
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,880
and you know exactly why.

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,360
Is it a crime to date too much?

45
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,360
Or do you cops

46
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,560
care if I change my English name?

47
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,120
It's not a crime.

48
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,240
But

49
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,120
this Zhou Jinwen

50
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,240
had an anniversary with you

51
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,560
on April fifteenth.

52
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,440
He jumped

53
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,200
on May fourth.

54
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,000
And Li Xiaozhi.

55
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,240
This

56
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,000
Officer Qi

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,640
was investigating

58
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,000
the reason for his suicide

59
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,640
and came to see you.

60
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,760
You should know.

61
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,120
Seems you've figured it all out.

62
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:13,920
Yes.

63
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,800
I'm just like them.

64
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,680
We're all

65
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,360
people with nothing left to live for.

66
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,360
Severe depression patients.

67
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,000
You'll never understand.

68
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,320
Suicide

69
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,560
is the only

70
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,440
way out for us.

71
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,240
Mm.

72
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,640
They killed themselves.

73
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,240
But you're still alive and well.

74
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,200
To be honest with you,

75
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:33,800
Tao Weiyi,

76
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,640
we already have

77
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,000
evidence you incited multiple suicides.

78
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,920
What can you even find?

79
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,560
A few more lines of chat logs?

80
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,320
Do you understand depression?

81
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,360
Do you understand me?

82
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,360
You...

83
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,680
You're just

84
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,040
hiding behind your pain,

85
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,680
living off the scraps of others' affection

86
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,120
to

87
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,880
keep yourself going, a pitiful soul.

88
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,800
Honestly,

89
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,240
if you hadn't caused someone's death,

90
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,040
no one would care about you.

91
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,440
Tao Weiyi,

92
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,440
do you have anyone

93
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,440
you truly care about in this world?

94
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,360
Or let me ask you another way:

95
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,360
do you think there's

96
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,040
anyone who truly cares about you?

97
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,640
Yes.

98
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,440
I do.

99
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:21,920
I have my lover.

100
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,440
Someone I love.

101
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,760
And someone who loves me.

102
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,240
But they're all dead now.

103
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,200
What did I do wrong?

104
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,880
I just helped them find relief.

105
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,640
You said Li Xiaozhi—

106
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,800
he was bullied at school.

107
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,680
His mother didn't even care.

108
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,560
And Zhou Jinwen—

109
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,360
he clearly had depression.

110
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,240
The people around him

111
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,800
all kept

112
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,560
forcing him

113
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,200
to wear that pathetic

114
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,760
smiling mask.

115
00:04:59,320 --> 00:04:59,960
Only I

116
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:01,760
Only I

117
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,240
could help them escape.

118
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,760
Did you get all that down?

119
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,160
You're truly pathetic.

120
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,480
Suspect's done talking.

121
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,160
Let's go.

122
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,120
It doesn't matter anymore.

123
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,120
In the end,

124
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,000
we all end up in the arms
of the Gloombird.

125
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,120
The question now is,

126
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,080
between Tao Weiyi and Zhou Jinwen,

127
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,760
there was real affection.

128
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,480
At least,

129
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,240
Tao Weiyi probably wouldn't

130
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,520
want Zhou Jinwen to die.

131
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,360
And also,

132
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,120
Zhou Jinwen

133
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,880
didn't seem strongly suicidal.

134
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,240
Captain Lu,

135
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,000
Captain Lu,

136
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,240
Zhou Jinwen's

137
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,120
death and Li Xiaozhi's death

138
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,880
are definitely different.

139
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,480
Li Xiaozhi jumped at home.

140
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,840
But Zhou Jinwen lived on the ninth floor,

141
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,640
yet went up to the rooftop.

142
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
He arrived there long before.

143
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,640
I'm sure

144
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,760
he arranged to meet someone up there.

145
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,240
Was it Tao Weiyi?

146
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:05,720
No.

147
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,840
She has an alibi.

148
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,240
This is from the stairwell camera,

149
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,240
a suspicious person caught on tape.

150
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,640
Target is still unclear.

151
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,960
But one thing is certain:

152
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,000
he

153
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,080
isn't a resident here.

154
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,880
If that's the case,

155
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,120
based on our current evidence,

156
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,360
Tao Weiyi

157
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,520
really didn't want Zhou Jinwen dead.

158
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,400
So Zhou Jinwen

159
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,360
was likely forced by this mystery person

160
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:30,760
to his death,

161
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,120
maybe even murdered.

162
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,120
Qizi,

163
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:33,720
Li Ya,

164
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,640
go to Tao Weiyi's complex.

165
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,240
You'll definitely find something.

166
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,080
Go.

167
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,000
Hello.

168
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:44,880
May I ask,

169
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,000
in our complex,

170
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,240
do you keep visitor records?

171
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,080
Do you have them?

172
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,760
Except for residents,

173
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,120
strangers entering our complex

174
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,840
must register.

175
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,520
Don't worry,

176
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,760
our complex is very safe.

177
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,240
This resident,

178
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,480
her usual visitors,

179
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,160
do you remember any?

180
00:06:59,640 --> 00:06:59,880
I've seen them.

181
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,000
She rarely has visitors.

182
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:02,880
Just her boyfriend

183
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,520
comes often.

184
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,000
Is it him?

185
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:06,880
Yes, yes.

186
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,640
That's him.

187
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,240
Alright.

188
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,480
No.

189
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,880
Why do you keep laughing?

190
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,720
Besides the one in the photo,

191
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,880
there should be another.

192
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,640
Another one?

193
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,160
Boyfriend?

194
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,400
Recently,

195
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,000
she was with another man,

196
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,360
very close too.

197
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,560
Let's go.

198
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,840
Take me to your surveillance room.

199
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:31,640
Alright.

200
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,080
Captain Lu,

201
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,040
we found

202
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,080
there's likely another victim.

203
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,080
But after questioning,

204
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:45,840
she won't say anything.

205
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:46,800
Investigate.

206
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,160
Dig up everything on Tao Weiyi.

207
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:53,680
Qilu,

208
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,040
speak.

209
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,400
Captain Lu,

210
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,160
the guard just said

211
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,520
besides Zhou Jinwen,

212
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,760
Tao Weiyi has another boyfriend.

213
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:01,800
He could very well be

214
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,040
the one we're looking for,

215
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,640
the other accomplice.

216
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,320
Hmm.

217
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,520
According to the guard,

218
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,400
the two of them

219
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,760
have dated for about a year and a half.

220
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,920
He says the man's accent

221
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,920
and his luggage

222
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,520
suggest he's based in West Beijing,

223
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,160
and sometimes flies to Rongcheng

224
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,200
to meet Tao Weiyi.

225
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,560
It seems

226
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,520
they're very much in love.

227
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,440
But

228
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,200
for a while,

229
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,080
his visits overlapped

230
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,040
with Zhou Jinwen's.

231
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:22,760
They coincided.

232
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,560
So basically,

233
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,760
Tao Weiyi was two-timing.

234
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,320
Any other details?

235
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,560
Tao Weiyi is a bit odd.

236
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,040
She came to Rongcheng alone these years,

237
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,560
barely made any friends.

238
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:35,960
I checked around.

239
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,800
Her circle—

240
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,080
photographers and model colleagues—

241
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,440
say they never knew

242
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,760
she had a boyfriend like that.

243
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,080
It's like she deliberately

244
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,520
kept him hidden.

245
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,280
Alright.

246
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:45,920
Head back first.

247
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,040
We'll meet at the station.

248
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:47,840
Okay.

249
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,040
Let's go.

250
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,560
Captain Lu

251
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,320
I checked Tao Weiyi's

252
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,320
food delivery records

253
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,320
and found this man's details.

254
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,800
Hu Youfeng

255
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,160
Male

256
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,760
Thirty-three years old

257
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,840
From Southwest Beijing

258
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,520
Creative director at a media company

259
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,200
And this morning

260
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,080
I got a message

261
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,680
The victim who jumped yesterday morning

262
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:10,760
Surname Xue

263
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,080
From Jinshan, Rong District

264
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,160
She also had The Owl's Mark on her arm

265
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,920
She became more withdrawn a month before death

266
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:17,800
More and more isolated

267
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,520
Can we check this victim's

268
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,160
social media history?

269
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,080
Preliminary results show

270
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,800
She met an online boyfriend thirty days ago

271
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,520
He encouraged her to commit suicide

272
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,040
I think

273
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,200
this person must be Hu Youfeng

274
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,680
I've already found his exact location

275
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,280
So it seems

276
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,560
Hu Youfeng and Tao Weiyi

277
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,320
planned this together

278
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,440
They want to

279
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,040
deliberately create these suicide cases

280
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,440
to satisfy their

281
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,320
twisted psychological needs

282
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:37,520
I think

283
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,920
they're both highly controlling people

284
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,200
Like the King of Hell

285
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,040
crossing names off others' life ledgers

286
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,280
I've interrogated Tao Weiyi

287
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,040
I know her

288
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,520
She's just

289
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,560
a pawn for Hu Youfeng

290
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,320
Hu Youfeng uses

291
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,280
controlling this pawn

292
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,320
to control others

293
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,960
to satisfy his

294
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,560
twisted desires

295
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,400
So

296
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,440
we previously combined

297
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,440
Zhou Jinwen's case

298
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,320
with this one

299
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,440
but now we should

300
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,320
do the opposite

301
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,080
Treat this case

302
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,280
as two separate cases

303
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,560
Zhou Jinwen's death

304
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,640
is related to Tao Weiyi

305
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,280
cheating

306
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,440
for sure

307
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,560
It's a crime of passion

308
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,440
We can't charge him yet

309
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,640
but for now

310
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,760
Hu Youfeng is the prime suspect

311
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,000
We can bring him in for questioning

312
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,280
I have no idea what you're talking about

313
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,880
I just helped them out

314
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,960
That Xue woman

315
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,960
and those two men

316
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,520
I did them a big favor

317
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,360
No matter what I did

318
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,880
it was to give them courage

319
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,080
to do something

320
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,040
they'd decided on long ago

321
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,360
I'm not afraid of death

322
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,520
You are

323
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,720
You're afraid to lose

324
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,360
what you used to control

325
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:45,560
Like

326
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:46,760
love

327
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,240
How do you explain

328
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,720
you didn't know before

329
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,280
Answer my first question first

330
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,200
The remaining victim

331
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,760
Who is it

332
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,120
Where are they

333
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,560
Tao Weiyi

334
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,760
Your medical report is out

335
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,920
You're two months pregnant
