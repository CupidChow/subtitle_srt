1
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,040
Qilu

2
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,160
Jin Weihua

3
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,080
He works as a security guard
at Hui Du Guo Ji.

4
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,960
But we don't know which one.

5
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,080
Li Ya went in and then lost contact.

6
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:26,960
Hurry, take the team inside.

7
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,280
Quick!

8
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,960
Who were you calling just now?

9
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,080
What are you doing?

10
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:03,480
Police.

11
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,160
Here.

12
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,960
You heard everything?

13
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,160
That was Huamei just now.

14
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,280
Last time that jerk spilled booze on me.

15
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,720
Only you handed me a towel.

16
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,720
Since then,

17
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,720
I've always thought of you.

18
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:22,960
But I don't know

19
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,360
if you have a wife and kids.

20
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,800
So I asked Huamei to find out for me.

21
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:47,960
Anyone here?

22
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,040
What's wrong?

23
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,040
Are you okay?

24
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,400
Hello, is this 110?

25
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,640
You two, go over there.

26
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,280
Here.

27
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,920
Hey, hey.

28
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,440
Brother Wang.

29
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,800
When guests arrive soon,

30
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,000
we'll both lose our jobs.

31
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:46,920
Or,

32
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:47,520
I go to your place.

33
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,560
I just want to stay here.

34
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,640
Phone.

35
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,440
Hurry, retreat.

36
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:01,560
Hello?

37
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,440
Li Ya.

38
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,200
Rongcheng Police! Don't move!

39
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,200
The person in this photo—

40
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,080
Do you know them?

41
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:30,480
Yeah.

42
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,520
Sort of.

43
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,200
Why did you kill?

44
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,040
For money.

45
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,400
You killed so many people.

46
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,200
How much did you get?

47
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,040
Spent it all.

48
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,200
How would I remember?

49
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,440
I want to know

50
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,200
why you targeted

51
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,800
nightclub girls.

52
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,320
Why so many questions?

53
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,720
Their jobs

54
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,680
are very unstable.

55
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,960
Even if they die

56
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,040
or go missing,

57
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,440
rarely does anyone report it.

58
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,680
That's what you know.

59
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,320
But the ones I killed

60
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,040
are more than these.

61
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,560
These are real lives.

62
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:03,680
Lao Ji.

63
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,600
This time,

64
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,960
the Jin Weihua case was solved

65
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,760
thanks to Lao Ji.

66
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,960
If Lao Ji hadn't requested

67
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,600
a joint investigation,

68
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,600
we'd still be running

69
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,320
around like headless chickens.

70
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,760
searching everywhere.

71
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,240
Come.

72
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,440
It's just a pity for all those girls.

73
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,960
Jin Weihua is a real monster.

74
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,360
From what he said,

75
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,880
he killed more than just these.

76
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,000
There must be more bodies not found.

77
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,240
He chose victims

78
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,080
mostly illegal sex workers.

79
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,600
When they disappear,

80
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,240
no one dares report it.

81
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,080
Letting this beast

82
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,640
take advantage.

83
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,440
Alright.

84
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,080
Case solved.

85
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,520
I'll treat everyone to

86
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,680
crayfish.

87
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:56,880
Great!

88
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,160
Thanks, Brother Qi.

89
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,640
Solving this case

90
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,560
is justice for

91
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,640
the souls of the girls who died.

92
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,080
This meal

93
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,040
is on me.

94
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:11,920
Let's go.

95
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,440
Let's eat.

96
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:30,680
No.

97
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,360
Young girls

98
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,200
need to work this hard?

99
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,720
I have to be prepared.

100
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,960
If you haven't faced pain,

101
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,280
your police career

102
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:38,840
is

103
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,600
incomplete.

104
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,760
What are you doing?

105
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:47,960
Hello?

106
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,320
Lao Ji.

107
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:49,600
Captain Lu.

108
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,440
Listen to me.

109
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,040
Bring your team over quickly.

110
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:52,760
What's wrong?

111
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,960
There's a guy named Wang Feng,

112
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,160
just released from prison.

113
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,440
He might have

114
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,160
clues about his fugitive brother.

115
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,240
Where are you?

116
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,800
I'm five hundred meters south
on Xinyuan Avenue.

117
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,240
I'm watching him from my car.

118
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,080
Not good.

119
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,240
Target has entered the supermarket.

120
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:07,480
No.

121
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:07,960
Wait a second.

122
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,240
You first—

123
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,240
Lao Ji.

124
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,600
My punches were pretty good, right?

125
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,160
Yeah, not bad.

126
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,520
That

127
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,400
straight punch

128
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,680
landed right on my face.

129
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,160
Nice.

130
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:17,680
Xinyuan Avenue.

131
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,320
Old Lu.

132
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,760
Lao Ji's phone is off.

133
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,080
Something must've happened to Lao Ji.

134
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,040
Call Xiaoyu.

135
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,080
Have him check Lao Ji's phone location.

136
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,480
Captain Lu.

137
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,760
What a beast.

138
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,160
There’s more than one beast here.

139
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,280
This was eighteen years ago—

140
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,160
a home invasion rape and murder case.

141
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,160
Don't touch me.

142
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:21,760
Don't touch me.

143
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,440
Hurry!

144
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:25,640
Quick!

145
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,000
The suspects are criminal brothers.

146
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,000
The younger one is on the run.

147
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:29,760
The older one was caught.

148
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,360
Sentenced to eighteen years.

149
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,480
This is Lao Ji's case.

150
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,160
Such a light sentence.

151
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,760
So the older brother is out now.

152
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:35,880
Seems so.

153
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,440
This case was famous back then.

154
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,200
The older brother put all the blame

155
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,120
entirely

156
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,560
on his younger brother, Wang Ping.

157
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,640
He only admitted to one robbery.

158
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,600
And the evidence was weak at the time.

159
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,560
These two look exactly alike,

160
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,560
even their DNA matches.

161
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,880
Now the older brother's been released.

162
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,600
Lao Ji probably wants to use him

163
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,200
to lure out Wang Ping.

164
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,600
No.

165
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:03,960
Oh.

166
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,840
These brothers

167
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,800
aren't good people.

168
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,600
Both have long criminal records.

169
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,800
Could it be

170
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,400
Lao Ji startled them this time

171
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,320
and got

172
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,840
That shouldn't happen.

173
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,160
In broad daylight,

174
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:18,720
committing a crime on the street.

175
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,720
I just checked inside and outside the car.

176
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:22,560
Looked around.

177
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,440
Everything was tidy.

178
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,000
So when Lao Ji left,

179
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,000
he wasn't forced.

180
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:26,840
Also,

181
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,880
there's a supermarket nearby.

182
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:28,960
Lots of people passing by.

183
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,280
No way it wouldn't draw attention.

184
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,000
I think there's only one possibility.

185
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,520
Lao Ji was tailing someone on foot.

186
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,560
His phone ran out of battery.

187
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,320
How could that be?

188
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,960
Lao Ji's a veteran detective.

189
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,000
He'd know if his phone had power.

190
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
He'd keep track of that.

191
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:46,560
Xiao Yu.

192
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:46,960
What do you think?

193
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,120
Captain Lu.

194
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,800
Lao Ji's phone signal

195
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,440
is currently in an urban village

196
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,000
in a rental apartment.

197
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,200
It hasn't moved at all.

198
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:54,920
Lao Ji's been restrained.

199
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:55,720
By whom?

200
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,720
The criminal brothers.

201
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,840
But that doesn't make sense.

202
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,240
Even if Wang Ping showed up,

203
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,600
Lao Ji wouldn't just

204
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,920
go off alone without a word.

205
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,360
That's what's strange.

206
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,680
No signs of a struggle in the car.

207
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,720
So it was someone he knew.

208
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,480
He must've left willingly.

209
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,480
Most likely,

210
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,480
someone involved in this case.

211
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:14,480
Qilu.

212
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,480
Let's go find Lao Ji.

213
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,560
Minmin, Li Ya.

214
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,240
You two head back to the station.

215
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:17,920
Check again.

216
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:18,680
Xiao Yu.

217
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,120
Call for backup.
