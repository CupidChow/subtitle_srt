1
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,320
Officer,

2
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,400
Is there anything else you need?

3
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,440
Heh heh heh.

4
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,600
Hey, hey, hey.

5
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,160
What exactly are you doing here?

6
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:52,680
Do you usually

7
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,400
work in this area?

8
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,240
Yeah.

9
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,400
And this computer

10
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,000
never changes location?

11
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:57,840
My computer

12
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,160
rarely leaves this spot.

13
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,520
It's always right here.

14
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,320
Your computer—

15
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,680
I need to take it back for inspection.

16
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,480
There's a good chance

17
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,280
it's already infected with spyware.

18
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:07,720
Minmin,

19
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,120
handle the paperwork for him.

20
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,600
I'm still revising the script.

21
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,600
Please return it quickly.

22
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,640
My boss is urging me.

23
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:16,520
Lieutenant Lu,

24
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,080
All right.

25
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,400
The spyware in this computer

26
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,200
is the same program

27
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,840
that Gao Zhixiang purchased.

28
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,560
Now both cases are connected.

29
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,840
We finally have a lead again.

30
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,040
I traced the spyware

31
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,680
and found the controlling computer

32
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,960
is near the hotel,

33
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,320
or maybe inside.

34
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,120
The person who secretly filmed this video

35
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,200
didn't choose

36
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:17,600
to blackmail,

37
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,760
but exposed it directly.

38
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,680
That means

39
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,680
they were likely seeking revenge.

40
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,160
Most likely, it's someone from the crew.

41
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,360
Chen Minmin,

42
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,360
come with me again tomorrow.

43
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,360
Nice.

44
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,360
It's fine.

45
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,560
I get the general idea.

46
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,000
Thanks.

47
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,560
No problem.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,280
Lieutenant Lu,

49
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,360
I've asked around.

50
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,640
They all said

51
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,400
no one in the crew

52
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,880
has had any real conflict with the director.

53
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,800
It's all just normal work interactions.

54
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,240
What are you even doing?

55
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,160
My false eyelashes—

56
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,560
Don't you know they should be mink?

57
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,280
What did you stick on me?

58
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,880
I must've left my brain at home.

59
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,440
Sorry.

60
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:52,880
Jiaying,

61
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,560
I grabbed the wrong ones by accident.

62
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,680
I'll change them for you right now.

63
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,360
I'm doomed.

64
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,280
You've changed them over and over.

65
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,400
It's bad for your skin.

66
00:03:59,400 --> 00:03:59,800
Don't you know that?

67
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,080
I've spent so much on this face.

68
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,000
Are you trying to ruin me on purpose?

69
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,280
I used to really like her.

70
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,560
All right, that's enough.

71
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,840
Don't bother arguing with her.

72
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,960
Our darling is so beautiful.

73
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,120
Don't let this kind of thing

74
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,240
make you angry and get wrinkles.

75
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,000
Xuanxuan, tell me—

76
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,120
was she doing it on purpose?

77
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,120
Enough, enough.

78
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,640
You've already scolded her.

79
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,800
Just let it go.

80
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,560
It has to be Li Xuanxuan.

81
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,560
She seems so close to Yang Jiaying,

82
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,400
but she's two-faced.

83
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,400
Let's go.

84
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,080
Don't get yelled at again.

85
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:42,560
Hey, man—

86
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,120
We're from the city police.

87
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,000
We've already spoken to your director.

88
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:46,840
Don't be nervous.

89
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,360
I just have a few questions.

90
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,240
Li Xuanxuan is your

91
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,280
second female lead, right?

92
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,120
Yes.

93
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,240
She's our second female lead.

94
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,960
You mentioned something earlier—

95
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,520
two-faced,

96
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,360
acting differently behind people's backs.

97
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,280
What's that about?

98
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,800
Here's what happened.

99
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,960
Once, during a break,

100
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,520
she forgot to turn off her mic.

101
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,800
I heard

102
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,400
her

103
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,840
secretly insulting Yang Jiaying.

104
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,360
She said

105
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,360
she relied on

106
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,520
you know what

107
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,840
to get the lead actress role.

108
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,680
She also said

109
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,000
our director

110
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,080
has no taste.

111
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,280
Please don't tell our boss.

112
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:27,960
Don't worry.

113
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,560
I won't.

114
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:29,640
Thanks for your help.

115
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:29,960
Go ahead.

116
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,000
We targeted the wrong person from the start.

117
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,000
The one who secretly filmed the footage—

118
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:41,760
that person—

119
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,120
never aimed for the director.

120
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,880
It was Yang Jiaying.

121
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,280
If that's the case,

122
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,080
why was the director's computer

123
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,120
the one with spyware installed?

124
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,200
Then we need to ask Li Xuanxuan.

125
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,760
Go ahead, explain.

126
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,400
You put spyware on

127
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,440
the director's computer.

128
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,960
Used the webcam

129
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,640
to secretly record the director

130
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,880
and Yang Jiaying together.

131
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,520
Then posted it online.

132
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,000
Was it you?

133
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,840
Officer,

134
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,280
don't accuse me.

135
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,680
I don't know how to do that.

136
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,120
We already found the spyware

137
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,080
controller on your computer.

138
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,960
Yang Jiaying and that director—

139
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,080
they're both awful people.

140
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,400
She always gets her way

141
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,320
to become the lead actress.

142
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,760
I work hard to improve my acting,

143
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,320
but I'm always the second female lead.

144
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,400
Just her supporting role.

145
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,320
Why?

146
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,520
Then why did you

147
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,400
install spyware

148
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,200
on the director's computer?

149
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,520
The director is extremely cautious.

150
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,440
He's afraid of being secretly filmed.

151
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,520
He never goes to actresses' rooms.

152
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,680
He always calls them to his own room.

153
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,640
Same with Yang Jiaying.

154
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,560
So if I wanted proof,

155
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,520
I had to target him.

156
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:55,880
Let me ask you—

157
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,640
where did you get

158
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,680
the spyware?

159
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,280
I bought it.

160
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,520
Gao Zhixiang.

161
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,520
The software used in the crime

162
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,680
is the same as Li Xuanxuan's.

163
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,640
Both were bought here.

164
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,000
Seems like it's a membership system.

165
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,640
Game

166
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,840
has started.

167
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,400
Hiding your IP, right?

168
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Attacking firewalls, huh?

169
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:56,960
Even masking your tracks.

170
00:07:59,200 --> 00:07:59,560
Come on!

171
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,760
Who's afraid now?

172
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:05,560
Whoa.

173
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,200
Lieutenant Lu,

174
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,440
I've found his IP address.

175
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,440
This is what a real hacker

176
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,400
should do.

177
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,440
In the next moment,

178
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,440
all my traces

179
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,520
will vanish from the web.

180
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,000
You'll never find me.

181
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,640
And don't even think

182
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,880
about finding any evidence.

183
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,560
Hahaha!

184
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,440
Don't move!

185
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,120
Hands behind your back!

186
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:53,640
Don't move!

187
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,680
Hands behind your back!

188
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:56,680
Don't move!

189
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,280
Squat down!

190
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:58,760
Squat down!

191
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,880
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

192
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:00,520
Don't shoot!

193
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,200
Don't shoot!

194
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,320
Don't shoot!

195
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,320
Don't shoot!

196
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,520
Cai Shiqi.

197
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,000
I'll call you Cai Tian.

198
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,520
You're quite the genius.

199
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,440
Why use your talent

200
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,120
for things like this?

201
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:25,880
Shh.

202
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,520
I'm not here for your lecture.

203
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,080
What I do

204
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,760
is my own business.

205
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,880
You really think

206
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,280
beating me once

207
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,080
gives you the right to judge me?

208
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,000
And,

209
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,560
who says

210
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,440
talent must be used a certain way?

211
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,680
In the online world,

212
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,080
I do whatever

213
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,000
I want.

214
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:46,480
Fine.

215
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,040
I just want to know now—

216
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,720
why did you kill?

217
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,880
He used my tech

218
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,640
and left so many clues.

219
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
A useless fool like that

220
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,280
shouldn't exist in this world.

221
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,920
If not for that fool,

222
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,120
none of you

223
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,400
could ever catch me.

224
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,040
Cai Tian,

225
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,920
this is murder.

226
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,760
As long as I have a computer,

227
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,400
I'm a god.

228
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,000
Everyone's information

229
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,880
is laid bare before me.

230
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,880
Gao Zhixiang had epilepsy.

231
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,600
Once I knew his weakness,

232
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,520
killing him

233
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,040
was effortless.

234
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:28,760
Maybe.

235
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,520
With a computer,

236
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,000
you're a genius.

237
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,160
But without one,

238
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,640
you're just an ordinary person.

239
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,000
In prison,

240
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,160
there's no mouse or keyboard.

241
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:37,880
Let's see if you

242
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,880
still act so cocky.

243
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,400
It's fine.

244
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,160
I'm just saying,

245
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,240
today's commendation ceremony—

246
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,280
the setup,

247
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,120
the scale—

248
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,120
Wait, Xiaoyu.

249
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,640
Back to the point.

250
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,640
This time,

251
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,360
we managed to solve

252
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,000
the cyber intrusion case,

253
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,920
and successfully arrest Cai Shiqi.

254
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,360
Comrade Zhao Zhenyu

255
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,360
deserves much credit.

256
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,040
That's right.

257
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,480
Don't underestimate Xiaoyu—

258
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,360
he's usually so shy,

259
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,480
but he spoke in front of everyone.

260
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,000
He really is

261
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,760
strong and unstoppable!

262
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,360
Seriously.

263
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,120
Let's not just talk about Xiaoyu.

264
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,640
Lieutenant Lu tonight

265
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,360
should treat us

266
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,520
to something nice, right?

267
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,480
Stewed goose in an iron pot!

268
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:22,800
I don't want goose.

269
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,760
Seafood feast!

270
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,400
That's great!

271
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,720
Seafood feast!

272
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,240
Seafood feast!

273
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,760
Seafood feast!

274
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,120
Alright.

275
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,160
I'll treat you.

276
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,480
So here's the plan:

277
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,640
Get yourselves ready.

278
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,040
I'll wait at the third place left of the intersection.

279
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,800
Got it!

280
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,520
Hey—

281
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,240
Isn't that Lanzhou noodles?

282
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,040
Lieutenant Lu!

283
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,520
What about my seafood feast?

284
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,840
Why are we having Lanzhou noodles again?

285
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,000
Noodles are pretty good too.

286
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,240
Noodles are pretty good too.

287
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,760
Seafood is all just shells anyway.

288
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,400
That seafood...
