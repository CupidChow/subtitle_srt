1
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:17,960
Script

2
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,520
But wasn't the script already

3
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,760
destroyed by Zhao Wu and the others?

4
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:21,880
Don't forget,

5
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,400
Qian Junjie is the writer.

6
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,760
With such a perfect work,

7
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,000
how could he bear to destroy it?

8
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,440
Even if it was destroyed,

9
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,000
we can still recover the data.

10
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,000
Do you know what this is?

11
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,520
We restored your computer data.

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,320
The content of this document

13
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,640
matches the crime

14
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,000
exactly.

15
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:50,880
You...

16
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,120
What does that prove?

17
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,120
I just based it on

18
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,080
my two kidnapping experiences

19
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,080
and wrote a novel.

20
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,520
Just some artistic creation.

21
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,400
You police investigating cases,

22
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,440
are you really going to use a novel

23
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,440
as evidence?

24
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,280
Qian Junjie.

25
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,200
Do you think you can fool us cops?

26
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,760
The creation date of the file

27
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,640
can be traced.

28
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,760
A year ago,

29
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,840
you wrote this script.

30
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,520
That means,

31
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,840
before the kidnapping happened,

32
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,200
you already knew what would happen.

33
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,080
Don't tell me

34
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,440
you can predict the future.

35
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,120
Hahaha.

36
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,040
Hahaha.

37
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,720
Hahahahaha.

38
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,480
Hahaha.

39
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,640
I want to see Chen Minmin.

40
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,440
Why did you do this?

41
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,080
Because I hate Sheng Xiaole.

42
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,080
What gives you the right?

43
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,400
Minmin.

44
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:01,880
You...

45
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,000
Me...

46
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,640
Sheng Xiaole.

47
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,200
The three of us grew up together.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,600
You know,

49
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,040
my dad always thought I was useless.

50
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,520
He liked Sheng Xiaole,

51
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,520
the "perfect kid from next door."

52
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,400
At first,

53
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,000
I thought I just wasn't good enough.

54
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,480
I didn't meet his expectations.

55
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,800
But guess what?

56
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,920
Guess what I found out?

57
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:26,760
Tell me.

58
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,720
I found out

59
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,880
that sanctimonious old man

60
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,280
was having an affair with Sheng Xiaole's mom.

61
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,520
No wonder...

62
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,000
No wonder he liked Sheng Xiaole so much.

63
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,760
I've endured so much for years.

64
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,280
Should I just hand over everything

65
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,920
to that illegitimate child?

66
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,640
Why drag innocent Zhen Xiaoyu

67
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,040
into this?

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,920
According to my script,

69
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,000
she didn't have to die.

70
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,280
But I didn't expect her

71
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,760
to be so useless.

72
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,200
She couldn't go through with it.

73
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,920
If I couldn't destroy Sheng Xiaole

74
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,320
physically,

75
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,800
then I'd destroy him mentally.

76
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,400
I didn't expect

77
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,200
he'd be so mentally fragile.

78
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,760
In just two days,

79
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,440
he jumped to his death.

80
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,680
Don't you have anything else to ask?

81
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,880
Did you ever

82
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,400
really treat Xiaole as a friend?

83
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,440
I told him

84
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,760
I said I liked you.

85
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,760
But he insisted on competing with me.

86
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,960
He knew my dad meant a lot to me.

87
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,760
He was important.

88
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,640
But he still fought me for everything.

89
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,080
He tried to take everything

90
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,120
I had away from me.

91
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,280
If he didn't die,

92
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,120
who should have?

93
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,600
Qian Junjie.

94
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,960
Let me tell you,

95
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,360
in your life,

96
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,160
the most important person

97
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,400
is only yourself.

98
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,280
I've always treated Xiaole

99
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,760
like my own brother.

100
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,880
Since we were kids, I saw

101
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,160
how selfish and twisted you are.

102
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,360
Bullying,

103
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:02,720
hurting cats—

104
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,000
what haven't you done?

105
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,440
I didn't want Xiaole

106
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,400
to be close to you.

107
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,320
But he wouldn't listen.

108
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,440
He still saw you as

109
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,800
his best brother.

110
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,560
Minmin.

111
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,080
You're here.

112
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,120
How are you feeling?

113
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,080
Seeing you

114
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,760
makes me feel much better.

115
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,000
Sheng Xiaole's death—

116
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,920
did you have anything to do with it?

117
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,280
Sheng Xiaole, right?

118
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,920
He's still the most important, right?

119
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,200
Look at me now,

120
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,000
and you still care about him?

121
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,120
According to Zhao Wu and Long Ye's

122
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,200
statements,

123
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,720
Uncle Qian, at that time,

124
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,080
in his final moments,

125
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,920
was still thinking how to protect you.

126
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,480
Don't shoot.

127
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,440
Did he really love you as his son?

128
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,720
Don't you know that yourself?

129
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,440
Still fighting with yourself.

130
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,520
Come eat.

131
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,000
Minmin,

132
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,440
let's eat first.

133
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,280
As the saying goes,

134
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,600
people are iron,

135
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,560
food is steel.

136
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,040
Eat your fill first.

137
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,720
Get angry after you eat.

138
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:12,720
Right.

139
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,720
Captain Lu

140
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,440
specially brought you braised fish.

141
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,240
Xiao Yu

142
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,400
even picked out the bones for you.

143
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,840
Minmin,

144
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,520
in this life,

145
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,880
who doesn't have a few troubles?

146
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:48,560
Come on.

147
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,560
Eat first.

148
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,240
Let's eat.

149
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,120
Alright.

150
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,440
After we eat, we've got things to do.

151
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,520
Okay.

152
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,440
These scrambled eggs taste amazing.

153
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,360
Please, come inside.

154
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,720
We can handle it ourselves.

155
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,320
Alright.

156
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,880
The missing person is named Zhang Di.

157
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,000
His company said

158
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,400
they haven't reached him for three days.

159
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,360
Sister Ya.

160
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,640
Does he usually dislike cooking,

161
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,480
or is he away on a trip?

162
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,240
This matter—

163
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,600
Can't the local police handle it?

164
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,680
This person

165
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,080
is

166
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,280
a food safety investigator.

167
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,000
A million-follower influencer.

168
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,920
He's missed two days of livestreams.

169
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:19,880
No wonder.

170
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,080
That job makes enemies.

171
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,200
But this case

172
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,280
could be handled by the local police.

173
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:28,760
Okay.

174
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,120
Qi Lu.

175
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,200
We have to go ourselves.

176
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,680
Zhang Di's body was found.

177
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,120
What's wrong with you?

178
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,480
My neck problem flared up.

179
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,000
Did you find the missing person?

180
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,120
We found the body.

181
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,280
Just got back from the scene.

182
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,640
How did he die?

183
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,480
Thrown in water and drowned.

184
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,200
While still alive.

185
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,200
You two investigate this case.

186
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:54,920
We've got other things to do.

187
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,120
Hey, Captain Lu.

188
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,040
Give us a lead.

189
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,640
Execution-style killing.

190
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,120
Revenge killing.

191
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,280
Got it.

192
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,840
Half the case is solved.

193
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,760
What do you mean, half solved?

194
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,480
His words are just for reference.

195
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,000
We still have to start from scratch.

196
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,920
Investigate step by step.

197
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,400
I'll check.

198
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:10,920
Check.

199
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,680
I'll get the autopsy report for you.

200
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,280
Isn't the autopsy report here?

201
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:52,640
Sister Ya.

202
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,440
Three hundred thousand.

203
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:00,640
That short on money?

204
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,760
Loan shark.

205
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:03,920
That doesn't make sense.

206
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,520
Zhang Di is a million-follower influencer.

207
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,080
Let's collect evidence first.

208
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,520
Then we'll check out his company.

209
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,320
See if there's anything new.
