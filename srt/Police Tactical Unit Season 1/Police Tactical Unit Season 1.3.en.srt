1
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,240
Turns out I was right all along.

2
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,760
This isn't the first time Chen Yu

3
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,200
has stolen Fang Huihui's boyfriend.

4
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,440
Up to today,

5
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,240
you're only third on her list.

6
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,560
The one Chen Yu loves

7
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,120
is herself.

8
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,320
To be precise,

9
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,320
it's her possessiveness.

10
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,320
You guys are wrong.

11
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,120
Really.

12
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,920
She loves me.

13
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,320
Didn't she end up

14
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,320
marrying me after all?

15
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,680
As far as we know,

16
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,000
she didn't care

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,360
whether her legal husband lived or died.

18
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,560
If we hadn't stopped her,

19
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,760
she'd have fled abroad by now.

20
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,440
Plane ticket.

21
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,680
This possessiveness,

22
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,680
sometimes it's like

23
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,080
a monster.

24
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,000
Your so-called love for Chen Yu

25
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,080
means nothing before her giant monster.

26
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,120
Honestly,

27
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,320
it's not worth mentioning.

28
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,240
It's insignificant.

29
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,760
So you still don't want to talk?

30
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:40,680
I'll talk.

31
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,680
I knew it.

32
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,000
Zhang Nan is useless.

33
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,360
You guys move really fast.

34
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,560
I was supposed to be

35
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,520
in Australia tomorrow.

36
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,120
You hated Fang Huihui

37
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,000
so much you had to act,

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,680
to kill her.

39
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,560
I hated Fang Huihui.

40
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:56,920
Why?

41
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,760
She knew these men

42
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,880
weren't sincere with her,

43
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,000
yet she still stayed with them.

44
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,240
Before those men,

45
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:01,880
I was

46
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,880
her best friend.

47
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,680
She told me everything.

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,240
Since she started dating,

49
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,440
her whole mind

50
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:07,680
was filled with

51
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,000
men.

52
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,400
Men.

53
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:08,800
Men.

54
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,560
You killed her just for that?

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,760
I gave her chances.

56
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,440
Again and again.

57
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,240
I don't know

58
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,000
what you really felt

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,440
for Fang Huihui.

60
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,560
But even if you hurt her

61
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,560
again and again,

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,440
and stole her boyfriend,

63
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,640
before she died,

64
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,560
she still saw you as

65
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,320
her best friend.

66
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,680
I'm going to marry Zhang Nan.

67
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,000
Then I wish you both well.

68
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,000
Eat.

69
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,080
Sorry.

70
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,680
Her favorite food.

71
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,760
Fang Huihui trusted you

72
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,120
completely.

73
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,320
The drink you gave her,

74
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,760
she drank it without a thought.

75
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,120
Right?

76
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,880
It was even my favorite flavor.

77
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,320
You're so nice.

78
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,120
I found this at your place.

79
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,080
I think

80
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,120
you should take another look.

81
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,080
Xiao Yu.

82
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,000
This is my boyfriend, Zhang Nan.

83
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,320
This is my best friend.

84
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:58,680
Xiao Yu.

85
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,360
Nice weather today.

86
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,120
Let me ask them to take our photo.

87
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:02,880
Wait for me.

88
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,240
I'll be quick.

89
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,320
Come on.

90
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:09,640
Come.

91
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,480
What are you doing?

92
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,880
I was just thinking,

93
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,040
that friendship could

94
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,760
even become a reason to kill.

95
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,760
That's some truly extreme possessiveness.

96
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,040
Love blinds people.

97
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,640
I wonder after this case

98
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,880
if Zhang Nan will regret

99
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,640
giving up Fang Huihui, who loved him deeply,

100
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,400
and choosing Chen Yu, who never loved him.

101
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,880
Regret won't help now.

102
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,880
He couldn't tell right from wrong.

103
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:57,880
Minmin.

104
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:58,760
Take a look.

105
00:05:59,360 --> 00:05:59,840
Thanks.

106
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:00,880
Oh, right.

107
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,240
I sent you my delivery code.

108
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,520
Please pick it up for me.

109
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:04,720
Okay.

110
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,160
Xiao Chen,

111
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,880
be more careful.

112
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,880
I think Xiao Yu

113
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,400
really listens to you.

114
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,240
What do you have on him?

115
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,040
Let me be clear,

116
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,840
this isn't possessiveness.

117
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,840
Xiao Yu is public property.

118
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,840
I'm just

119
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,640
his spokesperson.

120
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,240
I think he's your

121
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,840
online assistant.

122
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,960
He

123
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,000
is a walking treasure chest.

124
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,000
Alright, enough chatting.

125
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,640
There's a new case.

126
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,240
Got it.

127
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:40,760
Old Ji.

128
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:41,880
Not going again?

129
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,240
I'm not done here yet.

130
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:44,880
You guys go.

131
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,600
Young people

132
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,240
should get out more.

133
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:46,640
Alright.

134
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:47,520
Coming over.

135
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,440
Be careful.

136
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,080
Hey.

137
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,320
This...

138
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,040
Mina,

139
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,360
Should we call the police?

140
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,320
Hello, honey.

141
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,480
My wallet and access card

142
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,320
are both missing.

143
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,360
I almost had to sleep on the street today.

144
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,080
Can you come back tomorrow morning?

145
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:34,800
Okay.

146
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,800
We'll change the lock when you're back.

147
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,480
Honey,

148
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,480
I'm home.

149
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:37,880
Captain Lu

150
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,320
The victim's name is Zhu Jin

151
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:39,880
Female

152
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,520
Twenty-six years old

153
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,840
Media company

154
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,480
Administrative manager

155
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,880
The person who reported is her boyfriend

156
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,520
Yang Shaoqi

157
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,760
He and the victim

158
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,320
were college classmates

159
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,400
are now preparing to get married

160
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,400
It's all messed up here

161
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:51,840
Burglary

162
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,240
And the person who reported?

163
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:54,960
Over there?

164
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,520
Captain Lu

165
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,880
It's now nine twenty

166
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,200
Time of death

167
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,480
was between six and eight hours ago

168
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,760
So the crime happened

169
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,080
between 1:00 and 3:30 a.m.

170
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,320
On the victim's side

171
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:10,920
Genital area is swollen

172
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,480
Multiple tears in the genital area

173
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,800
Possible sexual assault

174
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:21,640
At the same time

175
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,200
Face

176
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:22,720
Mouth and nose

177
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,640
both have abrasions

178
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,760
Severe marks on the neck

179
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,360
Broken hand bones

180
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,480
From what we see now, it should be

181
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,320
mechanical asphyxia

182
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,440
Multiple perpetrators

183
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,320
Whether strangled or suffocated

184
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,480
there was no second attempt

185
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,040
possible

186
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,320
I'll go to the surveillance room later

187
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,040
You and Li Ya

188
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:43,600
bring

189
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,560
Yang Shaoqi back to the station

190
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,440
and ask him more about the situation

191
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,320
Got it

192
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,320
Captain Lu

193
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,000
Then I'll go with the forensic doctor

194
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,800
to examine the body

195
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,320
You don't need to go

196
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,480
Just do a thorough canvass

197
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,560
Last time's decomposed body case

198
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,080
You still haven't recovered from it

199
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,200
Go ahead

200
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:10,880
Speak

201
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,440
Go to your surveillance room

202
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,080
Okay

203
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,160
Yang Shaoqi

204
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,920
We need you to calm down

205
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,920
and think back over these days

206
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,360
every word Zhu Jin said to you

207
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,320
Take your time

208
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,360
Every detail you remember

209
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,000
is important to us

210
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,840
It's a key clue

211
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,080
She called me and said

212
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,880
her wallet was missing

213
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,320
This wallet

214
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,960
is it related to the case?

215
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,040
Her wallet had an access card

216
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,760
Your cameras here

217
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,320
not a single one

218
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,280
is aimed at a key spot

219
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,720
It's obvious someone tampered with them

220
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,760
None of you noticed, right?

221
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,480
In our community

222
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,520
there are so many cameras

223
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,400
How could we watch them all?

224
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,160
Every patrol

225
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,200
When did you last check the footage?

226
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,520
I think it was

227
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,400
a week ago

228
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,520
Pull up the last half month's footage

229
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:38,720
Okay

230
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,400
Zhu Jin lost her wallet

231
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,080
When did that happen?

232
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:45,760
Yesterday

233
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,960
She was shopping at the mall yesterday

234
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,840
and found out after getting home

235
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,200
her access card was gone

236
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,280
She usually

237
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,760
is always very careful

238
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,600
Did she ever tell you

239
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,960
where at the mall it was stolen?

240
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:06,720
No

241
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,600
She told me

242
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,200
her access card

243
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,960
she'd just get a new one

244
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,880
I was on a business trip then

245
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:21,640
Then

246
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,160
I came back the next day

247
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,400
We'd change the lock then

248
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,280
Didn't expect this
