1
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,440
Morning.

2
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,560
Hey, hey, hey.

3
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,120
We're not open yet.

4
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,000
Come back tonight.

5
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,920
You're here to apply for security, right?

6
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,160
Yes.

7
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:31,920
I'm applying.

8
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:32,720
Come with me.

9
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,320
Ah.

10
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,680
How did this actress end up like this?

11
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,480
Can't recognize her at all.

12
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,440
Chasing perfection, I guess.

13
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,240
That was quick.

14
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,040
Come on, come on.

15
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,480
Sit down, hurry.

16
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,040
Traffic was a bit heavy.

17
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,040
Haven't had hotpot in ages.

18
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,800
All my favorite foods.

19
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,440
Come on.

20
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:47,800
Let's eat.

21
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,680
Let's get started.

22
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,120
Xiao Yu just messaged.

23
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,000
He said surveillance near Qianyang County

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,040
didn't spot Jin Weihua.

25
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,240
Not sure if

26
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,360
he's already left Qishan.

27
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,880
He didn't run off, did he?

28
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,440
No way.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Jin Weihua went back to Qianyang County

30
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,000
because his dad's not doing well.

31
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,920
He came back just to see him one last time.

32
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,240
He won't go far.

33
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:07,680
Qilu.

34
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,360
Report to Qianyang police

35
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,120
about the situation.

36
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,120
Ask them to help out.

37
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,800
Send some guys

38
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,240
to watch near Jin Weihua's house.

39
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,560
See if anyone suspicious shows up.

40
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,920
If so, grab them right away.

41
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,360
The nearby counties

42
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,320
and their entertainment venues

43
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:18,880
should be checked too.

44
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,920
Based on Jin Weihua's usual methods,

45
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,680
KTVs and foot massage parlors
must be prioritized.

46
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:24,560
Wait.

47
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,720
Can he still commit crimes now?

48
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,360
He definitely will.

49
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,360
Alright.

50
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,680
I'll go check it out.

51
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,120
Captain Lu.

52
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,240
This Jin Weihua

53
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,480
has been wanted for years.

54
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,720
How has he never been caught?

55
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:37,800
Yeah.

56
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,480
There's so much surveillance now.

57
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,440
Don't tell me there's not even one clear face shot.

58
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,240
And when we follow the leads,

59
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,120
no one has ever seen his face.

60
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,680
Could it be

61
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,680
he can turn invisible?

62
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:51,720
You...

63
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,040
What were you talking about just now?

64
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:54,920
Actress.

65
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,680
Actress.

66
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,120
No.

67
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,560
Later on...

68
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,240
Can't recognize.

69
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,120
Plastic surgery.

70
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,200
Oh.

71
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,360
No wonder they all say

72
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,240
they've never seen Jin Weihua.

73
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,440
If he had plastic surgery, it makes sense.

74
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,880
Li Ya, have Xiao Yu

75
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,720
check all the nearby

76
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,560
plastic surgery clinics.

77
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,720
Records from the past few years.

78
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:11,920
See if there's any

79
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,560
suspicious person.

80
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,600
That's a huge workload.

81
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,280
As for us,

82
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,200
before results come out,

83
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,800
let's stick to the original plan.

84
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,200
Check the nearby restaurants,

85
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:22,600
KTVs,

86
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,160
and small salons.

87
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,080
Focus on those.

88
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,280
Alright.

89
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,480
Drink up.

90
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:26,960
Let's wrap up early.

91
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:27,600
Got it.

92
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,200
Finish eating and get back to work.

93
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:28,600
Come on.

94
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,040
Eat.

95
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,640
I want that one.

96
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,280
Captain Ji, pass me those potato slices.

97
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:31,800
Sure.

98
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,280
Thanks.

99
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,720
There's meat, eat the meat.

100
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,720
Why are you saving money?

101
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,200
Eat up.

102
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:36,720
Come on, I'll go down.

103
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,160
This, this, this.

104
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,400
Qianyang County

105
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,280
Not many places offer hostess services.

106
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:51,440
Here.

107
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,160
Hui Du Guo Ji is the biggest one.

108
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,000
Okay.

109
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:55,760
Just this place.

110
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,000
Ya-jie.

111
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,880
Maybe you should think of another plan.

112
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,920
If anything goes wrong here,

113
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,160
Captain Lu will have my head.

114
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,520
I chose to come myself.

115
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,160
It's not your responsibility.

116
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,400
If you keep hesitating like this,

117
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,280
how will we catch Jin Weihua?

118
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,400
Alright.

119
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,400
Then I'll fully cooperate.

120
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,680
If there's any danger,

121
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,800
call for backup right away.

122
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,160
Don't worry.

123
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,440
If you upset the guests,

124
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,400
you won't have it easy either.

125
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,800
Got it, everyone?

126
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,320
Got it.

127
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:27,800
Understood.

128
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:28,760
Alright.

129
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:29,880
That's it, break it up.

130
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,040
Hey, hey, hey.

131
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,400
Sis, sis.

132
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,280
Come here, come here.

133
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,120
Mi-jie told me

134
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,160
to show you the ropes.

135
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,560
Don't worry.

136
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,560
Just learn from me.

137
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,640
But you know,

138
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,640
your outfit

139
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,640
really doesn't fit in here.

140
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,000
Look at what they're wearing.

141
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,520
You need to dress up more.

142
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,640
That's how guests remember you.

143
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,760
And you'll get more work.

144
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,640
Understand?

145
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,160
Sis.

146
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,640
But from what I see,

147
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,760
you've got the figure,

148
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,800
and the looks too.

149
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,120
You look like you belong in this job.

150
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,640
We all look like that.

151
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,520
You're so pretty,

152
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,280
you could marry a rich guy.

153
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,400
No problem at all.

154
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,760
Why work here then?

155
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,560
Competing with us for a living.

156
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,680
It's all because of my damn father.

157
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,240
He owes a ton of money.

158
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,640
He's always hiding everywhere.

159
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,800
How could I just watch him die?

160
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,280
If not for him,

161
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,760
I wouldn't be here.

162
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,160
You're you,

163
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,920
he's him.

164
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,400
Why drag yourself down with him?

165
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:30,880
Alright.

166
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,880
From now on,

167
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,640
we're sisters.

168
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,520
If anything comes up,

169
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,520
I've got your back.

170
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,640
You're new here,

171
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,400
if you don't understand something,

172
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,120
just ask me.

173
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,560
When I get a job,

174
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,440
I'll call you first.

175
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,680
Once you've made money,

176
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,040
leave this place as soon as you can.

177
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,400
Just like my friend did.

178
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,280
She vanished into thin air.

179
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:47,920
Now I'm stuck

180
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,880
with no one to talk to.

181
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,600
Drink up.

182
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,240
Go on, drink.

183
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,240
Have some more.

184
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,440
Drink.

185
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,240
Little sis.

186
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:58,520
Come.

187
00:05:59,080 --> 00:05:59,760
Have a drink with me.

188
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,400
Go away.

189
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,760
I'm not drinking.

190
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,760
Why not?

191
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,760
I took antibiotics today.

192
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,280
Antibiotics.

193
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,400
Why are you here?

194
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,440
Drink with me.

195
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:08,840
Hey.

196
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,920
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

197
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,240
Bro, bro.

198
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,080
She's like a block of wood.

199
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,080
Don't ask her to drink.

200
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:14,720
If you want to drink,

201
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,920
drink with me.

202
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,600
Then you drink.

203
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,560
I'll drink, I'll drink.

204
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:19,800
Bro.

205
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,720
You drink too.

206
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,360
You're the sensible one.

207
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,280
Right?

208
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,880
Drink with me more often.

209
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,280
Sure.

210
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,280
Thank you.

211
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:47,760
Hello, bosses.

212
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,160
What kind of service do you need?

213
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,280
Here at your place,

214
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,280
do you have

215
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,040
any girls?

216
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,680
Yes, we do.

217
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,160
Please wait a moment.

218
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,360
I'll arrange it for you right away.

219
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,160
Okay.

220
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:02,560
Sis,

221
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:03,680
Huamei,

222
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,480
why are you here?

223
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,720
Why are you still so uptight?

224
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,880
How can you work like this?

225
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,360
It's not that I'm uptight.

226
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,600
That old creep just now,

227
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,760
he spilled booze all over me.

228
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,480
Look at me.

229
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,760
I even changed my clothes.

230
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,240
I still feel

231
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:13,880
uncomfortable.

232
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,120
What are you really here for?

233
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,960
You've been here for days.

234
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:20,960
Never happy one day,

235
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,680
never willing the next.

236
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,040
You just wander around every day.

237
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,320
Look at you,

238
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,400
with such a great figure.

239
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,120
If you don't use it,

240
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,600
what a waste.

241
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,040
Right?

242
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,960
Be honest with me,

243
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,960
what are you really here for?

244
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,960
I'm actually here to find my man.

245
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,960
He dumped me.

246
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,320
He hooked up with a girl here.

247
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,520
This time I came

248
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,400
to catch him.

249
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,480
Sis,

250
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,240
you're so pretty.

251
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,320
He must be blind.

252
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,400
Let me show you his photo.

253
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,240
Let me see.

254
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,240
Sis,

255
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,240
You...

256
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:50,520
You...

257
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:50,960
You...

258
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,880
He's not much, honestly.

259
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,240
Maybe you shouldn't bother.

260
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,680
I'll find you some cute guys.

261
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,320
No.

262
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:56,840
Huamei,

263
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,680
I can't let him go.

264
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,600
I have to find him.

265
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,400
Can you help me, please?

266
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,120
Help me, Huamei.

267
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,760
Alright.

268
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,120
I'll tell

269
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,880
my girlfriends about this.

270
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,520
Let them look into it quietly.

271
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,840
So your man won't find out.

272
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:11,520
Otherwise,

273
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,160
he'll disappear again.

274
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:13,960
Oh, right.

275
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,240
On his arm,

276
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,360
he has a Tiger head tattoo.

277
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,200
Don't worry about that.

278
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,200
My girlfriends,

279
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,120
when it comes to catching cheaters,

280
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,400
they're better than detectives.

281
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,360
Alright.

282
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,120
Leave it to me.

283
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:25,920
Thank you.

284
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,240
Sweetie,

285
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:26,960
It's nothing.

286
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:27,560
Let's go.

287
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,000
Come on.

288
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,600
Say hi to the boss.

289
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,040
Welcome.

290
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,160
Good evening.

291
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:47,560
Alright.

292
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:48,920
Hey.

293
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,960
Just keep her.

294
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:51,560
The rest

295
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,280
can all leave.

296
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,280
Hey.

297
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,160
Bro,

298
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,000
we're friends.

299
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,000
Let's hang out together.

300
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,160
Come on, let's go.

301
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,440
Go, go, go.

302
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:00,880
Go on.

303
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,280
What's going on?

304
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:06,720
Tell me.

305
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,120
Isn't it obvious?

306
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,000
She's undercover.

307
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,160
Who did you report to?

308
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,720
Who let you act on your own?

309
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,280
What if something happens?

310
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,440
It's too dangerous.

311
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,160
Don't worry.

312
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,000
I've got it all set up.

313
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,880
There won't be any problems.

314
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,400
Your plan

315
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,680
is just Qilu backing you up?

316
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,680
Wait till I deal with him later.

317
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,400
It's not his fault.

318
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,280
I forced him.

319
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,280
Jin Weihua is so cunning.

320
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,120
He vanishes every day, never shows up.

321
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,960
If we don't take action soon,

322
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,160
what if another dismemberment case happens?

323
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,440
Forget it.

324
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:40,720
Li Ya

325
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,880
got inside here.

326
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,040
It wasn't easy.

327
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,400
Why don't we just

328
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,440
fully support her?

329
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,280
Maybe

330
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,760
she'll find a clue.

331
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,440
Besides,

332
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,040
Li Ya is usually

333
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,280
smart

334
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:51,920
and clever.

335
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,720
She can handle anything.

336
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,880
But she must stay safe.

337
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,480
If anything happens,

338
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,280
report to HQ immediately.

339
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,160
Don't just rush in alone.

340
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,040
Don't worry.

341
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:46,720
Li Ya,

342
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,360
last time you mentioned

343
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,120
Huamei's friend,

344
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:49,680
Mengjiao.

345
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,600
She didn't hook up with a rich guy.

346
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,680
She's missing.

347
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,160
Her family already reported it.

348
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,160
She's been missing for a long time.

349
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,600
Find her for me.

350
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,040
Alive or dead, I want her found.

351
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:58,440
Also,

352
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,720
keep your phone with you.

353
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,280
Hey, Li Ya,

354
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,000
Xiaoyu tracked your signal.

355
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,120
If anything happens there,

356
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,800
report to us anytime.

357
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,040
Plainclothes are stationed outside.

358
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:04,920
Ready to assist at any time.

359
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,480
Hi, Sister Ya.

360
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,600
The person you're looking for,

361
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,360
I asked around for you.

362
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,240
The girls all said they haven't seen him.

363
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,360
But someone with a tiger head tattoo
on his arm—

364
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,800
I think there's one in our club.

365
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,160
What was it again?

366
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,600
He suddenly touched you.

367
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,600
And even bit—

368
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,280
—his arm.

369
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,280
Bit hard enough to draw blood.

370
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,160
Just saw the tattoo.

371
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,080
But not sure if it's a tiger head.

372
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,080
Brother Zhang,

373
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,160
You guys go ahead and drink.

374
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:39,680
Sis,

375
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,440
The one with the tattoo on his arm—

376
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,480
That's Security Guard Lao Wang.

377
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,880
And I think he's on shift today.
