1
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,120
Old Four is watching the car.

2
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,800
If that's the case,

3
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,680
then it's Zhao Keyuan.

4
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:29,560
That makes sense.

5
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,160
This guy

6
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,280
is Er Gou's right-hand man.

7
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,720
He's in charge of contacting Zhao Keyuan.

8
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,880
If we follow his lead,

9
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:35,520
and investigate,

10
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,280
we'll definitely find Zhao Keyuan.

11
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,040
Bro,

12
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,280
let's talk.

13
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,200
If it weren't for us,

14
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,200
you'd be dead by now.

15
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,040
The woman Er Gou met—

16
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,640
was it Zhao Keyuan?

17
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:45,520
Everyone,

18
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,480
hold on a second.

19
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,880
Your acting is pretty good.

20
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:48,880
I

21
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,520
can I take another look

22
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,360
at your police badges?

23
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,240
Put them all down.

24
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,320
Put them down.

25
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,000
According to The Rat,

26
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,360
Er Gou's previous supplier

27
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,640
was taken down by the Narcotics Division.

28
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:09,800
Now he's worried

29
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,600
about not having a supply channel.

30
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,640
Coincidentally, his men filmed

31
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,800
Fool being sent to the hospital

32
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,680
for emergency treatment.

33
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:15,960
He wants to use this

34
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,720
to keep Zhao Keyuan

35
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,360
tied to Rongcheng.

36
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,080
He wants to replace Zhao Keyuan.

37
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:19,560
No.

38
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,480
According to Narcotics Division intel,

39
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,640
the real boss behind Zhao Keyuan

40
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,600
is called Lakun.

41
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,760
He's very suspicious by nature,

42
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,280
hard to approach.

43
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,840
Er Gou used to be

44
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,200
a trusted aide of Lakun's archrival.

45
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,000
So,

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,120
it's hard for him to replace Zhao Keyuan.

47
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,400
He just wants to turn Zhao Keyuan

48
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,400
into his own puppet.

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,400
A puppet.

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,320
Right.

51
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,920
This Er Gou

52
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,040
never shows his face.

53
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,400
But he has plenty of informants

54
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,120
under him.

55
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,760
Fool

56
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,480
is helping

57
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,560
Zhao Keyuan with her work—

58
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,480
he probably knows about it.

59
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:46,640
Lakun

60
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,720
is extremely suspicious,

61
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,280
and ruthless.

62
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,720
If the video of Fool still being alive

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,920
gets to Lakun,

64
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:52,760
no doubt,

65
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,560
Zhao Keyuan won't survive.

66
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,920
He's counting on that,

67
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,360
so he believes

68
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,760
he can control Zhao Keyuan.

69
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,200
That way,

70
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,200
he doesn't have to try

71
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,400
to earn Lakun's trust,

72
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,280
and can make Zhao Keyuan his scapegoat.

73
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,640
It's a win-win for him.

74
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,280
Not necessarily.

75
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,640
This Er Gou

76
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,280
only knows from his informants

77
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,640
that

78
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,200
Fool is Zhao Keyuan's trusted aide.

79
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,000
Keeping Fool alive

80
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:15,760
so

81
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,760
Zhao Keyuan will surely obey him.

82
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,560
And supply him.

83
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,560
But what he can't see is

84
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,200
Zhao Keyuan cares about Fool.

85
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:24,760
So,

86
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,640
I think

87
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,400
the news that Fool is alive

88
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,200
if Zhao Keyuan finds out,

89
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,840
it might not be a bad thing.

90
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,280
Why did Er Gou buy condoms?

91
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,680
These two have always been enemies.

92
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,400
He was suppressed for years,

93
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,960
now he finally turned the tables.

94
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,960
He's got Zhao Keyuan under control.

95
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,520
Of course he's getting cocky.

96
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,000
If you ask me, he did it on purpose.

97
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,520
It's just a man's pride.

98
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,560
He just wants to

99
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,840
show off in front of Zhao Keyuan.

100
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:48,600
But he didn't expect

101
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,560
to meet a tough opponent.

102
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:49,960
And lost his life.

103
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,880
As for The Rat,

104
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,280
he has his own scheme.

105
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,400
He knew Zhao Keyuan and Er Gou

106
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,320
were meeting that day.

107
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,400
So he hid behind a tree to watch.

108
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,160
If everything went

109
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,680
according to Er Gou's plan,

110
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,120
he could keep enjoying the good life

111
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:03,680
with them.

112
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:04,560
But

113
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,280
if something happened to Er Gou,

114
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,280
he'd have a video

115
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,240
as leverage to save himself.

116
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,280
Also,

117
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:10,880
he said

118
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,400
the people we met at the parking lot

119
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,840
were Zhao Keyuan's people.

120
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,360
Oh.

121
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,800
So now Zhao Keyuan

122
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,120
has only two options.

123
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,600
Either look for The Rat,

124
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,560
or

125
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,800
look for Fool.

126
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,000
Captain Lu,

127
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,400
what should we do next?

128
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,440
Next,

129
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,080
ah,

130
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:36,880
let's take a gamble.

131
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,280
Chief Shi,

132
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,080
I let Zhao Keyuan escape last time—

133
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,960
that was my mistake.

134
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,960
Please trust me this time.

135
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,960
This plan of yours

136
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,800
is way too risky.

137
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,880
If we alert her,

138
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,800
catching her again

139
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,720
will be much harder.

140
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,800
But right now, we don't have

141
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,800
any other options.

142
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,960
If we don't act now,

143
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,000
if she escapes again,

144
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,240
when will we ever catch her?

145
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,840
This Zhao Keyuan

146
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,160
slipped away right under my nose

147
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,720
and stayed in Rongcheng for three months.

148
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,720
No one noticed.

149
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,280
This time,

150
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,120
I'll bring her back for sure.

151
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:16,880
Alright.

152
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,560
If you fail to catch Zhao Keyuan again,

153
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,320
you as Captain

154
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,000
can go home and grow flowers.

155
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,000
Yes.

156
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,840
Can we trust Zhao Keyuan?

157
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,560
This is obviously a trap.

158
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:42,760
She will.

159
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,000
At least,

160
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,200
she wants to believe it herself.

161
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,760
Ever since Zhao Keyuan

162
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,080
was threatened by The Rat,

163
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,200
she never once

164
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,640
asked about Fool's whereabouts.

165
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,440
She just sent people to search everywhere.

166
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,440
The Rat and Er Gou—

167
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,440
she even killed Er Gou right away.

168
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,080
If it were me,

169
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,080
trying to survive,

170
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,440
I'd find Fool first

171
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,400
and then

172
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,320
wipe out all threats.

173
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,560
That's true.

174
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,840
And think about it—

175
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,440
if Fool is really alive,

176
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,400
and placed by our police

177
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,520
in some hospital,

178
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:09,880
then finding Fool

179
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,200
is much easier than finding Er Gou.

180
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,120
Someone as smart as Zhao Keyuan

181
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,880
wouldn't miss that.

182
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,120
Women really do understand women better.

183
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,640
All signs show

184
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,720
Zhao Keyuan doesn't want

185
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,880
the news that Fool is alive

186
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,760
to reach Lakun.

187
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,520
Zhao Keyuan wants to protect Fool.

188
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,880
Since Zhao Keyuan chose to protect Fool,

189
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,320
it means she believes

190
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,720
Fool is still alive.

191
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,320
So she'll definitely believe this message.

192
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,440
Let's gather.

193
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,520
Everyone, move out.

194
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,200
It's you.

195
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,520
Since we parted at the hospital,

196
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,880
it's been a long time, hasn't it?

197
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,080
So that means

198
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,200
The Rat was caught by you.

199
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,200
You're the one who asked me here today.

200
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,080
About Fool's gunshot last time—

201
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,080
I haven't settled that with you yet.

202
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,520
But you came to me first.

203
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,320
That shot Fool took

204
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,560
was for you.

205
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,640
You know that yourself.

206
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,080
When we caught The Rat,

207
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,320
you must've guessed it already.

208
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,400
So I used

209
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,520
The Rat's phone to send you

210
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,880
the invitation to meet.

211
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,440
Honestly,

212
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,760
I wasn't sure myself.

213
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,520
After all,

214
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,440
someone as cunning as you

215
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,520
wouldn't fall for it so easily.

216
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,120
But then I thought,

217
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,080
what if

218
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,440
you wanted to fall for it?

219
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,720
Then anything could happen.

220
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,960
So the text Fool sent me

221
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,320
was your doing too.

222
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,200
Yes.

223
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,400
I guess

224
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,440
when you learned from The Rat

225
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,080
that Fool was still alive,

226
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,080
you must've made up your mind

227
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,120
to protect Fool this time.

228
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,520
But you also know

229
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,120
the best way to protect Fool

230
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,080
is

231
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,760
to stay away from him.

232
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,880
So I pretended to be Fool

233
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,640
and sent you a message

234
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,760
inviting you to meet.

235
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,320
I guessed

236
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,640
you wouldn't come.

237
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,960
But you also know

238
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,200
the last thing you must do for Fool

239
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,080
is to kill The Rat.

240
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,400
That way, Lakun

241
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,960
won't learn Fool is still alive.

242
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,120
In this world,

243
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,400
no one can threaten

244
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,280
Fool's safety anymore.

245
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,280
Right?

246
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,320
What I didn't expect

247
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,320
is that a selfish, cold woman like you

248
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,960
would do so much for Fool.

249
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,720
Fool—

250
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,280
is he healed?

251
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,640
After Fool was shot that day,

252
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,960
he was rushed to the ER.

253
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,320
At the end,

254
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,720
he held my hand and told me

255
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,520
asked if I could let you go.

256
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,760
But sadly,

257
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,640
his injuries were too severe.

258
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,000
He didn't make it.

259
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:42,720
Oh!

260
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,520
That's why they say,

261
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,880
it has to be our Mobile Unit.

262
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,080
Over at the Narcotics Division,

263
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,520
using Zhao Keyuan's intel,

264
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,440
they uprooted Lakun's entire base.

265
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,080
His overseas drug network

266
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,440
was completely destroyed.

267
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,440
Hey,

268
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,240
wait a minute.

269
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,440
Why is everyone today

270
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,320
looking so out of energy?

271
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,160
Hey,

272
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,360
even Chen Minmin seems tired.

273
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,080
Aren't you usually

274
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,680
the one who's always so chatty?

275
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,600
Where did all that endless energy

276
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,560
of yours go?

277
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,360
Hey, hey, hey!

278
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,480
Old Ji,

279
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,160
you're finally back.

280
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,920
What's up with your Mobile Unit

281
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,960
today?

282
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,440
Chief Shi,

283
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,560
you're here to share good news, right?

284
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,320
That's right.

285
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,080
But this good news,

286
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,720
I almost wish I didn't have to share it.

287
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,440
Of course good news should be shared.

288
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,320
But you know,

289
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,720
good news

290
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,440
depends on where you announce it.

291
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,040
With everyone here,

292
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:34,960
am I right?

293
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,720
That's right.

294
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,200
Now I get it.

295
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,480
You were all waiting for me here.

296
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:47,960
Alright.

297
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,720
It's about time to get off work.

298
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,960
I wonder,

299
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,040
if we announce the good news

300
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,720
at a hotpot restaurant,

301
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,040
would anyone be up for it?

302
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,320
Count me in!

303
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:58,600
Chief Shi,

304
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,440
I know a really great hotpot place.

305
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,440
You're just so cool,

306
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,320
seriously, you're the coolest.

307
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,080
Seafood works too.
