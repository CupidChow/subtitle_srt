1
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,080
We're currently tracking a drug dealer.

2
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,640
We traced one of his associates.

3
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,360
He died three days ago.

4
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,480
His situation

5
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,080
is very similar to the case

6
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,080
you've been investigating lately.

7
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,120
One of his mistresses

8
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,880
is also named Zhao Keyuan.

9
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,640
Zhao Keyuan.

10
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,760
And that associate

11
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,880
kept two other mistresses.

12
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,480
Both of them are dead too.

13
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,920
Only Zhao Keyuan is still alive.

14
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,600
Alright, alright.

15
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,080
Got it.

16
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,200
Okay.

17
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,120
I'll treat you to dinner next time.

18
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,080
Alright, alright.

19
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,240
Mm.

20
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,080
What's wrong?

21
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,080
This Zhao Keyuan—

22
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,600
We really need to investigate her.

23
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,520
Where did Chen Minmin go?

24
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,080
After we left the hospital,

25
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,800
we split up.

26
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,960
Xiaoyu said

27
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,400
she hasn't

28
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,240
been in the office today either.

29
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:54,800
Where did the girl go?

30
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,480
What did you talk about at the end today?

31
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,760
At the end,

32
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,080
we discussed where the murder weapon was.

33
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,200
Then I told her

34
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,080
to wait until the scene was processed

35
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,920
and then go back to look for it.

36
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:05,960
Huiyingju.

37
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,600
Check the surveillance.

38
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,280
Who are you?

39
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,640
How did you find this place?

40
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,520
I'm a police officer.

41
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,280
So you're here

42
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,560
for the girl?

43
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,080
The girl?

44
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:49,960
Who?

45
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,080
Zhao Keyuan.

46
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,240
That's not her name.

47
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,480
She's a poor soul.

48
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,400
She has no name.

49
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,920
So what's your relationship

50
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,160
with the girl?

51
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,160
We

52
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,920
have been together since long ago.

53
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,280
She calls me Fool.

54
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,360
I call her girl.

55
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,160
Fool promised the girl since childhood

56
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,160
to take her to the city.

57
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,160
To give her a good life.

58
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,280
But unexpectedly,

59
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,280
it was the girl

60
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,040
who brought Fool to the city.

61
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,080
By enduring beatings,

62
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,960
she let Fool live in a big house.

63
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:16,920
So are you willing

64
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,360
to watch the girl get beaten?

65
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,720
I don't want to.

66
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,280
So that day,

67
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,040
you saw everything?

68
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:23,800
I—

69
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,160
I didn't just see it.

70
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,600
You killed Wang Liuxi.

71
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,400
I don't know his name.

72
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,920
I only know

73
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,520
since the girl was with him,

74
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,840
she suffered a lot.

75
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:34,920
That day,

76
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,040
he looked crazy.

77
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,920
He wouldn't let the girl live.

78
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:38,840
So I—

79
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,160
I just—

80
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,240
hit him once.

81
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,800
What did you use to hit him?

82
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:43,800
With a—

83
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:44,920
hammer.

84
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,040
Where's the hammer?

85
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:46,960
The hammer—

86
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,280
It's right here.

87
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,040
So would you

88
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,080
use it on me?

89
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,040
No, no.

90
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,920
You never hurt the girl.

91
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,960
Why did only Minmin go in

92
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,720
and not come out?

93
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,800
When we went in,

94
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,600
we didn't see Minmin.

95
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,040
Sir,

96
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,600
can you rewind a bit?

97
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,520
Check if anyone entered

98
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,600
before Minmin went in.

99
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,080
Who is this person?

100
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,720
So what are you going to do?

101
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,840
I'm a police officer.

102
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,160
I'm going to save the girl.

103
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:21,840
Save her?

104
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:22,920
How?

105
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:27,680
Fool.

106
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:28,600
Fool.

107
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,920
Fool, I promise you—

108
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,280
I'll take you to find the girl.

109
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,240
Fool.

110
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,160
Darn it.

111
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,280
Minmin is in danger.

112
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:35,920
Qilu,

113
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,040
go back to the villa and save Minmin.

114
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:37,960
Li Ya and I will chase this person.

115
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:38,480
Let's go.

116
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,360
Minmin!

117
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,480
Minmin!

118
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:53,920
Minmin!

119
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,240
Brother Qilu!

120
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:55,840
Brother Qilu!

121
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:56,680
You're here.

122
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,360
Zhao Keyuan didn't kill Wang Liuxi.

123
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,600
It was the one who tied me up.

124
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,400
His name is Fool.

125
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,960
The murder weapon is this hammer.

126
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,280
Notify Captain Lu right away.

127
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,400
He's already gone to the hospital

128
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,080
to save Zhao Keyuan.

129
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:05,920
Let's get out first.

130
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,160
No.

131
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,240
I have those

132
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:07,800
gloves in my bag.

133
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,600
Take the evidence.

134
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:08,960
Okay.

135
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,240
Let's go.

136
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:13,920
Let's go.

137
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,160
Captain Lu

138
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:20,920
We've found Minmin.

139
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,400
She's safe.

140
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,920
The one who attacked her is Fool.

141
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,280
He and Zhao Keyuan grew up together.

142
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,840
He's also the real killer of Wang Liuxi.

143
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,040
The weapon was a hammer.

144
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:27,720
It's been found.

145
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,920
He's heading to the hospital now.

146
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,480
To save Zhao Keyuan.

147
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,400
Call for backup, quick!

148
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,160
Okay.

149
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,480
What's wrong?

150
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:33,800
Minmin's been found.

151
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,280
Let's go back to the hospital first.

152
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,080
We'll talk about the rest on the way.

153
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,840
Changing dressings, making rounds.

154
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,200
Don't come any closer.

155
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,200
Don't move.

156
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,280
Let's put the knife down first.

157
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:52,720
Don't do anything rash.

158
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,640
If you really hurt someone,

159
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,960
you'll never see the girl again.

160
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,640
Put the gun down.

161
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,200
Fool.

162
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:56,800
We can help you.

163
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,280
Fool.

164
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,200
Fool.

165
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:58,640
Don't do this.

166
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,480
Captain Lu.

167
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,280
Don't be nervous.

168
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,200
Fool won't do anything crazy.

169
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,480
Clear out everyone not involved from the hall.

170
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,040
Stop talking nonsense.

171
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:06,840
Where's the girl?

172
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,080
Take me to see the girl.

173
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:08,400
Qilu.

174
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,320
Clear the people.

175
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,520
Leave the medical staff.

176
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,480
Disperse.

177
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:11,720
Everyone, leave.

178
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,600
Stop staring.

179
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,200
Medical staff stay.

180
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:13,600
Fool.

181
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,040
Go prepare supplies.

182
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,600
Fool, look at me.

183
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,320
This is our Captain Lu.

184
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,280
Go back, go back.

185
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:18,960
Your case—

186
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,960
He has the final say.

187
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,600
Just tell him what you told me

188
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,960
one more time, that's all.

189
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,280
In here,

190
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:24,760
there really

191
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,400
isn't Zhao Keyuan involved.

192
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,280
Nothing, right?

193
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:27,520
Right?

194
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:29,600
Don't worry.

195
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,160
Once you've explained everything,

196
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,520
we can take you to see the girl.

197
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:33,720
Right?

198
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:34,640
Trust me.

199
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,320
Brother.

200
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,520
Xiao Chen was right.

201
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,600
If you're suffering,

202
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,280
if you've been wronged,

203
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,080
just tell me everything.

204
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:44,840
I'll stand up for you.

205
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,160
If you don't trust me,

206
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,200
let the girl go.

207
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,080
I'll be your hostage instead.

208
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,280
That way, you and I—

209
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:49,840
Don't move.

210
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,080
Alright.

211
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,200
That man—

212
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,400
I was the one who beat him to death.

213
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:53,720
I know.

214
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,400
With a hammer, right?

215
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,640
It's all been checked.

216
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,400
Your fingerprints are on it.

217
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,760
Nothing unusual here, right?

218
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,280
No.

219
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,360
Then now,

220
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,080
can you let the girl go?

221
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,320
Do you know where this is?

222
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,080
It's a hospital.

223
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,480
So why did Zhao Keyuan end up here?

224
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,680
Don't you know the reason yourself?

225
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,000
She did it for me.

226
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,480
You killed someone.

227
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,320
You made Zhao Keyuan take the blame.

228
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,840
Now you come here and take hostages.

229
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,840
Do you think this is saving her?

230
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,320
You're hurting her.

231
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,320
Have you ever thought

232
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:28,920
if she wanted

233
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,680
you to do this?

234
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,480
You killed someone,

235
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,320
but you let the woman you love

236
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,200
live in fear.

237
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,560
She almost chose death.

238
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,000
Do you know that?

239
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,360
You keep saying

240
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:37,960
you care about her,

241
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,480
you love her.

242
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,800
I don't think you care about her at all.

243
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,800
If you're really a man,

244
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,720
can't you stop dragging her down?

245
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,240
I...

246
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:42,840
I'm not...

247
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,200
I didn't...

248
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:44,840
You're not what?

249
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,680
Then tell me, who killed Li Xiaofeng?

250
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,360
It wasn't me.

251
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,960
It was that bad guy.

252
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,480
He always bullied her.

253
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,240
He'd come back and brag to the girl.

254
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:54,960
The girl, for

255
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,200
me to have enough to eat

256
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,840
and live in a big house,

257
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,440
put up with everything.

258
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,840
She suffered a lot from him.

259
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,320
She ran a small business to earn money,

260
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,840
but he took it all.

261
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,920
That bad guy did something terrible.

262
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,200
He got scared.

263
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,720
He went home

264
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,480
to take all the money

265
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,440
and run away.

266
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,600
The girl, for me,

267
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,960
refused to let him.

268
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,840
He beat her badly.

269
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:16,840
I saw she was about to

270
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,840
be beaten to death.

271
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,320
That's when I

272
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,080
hit him and killed him.

273
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,320
Alright.

274
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,680
Even if everything you said is true,

275
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,960
you still haven't

276
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,600
told me everything.

277
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,320
Wang Liuxi.

278
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,480
That's the bad guy.

279
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,320
He brought back

280
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,720
bags of stuff.

281
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,120
Where did he hide them?

282
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,120
What stuff?

283
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,200
I've never seen it.

284
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:38,960
The two of them

285
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,080
always

286
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,680
argued over something

287
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,320
and fought several times.

288
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,480
In the end,

289
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,680
the girl held scissors

290
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,080
to her chest to stop it.

291
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,200
Even though the Fool

292
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,120
is sometimes confused,

293
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,720
sometimes he's clear,

294
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,080
he's never lied to me.

295
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,080
Right?

296
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,560
Fool.

297
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,600
I didn't.

298
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,680
You're a good person.

299
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,200
You treat the girl well.

300
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,080
Brother Fool,

301
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,240
looks like you truly care about Zhao Keyuan.

302
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,480
If you care so much about her,

303
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,720
let this girl go.

304
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,960
I'll take you to see Zhao Keyuan now.

305
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,680
She's right over there.

306
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:08,480
Okay?

307
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,040
Let's go.

308
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,280
Hey.

309
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,320
You think I'm a fool?

310
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:10,560
Fine.

311
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,080
Don't move.

312
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,240
If you don't let go,

313
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,320
I won't let go either.

314
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:17,560
Brother,

315
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,680
by the rules,

316
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,000
we can't release Zhao Keyuan.

317
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,720
You killed someone.

318
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:23,840
Zhao Keyuan

319
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,080
hid you away.

320
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,680
She didn't tell us the truth.

321
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,960
Legally,

322
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,600
that's called harboring a criminal.

323
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,240
Do you understand harboring?

324
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,200
I don't care.

325
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,720
She's my only family.

326
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,600
Even if I die today,

327
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,960
you must let her go.

328
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,080
Nurse!

329
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,440
Quick!

330
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:38,960
Hurry!

331
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,480
Go now!

332
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:46,680
Go!

333
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:48,600
Go!

334
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:49,800
Go!

335
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:05,520
Hello?

336
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:06,600
Captain Lu.

337
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,320
Zhao Keyuan escaped.

338
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,240
Chief Shi.

339
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,000
Lu Ming,

340
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,600
just got word from narcotics.

341
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,880
They finally

342
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,240
caught an international drug lord.

343
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,040
One of Lakun's men.

344
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,240
According to the statement,

345
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,040
Lakun's biggest

346
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,120
domestic agent

347
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,240
is Zhao Keyuan.

348
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:34,960
You'd better keep

349
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,880
an eye on her for me.
