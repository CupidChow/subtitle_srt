1
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:15,840
Did you get any answers?

2
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,080
Not yet.

3
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,160
The Rat suddenly vanished.

4
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,680
He must have found out

5
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,440
Er Gou is dead.

6
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,360
If he wants to hide,

7
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,040
he's really hard to find.

8
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,440
I'll go catch a few more people.

9
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,440
We'll definitely find him.

10
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,040
Then why are you still standing here?

11
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:42,920
You didn't go home all night?

12
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:44,600
Yeah.

13
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,480
Go ahead, eat.

14
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,200
Thanks.

15
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,360
Captain Lu,

16
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,160
take a look.

17
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm now using the suspect's

18
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,160
disappearance point as the center,

19
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,720
pulling all the nearby surveillance footage.

20
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,120
As long as, around this center,

21
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,920
any woman

22
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,200
I'll investigate each one.

23
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,560
If I find

24
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,920
a woman with no traceable route,

25
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,560
it's likely we can conclude

26
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,560
she's the suspect disguised as a man.

27
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,200
Morning.

28
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,040
Got buns.

29
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,360
Why didn't you say you were hungry earlier?

30
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,400
You sure eat fast.

31
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,520
You guys didn't ask me.

32
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,640
I bought the buns for someone else.

33
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,320
But you ended up eating them.

34
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,680
It's fine.

35
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,280
Hello?

36
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,360
Hello?

37
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,280
Officer Qi,

38
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,720
we've made a major discovery.

39
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,840
A major discovery.

40
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:46,920
Call the team

41
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,480
to come and examine the scene.

42
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,480
Get the narcotics unit here too.

43
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,440
Share the information.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,360
No problem.

45
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:53,800
Officer,

46
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,280
when you came yesterday,

47
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,080
did you not find

48
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,120
Liu Dong's ID copy?

49
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,000
I've been thinking about it all night.

50
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,360
I thought

51
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,080
maybe it got mixed in

52
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,120
with other rental files.

53
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,360
Early this morning,

54
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,720
I got the property girl

55
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,840
to go through all the rental files

56
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,560
and checked them again.

57
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,560
Turns out

58
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,000
this unit

59
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,560
was also rented by someone named Liu Dong.

60
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:12,640
This unit,

61
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:13,920
for the

62
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,840
property payment record,

63
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,640
whose name was signed?

64
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,360
I checked,

65
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,640
looks like it was signed by

66
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,000
someone named Zhang Qiang.

67
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,360
Here,

68
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:23,800
this one.

69
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,480
Take a look.

70
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,240
Captain Lu,

71
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,320
look at Zhang Qiang's handwriting.

72
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,240
Compared to the one we brought in

73
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,160
Liu Dong

74
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,640
doesn't it look similar?

75
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:36,880
Take it back

76
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:37,800
for handwriting analysis.

77
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,920
This victim's background

78
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,800
is really complicated.

79
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,360
Where's Chen Minmin?

80
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,920
She's sharing details with narcotics.

81
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:55,920
Let's wait for her.

82
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:56,760
Let's look around.

83
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,080
The night before the crime,

84
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:20,520
it rained.

85
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,640
Only these two days were sunny.

86
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,800
These cigarette butts show no sign

87
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,160
of moisture at all.

88
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,360
That means someone

89
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,080
on the day of the crime

90
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,240
and up to now

91
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:29,960
stayed here.

92
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,920
Judging by the number of butts

93
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,160
and the trampled marks around,

94
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,920
they must've stayed here a long time.

95
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,240
Captain Lu,

96
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,040
You're thorough.

97
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,520
But

98
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,360
we checked the hallway cameras

99
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,640
and didn't spot this person.

100
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,480
If you ask me, this person

101
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,200
definitely knows about the cameras

102
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,080
and how they work.

103
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:52,960
Knows how to avoid them.

104
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,600
Most likely,

105
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,040
he guessed someone would come tonight,

106
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,480
so he waited here for them.

107
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,800
This person

108
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,640
could it be

109
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,480
Liu Dong?

110
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,880
One of Er Gou's hideouts

111
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,800
has already been raided by police.

112
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,640
Narcotics officers are here too.

113
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,320
I really can't get inside.

114
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,200
So you mean

115
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,080
you're not sure

116
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,960
if in that room

117
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,880
there's actually

118
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,800
what I want.

119
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,360
Right?

120
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,840
You didn't find The Rat's whereabouts.

121
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,480
Police beat you to it again.

122
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,280
A Li,

123
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,080
my patience

124
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,600
is running out.

125
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,720
Major breakthrough

126
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:51,920
Everybody (everyone)

127
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,040
The DNA from the cigarette butt

128
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,960
The test report is out

129
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,600
This person's real name is Wang Zhi

130
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,400
His street nickname is The Rat

131
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,040
He works for someone called Er Gou

132
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,160
Er Gou's top henchman in the drug ring

133
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,960
The narcotics team says

134
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,040
they've been searching for

135
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,920
this man, Er Gou

136
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,400
They say their lead

137
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,480
seems to be controlled by The Rat

138
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,280
but actually

139
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,520
Er Gou is the real mastermind behind it

140
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,240
He always keeps a low profile

141
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,520
No one knows what he looks like

142
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,400
let alone has any info on him

143
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,960
If The Rat acts personally,

144
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,280
it must be for Er Gou

145
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,040
No wonder Er Gou

146
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,600
never slips up

147
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,480
He really blends in as a regular guy

148
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,560
just living a normal life

149
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,160
Unbelievable

150
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,520
Now it seems

151
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,480
all the doubts we've had

152
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,840
finally make sense

153
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,920
Why, from all the signs,

154
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,400
does this killer

155
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,480
not act like an ordinary person

156
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,840
but is actually very skilled

157
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:41,920
And why

158
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,720
was there such expensive wine at home

159
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,080
And as for why

160
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,240
the phone at home went missing

161
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,640
I think

162
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,960
it might be because

163
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,600
it held clues about the drug dealers

164
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,480
If that's the case

165
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,160
the killer must also be

166
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,040
involved in the drug ring

167
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,160
Captain Lu

168
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,160
I found in the surveillance

169
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,400
a key frame of the killer's face

170
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,400
Come take a look

171
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,840
Zhao Keyuan

172
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,920
Earlier, when we reviewed the footage

173
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,400
we focused only on the killer

174
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,480
After Captain Lu found the cigarette butt

175
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,480
I checked again

176
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,600
the footage of the killer leaving

177
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,920
and found Wang Zhi

178
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,640
He drove here

179
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,600
He parked on the next street

180
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,360
then walked over

181
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,400
The license plate is

182
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,600
PU8T33

183
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,240
Xiao Yu

184
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:26,840
I know

185
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,480
I'm checking it now

186
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,480
This car

187
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,280
lately at night

188
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,520
has been going to a place called

189
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,600
Yuewan Guesthouse

190
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,400
I don't care if you're The Rat

191
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,080
or Zhao Keyuan

192
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,160
I'm taking you in

193
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,280
Let's go

194
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,520
Keyuan

195
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,400
The luggage is loaded

196
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,080
We can leave now

197
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,480
That Fool you have

198
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,720
did he fall into the police's hands?

199
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,240
Yes

200
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,280
But a dead body

201
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,840
won't change anything for them

202
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,040
This month

203
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,400
the narcotics team has busted three of my spots

204
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,800
You'd better hope

205
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,480
nothing goes wrong on your end

206
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,440
One last time

207
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,920
Is the Fool dead or not?

208
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,360
I'm sure

209
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,040
he's dead

210
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,480
You'd better make sure

211
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,280
Otherwise

212
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,360
both of you

213
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,520
won't leave here in one piece

214
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,600
Who is it?

215
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,160
In Rongcheng

216
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,600
I doubt you can get away now

217
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,080
So that's who it is

218
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,960
Then tell Er Gou

219
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,600
if he wants to negotiate

220
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,160
he should come see me

221
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:07,520
Keyuan

222
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,840
The news that Fool is alive

223
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,160
must never reach Lakun

224
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,240
You go first

225
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,080
I'll stay

226
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,840
to find Er Gou

227
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,240
and his man

228
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:15,960
The Rat

229
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,280
We'll take them out together

230
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,640
Then go after Fool

231
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,280
and end all future trouble

232
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,520
Keyuan

233
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,160
Keyuan

234
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,160
I'm doing this for you

235
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:25,640
Keyuan

236
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,400
Try touching him and see

237
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,080
We've found The Rat's hideout

238
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,240
Should we take him out now?

239
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,160
Bring him back

240
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:40,640
Okay
