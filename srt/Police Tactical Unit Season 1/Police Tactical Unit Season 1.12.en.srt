1
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,320
So you killed to avoid being killed,

2
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,120
and ended up killing Zhen Xiaoyu first.

3
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,640
I didn't want to do it either.

4
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,000
I never thought things would turn out like that.

5
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,320
It wasn't on purpose.

6
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,560
Are you ignoring me when I talk to you?

7
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,360
Do you believe I'll kill you too?

8
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:29,800
I'll kill—

9
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,000
I'll kill—

10
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,640
Go!

11
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,480
I'll kill—

12
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,360
What are you doing, Zhen Xiaoyu?

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,520
Zhen Xiaoyu!

14
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,520
What are you doing?

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,200
No!

16
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:36,800
Don't do anything rash.

17
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,160
What are you doing?

18
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:39,800
No.

19
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,320
No.

20
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:40,920
No.

21
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:41,960
Ah!

22
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,120
I've killed someone.

23
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,200
I...

24
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,320
I've killed someone!

25
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,560
So you're saying

26
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,840
it was Sheng Xiaole

27
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,360
who killed Zhen Xiaoyu?

28
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,120
Is that right?

29
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,360
I don't know.

30
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,600
It was total chaos at the time.

31
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,160
I honestly can't remember

32
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,160
who had the knife in the end.

33
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,400
And then?

34
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,280
The kidnappers

35
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,040
kept their word

36
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:12,920
and let us go.

37
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,560
After Xiaoyu died,

38
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,280
Sheng Xiaole and I were terrified.

39
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,080
We just stood there,

40
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,680
frozen for a long time before moving.

41
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:21,760
By then,

42
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,880
the time limit was already up.

43
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,560
We finally gathered our courage

44
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,680
and walked toward the door.

45
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,320
But the kidnappers

46
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,280
were already gone.

47
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,640
At first,

48
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,000
we suspected

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,440
the kidnappers were playing a prank.

50
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,680
We never thought someone would actually die.

51
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,200
Zhen Xiaoyu...

52
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,040
Who handled the body?

53
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:38,920
Sheng Xiaole and I did.

54
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,560
I felt so sorry for Zhen Xiaoyu.

55
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,000
And we were afraid the police would find us.

56
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,000
So Sheng Xiaole and I

57
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:43,920
took care of the body.

58
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:44,760
What about the murder weapon?

59
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:45,920
The weapon—

60
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,760
We threw it into the river.

61
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,520
After that, the kidnappers

62
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,040
never contacted you again?

63
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:52,880
They did.

64
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,560
The day after we got back,

65
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,560
they sent us a blackmail email.

66
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,800
The server was overseas.

67
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,440
It had photos of Sheng Xiaole and me

68
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,280
burying the body.

69
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,280
At that time,

70
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,320
I sold

71
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,760
everything valuable I had.

72
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,280
Back then, Sheng Xiaole

73
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,760
had just lost his father.

74
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,280
He didn't leave much inheritance.

75
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,400
That's why he considered selling his house.

76
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,480
This Qian Junjie—

77
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,400
just told me

78
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,880
a long, convincing story.

79
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,480
If he's lying,

80
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,400
he's incredibly cunning.

81
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,520
Besides, Zhen Xiaoyu's body

82
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,560
is just bones now.

83
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,240
There's not a single clue left.

84
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,360
So do you think what he said

85
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,120
could be true?

86
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,080
I think he's definitely lying.

87
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:48,600
He...

88
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:50,720
The way he told it

89
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,680
felt to me like

90
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,120
he practiced it a hundred times in the mirror.

91
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,320
And that whole

92
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,440
"murder game"—

93
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,920
he really could come up with that.

94
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,240
But then again,

95
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,600
maybe

96
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,960
the two robbers are just psychos.

97
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,600
Xiaoyu found out

98
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,440
Qian Junjie's father

99
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:08,840
recently

100
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,200
has been thinking about making a will.

101
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:11,840
But

102
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,440
it seems his father

103
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,920
doesn't want to leave the inheritance to Qian Junjie.

104
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,440
If that's the case,

105
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,200
then Qian Junjie

106
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,120
hiring kidnappers

107
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,600
to kill Old Qian gives him motive.

108
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,200
That's the motive.

109
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,720
But why didn't he

110
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,920
remove himself from the case?

111
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,080
He could've played the victim.

112
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,320
Hidden in plain sight.

113
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,120
Now Zhen Xiaoyu's case

114
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,360
has already come to light.

115
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,480
What I can't figure out now is,

116
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,040
if Qian Junjie is the killer,

117
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,680
why would he kill Sheng Xiaole?

118
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,600
There must be some details

119
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,240
we've missed.

120
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:39,560
Qilu—

121
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,120
Keep a close eye on Qian Junjie for me.

122
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,160
Watch him closely.

123
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:42,800
Yeah.

124
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,280
Absolutely.

125
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:00,680
What's wrong?

126
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:05,920
Qilu

127
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:06,880
Old Lu

128
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,240
I have an idea.

129
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:08,920
Go ahead.

130
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,040
Go ahead.

131
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,440
This Qian Junjie

132
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,360
never leaves his house

133
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,120
at all, not even once.

134
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,880
Xiaoyu monitors all his calls.

135
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:15,880
So tell me,

136
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,280
the only person he meets is the delivery guy.

137
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,840
Should we check out this delivery guy?

138
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:20,800
I'll have Xiaoyu

139
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,960
look up the order records.

140
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,280
But it could be

141
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,200
an unregistered delivery guy.

142
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,080
You two should

143
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,960
review the apartment's surveillance.

144
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,000
Okay.

145
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,520
Checked the surveillance.

146
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,200
Captain Lu

147
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:36,960
What's the situation?

148
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,360
This delivery guy

149
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,160
just registered recently.

150
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,120
Only delivered two orders.

151
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,440
Both to Qian Junjie's place.

152
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,760
He has a friend

153
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,360
living with him.

154
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,440
Actors.

155
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,640
Long Ye and Zhao Wu.

156
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,040
They used to be stunt doubles.

157
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,240
Haven't had any roles since.

158
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,520
So they started working

159
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,320
as NPCs in various places.

160
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,400
Last May,

161
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,520
they received five hundred thousand yuan.

162
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:55,960
Cash deposit.

163
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,080
Recently,

164
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,240
another tens of thousands

165
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,040
was transferred to their accounts.

166
00:05:59,680 --> 00:05:59,880
Alright.

167
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,600
So it's definitely those two.

168
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,360
No doubt about it.

169
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,040
We don't know anything.

170
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,520
We're just actors he hired.

171
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,440
Why kill Zhen Xiaoyu?

172
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,040
We really didn't kill her.

173
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,080
Qian Junjie did it himself.

174
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,160
Qian Junjie did it.

175
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,080
That's right.

176
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,680
According to the script,

177
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,320
Zhen Xiaoyu wasn't supposed to die.

178
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,240
She was supposed to kill Sheng Xiaole.

179
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,800
But Zhen Xiaoyu couldn't do it.

180
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,800
Qian Junjie improvised

181
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,880
and added a twist for himself.

182
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,600
He stabbed Zhen Xiaoyu in the chaos.

183
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:26,960
Sheng Xiaole

184
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,240
was totally out of it,

185
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,040
didn't know anything.

186
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,600
No idea at all

187
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,600
if he did it himself.

188
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,440
What script?

189
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,880
This Qian Junjie

190
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,520
wrote a script.

191
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,240
All our lines and actions

192
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,600
were based on it.

193
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,400
Because Zhen Xiaoyu

194
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,320
didn't follow the script,

195
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,600
he got pretty mad later.

196
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,400
Where's the script?

197
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,320
Thrown away.

198
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,080
At first, we were excited.

199
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,080
Thought it was a real casting.

200
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:45,800
But later,

201
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,880
he asked us to rehearse.

202
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:47,880
I never thought

203
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,960
he'd actually kill someone.

204
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:50,680
After that,

205
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,760
he paid us a sum.

206
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,600
And threatened us

207
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,600
not to tell anyone.

208
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,760
Or we'd all go to jail.

209
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,000
A few months ago,

210
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,160
he came to us again.

211
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,600
Asked if we wanted

212
00:06:59,160 --> 00:06:59,760
to do it again.

213
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:00,880
He said

214
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,760
he wanted to pretend

215
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,480
to be kidnapped again.

216
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,640
Who knows

217
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,280
what he was up to?

218
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,480
It's not like we didn't think

219
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,440
he'd pull the same trick again.

220
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,040
But

221
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,720
he had dirt on us.

222
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,040
So

223
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,160
we just went along with it.

224
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,440
Did it with him again.

225
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,120
But

226
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,160
his relationship with his dad

227
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,760
is really bad.

228
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,320
His son got kidnapped,

229
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,280
but his dad didn't say a word of comfort.

230
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,160
Even slapped him.

231
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:23,600
Stop!

232
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:25,600
Don't shoot!

233
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,040
Don't shoot!

234
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:26,440
Junjie!

235
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,160
Don't shoot!

236
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:28,880
Don't shoot!

237
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,920
You already took the money.

238
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,320
And the act is over.

239
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,920
Why aren't you leaving?

240
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,440
We thought,

241
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,600
Qian Junjie used this case to threaten us.

242
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,840
So we threatened him too.

243
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,320
We went to ask him for money.

244
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,160
So we went to see Qian Junjie.

245
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,280
We even disguised ourselves

246
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,200
as delivery workers.

247
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,440
How much did he give you?

248
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,440
He didn't have much cash.

249
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,040
He just gave us some

250
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,880
watches

251
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,880
and other luxury items.

252
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,320
We sold them off bit by bit.

253
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,320
But we didn't have good connections.

254
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,280
Didn't get much for them.

255
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,440
But he promised

256
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,120
after he inherited the estate,

257
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,200
he'd give us five million.

258
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,480
So,

259
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,880
you blackmailed Qian Junjie,

260
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,040
and he just handed over

261
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,880
the money to you?

262
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,440
Honestly,

263
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,360
we recorded him.

264
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,760
The first time we went,

265
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,840
we weren't prepared.

266
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,880
But the second time,

267
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,480
we were more careful.

268
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,720
We made a recording.

269
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,040
Where's the recording?

270
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,040
At my place.

271
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:44,920
Officer,

272
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:45,840
we

273
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,760
at most, it's blackmail.

274
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,040
Can we get a lighter sentence?

275
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,040
We'll see.

276
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,440
Old Lu,

277
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,040
now we can confirm

278
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,240
the robbers were hired by Qian Junjie.

279
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,040
That kid is ruthless.

280
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,760
He'd even go after his own father.

281
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,480
Interrogate again.

282
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,680
No, officer,

283
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,800
it's been so long,

284
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,560
and you haven't even found the kidnappers.

285
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,440
Why do you keep calling me in?

286
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,360
Calm down.

287
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,800
The kidnappers have been caught.

288
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,560
Have you seen them?

289
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,240
No.

290
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,480
Are you saying

291
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,360
these two people

292
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,560
are the ones who killed my dad?

293
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,360
Do you know what they said?

294
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,560
What did they say?

295
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,360
How would I know?

296
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,360
They said

297
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,480
it was you

298
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,040
who hired them.

299
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,480
Officer,

300
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,800
you believe the kidnappers' lies?

301
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,920
If you investigate like this,

302
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,760
I really doubt your ability.

303
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:04,880
This time,

304
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,880
I wanted to teach that old man a lesson.

305
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,120
Don't worry.

306
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,120
This time,

307
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,000
no one would die.

308
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,320
Qian Junjie.

309
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,920
Zhao Wu and Long Ye

310
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,120
aren't as dumb as you think.

311
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,760
They were afraid you'd

312
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,800
pull the same trick again.

313
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,880
So they recorded you.

314
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,360
What does that prove?

315
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,800
That I hired them.

316
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,760
So what?

317
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,480
The recording

318
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,160
only proves I hired them.

319
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,920
It can't prove I killed anyone.

320
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,480
I really just wanted

321
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,360
to teach my dad a lesson.

322
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,760
I didn't know

323
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,240
those two robbers

324
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,240
got greedy on the spot

325
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,160
and decided to kill.

326
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,880
Officer,

327
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,480
they're the robbers.

328
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,240
I'm the victim here.

329
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,680
As police,

330
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,800
shouldn't you give the victim

331
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,680
justice?

332
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,480
What about Zhen Xiaoyu?

333
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,920
Doesn't that have anything to do with you?

334
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,480
Didn't I say

335
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,120
it was chaotic at the time?

336
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,360
I really didn't know

337
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,480
who killed Zhen Xiaoyu.

338
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,160
The law says

339
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,320
"innocent until proven guilty."

340
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,920
If you

341
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,360
can't prove I killed anyone,

342
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,600
you can't convict me.

343
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,000
This Qian Junjie

344
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,040
is truly cunning.

345
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,880
All your questions,

346
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,560
he already has answers prepared.

347
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,040
Now,

348
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,600
Qian Junjie insists

349
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,360
it was Sheng Xiaole who killed Zhen Xiaoyu.

350
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,680
He even blames the killing of Old Qian

351
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,040
entirely on those two robbers.

352
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,560
Is there really no other way?

353
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,440
Script
