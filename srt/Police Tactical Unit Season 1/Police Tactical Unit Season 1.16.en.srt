1
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,720
Xiao Zhi

2
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,600
Xiao Zhi

3
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,960
Xiao Zhi

4
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,200
This is the mark I gave you.

5
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,320
You belong to me now.

6
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,720
Deceased: Xiao Zhi

7
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,520
Eighteen years old

8
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,080
Rongcheng Normal University

9
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,960
First-year student

10
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,280
Mother: Li Likun

11
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,040
Forty-eight years old

12
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,400
Public sector employee

13
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,600
Li Likun witnessed

14
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,040
her own son jump to his death.

15
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,400
District police determined

16
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,040
it was a clear suicide.

17
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:54,960
I can't make sense of this.

18
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,480
What are these stitched patterns?

19
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,280
I'm quite sure

20
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,600
judging by the stitching,

21
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,640
he did it himself.

22
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,080
Himself.

23
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,400
That must hurt a lot.

24
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,640
This kind of skin embroidery

25
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,880
has tons of tutorials online.

26
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,400
They even explain

27
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,040
which techniques and methods

28
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,600
can minimize the pain.

29
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,720
This embroidery

30
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,960
originated from Japan.

31
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,200
It first appeared

32
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,960
in a Japanese manga character.

33
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,880
It's mainly popular among teens.

34
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,760
But

35
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,840
let's not forget,

36
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,520
Xiao Zhi's mother once said

37
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,400
Xiao Zhi is

38
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,720
a rather steady kid.

39
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,400
He wouldn't

40
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,640
do this just to be trendy

41
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,480
or for fashion.

42
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,960
So this embroidery must be

43
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,280
pointing to a special clue.

44
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,280
We just don't know yet.

45
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,160
Right?

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,320
Hey.

47
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,480
Why does this look like an owl?

48
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,320
And the English below says

49
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,400
Lily, right?

50
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,280
Yes.

51
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,480
This is

52
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,080
the skin embroidery on Xiao Zhi's chest.

53
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,400
Forensic analysis shows

54
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,280
it was done a few hours

55
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,640
before Xiao Zhi died.

56
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,200
A few hours before his death.

57
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,840
This kid

58
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,520
wouldn't end his life for no reason.

59
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,200
I asked all his friends

60
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,080
and classmates since childhood.

61
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,960
No one knows this person.

62
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,720
Do you know about his relationships?

63
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,480
He never tells me anything.

64
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,640
So that means

65
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,520
the embroidery on him

66
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,640
is also news to you.

67
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,160
I'm very busy with work.

68
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,360
I'm often away on business trips.

69
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,320
Since elementary school,

70
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,440
Xiao Zhi went to and from school alone.

71
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,000
He's very independent.

72
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,600
But he doesn't talk much.

73
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,120
Anything

74
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,440
he keeps to himself.

75
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,000
So Xiao Zhi,

76
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,320
what does he usually like to do?

77
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,000
Probably play games.

78
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,320
Once he sits at the computer,

79
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:57,840
he won't get up.

80
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,960
It's all my fault.

81
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,840
I should've spent more time with him.

82
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,840
Cared for him more.

83
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,600
Before Xiao Zhi's suicide,

84
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,680
did he act strangely?

85
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,720
A while ago,

86
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,960
he asked me for money.

87
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,960
Said he wanted to buy clothes.

88
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,240
I thought

89
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,720
he was growing up,

90
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,680
learning to dress himself.

91
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,240
But then he turned and said

92
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,120
he didn't need it anymore.

93
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,600
Every day,

94
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,600
he ate barely anything.

95
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,560
I told him to eat more,

96
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,200
he said he was dieting.

97
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,080
His mood kept getting worse.

98
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,320
Every time I came home from a trip,

99
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,200
I saw his condition

100
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,560
getting worse each time.

101
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:15,960
He even

102
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,560
He wouldn't say a word to me.

103
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,200
This Lily...

104
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,720
Where on earth

105
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,000
did you come from, you death-bringer?

106
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,680
Xiao Zhi

107
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,520
Xiao Zhi

108
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,000
Where's Lao Ji?

109
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,440
He went to the Shi Bureau.

110
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,200
Xiao Yu.

111
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,040
Here are Xiao Zhi's phone and computer.

112
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:03,920
Okay.

113
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,560
Xiao Zhi probably

114
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,760
had quite severe depression.

115
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,680
But his mother didn't know.

116
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,840
Depression.

117
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,320
Suicide.

118
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:12,880
What triggered it?

119
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,880
Xiao Zhi's mother

120
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,040
knew very little about him.

121
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,720
But according to her account,

122
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,160
and my own observations,

123
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,120
to sum up,

124
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,000
in the past month,

125
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,120
Xiao Zhi acted very strangely.

126
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,680
He started losing weight,

127
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,160
and cared about his appearance.

128
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,040
Maybe he liked someone.

129
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,000
But one thing is odd.

130
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,000
He didn't show

131
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,960
the usual drive

132
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,920
to pursue love.

133
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,040
Instead, he grew more withdrawn each day.

134
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,240
He sat at his computer

135
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,240
for entire days.

136
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,440
Was this

137
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,320
an online romance gone wrong?

138
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,320
Li Likun

139
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,560
asked her son about it,

140
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:43,720
but he

141
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,000
didn't deny it.

142
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,080
Maybe Lily

143
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,640
never appeared

144
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,120
in Xiao Zhi's real life.

145
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,520
At Xiao Zhi's funeral,

146
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,200
only classmates and friends attended.

147
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,960
But judging by their expressions,

148
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,440
no one seemed

149
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,800
to be a girlfriend.

150
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,520
Lily and Xiao Zhi—

151
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,520
when did they meet?

152
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,360
I guess

153
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,240
they met about a month ago.

154
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,880
That's when Xiao Zhi

155
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,800
started acting strange.

156
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,600
And Li Likun said

157
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,160
her son feared pain since childhood,

158
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,680
especially illness and injury.

159
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,960
But those skin embroideries

160
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,440
you all saw on him.

161
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:17,880
Mm.

162
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,360
The problem now is

163
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,240
there's no direct evidence

164
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,680
to prove Lily

165
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,960
was directly involved

166
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,680
in Xiao Zhi's death.

167
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,080
Maybe it was just Xiao Zhi's unrequited love.

168
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,680
He couldn't get over it emotionally,

169
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,520
so he took his own life.

170
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,360
Indeed.

171
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,440
Because we haven't found

172
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,880
any clues about the owl.

173
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:40,960
Captain Lu.

174
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,360
I've recovered some deleted chats

175
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,080
from Xiao Zhi.

176
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,600
I'm sharing them now.

177
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,360
The chat logs show

178
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,800
Xiao Zhi wasn't just pining alone.

179
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,600
Lily was his girlfriend.

180
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,240
They'd been together for about a month.

181
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,080
There's something off about Lily.

182
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,800
The chats show

183
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,520
there's little info on Lily's identity.

184
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,400
But she kept hinting to Xiao Zhi

185
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,520
that suicide is a kind of release.

186
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,200
Lily

187
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,120
when Xiao Zhi wanted to end his life,

188
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,840
didn't comfort him at all.

189
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,400
She even encouraged him.

190
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,280
That's inciting suicide.

191
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,120
Xiao Yu.

192
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,960
Check Lily's identity.

193
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,480
Okay.

194
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:33,920
Tao Weiyi.

195
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:34,960
Twenty-seven years old.

196
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,080
Fashion model by profession.

197
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,920
She wasn't always called Lily.

198
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,760
She was Lesley.

199
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:40,800
Lesley.

200
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,640
Lesley, nice to meet you.
(A pun on her name.)

201
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,480
Li Ya Qilu.

202
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,360
Find her.

203
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,120
Check her connection to the deceased.

204
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,760
What's really going on?

205
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,080
Okay.

206
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,360
Are you

207
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,680
Xiao Zhi's girlfriend?

208
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:58,520
Ah.

209
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,280
Yes.

210
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,240
I'm Xiao Zhi's girlfriend.

211
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,200
Xiao Zhi committed suicide—

212
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,200
did you know?

213
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,200
It's not a surprise.

214
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,480
Xiao Zhi's mental state

215
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,640
was always poor.

216
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:16,840
We

217
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:17,960
are both troubled.

218
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,360
How did you meet?

219
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,240
We met in a game.

220
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,480
We

221
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,240
are deeply connected

222
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,640
in spirit.

223
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:31,920
Although

224
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,240
there's a big age gap,

225
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:34,920
but

226
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,680
undeniably,

227
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,680
we truly are

228
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,800
each other's soulmate.

229
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:42,480
This—

230
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,240
do you recognize it?

231
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,280
I know this.

232
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,040
Xiao Zhi embroidered it himself.

233
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,760
He did it beautifully.

234
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:58,960
He's the most

235
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,800
thoughtful boy I've met.

236
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,960
Why did you do this?

237
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,120
Because neither of us was happy.

238
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:09,680
So—

239
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,920
What did you embroider before?

240
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,400
I wanted to make a flower,

241
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,600
but I failed.

242
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,360
I'm clumsy.

243
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,280
Then why did Xiao Zhi

244
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,800
embroider the owl?

245
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,920
I don't know.

246
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:29,920
But—

247
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,480
Officer Qi,

248
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,160
how did you discover me?
