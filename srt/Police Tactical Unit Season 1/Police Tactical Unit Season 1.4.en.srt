1
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,480
The time of the crime is

2
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,600
between one and three thirty a.m.

3
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,480
This car

4
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,720
left at two fifty-two a.m.

5
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,800
used the access card to exit

6
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,800
According to the security guard's memory,

7
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,400
the driver wore a mask and a hat.

8
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:28,560
Xiaoyu

9
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,600
Did you check this license plate?

10
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,160
Checked.

11
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,040
It's a cloned plate.

12
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,680
No other camera angles?

13
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,360
There are.

14
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,160
But in this Xinzong Xiaoqu,

15
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:35,800
because

16
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,360
they wanted to save money,

17
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,680
many cameras are broken

18
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,600
and haven't been fixed.

19
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,360
They collect property fees

20
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,560
and still skimp on small expenses.

21
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:42,960
Looks like

22
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,360
there's no sign of forced entry.

23
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,560
Could it be someone familiar?

24
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,800
We're not pursuing that angle now.

25
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,480
They

26
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,800
just arrived in Rongcheng too.

27
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,240
He also said

28
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,600
yesterday Zhu Jin was at Commercial Plaza

29
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,280
and lost her wallet.

30
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,160
The wallet had an access card and keys.

31
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,800
With the keys, no need to break the lock.

32
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,160
Forensics show from the autopsy

33
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:00,840
marks appeared on the face

34
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,920
consistent with mechanical asphyxiation.

35
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,040
On the victim's face

36
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,480
there were even abrasions.

37
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:05,800
Just think about

38
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,480
how much force that took.

39
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,120
It was likely a spur-of-the-moment crime.

40
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,920
Otherwise, the tools or method

41
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,240
wouldn't be so sloppy.

42
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,480
Could the victim have woken up

43
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,160
and the suspect attacked in panic?

44
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,280
The final chapter suits us so well.

45
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,120
Sure.

46
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,800
We can buy that.

47
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,160
Okay.

48
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,840
After we buy it,

49
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,160
let's go see a movie.

50
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,480
Okay.

51
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,680
Don't cry.

52
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:34,800
Don't cry, don't cry.

53
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:36,840
So noisy.

54
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,280
Her.

55
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:40,800
What are you doing?

56
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,040
Sorry, sorry.

57
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:43,800
My family is poor.

58
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,280
The child's father is sick too.

59
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,120
My child and I have no choice.

60
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,040
Please let us go just this once.

61
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,720
Just this once.

62
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,040
I won't dare again.

63
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,720
Maybe just forget it.

64
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,120
I didn't lose anything anyway.

65
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:54,920
No.

66
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,600
We have to call the police.

67
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,480
Forgive me this time.

68
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,360
Please let me go.

69
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,360
You again.

70
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,040
Officer.

71
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,560
Oh, I...

72
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,040
This time

73
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,480
Enough.

74
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,120
Cut the act.

75
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,720
My family really is poor.

76
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,920
Look, the child is so young.

77
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,600
Enough talk.

78
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,120
Take her away.

79
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,360
Hey, forgive me this time.

80
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,840
Oh no.

81
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,480
Come with us.

82
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,600
Wang Qingchun

83
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,920
You're way too bold.

84
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:23,800
Tell me,

85
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,160
how many times this month have you been here?

86
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,280
Officer.

87
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,680
You can arrest me,

88
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,920
but my child...

89
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,280
Get someone to take the child.

90
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,680
You have to spend a few days inside.

91
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,560
There's no one at home.

92
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,360
It's fine.

93
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,480
We'll have a female officer take the child.

94
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,720
Hand over your phone.

95
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:47,960
Baby.

96
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,280
Be good.

97
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,760
Don't cry, don't cry.

98
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,400
Be good.

99
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
The district detectives

100
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,520
have also recently

101
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,400
received several

102
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,600
burglary cases.

103
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,800
The victims all

104
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,760
lost their wallets

105
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,800
and keys before being robbed.

106
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,040
Could be the same gang.

107
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,360
If they're pros,

108
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,520
they wouldn't attack even if caught.

109
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,520
That doesn't fit criminal psychology.

110
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,760
And there's rape too.

111
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,720
Violence.

112
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,280
May not be just burglary.

113
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,000
Could also be

114
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,640
a crime of passion.

115
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,400
I think

116
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,040
our breakthrough

117
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,280
could be that thief.

118
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,600
But Commercial Plaza is huge.

119
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,120
Zhu Jin didn't report it.

120
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,120
How do we investigate?

121
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,280
Li Ya

122
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:37,880
Chen Minmin

123
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,400
Go ask at the nearby stations.

124
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,240
These repeat thieves

125
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,760
are known to those officers.

126
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,120
Xiaoyu

127
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,160
Get the locations

128
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,600
where phones were reported lost

129
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,520
and pull all nearby footage.

130
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,240
Run facial recognition quickly.

131
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,040
If

132
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,880
it's a gang,

133
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,640
some faces

134
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,920
will show up

135
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:58,760
at both scenes.

136
00:04:59,640 --> 00:04:59,800
Okay.

137
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,480
No problem.

138
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,400
Hello, Captain Lu

139
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,520
Hello, Li Ya

140
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,240
How are things on your end?

141
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,920
We visited the Commercial Plaza

142
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,040
and several key shops nearby

143
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,520
We haven't found anything yet

144
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,800
Expand the search area

145
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:28,640
This thief

146
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,560
might not only operate

147
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,640
within the Commercial Plaza

148
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:31,520
Okay

149
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:33,800
Widen the search

150
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,440
Wang Qingchun

151
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,560
You can go now

152
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,520
Thank you, officer

153
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,800
I have to say something to you

154
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,360
Can't you just behave yourself?

155
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,240
Did you ever think

156
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,240
about how your kid will see you

157
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:46,960
when they grow up?

158
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:47,840
Yeah

159
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,360
My kid is still young

160
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,240
I won't do this kind of thing again

161
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,520
That's the right attitude

162
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,480
As a person

163
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,680
you should stick to being honest

164
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:57,920
Here's your phone

165
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,720
Don't let me catch you again

166
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,640
Officer

167
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,720
What about my kid?

168
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,880
Don't worry about that

169
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,080
The female officer in the office

170
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:04,760
is watching them

171
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,280
Go on

172
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,280
Thank you, officer

173
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,000
Thanks

174
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,360
What's wrong?

175
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,280
We're investigating a recent

176
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,080
home invasion murder

177
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,280
We suspect the killer

178
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,160
might be a habitual thief

179
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,280
So I wanted to ask

180
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:31,800
about our area

181
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,440
Got it

182
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,560
We have detailed records

183
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,720
on all the local thieves

184
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,560
Let me go get them

185
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,000
Okay

186
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,360
You keep acting mysterious and won't say

187
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,360
What's really going on?

188
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,280
Huh?

189
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,440
Hurry up and talk

190
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,160
You're driving me crazy

191
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:57,840
Just say it

192
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,320
Spit it out

193
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,240
Tell me, what's happened?

194
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,720
I'm involved in a murder

195
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,480
Murder?

196
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,600
Hurry, hurry

197
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,320
Open the door

198
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:08,880
Let's talk inside

199
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:10,880
Murder

200
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,160
Did you get the

201
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,120
photos I sent you?

202
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,440
Mix these with the previous ones

203
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,240
and hype them up together

204
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,960
I want to warm up for The Thief Exhibition

205
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,600
Mina

206
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,720
The Thief Exhibition

207
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,000
That's my new idea I mentioned

208
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:35,560
Go ahead and do it

209
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
What exactly happened?

210
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,440
It's about

211
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,680
the Xinzong Xiaoqu case

212
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,840
Someone really died?

213
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,760
Zhuang Wei

214
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,240
They tied the rope so tight

215
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,440
When I left, the person

216
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,000
wasn't moving at all

217
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,040
That bastard Yan Dajun

218
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:58,720
He, he

219
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,560
How could he do something so stupid?

220
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,120
How about this

221
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,560
Let's just run away now

222
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,240
The police definitely can't find us now

223
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,680
There are cameras everywhere outside

224
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,320
Where could you even go?

225
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,000
At that moment

226
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,680
I was totally stunned

227
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,240
Thinking about it now

228
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,280
I should've risked everything

229
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,400
to stop them

230
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:16,960
I just...

231
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,160
Your mind is a mess right now

232
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,240
Anyway, you didn't kill anyone

233
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,480
Should I turn myself in?

234
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,560
You turn yourself in?

235
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,040
What do you mean?

236
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,280
Sorry about that.

237
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,920
Excuse me, this milk tea—

238
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,880
Where did you buy it?

239
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,560
Just downstairs.

240
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,280
Minmin.

241
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:13,920
What's wrong?

242
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:15,800
Li Ya.

243
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,680
It's all my fault.

244
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,120
That day, in Zhu Jin's trash bin—

245
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,880
I saw an empty cup from this milk tea shop.

246
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,000
I thought at the time,

247
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,560
just a girl had a milk tea.

248
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,240
Nothing unusual.

249
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,600
So I didn't report it.

250
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,040
How many times have I told you?

251
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,120
Any clue at the crime scene—

252
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,360
never assume or ignore it.

253
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,280
Enough.

254
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,440
Come check the footage with me.

255
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:35,680
You—

256
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,360
You turn yourself in.

257
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,720
What do you mean?

258
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,360
I'll confess.

259
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,800
I'll take all the blame.

260
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,680
You take Dabao home.

261
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,040
Look after her at school.

262
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,920
Easy for you to say.

263
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:47,680
Um—

264
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,480
The police will find out sooner or later.

265
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,480
So what do we do?

266
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,360
How about we run back home now?

267
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,680
Hide out in the mountains.

268
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,920
The police won't find us there, right?

269
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,040
Darn it.

270
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,120
If all three of you keep quiet—

271
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,120
maybe the police really won't find us.

272
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,480
There's no escape.

273
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,160
He's not just a petty thief.

274
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,360
He killed someone.

275
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:10,680
You—

276
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,480
You're right.

277
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,360
If every day

278
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,800
we have to keep hiding—

279
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,800
I'd rather turn myself in.

280
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:17,800
Then—

281
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,440
Then—

282
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,040
What about Dajun and Yang Tian?

283
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:23,800
If you don't look out for yourself—

284
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,480
heaven and earth will punish you.

285
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,240
This is their sin.

286
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,240
I'll confess tomorrow.

287
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,360
They did all this.

288
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,480
I didn't do it myself.

289
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,160
If I—

290
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,920
get sentenced for a few years,

291
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,440
will you wait for me?

292
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,880
Darn it.

293
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,720
Hey.

294
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,480
All checked.

295
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
Why are you on your phone?

296
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,920
Take a break, Lao Lu.

297
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,360
We've checked over ten places.

298
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,920
How's the search going?

299
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,280
Commercial Plaza.

300
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,440
And Xinzong Xiaoqu.

301
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,680
Compared both sides' footage.

302
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,680
No matching suspects found.

303
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:18,480
Captain Lu—

304
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,280
Come take a look.
