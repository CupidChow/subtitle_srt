1
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,360
Even if I die today,

2
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,760
you must let her go.

3
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,240
Go.

4
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,240
Go.

5
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:32,760
Go.

6
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,400
Sister Ya.

7
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:52,960
We're here.

8
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,040
You drove pretty fast.

9
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,400
If it weren't for the traffic,

10
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,200
we could've been even faster.

11
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,040
It's fine.

12
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,720
We just arrived too.

13
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,360
Let's skip the small talk.

14
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,160
Get to the point.

15
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,560
The victim is male.

16
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,520
The crime happened at nine last night.

17
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,760
Cause of death: throat slashed.

18
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,520
Xiao Yu just sent me

19
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,040
the details about the death.

20
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,480
His name is Xiang Huatao.

21
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,160
Forty-three years old.

22
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:11,960
Unemployed drifter.

23
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:12,800
No

24
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,360
criminal record.

25
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,480
His previous records

26
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,160
are all pretty normal.

27
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,280
These blood spatter marks—

28
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,480
throat cut from behind.

29
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,280
When the blood sprayed,

30
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,760
there was nothing blocking the front.

31
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,680
That's why the blood trail is continuous.

32
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,400
The wound is very clean.

33
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,760
The killer must've been decisive.

34
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,400
Also, judging by the depth,

35
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,080
the killer is more likely male.

36
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,720
That's more probable.

37
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,720
But for more details,

38
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,040
we need the autopsy report.

39
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,400
But something's odd.

40
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,080
Based on previous cases,

41
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,320
if the killer

42
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,720
attacked from behind,

43
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,080
the victim is usually stabbed in the back.

44
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,880
The attack should be downward.

45
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,680
A forceful stab.

46
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:52,880
Not a throat slash.

47
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,600
Think about it—

48
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,880
for someone

49
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,800
with no training

50
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,600
or experience,

51
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,160
choosing this method

52
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,080
wouldn't it be awkward?

53
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,080
About that—

54
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,880
I just discussed it with Li Ya.

55
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,680
We've already talked it over.

56
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,800
There's another issue.

57
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,680
This killer—

58
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,880
was it impulsive

59
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,600
or premeditated murder?

60
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,400
If it was premeditated,

61
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,880
he could've used a rope

62
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,880
to strangle the victim.

63
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,600
Or drugged him first.

64
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,960
No need to choose

65
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,080
this throat-slashing method.

66
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,520
But if it was impulsive,

67
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,600
like you said,

68
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,800
a downward

69
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,800
stab to the back is likelier.

70
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,400
That's more probable.

71
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,800
These blood drops

72
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,440
probably dripped

73
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,600
from the killer's knife.

74
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,160
Just a few drops.

75
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,520
Shows the killer

76
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,880
struck very quickly.

77
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:36,960
The blood from the wound

78
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,800
that sprayed out

79
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,040
didn't get on his hands at all.

80
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,600
Let alone his clothes.

81
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,640
At least for now,

82
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,200
I think

83
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,120
the killer came prepared.

84
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,840
He planned ahead—

85
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,680
the blood

86
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,520
mustn't get on his clothes.

87
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,360
That's why he chose

88
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,240
to circle behind and slash the throat.

89
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,680
So that means

90
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,400
this killer

91
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,080
is very likely

92
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,960
not a first-time offender.

93
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,280
Lieutenant Lu.

94
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,560
This was found under the pillow.

95
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,080
This killer

96
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,200
on the day of the crime

97
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,200
bought a box of condoms.

98
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,960
It's related to the killer.

99
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:19,760
I see.

100
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:20,640
Qi Lu,

101
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,520
you and Minmin

102
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,520
go to the property office

103
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,520
and ask about the victim.

104
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,680
Then go

105
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,760
to the security room

106
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,520
and get the surveillance footage.

107
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,080
Also,

108
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,200
visit this shop.

109
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:28,840
Check what's going on.

110
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,000
Li Ya and I

111
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,560
will finish checking the scene.

112
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,280
See you at the station.

113
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:31,680
Got it.

114
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,080
Lieutenant Lu,

115
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,960
this bottle of wine

116
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,760
shouldn't be here.

117
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,000
Why?

118
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,400
Because this wine

119
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,640
costs nearly ninety thousand yuan.

120
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:45,960
That's unusual.

121
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,400
Go quickly.

122
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,920
Ask thoroughly.

123
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:51,400
Let's go.

124
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:51,960
Go upstairs and take a look.

125
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,000
That's all the victim had.

126
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:06,800
Lieutenant Lu,

127
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,640
just a few seasons' worth.

128
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,680
He kept wearing this same outfit.

129
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:10,960
Look—

130
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,200
it's already worn out from washing.

131
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,520
Are you sure

132
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,920
the tenant and room number match?

133
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,000
This—

134
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:21,840
absolutely no mistake.

135
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,680
Every time we pay,

136
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,680
we check these forms.

137
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,120
To make sure the paid users

138
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,080
aren't mixed up.

139
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,920
Building Six, Room 204.

140
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,960
The person who registered the rental

141
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:30,800
was named Liu Dong.

142
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,680
Not Xiang Huatao.

143
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:33,520
So this person—

144
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,560
do you remember them?

145
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,920
This is Liu Dong.

146
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,640
The Liu Dong on the ID copy.

147
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,400
I actually haven't met him.

148
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,680
But every time someone paid or registered,

149
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,360
it was this person.

150
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,800
After you pay the property fee each time,

151
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,560
you sign, right?

152
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:48,680
Yes, yes.

153
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,240
We always sign.

154
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:51,960
Here.

155
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,000
Looks like the victim wasn't ordinary.

156
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:02,880
Thank you.

157
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:03,560
No problem.

158
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,880
The dates on these condiments

159
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,560
are pretty recent.

160
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,400
The vegetables in the fridge

161
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,120
are fresh too.

162
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,120
If Minmin hadn't found that bottle of wine,

163
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,120
judging by all this,

164
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,640
you'd think the victim lived well.

165
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,640
The victim's phone—

166
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,640
have we ever checked it?

167
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,200
I don't know.

168
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,320
I really don't know.

169
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,680
Honestly, I don't know.

170
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,120
I really don't know.

171
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,560
I don't know.

172
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,640
I really don't know.

173
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,760
Stop hitting me.

174
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,560
I don't know.

175
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:45,560
Come on.

176
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,120
Summary.

177
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,640
Minmin and I

178
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,080
checked the store's surveillance.

179
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,200
We also questioned the staff.

180
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,560
On the day of the crime,

181
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,680
the victim was alone

182
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,440
when he bought condoms.

183
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,200
There was nothing

184
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:54,680
else unusual.

185
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,440
But the property management

186
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,200
has a new discovery.

187
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,320
The person who rented this place

188
00:06:59,560 --> 00:06:59,960
is the tenant

189
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,560
named Liu Dong.

190
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,760
Here's a copy of his ID.

191
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,440
First, the photo on it

192
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,640
is clearly not Xiang Huatao.

193
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:06,560
Second,

194
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,680
Xiang Huatao

195
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,800
every time he paid the property fee,

196
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,520
signed a name

197
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,200
that wasn't his own,

198
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,000
but Liu Dong.

199
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,200
Lastly, the two characters Xiang Huatao signed

200
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,760
don't match the handwriting

201
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,760
on the contract at all.

202
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,400
Could Liu Dong

203
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,680
actually be a sublessor?

204
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,000
He rents the place first,

205
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,200
then sublets it to the victim.

206
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,120
Probably not.

207
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,400
If that's the case,

208
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,200
he could've just used his own name.

209
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,800
No need to pretend to be Liu Dong.

210
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,880
That's the problem.

211
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,200
This Liu Dong

212
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,000
is fake.

213
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,200
Fake.

214
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,120
Yes.

215
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,320
There's no such person in the system.

216
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,560
He probably used illegal means

217
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,520
to get a fake ID.

218
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,200
Xiang Huatao must've known

219
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,320
Liu Dong was fake.

220
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,640
It's even possible

221
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,560
that this fake Liu Dong

222
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,000
had Xiang Huatao rent the place for him.

223
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,000
He wanted

224
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,200
to hide his identity.

225
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,240
The photo is obviously AI-generated.

226
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,880
He doesn't even want to show his real face.

227
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,200
If that's the case,

228
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,320
it explains

229
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,320
why

230
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,400
Xiang Huatao signed as Liu Dong.

231
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,760
This Xiang Huatao

232
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,560
is said to have no criminal record,

233
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,080
but

234
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,240
is that just a front,

235
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,520
or is it real?

236
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,080
We need to investigate further.

237
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:08,760
Mm-hmm.

238
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,440
From the crime scene inspection,

239
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,560
Xiang Huatao's life

240
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,080
seems very frugal.

241
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,960
No unnecessary spending at home.

242
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,000
As for clothes,

243
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,440
just a few for changing.

244
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,400
But there's a bottle

245
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,320
of wine worth ninety thousand yuan.

246
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,400
The victim's phone—

247
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,200
have we

248
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,000
still not found it?

249
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,000
This case keeps getting more complicated.

250
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,680
We can reasonably suspect

251
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,120
the killer

252
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,440
was after the phone.

253
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,320
It's even possible

254
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,240
the phone is the reason

255
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,000
he was killed.

256
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,560
If that's true,

257
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,640
then this case

258
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,880
was to silence someone.

259
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,640
The key issue now is

260
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,880
we need to figure out

261
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,240
who Xiang Huatao

262
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,080
really was.

263
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:48,760
Or rather,

264
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,320
what kind of mess

265
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,240
he got dragged into.

266
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,560
On the day of the crime,

267
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,080
the victim bought condoms alone.

268
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,560
Definitely not for backup.

269
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,960
Probably for someone specific.

270
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,560
Brand new, unopened.

271
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,640
Hadn't been used yet.

272
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,320
So the person who had the victim buy

273
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,800
the condoms—

274
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,120
could that be the killer?

275
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,320
Xiao Yu.

276
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,440
Is the surveillance sorted?

277
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,440
Hold on.

278
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,080
Almost done.

279
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:13,760
By the way,

280
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,520
Sister Ya,

281
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,640
didn't you say last time

282
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,440
judging by the wound depth,

283
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,440
the killer

284
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,760
was likely a man?

285
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,880
Without evidence,

286
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,240
it's just speculation.

287
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,200
Not a conclusion.

288
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,960
A trained woman

289
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,960
could cause such a wound too.

290
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,120
Lieutenant Lu.

291
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,000
Surveillance is done.

292
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:29,760
Take a look.

293
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,760
This neighborhood is really old.

294
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,800
There’s no surveillance on the floors.

295
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,960
Only at the hallway entrance

296
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,640
is there a camera.

297
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,880
On the day of the crime,

298
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,880
besides the building’s residents,

299
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,320
only one man went in and out.

300
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,000
The time this man entered and left

301
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,080
matches the victim’s time of death.

302
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,000
I checked all the footage

303
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,640
from the ten days before the crime.

304
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,200
This person showed up only once.

305
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,080
Did you follow that street

306
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,880
and check the cameras backwards?

307
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,640
I did.

308
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,400
This person is very good at evading surveillance.

309
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,760
Their face is well covered.

310
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,640
And they only take side paths.

311
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,800
The cameras barely catch anything.

312
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,880
They vanish after a few steps.

313
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,120
Xiao Yu, play it again.

314
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,320
Don’t you think

315
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,920
when this person turned just now,

316
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,520
their figure looked like a woman’s?

317
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,040
Play it again.

318
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,160
It does look a bit like.

319
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:23,360
Qi Lu

320
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,120
Let’s go check it out together.

321
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,520
Send the footage to my phone.

322
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,040
Okay.

323
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:33,840
Boss.

324
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:35,760
Police?

325
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:36,760
Hello, officer.

326
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,160
Hello, officer.

327
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:37,720
No, thanks.

328
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,120
Smoke? Smoke? Smoke?

329
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:38,840
No, thanks.

330
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,520
Betel nut? Betel nut? Betel nut?

331
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,360
Really, no need.

332
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,120
Thank you, thank you.

333
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,000
No, that’s fine.

334
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,400
We’re here

335
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,920
just to ask you a few questions.

336
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,120
Don’t be nervous.

337
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,400
This is last night’s surveillance footage.

338
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,600
Take a look at the person in this video.

339
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,040
Is that you?

340
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,720
I didn’t do anything.

341
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,160
Officer,

342
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:52,880
I, I...

343
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,720
I didn’t do anything.

344
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,520
Don’t panic.

345
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,640
You almost bumped into this person.

346
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,760
We’re asking if you remember.

347
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:02,920
I remember.

348
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,000
That girl smelled really nice.

349
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,520
I glanced at her twice.

350
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,920
But I don’t know why

351
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,000
she was dressed like a boy.

352
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:16,760
Hello, Lieutenant Lu.

353
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:17,680
Hello, Xiao Yu.

354
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:18,760
Check again right away.

355
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,160
The person in the footage is a woman.

356
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,520
It’s likely the cameras didn’t miss her—

357
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,560
she was disguised as a man.

358
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,040
Okay.

359
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:23,640
No problem.
