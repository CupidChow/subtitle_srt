1
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,080
Can you check my eyes for me?

2
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,040
Petechial hemorrhage.

3
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,080
Okay.

4
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,560
Captain Lu.

5
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,520
These are all the surveillance
before the crime.

6
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,640
I just asked the property manager.

7
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,120
The tenant here is a woman.

8
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,040
Her name is Li Xiaofeng.

9
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,560
She owns a nail salon.

10
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,640
This apartment...

11
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,800
She only rented it three months ago.

12
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,880
Doing nails nowadays...

13
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,720
Is it really that profitable?

14
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,760
Such a big place...

15
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,320
Must cost a lot to rent.

16
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,160
What do you think?

17
00:01:59,360 --> 00:01:59,840
Qi Lu.

18
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,080
Oral cavity.

19
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:02,760
And airway.

20
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,680
No obvious signs of smoke.

21
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,400
Petechial hemorrhage
in the conjunctiva.

22
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,480
Preliminary assessment:

23
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,040
She was burned after death.

24
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,240
Homicide can't be ruled out.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,320
Cause of death: mechanical asphyxia.

26
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,400
For details,

27
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,840
wait for the autopsy report.

28
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,520
Murder first,

29
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,680
then arson.

30
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,120
Destroying the body
to cover it up.

31
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,160
What are they trying to hide?

32
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,200
Mm.

33
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,480
Alright, alright.

34
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,560
Got it.

35
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,000
Lao Ji said Li Xiaofeng
has a boyfriend.

36
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,720
But according to neighbors,

37
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,080
strangers often visit
Li Xiaofeng's home.

38
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,160
Strangers.

39
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,400
Frequently.

40
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,480
Is Li Xiaofeng involved
in other businesses?

41
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,680
Li Ya, check out
who Li Xiaofeng's boyfriend is.

42
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:37,320
Zhen Yu, focus on
Li Xiaofeng's WeChat for any odd contacts.

43
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,440
Qi Zi, look into
her social connections.

44
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,200
Also, check the community's surveillance.

45
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,960
See who those strangers are.

46
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,080
Alright.

47
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,760
After you're done, keep an eye
on the forensic report.

48
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,640
Xiao Yu, send me
the crime scene video.

49
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,880
Captain Lu, what about me?

50
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,840
This case was reported
by the sub-bureau.

51
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,960
The person in the footage
showed up at Huiyingju villa.

52
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,760
Go to Huiyingju, Qi Zi.

53
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,240
RONGCHENG POLICE AT YOUR SERVICE

54
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,680
Captain Lu.

55
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,920
We've found the victim's info.

56
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,280
Captain Lu.

57
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:34,560
Mm.

58
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,480
You and the victim upstairs—

59
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,880
What's your relationship?

60
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,240
He's my boyfriend.

61
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,280
What's his name?

62
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,440
Usually,

63
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,520
I just call him Mr. Sun.

64
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,200
And your so-called boyfriend—

65
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:51,800
His real name is

66
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,520
Wang Liuxi.

67
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,680
He's committed many petty crimes.

68
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,240
He was just released
after serving time.

69
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,920
I don't know.

70
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,280
I'm just his...

71
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,680
lover.

72
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,840
Just someone he uses.

73
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,000
Li Xiaofeng.

74
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,240
Do you know her?

75
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,320
It's fine.

76
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:27,640
Ah.

77
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,280
Here.

78
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,720
Have some more water.

79
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,240
Has the cause of death
been determined?

80
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,280
Preliminary assessment:

81
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,120
Back of the head was

82
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,120
struck by a blunt object.

83
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,480
No obvious wounds
on the body surface.

84
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,680
Has the murder weapon
been found?

85
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:40,720
That girl's...

86
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:41,680
Is it enough?

87
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,440
Doesn't look like it.

88
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,080
Just one hit—

89
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:46,840
the occipital bone shattered.

90
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,080
And at the scene,

91
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,520
we're searching for
similar weapons.

92
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,520
This place is huge—

93
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,640
still need to search.

94
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,400
Oh, right—

95
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,680
That Zhao Keyuan—

96
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,240
No traces found
on her hands.

97
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,120
No blood detected.

98
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,200
That's odd.

99
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,120
Now we've got ourselves

100
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,240
a locked-room murder, huh?

101
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,320
Mm.

102
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,000
It's okay.

103
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,360
Don't be afraid.

104
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:20,920
Summarize the situation.

105
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,240
Technical investigation is done.

106
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,560
On Wang Liuxi,

107
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,320
the hair we collected

108
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,320
wasn't just his own.

109
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,200
There was someone else's too.

110
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:27,880
Li Xiaofeng.

111
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:28,560
Right.

112
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,400
We took Wang Liuxi's photo

113
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,200
and asked Li Xiaofeng's neighbors
and friends.

114
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,400
What we can confirm is

115
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,560
he's the mysterious boyfriend
Lao Ji found.

116
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,440
He's that mysterious boyfriend.

117
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,440
And from his friends' descriptions,

118
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,960
Li Xiaofeng, like Zhao Keyuan,

119
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,520
was also kept by Wang Liuxi.

120
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,880
Have you checked Li Xiaofeng's
social connections?

121
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,680
I checked all her

122
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,320
communications.

123
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,200
Nothing unusual.

124
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,760
From the hallway cameras,

125
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:47,960
the strangers neighbors mentioned

126
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,000
who often came and went

127
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,000
were mostly Wang Liuxi's
former cellmates.

128
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,000
And some of them

129
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,080
had drug-related records.

130
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:54,840
Drug-related.

131
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:56,760
Captain Lu.

132
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,120
Actually,

133
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,760
that day in Zhao Keyuan's kitchen,

134
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,240
I smelled something strange.

135
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,400
It was faint.

136
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,320
Kind of like

137
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:04,760
chemicals.

138
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:05,680
Oh wow.

139
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,120
I hadn't even mentioned it yet.

140
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,080
Wang Liuxi's body

141
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,560
tested positive for Ketamine.

142
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,200
Good sense of smell.

143
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,080
Sharp observation too.

144
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,120
Really impressive.

145
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,200
Almost as good as our sniffer dog.

146
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,840
That nose works well.

147
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,240
You rascal.

148
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,440
Ignore him.

149
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,240
By the way, Captain Lu,

150
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,200
could it be that Wang Liuxi

151
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,320
was distributing drugs

152
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,440
and went too far,

153
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,200
accidentally killed someone?

154
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,640
That's possible.

155
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,120
If we think along those lines,

156
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,560
then Li Xiaofeng

157
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,680
was likely

158
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,440
when Wang Liuxi

159
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,120
was in some

160
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,080
extreme

161
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,440
state of confusion,

162
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,760
accidentally killed her.

163
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:41,880
After sobering up,

164
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,320
he tried to avoid responsibility

165
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,480
by burning the body.

166
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,560
There's another possibility.

167
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,360
Wang Liuxi wasn't just using drugs
with others.

168
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,240
He was dealing drugs.

169
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,080
Keeping many lovers was a cover.

170
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,480
He used the apartments he rented
for lovers

171
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,440
as drug stash houses.

172
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,320
Chen Minmin.

173
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,120
Li Ya.

174
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:55,920
You two go find

175
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,320
Zhao Keyuan.

176
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,320
She's lying.

177
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:58,800
Let's go.

178
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,160
Anyone here?

179
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,120
Li Ya.

180
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,080
Captain Lu.

181
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,160
How did the questioning go?

182
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:35,920
Zhao Keyuan harmed herself.

183
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,160
She's in the hospital now.

184
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,040
Self-harm.

185
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:39,840
Wait, I'll be right there.

186
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,960
I can't take it anymore.

187
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:45,360
I...

188
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,720
I really can't take it.

189
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,040
I cut my wrist.

190
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:50,600
Across.

191
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:51,920
No danger to life.

192
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,160
I never imagined

193
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,920
killing someone would feel like this.

194
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,280
I'm really

195
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,840
terrified.

196
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,160
It's okay.

197
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,240
Don't be scared.

198
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,280
You can take your time.

199
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,600
What exactly happened?

200
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,400
I was sleeping that night.

201
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,240
He came home and asked me for money.

202
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,600
I didn't know what was going on.

203
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,280
I didn't give him any.

204
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,520
Then he started

205
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,120
beating me for no reason.

206
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,720
I was totally confused.

207
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,840
I was afraid he'd kill me.

208
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,160
So I...

209
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,400
I pushed him hard.

210
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,520
I pushed him.

211
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:36,920
Then I just

212
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,520
didn't know anything.

213
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,720
I didn't know anything.

214
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,600
Didn't you ever think of leaving him?

215
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:44,400
I...

216
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,160
I did think about it.

217
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,040
But I was too scared.

218
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,520
He said he'd kill me.

219
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:55,960
Officer Li.

220
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,600
Please take me away.

221
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:58,280
I...

222
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,040
I'll admit everything.

223
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,280
I'll admit everything.

224
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,600
Do you remember

225
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,280
what you used to hit Wang Liuxi?

226
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,680
Was the weapon found at the scene?

227
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,600
Manslaughter.

228
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,360
Self-defense.

229
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,560
The weapon hasn't been found.

230
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,120
It's hard to say.

231
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:53,960
You're awake.

232
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,240
Have some water.

233
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,360
Does your hand still hurt?

234
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,640
Do you want to sleep a bit more?

235
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:01,840
Officer.

236
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,120
Can you call the nurse for me?

237
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,240
What's going on inside?

238
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,240
Just changed the dressing.

239
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,240
Ate something.

240
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,720
She's sleeping again.

241
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:30,960
Okay.

242
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,840
You go back with Li Ya.

243
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,600
I'll stay with Qi Lu.

244
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,120
Captain Lu.

245
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:34,960
Zhao Keyuan.

246
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,080
What will happen to her?

247
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,400
Sigh.

248
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,080
The case isn't closed yet.

249
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,000
Wang Liuxi is just twisted.

250
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,560
Not only did he get a girl killed,

251
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,840
he also beat Zhao Keyuan like this.

252
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,640
A scumbag this heartless—

253
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,760
even dying ten thousand times isn't enough.

254
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,600
We're here to solve the case.

255
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,480
Justice comes at the end.

256
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,440
Calm down.

257
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:57,960
In our line of work,

258
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,440
the worst is working while angry.

259
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:00,880
All right, all right.

260
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:02,560
Minmin.

261
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:02,960
Let's go.

262
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,560
Good job.

263
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:05,960
Get some rest early.

264
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,720
It's finally over, Minmin.

265
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,960
My whole body aches.

266
00:12:59,600 --> 00:12:59,960
Li Ya.

267
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,360
Where do you think the weapon is?

268
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,000
If it really was Zhao Keyuan,

269
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,840
it shouldn't be far.

270
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,240
But seeing the fatal wound—

271
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,480
do you think it was really her?

272
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,720
Let's wait until the scene is checked.

273
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,720
Then we'll go back and look again.

274
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,320
I'm heading back first, Minmin.

275
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:10,720
Okay.

276
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,280
What's wrong?

277
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:25,920
Call Li Ya.

278
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,080
Tell her to meet at Li Xiaofeng's place.

279
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,320
Lao Ji checked it out.

280
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:29,920
Wang Liuxi—

281
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,920
his recent source of funds.

282
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,520
Just as expected,

283
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,640
it overlaps with the drug squad.

284
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,240
This guy—

285
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,320
he really is selling to feed the habit.

286
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,480
The drug squad

287
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,640
was about to launch a big raid.

288
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:39,640
But then—

289
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,000
all those stash spots were empty.

290
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:41,840
They're still confused.

291
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,120
No idea who leaked the info.

292
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:43,480
So—

293
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,520
what does this have to do with our case?

294
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,800
Guess who runs those stash spots.

295
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,480
Who's the boss?

296
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,960
Wang Liuxi.

297
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,600
No way.

298
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,360
What a coincidence.

299
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,480
All these years,

300
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,320
he set up several

301
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,000
places like that.

302
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,000
On the surface,

303
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,080
he keeps a lover at each spot

304
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,680
as cover.

305
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,160
But they're really his storage warehouses.

306
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,440
Those unfamiliar visitors—

307
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,800
they're actually buyers.

308
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:01,680
So—

309
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,600
the case just changed.

310
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,200
Then why are we going

311
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,400
to Li Xiaofeng's place?

312
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,880
To re-examine the scene.

313
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,120
The drug squad

314
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,600
also

315
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,080
just got onto Wang Liuxi's trail.

316
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,840
But we beat them to it.

317
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,160
Multiple positive results.

318
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,680
All Ketamine.

319
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:23,920
Looks like a big amount.

320
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,680
The safe is empty.

321
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,200
But it tested positive too.

322
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,600
No wonder.

323
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,520
He was determined to kill and silence.
