1
00:02:10,417 --> 00:02:18,083
NIGHT FLIGHT

2
00:02:35,917 --> 00:02:37,208
Not again!

3
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,999
Stop taking pictures of your pretty mom
like a paparazzi.

4
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,999
Blame it on your beauty, mom.

5
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,583
I know, but...

6
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:49,625
I'm starving.

7
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:51,375
Say, "please."

8
00:02:51,376 --> 00:02:53,375
Please, Mom. $10?

9
00:02:54,292 --> 00:02:56,042
Am I your bank, kiddo?

10
00:02:58,208 --> 00:02:59,792
I'll be late today.

11
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:02,083
Buy yourself dinner with this.

12
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:03,458
Again?

13
00:03:04,917 --> 00:03:07,250
To prepare for the housing exams.

14
00:03:08,917 --> 00:03:10,458
I'm sleepy already

15
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,208
Are you jealous?

16
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,083
You like him that much?

17
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,083
You said he was so-so

18
00:03:19,792 --> 00:03:22,957
Is love a guy's dick
turning big or small?

19
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:25,083
Jeez, Mom...!

20
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,374
Hey, Juju! Let's go.

21
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:28,791
Hey, Gigi!

22
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:32,874
Didn't I tell you to stop
calling my precious son "Juju"?

23
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,124
Ditto that.

24
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:36,499
But you keep calling me Gigi.

25
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,500
"Gigi" and Guitar, big difference!

26
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,666
I can call him whatever I like.

27
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:43,666
What? Stay right there.

28
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:45,167
I'm going after you!

29
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,042
See you later, Mom!

30
00:03:49,167 --> 00:03:51,292
I'll let you go today, cutie.

31
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,083
Thank you, ma'am.

32
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,457
See you later, Mom!

33
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,624
Eat properly! Don't eat ramen boodles!

34
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:58,875
Wait for me!

35
00:04:07,542 --> 00:04:08,958
I'll go nuts.

36
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:10,957
Mama says report.

37
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,458
Wow, scary.

38
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,208
Damn

39
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,542
How will I survive the next semester?

40
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,582
Won't there be a war?

41
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,375
One's in my stomach.

42
00:04:28,417 --> 00:04:29,708
How about ramen noodles?

43
00:04:30,542 --> 00:04:32,791
Fish balls, 70, topokki, 280,

44
00:04:32,792 --> 00:04:34,332
Dumplings, 400.

45
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:37,416
And ramen is 800 kcal.

46
00:04:37,417 --> 00:04:39,042
You kind bastard.

47
00:04:39,792 --> 00:04:41,833
And why'd I eat ramen with you?

48
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:45,042
How about a tteok ramen then?

49
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,375
The break is almost over.

50
00:05:36,292 --> 00:05:37,417
Will you...

51
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,375
Come to school?

52
00:05:45,542 --> 00:05:46,750
Your phone number's...

53
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:49,792
Changed.

54
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,333
Tteok ramen, please.

55
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,750
No, dumpling ramen.

56
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:25,874
Stop hogging chocolates, Porky.

57
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,208
Stop that, Juju!

58
00:06:28,542 --> 00:06:34,792
The meaning in this sentence is...

59
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:38,292
I talk, you sleep.

60
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:43,583
You're in class, huh?

61
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:46,500
At least have your books open.

62
00:06:46,792 --> 00:06:49,083
Saved by the bell.

63
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:54,208
Don't get all excited
cuz its new semester.

64
00:06:55,542 --> 00:06:59,374
One-on-one about your scours
start next week.

65
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,458
Be prepared.

66
00:07:09,042 --> 00:07:11,417
Why is the student director
so into that?

67
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:19,542
Will this really help sexually?

68
00:07:20,417 --> 00:07:22,249
Heard he takes eel extracts, too.

69
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,250
Really?

70
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,958
It only gives me cramps.

71
00:07:28,792 --> 00:07:32,042
Guys would think
you don't have lunch money.

72
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,333
Get lost. I'm on a diet.

73
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,750
Like hell you'll lose weight.

74
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,625
Reading that again?

75
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,250
Boring bastards like you
wouldn't know the world of otaku.

76
00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:49,583
The final episode is out next week.

77
00:07:50,167 --> 00:07:53,708
I need to read it over again 10 times
until then.

78
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:55,625
That fun?

79
00:07:57,042 --> 00:07:58,333
Like hell.

80
00:07:59,167 --> 00:08:01,127
Gaia, the main character,
completely lost control.

81
00:08:01,792 --> 00:08:04,000
She's about to wipe them out.

82
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,083
Cheap bastard!

83
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:17,042
Wanna go to the Silkworm Isle.

84
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,000
Even if it's just us?

85
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:56,333
No one within 300m as usual.

86
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,208
See?

87
00:09:00,542 --> 00:09:04,958
Just us two from my school and yours.

88
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:15,208
Who would dare to turn on
the gay app at school?

89
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,125
We met through this, remember?

90
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,417
I've kept it on for 6 months,

91
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:26,833
And there's just us.

92
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,417
There might be more.

93
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:37,208
Who else is there?

94
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:40,583
It's just us.

95
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:50,458
Know what?

96
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:57,125
They say when you lie,
your nose gets warm.

97
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,750
You have a crush on someone, right?

98
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,125
Get lost.

99
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:11,833
Go and study.

100
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:37,375
Ove, you asshole

101
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:40,708
Over here! Quick!

102
00:10:49,292 --> 00:10:50,000
Hey! Hey!

103
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Buzz off!

104
00:10:53,792 --> 00:10:54,792
You fucking bastard!

105
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:56,417
Stop right there!

106
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:58,625
Hey!

107
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,458
Stop!

108
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,500
Get him!

109
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,333
Hurry up!

110
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:12,792
Han Gi-woong!

111
00:11:15,792 --> 00:11:17,167
Where the hell did he go?

112
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,792
Come out, you shit!

113
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,083
Hey!

114
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,667
Han Gi-woong!

115
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,208
Hey!

116
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,624
Where are you hiding like a rat?

117
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:51,957
Come on out!

118
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,625
Come out!

119
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:07,458
Give it back.

120
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:09,958
I'll shout.

121
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:28,167
Damn you freaking shit.

122
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,583
Damn thief.

123
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:48,958
Does it hurt?

124
00:12:51,417 --> 00:12:53,125
Hurts, huh?

125
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:57,458
You took it,

126
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:02,458
but I'm taking it back.

127
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:26,833
Gi-woong!

128
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,625
Han Gi-woong!

129
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,375
Gi-woong!

130
00:13:47,792 --> 00:13:49,167
Han Gi-woong!

131
00:13:58,417 --> 00:13:59,708
Han Gi-woong!

132
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:08,708
Where is it?

133
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,708
Where is it, I say!

134
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,250
Give me my bike

135
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,625
or ill report this hires minors.

136
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:25,375
What did you just say, asshole?

137
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:28,667
You little!

138
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,167
I'll get going.

139
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,500
Hey, you shithead!

140
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:36,417
Who's that small fry?

141
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,250
You prick!

142
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,792
Told you not to smoke
in front of the shop.

143
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,375
He's not at the cheap dorms, either?

144
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,250
Ow, that stings. Freaking mosquitos.

145
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:12,625
See you later, boss.

146
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,082
Take your flip-flop, you idiots.

147
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,125
Yes, sir!

148
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,875
Why are you looking for him?

149
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,958
Said he was released 3 months ago.

150
00:16:25,917 --> 00:16:26,917
Just...

151
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,833
Just, my ass.

152
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:32,500
It's all out of your wage.

153
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,083
Who the hell is he?

154
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:44,125
You nailed lip bastard.

155
00:16:45,292 --> 00:16:46,917
Just wait few more days.

156
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,417
Fuck, get the phone!

157
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,583
I made breakfast, so eat before you go.

158
00:17:41,542 --> 00:17:43,458
You should attend school.

159
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,417
We're moving next month.

160
00:18:38,542 --> 00:18:41,416
These idiots tried to
lynch Gi-woong on Saturday.

161
00:18:41,417 --> 00:18:46,541
Heard one of them went to ER scalded
by ramen.

162
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,499
If I had my hands on those shitheads.

163
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:52,582
Stupid assholes bandaged
like a freaking mummy.

164
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,292
Hey, punching machine!

165
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,875
Guten morgen!

166
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:08,583
Good morning!

167
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,792
Good morning, you shit.

168
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:14,583
Good morning.

169
00:19:18,917 --> 00:19:20,083
Wanna smoke?

170
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,750
You paid for it.

171
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,166
Then again, you shouldn't.

172
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:31,375
We don't want you broken.

173
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:38,208
You know,
Yong-ju here was looking around for you.

174
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:43,000
Yeah, I sold off his bike.

175
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,374
What? He had an expensive one.

176
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:48,417
How much did you get?

177
00:19:49,042 --> 00:19:52,625
Wash it clean, you bastard!

178
00:20:02,417 --> 00:20:03,875
Wasn't Gi-woong...

179
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,792
Just a dickhead in junior high?

180
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:09,750
His dad...

181
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:13,125
You know what they mean by

182
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,750
a punching machine?

183
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,958
How the fuck up would I know?

184
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:24,625
Hey, Yong-ju!

185
00:20:24,917 --> 00:20:26,125
Shin Yong-ju.

186
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,500
Answer your goddamn phone!

187
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,208
One-on-one! It's your turn.

188
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:01,542
Yong-ju

189
00:21:02,292 --> 00:21:03,833
You're in grade tier1,

190
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,917
but your recent scores are a bit risky.

191
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:09,583
You know we're creating an honors class
next week, right?

192
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,707
To focus on English and Math,

193
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,249
so let's raise your scores a bit.

194
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,333
Sir.

195
00:21:18,167 --> 00:21:21,417
Why? You have something to say?

196
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,583
Haven't had lunch?

197
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:29,958
A friend is...

198
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,458
being bullied.

199
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:48,208
There's no time for friends now.

200
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,500
Just study.

201
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:56,333
Get back.

202
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,708
Why are you taking pictures?

203
00:22:33,958 --> 00:22:37,333
Did I mention
that this used to be a gay bar?

204
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,292
It got reported coz it's near a school.

205
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:48,500
Why did they build it
in such a high place?

206
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:50,458
Have you...

207
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:54,375
met a straight before?

208
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:56,458
Why?

209
00:22:58,833 --> 00:23:00,333
Just curious...

210
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,875
How would the bitches know
if they are straight?

211
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:10,375
Coz they have girlfriends.

212
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:13,375
How would they know
until they've slept with me?

213
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:18,458
Do they know how I taste?

214
00:23:18,917 --> 00:23:20,458
A taste of me?

215
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:50,083
So, there really is someone...

216
00:23:56,542 --> 00:23:57,792
Did you confess?

217
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:02,542
Don't

218
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:05,500
Ever confess

219
00:24:06,917 --> 00:24:08,167
If he'd puke.

220
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:12,375
Having crushes on a straight is

221
00:24:13,917 --> 00:24:15,708
like taking rat poison.

222
00:24:16,917 --> 00:24:17,917
Get it?

223
00:25:06,042 --> 00:25:07,500
You know how much it was?

224
00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:13,250
It was$225 with VAT.

225
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,999
Shit, you know your IQ drops
when you get hit?

226
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,291
Goes down by 1.6!

227
00:25:20,292 --> 00:25:22,542
And adolescence is an important time.

228
00:25:23,542 --> 00:25:26,375
It's just you now. I'm not scared.

229
00:25:26,708 --> 00:25:27,708
Give it!

230
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,958
Hey! Give it!

231
00:25:33,583 --> 00:25:35,708
Give me my bike back.

232
00:25:36,292 --> 00:25:38,083
Or I'll report

233
00:25:38,542 --> 00:25:41,083
You're working against
the Juvenile Protection law.

234
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,750
I know your phone number now.

235
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,250
Give me back!

236
00:25:49,792 --> 00:25:53,917
I will not go until you return it.

237
00:25:55,458 --> 00:25:56,708
Hey!

238
00:27:01,792 --> 00:27:03,292
And give me 50 cents.

239
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:09,875
You haven't paid back.

240
00:27:10,958 --> 00:27:12,125
Did you...

241
00:27:15,458 --> 00:27:16,917
really sell it?

242
00:27:19,042 --> 00:27:20,417
Did you sell it off?

243
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:08,958
The place looks expensive.

244
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:11,250
Did you really sell it here?

245
00:28:21,583 --> 00:28:22,625
Isn't this it?

246
00:28:23,792 --> 00:28:24,916
No.

247
00:28:24,917 --> 00:28:26,333
Fuck, choose whatever!

248
00:28:28,042 --> 00:28:29,042
Who's there?

249
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,083
Stop there!

250
00:28:32,042 --> 00:28:33,667
Wait for me!　-Who is it?!

251
00:28:54,167 --> 00:28:55,417
You look old now.

252
00:28:59,917 --> 00:29:01,792
You didn't smoke in junior high.

253
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:12,583
Still make gliders?

254
00:29:16,667 --> 00:29:18,333
Was it summer?

255
00:29:19,208 --> 00:29:24,042
You borrowed 50 cents from me
to buy glue for its wings.

256
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:28,958
Said you'd pay back after the mid-terms.

257
00:29:33,375 --> 00:29:34,625
You have a cut on your arm...

258
00:29:36,417 --> 00:29:38,583
From the bike shop, I guess.

259
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,375
What?

260
00:29:47,542 --> 00:29:48,583
Wait up!

261
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:51,208
What about my bike?

262
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:53,125
Be responsible.

263
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:55,875
We didn't get to steal one.

264
00:30:00,042 --> 00:30:01,792
Why do you keep following me?

265
00:30:02,458 --> 00:30:06,375
You stole my bike.

266
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,125
No...

267
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:11,000
why do you keep sneaking at me?

268
00:30:14,833 --> 00:30:19,792
Since junior high,
why do you keep sneaking at me?

269
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:29,875
Don't tell ...anyone.

270
00:32:01,292 --> 00:32:03,167
Get up when I ask you nicely.

271
00:32:04,375 --> 00:32:07,667
Can I take a day off? I'm sick.

272
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:09,792
No, you're not.

273
00:32:10,167 --> 00:32:12,458
You were like this yesterday.

274
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,500
Get up.

275
00:32:16,292 --> 00:32:17,583
Get up!

276
00:32:33,208 --> 00:32:35,125
Are you becoming defiant coz of me?

277
00:32:36,042 --> 00:32:37,625
What's now?

278
00:32:38,917 --> 00:32:41,417
Are you jealous of the man I'm seeing?

279
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,625
It's not even the first time.

280
00:32:49,625 --> 00:32:52,292
Did you know that IQ drops
when you get hit?

281
00:32:54,625 --> 00:32:56,416
And where is your bike?

282
00:32:56,417 --> 00:32:58,208
Lent it to Gi-taek.

283
00:32:58,625 --> 00:33:01,707
You lend it out for 2 weeks,
while you walk?

284
00:33:01,708 --> 00:33:03,292
Told you, it broke.

285
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:13,583
My God!

286
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:17,542
Is this like a voodoo thing?

287
00:33:19,792 --> 00:33:21,042
It must hurt

288
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:30,041
Is this from school violence on TV
these days?

289
00:33:30,042 --> 00:33:31,417
It's not!

290
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,624
Then why are you like this?

291
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:36,291
Hardly talking...

292
00:33:36,292 --> 00:33:38,542
Just leave me alone!

293
00:33:40,458 --> 00:33:42,583
Acting like a refugee in winter!

294
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,208
Your kid is your worst enemy.

295
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,083
Hey, refugee!

296
00:33:52,542 --> 00:33:54,125
He bought it for you.

297
00:33:54,667 --> 00:33:56,083
Its brand-new.

298
00:34:09,208 --> 00:34:10,208
Hey, kiddo!

299
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:13,250
Aren't you gonna wish me luck
for my exam today?

300
00:34:14,875 --> 00:34:16,625
You kind bastard!

301
00:34:18,958 --> 00:34:20,625
Come grab some cake later.

302
00:34:33,292 --> 00:34:34,292
Social mobility means

303
00:34:34,293 --> 00:34:37,917
individuals or groups
in social position...

304
00:34:49,042 --> 00:34:50,708
Minus 2 points, you shit.

305
00:34:51,542 --> 00:34:53,500
In light speed, huh?

306
00:34:55,375 --> 00:34:57,250
To minus infinity and beyond?

307
00:35:02,208 --> 00:35:03,542
Look at this bastard...!

308
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,874
Get out! Get out!

309
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:13,417
Get out of my class!

310
00:35:17,542 --> 00:35:19,458
Get your ass in the teachers' room
after class!

311
00:35:20,833 --> 00:35:23,375
Just because of the fuss
on Student Rights Ordinance,

312
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:26,000
You all think I won't hit you?

313
00:35:30,958 --> 00:35:32,667
What are human rights to student?

314
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,750
Isn't studying what matters?

315
00:35:37,625 --> 00:35:39,292
I'll say this again.

316
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:42,458
Students in grade tiers 1-3
will end up ordering chicken,

317
00:35:43,917 --> 00:35:45,666
Repeat after me! Order...!

318
00:35:45,667 --> 00:35:46,833
Order!

319
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:48,541
Those in tiers 4-6...

320
00:35:48,542 --> 00:35:50,332
will fry the chicken!

321
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:51,957
Those in tiers7-9

322
00:35:51,958 --> 00:35:53,667
will deliver the chicken!

323
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:58,833
Your scores went up, didn't it?

324
00:35:59,833 --> 00:36:01,167
Shit,

325
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,375
Mine went down by 5 points.

326
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:16,917
Don't hand around with
that fat bitch friend of yours.

327
00:36:19,958 --> 00:36:22,125
You show your weakness at school
and you're dead.

328
00:36:27,667 --> 00:36:29,292
He's not on our level.

329
00:36:38,333 --> 00:36:40,332
And don't mess with Gi-woong, either.

330
00:36:40,333 --> 00:36:41,375
You'll get hurt.

331
00:36:42,958 --> 00:36:44,708
You won't find that bike.

332
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:50,875
What if I do?

333
00:36:55,917 --> 00:36:58,000
I'll piggyback you every day,
fucking bastard.

334
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:02,000
Guess you don't know shit
about Gi-woong...

335
00:37:05,042 --> 00:37:06,875
Man, you OK?

336
00:37:07,375 --> 00:37:09,184
Fuck, the student director going berserk
in the morning.

337
00:37:09,208 --> 00:37:11,792
The son of a bitch!

338
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:18,250
Must be true he can't get his dick up.

339
00:37:19,125 --> 00:37:21,708
He was doing this shit again.

340
00:37:22,125 --> 00:37:24,332
Always sucking on eel extracts.

341
00:37:24,333 --> 00:37:26,500
I saw him piss in the bathroom.

342
00:37:27,417 --> 00:37:29,707
His dick is this small.

343
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:31,583
Thought it was a mosquito dick.

344
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:33,292
Come here.

345
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:35,833
Run over, you fucking bastard.

346
00:37:38,625 --> 00:37:42,417
You asshole,
I told you not to wear high heeled shoes.

347
00:37:47,708 --> 00:37:49,000
Hey, want a cig?

348
00:37:51,167 --> 00:37:52,125
No.

349
00:37:52,126 --> 00:37:57,249
Fuck you, god damn punching machine,
try one.

350
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:59,000
Just get lost, dickhead.

351
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,042
Who's a dickhead?

352
00:38:03,417 --> 00:38:05,375
Crazy bastard!

353
00:38:07,292 --> 00:38:08,542
Just fuck off.

354
00:38:10,875 --> 00:38:13,332
Who cried in the schoolyard?

355
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:14,333
Shut up!

356
00:38:17,042 --> 00:38:18,542
Get out, you asshole!

357
00:38:22,417 --> 00:38:23,417
Gi-taek!

358
00:38:27,208 --> 00:38:28,374
Gi-taek!　-Get out!

359
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:29,375
Get that camera!

360
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Gi-taek!

361
00:38:35,792 --> 00:38:36,792
Gi-taek!

362
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:54,292
Shut the door.

363
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,000
Shut the door, I say!

364
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:23,624
See Seong-jin's mom herding others
like a pig?

365
00:39:23,625 --> 00:39:25,292
They call her, "Pig Mom."

366
00:39:26,875 --> 00:39:28,624
Teachers and parents obey her coz

367
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:30,750
she has connections
to elite universities.

368
00:39:32,375 --> 00:39:34,250
Gi-taek is the victim since

369
00:39:34,667 --> 00:39:37,667
Everyone will just cover this up.

370
00:39:39,125 --> 00:39:40,667
Even his own mom.

371
00:39:42,167 --> 00:39:44,667
Seong-jin will probably
just get community service again.

372
00:39:59,083 --> 00:40:00,167
Damn bastard!

373
00:40:01,042 --> 00:40:02,042
How many points?

374
00:40:05,125 --> 00:40:06,166
75points.

375
00:40:06,167 --> 00:40:06,833
What?

376
00:40:06,834 --> 00:40:11,458
You can't feel
the impact coz of the fat?

377
00:40:12,333 --> 00:40:14,250
Shit, I'll tell Grandma on you...!

378
00:40:21,292 --> 00:40:22,458
What's my score?

379
00:40:26,167 --> 00:40:27,250
85 points.

380
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,833
Fuck.

381
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,208
Only 85 points?

382
00:40:34,209 --> 00:40:36,833
It won't get Seong-jin
in Seoul University.

383
00:40:37,167 --> 00:40:40,042
You bastard,
I need 95 to be in grade tier 1.

384
00:40:40,625 --> 00:40:43,625
Let's send Seong-jin to college,
you bastard.

385
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:46,667
How dare you rat on me.

386
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:52,333
How many points?

387
00:40:52,625 --> 00:40:53,750
What's he doing here?

388
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:55,583
Hey, you!

389
00:40:55,958 --> 00:40:57,750
Who told you to come here?

390
00:40:58,042 --> 00:40:59,417
What are you doing here?

391
00:41:01,833 --> 00:41:03,666
Freaking bastard,

392
00:41:03,667 --> 00:41:04,957
you wanna die?　-Let go!

393
00:41:04,958 --> 00:41:07,166
You think you're something, huh?

394
00:41:07,167 --> 00:41:08,042
Leave him alone.

395
00:41:08,043 --> 00:41:10,625
Told you not to hand around here!

396
00:41:11,333 --> 00:41:13,875
You want to be the punching machine too?

397
00:41:14,583 --> 00:41:16,292
Shut up and get lost, all of you!

398
00:41:20,833 --> 00:41:21,833
Can't hear me?

399
00:41:23,542 --> 00:41:25,333
Fuck, get out, everyone!

400
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,500
Let's go.

401
00:41:52,542 --> 00:41:53,583
Hit me!

402
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:56,249
Hit me with this.

403
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,792
I'll give you 100 points.

404
00:41:58,125 --> 00:42:01,583
Hit me with real thing!

405
00:42:03,292 --> 00:42:05,000
We're... friends, aren't we?

406
00:42:07,542 --> 00:42:08,624
Remember we used to...

407
00:42:08,625 --> 00:42:09,833
Shut up!

408
00:42:35,333 --> 00:42:36,833
The kid who died last year...

409
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:43,625
Before jumping off the roof,
he was in the elevator like this.

410
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,333
I told mom about him.

411
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:52,125
And you know what she said?

412
00:42:54,958 --> 00:42:57,042
"Did he get good grades?"

413
00:43:01,708 --> 00:43:03,250
The final episode of Gaia.

414
00:43:04,417 --> 00:43:06,042
It wasn't a happy ending.

415
00:43:08,667 --> 00:43:11,000
The main character dies like a fool.

416
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:17,000
If the world is this shitty.

417
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:20,917
Shouldn't the ending be happy?

418
00:43:23,125 --> 00:43:25,333
What have we done so wrong...

419
00:43:28,583 --> 00:43:31,000
That we can't even laugh at the end?

420
00:43:33,625 --> 00:43:36,542
It means we should laugh at least
since the world is shitty.

421
00:43:37,667 --> 00:43:39,625
Bad guys don't laugh.

422
00:43:40,958 --> 00:43:42,583
So we should.

423
00:43:43,625 --> 00:43:45,333
Shouldn't we, fatso?

424
00:43:45,625 --> 00:43:46,917
Stop crying.

425
00:43:49,167 --> 00:43:50,583
Stop.

426
00:43:52,667 --> 00:43:54,125
It's alright.

427
00:44:01,167 --> 00:44:02,167
Hush!

428
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,125
Did you call the boys?

429
00:44:56,333 --> 00:44:57,917
It's another kid from Ilsin High.

430
00:45:02,958 --> 00:45:05,333
The kid we've been asked
to protect is Gyeong-sik.

431
00:45:06,167 --> 00:45:08,042
His parents are really concerned.

432
00:45:08,958 --> 00:45:10,249
The police must be lousy

433
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:11,917
Since we get all these jobs.

434
00:45:14,417 --> 00:45:17,750
Keep it as your wage, kid.

435
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,083
Right?

436
00:45:24,208 --> 00:45:26,368
You'll find him soon,
since the boys are out searching.

437
00:45:28,542 --> 00:45:30,667
Your life is pretty shitty, too.

438
00:45:32,458 --> 00:45:33,541
See you, sir.

439
00:45:33,542 --> 00:45:35,375
Talk to him nicely.

440
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:10,958
Smile.

441
00:46:12,042 --> 00:46:13,708
Smile, you shit!

442
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:18,125
You need to keep
that smile on your ugly faces,

443
00:46:23,042 --> 00:46:25,667
If you so much as touch Gyeong-sik,

444
00:46:26,625 --> 00:46:28,000
I'll kill you...

445
00:46:30,583 --> 00:46:34,208
If you go near him, I'll kill you.

446
00:46:37,042 --> 00:46:38,708
If you report to the police.

447
00:46:40,208 --> 00:46:42,250
I'll stab you mother.

448
00:47:02,875 --> 00:47:04,625
Sophomore at Ilsin High.

449
00:47:05,208 --> 00:47:06,542
Kim Jin-seok.

450
00:47:07,583 --> 00:47:09,667
Don't pick on your friends...

451
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:12,457
Aren't you going to answer me?

452
00:47:12,458 --> 00:47:13,583
Yes.

453
00:47:14,458 --> 00:47:16,333
Let's never meet again...

454
00:47:17,208 --> 00:47:18,417
Beat it!

455
00:47:19,625 --> 00:47:21,375
Live right, you bastards.

456
00:47:22,917 --> 00:47:24,083
See you tomorrow.

457
00:47:25,875 --> 00:47:26,875
See ya.

458
00:47:47,292 --> 00:47:48,707
You'll definitely pass.

459
00:47:48,708 --> 00:47:53,374
I think I made it. But just barely.

460
00:47:53,375 --> 00:47:54,375
Congratulations.

461
00:48:28,583 --> 00:48:29,833
Delivery.

462
00:48:34,125 --> 00:48:35,500
Delivery!

463
00:48:43,792 --> 00:48:46,458
The money is inside.

464
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,250
Or you can go if you want.

465
00:48:59,917 --> 00:49:01,417
Do you know how late you are?

466
00:49:03,167 --> 00:49:05,083
I should make a complaint.

467
00:49:13,792 --> 00:49:15,667
My wallet's inside.

468
00:49:25,583 --> 00:49:27,333
What a shitty service.

469
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,417
It that how you're trained?

470
00:49:35,208 --> 00:49:36,292
Eat.

471
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:39,458
I'll pay you then.

472
00:49:58,583 --> 00:50:00,500
Eat up the crusts too.

473
00:51:10,375 --> 00:51:11,500
I got your name...

474
00:51:14,125 --> 00:51:15,792
Back then.

475
00:52:25,833 --> 00:52:27,000
I'm Shin Yong-ju.

476
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,042
Han Gi-woong.

477
00:53:23,417 --> 00:53:25,000
Don't know about the others,

478
00:53:26,375 --> 00:53:27,708
but you don't scare me.

479
00:53:33,917 --> 00:53:35,333
I still have this.

480
00:53:41,333 --> 00:53:42,417
Don't worry.

481
00:53:43,875 --> 00:53:45,292
Have them on digital files...

482
00:53:48,583 --> 00:53:49,958
You like me?

483
00:53:52,417 --> 00:53:53,667
Crazy bastard.

484
00:54:00,708 --> 00:54:02,667
Don't you come near me.

485
00:54:03,917 --> 00:54:04,917
I'll kill you.

486
00:54:42,875 --> 00:54:44,000
Han Gi-woong

487
00:54:52,583 --> 00:54:53,917
Take this.

488
01:00:42,792 --> 01:00:44,208
Just like old days.

489
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:47,250
Just like then.

490
01:00:53,625 --> 01:00:54,792
Know what?

491
01:00:57,208 --> 01:01:00,958
When Mongolians like someone, they say

492
01:01:01,542 --> 01:01:04,542
"Let's go to the mountain together."

493
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,625
And skimo's says,

494
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:14,750
"Let's laugh together."

495
01:01:18,083 --> 01:01:19,583
Its corny.

496
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:25,250
But, isn't it nice and short?

497
01:01:32,833 --> 01:01:37,083
But then,
you don't even know how to smile.

498
01:02:02,792 --> 01:02:04,167
Thanks...

499
01:02:06,958 --> 01:02:08,500
For coming with me.

500
01:02:13,958 --> 01:02:23,375
Is she your girlfriend?

501
01:04:12,125 --> 01:04:13,333
Gi-woong!

502
01:04:15,125 --> 01:04:16,458
Han Gi-woong!

503
01:04:32,417 --> 01:04:34,000
Okay, I'll call you back.

504
01:04:35,042 --> 01:04:37,000
I will!

505
01:04:39,333 --> 01:04:40,667
Why are you so late?

506
01:04:52,917 --> 01:04:54,041
Why didn't you turn on the light?

507
01:04:54,042 --> 01:04:55,291
Don't turn it on.

508
01:04:55,292 --> 01:04:56,375
Why not?

509
01:04:57,833 --> 01:04:59,750
Just leave it and get out!

510
01:05:00,667 --> 01:05:02,583
Why are you telling?

511
01:05:03,583 --> 01:05:06,375
Your words are thorny these days.

512
01:05:08,167 --> 01:05:10,208
What is the matter with you.

513
01:05:10,917 --> 01:05:12,667
Talk, for goodness' sake.

514
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:17,375
My situation is enough of a thriller
as it is.

515
01:05:18,167 --> 01:05:20,791
Do you tell me everything?

516
01:05:20,792 --> 01:05:23,083
You live the way you want.

517
01:05:26,167 --> 01:05:27,542
What did I say?

518
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:31,708
You can live your live
the way you want it.

519
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:05,292
You must be going through puberty again.

520
01:06:06,167 --> 01:06:07,833
That's shitty.

521
01:06:08,917 --> 01:06:10,583
Better than menopause.

522
01:06:13,292 --> 01:06:14,917
What would you know...

523
01:06:17,375 --> 01:06:19,500
You think flowers only bloom is spring?

524
01:06:21,083 --> 01:06:22,750
They bloom in autumn, too.

525
01:06:38,208 --> 01:06:39,916
Jin-gi.　-Yes.

526
01:06:39,917 --> 01:06:41,000
Han Gi-woong.

527
01:06:41,958 --> 01:06:43,500
Absent again?

528
01:06:46,208 --> 01:06:47,708
It's the fourth day already.

529
01:06:48,667 --> 01:06:49,583
Class president.

530
01:06:49,583 --> 01:06:50,542
Yes, sir.

531
01:06:50,543 --> 01:06:51,875
Contact him.

532
01:06:52,542 --> 01:06:54,208
One more absence and he's expelled.

533
01:06:54,583 --> 01:06:57,750
Absence counts as 2 points.
Don't miss school.

534
01:06:59,375 --> 01:07:02,749
You all know about the honors class
that starts today, huh?

535
01:07:02,750 --> 01:07:04,125
Yes!

536
01:07:04,542 --> 01:07:06,667
Those of you in the honors
go to classroom2.

537
01:07:08,167 --> 01:07:10,582
It's based on your grades.

538
01:07:10,583 --> 01:07:11,625
You think it's unfair?

539
01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:14,958
Then study.

540
01:07:16,417 --> 01:07:17,708
OK, get moving.

541
01:07:25,667 --> 01:07:27,458
It's like an exodus.

542
01:07:29,083 --> 01:07:31,125
Is this a wrecked ship?

543
01:07:53,958 --> 01:07:54,542
Aren't you going?

544
01:07:54,543 --> 01:07:56,125
I'm coming.

545
01:09:50,375 --> 01:09:52,292
What's with that jerk now?

546
01:09:58,458 --> 01:09:59,625
What's the matter?

547
01:10:00,583 --> 01:10:01,583
Jeez!

548
01:10:03,792 --> 01:10:05,167
You really wanna do it?

549
01:10:15,375 --> 01:10:17,167
Told you not to take rat poison.

550
01:10:20,417 --> 01:10:22,125
Think I don't have any pride?

551
01:10:28,167 --> 01:10:29,750
So, did the bastard...

552
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:32,208
Puke when you confessed?

553
01:10:42,292 --> 01:10:44,083
Don't do it if you're not confident.

554
01:10:44,625 --> 01:10:46,292
Watch out for rumors.

555
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,083
Am I some toy to you?

556
01:10:53,667 --> 01:10:55,000
I'm transferring...

557
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:10,042
Mom says she'll die of shame.

558
01:11:12,458 --> 01:11:14,083
Wants me to transfer far away.

559
01:11:15,667 --> 01:11:20,333
My teacher ratted on me to Mom.

560
01:11:26,125 --> 01:11:27,333
Damn.

561
01:11:28,333 --> 01:11:30,293
I can't even take part
in the school festival now.

562
01:11:35,125 --> 01:11:38,875
Then again, it's not the first time.

563
01:11:40,625 --> 01:11:41,750
Huh?

564
01:11:48,417 --> 01:11:49,667
The power's back.

565
01:11:54,417 --> 01:11:55,958
So pretty...!

566
01:12:02,708 --> 01:12:04,292
Been here for 3 months

567
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:07,457
and never seen it so lively.

568
01:12:07,458 --> 01:12:12,458
(NIGHT FLIGHT)

569
01:12:16,417 --> 01:12:20,208
Guess it'll be hard to visit here.

570
01:12:23,250 --> 01:12:24,792
Hard to see you.

571
01:12:33,042 --> 01:12:34,417
Wanna go... take a shit?

572
01:12:46,708 --> 01:12:48,500
Let's just go.

573
01:12:52,375 --> 01:12:54,042
What if we get caught?

574
01:12:56,250 --> 01:12:57,500
So what?

575
01:12:57,875 --> 01:12:59,708
I'm through with this school now.

576
01:13:06,375 --> 01:13:09,042
This will surprise them.

577
01:13:11,208 --> 01:13:12,750
Homeroom teacher, the eunuch.

578
01:13:13,583 --> 01:13:16,167
Have eunuch bastards
for generations to come.

579
01:13:17,542 --> 01:13:21,458
You think...
you're the only one with a mouth?

580
01:13:23,458 --> 01:13:24,458
Who's there?

581
01:13:25,667 --> 01:13:27,042
Hey!

582
01:13:28,708 --> 01:13:31,457
Stop right there!

583
01:13:31,458 --> 01:13:33,542
(HERE TOO)

584
01:13:43,458 --> 01:13:44,708
See you over the break.

585
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:00,500
Jun-woo

586
01:14:04,167 --> 01:14:05,708
Song Jun-woo!

587
01:14:15,792 --> 01:14:17,292
Don't you do it.

588
01:14:18,667 --> 01:14:20,833
Don't you turn your back on me.

589
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:42,458
Was seen there yesterday.

590
01:14:43,292 --> 01:14:44,708
But that's all.

591
01:14:48,417 --> 01:14:49,625
Good luck.

592
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,500
My only weak point is, I'm too soft.

593
01:15:02,583 --> 01:15:03,958
Where are you off to now?

594
01:15:04,125 --> 01:15:05,292
Wait for me.

595
01:15:06,417 --> 01:15:08,917
Why? You're gonna run off again?

596
01:15:11,417 --> 01:15:13,583
Fuck,
what's the matter with you these days?

597
01:15:14,542 --> 01:15:17,500
Tell the small fry bastard,
that I'll kill him!

598
01:15:19,542 --> 01:15:21,125
Come. Let's go.　-Let go, let go.

599
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:26,917
Where the hell have you been?

600
01:15:36,042 --> 01:15:38,667
The school will kick you out
if you don't come and write a pledge.

601
01:15:50,083 --> 01:15:52,167
You know how much I looked for you?

602
01:15:56,250 --> 01:15:57,542
You'll come to school, right?

603
01:16:03,167 --> 01:16:05,083
I get nervous without you.

604
01:16:06,542 --> 01:16:08,708
The bastards act up like shit.

605
01:16:09,958 --> 01:16:11,833
Can't focus on my studies, either...

606
01:16:12,083 --> 01:16:14,417
Who would I trust except you?

607
01:16:18,292 --> 01:16:19,625
Am I your mom?

608
01:16:35,458 --> 01:16:40,792
(REHIRE LAID-OFF WORKERS IMMIDIATELY)

609
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:50,167
Where did Han Sang-gi go?

610
01:16:51,375 --> 01:16:52,792
Where is he?

611
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:57,583
You must know, you were his friend.

612
01:16:57,958 --> 01:16:59,583
Let go, damn.

613
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:02,208
You would know where he is!

614
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:04,833
I said, let go!

615
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:12,625
Why do you pretend you don't know.

616
01:17:12,792 --> 01:17:14,458
He was your leader!

617
01:17:14,750 --> 01:17:17,167
Where is he?

618
01:17:17,375 --> 01:17:20,291
No talking? I know he was here.

619
01:17:20,292 --> 01:17:22,707
Stop it!　-Don't pretend you don't know!

620
01:17:22,708 --> 01:17:26,249
We don't know, either!　-Bring him now!

621
01:17:26,250 --> 01:17:28,999
We can't do anything here!

622
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,916
I'm not going, fuck!

623
01:17:30,917 --> 01:17:32,375
Bring him here!

624
01:17:33,708 --> 01:17:35,417
Bring him now!

625
01:17:37,917 --> 01:17:39,500
Please calm down!

626
01:17:39,917 --> 01:17:41,957
Bring back the son of a bitch!

627
01:17:41,958 --> 01:17:44,958
Bring Han Sang-gi! Now!

628
01:19:13,583 --> 01:19:14,875
Hey, Han Gi-woong!

629
01:19:16,083 --> 01:19:18,292
Coming and going as you please.

630
01:19:22,042 --> 01:19:25,917
Go see the student director right now.

631
01:19:27,208 --> 01:19:28,292
Now!

632
01:19:43,083 --> 01:19:44,417
Shin Yong-ju...

633
01:19:50,750 --> 01:19:54,000
Write the pledge
if you don't want to be kicked out.

634
01:20:00,083 --> 01:20:01,875
Am I a joke to you?

635
01:20:02,167 --> 01:20:03,917
I was in the Marine Corp.

636
01:20:05,958 --> 01:20:07,500
Start writing!

637
01:20:08,792 --> 01:20:10,250
Are you getting fresh with me now?

638
01:20:12,917 --> 01:20:15,542
Think I haven't seen bastards like you
before?

639
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:20,458
Why don't you just drop out?

640
01:20:21,042 --> 01:20:22,833
Instead of
ruining the academic atmosphere.

641
01:20:34,708 --> 01:20:38,833
Mr. Yi, must be tough with these idiots.

642
01:20:43,625 --> 01:20:47,208
Come see me
at the teachers' office later.

643
01:20:52,208 --> 01:20:53,375
Come here.

644
01:21:01,208 --> 01:21:02,417
Sit down.

645
01:21:07,708 --> 01:21:09,542
Don't you have something to tell me?

646
01:21:13,333 --> 01:21:15,167
You're wearing glasses, sir.

647
01:21:18,417 --> 01:21:20,057
You feel like joking at a time like this?

648
01:21:25,708 --> 01:21:27,583
This come from the other school.

649
01:21:28,417 --> 01:21:30,208
The teachers' office is in an uproar.

650
01:21:41,625 --> 01:21:43,167
Are you...

651
01:21:43,875 --> 01:21:45,208
A gay, too?

652
01:22:03,625 --> 01:22:05,708
Just promise me one thing.

653
01:22:06,542 --> 01:22:08,000
Get into Seoul University.

654
01:22:10,417 --> 01:22:14,583
Nothing else matters.

655
01:22:17,625 --> 01:22:19,167
Go back to class.

656
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:48,958
In extreme cases,
sexual assaults or murder.

657
01:22:49,125 --> 01:22:53,417
They say they followed what they saw
on film or TV.

658
01:22:53,583 --> 01:22:55,083
Who's fault is it?

659
01:22:56,042 --> 01:22:59,208
Adolescents follow stars and trends.

660
01:22:59,583 --> 01:23:08,292
Clothes, bags, shoes
that stars wear on tv become sold out.

661
01:23:10,333 --> 01:23:13,250
Why are you still on page 69?

662
01:23:13,542 --> 01:23:15,625
Everyone else is on page 70.

663
01:23:17,042 --> 01:23:18,833
You like69. Don't you?

664
01:23:19,750 --> 01:23:21,291
He watches porn every day.

665
01:23:21,292 --> 01:23:22,750
“I'm coming! I'm coming!”

666
01:23:23,708 --> 01:23:25,208
Be quiet!

667
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,583
Should you be watching porn
and jerking off?

668
01:23:33,042 --> 01:23:34,583
Just go to college.

669
01:23:34,917 --> 01:23:38,417
Then no one will care whatever you do.

670
01:23:38,750 --> 01:23:40,167
Bastards.

671
01:23:43,250 --> 01:23:44,833
You know what?

672
01:23:45,917 --> 01:23:50,667
I heard a bastard at our school
is a homo...

673
01:23:51,667 --> 01:23:53,583
Heard he's in this class.

674
01:23:54,083 --> 01:23:55,167
Who is it?

675
01:23:58,417 --> 01:24:00,042
How disgusting...!

676
01:24:00,917 --> 01:24:04,125
Guess someone will end up
with a male daughter-in-law.

677
01:24:06,667 --> 01:24:11,166
Cut the shit and just study hard, got it?

678
01:24:11,167 --> 01:24:12,458
Yes, sir.

679
01:24:12,833 --> 01:24:16,124
And go to church on weekends
and pray hard, got that?

680
01:24:16,125 --> 01:24:17,417
Yes, sir.

681
01:24:19,458 --> 01:24:21,499
Attention, salute the teacher.

682
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:23,082
Thank you, sir.

683
01:24:23,083 --> 01:24:24,791
It's you right.

684
01:24:24,792 --> 01:24:27,124
It's okay, you're my pal.

685
01:24:27,125 --> 01:24:28,374
He's been fishy.

686
01:24:28,375 --> 01:24:29,208
Is it you?

687
01:24:29,375 --> 01:24:30,917
No, way!

688
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:32,292
Is it you?

689
01:24:32,292 --> 01:24:33,292
No!

690
01:24:37,792 --> 01:24:39,792
Which bastard is it?

691
01:24:40,458 --> 01:24:42,625
What if he has AIDS?

692
01:26:33,625 --> 01:26:35,833
Run away with me.

693
01:26:38,625 --> 01:26:44,250
I'm so scared.

694
01:26:57,708 --> 01:27:00,625
Know
where the southernmost train station is?

695
01:27:02,917 --> 01:27:04,292
It's Yeosu.

696
01:27:06,083 --> 01:27:07,625
I thought it was Busan.

697
01:27:09,792 --> 01:27:12,042
The last train leaves

698
01:27:15,333 --> 01:27:16,833
At 8 o'clock.

699
01:27:35,458 --> 01:27:38,417
They say if it leaves four trails...
it's an airliner.

700
01:27:39,542 --> 01:27:43,667
If it leaves two. It's a fighter jet.

701
01:27:46,625 --> 01:27:48,542
Damn, this is shitty.

702
01:28:06,792 --> 01:28:08,208
Don't you...

703
01:28:11,167 --> 01:28:12,833
Get lonely?

704
01:28:20,167 --> 01:28:21,583
Han Gi-woong.

705
01:28:39,083 --> 01:28:41,125
Heard they'll tear down this place
next week.

706
01:28:45,792 --> 01:28:47,542
Should we leave it on?

707
01:29:00,833 --> 01:29:03,167
Turning your back to me even to the end.

708
01:29:30,750 --> 01:29:32,417
What are you... to me?

709
01:29:35,167 --> 01:29:36,500
Can't you...

710
01:29:37,958 --> 01:29:40,083
Just smile for me?

711
01:29:44,167 --> 01:29:45,917
So stupid.

712
01:29:46,542 --> 01:29:47,750
Yeah.

713
01:29:48,542 --> 01:29:52,542
So I'll never look at you again.

714
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,667
Never call your name again,

715
01:29:57,125 --> 01:29:59,125
never remember a bastard like you,

716
01:30:02,833 --> 01:30:05,292
not even for a second.

717
01:30:37,167 --> 01:30:39,292
Guess I'll find someone again.

718
01:30:43,958 --> 01:30:49,417
This world is over without a friend.

719
01:31:00,083 --> 01:31:02,042
Although you'll never know.

720
01:31:34,458 --> 01:31:39,458
My son.
Who never answers the goddamn phone.

721
01:31:40,292 --> 01:31:41,833
Hey!

722
01:31:45,375 --> 01:31:46,875
Is something wrong?

723
01:31:50,667 --> 01:31:52,167
The hot news is,

724
01:31:53,583 --> 01:31:57,167
your mom's been dumped again.

725
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,708
It's not the first time, either, anyway!

726
01:32:01,042 --> 01:32:05,125
Drink up, Juju. It's okay with your Mom.

727
01:32:10,542 --> 01:32:15,624
Any bastard who says 'love is...
two people standing side by side

728
01:32:15,625 --> 01:32:21,000
Looking in the same direction'
are all freaking crooks.

729
01:32:22,292 --> 01:32:29,250
Then drivers rushing on the highway
all fall in love?

730
01:32:29,417 --> 01:32:30,792
What a laugh.

731
01:32:31,167 --> 01:32:32,583
Love is...

732
01:32:38,208 --> 01:32:40,458
looking at different directions.

733
01:32:40,667 --> 01:32:46,833
The bastard couldn't accept
this professional life of mine.

734
01:32:47,375 --> 01:32:49,249
Is love a guy's dick?

735
01:32:49,250 --> 01:32:52,042
Turning big or small?

736
01:32:52,208 --> 01:32:53,792
Fuck.

737
01:33:03,708 --> 01:33:05,000
Mom.

738
01:33:06,667 --> 01:33:07,833
What?

739
01:33:09,417 --> 01:33:11,167
Do you know...

740
01:33:12,125 --> 01:33:14,583
everything about me?

741
01:33:20,917 --> 01:33:23,292
How would I know, you bastard.

742
01:33:26,167 --> 01:33:28,458
Did you kill someone?

743
01:33:34,167 --> 01:33:39,500
I've learned one thing.

744
01:33:41,250 --> 01:33:45,250
By raising a son
as a single unwed mother at 26.

745
01:33:46,750 --> 01:33:51,667
There's nothing stupid
as minding what the world thinks of you.

746
01:33:54,292 --> 01:33:56,893
I got no end of scorn and temptation
for being a single mom, you know?

747
01:33:56,917 --> 01:34:01,875
I only want you
to live without hurting other people.

748
01:34:03,292 --> 01:34:04,625
So,

749
01:34:06,042 --> 01:34:10,417
Don't care about studies and all.

750
01:34:11,167 --> 01:34:13,292
That's all I want.

751
01:34:13,458 --> 01:34:14,708
Even if...

752
01:34:17,083 --> 01:34:19,208
I'm different from other people?

753
01:34:29,583 --> 01:34:30,958
Shin Yong-ju!

754
01:34:32,833 --> 01:34:34,500
Who gave birth to you?

755
01:34:37,792 --> 01:34:41,292
Does that face change,

756
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:44,833
even if you grow gobbling horns
on your head?

757
01:34:57,250 --> 01:34:59,208
When are you packing?

758
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:29,000
He's doing well?

759
01:35:34,333 --> 01:35:35,833
What does it matter?

760
01:35:42,167 --> 01:35:47,750
He can't come home
because of police surveillance.

761
01:35:49,292 --> 01:35:54,417
Not embarrassed that labor union bastards
gave him the cold shoulder?

762
01:35:54,958 --> 01:35:56,542
Criminal bastard.

763
01:36:12,250 --> 01:36:17,082
# My friend said it's not easy
to meet the queen.

764
01:36:17,083 --> 01:36:20,624
# But it doesn't mean it's impossible.

765
01:36:20,625 --> 01:36:25,708
# You had always wanted to take a picture
with the queen.

766
01:36:26,292 --> 01:36:27,624
# Back when?

767
01:36:27,625 --> 01:36:32,166
# In high school.
We'd chat all day on the school roof.

768
01:36:32,167 --> 01:36:33,500
# I remember.

769
01:37:00,750 --> 01:37:02,167
You're here early.

770
01:37:15,167 --> 01:37:16,582
Good morning.

771
01:37:16,583 --> 01:37:18,000
Hi.

772
01:37:46,792 --> 01:37:48,083
Have one.

773
01:38:10,375 --> 01:38:11,583
Hey, homo!

774
01:38:13,833 --> 01:38:15,250
Where're you going?

775
01:38:16,333 --> 01:38:18,000
I heard you're the gay king?

776
01:38:18,625 --> 01:38:20,332
I really like gays, too.

777
01:38:20,333 --> 01:38:21,083
Get out.

778
01:38:21,083 --> 01:38:22,042
Get out!

779
01:38:22,043 --> 01:38:24,708
Get lost. Fucking bastards!

780
01:38:24,958 --> 01:38:28,292
Get out now, before I bash your skulls!

781
01:38:32,792 --> 01:38:34,042
Yong-ju.

782
01:38:34,792 --> 01:38:36,458
I hear you're a pro at this.

783
01:38:40,250 --> 01:38:42,000
Suck mine, too.

784
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:43,708
You homo bastard!

785
01:38:44,500 --> 01:38:45,750
Fuck.

786
01:38:46,250 --> 01:38:48,250
It was like a hidden picture puzzle.

787
01:38:48,875 --> 01:38:52,250
Wondered who it was... in our class.

788
01:38:52,667 --> 01:38:54,292
Does your grandma know, too?

789
01:38:55,583 --> 01:38:56,958
Who says so?

790
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:00,500
This friend here...

791
01:39:01,292 --> 01:39:02,583
No?

792
01:39:03,750 --> 01:39:04,999
No...

793
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,333
Jerks.

794
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,417
Where do you think you're going?

795
01:39:08,625 --> 01:39:11,417
Suck mine, too, you fucking bastard!

796
01:39:12,708 --> 01:39:17,292
Stay still, you dirty asshole.

797
01:39:17,833 --> 01:39:19,583
You like that?

798
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,875
Stay still.

799
01:39:22,375 --> 01:39:24,042
Hey, get the fuck out.

800
01:39:25,875 --> 01:39:27,333
Told you to stay still.

801
01:39:29,583 --> 01:39:31,750
Heard Gi-taek witnessed yesterday.

802
01:39:35,708 --> 01:39:37,292
I wonder what this is.

803
01:39:42,792 --> 01:39:45,208
You know what schwul in German means?

804
01:39:47,542 --> 01:39:48,917
Schwul.

805
01:39:50,167 --> 01:39:54,125
Ho, mo, sex, ual.

806
01:39:55,375 --> 01:39:56,874
I even like the sound of it.

807
01:39:56,875 --> 01:39:58,667
Homo schwul bastard.

808
01:39:59,417 --> 01:40:00,875
Let him go.

809
01:40:01,875 --> 01:40:03,083
Get up.

810
01:40:10,292 --> 01:40:11,583
Yong-ju.

811
01:40:13,125 --> 01:40:17,667
Friends wouldn't spread rumors
or anything, right?

812
01:40:26,083 --> 01:40:27,500
And...

813
01:40:27,917 --> 01:40:32,125
lower yourself a bit
when you talk to people.

814
01:40:33,958 --> 01:40:35,500
Fucking bastard.

815
01:40:38,333 --> 01:40:40,125
Because this is your eye level.

816
01:40:43,583 --> 01:40:44,875
Hey, let's go.

817
01:40:47,958 --> 01:40:51,583
See you tomorrow, homo.

818
01:41:04,208 --> 01:41:07,666
You're the one who betrayed first!

819
01:41:07,667 --> 01:41:09,333
What betrayal?

820
01:41:11,458 --> 01:41:12,792
Disgusting.

821
01:41:13,375 --> 01:41:16,333
You and Gi-woong both!

822
01:41:19,417 --> 01:41:22,042
Gi-taek!

823
01:41:41,458 --> 01:41:42,750
Hey, Han Gi-woong!

824
01:41:56,875 --> 01:41:58,375
Why so cold?

825
01:42:04,833 --> 01:42:07,250
I'm beginning to forget your face.

826
01:42:13,375 --> 01:42:15,042
Gi-taek's our friend now.

827
01:42:15,208 --> 01:42:16,833
It's about time.

828
01:42:22,708 --> 01:42:24,458
You and Yong-ju aren't like that, huh?

829
01:42:29,500 --> 01:42:31,042
There's been such a rumor.

830
01:42:37,625 --> 01:42:39,583
Our leader shouldn't be like that, right?

831
01:42:39,958 --> 01:42:41,542
Of course you aren't, right?

832
01:42:56,208 --> 01:42:58,042
I have a question.

833
01:43:00,417 --> 01:43:01,666
This guy set a factory on fire

834
01:43:01,667 --> 01:43:04,333
And went to jail several years ago.

835
01:43:10,583 --> 01:43:12,042
Someone you know?

836
01:43:13,375 --> 01:43:14,708
No, right?

837
01:43:17,458 --> 01:43:20,458
Can't have the school look bad
with low-income classes.

838
01:43:28,625 --> 01:43:29,625
Don't come near me!

839
01:43:30,917 --> 01:43:33,708
It's your freaking dad!

840
01:43:34,542 --> 01:43:38,082
You cried after getting beaten by kids
in junior high.

841
01:43:38,083 --> 01:43:39,250
Didn't you?

842
01:43:39,708 --> 01:43:40,916
Teachers didn't like you either,

843
01:43:40,917 --> 01:43:43,167
So they spread a rumor at school!

844
01:43:50,833 --> 01:43:53,792
What did I do so wrong?

845
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,750
That you all bully me?

846
01:44:24,125 --> 01:44:25,833
Do you deliver chicken, too?

847
01:44:26,958 --> 01:44:28,792
Bring some here if you have time.

848
01:44:31,250 --> 01:44:32,958
You're coming to school tomorrow?

849
01:44:41,417 --> 01:44:42,917
Fuck, hit me!

850
01:44:43,083 --> 01:44:44,625
Hit me, you son of a bitch!

851
01:44:44,792 --> 01:44:47,333
You betrayed me first!

852
01:44:49,708 --> 01:44:51,125
I was never...

853
01:44:53,167 --> 01:44:55,083
your friend.

854
01:45:03,667 --> 01:45:04,750
Let go! Fuck...

855
01:45:32,208 --> 01:45:33,333
Excuse me.

856
01:46:07,042 --> 01:46:08,500
How did you find me?

857
01:46:11,333 --> 01:46:12,750
Why did you come out?

858
01:46:15,542 --> 01:46:17,125
To set this place on fire?

859
01:46:27,208 --> 01:46:31,000
You know how Mom and I've been living?

860
01:46:31,542 --> 01:46:35,083
Why did you do it? Why?

861
01:46:37,292 --> 01:46:38,999
You know how I've been living

862
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,333
All because of you high horse?

863
01:46:46,917 --> 01:46:49,292
Damn, why did you do it?

864
01:46:58,375 --> 01:46:59,917
You've grown a lot.

865
01:47:01,792 --> 01:47:03,875
Should've bought a razor.

866
01:47:14,875 --> 01:47:16,167
Gi-woong!

867
01:47:17,292 --> 01:47:18,833
Gi-woong!

868
01:47:19,667 --> 01:47:20,958
Gi-woong!

869
01:47:21,583 --> 01:47:22,958
Han Gi-woong!

870
01:47:25,292 --> 01:47:27,000
Fuck, let go!

871
01:47:39,167 --> 01:47:40,625
I'm sorry.

872
01:47:55,042 --> 01:47:57,250
Thought you were dead.

873
01:48:01,500 --> 01:48:03,417
Don't die on us.

874
01:48:58,708 --> 01:49:00,041
Nothing but a dickhead.

875
01:49:00,042 --> 01:49:01,625
Out of my way!

876
01:49:19,375 --> 01:49:20,833
Gi-woong, you okay?

877
01:49:34,917 --> 01:49:36,083
Gi-woong.

878
01:49:41,125 --> 01:49:42,542
Han Gi-woong.

879
01:49:55,792 --> 01:49:57,167
Fuck off.

880
01:50:03,458 --> 01:50:04,750
Gi-woong!

881
01:50:08,333 --> 01:50:09,750
Han Gi-woong!

882
01:53:11,625 --> 01:53:13,042
Aren't you packing?

883
01:53:18,542 --> 01:53:23,250
We aren't moving anyway.

884
01:53:52,333 --> 01:53:53,958
I made breakfast.

885
01:53:55,542 --> 01:53:56,833
Let's eat.

886
01:54:19,042 --> 01:54:21,667
Hey, stop right there!

887
01:54:22,167 --> 01:54:23,542
Son of a bitch, stop!

888
01:54:24,125 --> 01:54:26,875
Hey, stop right there bitch!

889
01:54:33,708 --> 01:54:35,250
Come here.

890
01:54:42,167 --> 01:54:44,833
Thanks for the damn morning exercise.

891
01:54:45,042 --> 01:54:47,417
Damn bitch, think you can run away?

892
01:54:50,083 --> 01:54:52,583
Seong-jin!

893
01:54:52,875 --> 01:54:53,875
Let go!

894
01:54:56,042 --> 01:54:58,667
Come down you asshole.

895
01:55:27,708 --> 01:55:29,083
Careful with that taser!

896
01:55:33,333 --> 01:55:37,125
Didn't I tell you not to challenge me?

897
01:55:38,292 --> 01:55:39,832
Bring the bastard's camera!

898
01:55:39,833 --> 01:55:41,666
Relax, you shit.

899
01:55:41,667 --> 01:55:42,792
Gi-taek!

900
01:55:42,958 --> 01:55:46,458
Shut up, you bitch.

901
01:55:48,083 --> 01:55:49,541
Shoot it nice and quick.

902
01:55:49,542 --> 01:55:51,292
I'll but it on Youtube.

903
01:55:51,917 --> 01:55:53,417
Like it?

904
01:55:54,500 --> 01:55:55,917
Like it?

905
01:55:56,125 --> 01:55:57,375
Hey, you bitch!

906
01:56:16,083 --> 01:56:17,250
Han Gi-woong.

907
01:56:22,208 --> 01:56:23,667
Yong-ju...

908
01:56:59,167 --> 01:57:00,333
Yong-ju!

909
01:57:02,250 --> 01:57:03,708
Shin Yong-ju.

910
01:57:06,333 --> 01:57:07,792
Shin Yong-ju.

911
01:58:17,792 --> 01:58:19,083
Yong-ju!

912
01:58:39,167 --> 01:58:41,333
They even took the memory chip.

913
01:58:42,708 --> 01:58:45,750
This cost $100 without vat...

914
01:59:07,792 --> 01:59:08,792
Don't you...

915
01:59:11,375 --> 01:59:12,958
Com near me, either.

916
01:59:19,500 --> 01:59:20,833
Fuck off.

917
01:59:53,875 --> 01:59:56,583
That bastard always comes
in the middle of class.

918
01:59:58,292 --> 01:59:59,500
Take your seat now!

919
02:00:00,125 --> 02:00:01,417
Sit down now!

920
02:00:02,250 --> 02:00:03,250
Where is it?

921
02:00:04,542 --> 02:00:05,083
What is?

922
02:00:05,084 --> 02:00:07,083
Bastard, late and all...

923
02:00:09,208 --> 02:00:10,417
Stop it!

924
02:00:13,542 --> 02:00:14,333
Sit!

925
02:00:14,333 --> 02:00:15,333
Sit down!

926
02:00:16,292 --> 02:00:17,582
Where is it, bastard!

927
02:00:17,583 --> 02:00:18,583
Stop it!

928
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,750
Let go, son of a bitch!

929
02:00:26,958 --> 02:00:28,333
Give it back!

930
02:00:31,792 --> 02:00:33,292
You shit!

931
02:00:45,750 --> 02:00:46,917
Han Gi-woong.

932
02:00:47,083 --> 02:00:48,083
You fucking bastard!

933
02:00:55,625 --> 02:00:57,125
Where is it?

934
02:00:58,542 --> 02:01:00,292
Where the hell is it?

935
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,292
I have nothing.

936
02:01:32,917 --> 02:01:36,917
What are you doing in the honors class?
Get out!

937
02:01:37,750 --> 02:01:39,000
Give it back.

938
02:01:39,167 --> 02:01:40,374
Give what?

939
02:01:40,375 --> 02:01:42,417
Fuck, give it!

940
02:01:43,500 --> 02:01:45,958
Get out you crazy shit!

941
02:01:53,667 --> 02:01:54,833
You bastard!

942
02:01:57,583 --> 02:02:00,542
Give it back, you son of a bitch!

943
02:02:03,417 --> 02:02:04,625
Fuck...!

944
02:02:11,500 --> 02:02:12,750
Son of bitch...!

945
02:02:15,792 --> 02:02:18,083
Fuck, give it back, dammit!

946
02:02:24,708 --> 02:02:25,708
Fuck!

947
02:02:35,625 --> 02:02:36,917
Fucking bastard...

948
02:02:41,250 --> 02:02:44,917
think you can still run away?

949
02:03:08,083 --> 02:03:09,167
Han Gi-woong!

950
02:03:10,292 --> 02:03:11,458
Bastard!

951
02:03:12,208 --> 02:03:13,500
What the hell are you doing?

952
02:03:14,375 --> 02:03:15,667
Fuck!

953
02:03:44,167 --> 02:03:45,332
Stop!

954
02:03:45,333 --> 02:03:46,458
Stop!

955
02:03:46,625 --> 02:03:47,875
No!

956
02:03:50,625 --> 02:03:52,042
Gi-woong!

957
02:03:55,583 --> 02:03:58,750
Call an ambulance, an ambulance!

958
02:04:01,875 --> 02:04:03,250
Call an ambulance.

959
02:04:43,417 --> 02:04:44,917
What are you going to do now?

960
02:04:45,417 --> 02:04:46,792
Are you transferring?

961
02:04:49,375 --> 02:04:50,667
Dropping out.

962
02:04:54,917 --> 02:04:56,917
Why didn't you report earlier?

963
02:05:00,083 --> 02:05:03,833
How would that help?

964
02:05:30,625 --> 02:05:33,167
What is he doing?
Is he nuts or something?

965
02:05:34,792 --> 02:05:37,333
Must be crazy...

966
02:05:37,500 --> 02:05:38,749
Isn't he the one...?

967
02:05:38,750 --> 02:05:40,792
You crazy bastard! Get down now!

968
02:05:40,958 --> 02:05:42,708
Hey! You son of a bitch!

969
02:05:43,250 --> 02:05:46,000
Get down, get down!

970
02:05:46,375 --> 02:05:47,417
Get down, I say!

971
02:05:47,583 --> 02:05:49,083
Get down, you bastard!

972
02:05:52,333 --> 02:05:55,375
What the hell are you doing
to the school building?

973
02:05:55,625 --> 02:05:56,707
You wacko.

974
02:05:56,708 --> 02:05:59,707
Erase it all before you go.

975
02:05:59,708 --> 02:06:01,166
Crazy bastard.

976
02:06:01,167 --> 02:06:03,542
Go up and erase it.

977
02:06:03,708 --> 02:06:05,083
Erase it, hurry!

978
02:06:14,958 --> 02:06:15,958
(A GAY LIVES HERE TOO)

979
02:06:15,959 --> 02:06:17,583
Go bring a teacher.

980
02:07:19,042 --> 02:07:20,750
Even if they settle...

981
02:07:23,167 --> 02:07:25,792
you'd have to do time for about 5 months.

982
02:07:38,667 --> 02:07:39,917
I'm sorry.

983
02:07:43,083 --> 02:07:44,542
For not coming sooner.

984
02:07:49,958 --> 02:07:51,750
It's in my pants pocket.

985
02:08:18,708 --> 02:08:20,958
(SEOUL TO YEOSU)

986
02:08:56,125 --> 02:08:58,083
# Look it's so freaking gross.

987
02:08:58,250 --> 02:09:00,333
(DELETE)

988
02:09:16,792 --> 02:09:20,625
I dropped out today.

989
02:09:24,958 --> 02:09:27,333
I'm going to an alternative school
in the provinces.

990
02:09:31,500 --> 02:09:33,458
It's a school in a mountain.

991
02:09:36,167 --> 02:09:37,750
Gandhi School

992
02:09:39,167 --> 02:09:40,541
They have dorms...

993
02:09:40,542 --> 02:09:42,000
Don't go.

994
02:09:46,542 --> 02:09:47,708
I'm so hard...

995
02:09:50,625 --> 02:09:52,292
I think I'll break down.

996
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,167
Never again...　-Never again.

997
02:10:06,667 --> 02:10:07,833
Please...

998
02:10:18,792 --> 02:10:20,750
I'm fucking lonely.
