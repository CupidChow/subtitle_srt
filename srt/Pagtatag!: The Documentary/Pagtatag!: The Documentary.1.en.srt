1
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:53,762
- SB19!
- SB19!

2
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,851
<i>- We are…</i>
<i>- SB19!</i>

3
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:26,127
<i>…and now even Korean super-idol, Minzy</i>
<i>has done the "Gento" challenge.</i>

4
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,463
<i>"Gento" is really taking off as a trend.</i>

5
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:30,590
<i>- Is it still trending?</i>
<i>- Yes. Super.</i>

6
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,473
We're rich!

7
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:49,067
There's too much going on in our lives
for things to get boring.

8
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:54,405
<i>Pause.</i>

9
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:55,865
<i>Silence.</i>

10
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,992
<i>Silence from SB19.</i>

11
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:02,956
<i>Could the timing of all this</i>
<i>be any more ominous?</i>

12
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:07,001
- Mahalima!
- Mahalima!

13
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,169
<i>What just happened?</i>

14
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,630
<i>Don't turn off their mics</i>
<i>without telling them.</i>

15
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:13,925
<i>Imagine them performing</i>
<i>with this burden in their minds.</i>

16
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:16,094
<i>No matter what happened,</i>
<i>we were on the losing end.</i>

17
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,262
<i>Big problem.</i>

18
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:21,432
<i>Why is this happening?</i>
<i>I thought everything was going well.</i>

19
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,184
<i>Is this how things end for us?</i>

20
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,311
<i>SB19!</i>

21
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:12,275
Even we were surprised
by the reaction to our song "Gento."

22
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:15,486
So we thought instead of
being limited to old plans,

23
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:21,951
we should think of new plans
to further promote "Gento."

24
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:26,164
A global approach since the song
proves to have a global reach.

25
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,709
At first, I was close-minded
about my approach to music.

26
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:32,003
I thought we shouldn't mix languages
within a song.

27
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:35,798
But music inspires emotion
beyond language.

28
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:36,841
Even with lyrics like…

29
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,010
- "Lataratara."
- Yes, even "Lataratara."

30
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:45,516
Music knows no boundaries when it comes
to touching people's feelings.

31
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,062
When I first heard "Gento," I thought,
"Okay, this is a good title track."

32
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:51,481
- Then I heard "Crimzone," I thought…
- A strong contender.

33
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,691
I thought it was a strong track.
Why not make it our title track?

34
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,152
They asked me
why it was my pick for the title track.

35
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,445
I said, "Because it's in English."

36
00:03:57,528 --> 00:04:00,865
- I thought anyone could understand it.
- Yes, that was your reason.

37
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:05,411
We were starting to develop SB19
as an act that could be known globally.

38
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,956
So I thought we should release
an English song as our title track.

39
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,374
And now I wonder,

40
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:12,168
what if we had released
"Crimzone" instead of "Gento"?

41
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:17,632
Would "Gento" have the same impact
if we hadn't released it as a title track?

42
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:20,218
Language isn't a barrier
to a song's potential.

43
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:25,473
<i>It was like a plant we were nurturing</i>
<i>at the beginning of our EP.</i>

44
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:28,893
<i>It grew and established itself.</i>

45
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:32,689
- It exploded.
- Yes, it exploded into a solid gold tree.

46
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:36,859
Our story from Pagsibol was about growth.

47
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:41,322
Continues in "Pagtatag!" with the message,
"This is who we are now. This is SB19."

48
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:44,158
We went through a lot. It was hard work.

49
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:49,289
It took our blood, sweat,
and tears to make it this far.

50
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:54,043
We are a P-pop group that has transitioned
into being self-managed artists.

51
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,380
We're very happy.

52
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,423
Yes.

53
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,633
There are challenges.

54
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:03,469
It is difficult at times,
but the accomplishments

55
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,388
feel even more fulfilling.

56
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,806
It's more fulfilling.

57
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,933
And we can only blame ourselves
from now on.

58
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,439
The group is super sensitive to it

59
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:18,735
because we see our craft
as something sacred.

60
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:26,909
Or even the manpower,
in terms of our staff who help us,

61
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:33,291
I think we can fully express ourselves
and get back to everything we used to do.

62
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:37,920
<i>And maybe this would really help</i>
<i>to push boundaries.</i>

63
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:43,426
We want to inspire others,
especially those surrounding us

64
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:47,555
to persevere in their daily lives

65
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:50,183
so that together,
we can create something beautiful

66
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:53,644
and the results can be seen
around the world.

67
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,251
<i>We'll do a sound check, SB,</i>

68
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,544
<i>Sir Richard…</i>

69
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,880
<i>Band, let's keep it quiet first.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

70
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:21,964
<i>Standby.</i>

71
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,720
Hi, Leo.

72
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,473
For my in-ear monitors…
This is Stell by the way.

73
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:35,103
Can we lower Pablo
and Josh's volume levels?

74
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,395
Jah, can you sing out?

75
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,905
<i>Is that volume okay, SB?</i>

76
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:48,699
We can go lower, I think.
Or better yet, let's mute everyone.

77
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,956
When they presented to me
the "Pagtatag!" EP,

78
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,459
I told them to give me all the demos.

79
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:01,504
Send me all the demos
so I can review everything.

80
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:21,399
I added my take on things, like mash-ups.

81
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:24,318
Do you want to work on the mash-ups
so we can see what needs fixing?

82
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:27,488
- Then we'll work on "Gento" and "Mana."
- Let's prioritize the mash-up.

83
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:28,614
That's important.

84
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,201
To Loraine, they're important.

85
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,454
You are such a bully!

86
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:37,248
I told them, "Why don't we mash up songs?

87
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,542
Because you are such strong singers.

88
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:44,630
We should showcase that
you are all such strong singers."

89
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,259
There seems to be…

90
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:52,722
There seems to be quite a lot of reverb
in the music we're hearing?

91
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:53,806
Yes.

92
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:57,268
It almost seems like we're hearing double.

93
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:59,020
Like an echo.

94
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:02,773
<i>We can ask them not to play</i>
<i>the live band in our in-ear monitors.</i>

95
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:03,983
<i>- I like hearing the band.</i>
<i>- It adds vibes.</i>

96
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:07,945
<i>- The live band heightens the feeling but…</i>
<i>- The mixing needs to be balanced.</i>

97
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,239
During the last playback, could you
hear yourself through the monitors?

98
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,282
A little.

99
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:15,536
But I can't say, when they're singing,

100
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,955
it just has this really
super live feel, you know?

101
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,500
- If the backing track is on 70…
- Then we should be hearing--

102
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,709
Then we should be hearing it.

103
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:22,960
But I don't hear it.

104
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,505
While we're singing,
our voices occupy most of the mix.

105
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,215
<i>I've been working with them</i>

106
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:30,343
<i>for three years, so I'm able to include</i>
<i>their input and their likes</i>

107
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:33,304
into my presentation.

108
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:35,097
And then when they comment things like,

109
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,641
"Do you think we can do something like…"

110
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:37,642
They're always coming up with,

111
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:41,437
"Do you think we can try a lifter
on this number?"

112
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,774
I say, "Of course!"
Then we'll start planning the staging.

113
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,609
<i>When we were programming "Pagtatag!",</i>

114
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:50,363
I consulted them and asked,
"What do you want for your show?"

115
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:53,032
Is it narrative-based
or is it a concert-type

116
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,534
<i>made up of segments or vignettes?</i>

117
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:00,957
<i>Our approach is very theatrical</i>
<i>because we happen to like it that way.</i>

118
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,708
<i>SB19 enjoys exploring theatrical elements.</i>

119
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,043
<i>There's a ballad suite.</i>

120
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,044
<i>A dance suite.</i>

121
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:07,755
A solo suite and then the fan service.

122
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,674
Fan service is always
part of their performance.

123
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,676
<i>They are always asking me,</i>

124
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,220
<i>"Let's make sure</i>
<i>we give back to our fans."</i>

125
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,603
So hot!

126
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,688
<i>Choreography.</i>

127
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:24,897
Coach Jay.

128
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:29,026
Coach Jay is always with us
during rehearsals because staging-wise,

129
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,112
he consults with me.

130
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:33,155
I also give my input like,

131
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,199
"I think it would be nice
to stage it this way."

132
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,461
<i>For "Gento," I thought about</i>

133
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:50,339
what kind of hand gestures evoke
the phrase "Like this?"

134
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,008
Like this. "Gento."

135
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:55,011
So I was building off of this gesture.

136
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,429
How do we make it a dance?

137
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,140
Bingo.

138
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:01,142
In the province, don't we shake

139
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,185
- the Bingo tumbler like this?
- Yes.

140
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,104
That's how this step was formed.

141
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,356
<i>Bento</i>. When you hear the word <i>bento</i>,

142
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,984
isn't it this?
Like you're holding a <i>bento </i>box.

143
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:12,361
So there it is, <i>bento</i>. Easy, right?

144
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,197
<i>Pablo always asks me, "Jay, do you think</i>

145
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:18,075
<i>people will remember our choreography?"</i>

146
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,454
That's the challenge.
It has to be intentional.

147
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:25,499
So the way they wrote it, and how much
thought was put into the song,

148
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,336
the choreography
should reflect the intent.

149
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:31,297
We're not necessarily going wide.
It's more like going through the cave.

150
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,592
All right, I get it.
Like a tunnel inside a cave?

151
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:37,219
<i>A tunnel!</i>
<i>A tunnel that goes back to the house.</i>

152
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,055
<i>Ingay…</i>

153
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,348
<i>Wouldn't it be funny if</i>

154
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,808
there's someone on the floor,
on the dining table and whatnot.

155
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,311
Sitting on the sofa going "Gento!"

156
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:03,079
<i>A lot of people guide us</i>
<i>when we're making music</i>

157
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,706
so that we can convey meaning

158
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,250
or evoke a feeling
in our listeners through the song.

159
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,669
So…

160
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:13,255
Musically and sonically, for this EP,

161
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,509
besides having more freedom,

162
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:19,595
we're sure about the output of this work.

163
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:24,016
When we started collating ideas
for the album,

164
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:28,813
one thing we discussed was
genres we were looking to tackle.

165
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:32,149
Mr. August Rigo wrote us a song.

166
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:35,861
It's definitely a song with strong appeal,

167
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,155
but difficult to perform.

168
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:41,909
I'm more used to gritty singing

169
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:46,914
rather than controlling my voice
to be very sultry and R&B.

170
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,666
The first time I heard the song,

171
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,209
I said to myself,

172
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,211
"Will this song suit us?"
That was my first thought.

173
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:53,587
I was thinking about whether

174
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:56,841
we would be able to feel the song
when performing as a group.

175
00:11:56,924 --> 00:12:00,553
But when I heard our recording,

176
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:03,180
I was so excited by how we sounded.

177
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,925
<i>It's our first time trying</i>
<i>this kind of music video approach.</i>

178
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:44,513
We're excited to show our fans
and supporters this new kind of style.

179
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:48,100
<i>This music video has</i>
<i>a more artistic approach.</i>

180
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:51,979
It's simple,
but the direction is different

181
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:55,649
<i>because the way the clips are executed,</i>
<i>put together</i>

182
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:59,111
<i>and juxtaposed with the music</i>

183
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,447
makes it a sensory experience.

184
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:05,284
At first, I thought
it might be awkward for us

185
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:06,994
<i>since it's our first time trying</i>

186
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:09,955
<i>a music video without shots</i>
<i>of us dancing or singing.</i>

187
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:14,210
But looking at it now,
there is actually a sense of ease.

188
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,629
You just have to enjoy the process.

189
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,380
<i>We know we have many supporters.</i>

190
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:23,969
So we make sure the music we release
resonates with our listeners.

191
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:29,016
That's one of my motivations
for altering the lyrics.

192
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:32,686
But the essence of intimacy remains
in the song.

193
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:37,358
We would rather push boundaries
than stay in our comfort zone.

194
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:40,319
We've always said SB19 would get bolder.

195
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:43,322
Unwavering. So here it is.
This is the result.

196
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:44,490
<i>I think, well…</i>

197
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:50,204
Just kidding. It's going to be chaos!

198
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,219
<i>- When we perform it…</i>
<i>- I think our performance of</i>

199
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:06,762
"I Want You" is good.

200
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:10,516
I get the sense it's a crowd favorite

201
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,935
<i>because of the vibes, you know?</i>

202
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:17,064
<i>During the sexiest parts,</i>
<i>like the floor work,</i>

203
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:20,734
we can hear people screaming.

204
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,071
So this is what you want from us.

205
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,720
Cute, isn't it?

206
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,097
The background is much nicer.

207
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,099
What is that, Jah?

208
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,684
- Game Boy?
- Yeah.

209
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,060
Game Boy Color? What does it…

210
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:58,063
No, it's a combination. PS1, <i>Tekken</i>.

211
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,273
Stell's gift to me.

212
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,942
Stell's gift?
Stell got you a birthday gift in advance.

213
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,236
- It has all the games, even PS titles.
- All the games are in there.

214
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,657
It even has <i>Marvel vs. Capcom</i>
and <i>SNK vs. Capcom</i>.

215
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,492
Even <i>Mortal Kombat</i>.

216
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,577
- Even PS1?
- Really?

217
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,536
- Yes.
- <i>Mortal Kombat</i>?

218
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,996
Ask Stell to buy me one too.

219
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:30,054
I have the new tracks for the tour,

220
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,723
which is why I requested
for this music review.

221
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,934
So there are no surprises.

222
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:48,530
- Intro, live band. That's it.
- Yes, I've instructed that.

223
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,116
- And for the chorus…
- So, intro…

224
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,452
Just the intro and ending. Live band.

225
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,079
- Intro and ending only.
- Live band. Okay.

226
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,874
The light.

227
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,336
Something about the light.
But we listened to it and it seemed fine.

228
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:06,674
- My concern is the vibe has changed.
- Yes.

229
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,926
The feeling. Something just feels off.

230
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,934
Pau, can you and Ken do
the footwork on that line?

231
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:20,062
- I don't think I can, Jay.
- Okay, that's fine.

232
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:24,233
- Let's try it.
- Try crossing on that line.

233
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,488
I'm being so dramatic here.

234
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:30,572
Don't add drama!

235
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,740
But this would be so flat.

236
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,120
Where's the feeling in that?

237
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:43,544
<i>Why is that again?</i>

238
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,970
Move to the perimeter a little, Ken.

239
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,609
- Did you miss us?
- A little, since it's been cold!

240
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,196
They were with us
during the last WYAT tour.

241
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,117
That's right!

242
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,910
- You're good!
- Was that correct?

243
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,465
- That works too.
- The other one is better.

244
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,176
- Without?
- But this is the only vest left?

245
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:34,636
- Actually, it's fine with one sleeve.
- Right?

246
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,305
It's nice.

247
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:39,099
What do you think?

248
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,479
It bled through!

249
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:47,191
Snow told me,
"You made a mistake on this part."

250
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:49,902
I just continued doing the move.

251
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:54,031
Sorry, Snow. I'm only human.
Sometimes, I have problems too.

252
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,532
- Sorry.
- I'm kidding!

253
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,868
I'm shaking right now.

254
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,119
Are you nervous?

255
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,080
- Do you feel under pressure?
- Something like that.

256
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,875
Here we go again.

257
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,627
Nothing bad will happen.

258
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,921
I declare, only good things will happen.

259
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,548
Let's go, Pau!

260
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,102
KEN! LET'S DANCE BUDOTS

261
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,311
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, JUSTIN

262
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,681
Your energy is amazing.

263
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,349
We just finished performing,

264
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:05,060
but you brought our energy right back up.
Thank you, A'TIN!

265
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:42,097
<i>This is what you hear in the monitors?</i>

266
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:46,435
That's what plays in our ears.

267
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:59,156
I can't hear my voice
because of congestion. Annoying.

268
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:03,493
- That happens when you have a cold.
- Almost like even my ears are congested.

269
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,037
Try singing the line "pilit."

270
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,878
It feels awkward.

271
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:22,221
One of our big concerns is
the quality of our show.

272
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,556
When we found out about our US tour,

273
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:28,143
we knew there were some things
that had to be sacrificed.

274
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,437
First of which is,
bringing the Skouts on tour.

275
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:41,031
Just like any job or responsibility,
it wears you out sometimes.

276
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:44,159
But when we see you, Skouts,
doing your best,

277
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,119
<i>I get hyped and you uplift me.</i>

278
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:49,873
Even though you aren't coming on tour
with us in the US and Canada,

279
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,875
you're in our hearts.

280
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:55,170
Hopefully in the future,
we'll be on tour together.

281
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,713
Because we're stronger together.

282
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,299
When I see you all…

283
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,218
Oh no! I'm about to cry!

284
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,929
You won't be able to sing "Gento"!

285
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:08,642
<i>When I see all of you dance, I'm inspired</i>
<i>to keep getting better myself.</i>

286
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:11,812
I'm happy to be part of this family

287
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:14,189
and for the Skouts
to have become so established.

288
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,274
Thank you, Jay.

289
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,359
<i>How I wish that</i>

290
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:21,947
we came from a big company, a rich company

291
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:26,410
to show the fans
the best show we can give them.

292
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:33,834
But unfortunately,
we couldn't afford it, this time.

293
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,169
<i>From the beginning of this tour</i>
<i>until the end,</i>

294
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:39,756
let's stay hungry and eager
to perform with all our hearts.

295
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,174
Just like this. Justin is sick.

296
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,968
- Give an energetic performance.
- Pray for him.

297
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,595
- You can sing in his place!
- Please sing in my place.

298
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,228
- Gento!
- Gento!

299
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,858
Whatever resources or energy
we have at the moment,

300
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:00,360
our performance stays at 100 percent.

301
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,475
I sound like a robot.

302
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,351
Did you hear that?

303
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,609
Where are we going to eat? Over at…

304
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:45,072
<i>We were out of our element for this show.</i>

305
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:50,118
Since we modified our sound and visuals,
the set-up changed.

306
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:54,331
Our resolution now is
to have alignment sessions

307
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:57,375
with you and David,
and whoever else needed.

308
00:22:57,459 --> 00:23:01,588
<i>And with Bene for the cues,</i>
<i>whatever needs to be modified.</i>

309
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:04,257
It's important to iron out
any music problems

310
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,927
before the international tour.

311
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:12,015
We planned the world tour
even before making the album.

312
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:16,394
This is because our first world tour
received a good response.

313
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:20,398
We were capable of handling a world tour.
We proved we had an audience for it.

314
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,708
This is so fun! Oh no!

315
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,886
We are SB19.

316
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,199
<i>It was cold yesterday.</i>

317
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:15,078
<i>We did not expect it to be this cold.</i>

318
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:19,374
I knew the wind would make it cold,

319
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,585
but not that cold!

320
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:22,878
I think this is my favorite weather.

321
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:26,131
- Yes, I do prefer cooler weather.
- Yes, because

322
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:30,218
the weather here isn't
too hot or too cold.

323
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:33,054
It's just right. This weather is relaxing.

324
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:35,640
The heat in Texas was so…

325
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:39,144
Somehow so much hotter
than the Philippines!

326
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:41,188
Sunburn-prone weather.

327
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,773
It's 34 degrees Celsius, up to 36, right?

328
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:44,941
It's so hot.

329
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,193
So hot.

330
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:57,913
I'm excited,

331
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,998
but also uneasy.

332
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:03,293
<i>Because our next schedule</i>
<i>is two consecutive show days.</i>

333
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:04,461
<i>No rest in between.</i>

334
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:06,796
<i>Of course I'm excited to do a great show.</i>

335
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:09,549
The moment I stop getting excited,

336
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:12,969
I wouldn't be able to put my soul
into the performance.

337
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,389
I'm good. Let's go.

338
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:20,685
<i>Today, we're performing in Redwood City,</i>
<i>at the Fox Theater.</i>

339
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:42,958
<i>- Chaos.</i>
<i>- It's getting more complicated.</i>

340
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,335
Just imagine this is
a company team-building in Pansol.

341
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:49,631
- But what is this part though?
- That part goes around the armpit.

342
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:50,924
- No.
- I think it goes somewhere

343
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:53,009
- in the middle, Rain.
- Jah, I think that goes here.

344
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,844
This part seems to go around his neck.

345
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:58,473
This is what we love. Solving problems.

346
00:25:58,556 --> 00:26:00,976
- I got it!
- Wow, Justin de Dios is good at this.

347
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,978
Josh can wear it now!
This is the back piece.

348
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:03,937
This is it.

349
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,563
As long as we can get it on Josh,
that's good.

350
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,524
- This is the opening.
- Try it on.

351
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:08,525
What are we doing?

352
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:10,819
- I think this is correct.
- What about the back?

353
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:11,778
There!

354
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,115
It feels like a scene out of a movie.

355
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:17,909
You imagine you're performing
in front of so many people.

356
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:22,956
Do you picture the crowd in underwear
to calm your nerves?

357
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,374
No.

358
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:26,626
It feels more like
I'm the one in my underwear.

359
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,719
The difference between this tour
and our first world tour was,

360
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:38,138
we didn't really understand
our audience back then.

361
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:40,932
<i>There are Filipinos all over the world</i>

362
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:45,103
<i>and there are US-based A'TIN</i>
<i>who support us whenever we tour.</i>

363
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:49,399
<i>This time, we're focusing on casual fans.</i>

364
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:53,403
We want them to be the fuse

365
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:56,740
that ignites the momentum
toward our ultimate goal.

366
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:59,409
For SB19 to be known all over the world.

367
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:01,536
Then "Mapa." Stay.

368
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:02,454
When moving…

369
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,840
Same blocking with Snow.

370
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:16,718
That's it.

371
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:26,770
- Some parts aren't flattening!
- Yes.

372
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:28,146
It's all bumpy.

373
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:30,315
Do a second pass with the steamer later.

374
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:32,359
It's wrinkled.

375
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:33,943
I think this is okay.

376
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:51,127
Are you okay with the cues, Bene?
Can we do a sound check then?

377
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,129
<i>Performing here is nerve-wracking</i>

378
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,423
<i>because we're performing</i>
<i>for international fans.</i>

379
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:58,676
<i>Though they've been fully converted</i>
<i>into A'TIN, but of course,</i>

380
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,971
<i>they will do their best</i>
<i>to bring in new fans</i>

381
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:05,475
such as their friends or family members
that they will bring to our concerts.

382
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:08,686
<i>That doubles our nervousness,</i>

383
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:13,316
because the people they bring in
who are just curious or casual fans,

384
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,695
it's our job to convert them fully
into A'TIN, through and through.

385
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:20,281
Or at least,
make them listen to our music.

386
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:28,081
Come on.

387
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:31,418
They're going.

388
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,673
- Here we go again.
- Please grab your mics.

389
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,967
They're making a lot of noise.

390
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,428
The venue is almost
at full capacity today.

391
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:43,346
Even the balcony is occupied.

392
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,015
They sold tickets for the balcony

393
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:49,144
since there's demand for it
here in San Francisco.

394
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,479
So it's a full house.

395
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,716
<i>Every time we perform, we make sure that</i>

396
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:25,138
we're performing on a new level,
with a stronger approach to our shows.

397
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:39,569
<i>It serves to challenge us</i>

398
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:43,573
<i>in making sure</i>
<i>the next show is better than the last,</i>

399
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:44,908
<i>and even the current one.</i>

400
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:06,387
Performing "La Luna" on
consecutive days is killing me.

401
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,806
Because I have to sustain that anger.

402
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,641
Try singing it sweetly.

403
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:10,600
You'd enter this way.

404
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,874
- That…
- Please come down.

405
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,212
That's it.

406
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:41,673
Whose phone is this?

407
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:45,343
If there's nothing to be taken…

408
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:47,387
None.

409
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:51,599
<i>It's 11:55 p.m.</i>
<i>Five minutes to go before midnight.</i>

410
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:55,812
<i>We're on our way to Los Angeles</i>
<i>for our next show.</i>

411
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:58,648
<i>It will take us six hours to get there.</i>

412
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:00,275
It can get tiring, but of course,

413
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:06,322
this is the kind of experience
that's very unforgettable for us.

414
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:09,033
To think "Wow, we just did a show,

415
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,703
<i>but right after that,</i>
<i>we're doing another one."</i>

416
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:19,252
<i>We enjoy what we're doing.</i>
<i>It's a lot of fun.</i>

417
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:23,339
<i>Of course we're determined to give</i>
<i>our best to make each show great</i>

418
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:26,009
<i>so we don't disappoint our fans.</i>

419
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:31,014
<i>This is the best thing we can do</i>
<i>as a way of thanking them</i>

420
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:32,432
<i>to make them happy.</i>

421
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,028
Can you fit in there?

422
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,083
<i>The stage is beautiful.</i>

423
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,962
Also, this venue looks huge.
Just look at the capacity.

424
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:05,506
<i>I'll admit this venue is giving.</i>

425
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,383
<i>For performers,</i>

426
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:10,136
<i>it really adds value</i>
<i>when the set-up is beautiful.</i>

427
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:11,429
<i>It heightens the feeling.</i>

428
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:13,222
<i>A great sound system, great lighting…</i>

429
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,600
And everything. The whole thing.

430
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,355
- Give me the rest.
- There! That's okay.

431
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:27,362
<i>San Francisco and LA are stops</i>
<i>we've toured before.</i>

432
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:30,365
It was our first time
at Chicago and Dallas though.

433
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:35,244
<i>To be honest, ticket sales were struggling</i>
<i>before we got to US.</i>

434
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:38,498
<i>We were worried</i>
<i>we wouldn't be able to fill the venues.</i>

435
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:41,084
But when we got there,
we were at full capacity.

436
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:44,128
So that was cool.
Usually, they only knew "Gento."

437
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,589
<i>They didn't sing along much</i>
<i>to the other songs.</i>

438
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:49,425
Some people would sing along
here and there

439
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,386
<i>because we're a foreign group.</i>

440
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:55,181
But as it turned out,
they enjoyed themselves.

441
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:00,186
Full capacity tonight?

442
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:01,270
Does that include the balcony?

443
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:02,563
No.

444
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:03,898
Just the orchestra.

445
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:04,983
In fairness though…

446
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:08,361
We've added glowing stage lights.

447
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:09,862
It will light up during the blackout.

448
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,240
Maybe it's in mono?

449
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:16,119
It was in mono.
Now we've switched it to stereo.

450
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:19,163
- Don't panic on us.
- It was in stereo, but panned left!

451
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,748
- Okay.
- It's working now.

452
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,042
- You good? Perfect.
- I got nervous for a second.

453
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:25,962
- Do you want to try "Crimzone" first?
- That made me nervous.

454
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:29,549
<i>So far, it's been super tiring because</i>

455
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:34,012
<i>besides doing back-to-back shows,</i>

456
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:37,056
we travel,
the weather changes in every city,

457
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,309
and we have other activities
besides the shows.

458
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:42,979
<i>I'm just going to soak up good vibes now,</i>
<i>so that the show will be enjoyable.</i>

459
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,481
<i>Even if my body feels heavy,</i>

460
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,859
<i>the important thing is</i>
<i>to enjoy being on stage.</i>

461
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:51,029
So, let's go. We'll persevere.

462
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:22,310
Make way.

463
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,687
Stell, move to the side.
That's the path for people.

464
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,689
Please watch your step.

465
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:27,857
Okay, one minute to go.

466
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:30,485
I beat my own record yesterday.

467
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,445
<i>- I only used one "Lola" yesterday.</i>
<i>- SB, ready.</i>

468
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:34,530
But your performance was good yesterday.

469
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:38,409
- Maybe you shouldn't be doing "Lola."
- I just said I did "Lola" yesterday.

470
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:41,079
- What if you stop doing it?
- Please be ready.

471
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:43,664
You told me not to do it,

472
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:46,125
but I just said…

473
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:56,886
<i>It feels like</i>

474
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:58,679
<i>the cards are stacked against us.</i>

475
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:03,017
We're taking a chance by going on tour.
That's how risky it feels.

476
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:08,022
<i>No matter what, we have to make it.</i>
<i>You need to toughen up.</i>

477
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:14,195
Besides being fun to watch
because we had backup dancers with us,

478
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:17,615
<i>the important thing was</i>
<i>the Skouts always gave us energy.</i>

479
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:42,473
Please go to stage left.

480
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:45,434
<i>Every time we perform with the Skouts,</i>

481
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,353
we feel a lot stronger.

482
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:52,692
The energy of having more
than ten people cheering along with you

483
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:55,862
and performing with you on stage
really takes the nerves away.

484
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:08,833
- Very tiring. Back-to-back.
- All the traveling.

485
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:12,712
There are times when it feels like
you've hardly sat down

486
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:14,463
and it's time to do it all over again.

487
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:17,049
Whatever sleep you get
feels over in a blink.

488
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:19,260
"Oh we're here? Let's go, prepare.

489
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,262
- Do makeup now."
- On the bus.

490
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,639
What worries us most is our voices.

491
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,016
Being so tired…

492
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:28,269
Because we're going full out for what…
Almost two hours?

493
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:31,480
The concert is almost two hours.

494
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:34,942
You're singing for two hours
because the mics are on!

495
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:42,116
You're performing that show
and doing it again on little to no sleep.

496
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:49,790
<i>Josh, did you announce that</i>
<i>SB19's busking today?</i>

497
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,169
I just posted
we're up to "something special."

498
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:55,213
You told me not to be specific.

499
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:59,884
- <i>It's your first time busking, right?</i>
- First time.

500
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:02,053
No, we've gone busking before.

501
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:04,096
We even sang "Give It to Me Now."

502
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,266
- <i>You've gone busking before?</i>
- It was when…

503
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,852
- When you weren't part of our staff yet.
- <i>Oh really?</i>

504
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,037
Hello, again!

505
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:21,507
They said we'll move forward,
we'll move forward.

506
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,157
Can you help carry this? Be careful.

507
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,533
<i>If I had such a cool office,</i>

508
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:33,037
I'd finish a month's worth of work
in three days.

509
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,656
Wave to your right.

510
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:18,833
<i>Miss Em, is today your birthday?</i>

511
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,626
It's tomorrow.

512
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:22,545
- But if we were in the Philippines…
- It would be today?

513
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,345
How old are you? Eighteen?

514
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,347
- Seventeen.
- Seventeen.

515
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:46,402
<i>Are we going to meet the expectations</i>
<i>of everyone coming to see us?</i>

516
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:48,529
<i>How will they respond to us?</i>

517
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,990
<i>I ask myself, did they find the show good?</i>

518
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:55,077
Were they satisfied with our performance?
Did we make them happy?

519
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,163
I like this setting.

520
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:59,915
Loraine, is this standing room only?

521
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,375
- Yes!
- Cool.

522
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,169
- I like it.
- Party!

523
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:04,253
That's right!

524
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:08,299
I just want us to be successful
and for our fans to be happy,

525
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:10,968
<i>for us to be healthy</i>
<i>all the time and safe.</i>

526
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:20,144
<i>We aren't going back to the Philippines</i>
<i>for a while.</i>

527
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,649
I'd never make it as
an Overseas Filipino Worker.

528
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:29,069
- Does this go inside your undershirt?
- No, it can go inside the jacket.

529
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,279
- Leah?
- Yes?

530
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:32,615
<i>Do you think I can--</i>

531
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:33,991
Place it inside my undershirt.

532
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:36,368
Depending on my voice tonight,
should I sing "La Luna"?

533
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,829
Yes. But how do you feel now?

534
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:41,123
I'll know later,
once they start their solos.

535
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:43,250
What song did you put
on standby for this show?

536
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,045
- Is it "Kumunoy"?
- "Kumunoy."

537
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,590
Okay, a few reminders.

538
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:53,636
This is a walk-up.
So when you're going down,

539
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:55,262
pay attention to the signs
for your dressing area.

540
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,765
- Yes.
- You will be doing your own quick changes.

541
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:02,186
- Leah, do we have any "Lola" left?
- Yes, with me.

542
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:23,082
<i>One of our goals is</i>

543
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:27,044
to bring Filipino music
to the world scene.

544
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:29,588
And to leave a legacy, you know?

545
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:33,259
<i>When they talk about Filipino pop,</i>
<i>I want everyone to think,</i>

546
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:36,470
"SB19. They represent Filipino pop."

547
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:42,184
<i>Hopefully, more artists get</i>
<i>the opportunities that we've gotten</i>

548
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:48,107
so that we can help each other
boost Filipino music and culture.

549
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,776
Quick change for everyone.

550
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:53,237
- Quick change!
- Hard stop!

551
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,613
Ken, you're going the wrong way.

552
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,031
- Ken, here.
- Quick change, hard stop!

553
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:57,491
- Where's my spot?
- Passing behind you!

554
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,410
- To the left.
- I think I can pass here.

555
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:01,620
- Who went downstairs?
- Ken went all the way down.

556
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:04,915
- I thought he would run to the car.
- Ken went all the way down.

557
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,667
- Ken, all the clothes are here.
- Are these mine?

558
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:09,920
- Xi-Anne!
- Yes.

559
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,297
Get a shot closer to the stage.

560
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,716
Do we have a tissue?

561
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:18,470
Pablo!

562
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:21,432
Pablo!

563
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:06,894
Maybe it's just that

564
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:08,854
this is not a good day.

565
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:12,816
<i>Maybe it's the weather</i>
<i>or just a coincidence.</i>

566
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,751
<i>Of course, not every day</i>
<i>can be a good day.</i>

567
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:36,006
<i>Most of the time,</i>
<i>we take turns having rough days.</i>

568
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:42,638
<i>Hopefully, we'll all be okay soon.</i>

569
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:17,631
Especially for enduring
everything that's happened

570
00:45:17,714 --> 00:45:21,135
from our first show
until our show yesterday.

571
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:23,971
Anyway, I want you all
to thank yourselves.

572
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:27,766
And SB19, again, you know this.

573
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:38,902
Thank you for the life
of every single person here.

574
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:42,072
For every single person
who makes up this show.

575
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:46,994
What high energy.

576
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,204
We've run out of energy, haven't we?

577
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:52,166
Let's do it once more. First, inhale.

578
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:55,043
- Can you inhale?
- Inhale, and then release.

579
00:45:56,753 --> 00:45:58,797
Loraine, are you sure
we should be facing each other?

580
00:45:58,881 --> 00:45:59,882
Step back!

581
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:01,925
- Step back when you exhale.
- One more time!

582
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:03,302
Step back, and…

583
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:08,682
It smelled good during the inhale.

584
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:10,100
You smell anything?

585
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:12,311
- All right, everyone, mic up.
- Smells like <i>chop suey</i>.

586
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:59,399
Is my mic on stage?

587
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:12,913
Justin!

588
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:25,717
Pablo, you changed clothes?

589
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:29,555
Pablo!

590
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:34,393
Pablo!

591
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:36,853
How do you react
when it gets nerve-wracking?

592
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:39,147
- Let it be.
- Just keep singing?

593
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:41,817
<i>When I'm performing on stage,</i>

594
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:45,612
I try to imagine no one's watching,

595
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:49,324
so I can give it my all
without holding back.

596
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:53,161
<i>But hearing people sing your song</i>
<i>is the best feeling ever.</i>

597
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:02,421
<i>I end up feeling like,</i>
<i>from so many people,</i>

598
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:03,463
<i>we've become one voice.</i>

599
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:09,386
It's amazing how even foreign
or casual fans know the lyrics.

600
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:11,722
<i>That's the best feeling</i>
<i>for an artist because</i>

601
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:13,599
<i>though there's a language barrier,</i>

602
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:15,559
they really make an effort
to learn our songs.

603
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:17,811
It's fulfilling. It makes you feel like

604
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:21,523
you're doing what you were meant to do.

605
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:22,983
You were meant to perform.

606
00:48:57,976 --> 00:49:01,855
<i>A lot of people ask me about "Crimzone"</i>
<i>because of these lyrics I wrote.</i>

607
00:49:01,938 --> 00:49:05,734
<i>"This is all I can give.</i>
<i>My blood, sweat, and tears.</i>

608
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:08,278
<i>That's why I stay unbothered."</i>

609
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:12,032
First of all, you have
to be willing to work hard

610
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:15,369
<i>and spend hours upon hours</i>
<i>pursuing that certain dream.</i>

611
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:16,828
<i>Blood is symbolic.</i>

612
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,997
<i>Giving everything your full heart,</i>
<i>passion, and everything.</i>

613
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:21,124
<i>As for the tears,</i>
<i>trust that any pursuit brings tears</i>

614
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:26,254
because the road to success
to big things is very difficult.

615
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:29,633
<i>It becomes worth it once you realize</i>

616
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:31,468
<i>the most valuable things in life</i>

617
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:34,429
<i>are the experiences you undergo</i>
<i>through living.</i>

618
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:37,891
That's what's so fun about "Crimzone."
It's essentially a party song.

619
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:35,699
<i>Everything was red-hot for us.</i>
<i>Then suddenly, it came to a standstill.</i>

620
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:38,660
<i>Silence.</i>

621
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:41,371
<i>SB19's sudden silence.</i>

622
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:47,377
My mom received a letter

623
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:49,838
which she sent to me.

624
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:52,924
The contents of which stated

625
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:55,552
we, SB19, were not allowed…

626
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:58,555
- To use…
- To use the name "SB19."

627
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:01,767
So technically, we could no longer perform

628
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,310
<i>as SB19.</i>

629
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:06,980
<i>Back then, we were focused on</i>
<i>staging new performances</i>

630
00:51:07,063 --> 00:51:08,190
<i>for our anniversary.</i>

631
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:11,735
<i>Our anniversary celebration</i>
<i>was a month-long event.</i>

632
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:14,237
<i>It featured an exhibit</i>
<i>and various events planned by our staff.</i>

633
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:16,656
<i>We were preparing a performance</i>
<i>with a medley of songs.</i>

634
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,367
<i>We even got fancy new mic stands.</i>

635
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:21,244
<i>We thought we were ready for everything</i>

636
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:23,830
<i>until we received the bad news.</i>

637
00:51:31,129 --> 00:51:33,298
Everyone in our company was stressed out

638
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:36,384
because we didn't know
how to control the damage

639
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:40,847
or how to face the problem,
how to resolve it.

640
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,182
I was so anxious.

641
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:44,434
I kept asking myself,
"Why did this happen?"

642
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:46,102
I thought everything was fine.

643
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:47,938
We didn't know how to react.

644
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:50,816
We couldn't understand
how we ended up in that situation.

645
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:53,860
The most immediate discussion was
about how to resolve it

646
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:55,904
because we couldn't bear the idea

647
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:58,949
of our company
going through such uncertainty.

648
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:04,579
And this happened just two days
before our anniversary concert,

649
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:05,747
of course that felt stressful.

650
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:08,583
- Imagine being mid-practice,
- Wondering if we should even continue.

651
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:11,044
practicing so hard
knowing the possibility of

652
00:52:11,127 --> 00:52:13,171
canceling the anniversary was so likely.

653
00:52:17,133 --> 00:52:19,970
So we tried to change everything.

654
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:24,015
From the script to the logos
<i>to LED screen displays.</i>

655
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:25,267
<i>We removed all traces of SB19.</i>

656
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:27,102
But for existing materials…

657
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:30,730
Well, they were already printed,
so we just went with it.

658
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:32,566
<i>We started canceling shows.</i>

659
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:36,069
<i>There were issues about whether</i>

660
00:52:36,152 --> 00:52:38,280
we could continue as a group because--

661
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:39,865
- It's all problems.
- One after another.

662
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:45,662
It was painful to see
how our Asian tour cancellations

663
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:50,834
affected Filipino and other A'TIN living
near our Asian tour stops.

664
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:53,044
To see how our fans booked their flights…

665
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:56,673
To see how excited they were,
only for us to cancel the concerts.

666
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:59,926
- We canceled the concerts one by one.
- That was the toughest part for us.

667
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,762
No matter how much we wanted
to comfort them,

668
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:03,847
we couldn't do anything.

669
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:06,975
We felt guilty
for all the effort our fans put in.

670
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:09,269
Their effort in watching out
for our tour dates.

671
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:12,814
We really wanted to perform
in those countries,

672
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:19,112
but this problem wasn't something
we knew how to solve

673
00:53:19,195 --> 00:53:22,532
- during those times.
- Because no one expected it to happen.

674
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:29,623
Many fans were wondering why
the cancellations were announced so late.

675
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:31,333
Why announce only a day
before the concert date?

676
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:37,714
It's because I think at that time,
all the teams involved in the issue

677
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:39,424
and the production of the show,

678
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:41,134
they really tried their best,

679
00:53:41,217 --> 00:53:43,386
to the point of hoping for a miracle.

680
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,639
Maybe there was still hope

681
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:49,684
<i>to resolve things even if</i>
<i>we were counting down to the hour</i>

682
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:51,937
before the day of the concert.

683
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,939
They held out hope that maybe

684
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:55,440
we could still push through
with the shows.

685
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:58,193
<i>We worked so hard</i>
<i>and went through so many things</i>

686
00:53:58,276 --> 00:54:00,278
<i>in order to establish our group.</i>

687
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:02,072
<i>Our album is even named </i>Pagtatag!

688
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:05,617
<i>We were so confident in claiming,</i>
<i>"Here we are, stronger than ever."</i>

689
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:11,039
Only to experience
that strength erode so suddenly.

690
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:12,958
Is this how things end for us?

691
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:14,918
No matter which way I looked at it,
we seemed to be losing.

692
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:18,713
Personally, I don't see myself as being
particularly stable in life already.

693
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:26,012
And now we're back to square one.

694
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:28,765
You know how we had this goal

695
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:32,102
of making sure Original Filipino Music
became known in the global scene.

696
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:35,939
And then it felt like that dream was over.

697
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:38,024
Maybe we would have just settled for less.

698
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:41,444
There were events at that time
where they didn't use the name "SB19."

699
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:44,072
The event pushed through
using their own names,

700
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:46,199
Pablo, Josh, Stell, Ken and Justin.

701
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:50,704
<i>Or the posters and publicity materials</i>
<i>reflected the intent to push through.</i>

702
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:02,966
On the management side,
we were very scared at that time.

703
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:05,427
We were uncertain about what could happen,

704
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:09,097
but we couldn't show the five of them

705
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:12,183
that we were afraid.

706
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:15,687
Because performing is difficult enough

707
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:18,023
even without the burden of such a problem.

708
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:21,276
I asked for updates all the time,
like, "What's going on now?

709
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,153
Why is this dragging on so long?

710
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:24,529
What's going to happen next?

711
00:55:24,612 --> 00:55:25,905
Haven't we resolved it yet?"

712
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:28,033
It was a restless time.

713
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:30,535
- I couldn't sleep at night.
- Really.

714
00:55:30,618 --> 00:55:32,412
We had meetings every day for it.

715
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:36,332
From morning to evening,
every two hours, I think?

716
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:37,375
We would be in meetings.

717
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:40,003
Because we had so many pending events.

718
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:43,506
Whichever ones we could retain,
we managed to retain.

719
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:45,675
But the events we had to sacrifice…

720
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:48,428
For example, the events that
we could attend, we thought,

721
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:50,555
"Okay, let's just use our own names.

722
00:55:50,638 --> 00:55:53,224
Better to go than make things worse."

723
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:02,150
This next song

724
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:07,155
is our letter to each
and every one of you.

725
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:10,825
We'll be together forever.

726
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:13,745
This Beloved Five
will be with you forever.

727
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:40,897
<i>Even without the name,</i>

728
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,816
<i>A'TIN were still supporting us.</i>

729
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:44,984
<i>They reminded us by saying</i>

730
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:49,948
<i>we're still the Beloved Five,</i>
<i>even without the name "SB19."</i>

731
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:53,660
<i>Even if we lose that name.</i>

732
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:57,372
It lifted my spirits and kept me going.

733
00:56:57,455 --> 00:57:00,834
It motivated me to say,
"Okay, we can withstand this."

734
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:22,605
<i>I love them because</i>

735
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:25,733
for me, they inspire me
that my dreams, not just mine,

736
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:28,069
but all A'TIN's dreams,
even casual fans' dreams.

737
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:30,780
They show us that
achieving our dreams is possible

738
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:32,449
if you just keep going.

739
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:37,328
They can relate to people
from all walks of life.

740
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:40,623
I discovered them while working on a ship.

741
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:44,169
They really helped my mental health

742
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:48,214
because working on a ship gets
difficult and lonely.

743
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:57,015
If I can send them a message directly,

744
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:59,309
I hope you don't disband.

745
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:02,312
Because you're our stress relievers

746
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:04,939
and the happy pills
for us senior citizens.

747
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:11,112
You've made a huge impact
on the people you've entertained.

748
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:13,114
Thank you very much.

749
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:19,329
You're also the reason
why A'TIN like me never give up.

750
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:24,667
You will remain in my heart
and in our hearts forever.

751
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:28,046
A'TIN will be with us
no matter what name we go by.

752
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:31,424
And I know the people surrounding us
never lose faith.

753
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:35,178
Because they're even the ones
pouring their energy

754
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:39,349
into resolving the conflict
we were facing.

755
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:42,602
That's how important our dream is to them.

756
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:45,522
<i>The term "Mahalima" is now trending</i>
<i>among netizens,</i>

757
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:47,607
<i>which is A'TIN's nickname for the group.</i>

758
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:52,070
<i>This follows the members' removal</i>
<i>of the name SB19</i>

759
00:58:52,153 --> 00:58:54,447
<i>from their respective</i>
<i>Instagram handles and bios.</i>

760
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:59,994
Mahalima!

761
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:59,053
It slowed down,
and then Justin's mic turned off.

762
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:00,471
What happened?

763
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:03,057
I don't know.

764
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:05,059
It seemed to stop at the same time.

765
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:07,770
<i>But the bitterness is not enough</i>
<i>For the haters</i>

766
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:09,355
Then the music would turn off.

767
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:10,815
The mics don't work now.

768
01:00:10,898 --> 01:00:13,151
- Check.
- <i>It will make noise</i>

769
01:00:13,234 --> 01:00:14,611
I also can't hear
any of you on the monitors.

770
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:16,696
Let's keep going, as long as
the music doesn't stop.

771
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:19,449
Please don't turn off their mics
without telling them.

772
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:25,913
<i>People who are on our side.</i>

773
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:29,375
Just imagine,
despite all the problems we faced,

774
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:31,210
they still stayed with us.

775
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:35,048
<i>Out of all the people</i>
<i>we could've worked with,</i>

776
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:37,425
<i>we could've met people who hung around</i>

777
01:00:37,508 --> 01:00:39,552
<i>just because they needed</i>
<i>something from us.</i>

778
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:41,512
<i>But they're with us to help us</i>

779
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:44,557
<i>and guide our decisions,</i>
<i>not just as a group,</i>

780
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:46,809
<i>but in our personal lives as well.</i>

781
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:53,024
As long as we have A'TIN,
we'll keep chasing our dreams.

782
01:01:57,213 --> 01:02:01,801
What matters most is continuing the work
behind the name you've established.

783
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:07,014
<i>We came to an amicable agreement.</i>

784
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:09,267
Now let's focus on our goal.

785
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:11,144
Let's focus on making up for lost time.

786
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:15,148
Let's focus on achieving your dreams.

787
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:27,577
<i>Once we solved the issue,</i>
<i>we were back on track.</i>

788
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:30,496
<i>You won't easily find something like this</i>

789
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:37,420
<i>Our listeners here at Tag 91.1</i>

790
01:02:37,503 --> 01:02:40,757
<i>keep requesting for your songs.</i>

791
01:03:01,402 --> 01:03:03,905
<i>Filipino artists usually perform</i>
<i>in music festivals here.</i>

792
01:03:03,988 --> 01:03:07,033
<i>But this is the first solo paid concert</i>

793
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:10,828
<i>after Vice Ganda's,</i>
<i>which was ten years ago.</i>

794
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:13,247
<i>This is another milestone</i>
<i>for the SB19 story.</i>

795
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:22,507
During that time, we thought
no one could hear our problems.

796
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:24,467
We thought we were alone.

797
01:03:25,426 --> 01:03:29,722
Knowing A'TIN has our back
is really amazing.

798
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:32,558
Pagtatag! World Tour!

799
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:08,302
Back then, we only dreamed
of releasing a song.

800
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:11,681
But now we're here,
receiving an award in front of all of you.

801
01:04:11,764 --> 01:04:18,354
This is a big deal to us and
to the entire community of Filipino music.

802
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:03,190
We just need the vocals
as a guide for the rap part.

803
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:09,780
So the plan is
to take it directly from the tailors

804
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:11,657
and measure it on them.

805
01:05:16,954 --> 01:05:18,664
SB, stay in place.

806
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:31,177
The end of the Pagtatag! era.

807
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:35,306
We've been dramatizing it that way.
We've done 18 shows, right?

808
01:05:36,015 --> 01:05:40,227
I think we've done 18 shows
for the Pagtatag! tour.

809
01:05:40,311 --> 01:05:44,607
I don't really feel the finality
since everything is still going on.

810
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:46,525
But maybe tomorrow, on its final day,

811
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:49,111
I will properly feel
it's the end of the Pagtatag! tour.

812
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:52,615
But I'm excited because
it feels like a brand-new show.

813
01:05:52,698 --> 01:05:58,454
<i>Raise those lightsticks up!</i>

814
01:05:58,537 --> 01:06:00,748
At the count of three.

815
01:06:11,425 --> 01:06:14,220
Stand as you wave!

816
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:16,472
And back!

817
01:06:22,019 --> 01:06:23,980
- It's beautiful, like stars.
- Once more.

818
01:06:24,063 --> 01:06:25,314
One more time.

819
01:06:27,566 --> 01:06:29,026
To the very end, A'TIN.

820
01:06:30,194 --> 01:06:32,947
Let's stay together for…

821
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:35,866
Freedom!

822
01:07:23,664 --> 01:07:25,124
<i>What was very memorable?</i>

823
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:29,086
Just being with the four of them

824
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:30,337
<i>on stage.</i>

825
01:07:31,338 --> 01:07:33,049
<i>Even though I may not tell them.</i>

826
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:36,385
We'd be embarrassed
to admit it to each other.

827
01:07:36,469 --> 01:07:37,678
We're very…

828
01:07:37,762 --> 01:07:40,222
You might say…

829
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:41,432
Loony.

830
01:07:41,515 --> 01:07:44,018
Goofy kids who do nothing,
but tease each other.

831
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:48,189
But I'm very happy that we're together.

832
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:56,697
We didn't really plan to have
such an exuberant ending.

833
01:07:56,781 --> 01:07:59,992
Yes, we know that
finales are usually a big celebration,

834
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:02,161
but the happiness we feel is more like

835
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:04,455
being reborn?

836
01:08:04,538 --> 01:08:06,624
At least that's how it feels for me.

837
01:08:08,542 --> 01:08:10,294
The finale has re-energized me.

838
01:08:14,381 --> 01:08:16,050
<i>It's a cycle.</i>

839
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:19,470
<i>You reach one peak and begin again.</i>

840
01:08:19,553 --> 01:08:24,016
So, the journey itself
is always interesting.

841
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:25,935
The journey is always exciting.

842
01:08:26,018 --> 01:08:32,942
I'm excited to see
where new paths will lead us.

843
01:08:36,487 --> 01:08:40,032
For the <i>Pagtatag! </i>finale,
our group feels like this.

844
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:41,826
I don't know why
we've become so close again.

845
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:46,455
So I'm very happy
and I hope we become even closer.

846
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:55,131
<i>I can't explain how grateful I am</i>

847
01:08:55,214 --> 01:09:00,928
<i>Fans don't get to see the people</i>
<i>who are behind everything we do.</i>

848
01:09:01,011 --> 01:09:03,055
We're exhausted after the show,

849
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:05,266
<i>but seeing them visit us…</i>

850
01:09:05,349 --> 01:09:07,017
<i>Our families came to see us.</i>

851
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:09,937
<i>Josh's and Stell's families came,</i>
<i>everyone took photos.</i>

852
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:11,313
<i>Co-workers from 1Z came to see us.</i>

853
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:12,898
Who else?

854
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:14,316
You, the documentary team.

855
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:17,361
Even our old team came to see us.

856
01:09:17,444 --> 01:09:22,533
We see our friends and family
looking at us with pride.

857
01:09:22,616 --> 01:09:25,411
I can't help but feel my heart is full.

858
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:44,180
<i>We want the world to know.</i>
